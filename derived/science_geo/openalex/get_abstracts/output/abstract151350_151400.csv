Vitamin A (retinol) and its derivatives (retinal, retinoic acid) are C20 isoprenoids metabolically derived from the oxidative cleavage of C40 carotenoids (Fig.1). Most effects of vitamin A are exerted by retinoic acid (1.Dowling J.E. Wald G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 587-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Chytil F. Livrea M.A. Vidali G. Retinoids: From Basic Science to Clinical Applications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 11-19Google Scholar). In the visual system, retinal or closely related compounds such as 3-hydroxyretinal serve as chromophores for the various visual pigments (rhodopsins) (3.Wald G.

Although the cleavage of β-carotene to form retinal in animals has been investigated in cell-free systems for about 50 years, this important enzymatic step has resisted molecular analysis (5.Moore T.

Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 21-28Google Scholar), and the specific enzyme has yet to be purified. Despite compelling evidence in several experimental systems for a central cleavage of β-carotene yielding two molecules of retinal, there is still an ongoing debate as to the significance of eccentric cleavage of β-carotene (10.Napoli J.L. Race K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17372-17377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic oxidative cleavage of carotenoids is also found in bacteria and plants. In higher plants, many examples of eccentric carotenoid cleavage are found. These examples include the formation of saffron in crocus, citraurin and other apocarotenoids in citrus fruits, and most interestingly for us, the plant hormone abcisic acid, a growth regulator involved,e.g. in the autumnal fall of leaves and in seed dormancy. Abcisic acid derives from the oxidative cleavage of 9-cisepoxy carotenoids at the 11–12 carbon double bond. Recently, analysis of a maize mutant, vp14, which is defective in abcisic acid biosynthesis, has led to a better molecular understanding of this cleavage reaction. The cloning of the corresponding gene revealed that the encoded protein catalyzes this oxidative cleavage to form xanthoxin, the direct precursor of abcisic acid (11.Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Vp14 shares weak sequence homology to several proteins of unknown function in the data bases, among which are some from animals.We wondered whether animal homologues of vp14 might also act as dioxygenases and whether oxidative cleavage of carotenoids with provitamin A activity is performed by a similar enzyme in animals. The present paper answers this question positively. We cloned and identified a β-carotene dioxygenase (β-diox)1 fromDrosophila melanogaster by expressing it into the background of an Escherichia coli strain capable of synthesizing and accumulating the direct percursor, β-carotene (provitamin A). The use of this novel test system for the first time allowed the molecular identification of a vitamin A-forming enzyme. It revealed that the protein catalyzes the centric cleavage of β-carotene, leading exclusively to the formation of C20-compounds (retinoids).RESULTSTo find homologues of vp14, the plant carotenoid-cleaving enzyme, we searched insect EST libraries and discovered a published EST fragment from D. melanogaster (GenBank™ accession numberAI063857). For cloning of the full-length cDNA and to test directly for β-carotene dioxygenase activity, an E. coli strain was constructed that was able to synthesize and accumulate β-carotene by introducing the gene set for β-carotene biosynthesis from the bacterium E. herbicola (12.Hundle B.S. Alberti M. Nievelstein V. Beyer P. Kleinig H. Armstrong G.A. Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This approach allowed the detection of retinoid formation by the fading of the colonies from yellow (β-carotene) to almost white (retinoids) and offered a fast and efficient test system to identify β-carotene dioxygenase activity. For this purpose, total RNA was isolated fromDrosophila heads, and cDNA was synthesized. RACE-PCR was performed with a specific oligonucleotide derived from the EST fragment and a dT17-anchor oligonucleotide. The PCR products obtained were directly cloned into the expression vector pBAD-TOPO and transformed into the described E. coli strain. After plating the bacteria on LB media containing 0.2% l-arabinose to induce the expression of the putative β-carotene dioxygenase, several almost-white colonies were found and subjected to further analysis (Fig. 2). Overnight cultures were grown under safety red light to minimize isomerization and unspecific cleavage of β-carotene by photo-oxidation. β-Carotene and retinoids were extracted and subjected to HPLC analyses. The control strain transformed with the vector alone lacked the ability to cleave β-carotene, and no traces of retinoids were detectable. However, bacteria expressing the Drosophila cDNA contained significant amounts of retinoids in addition to β-carotene (Fig.3 A). The retinoids were identified by retention time as well as co-chromatography with authentic standards and by their absorption spectra (Fig.4). The dominant retinal isomer was the all-trans form, with only ∼20% of the 13-cisisomer. Depending on the time bacteria were grown after induction, significant amounts of all-trans retinol and 13-cis retinol as well as esters of these retinol isomers could be detected. The retinoid isomers found were consistent with the isomeric composition of their β-carotene precursors, which were identified by a separate HPLC system. To confirm the formation of retinals and to improve the yield of retinoids as well as the separation of their isomers, extraction was also performed in the presence of hydroxylamine. Fig. 3 B shows that this treatment leads to the formation of the all-trans and 13-cis retinal oximes, with a corresponding blueshift of their absorption spectra. The analyses demonstrated that besides retinal, significant amounts of retinol as well as retinyl esters were formed in E. coli (Table I). Since E. coli was able to metabolize retinal to retinol, the question arose of whether retinoic acids were also formed. For the analyses of retinoic acid formation, the cells were lysed, and the extracts were analyzed on an HPLC system using an established protocol (14.Thaller C. Eichele G. Nature. 1987; 327: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The results revealed that, under these conditions, significant amounts of retinal as well as retinol could be detected, but that no retinoic acids were formed in E. coli.Figure 2Color shift due to the cleavage of β-carotene to retinoids in E. coli. The picture shows the color shift from yellow (β-carotene) to almost white (retinoids) in β-carotene producing and accumulating E. coli caused by the expression of the β-carotene dioxygenase from D. melanogaster (E. coli (+) strain) compared with the control (E. coli (−) strain).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3HPLC analysis of carotenoids and retinoids formed in E. coli.

ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cloned cDNA encodes a β-carotene dioxygenase, and correspondingly, it was named β-diox. Since exclusively retinoids, i.e. C20compounds, were found in the E. coli test system, it must be supposed that a centric cleavage of β-carotene is catalyzed, resulting in the formation of two molecules of retinal.For further analysis of the enzymatic properties of β-diox, the cDNA was cloned in the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 and was expressed as a fusion protein. To exclude that the N-terminal fusion to the glutathione S-transferase abolishes the enzymatic activity, the construct (β-diox-gex) was transformed into the β-carotene-synthesizing E. coli strain. Using the test described above, it could be shown that retinoids were formed inE. coli test system (data not shown). After expression of β-diox-gex in E. coli, the protein was subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. The purification could be achieved without the addition of detergents, demonstrating that the fusion protein was soluble and not tightly associated to membranes. To test for enzymatic activity in vitro, one μg of the purified protein was incubated for 2 h in the presence of β-carotene in an assay containing 0.05% Triton X-100. The reaction was stopped by the addition of hydroxylamine/methanol, and the products were analyzed by HPLC after extraction (Fig. 5). For quantification of the molar amounts of the products formed, the peak integrals were normalized to defined amounts of reference substances. The analyses revealed the formation of retinal (73 pmol of retinal from 400 pmol of β-carotene) by the purified enzyme (Fig. 5 b). The addition of FeSO4/ascorbate to the assay led to an increase in the formation of the cleavage product (130 pmol of retinal from 400 pmol of β-carotene), whereas the conversion of β-carotene to retinal could be inhibited by the addition of EDTA (Fig. 5,a and c, respectively). These results indicate that the enzymatic activity of the dioxygenase depends on iron, as has been reported for several in vitro systems of animal origin (9.Krinsky N.I. Wang X. Tang D.G. Russel R.M. Livrea M.A. Vidali G. Retinoids: From Basic Science to Clinical Applications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 21-28Google Scholar). Retinal formation from β-carotene was proportional to the incubation time (up to 2 h). In the presence of FeSO4/ascorbate using varying amounts of substrate (800 pmol to 100 pmol), the apparent K m value for β-carotene was estimated to be 5 μm. Taken together, the enzymatic activity of β-diox characterized so far in the E. coli system in vivo could also be measured in vitro with the purified protein and led to the formation of the identical product.Figure 5Enzymatic activity of the β-diox-gex fusion protein under different conditions. The fusion protein β-diox-gex (approximately 1 μg) was incubated under different conditions in buffer containing 50 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 7.6) and 100 mm NaCl. To start the reaction, 5 μl of β-carotene (80 μm) dissolved in ethanol was added. After 2 h at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped and extracted.

Since the visual chromophore ofDrosophila is 3-hydroxy-retinal, we tested whether β-diox was able to use zeaxhantin as a substrate to directly form hydroxylated retinoids. However, under the conditions in which we applied, the enzyme failed to catalyze this reaction. In addition, we expressed β-diox in a zeaxhantin-accumulating E. coli strain, but only the formation of nonhydroxylated retinoids could be detected. In this E. coli strain, also significant amounts of β-carotene, the direct precursor of zeaxhantin, were found that can serve as a substrate for β-diox. Although flies use 3-hydroxyretinals for vision, it has been shown that, besides 3-hydroxycarotenoids (zeaxhantin and lutein), β-carotene can serve as suitable precursor (18.Vogt K. Z. Naturforsch. 1983; 38: 329-333Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19.Vogt K. Kirschfeld K. Naturwissenschaften. 1984; 71: 211-213Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that flies are able to hydroxylate retinal at position 3 of the β-ionone ring (20.Hardie R. Vogt K. Rudolph A. J. Insect Physiol. 1989; 35: 423-431Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21.Seki T. Isono K. Ozaki K. Tsukahara Y. Shibata-Katsuta Y. Ito M. Irie T. Katagiri M. Eur. J.

Physiol. 1998; 119: 53-64Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test whether epoxy carotenoids were cleaved, enzymatic assays were performed with 9-cis-neoxanthin (neoxanthin was a gift from P. Beyer, University of Freiburg, and was isolated from natural sources), the substrate of the plant dioxygenase vp14. However, under the conditions applied, no cleavage products of these carotenoids could be detected.The sequence analyses revealed that the cDNA encoded a protein of 620 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 69.9 kDa (Fig.6). The deduced amino acid sequence shares sequence homology to the plant carotenoid dioxygenase vp14, to lignostilbene synthase from Pseudomonas paucimobilis, and to several proteins of unknown function in the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis. The highest sequence homology, however, was found to RPE65, a protein from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in vertebrates, first described in bovine eyes (15.Hamel C.P. Tsilou E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20540-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPE65 and β-diox exhibit 36.7% overall sequence identity. The alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of β-diox, RPE65, and vp14 performed with the program Map (17.Huang X. Bioscience. 1994; 10: 227-235Google Scholar) showed a distinct pattern of conserved regions (Fig. 7). Compared with RPE65 and vp14, the insect protein possesses a long extension close to the C terminus. The N-terminal extension of the plant protein vp14 relative to its animal homologues is most probably due to a target sequence for plastid import. The sequence homologies of β-diox with bacterial and plant dioxygenases suggest that we are dealing with a new class of dioxygenases present in bacteria, plants, and animals.Figure 6cDNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of β-diox from D. melanogaster.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences.

It may provide the key to opening up a broad field for further investigation of vitamin A metabolism in animals. The β-diox cDNA encodes a protein of 620 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 69.9 kDa. Enzymatic activity of β-diox could be measured in β-carotene-synthesizingE. coli as well as with the purified recombinant protein.Experiments dealing with the kinetic characteristics of a purified β-carotene dioxygenase have not been published to date. The reaction velocity measured with the purified β-diox fusion protein were relatively low. However, the in vitro test system we used was quite artificial and may miss several components present in crude extracts that could contribute to higher efficiencies. In addition, it is possible that only a small fraction of the purified recombinant enzyme is enzymatically active or that the fusion part of the protein exerts a negative effect. In animals, it has been reported that β-carotene dioxygenase activity depends on iron (9.Krinsky N.I. Wang X. Tang D.G. Russel R.M. Livrea M.A. Vidali G. Retinoids: From Basic Science to Clinical Applications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 21-28Google Scholar). The addition of FeSO4/ascorbat to the assay led to an increase of the enzymatic activity, whereas the addition of EDTA decreased the formation of retinal significantly. Enzymatic activity could be measured without the addition of cofactors such as thiol reagents or electron acceptors. This indicates that β-diox depends mainly on Fe2+ and that other cofactors are not strictly required for enzymatic activity. Since β-carotene is not soluble in an aqueous environment, tests for enzymatic activity were carried out in the presence of Triton X-100. In vivo β-carotene is not freely diffusible and must be associated with lipophilic structures such as membranes or binding proteins. Therefore, the question arose whether β-diox is associated to membranes in order to interact with its lipophilic substrate. The β-diox fusion protein could be purified without the addition of detergents, and this points to its soluble state rather than to its membrane-bound topology. However, the glutathione S-transferase part of the fusion protein may contribute to its solubility, and therefore, this point needs further investigation. Taken together, we could show that β-diox catalyzes the cleavage of β-carotene, but the precise enzymatic mechanism and cofactor requirement and whether membranes or binding proteins are necessary for the delivery of the substrate have to be further investigated.The β-diox gene is located at position 87F on chromosome 3 in theDrosophila genome. Precisely in this region aDrosophila mutant, ninaB, has been mapped by cytological methods (FlyBase Map section 87). The mutant phenotype has a reduced rhodopsin content in all photoreceptor classes. However, the mutant phenotype can be rescued by the dietary supplementation of retinal but not by even high doses of β-carotene. (24.Pak W.L. Breakfield X.O. Neurogenetics: Genetic Approaches to the Nervous System. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1970: 67-99Google Scholar, 25.Stephenson R.S. O'Tousa J. Scavarda N.J. Randall L.L. Pak W.L. Cosens D.J. Vince-Price D. The Biology of Photoreception. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1983: 477-501Google Scholar). Both, the availability of the visual pigment chromophores as well as the transcriptional regulation by retinoic acid of the protein moiety (opsin) of the visual pigment (26.Picking W.L. Chen D. Lee R.D. Vogt M.E. Pollizi J.L. Marietta R.G. Stark W.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) depend on β-diox enzymatic activity. Thus, it seems to be likely that the ninaBphenotype is caused by a mutation in β-diox.The sequence comparison revealed that β-diox belongs to a new class of dioxygenases so far described only in bacteria and plants. The highest sequence homology of β-diox is found to RPE65, a protein first described in bovine eyes. Therefore the question arises whether RPE65 is the vertebrate equivalent to β-diox. Although the exact function of RPE65 is not yet known, a role in vitamin A metabolism has been proposed, and recently it was found that mutations in the gene are responsible for a severe form of early onset retinal dystrophy in humans (27.Gu S.M. Thompson D.A. Srikumari C.R. Lorenz B. Finckh U. Nicoletti A. Murthy K.R. Rathmann M. Kumaramanickavel G. Denton M.J. Gal A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 28.Marlhens F. Bareil C. Griffoin J.M. Zrenner E. Amalric P. Eliaou C. Liu S.Y. Harris E. Redmond T.M. Arnaud B. Claustres M. Hamel C.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In the eyes of mice, where the RPE65 gene has been disrupted, all-trans vitamin A accumulates (29.Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been concluded that RPE65 takes part in the isomerization of all-trans to 11-cis vitamin A in the mammalian visual cycle. However, after removal of RPE65 from RPE membrane fractions, the isomerization of all-trans-retinol into 11-cis-retinol remained unaffected (30.Choo D.W. Cheung E. Rando R.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To our knowledge a β-carotene dioxygenase activity has never been reported in the RPE, nor have significant amounts of its substrate β-carotene been measured in vertebrate eyes. We cloned RPE65 by RT-PCR from the bovine RPE and expressed it in the E. coli test system. But neither the formation of retinoids nor the formation of eccentric cleavage products such as apocarotenals could be detected (data not shown). Therefore, the exact function of RPE65 remains to be further investigated, and we propose that other as yet undiscovered members of this family with different tissue specificity (small intestine, liver) are responsible for the vertebrate β-carotene dioxygenase activity. The sequence homology of β-diox with RPE65 as well as with plant and bacterial dioxygenases suggests that β-diox belongs to a new class of dioxygenases catalyzing the cleavage of a conjugated carbon double bond. The described E. coli test system by which β-diox could be molecularly identified may be a powerful tool to characterize new genes involved in retinoid formation. Furthermore, the retinoid producing E. coli strain can be used to identify further steps in vitamin A metabolism.In recent years there has been a tremendous increase in our understanding of retinoid receptors and their ligands as well as their diverse roles in development and cell differentiation. With our present findings, tissue-specific expression, the impact of the cleavage reaction on the isomeric specificity of retinoids, and the regulation of the vitamin A uptake may soon be further elucidated. Animals are, in general, unable to synthesize vitamin A de novo. Vitamin A (retinol) and its derivatives (retinal, retinoic acid) are C20 isoprenoids metabolically derived from the oxidative cleavage of C40 carotenoids (Fig.1). Most effects of vitamin A are exerted by retinoic acid (1.Dowling J.E. Wald G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 587-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Chytil F. Livrea M.A. Vidali G. Retinoids: From Basic Science to Clinical Applications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 11-19Google Scholar). In the visual system, retinal or closely related compounds such as 3-hydroxyretinal serve as chromophores for the various visual pigments (rhodopsins) (3.Wald G.

https://openalex.org/W2044995190,"Trp1 has been proposed as a component of the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOC) channel. However, neither the molecular mechanism of SOC nor the role of Trp in this process is yet understood. We have examined possible molecular interactions involved in the regulation of SOC and Trp1 and report here for the first time that Trp1 is assembled in signaling complex associated with caveolin-scaffolding lipid raft domains. Endogenous hTrp1 and caveolin-1 were present in low density fractions of Triton X-100-extracted human submandibular gland cell membranes. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol increased Triton X-100 solubility of Trp1 and inhibited carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. Importantly, thapsigargin stimulated Ca2+ influx, but not internal Ca2+ release, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-stimulated I soc were also attenuated. Furthermore, both anti-Trp1 and anti-caveolin-1 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated hTrp1, caveolin-1, Gαq/11, and IP3 receptor-type 3 (IP3R3). These results demonstrate that caveolar microdomains provide a scaffold for (i) assembly of key Ca2+ signaling proteins into a complex and (ii) coordination of the molecular interactions leading to the activation of SOC. Importantly, we have shown that Trp1 is also localized in this microdomain where it interacts with one or more components of this complex, including IP3R3. This finding is potentially important in elucidating the physiological function of Trp. Trp1 has been proposed as a component of the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOC) channel. However, neither the molecular mechanism of SOC nor the role of Trp in this process is yet understood. We have examined possible molecular interactions involved in the regulation of SOC and Trp1 and report here for the first time that Trp1 is assembled in signaling complex associated with caveolin-scaffolding lipid raft domains. Endogenous hTrp1 and caveolin-1 were present in low density fractions of Triton X-100-extracted human submandibular gland cell membranes. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol increased Triton X-100 solubility of Trp1 and inhibited carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. Importantly, thapsigargin stimulated Ca2+ influx, but not internal Ca2+ release, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-stimulated I soc were also attenuated. Furthermore, both anti-Trp1 and anti-caveolin-1 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated hTrp1, caveolin-1, Gαq/11, and IP3 receptor-type 3 (IP3R3). These results demonstrate that caveolar microdomains provide a scaffold for (i) assembly of key Ca2+ signaling proteins into a complex and (ii) coordination of the molecular interactions leading to the activation of SOC. Importantly, we have shown that Trp1 is also localized in this microdomain where it interacts with one or more components of this complex, including IP3R3. This finding is potentially important in elucidating the physiological function of Trp. store-operated Ca2+ influx lipid raft domain transient receptor potential protein phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate store-operated inward current methyl-β-cyclodextrin inositol trisphosphate receptor human submandibular gland cells 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,2-bis(O-aminophenyxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid intracellular [Ca2+] Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOC),1 present in all non-excitable cells, is activated via an as yet unknown mechanism when internal Ca2+ stores are depleted. Following neurotransmitter stimulation of cells, SOC is activated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent release of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ stores via the IP3 receptor (IP3R). However, SOC is also activated by store depletion in the absence of any increase in IP3. The nature of the signal which links the internal Ca2+ store to the plasma membrane, and the molecule that mediates Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, is not yet known in any non-excitable cell type (1.Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 2.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Several, mammalian homologues of the Drosophila trp gene have been proposed as candidate genes encoding the SOC channel protein (1.Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 3.Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar), although the exact physiological role of trp gene products remains to be clarified. Important questions that need to be addressed are (i) whether Trp proteins form the SOC channel and if they do, is the channel a homomer or multimer of one or more Trp protein(s), and (ii) whether SOC regulation is more complex, involving Trp interactions with other scaffolding or regulatory proteins. TheDrosophila Trp (dTrp) has been shown to be assembled in a signaling complex, binding directly to the scaffolding protein (INAD) and calmodulin and indirectly to phospholipase Cβ and rhodopsin via INAD. Protein kinase C, Trp-like channel, and G-protein subunits (Gαq, β, and γ) are also associated with this complex. It has been suggested that protein-protein interactions within the complex, localized in the photoreceptor membrane, facilitate key reactions in the signaling cascade and lead to Trp activation (4.Chevisch J. Zreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 5.Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.

A mammalian homologue of the Drosophila inaD has been recently cloned (7.Phillip C. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although presently there are no data to suggest that the mammalian Trp protein(s), like dTrp, is assembled in a larger signaling complex where it is associated with regulatory or scaffolding proteins. We have recently proposed that Trp1 is a strong candidate for the SOC mechanism in salivary epithelial cells (8.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrated that the endogenous Trp1 was localized in the plasma membrane of these cells and could be correlated with SOC. We showed that a decrease in endogenous Trp1 was associated with a decrease in SOC while an increase in Trp1, following stable transfection of the cells withhtrp1 cDNA, induced an increase in SOC. However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the Trp1-SOC association is not yet clear. For example, it remains to be established whether Trp1, either by itself or in association with other proteins, constitutes the SOC channel. Recent studies reported by Muallem and co-workers (9.Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) have shown that hTrp3 is a Ca2+ channel that is activated by internal Ca2+ store depletion (9.Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these investigators have shown that Trp3 is activated via binding to the N-terminal domain of the IP3R (10.Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the conformational coupling hypothesis (1.Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) according to which SOC is regulated via an interaction with IP3R which acts as the “sensor” of the status of the internal Ca2+store(s). In addition to this Trp-IP3R interaction, Trp proteins have also been proposed to be regulated via association either as homomers, or heteromers with other Trps, to form the SOC channel (3.Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that govern the interactions between the various Trp proteins or between Trp and other proteins. Also unclear is how such interactions result in the activation, or inactivation, of the putative Trp channels or SOC. Functionally distinct microdomains, formed by the lateral packing of glycosphingolipids and cholesterol within the membrane bilayer, have been identified in plasma membranes (11.Harder T. Simons K. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). These domains, called lipid raft domains (LRD), are characterized by their insolubility in nonionic detergents under certain conditions, e.g. 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. LRD have been proposed to be involved in the sorting of proteins in the Golgi and their delivery to the plasma membrane (12.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). LRD have also been implicated in cellular signaling mechanisms, where they have been proposed to serve as scaffolds to facilitate the association of signaling complexes, increase the rate of interactions, and enhance crosstalk networks (13.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Among the various signaling proteins known to be associated with raft domains are G-protein α subunits (14.Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), Src family tyrosine kinases (15.Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and eNOS (16.Garcia-Cardena G. Martasek P. Siler Masters B.S. Skidd P.M. Couet J. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25437-25440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Furthermore, key protein and non-protein molecules involved in the Ca2+ signaling cascade, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) (17.Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), Gαq/11 (18.de Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), muscarinic receptor (19.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ signaling events such as the turnover of PIP2 have been localized to such microdomains in the plasma membrane (20.Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Notably, Ca2+signaling mediated via bradykinin receptor stimulation (18.de Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) was altered when LRD was disrupted by cholesterol depletion. In aggregate, these previous reports suggest that the integrity of the LRD is a critical element in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling. Plasma membrane domains, called caveolae, have also been shown to play a crucial role in signal transduction mechanisms (13.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). It has now been shown that caveolae are formed through a coalescence of LRDs. Caveolin-1, a cholesterol-binding protein which is enriched in LRD, has been proposed to be a scaffolding protein involved in the recruitment/association of specific proteins into LRD (13.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Notably, a number of proteins, that are known to be present in LRD, have one or more binding sites for caveolin. Thus, arrangement of the lipids and scaffolding proteins within LRD forms a platform for the coordination of cellular signaling events. To elucidate the role of Trp1 in SOC, we have investigated possible molecular interactions involved in the regulation of endogenous hTrp1 and SOC in human submandibular gland cells, HSG. These cells provide a well characterized experimental system to study the regulation of SOC (8.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The data presented below demonstrate for the first time that hTrp1 is localized in a caveolin-scaffolding LRD in the plasma membrane where it interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a complex of Ca2+ signaling proteins, such as IP3R and Gαq/11. Furthermore, the integrity of the LRD appeared to be critical for the regulation of SOC and for the association of Trp1 with LRD. Thus, this study reveals that the molecular architecture of the LRD is likely to be important in determining the localization and regulation of Trp1 and the SOC mechanism. HSG cells were cultured as described earlier (8.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HSG cells were stably transfected withhtrp1 cDNA as described earlier (8.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cells were detached, suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) aprotinin (Sigma), centrifuged for 5 min at 900 ×g, and resuspended in a lysis buffer containing (in mm): 100 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 MgCl2, 0.5 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH), 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and frozen at −80 °C for at least 2 h before use. HSG cell lysates (3–5 ml) were thawed on ice, homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and diluted into sucrose buffer consisting of (final concentration): 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% aprotinin (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol (Calbiochem, Ultrol grade). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the resultant supernatant centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of the sucrose buffer and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay (microassay procedure). Crude membranes were solubilized essentially using a modified method described by Skibbens et al. (23.Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 1 mg of crude membranes (2 mg/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 4 or 37 °C, in a medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA with either 1.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (w/v) or 1% Triton X-100 (v/v). 1 m KI was added where indicated to disrupt possible interactions with cytoskeletal proteins (24.Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D. Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 145,000 ×g. The pellets (resuspended in the same buffer as above with the detergent) and supernatant were stored at −80 °C until use Samples were diluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 5 mmEDTA, and 1% SDS. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (25.Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Conditions for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were as described previously (26.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim B. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked and incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 dilution of the primary antibodies (as indicated in the figure legends). The membrane was washed with TTBS, incubated as required with either anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG, washed, treated with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to X-OmatTM films (Kodak). Confluent HSG cells were treated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) for 30 min at 37 °C as described (27.Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 28.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with 20 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1% (v/v) aprotinin and harvested in ice-cold extraction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 s and the combined pellets were resuspended at room temperature in a minimal volume of a solubilization buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 5 mmEDTA, and 1% SDS. The supernatants were concentrated using Centriprep (Amicon Corp.) concentrators. Protein concentration was determined according to Schaffner and Weissmann (25.Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Flotation gradients were performed as described in Scheiffele et al. (29.Scheiffele P. Rietveld A. Wilk T. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2038-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 250 μg of HSG crude membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 60,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 250 μl of extraction medium containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 m KI, and incubated for 20 min at either 4 or 37 °C as indicated in figure legends. In some experiments, 1.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (w/v) was included in the buffer instead of Triton X-100. Cells were lysed and crude membrane was prepared as described above. Membranes were treated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and the solubilized fraction was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 60 min and precleared by incubation with an excess of the protein A beads and centrifugation. 200 μl of the cleared sample was incubated either with 5 μg of monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or 10 μg of polyclonal anti-Trp1 (26.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim B. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were pulled down with 30 μl of 30% protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with buffer containing 500 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vandate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% sucrose, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupetin, and pepstatin and treated with SDS solubilization buffer. Proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The following primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution: anti-Trp1, anti-caveolin-1, anti-IP3R3, and anti-calmodulin (Transduction Laboratories), and anti-Gαq/11 (Upstate Biologicals). The secondary antibodies and conditions for the ECL reaction were as described above. Fura2 fluorescence in single cells was measured as described earlier (8.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P.

Images were acquired using an enhanced CCD camera (CCD-72, MTI) and the Image-1 software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Analog plots of the fluorescence ratio (340/380) in single cells are shown. The store-operated inward Ca2+ current (I SOC) was measured using the whole cell patch clamp technique as described before (22.Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The external solution contained 135 mm sodium glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (NaOH). The pipette solution contained 135 mm N-methyl-d-glutamate, 10 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) (CsOH), and 10 mm BAPTA. When required, 10 μm IP3 was included in the pipette solution. Membrane potential was maintained at 0 mV. Within the time frame of these experiments, no inward currents were activated in the absence of IP3. Other details are mentioned in the figure legends and text. Fig.1 A shows that when HSG cell membranes were extracted with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C, the endogenous Trp1 (hTrp1) remained associated with the insoluble pellet (P, lane 2) and was not detected in the solubilizate (S, lane 1). Endogenous Trp1 was detected using the Trp1-specific polyclonal antibody we have described previously (8.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T.P. Jadlowiec J. O' Connell B.C. Wellner R.B. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 26.Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim B. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since cytoskeletal components of the cell are also resistant to Triton X-100, cell membranes were treated with Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 m KI, which is known to disrupt protein-cytoskeletal interactions (24.Campbell K.P. Kahl S.D. Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Lane 3 shows that in the presence of KI, relatively more hTrp1 was extracted into the solubilizate (S) and less was left in the insoluble pellet (P, lane 4). When membranes were treated with Triton X-100 alone at 37 °C (right panel, Fig. 1 A), again hTrp1 was not solubilized (seelanes 1 and 2). However, when KI was included in the solubilization medium the protein was almost completely solubilized (see lanes 3 and 4). These results are consistent with the association of Trp1 in a detergent-resistant membrane fraction. Furthermore, the increased solubility of hTrp1 when KI was included during solubilization suggests that it interacts with cytoskeletal proteins. However, the insolubility in Triton X-100 + KI at 4 °C suggests that part of the total Trp1 protein is associated with LRD. LRD have been shown to be more effectively solubilized by octylglucoside (30.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Thus, to further demonstrate the association of hTrp1 with LRD, HSG cell membranes were treated with 1.5% (w/v) octylglucoside at 4 °C. hTrp1 was not solubilized (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 3) unless KI was included during solubilization, which resulted in complete solubilization of hTrp1 by the detergent, even at 4 °C (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and4). In aggregate, these data show that the fraction of Trp1 that is insoluble in Triton X-100 + KI at 4 °C can be solubilized by octyglucoside and thus is associated with LRD. Proteins interacting with lipid raft domains have been shown to associate with low density fractions of Triton X-100-extracted cell membranes, while solubilized proteins and those linked to the cytoskeleton are recovered in the high density fractions (30.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). The differential density of proteins following treatment with 1% Trition X-100 at 4 °C versus 37 °C, is another criterion used to determine their association with lipid raft domains. When HSG cell membranes were treated with Triton X-100 + KI at 4 °C (Fig. 2 A), hTrp1 was detected in both the low and high density fractions. This result is consistent with the data in Fig. 1 showing that Trp1 is only partially solubilized by treatment with Triton X-100 + KI at 4 °C. Importantly, following treatment with Triton X-100 at 37 °C, hTrp1 was enriched in the heaviest fraction (number 6, Fig.2 B). This again is consistent with the data in Fig. 1showing that almost all of the Trp1 was solubilized under these conditions. A similar pattern was obtained when membranes were treated with Triton X-100 at 37 °C in the absence of KI (data not shown). Together with the insolubility of hTrp1 in Triton X-100 at 37 °C (Fig. 1 A), these data suggest that (i) a fraction of Trp1 is associated with LRD, and (ii) Trp1 also interacts with the cytoskeleton. Notably, when membranes were treated with octylglucoside at 4 °C in the presence of KI, hTrp1 is completely recovered in the high density fractions (Fig. 2 C). These results are consistent with the data in Fig. 1 B and suggest that lipid raft-associated hTrp1 is solubilized by octylglucoside. Thus, in aggregate the data in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that the detergent insolubility of hTrp1 is due to its interactions with both LRD and with cytoskeletal or other protein components in the plasma membrane. As mentioned above caveolin-1 is a cholesterol-binding scaffolding protein known to be present in LDR. Thus, the presence of caveolin-1 is used to identify LRD membrane fractions. We examined the presence of caveolin-1 in the fractions described above for hTrp1. In the data shown in Fig. 2 D, the lower portion of the same membrane used for hTrp1 was used to probe for caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 was also detected in the low density fractions following treatment of membranes with Triton X-100 at 4 °C and high density fractions after treatment with Triton X-100 at 37 °C (data not shown). These data provide further evidence for the association of hTrp1 with caveolin-enriched lipid raft domains. It is well established that cholesterol is required for the formation and structural integrity of LRD (11.Harder T. Simons K. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 12.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of membrane cholesterol has been shown to alter the association and function of proteins in this domain. HSG cells were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, CD, an agent reported to deplete plasma membrane cholesterol (31.Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows that more Trp1 protein was obtained in the Triton X-100 extract of CD-treated cells (lane 1) than control, untreated, cells (lane 2). These data convincingly demonstrate that hTrp1 is associated with cholesterol-sphingolipid raft domains in the plasma membrane of HSG cells. The involvement of lipid raft domains in HSG cell Ca2+signaling was assessed by examining carbachol-stimulated [Ca2+]i mobilization in control and CD-treated HSG cells. [Ca2+]i mobilization was determined by stimulating the cells with carbachol (100 μm) in the presence or absence of external Ca2+. In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ in the external medium, control HSG cells display a typical response (21.Liu X. Singh B.B. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

The initial rise in [Ca2+]i is a result of IP3-dependent internal Ca2+release, as it is also detected in cells in the absence of external Ca2+, i.e. in a nominally Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 4 D). The sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, which is due to the influx of extracellular Ca2+, is not detected in the absence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 4 D) or in the presence of inhibitors of Ca2+ influx (data not shown). Carbachol-stimulated [Ca2+]i elevation was completely blocked in CD-treated HSG cells in a Ca2+-containing medium (compare Fig. 4, A andB, average data shown in 4C). [Ca2+]i in CD-treated cells after stimulation with carbachol was not different from resting [Ca2+]i. Additionally, resting [Ca2+]i was not affected by the CD treatment. More importantly, the loss of [Ca2+]i increase was also seen when CD-treated cells were stimulated with carbachol in a Ca"

Results confirm that the heme is covalently attached to the protein via two ester linkages between the carboxyl groups of Glu242 and Asp94 and modified methyl groups on pyrrole rings A and C of the heme as well as a sulfonium ion linkage between the sulfur atom of Met243and the β-carbon of the vinyl group on pyrrole ring A. In the native enzyme a bound chloride ion has been identified at the amino terminus of the helix containing the proximal His336. Determination of the x-ray crystal structure of a myeloperoxidase-bromide complex (r = 0.243, free r = 0.296) has shown that this chloride ion can be replaced by bromide. Bromide is also seen to bind, at partial occupancy, in the distal heme cavity, in close proximity to the distal His95, where it replaces the water molecule hydrogen bonded to Gln91. The bromide-binding site in the distal cavity appears to be the halide-binding site responsible for shifts in the Soret band of the absorption spectrum of myeloperoxidase. It is proposed that halide binding to this site inhibits the enzyme by effectively competing with H2O2 for access to the distal histidine, whereas in compound I, the same site may be the halide substrate-binding site.

H2O2+Cl−+H3O+=HOCl+2H2O REACTION 1Products of these reactions and their secondary metabolites are responsible for killing phagocytized bacteria and viruses (5.Klebanoff S.J.

MPO is one member of a gene family of mammalian peroxidases that also includes eosinophil peroxidase, lactoperoxidase (LPO), thyroid peroxidase, and prostaglandin H synthase (7.Merlie J.P. Fagan D. Mudd J. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3550-3553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kimura S. Ikeda-Saito M. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Biochem. 1991; 198: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The mature enzyme is a 140-kDa dimer of identical halves, each consisting of two polypeptide chains of 108 and 466 amino acids resulting from post-translational excision of 6 amino acids from a single polypeptide precursor (10.Koeffler H.P. Ranyard J. Pertcheck M. Blood. 1985; 65: 484-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Akin D.T. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8370-8375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each half molecule contains a covalently bound heme that exhibits unusual spectral properties. The Soret band at 428 nm in the ferric enzyme is considerably red-shifted compared with other heme proteins, and relatively strong absorption bands in the visible region are responsible for the characteristic green color of the enzyme (12.Wever R. Plat H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Selective cleavage of a single disulfide bridge linking the two halves of MPO yields the hemi-enzyme that exhibits spectral and catalytic properties indistinguishable from those of the intact enzyme (13.Andrews P.C. Krinsky N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4211-4218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall protein fold of MPO was first revealed by a 3-Å resolution crystal structure of the canine enzyme (14.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Apparently identical halves of the dimeric molecule are related by a noncrystallographic dyad axis and covalently linked by a single disulfide bridge at Cys153. The secondary structure is largely α-helical, with very little β-sheet. Each half molecule consists of a central core of five helices and a covalently attached heme. Four of these helices derive from the large polypeptide and the fifth from the small. The remainder of the large polypeptide folds into four separate domains and a single open loop that surround the central core. The small polypeptide wraps around the surface of the molecule with only its carboxyl-terminal helix penetrating the interior to form part of the central core. A very similar protein fold has been found for the catalytic domain of the membrane-bound enzyme prostaglandin H synthase, which shares 22% sequence identity with MPO (15.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Structure determination has confirmed the presence of a calcium-binding site and three sites of asparagine-linked glycosylation (Asn189, Asn225, and Asn317) as well as the identities of the proximal His336 and distal His95. However, the relatively low resolution (3 Å) did not allow full characterization of the covalent linkages between the heme and the protein. Details of these interactions and full characterization of the heme were later established by a 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure of the human enzyme (16.Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The heme was identified as a derivative of protoporphyrin IX in which the methyl groups on pyrrole rings A and C had been modified to allow formation of ester linkages with Glu242 and Asp94, respectively. A third covalent link was identified as a sulfonium ion linkage between the sulfur atom of Met243 and the terminal β-carbon of the vinyl group on pyrrole ring A. Presence of the latter has been confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the heme released by autolytic cleavage and protease digestion (17.Taylor K.L. Strobel F. Yue K.T. Ram P. Pohl J. Woods A.S. Kinkade Jr., J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction between heme-peroxidases and hydrogen peroxide results in the formation of compound I, in which two oxidizing equivalents are stored as an oxyferryl Fe IV π-cation radical (18.Dolphin D. Forman A. Borg D.C. Felton R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In the case of MPO, this oxidized form of the enzyme is capable of either two-electron peroxidation of halide ions and thiocyanate or single-electron oxidation of a wide variety of aromatic alcohols and amines. The mechanism by which MPO catalyzes halide peroxidation is complex, because both H2O2 and halide are also inhibitors. Halide inhibition is competitive with respect to H2O2, and at any given pH there is an optimal ratio of the concentrations of halide: H2O2consistent with maximal reaction velocity (19.Stelmaszynska T. Zgliczynski J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 45: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20.Zgliczynski J.M. Selvaraj R.J. Paul B.B. Stelmaszynska T. Poskitt P.K.F. Sbarra A.J. Proc. Exp. Biol.

The reaction of H2O2 with MPO to form compound I is pH-dependent. A group on the enzyme with a pK of 4.0 to 4.3, presumed to be the distal histidine, must be deprotonated for H2O2 binding to occur; whereas conversely, halide binding is favored at low pH when this group is protonated (23.Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,24.Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4344-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Spectral changes accompany the binding of halides to MPO. Fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide induce red-shifts of the Soret maximum from 428 nm to 435, 434, 432, and 423 nm, respectively, and measurements of these spectral changes have been used to determine the pH dependence of halide binding to the enzyme (19.Stelmaszynska T. Zgliczynski J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 45: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23.Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, these studies have arrived at differing conclusions concerning the number of halide-binding sites on the enzyme and whether there are separate sites for halide binding as a substrate and as an inhibitor. In this paper we present additional detailed information on the active site region of MPO as revealed by a structure determination of the human enzyme to 1.8 Å resolution, using x-ray diffraction data recorded at −180 °C. In addition, structure determination of an MPO-bromide complex has revealed a number of halide-binding sites, and their possible relevance to the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme is discussed. Crystals of human MPO isoform C were grown by a method similar to those reported previously (25.Sutton B.J. Little C. Olsen R.L. Willassen N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 395-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26.Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10967-10973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hanging droplets containing 20 mg/ml MPO, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm calcium chloride, and 6% (w/v) PEG 8k were equilibrated with reservoirs containing the same concentrations of the above salts but with 22 to 25% w/v PEG 8k at 65 °F. Crystals were transferred to protein-free substitute mother liquor containing the above salts and 16% w/v PEG 8k for crystallographic experiments. For low temperature data collection, 20% (w/v) 2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol was included as cryoprotectant. X-ray diffraction data were recorded using a 30-cm MAR image plate detector (MAR Research, Hamburg, Germany) mounted on a Rigaku RU300 x-ray generator equipped with long focusing mirrors (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). A native low temperature (−180 °C) diffraction data set to 1.8 Å resolution was recorded from a single crystal, flash-frozen in a stream of cold nitrogen from a crystal cooling device (Area Detector Systems Corp.). The crystal to detector distance was set at 115 mm, and 231 frames of data were recorded at 1° rotation intervals. Image processing and data scaling were performed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (27.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P21 with a single dimeric molecule of MPO as the asymmetric unit. Unit cell parameters from the frozen crystal were: a = 110.0 Å, b = 63.4 Å, c = 92.2 Å, β = 97.4°, compared with values of a = 111.7 Å, b = 64.6 Å,c = 94.2 Å, β = 97.9° at room temperature (16.Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating significant shrinkage of the unit cell at cryogenic temperature.

Zeng J. Davey C. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This model consists of 9424 nonhydrogen protein atoms and 423 water molecules. The crystallographic R-factor was 15.0% for 55,500 reflections (93% completion) in the resolution range 6.0 to 2.28 Å, with root mean square deviations from ideality for bond lengths and angles of 0.013 Å and 3.01o. Refinement using the 1.8 Å resolution low temperature data set was carried out using X-PLOR version 3.8 (28.Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and stereochemical parameters derived from Engh and Huber (29.Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Cycles of simulated annealing, conjugate-gradient energy minimization, and isotropic temperature factor refinement were performed between stages of model rebuilding using 2F o − F c andF o − F c maps in conjunction with the molecular modeling program TURBO (Bio-Graphics Inc., Marseille, France). The highest resolution of x-ray data included in the refinement was increased stepwise from 2.25 Å to 2.0, 1.85, and 1.8 Å. A subset comprising 5% of the reflections was not used in refinement to allow for calculation of a free R-factor (30.Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Additional water molecules were included in the model when observed as spherical peaks at a level of at least 4 ς in Fo-Fc difference maps, provided that suitable hydrogen bonding partners were already present in the model. Water molecules that failed to reappear at 2 ς in 2F o − F c maps following a round of refinement were removed from the model. Because of an ambiguity in the hydrogen bonding pattern for water molecules in the distal heme cavity in the 2.3 Å resolution structure of human MPO, all water molecules in the distal cavity were specifically excluded from the model until the late stages of refinement when their positions could be clearly determined from F o −F c difference maps. Also, toward the end of refinement, solute ions, including acetate and sulfate were added to the model where indicated by additional difference map density and the presence of suitable protein ligands. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not used during refinement, but a bulk solvent model was included in the final stages and resulted in considerable improvement in the R-factor for data in the lowest resolution shell. The quality of the model was assessed using the program PROCHECK (31.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK V2. Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, England1992Google Scholar). Coordinates for the final model have been deposited with the Rutgers University Protein Data Bank, access code1CXP. A crystal of human MPO was transferred to substitute mother liquor consisting of 16% PEG 8k, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm calcium acetate, and 20 mm sodium bromide. Following equilibration for 48 h. the crystal was washed briefly in the same mother liquor with 20% (v/v) 2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol added as cryoprotectant before flash freezing in a stream of nitrogen at −180 °C. X-ray diffraction data were recorded as described for the native enzyme and scaling statistics are given in Table I. The positions of bound bromide ions were determined from a difference Fourier map using F o (MPO·bromide)− F c (MPO) as coefficients. Subsequently, bromide ions were included in the model, and refinement of the structure was carried out using X-PLOR version 3.8 as described above. Coordinates for the refined model of the MPO-bromide complex have been deposited with the Rutgers University Protein Data Bank under access code 1D2V. The final model consists of 10,307 nonhydrogen atoms, including 1140 amino acids, 2 hemes, 16 sugars, 2 calcium ions, 2 chloride ions, 4 sulfates, 6 acetates, and 838 water molecules. The crystallographicR-factor for reflections in the 30 to 1.8 Å range is 19.7%, and the corresponding free R-factor is 23.9%. The root mean square deviations from ideality for bond lengths and angles are 0.013 Å and 1.23°. A Ramachandran plot for the whole molecule shows 88.8% of residues in the most favored regions and 11% in additionally allowed regions. Ser42 in both halves of the molecule has ϕ,ψ angles in the generously allowed region, and no residues fall in disallowed regions. Although the ϕ,ψ angles for Ser42 lie outside of the additionally allowed region, the orientation of this residue appears to be influenced by hydrogen bonding between the NH and CO groups of both of its adjacent peptide bonds with amino acid side chains. There are threecis-prolines at positions 124, 355, and 558 and acis-peptide bond between Asn549 and Asn550 in each half of the molecule. Stereochemical parameters for both the main chain and side chains were determined to be within, or better than, the ranges given for other protein structures determined at comparable resolution according to the program PROCHECK (31.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK V2. Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, England1992Google Scholar). Because the two halves of the MPO molecule (designated A and B) have different environments in the crystal, there are some differences in the conformations of equivalent side chains on the surface of the molecule. In general, the A half of the molecule is involved in more extensive intermolecular contacts in the crystal, and for this reason is a little better ordered than the B half. This is reflected in the lower average B-factor for protein atoms in the A half (11.1 Å3) compared with the B half (13.1 Å3). The amino acid numbering system used here is based on designating the first Cys in the small polypeptide as residue 1 (14.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the sequence of human MPO, deduced from the cDNA, there are 2 residues (Val and Thr) prior to Cys1 (32.Johnson K.R. Nauseef W.M. Care A. Weelock M.J. Shane S. Hudson S. Koeffler H.P. Selsted M. Miller C. Rovera G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2013-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33.Morishita K. Kubota N. Asano S. Kaziro Y. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3844-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but these are not evident in the electron density map. The backbone density is very well defined for all four polypeptide chains, except for two surface loops involving residues 217–218 and 354–356 in both halves of the molecule. The amino terminus of the small polypeptide (residues 2–6) is poorly ordered in the A half but well ordered in the B half where the side chains of Glu3and Gln4 are involved in hydrogen bonding with residues in a symmetry-related molecule. Conversely, the carboxyl terminus of the large polypeptide (residues 576–578) is poorly ordered in the B half but well defined in the A half where the terminal carboxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the amide nitrogen of Gln75 in a neighboring molecule. A number of side chains on the surface of the molecule (15 in the A half and 23 in the B) exhibit some degree of disorder, although in many cases this is limited to truncated density for the termini of the longer side chains of arginine and lysine. The overall polypeptide fold for human MPO (Fig. 1) is the same as reported previously for the dog enzyme (14.Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and described briefly in the introduction. However, the higher resolution of the current electron density map has allowed more detailed characterization of a number of structural features. The calcium-binding site has typical pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. The Oγ of Ser174 and the peptide carbonyl oxygen of Phe170 provide the axial ligands, whereas the other five ligands (Asp96 carboxyl oxygen and peptide carbonyl oxygen, Thr168 hydroxyl and peptide carbonyl oxygens, and Asp172 carboxyl oxygen) are arranged approximately co-planar. Five of these ligands arise from residues within the 168–174 loop of the large polypeptide, whereas the other two involve Asp96, which is adjacent to the distal His95 in the small polypeptide. The orientations of all of the sugars comprising the Asn317 glycosylation site have been determined. The carbohydrate chain consists of the standard (GlcNac)2-(Man)3 structure with a fucose 1–6 linked to the first GlcNac. Interactions between these sugar chains in the two halves of the molecule make up much of the dimer interface in MPO. Details of the carbohydrate conformation and its interactions with the protein will be presented elsewhere. The heme group is a derivative of protoporphyrin IX in which the methyl groups on pyrrole rings A and C have been modified to allow formation of ester linkages with the carboxyl groups of Glu242 and Asp94, respectively. In addition the β-carbon of the vinyl group on pyrrole ring A forms a covalent bond with the sulfur atom of Met243, giving rise to a sulfonium ion linkage (Fig. 2). The resulting positive charge on the sulfur atom does not appear to be involved in any additional electrostatic interactions with the protein. The heme porphyrin ring is considerably distorted from planarity. Although pyrrole rings B and D are nearly co-planar, ring A and, to a lesser degree, ring C are tilted toward the distal side, resulting in a bow-shaped structure for the heme. Because of these distortions to the porphyrin ring, it is impractical to define the position of the central iron atom with respect to a “heme plane” as is commonly reported for heme-containing proteins. However, the iron is positioned slightly to the proximal side, 0.2 Å below a line connecting the nitrogen atoms of pyrrole rings B and D. The Nε of His336provides the proximal ligand to the iron, with an iron to nitrogen distance of 2.19 Å, whereas the Nδ of this residue is hydrogen bonded to the amide carbonyl oxygen of Asn421. The carboxyl groups of both of the heme propionates also make electrostatic interactions with the protein. The ring D propionate interacts with the guanidinium groups of both Arg333 and Arg424, and also forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. The ring C propionate interacts with both Asp98and Thr100. One of the propionate oxygens forms hydrogen bonds with the Thr100 peptide NH and additionally with a water molecule, whereas the other hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of Asp98. Distances for these interactions and the heme-protein covalent bonds are given in TableII.Table IIHeme-protein interactionsHeme groupResidueBond typeDistanceABÅA methyl CGlu242Oɛcovalent1.551.55A vinyl CβMet243 Scovalent1.631.62C methyl CAsp94 Oδcovalent1.541.55C propionate O1Thr100 OγH-bond2.912.92C propionate O1Asp98OδH-bond2.682.67C propionate O2Thr100 NHH-bond2.812.76C propionate O2Wat846 OHH-bond2.582.81D propionate O1Arg424 NH2H-bond2.942.94D propionate O1Wat798 OHH-bond2.632.70D propionate O2Arg333 NH1H-bond2.842.73D propionate O2Arg424NɛH-bond2.862.85Fe3+His336Nɛligand2.192.19Fe3+Wat1OHligand2.903.00 Open table in a new tab Access to the distal cavity occurs via a narrow oval-shaped opening with a predominantly hydrophobic surface above pyrrole ring D. The pyrrole ring forms the base of the opening, whereas the upper surface consists of the β, γ, and δ carbons of Arg239 and phenylalanines 99, 366, and 407 make contributions to the lateral surfaces of the opening. A funnel-shaped channel filled with water molecules leads from this narrow opening to the surface of the protein. The distal heme cavity is occupied by the side chains of Gln91, His95, and Arg239, together with five water molecules (W1–W5). Each of these three side chains is hydrogen bonded to a different water molecule, whereas a fourth water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the heme pyrrole ring C propionate. Additional hydrogen bonding occurs between these water molecules as indicated in Fig.3. A fifth water molecule (W5) is hydrogen bonded to W2 and possibly also weakly to W3. The distal His95 is hydrogen bonded to W1, which is positioned approximately mid-way between its Nε and the heme iron. Its distance from both the histidine nitrogen and the iron (2.9 Å) suggests that it is hydrogen bonded to the histidine and is not strongly coordinated to the heme iron. The amide nitrogen of Gln91, at the back of the distal cavity, is hydrogen bonded to W2 as well as to the carbonyl oxygen of the ester bond between Glu242 and the heme pyrrole ring A methyl carbon. The amide oxygen of Gln91 is in turn hydrogen bonded to the amide nitrogen of Gln88. The guanidinium group of Arg239 is hydrogen bonded to W3 but additionally forms a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of Asp237 as well as a hydrogen bond with the peptide carbonyl oxygen of Asp98. As shown in Fig. 4, a chain of hydrogen bonds involving 5 buried water molecules and the side chain of His250 extends from the distal histidine to the surface of the molecule, at a point remote from the solvent channel leading to the distal cavity. The Nδ of the distal His95 is hydrogen bonded to a buried water molecule, which is separated from the distal cavity water molecules by the imidazole ring. This water is also hydrogen bonded to Nε of His250, thereby forming a bridge between the two histidines. The Nδ of His250 is hydrogen bonded to a second water molecule, which is the first in a chain of four buried water molecules, linked by hydrogen bonds, and leading to the surface of the protein. Each of the five buried water molecules is additionally hydrogen bonded to an oxygen acceptor. The first is a carboxyl oxygen of Asp237, whereas the other four are all peptide carbonyl oxygens. Toward the end of refinement, the most significant feature seen inF o − F c residual maps was additional positive density (11 ς) at a modeled water molecule hydrogen bonded to the peptide NH groups of Trp32 and Val237 in both halves of the molecule. Because Val237 is close to the amino terminus of an α-helix (residues 326–338), a bound anion in this location could interact with the partial positive charge associated with the helix dipole. Of the anions present in the mother liquor of crystallization (50 mm acetate, 50 mm sulfate, 2 mmchloride) chloride best modeled the observed compact spherical density. When chloride was included in the model at full occupancy and a round of X-PLOR refinement was carried out, residual maps showed no significant positive or negative density at this putative chloride site. The chloride-binding site (Fig. 5) is composed of residues 324–327 at the amino terminus of the helix containing the proximal His336, residues 30–33 of the small polypeptide, and Trp436. These two stretches of polypeptide are in a parallel orientation and held together by two backbone hydrogen bonds. The chloride has three ligands: Trp32 NH, Val327 NH, and water in an almost planar trigonal arrangement. The water molecule is additionally hydrogen bonded to the peptide carbonyl oxygen of Leu33 and the guanidinium group NH of Arg 31. There are two tryptophans in the immediate vicinity of the chloride ion. Trp436 makes the closest approach with its indole ring CH2 at a distance of 3.6 Å from the ion, whereas Trp32 is directed away from the ion with its Cγ 4.8 Å from the chloride. To further characterize the binding properties of this site, an experiment was carried out to determine whether a second halide, bromide, could replace the putative chloride. As described above, x-ray diffraction data were recorded from a crystal soaked in 20 mm bromide at pH 5.5. A difference Fourier map, calculated usingF o (MPO·bromide) −F c (MPO) coefficients revealed four separate bromide ions bound to each half of the molecule. The largest features of the map at 19.1 and 20.3 ς in the two halves of the molecule occur at the putative chloride-binding site (Fig. 5). Refinement indicate"

Expression of FGF-7 was induced in respiratory epithelial cells of the fetal lung by administration of doxycycline to the dam.

In the lung, FGF-7 and the related polypeptide FGF-10 are expressed in mesenchymal cells in distinct temporal and spatial patterns. Fgf-7 expression begins at embryonic day 14.5, being detected throughout the mesenchyme surrounding the developing lung tubules (1.Finch P.W. Cunha G.R. Rubin J.S. Wong J. Ron D. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 2.Mason I.J. Fuller-Pace F. Smith R. Dickson C. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Fgf-10expression is initiated earlier, at the onset of lung organogenesis, and is restricted to the mesenchyme surrounding the distal tips of the branching tubules (3.Bellusci S. Grindley J. Emoto H. Itoh N. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1997; 124: 4867-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-7 and FGF-10 bind with high affinity to the same FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2-IIIb) isoform (4.Igarashi M. Finch P.W. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13230-13235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); however, FGF-10 also binds to FGFR1-IIIb (5.Luo Y. Lu W. Mohamedali K.A. Jang J.H. Jones R.B. Gabriel J.L. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16506-16515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The expression of FGFR2 is restricted to the epithelial cells of the developing lung at the onset of lung organogenesis at embryonic day 9.5 and becomes increasingly restricted to peripheral respiratory epithelial cells as lung development progresses (6.Peters K.G. Werner S. Chen G. Williams L.T. Development. 1992; 114: 233-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Orr-Urtreger A. Givol D. Yayon A. Yarden Y. Lonai P. Development. 1991; 113: 1419-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distinct patterns of expression ofFgf-7 and Fgf-10 mRNAs in lung mesenchyme and the complementary expression of Fgfr-2 in respiratory epithelial cells support a role for FGF signaling in lung morphogenesis. Experimental support for the role of FGF in epithelial/mesenchymal signaling during lung development has been obtained in vitroand in vivo. Ectopic FGF-7 caused cystadenomatoid malformations in the fetal lung, associated with increased chloride-dependent fluid secretion, cell proliferation, and disrupted branching morphogenesis in vivo and in vitro (8.Simonet W.S. DeRose M.L. Bucay N. Nguyen H.Q. Wert S.E. Zhou L. Ulich T.R. Thomason A. Danilenko D.M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1996; 271: L987-L994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fgf-7 expression in the fetal lungin vivo was uniformly lethal by 16 days of gestation and was likely related to the massive cyst formation induced by the polypeptide. Conversely, genetic ablation of Fgf-7 did not cause pulmonary abnormalities (10.Guo L. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), indicating that this polypeptide was not required for normal lung morphogenesis, but rather may play a role in pulmonary homeostasis following injury. A primary role for FGF-10 in lung development was demonstrated by the finding that targeted disruption of Fgf-10 resulted in mice lacking lungs and limbs (11.Sekine K. Ohuchi H. Fujiwara M. Yamasaki M. Yoshizawa T. Sato T. Yagishita N. Matsui D. Koga Y. Itoh N. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 12.Min H. Danilenko D.M. Scully S.A. Bolon B. Ring B.D. Tarpley J.E. DeRose M. Simonet W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In vitro, lung tubules migrate toward FGF-10-soaked beads, consistent with a chemotactic function for FGF-10 (13.Park W.Y. Miranda B. Lebeche D. Hashimoto G. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recently, creation of tetraploid fusion chimeras lacking embryonic expression of Fgfr-2 yielded mice with a lungless and limbless phenotype, similar to that seen inFgf-10 gene-targeted mice (14.Arman E. Haffner-Krausz R. Gorivodsky M. Lonai P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11895-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). FGF-7 is also a potent mitogen in the postnatal lung. Intratracheal instillation of FGF-7 caused transient, but marked, epithelial cell hyperplasia of both bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs of rats and mice (15.Ulich T.R. Yi E.S. Longmuir K. Yin S. Biltz R. Morris C.F. Housley R.M. Pierce G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16.Zsengeller Z.K. Halbert C. Miller A.D. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Bachurski C.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following FGF-7 treatment, cell proliferation peaks in 2–3 days, and lung structure and proliferative activity returns to normal 1–2 weeks after administration. Since FGF-7 has marked pro-mitotic activities in respiratory epithelial cells, its potential utility for prevention or treatment of lung injury has been explored in vivo. Pretreatment of the lung with FGF-7 protects animals from the effects of oxygen-, acid-, bleomycin-, or radiation-induced lung injury (17.Panos R.J. Bak P.M. Simonet W.S. Rubin J.S. Smith L.J. J.

Biol. 1996; 15: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additionally, FGF-7 has been shown to be increased in the lung in animal models of lung injury (21.Charafeddine L. D'Angio C.T. Richards J.L. Stripp B.R. Finkelstein J.N. Orlowski C.C. LoMonaco M.B. Paxhia A. Ryan R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L105-L113PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that FGF-7 has important functions in regulating the response of the lung to injury. Since Fgf-7 was uniformly fatal in utero when continuously expressed in the fetal lung, animal models that assess the chronic effects of FGF-7 on lung structure and function in vivo have not been developed. In the present work, transgenic mice were designed in which the expression of FGF-7 was placed under the control of a doxycycline-inducible gene control system (22.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), directed either by the 3.7-kb human SP-C or the 2.3-kb ratccsp gene promoters. By using this conditional system, fetal lethality observed in previous FGF-7 transgenic models was overcome. Induction of FGF-7 in utero altered branching morphogenesis and caused cystic dilation of the developing lung tubules. In the adult mouse lung, induction of FGF-7 altered gene expression caused widespread alveolar and bronchiolar hyperplasia that was largely reversible. Thertta construct was a gift of Dr. Herman Bujard (ZMBH, Heidelberg, Germany), and the 1-kb rtta coding sequence was placed under the control of the 3.7-kb human SP-C promoter (23.Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar) or the 2.3-kb rat ccsp promoter (24.Stripp B.R. Sawaya P.L. Luse D.S. Wikenheiser K.A. Wert S.E. Huffman J.A. Lattier D.L. Singh G. Katyal S.L. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that selectively direct expression of transgenes in respiratory epithelial cells of the lung (Fig. 1). Polyadenylation sequences from SV40 or the human growth hormone gene were used to ensure transcript termination. Plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing and then microinjected into mouse oocytes using standard transgenic procedures. Transgenic mice were identified using PCR primers specific for each transgene as follows: 5′ primer inSP-C promoter, 5′-GAC ACA TAT AAG ACC CTG GTC A-3′; 5′ primer in ccsp promoter, 5′-ACT GCC CAT TGC CCA AAC AC-3′; 3′ primer in rtta coding sequence used for genotyping bothSp-c-rtta and Ccsp-rtta mice, 5′-AAA ATC TTG CCA GCT TTC CCC-3′. Primers used for identification of (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 transgene are as follows: 5′ primer in CMV minimal promoter, 5′-GCC ATC CAC GCT GTT TTG-3′; 3′ primer in hFGF-7 coding region, 5′-CAT TTC CCC TCC GTT GTG-3′. Amplification of PCR product forSp-c-rtta and Ccsp-rtta was performed by denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min and then 30 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. Detection of (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 was identical except the annealing temperature was 54 °C. Animals were housed under pathogen-free conditions in accordance with institutional guidelines. A 50× doxycycline HCl stock (25 mg/ml in 50% ethanol, Sigma) was freshly prepared prior to each administration of the drug. Oral doxycycline was administered in the drinking water at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and 1% ethanol. Due to the light sensitivity of doxycycline, doxycycline water was replaced three times per week. Animals not receiving doxycycline were treated with vehicle only (1% ethanol final concentration). Lung tissue was homogenized in Tri-Zol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and RNA isolated following manufacturer specifications. RT-PCR was used to detect transgene expression and distinguish between endogenous Fgf-7 and the human FGF-7 transgene. Reverse transcription was carried out on 1 μg of total lung RNA in the presence of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm each dNTP, and 25 ng/μl oligo(dT) at 42 °C for 1 h. PCR primers for β-actin are as follows: β-actin primer 1, 5′-GTG GGC CGC TCT AGG CAC CAA-3′; β-actin primer 2, 5′-CTC TTT GAT GTC ACG CAG GAT TTC-3′; for humanFGF-7: hFGF-7 primer 1, 5′-ATA TCA TGG AAA TCA GGA CA-3′; hFGF-7 primer 2, 5′-CAT TTC CCC TCC GTT GTG-3′. PCR conditions for hFGF-7 were 94 °C denaturation for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. PCR conditions for β-actin were similar, but the annealing temperature was 59 °C. All reactions were run in duplicate with a negative control reaction lacking reverse transcriptase enzyme. No amplification was seen in reactions lacking reverse transcriptase (data not shown). Lungs were inflation fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 cm of pressure and then allowed to fix overnight at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols, and processed for paraffin embedding. 5-μm sections were loaded onto polylysine slides for immunostaining. Antibodies and procedures for immunostaining of TTF-1 and pro-SP-C have been previously described (25.Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The AQP5 polyclonal antibody, a gift from Dr. Anil Menon (University of Cincinnati), was used at a 1:1000 dilution and has been previously characterized (26.Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemical detection of BrdUrd, animals were injected with 0.1 ml of BrdUrd labeling reagent (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) per 100 × g of body weight 2 h prior to sacrifice. BrdUrd incorporated into DNA was detected using anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody and a BrdUrd staining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Volume of inflated lungs was determined after overnight fixation and an initial PBS wash. Inflated lungs were dissected from surrounding tissue and weighed by immersion in PBS. Paraffin-embedded lung tissue was cut at 5 μm and loaded onto silanized slides. Sense and antisense riboprobes were generated from a murine Fgf-7 cDNA orrtta cDNA cloned into pGEM3z and transcribed in vitro with a Riboprobe transcription kit (Promega). Conditions and solutions for hybridization are essentially as described (27.Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For the FGF-7 sense and antisense probes, hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C and washed under low stringency conditions. For the rtta sense and antisense probes, hybridization was carried out overnight at 55 °C and washed under high stringency conditions. Slides were dipped in Kodak NTB2 emulsion and exposed for 3–7 days. Slides were developed with Kodak D19 developer following the manufacturer's protocol. Transgenic mice were produced bearing the reverse tetracycline-responsive transactivator (rtta) fusion protein under control of the 3.7-kb human SP-C gene promoter or the 2.3-kb rat ccsp gene promoter (Fig.1), hereafter referred to asSp-c or Ccsp “activator” mice. The resulting founders were bred to establish permanent lines, screening for expression of the rtta transgene by RT-PCR and Northern blotting. Transgene expression was detected in only 1 of 15Sp-c-rtta and 1 of 7 Ccsp-rtta founders (data not shown). Separate transgenic mouse lines were generated by microinjection of a (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7transgene (Fig. 1 A), and two separate mouse lines bearing the target transgene were established. The (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 transgene consists of seven copies of the tet operator DNA binding sequence linked to a minimal CMV promoter (22.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), the human FGF-7 cDNA, and SV40 polyadenylation signals. Transgenic mice bearing either theSp-c-rtta, Ccsp-rtta, or (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 transgenes had no lung or other tissue pathologies and survived normally in the vivarium. To obtain transgenic mice in which FGF-7 expression was regulated by administration of doxycycline, Sp-c orCcsp activator mice were bred to (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 target mice producing bitransgenic progeny (Fig. 1 B). To determine the effects of inducing FGF-7 expression in utero utilizing the Ccsp-rtta activator mice, double transgenic Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice were generated. Fetal pups were obtained at embryonic day 17 after 7 days of doxycycline administration to the dam. Histological examination of the lungs from doxycycline treated Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic pups revealed marked cystadenomatoid malformation similar to, but less severe than, that induced by FGF-7 previously (Fig.2 B) (8.Simonet W.S. DeRose M.L. Bucay N. Nguyen H.Q. Wert S.E. Zhou L. Ulich T.R. Thomason A. Danilenko D.M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12461-12465Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Lung histology in littermates bearing only the (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 transgene was normal (Fig. 2 A). Cystadenomatoid malformations were detected in the lungs ofSp-c-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2 D). Consistent with this finding, human FGF-7 mRNA was detected in the lungs of these double transgenic mice in the absence of doxycycline but was increased 24 h after administration of doxycycline to the dam's drinking water (Fig. 2, G and H). TransgenicFGF-7 mRNA was not detected in single transgenic (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 (Fig.2 F) or Sp-c-rtta (not shown) transgenic mice in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Without doxycycline, double transgenic Sp-c-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 pups survived until birth but died in the immediate postnatal period, likely relating to the abnormalities in lung structure and function. Because of the expression of FGF-7 mRNA in Sp-c-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 double transgenic mice in the absence of doxycycline, Ccsp-rtta activator mice were used for subsequent studies. In the absence of doxycycline, double transgenic Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice survived postnatally, and no abnormalities in lung morphology were observed (Fig. 3 B). Administration of doxycycline to the drinking water of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice caused marked respiratory epithelial hyperplasia in the lungs of adult mice (Fig.3 C). No pulmonary abnormalities were observed inCcsp-rtta or (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 single transgenic mice treated with doxycycline (Fig. 3 A) or in bitransgenic mice that did not receive doxycycline (Fig. 3 B). Hyperplasia of the alveolar epithelium was first observed after 4 days of treatment with doxycycline (not shown) and was most pronounced near the pleural surface and surrounding conducting airways. Seven days after treatment with doxycycline, epithelial cell hyperplasia became more widespread. The bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium was thickened and was often lined by a pseudostratified rather than columnar epithelium (Fig.3 C). Epithelial cell hyperplasia was increasingly widespread 14 or 21 days after exposure to doxycycline (Fig. 3, E andG). The lungs of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice contained increased numbers of alveolar macrophages that increased with continued doxycycline exposure (Fig. 3 D). Additionally, the interstitial space between conducting airways, blood vessels, and lung parenchyma was typically widened, becoming more pronounced with increasing duration of doxycycline administration (Fig. 3, Cand E). There was no evidence of fibrosis or collagen deposition as assessed by trichrome staining (data not shown). AdultCcsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice treated with doxycycline for 21 days had dramatically enlarged lungs, although their body weights were less than untreated bitransgenic or doxycyclin-treated (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7single transgenic littermates (Fig. 4). Continued treatment of bitransgenic mice with doxycycline caused respiratory distress and was generally lethal by 21 days.Figure 4Lungs from Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7bitransgenic mice.

In the absence of doxycycline, FGF-7 mRNA was undetectable in the lungs of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice and in single transgenic littermates treated with doxycycline (Fig.5, A and B). Treatment of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice for 7 days with doxycycline increased FGF-7 mRNA in conducting airway and alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 5 C). In situ hybridization was used to identify cells expressing the rtta transgene under the control of the ratccsp promoter. In Ccsp-rtta transgenic mice, rtTA mRNA was readily detected in bronchial and type II epithelial cells (Fig. 5 E) in a pattern nearly identical to that seen inCcsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 double transgenic mice in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 5 F). Treatment of double transgenic mice for 7 days with doxycycline increasedRtta mRNA in respiratory epithelial cells in a pattern similar to that of the Fgf-7 transgene (Fig. 5 G). Thus, treatment of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 double transgenic mice with doxycycline induced both FGF-7 and RttamRNAs. Incorporation of BrdUrd into DNA was used to estimate cell proliferation in the transgenic mice. Although no changes in BrdUrd uptake were detected in the lungs of Ccsp-rtta× (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice 24 h after doxycycline (not shown), increased BrdUrd labeling of epithelial cells was noted after 4 days of doxycycline (Fig.6 B), the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells increased further after 7 days (Fig.6 C). BrdUrd staining was detected in respiratory epithelial cells in the lung periphery, although BrdUrd-labeled cells were occasionally detected in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Administration of doxycycline to double transgenicCcsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice increased the intensity of staining for TTF-1 (Fig. 7,C and D) and pro-SP-C (Fig. 7, A andB), the latter a specific marker for type II epithelial cells in the lung periphery. Both pro-SP-C and TTF-1 were readily detectable in the lungs of bitransgenic mice treated with doxycycline at dilutions of antibody at which little or no signal was detected in double transgenic littermates that did not receive doxycycline (Fig. 7,C and D). Respiratory epithelial markers SP-B, pro-SP-B, and HNF-3β were also increased in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic animals compared with untreated bitransgenic littermates (data not shown). Additionally, immunostaining for the CCSP protein, a Clara cell marker, was maintained in the hyperplastic bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and was not detected in regions of alveolar hyperplasia (data not shown). Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and proSP-C staining was increased 7 days after treatment with doxycycline (Fig. 7,B and F), AQP5 being detected in cuboidal and squamous epithelial cells in the lung periphery as well as bronchiolar epithelial cells. The hyperplastic epithelial cells stained heavily for AQP5 on apical membranes.Figure 7Immunohistochemical staining for proSP-C, TTF-1, and AQP5. Staining for pro-SP-C (A andB), TTF-1 (C and D) and AQP5 (E and F) in adult lung tissue ofCcsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice without doxycycline treatment (A, C, and E) or following 7 days of doxycycline treatment (B, D, andF). Staining for pro-SP-C, a marker for type II alveolar epithelial cells, and for TTF-1 was increased inCcsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice treated with doxycycline (Dox) for 7 days compared with untreated littermates. Staining for AQP5, normally found in squamous type I alveolar epithelial cells, was abundant in cuboidal type II alveolar epithelial cells and in bronchial epithelial cells following treatment of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice with doxycycline for 7 days. b, bronchi. Figure is representative of at least two mice from each genotype.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice were exposed to doxycycline in the drinking water for 1–21 days. Transgene expression was assessed using primers that amplified the human FGF-7 cDNA but not the mouse Fgf-7cDNA. In the absence of doxycycline, human FGF-7mRNA was undetectable (Fig.8 A). In contrast, humanFGF-7 mRNA was readily detected after 24 h of doxycycline and increased during the chronic administration of doxycycline. Mice that had been treated with doxycycline for 7 days were provided water without doxycycline and studied for 1–7 days thereafter. Human FGF-7 mRNA was decreased 1 day after removal of doxycycline and thereafter (Fig. 8 B). Lung histology was assessed in Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 double transgenic mice after cessation of doxycycline treatment. Respiratory epithelial hyperplasia was substantially reduced 7 days after cessation of doxycycline (not shown) and was nearly resolved 14 days after cessation of doxycycline (Fig. 3, F and H), with nearly complete restoration of normal lung parenchymal morphology. We have established a system for conditional expression ofFGF-7 in the lungs of transgenic mice, overcoming the prenatal lethality associated with expression of FGF-7 in the developing lung in vivo. Treatment of fetal or adult mice with doxycycline caused a rapid induction of FGF-7mRNA, resulting in cystadenomatoid malformation in fetal lung and epithelial hyperplasia in adult lung. In the adult lung, FGF-7 increased BrdUrd uptake and staining for pro-SP-C and TTF-1, consistent with proliferation and differentiation of type II epithelial cells. The effects of FGF-7 on cellular hyperplasia and targeted gene expression were largely reversed after removal of doxycycline. TheCcsp-rtta and Sp-c-rtta activator mice will likely be useful in generating mouse models in which diverse biologically active molecules are selectively expressed under control of exogenous doxycycline in developing or mature lung. FGF-7 caused respiratory epithelial hyperplasia and increased staining for a number of type II epithelial markers including TTF-1, HNF-3β, proSP-C, and SP-B. Epithelial hyperplasia was first seen in Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic mice 4 days after doxycycline treatment and persisted for up to 3 weeks. In contrast, FGF-7 caused epithelial cell proliferation and hyperplasia 3 days after intratracheal administration that resolved within 7 days (15.Ulich T.R. Yi E.S. Longmuir K. Yin S. Biltz R. Morris C.F. Housley R.M. Pierce G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Whereas the effects of intratracheal FGF-7 were noted primarily in the alveolar region, hyperplasia was also noted in the conducting airways after doxycycline exposure in our model, demonstrating that conducting airway epithelial cells are also responsive to the growth factor. Pleural thickening, associated with increased BrdUrd uptake, was also observed after chronic expression of FGF-7. The present observations are consistent with the finding that antibodies to FGF-7 blocked stimulatory effects of pleural lavage fluid from asbestos-treated rats on pleural mesothelial cells (28.Adamson I. Prieditis H. Young L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The interstitial space surrounding conducting airways and blood vessels was enlarged in Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice treated with doxycycline although the interstitium was not fibrotic. The lack of cells or extracellular matrix accumulation suggests that the increase in interstitial space may result from fluid accumulation. This possibility is supported by a dramatic increase and redistribution of AQP5 from its normal expression in type I alveolar epithelial cells to the hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells found inCcsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 double transgenic mice. Previous studies demonstrated that FGF-7 regulates fluid balance in the fetal lung (8.Simonet W.S. DeRose M.L. Bucay N. Nguyen H.Q. Wert S.E. Zhou L. Ulich T.R. Thomason A. Danilenko D.M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12461-12465Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9.Zhou L. Graeff R.W. McCray Jr., P.B. Simonet W.S. Whitsett J.A. Am. J.

Res. 1999; 46: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the present findings suggest that FGF-7 regulates AQP5 expression, an epithelial water channel. The increased expression of AQP5 in vivo is in contrast to a previous report demonstrating that FGF-7 inhibited Aqp5expression during in vitro culture of alveolar type II cells (30.Borok Z. Lubman R.L. Danto S.I. Zhang X.L. Zabski S.M. King L.S. Lee D.M. Agre P. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The distinct effects of FGF-7 on Aqp5 expression in the two systems may represent different responses of alveolar epithelial cells in vitro versus in vivo. Pulmonary edema is common in lung injury, and increased FGF-7 may be involved in resolution of edema. Consistent with this hypothesis, it is known that FGF-7 decreases pulmonary edema (31.Yi E.S. Salgado M. Williams S. Kim S.J. Masliah E. Yin S. Ulich T.R. Inflammation. 1998; 22: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), probably by increasing alveolar liquid clearance (32.Wang Y. Folkesson H. Jayr C. Ware L. Matthay M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 87: 1852-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In vitro, or following intratracheal doses, FGF-7 also regulates other mediators of fluid balance such as the epithelial sodium channel, the sodium/potassium-ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase), and the epithelial chloride channel ClC-2 (33.Guery B.P.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1352-C1360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-7 caused a marked increase in the number and BrdUrd labeling of alveolar macrophages. It is unclear whether this represents a direct effect of FGF-7 on macrophage recruitment or proliferation of alveolar precursors or is a response to the epithelial cell hyperplasia and remodeling of lung parenchyma. Chronic stimulation of FGF-7 in the lung caused severe hyperplasia that resembled a pre-cancerous human lesion, termed alveolar adenomatous hyperplasia (37.Colby T.V. Brambilla C. Brambilla E. Lung Tumors: Fundamental Biology and Clinical Management. 124. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 61-87Google Scholar). Withdrawal of doxycycline caused nearly complete remodeling of the lung, although mild epithelial cell hyperplasia was observed 14 days after cessation of doxycycline. Resolution of FGF-7-induced hyperplasia is thought to be mediated by apoptosis of type II cells and differentiation of type II cells into type I cells (38.Fehrenbach H. Kasper M. Tschernig T. Pan T. Schuh D. Shannon J.M. Muller M. Mason R.J. Eur. Respir. J. 1999; 14: 534-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After removal of doxycycline, the normal pattern of immunostaining of APQ5 in squamous epithelial cells was restored, consistent with differentiation of type II cells into type I cells. The reversible hyperplasia seen in our model agrees with recent transgenic models of neoplasia (39.Xie W. Chow L.T. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3593-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40.Chin L. Tam A. Pomerantz J. Wong M. Holash J. Bardeesy N. Shen Q. O'Hagan R. Pantginis J. Zhou H.

Cell. 1999; 4: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and suggests that inappropriate expression of FGF-7 was not oncogenic. TheRtta mRNA was detected in type II alveolar epithelial cells as well as in conducting airway epithelial cells inCcsp-rtta single transgenic mice. The presence ofRtta mRNA in type II cells was somewhat surprising since the ccsp promoter typically directs transgene expression to non-ciliated epithelial cells in the conducting airway. We have previously observed type II cell expression using the ratccsp promoter in transgenic mice, perhaps reflecting species differences or positional effects that influence the sites of expression. 2J. W. Tichelaar, S. Wert, and J. A. Whitsett, unpublished observations. FGF-7 caused proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells expressing the (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 transgene and also increased staining for TTF-1 within these cells. It is therefore possible that FGF-7 increased Ttf-1 expression that, in turn, may have influenced the level of activity of the ratccsp promoter per se (42.Zhang L. Whitsett J.A. Stripp B.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), increasing levels ofRtta that may further induce the activity of the (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 transgene. Conditional expression of FGF-7 in the fetal lung caused cystadenomatoid malformation in vivo, consistent with previous in vitro and in vivo findings (8.Simonet W.S. DeRose M.L. Bucay N. Nguyen H.Q. Wert S.E. Zhou L. Ulich T.R. Thomason A. Danilenko D.M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12461-12465Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9.Zhou L. Graeff R.W. McCray Jr., P.B. Simonet W.S. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L987-L994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The severity of malformation induced by Ccsp-rtta as compared with Sp-c-rtta may be related to the timing and level of expression, the SP-C promoter being active earlier in gestation (27.Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although lung abnormalities were not observed inCcsp-rtta-activated mice in the absence of doxycycline, cystic abnormalities were seen in the Sp-c-rtta-activated mice in the absence of doxycycline. The ability of low levels of FGF-7 to induce a cystic phenotype is consistent with the potent effect of FGF-7 on respiratory epithelial cells (43.Deterding R.R. Jacoby C.R. Shannon J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L495-L505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-7 expression was induced in the fetal lung of Sp-c-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 bitransgenic pups by the addition of doxycycline to the drinking water of the dam, indicating that the system remains inducible and of potential utility for study of lung morphogenesis and function. FGF-7 and FGF-10 both bind to the FGFR2(IIIb) receptor found on respiratory epithelial cells, predicting similar phenotypes following induction of these growth factors in the lung. However, effects of FGF-7 on lung morphogenesis are distinct from those caused by FGF-10, 3J. C. Clark, J. W. Tichelaar, N. Itoh, A.-K. T. Perl, S. E. Wert, M. T. Stahlman, and J. A. Whitsett, unpublished observations. suggesting that signaling by these closely related FGF polypeptides utilizes distinct pathways or modifiers. Recently it was shown that FGF-10, but not FGF-7, binds to FGFR1(IIIb) (5.Luo Y. Lu W. Mohamedali K.A. Jang J.H. Jones R.B. Gabriel J.L. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16506-16515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a receptor present in pulmonary mesenchyme (1.Finch P.W. Cunha G.R. Rubin J.S. Wong J. Ron D. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 7.Orr-Urtreger A. Givol D. Yayon A. Yarden Y. Lonai P. Development. 1991; 113: 1419-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the distinct effects of FGF-7 and FGF-10 on lung morphogenesis are influenced by FGF-10-mediated pathways in mesenchyme remains to be elucidated. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans influence signaling through FGFRs (44.Kan M. Wang F. Kan M. To B. Gabriel J.L. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the patterns of heparan sulfate expression and the extent of their glycosylation vary developmentally (45.Brauker J. Trautman M. Bernfield M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the differences in phenotype inFGF-7 and FGF-10 expressing mice may reflect differences in receptor activation by each ligand related to developmental changes in heparan sulfate proteoglycans or other modifiers of FGF-signaling pathways in target cells. Generation of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 double transgenic mice provides a tightly regulated system for studying the effects of FGF-7 in the respiratory epithelium. The utility of the Ccspsystem is evidenced by the finding that the human FGF-7transgene was not detected in unstimulated Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mouse lung and is further supported by studies using (tetO)7-CMV-luciferase mice to assay levels of Ccsp-rtta regulated transgene induction. 4A.-K. T. Perl, J. W. Tichelaar, and J. A. Whitsett, manuscript in preparation. Transgene expression was not detected in tissues other than lung, and cell proliferation was not increased in the livers of Ccsp-rtta × (Teto)7 -cmv-fgf-7 mice treated with doxycycline (data not shown), indicating that the activity of FGF-7 was restricted to the lung. The present findings support previous studies demonstrating doxycycline-regulated expression of IL-11 in mice co-injected with both Ccsp-rtta and (tetO)7-CMV-IL-11 transgenes (46.Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In those studies, inducible expression of IL-11 and pulmonary abnormalities were observed following doxycycline treatment, although IL-11 was detected in the absence of doxycycline. SinceSp-c-rtta and Ccsp-rtta were generated as independent activator lines, these mice can be bred to various “target” mice conferring conditional expression of exogenous genes in the lung. We thank Drs. P. Ray and J. Elias for helpful discussion and Dr. H. Bujard for the availability of the rtTA and (tetO)7CMV plasmids."

However, given the difficulty in modulating TIMP-2 levels, the direct effect of TIMP-2 on MT1-MMP processing and on pro-MMP-2 activation in a cellular system could not be established. Here, recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding full-length MT1-MMP or TIMP-2 were used to express MT1-MMP alone or in combination with various levels of TIMP-2 in mammalian cells. We show that TIMP-2 regulates the amount of active MT1-MMP (57 kDa) on the cell surface whereas in the absence of TIMP-2 MT1-MMP undergoes autocatalysis to a 44-kDa form, which displays a N terminus starting at Gly285 and hence lacks the entire catalytic domain. Neither pro-MT1-MMP (N terminus Ser24) nor the 44-kDa form bound TIMP-2. In contrast, active MT1-MMP (N terminus Tyr112) formed a complex with TIMP-2 suggesting that regulation of MT1-MMP processing is mediated by a complex of TIMP-2 with the active enzyme. Consistently, TIMP-2 enhanced the activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP. Thus, under controlled conditions, TIMP-2 may act as a positive regulator of MT1-MMP activity by promoting the availability of active MT1-MMP on the cell surface and consequently, may support pericellular proteolysis.

A major group of enzymes responsible for ECM degradation is the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The MMPs are multidomain zinc-dependent endopeptidases that, with few exceptions, share a basic structural organization comprising a propeptide, catalytic, hinge, and C-terminal (hemopexin-like) domains (1.Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 2.Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). All MMPs are produced in a latent form (pro-MMP) requiring activation for catalytic activity, a process that is usually accomplished by proteolytic removal of the propeptide domain. Once activated, all MMPs are specifically inhibited by a group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (3.Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).Over the last five years, the MMP family has been expanded to include a new subfamily of membrane-tethered MMPs known as membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), which as of today includes five enzymes: MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, MT4-, and MT5-MMP (4.Sato H.

MT1-MMP (MMP-14) was the first member of the MT-MMP family to be discovered and was identified as the first physiological activator of pro-MMP-2 (gelatinase A) (4.Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J.

In addition, cross-linking experiments using PM preparations demonstrated the binding of TIMP-2 to MT1-MMP and to the hemopexin-like domain of pro-MMP-2 (10.Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G.

Based on these observations, a model for the activation of pro-MMP-2 has been proposed in which the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP binds to the N-terminal portion of TIMP-2, leaving the negatively charged C-terminal region of TIMP-2 available for the binding of the hemopexin-like domain of pro-MMP-2 (10.Strongin A.Y.

This ternary complex has been suggested to cluster pro-MMP-2 at the cell surface near a TIMP-2-free active MT1-MMP molecule, which is thought to initiate activation of the bound pro-MMP-2. Pro-MMP-2 activation would occur only at low TIMP-2 concentrations relative to MT1-MMP, which would permit availability of active MT1-MMP to activate the pro-MMP-2 bound in the ternary complex. Thus, under restricted conditions, TIMP-2 is thought to promote the activation process by acting as a molecular link between MT1-MMP and pro-MMP-2.

The bound MT1-MMP turned out to be the active enzyme starting at Tyr112. Using radiolabeled TIMP-2 and PM extracts derived from COS-1 cells transfected with the full-length MT1-MMP cDNA, Zucker et al. (20.Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E.

However, the nature of the cross-linked MT1-MMP form(s) was not determined. Other studies showed the cross-linking of radiolabeled TIMP-2 with a purified autoactivated recombinant MT1-MMP lacking the transmembrane domain (13.Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M.

Finally, a 56-kDa form of MT1-MMP lacking the prodomain, found in the culture media of breast cancer cells, co-purified with TIMP-2 (23.Imai K. Ohuchi E. Aoki T. Nomura H. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2707-2710PubMed Google Scholar). Although various sources of MT1-MMP were used, these results were consistent with the active form of MT1-MMP being responsible for the binding of TIMP-2. Nonetheless, conflicting results were recently reported by Cao et al. (22.Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol.

Thus, the direct contribution of TIMP-2 to pro-MMP-2 activation and its effect on MT1-MMP processing could not be clearly assessed.

The results presented here demonstrate that the concentration of active MT1-MMP (57 kDa) on the cell surface was directly and positively regulated by TIMP-2. Absence of inhibitor, on the other hand, resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of active enzyme on the cell surface leading to the generation of a membrane-bound inactive 44-kDa species, which was further processed to lower molecular weight forms. N-terminal sequencing of the 44-kDa species revealed that this form starts at Gly285 and hence lacks the entire catalytic domain but maintains the hemopexin-like domain and the hinge region (1.Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). A previous study reported a N-terminal sequence of a 43-kDa species of MT1-MMP starting at Ile256in the catalytic domain (25.Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This species was isolated from the media of HT-1080 cells transfected to overexpress a soluble transmembrane-deleted MT1-MMP and therefore the enzyme and/or mechanism responsible for MT1-MMP cleavage in solution could not be established. Although both the previously reported 43-kDa form (25.Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and the 44-kDa species identified in the present study are functionally inactive, our sequencing data were obtained with wild type MT1-MMP and therefore the N terminus of the 44-kDa species is likely to represent a true cleavage site.Previous studies implicated MMP-2 in the processing of active MT1-MMP to the 44-kDa species (40.Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Atkinson S.J. d'Ortho M.P. Yamada K.M. Zardi L. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results clearly show that this process is MMP-2 independent since vaccinia-infected BS-C-1 cells do not produce detectable pro-MMP-2 (26.Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Fridman R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M.

Cleavage at the Gly-Gly285 peptide bond and consequent generation of the 44-kDa species was significantly inhibited by TIMP-2, as shown in cells co-expressing MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. Ellebroeck et al. (40.Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar) reported a reduction of the 44-kDa species in concanavalin A-treated ovarian carcinoma cells receiving exogenous TIMP-2. However, the effects of TIMP-2 on the profile of the MT1-MMP forms could not be differentiated from the pleiotrophic effects of concanavalin A, which may include effects on TIMP-2 and/or MT1-MMP expression as well as effects on cellular organization and plasma membrane structure. A recent study indicated that TIMP-2 modulates MT1-MMP activity in melanoma cells. However, a direct correlation between TIMP-2 expression and MT1-MMP processing could not be established (42.Kurschat P. Zigrino P. Nischt R. Breitkopf K. Steurer P. Klein C.E. Krieg T. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21056-21062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Based on the results in the vaccinia system, which allowed modulation of the level of TIMP-2 expression in the cells, we can conclude that the accumulation of the 57-kDa species of MT1-MMP and the reduction in the amount of the 44-kDa forms is a sole consequence of the presence of TIMP-2. The fact that TIMP-2, but not TIMP-1, inhibited the generation of the 44-kDa species further demonstrates that MT1-MMP processing is an autocatalytic event. The lack of effect of TIMP-1 is consistent with the weak inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 for MT1-MMP, as previously reported (12.d'Ortho M.P. Stanton H. Butler M. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Hembry R.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 43.Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effect of TIMP-2 can be mimicked by general synthetic MMP inhibitors (40.Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Atkinson S.J. d'Ortho M.P. Yamada K.M. Zardi L. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by exposure of cells to concanavalin A or phorbol ester, which may induce TIMP-2 expression.Due to the difficulty in modulating the level of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 expression in cells the direct contribution of TIMP-2 to the activation of pro-MMP-2 could not be established in a cell-based system. The data presented here show for the first time in a living cellular system that pro-MMP-2 activation by wild type MT1-MMP is tightly regulated by the level of TIMP-2 expression in the cells. These results are consistent with the biphasic role of TIMP-2 in pro-MMP-2 activation as first proposed by Strongin et al. (10.Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) in vitro. The stimulatory effect of TIMP-2 on pro-MMP-2 activation has been attributed to the formation of a ternary complex between MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and pro-MMP-2 (10.Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G.

However, our data show that BS-C-1 cells expressing MT1-MMP alone were able to initiate pro-MMP-2 activation suggesting that TIMP-2, and hence ternary complex formation, may not be an absolute requirement for pro-MMP-2 activation. Consistently, a C-terminal truncated TIMP-2, unable to form a complex with pro-MMP-2, and marimastat, a synthetic MMP inhibitor, can promote, at relatively low concentrations, the accumulation of active MT1-MMP and consequently the activation of pro-MMP-2. 2M. Toth, D. Gervasi, Y. A. De Clerck, and R. Fridman, unpublished results. Under these conditions, the surface association of pro-MMP-2 is likely to be mediated by other factors, which may include stable structural elements and/or nonspecific adsorption. Previous studies have shown that the association of pro-MMP-2 with the cell surface can be mediated by a variety of factors including ECM components (44.Steffensen B. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20622-20628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45.Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar).Our findings suggest that the effects of TIMP-2 on pro-MMP-2 activation may also be related to its ability to control the amount of active MT1-MMP in the cells by preventing the autocatalytic processing of active MT1-MMP on the cell surface. This is based on the observation that co-expression of MT1-MMP with increasing levels of TIMP-2 produced a gradual accumulation of the 57-kDa species that correlated, at the lowest level of inhibitor, with enhanced pro-MMP-2 activation when compared with cells expressing MT1-MMP alone. Thus, by binding and inhibiting a fraction of active MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 reduces the extent of autocatalytic processing of free 57-kDa species and therefore promotes its accumulation on the cell surface, which in turn enhances pro-MMP-2 activation. However, the ratio between free and TIMP-2-bound (inhibited) active (57 kDa) MT1-MMP has yet to be determined. At high inhibitor concentrations, activation of pro-MMP-2 was significantly diminished despite the higher amounts of 57-kDa MT1-MMP detected under those conditions. A plausible explanation for this apparent inconsistency may be the titration of all active MT1-MMP species by TIMP-2, which results in inhibition of pro-MMP-2 activation as previously proposed (18.Kinoshita T. Sato H. Okada A. Ohuchi E. Imai K. Okada Y. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16098-16103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19.Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J.

Furthermore, the maximum pro-MMP-2 activation observed at the lowest level of the 57-kDa species detected in the cells may reflect the high catalytic efficiency of active and TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP toward pro-MMP-2. This may also be the case in cells infected to express only MT1-MMP. Our data suggest that the 57-kDa species of MT1-MMP is the major pro-MMP-2 activator. This species is the active enzyme form, as determined by N-terminal sequencing, and its appearance correlated with enhanced pro-MMP-2 activation. In addition, we have shown that only PM fractions containing the 57-kDa species (derived from cells co-expressing MT1-MMP and TIMP-2) were able to initiate pro-MMP-2 activation whereas PM fractions lacking the 57-kDa species had no activity toward pro-MMP-2. Finally, the 57-kDa species co-migrated with the 57-kDa species of MT1-MMP detected in PM fractions of phorbol ester-treated HT-1080 cells, which were shown to activate pro-MMP-2 (10.Strongin A.Y.

The data presented here are consistent with the 57-kDa species of MT1-MMP being the major TIMP-2 binding form. Co-immunoprecipitation and TIMP-2 affinity experiments demonstrated that the 57-kDa species of MT1-MMP bound to TIMP-2, whereas pro-MT1-MMP and the 44-kDa form showed no binding under the same conditions suggesting that the latter forms exhibit a reduced affinity for TIMP-2. Considering that the 57-kDa species starts at Tyr112 and that pro-MT1-MMP showed no significant TIMP-2 binding, it is reasonable to assume that TIMP-2 interacts with the active site of MT1-MMP (48.Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of TIMP-2 to the 57-kDa species was abolished in the presence of EDTA, suggesting that the catalytic Zn2+ ion is required for TIMP-2 binding. These results are not consistent with the propeptide domain of pro-MT1-MMP being required for TIMP-2 binding (22.Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol.

These data demonstrate that integrin-dependent activation of phosphoinositide synthesis, actin stress fiber formation, podosome reorganization for osteoclast motility, and bone resorption require Rho stimulation. osteopontin α-minimal essential medium phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hemagglutinin phosphatidylinositol Rho, which plays a critical and regulatory role in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, is also involved in integrin-mediated signaling events (1.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in osteoclast function. Rho stimulates the activity of Rho kinase (ROCK) and the profilin-binding protein, Dia1, to augment the onset of stress fiber formation (2.Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E64-E66Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3.Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat.

Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of Rho family members on the actin cytoskeleton are mediated in part by phosphoinositide kinases (7.Barkalow K. Hartwig J.H. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1000-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chihara et al. (8.Chihara K. Amano M. Nakamura N. Yano T. Shibata M. Tokui T. Ichikawa H. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25121-25127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) has reported that microinjection of constitutively active Rho kinase into fibroblasts induced the formation of focal adhesions under conditions wherein stress fibers were disrupted, demonstrating dual functions of Rho kinase in stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly. Rho also plays an important role in osteoclast function. The actin ring structure typical of resorbing osteoclasts is disrupted by the C3 exoenzyme (9.Zhang D. Udagawa N. Nakamura I. Murakami H. Saito S. Yamasaki K. Shibasaki Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which specifically ADP-ribosylates (inactivates) the Rho protein (10.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar). The C3 enzyme also inhibits bone resorption (9.Zhang D. Udagawa N. Nakamura I. Murakami H. Saito S. Yamasaki K. Shibasaki Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoclasts are highly motile cells, which depend on rapid changes in their actin cytoskeleton to accomplish their ordered cycles of movement and attachment during bone resorption (11.Lakkakorpi P.T. Helfrich M.H. Horton M.A. Vaananen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 663-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kanehisa J. Heersche J.N.M.

Vaananen H.K. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, osteoclasts do not have the focal adhesion attachment structures characteristic of other cells (15.Abercrombie M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 207: 129-147Google Scholar). Instead, osteoclasts attach to culture or matrix surfaces through structures called podosomes, which are dot-like aggregations of actin that cluster in a ring around the cell periphery (16.Zhang D.

Res. 1997; 12 (abstr.): S137Google Scholar). Changes in podosome assembly/disassembly allow osteoclast migration, adhesion, and bone resorption. Peripheral rows of podosomes fuse to form the actin rings that circle the area under the osteoclast, where active bone resorption occurs (11.Lakkakorpi P.T. Helfrich M.H. Horton M.A. Vaananen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 663-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Taylor M.L. Boyde A. Jones S.J. Anat. Embryol. 1989; 180: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Väänänen K.

Res. 1988; 3: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although podosomes and focal adhesions are similar, important functional differences exist. Unlike focal adhesions, podosomes are highly dynamic structures with a 2–12-min life span compared with 30 min for the former (18.Kanehisa J. Yamanaka T. Doi S. Turksen K. Heersche J.N.M. Aubin J.E. Takeuchi H. Bone. 1990; 11: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Podosomes contain numerous proteins observed in focal adhesions of other cells, however, the arrangement of these proteins differ between the two structures. In podosomes, the actin microfilaments are surrounded by talin and vinculin, forming the rosette structure observed by immunostaining of these proteins (11.Lakkakorpi P.T. Helfrich M.H. Horton M.A. Vaananen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 663-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21.Taylor M.L. Boyde A. Jones S.J. Anat. Embryol. 1989; 180: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have reported data suggesting that gelsolin is the actin capping/severing protein of the podosome (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24.Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts isolated from bone marrow cells of mice rendered gelsolin-deficient by genetic recombination (Gsn−/−) have a markedly different distribution of actin, with no detectable podosomes (20.Chellaiah M. Kwiatkowski D. Alvarez U. Gillis M. Hruska K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12 (abstr.): S137Google Scholar). Furthermore, the integrin-mediated recruitment of signaling molecules required for motility and bone resorption in response to osteopontin (OP)1 is absent in gelsolin null osteoclasts (20.Chellaiah M. Kwiatkowski D. Alvarez U. Gillis M. Hruska K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12 (abstr.): S137Google Scholar). Likewise, osteoclasts derived from Src −/− mice fail to express podosomes (25.Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L. Hoffmann O. Lowell C.A. Garrett L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The inhibition of pp60c-Src expression by the use of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides demonstrated the direct upstream role of pp60c-Src in gelsolin-mediated actin cytoskeleton reorganization, podosome assembly, and bone resorption in avian osteoclasts (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated whether Rho is required in the formation of podosomes and integrin-mediated signaling in response to OP. We demonstrated that C3 exoenzyme eliminated podosome assembly. Using HIV-TAT-mediated delivery (26.Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) of Rho proteins into osteoclasts, we demonstrated that constitutively active Rho transduction was not only sufficient for podosome assembly but that it mimicked the effects of OP by stimulating actin stress fiber formation, motility, and bone resorption. RhoVal-14 transduction into osteoclasts regulated gelsolin-associated kinase activities further mimicking the actions of OP/αvβ3. Dominant negative RhoAsn-19 blocked the effects of OP stimulation downstream of gelsolin-associated c-Src. Therefore, Rho activation is not only required for podosome assembly and integrin-mediated signal transduction, leading to osteoclast motility and stimulation of bone resorption, but it is sufficient for these events. [γ-32P]ATP and rainbow molecular weight markers for proteins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein A-Sepharose, mouse IgG, anti-gelsolin antibody, phospholipid standards, and most of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Protein assay reagent kits and the reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Recombinant Src was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Rhodamine phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). RhoVal-14 and RhoAsn-19cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Alan Hall (MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Biochemistry, University College of London, London, United Kingdom). GST-C3 construct was kindly provided by Dr. Larry Feig (Department of Biochemistry, Tufts University, Boston, MA). Avian osteoclast precursors were prepared as described previously (24.Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27.Medhora M.M. Teitelbaum S. Chappel J. Alvarez J. Mimura H. Ross F.P. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1456-1461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, osteoclast precursors were isolated from bone marrow of egg-laying hens maintained on Ca2+-deficient diets. Partially purified preparations of mononuclear cells were recovered from the interface of Ficoll/Hypaque gradients. Nonadherent cells were separated from the adherent population after 18–24 h in culture. The nonadherent cells were sedimented, resuspended in fresh media (5 × 106 cells/ml), and cultured in the presence of cytosine arabinoside (5 mg/ml). Multinucleated osteoclast precursor cells formed between 3 and 6 days in culture, and the preparations were 70–90% pure multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive cells. Constitutively active Rho (V14), Cdc42 (V12), and inactive Rho (N19) were cloned in-frame into a bacterial expression vector, pTAT-HA, to produce TAT fusion proteins. The vector pTAT-HA has an N-terminal 6-histidine leader followed by the 11-amino acid TAT protein transduction domain flanked by glycine residues, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag, and polylinker (26.Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase protein was used as a control (42 kDa) (TAT-TK). The purification protocol is adapted from the published procedure using a Ni-NTA column (26.Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), and 8 m urea, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Imidazol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10–20 mm and purified in Ni-NTA column as described (26.Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Addition of 8 m urea to the sonication buffer allows for the isolation of insoluble proteins in bacterial inclusion bodies and efficient transduction into cells. Bound proteins were eluted with stepwise addition of 5–10 ml each of 100, 250, and 500 mm and 1 m imidazol in the above buffer. Urea was removed by rapid dialysis by using the Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce Chemical Co.) or by the use of desalting PD-10 columns (Sephadex G-25) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Desalting was done per the manufacturers instructions. Purification of C3 was done essentially as described (28.Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Osteoclast permeabilization with streptolysin O was done as described (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were washed twice with permeabilization buffer (120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mmEGTA, 10 mm MgCl2 (43.Kumagai N. Morii N. Fugisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly prepared dithiothreitol (5 mm), ATP (1 mm), and 0.5 unit/ml streptolysin O and C3 exoenzyme (100 ng/ml) (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) were added to the buffer at the time of permeabilization and incubated for 2–5 min at 37 °C. Resealing was achieved by the immediate addition of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and washed with serum-free medium. The incubation was continued for 2 h in serum-free medium and stimulated with OP (25 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. All the parallel experiments were treated the same as above but in the absence of C3 exoenzyme. GST-C3 exoenzyme was also purified in our laboratory as described (28.Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and used in these experiments. GST-C3 blocked the Rho effect at 200–250 ng/ml with an incubation time of 2–3 h at 37 °C. After cells were kept in serum-free α-MEM for 2 h, Tat proteins were added to cells to a final concentration of 100 nm in serum-free media. Dose and time-dependent uptake of proteins were determined. Doses in the range of 50–500 nm were used. Maximal uptake and response was seen at 100–150 nmconcentration. Uptake was seen within 15 min of incubation with TAT proteins. Following treatments as described above, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a Triton-containing lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.05, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmsodium fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm ZnCl2, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), and protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit. Equal amounts of protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were done as described (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,24.Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gelsolin. Immune complexes collected by the addition of protein A-Sepharose were used for kinase assays. The Sepharose beads, after washing several times with different buffers, were assayed for pp60C-Src or PI 3-kinase activities as described previously (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24.Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were cultured on glass coverslips or dentine slices. Fluorescent labeling was done with either HA antibody or Rhodamine phalloidin after osteoclasts were treated with HA-Tat proteins as described above for the indicated periods. Immunostaining was performed as reported previously (29.Wu H. Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parson J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Briefly, osteoclasts were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Antibody dilutions used were 1:100. Cells were washed and counterstained with Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. Actin staining was done with Rhodamine phalloidin as described previously (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed two to three times with PBS and mounted on a slide in a mounting solution (Vector laboratories, Inc., Burlingham, CA). The cells were viewed on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Thornwood, NY) and photomicrographs were obtained. Images were recorded and analyzed as described (30.Gupta A. Edwards J.C. Hruska K.A. Bone. 1996; 18: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The time-dependent distribution of Tat-RhoVal-14 protein in HA-stained osteoclasts were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope fitted with a spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Alexandria, VA). Assays for cell migration were performed in Transwell migration chambers (8-μm pore size) (31.Senger D.R. Ledbetter S.R. Claffey K.P. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Perruzzi C.A. Detmar M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar). Undersides of membranes were coated with either PBS or OP at room temperature for 4–14 h; membranes were air dried and washed twice with PBS. Membranes were rinsed with α-MEM medium prior to addition of cells. After 3–4 days in culture, chicken osteoclasts were washed twice with PBS and incubated at 37 °C with cell dissociation buffer (Sigma) for 20 min. Cells were removed by gentle scrapping and resuspended in α-MEM containing 1% serum and 2% BSA (50,000 cells/ml). Cells were added to the upper chamber in the above mentioned medium (100 μl) and allowed to adhere for 1–2 h. After cells attached to the membrane, TAT fusion proteins were added to a final concentration of 100 nm in the upper chamber in a serum-free α-MEM. α-MEM containing 1% serum and 2% BSA (600 μl) was added to the lower chamber. Cell migration was allowed to proceed at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator for 12–14 h. Cells were then removed from the upperside of the membrane with a cotton swab, and cells that migrated to the undersides were stained as follows. Wells were fixed with an alcohol/formaldehyde/acetic acid mixture (20:2:1) for 15 min. Filters were stained with hematoxylin stain (Sigma), rinsed well with water, and dried. Dried filters were cut out and mounted with permount solution (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) on a glass slide. Cells were viewed under ×40 objective in an inverted microscope and counted (Zeiss microscope) as mentioned (31.Senger D.R. Ledbetter S.R. Claffey K.P. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Perruzzi C.A. Detmar M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar). Data are presented as the number of cells migrated field (mean ± S.E.) and all assays were performed in triplicates. Statistical significance was calculated as described (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24.Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After 3 days in culture, avian osteoclasts were washed with PBS, and treated with cell dissociation buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were gently scrapped with a Teflon scraper and pelleted in serum-free α-MEM. Dentine slices (1.5 cm2 and 0.75-mm thickness) were processed for bone resorption assays as described (32.Takada Y. Kusuda M. Hiura K. Sato T. Mochizuki H. Nagao Y. Tomura M. Yahiro M. Hakeda Y. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Osteoclast suspensions (2 × 104 cells/well) were added to dentine slices that had been washed with α-MEM containing 1% BSA. After 2 h of adherence, the culture medium was replaced with α-MEM medium containing either Tat proteins (100 nm) or OP (10 μg/ml). Medium was replaced with the respective proteins after 24 h. Following 48 h, cells were scrapped from dentine and the slices were washed two times with water. Dentine slices were stained with acid hematoxylin (Sigma) and washed with water. Pits were viewed under ×40 objective in a phase-contrast microscope and photographed. To study the role of Rho in OP stimulated osteoclast actin stress fiber formation, cells treated with C3 exoenzyme were stained for actin following treatment with OP. In control cells (vehicle (PBS) treatment) actin filaments were enriched in the multiple peripheral rows of dot-like podosome structures of osteoclasts (Fig.1 A). Addition of OP for 15 min increased actin stress fiber formation anchored in new centrally located podosomes (Fig. 1 B, left) or central organizing areas (Fig. 1 B, right). New podosomes were larger in size and distinguishable from the original podosome structures (arrows, Fig. 1 B) by their donut shape. In cells treated with C3 for 2 h, podosomes dissolved and actin became disorganized in a structure involving the central part of the cell (Fig. 1 C, right). OP addition to C3 pretreated cells (C3/OP) produced actin coalescence into short, irregular actin cables (Fig.1 D). To further analyze the effects of Rho activity, we used HIV Tat-mediated delivery (transduction) of Rho proteins into osteoclasts. Constitutively active RhoVal-14 and dominant-negative RhoAsn-19 cDNAs were cloned into the bacterial expression vector, pTAT-HA, to produce TAT fusion proteins. The following HA-TAT fusion proteins were generated: RhoVal-14(25–30 kDa), RhoAsn-19 (25–30 kDa), Cdc42Val-12 (25–30 kDa), and a control HSV-TK protein (TAT-TK, 42 kDa). Purification and transduction of denatured proteins into osteoclasts were performed according to our reported methods (26.Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). After transduction of TAT proteins into osteoclasts, cells were immunostained with a HA antibody to measure the uptake of proteins. More than 90% of the cells were transduced with TAT fusion proteins. Confocal microscopy analysis of osteoclasts transduced with TAT proteins for 60 min confirmed the uptake of transduced proteins (Fig.2). A diffuse staining was seen in TAT-TK transduced cells (Fig. 2 B); punctate staining was seen in cells transduced with Val-14 or RhoAsn-19 proteins which included structures resembling podosomes and localization in structures surrounding large vacuoles (Fig. 2, C and D). Negligible HA background staining was seen in the control, untransduced, osteoclasts (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig.2 E for RhoVal-14, there was a time-dependent distribution of the HA-TAT Rho fusion proteins. By 15 min, there was a peripheral distribution of HA RhoVal-14 in areas consistent with podosomes. At 30 and 60 min, Rho was more diffusely distributed, and it was present in newly formed donut-shaped structures consistent with newly organizing podosomes. By 3 h, the Rho-stained podosomes were dot-like structures consistent with their maturation, and Rho was localized to large vesicular-like structures surrounding large vacuoles. At 6 and 9 h, Rho was diffusely localized in their rounded motile cells. By 12 h, the osteoclasts had respread, and Rho was present in many of the podosomes as the clear zone was re-established. Western analyses (not shown) of lysates from HA-RhoVal-14 or HA-RhoAsn-19 transduced osteoclasts for the times discussed above revealed a 33-kDa protein band. By 50 h HA immunostaining was diffuse and in vesicular bodies associated with protein degradation. The effects of transduced proteins on the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton were studied by staining of cells cultured on glass with Rhodamine phalloidin (Figs. 3 and4). Cells transduced with TAT protein (8–10 kDa) (Fig. 3 A) or control TAT-TK proteins (Fig.3 B) showed enrichment of F-actin in the peripheral dot-like podosome structures similar to PBS-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). A time-dependent increase in stress fiber formation was observed in TAT/RhoVal-14 transduced osteoclasts. By 15 and 30 min of RhoVal-14 transduction, stress fiber formation was increased along with the disappearance of the peripheral podosome organization (Fig. 3, C and D). These results are similar to the effects of OP (19.Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20.Chellaiah M. Kwiatkowski D. Alvarez U. Gillis M. Hruska K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12 (abstr.): S137Google Scholar). After 60 min (Fig.3 E) numerous new dot-like larger podosome structures were seen either at the cell periphery or in the cell center, regions where stress fibers terminate. After 3 h of Rho transduction, the podosome structures began to reorganize at the periphery (Fig.3 F) and stress fibers disappeared by 6–8 h (Fig.3 G). Podosomes appeared to be denser and larger in RhoVal-14 transduced cells (Fig. 3, E-G) than control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Stress fiber formation or podosome reorganization were not observed in osteoclasts transduced with dominant negative Rho mutant, RhoAsn-19(Fig. 3, H and I). Transduction of RhoAsn-19 into osteoclasts for 15 min (Fig. 3 H) or 30 min (Fig. 3 I) led to dissolution of F-actin in podosomes, which were replaced with membrane ruffles at the cell periphery.Figure 4Analysis of actin distribution in osteoclasts treated with C3/RhoVal-14, RhoAsn-19, and Cdc42.

However, this hypothesis has not been tested directly. We developed an <i>in vitro</i> model utilizing isolated rat retinas to determine the mechanisms underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and/or Pb<sup>2+</sup>-induced retinal degeneration. Confocal microscopy, histological, and biochemical studies established that the elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and/or [Pb<sup>2+</sup>] were localized to photoreceptors and produced rod-selective apoptosis. Ca<sup>2+</sup> and/or Pb<sup>2+</sup> induced mitochondrial depolarization, swelling, and cytochrome <i>c</i> release. Subsequently caspase-9 and caspase-3 were sequentially activated. Caspase-7 and caspase-8 were not activated. The effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup> were additive and blocked completely by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) inhibitor cyclosporin A, whereas the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 had no effect. The caspase inhibitors carbobenzoxy-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-CH<sub>2</sub>F and carbobenzoxy-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CH<sub>2</sub>F, but not carbobenzoxy-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-CH<sub>2</sub>F, differentially blocked post-mitochondrial events. The levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione and pyridine nucleotides in rods were unchanged. Our results demonstrate that rod mitochondria are the target site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup>.

However, how the large family of cell surface receptors that transmit signals through heterotrimeric G proteins regulates the activity of Akt is still poorly understood. In this regard, seemingly conflicting data suggest that the ability of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to stimulate Akt is cell type-specific. For example, initial reports indicated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which stimulates Gi-coupled receptors, does not enhance the activity of Akt in NIH 3T3 cells (4.Franke T.F. Yang S.I.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar), but recent studies have provided evidence that Akt can be stimulated by a variety of agonists acting on GPCRs in other cell types (7.Moule S.K.

The latter includes COS-7 cells, in which ectopically expressed Gq and Gi-coupled receptors, m1 and m2, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), respectively, were shown to activate Akt effectively when stimulated by carbachol, a cholinergic agonist (9.Murga C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).In the present study, we took advantage of the failure of GPCRs to stimulate Akt in NIH 3T3 cell lines to investigate the nature of the signaling molecules linking GPCRs to Akt. Here, we show that PI3Kβ is necessary and sufficient to stimulate Akt by the large family of GPCRs in the vast majority of cells, which do not normally express the G protein-regulated PI3Kγ isoform. Furthermore, we present evidence that GPCRs stimulate PI3Kβ by a pathway distinct from that utilized by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, as it does not require the phosphorylation of the p85 subunit in tyrosine residues or its recruitment to phosphotyrosine-containing complexes, but instead involves the activation of this PI3K isoform by the Gβγsubunits of heterotrimeric G proteins.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo begin exploring the molecular basis for GPCR activation of Akt in each cellular setting, we first re-examined the effect of LPA and carbachol on the enzymatic activity of Akt in COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells expressing endogenous and transfected LPA and m1 receptors, respectively. As shown in Fig.1 A, these treatments stimulated Akt in COS-7 cells but not in NIH 3T3 cells, although these agonists enhanced the activity of MAPK in both cell types, which served as a control. Interestingly, serum stimulated Akt in both COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells, thus suggesting that NIH 3T3 cells may be defective in one or more key molecular components involved in the transmission of signals from GPCRs to Akt.As PI3Ks are central elements of intracellular signaling pathways linking cell surface receptors to Akt (4.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar, 5.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar), we next examined which PI3K isoforms were expressed in each cell type. Two of the PI3K catalytic subunits, p110α and p110β, are believed to be ubiquitously expressed (1.Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 18.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). These PI3K subunits form heterodimers with non-catalytic subunits of the p85 family and are stimulated by receptor tyrosine kinases upon their recruitment to the plasma membrane by the assembly of phosphotyrosine-containing multimolecular complexes (1.Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 18.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Another PI3K catalytic subunit, p110γ, lacks the binding region for p85 proteins (19.Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsudo J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) but instead associates with a Gβγ-sensitive regulatory subunit, p101 (10.Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M.

(Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and thus can be regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins. This PI3K isoform exhibits a more restricted tissue distribution (22.Bernstein H.G. Keilhoff G. Reiser M. Freese S. Wetzker R. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 973-983PubMed Google Scholar). To explore which PI3K isoforms are expressed in NIH 3T3 and COS-7 cells, cellular lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for each p110 PI3K subunit, and their kinase activity was assessed using an in vitro lipid-kinase reaction. As shown in Fig.1 B, endogenous PI3Kα activity was readily detectable both in NIH 3T3 and COS-7 cells. In contrast, PI3Kγ activity was either absent or at levels below its limit of detection in both cell types. However, this PI3K was recovered from PI3Kγ-transfected NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B, second panel) even if its expression levels were not high enough to be detectable by standard immunoblotting techniques (data not shown). Using this enzymatic assay as a sensitive approach to explore the expression of PI3Ks, we also did not observe any endogenous PI3Kγ activity in COS-7 cells. This suggested that the presence of this G protein-regulated PI3K isoform cannot explain the ability of GPCRs to stimulate Akt in COS-7 cells and raised the possibility that another PI3K catalytic subunit may transduce the G protein-initiated signals in this cell type. In this regard, very high levels of endogenous PI3Kβ activity were found in COS-7 cells (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, no PI3Kβ activity could be detected in NIH 3T3 cells, although it was readily demonstrable upon exogenous expression of p110β.These findings prompted us to explore whether the expression of PI3Kβ in NIH 3T3 might confer the ability to activate Akt in response to agonists acting on GPCRs. As shown in Fig.2 A, whereas overexpression of p110α did not change the pattern of Akt activation observed in control-transfected cells, as expected, the expression of a G protein-regulated isoform, PI3Kγ, was sufficient to support the activation of Akt by the stimulation of m1 and LPA receptors (Fig.2 A). Remarkably, expression of the p110β subunit of PI3K was also sufficient to enable the activation of Akt by both GPCR agonists. A detailed time course analysis of the Akt stimulation by carbachol and LPA in PI3Kβ-transfected NIH 3T3 cells revealed that the expression levels of PI3Kβ achieved (Fig. 2 B) were sufficient to support the rapid and potent activation of Akt by these GPCR agonists, which was demonstrable as soon as 5 min after ligand addition and remained above control levels for more than 1 h (Fig.2 C). Furthermore, expression of this PI3K isoform also enabled the subcellular redistribution of Akt in response to GPCR agonists in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 D, an Akt-EGFP chimera containing the membrane-targeting domain of Akt (AH) fused to EGFP (16.Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) displays a cytoplasmic localization in control cells, either untreated or when stimulated with carbachol or LPA, but readily translocates to the plasma membrane upon PDGF treatment (Fig.2 D, upper panel). In contrast, carbachol and LPA promoted the accumulation of EGFP-Akt at the level of the plasma membrane when cells coexpressed PI3Kβ (Fig. 2 D,lower panel). Taken together, these results indicate that PI3Kβ can mediate the activation of Akt by GPCRs and that the expression of this PI3K isoform is necessary and sufficient to transmit signals from G proteins to Akt in these murine fibroblasts.Figure 2Expression of PI3Kβ in NIH 3T3 cells is sufficient to stimulate Akt kinase activity and to promote its localization to the plasma membrane in response to GPCR agonists. A, NIH 3T3 cells expressing m1 receptors were transfected with HA-Akt and plasmids (DNA) for GFP or the catalytic subunits of PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, or p101 and PI3Kγ, serum-starved, and left untreated (c) or treated with LPA (10 μm), carbachol (cch) (1 mm), or 10% calf serum (serum) for 15 min. Akt kinase assay (Kinase) and Western blots (WB) were performed as for Fig. 1. Autoradiograms are representative of three independent experiments. Arrows depict the migration of the phosphorylated H2B and HA-Akt.

B, COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells transfected with expression plasmids for GFP (control) or p110β (PI3Kβ) (4 μg per 10-cm dish) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-PI3Kβ-specific antibody (S-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and processed for Western blot (WB) analysis with the same antibody. An arrowindicates the migration of the catalytic subunit of PI3Kβ. A non-specific band of 105 kDa was observed in both control- and PI3Kβ-transfected cells, which served as a protein-loading control.C, NIH 3T3 cells expressing m1 receptors were transfected as in A with expression plasmids for HA-Akt and p110β, serum-starved, and stimulated for the indicated times with LPA (10 μm) or carbachol (cch) (1 mm), lysed, and subjected to Akt kinase assays (Kinase) and anti-HA Western blots (WB) as above. Arrowsindicate the migration of labeled H2B and the epitope-tagged Akt.D, NIH 3T3 cells expressing m1 receptors were grown in 24-well plates on coverslips and transfected with a plasmid expressing the AH of Akt fused with EGFP (pCEFL-EGFP-AH-Akt, 250 ng per well) together with an empty vector (control) or an expression plasmid for the catalytic subunit of PI3Kβ (PI3Kβ) (100 ng per well). As indicated, after serum starvation cells were stimulated with PDGF (10 ng/ml), carbachol (cch) (1 mm), or LPA (10 μm) for 5 min, washed, fixed, mounted, and photographed under uv light using an Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss) (× 63).

Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

As an approach, we performed PI3K assays on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from p110β-transfected NIH 3T3 cells upon treatment with serum, LPA, and carbachol. As shown in Fig.3 A, treatment with serum resulted in the recovery of PI3K activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. In contrast, LPA and carbachol treatments did not result in any demonstrable effect. Similarly, the amount of endogenous p85 protein recovered in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was only enhanced by serum addition (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with these findings, pretreatment of p110β-transfected cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein (100 μm for 30 min) diminished the activation of Akt by serum and PDGF but not when elicited by LPA and carbachol (data not shown). In addition, a mutant p85 protein lacking the p110 interacting domain, Δp85, which acts as a dominant negative interfering molecule for p85-mediated pathways (13.Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A.

Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the activation of PI3Kβ by GPCR stimulation does not require tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent events.Figure 3GPCRs do not promote the recruitment of PI3Kβ to phosphotyrosine-containing complexes. A, NIH 3T3 cells expressing m1 receptors were transfected with an expression plasmid for p110β as above, serum starved, and stimulated with 10% calf serum (serum), LPA (10 μm), or carbachol (cch) (1 mm) for the indicated times.

Thus, because of the failure of activated Gα subunits to stimulate Akt, we asked whether βγ dimers could induce the PI3Kβ-dependent activation of Akt. As shown in Fig.4 A, overexpression in control NIH 3T3 cells of β1γ2 subunits either together or individually did not cause any significant change in the Akt activity. In contrast, overexpression of β1γ2 dimers induced a remarkable increase in the activity of Akt in PI3Kβ-expressing cells. This activation was not observed when β1 or γ2 were expressed alone or when HA-Akt was coexpressed with β1 and γ2*, a mutant γ2 that lacks the γ-isoprenylation signal and therefore fails to associate with the plasma membrane (26.Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 28.Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

These results indicated that βγ but not Gα subunits promote the PI3Kβ-dependent activation of Akt and that functional, membrane-bound βγ dimers are required for this effect.Figure 4G protein βγ subunits mediate the activation of Akt by GPCRs in PI3K p110β-transfected NIH 3T3 cells. A, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for HA-Akt and GFP (NIH 3T3) or the catalytic subunit of PI3Kβ (NIH 3T3 + PI3Kβ) as in Fig. 1, together with expression vectors for GFP (c), the activated form of Ras (rasV12), the GTPase-deficient (QL) forms of the G protein α subunits αs, αi, αq, α12, and α13, or β1, γ2, and γ2* G protein subunits (0.5 μg per dish in each case) as indicated. Akt kinase reactions were performed in anti-HA immunoprecipitates from the corresponding lysates. Values in the graphs represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments and are expressed as -fold induction with respect to control-transfected cells. B, Akt activity was examined in cells transfected with plasmids for p110β and HA-Akt together with a plasmid expressing the carboxyl terminus of βARK fused to the CD8 receptor (CD8-βARK, 1 μg per 6-cm dish) or with a vector expressing GFP (GFP) as a control.

As shown in Fig. 4 B, transfection of this chimeric molecule in NIH 3T3 cells expressing PI3Kβ dramatically reduced the activation of Akt in response to carbachol and LPA, whereas the stimulation of Akt by tyrosine kinase receptors, such as PDGF, was not affected. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins play a key role in signaling from GPCRs to Akt by acting on the p110β isoform of PI3K.Accumulated evidence indicates that PI3Kγ can link GPCRs to a number of signaling pathways (1.Wymann M.P.

Sci. 1996; 351: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have suggested that the expression of this PI3K is restricted to few cell types (1.Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 22.Bernstein H.G. Keilhoff G. Reiser M. Freese S. Wetzker R. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 973-983PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we did not observe detectable levels of PI3Kγ protein or its lipid kinase activity in NIH 3T3 and COS-7 cells. Instead, this study and recently available evidence provide support for a novel role for PI3Kβ in signaling by GPCRs in the vast majority of cells, which do not express PI3Kγ. For example, it has been recently shown that this PI3K isozyme can be stimulated in vitro by purified G protein βγ subunits in synergism with p-Tyr peptides (32.Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and that a synergistic effect of receptor tyrosine kinases and GPCRs could be observed in PI3Kβ activation (34.Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35.Hazeki O. Okada T. Kurosu H. Takasuga S. Suzuki T. Katada T. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibody-blocking experiments implicated PI3Kβ in the mitogenic pathway initiated by LPA (36.Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these results and the present findings that PI3Kβ expression is necessary and sufficient to activate PI3K-depedent pathways by GPCRs in cells lacking PI3Kγ, such as fibroblasts, demonstrate a central role for the PI3Kβ isoform in signaling by G protein-linked receptors.Interestingly, although there is extensive sequence homology between the p110α and p110β PI3K catalytic subunits (37.Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), recent observations in knockout mice models suggest that these PI3K isoforms may perform non-complementary functions (1.Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 38.Bi L. Okabe I. Bernard D.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10963-10968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In this regard, our current findings suggest that one such distinct feature is the ability of PI3Kβ to act downstream from heterotrimeric G proteins. The structural elements responsible for this distinct coupling specificity are still unknown and are under current investigation.The emerging picture is that GPCRs stimulate PI3Kβ in most tissues by a mechanism distinct from those utilized by tyrosine kinase receptors, as it does not require the functional activity of the p85 non-catalytic subunit, but instead involves the activation of p110β by Gβγ subunits. We can also conclude that the distinct tissue distribution of each PI3K isoform may play an unexpected role in controlling the specificity in signal transmission, as it may govern the ability of GPCRs to stimulate a variety of intracellular signaling pathways that require PI3K function. In turn, the availability and level of expression of PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ may determine the nature of the biological responses elicited by the large family of G protein-linked cell surface receptors in each cell type. Many important intracellular downstream targets for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks)1 have been recently identified (1.Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 2.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Among them, the serine-threonine kinase, Akt-protein kinase B, has received special attention because of its central role in the regulation of cell survival or death in a large number of cellular systems (3.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). This kinase can be potently activated by growth factor r"

One of these genes encoded a unique, DC-associated C-type lectin, termed “dectin-1.” Here we report the characterization of a second novel gene that was also expressed in a DC-specific manner. Clone 1B12 encoded a type II membrane-integrated polypeptide of 209 amino acids containing a single carbohydrate recognition domain motif in the COOH terminus. The expression pattern of this molecule, termed “dectin-2,” was almost indistinguishable from that for dectin-1; that is, both were expressed abundantly at mRNA and protein levels by the XS52 DC line, but not by non-DC lines, and both were detected in spleen and thymus, as well as in skin resident DC (i.e. Langerhans cells). Interestingly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting revealed multiple bands of dectin-2 transcripts and proteins suggesting molecular heterogeneity. In fact, we isolated additional cDNA clones encoding two distinct, truncated dectin-2 isoforms. Genomic analyses indicated that a full-length dectin-2 (α isoform) is encoded by 6 exons, whereas truncated isoforms (β and γ) are produced by alternative splicing.

Members of the DC family are distributed to virtually all the organs (except the brain), where they serve as tissue resident antigen-presenting cells, playing critical roles in presenting environmental, microbial, and tumor-associated antigens to the immune system. Several years ago, we developed stable DC lines from the mouse epidermis (3.Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J.

These lines, termed as the XS series, maintain many important features of skin resident DC, i.e. Langerhans cells, and they have provided a useful tool for the application of modern technologies for studying DC biology (3.Xu S.

Xu, R. Ritter III, T. Kumamoto, D. Edelbaum, A. Morita, P. R. Bergstresser, and A. Takashima, submitted for publication. Briefly, we constructed a DC-specific cDNA library by subtracting cDNAs prepared from the XS52 DC line with excess amounts of mRNAs isolated from the J774 macrophage line. Following three rounds of screening of this library, we identified five novel genes that were expressed selectively by XS52 DC, but not by J774 macrophages. One of these genes encoded a type II membrane-associated polypeptide of 244 amino acids (aa) containing a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) motif at the COOH-terminal end. This polypeptide was, therefore, designated as DC-associated C-type (Ca2+-dependent) lectin-1 or dectin-1. Dectin-1 mRNA was expressed in skin resident DC (from which the XS52 line was derived) as well as in spleen and thymus, the tissues known to contain relatively large numbers of DC.2 Although the physiological function of dectin-1 remains unknown at present, the identification of a novel, DC-associated lectin is of particular interest, because one of the characteristic features of DC is the expression of many C-type lectins (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12080) Google Scholar, 2.Hart D.N.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3245-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, DC express DEC-205, a type I membrane-integrated glycoprotein that contains 10 distinct CRD motifs in the extracellular region (14.Jiang W. Swiggard W.J. Heufler C. Peng M. Mirza A. Steinman R.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). DC also express a macrophage mannose receptor (MMR), which is a type I membrane-associated glycoprotein with 8 CRD motifs (15.Sallusto F. Cella M. Danieli C. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). With respect to function, currently available data suggest that both DEC-205 and MMR mediate the uptake of glycosylated antigens by DC (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12080) Google Scholar, 2.Hart D.N.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3245-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sallusto F. Cella M. Danieli C. Lanzavecchia A. J.

Unlike DEC-205 and MMR, which contain multiple CRD motifs in the NH2-terminal ends, the second group of C-type lectins consists of the polypeptides that contain a single CRD in their COOH termini. Members of this group include: (a) hepatic lectins (HL) (or asialoglycoprotein receptors), (b) macrophage galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin (MGL), (c) CD23 (low affinity Fcε receptor), and (d) various receptors encoded in the natural killer gene complex (e.g. CD69, CD94, NKR-P1, Ly-49, and NKG2) (17.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 18.Brown M.G. Scalzo A.A. Matsumoto K. Yokoyama W.M. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Of these type II surface lectins, DC are known to express CD23 (19.Bieber T. Rieger A. Neuchrist C. Prinz J.C. Rieber E.P. Boltz-Nitulescu G. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Ring J. Stingl G. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and CD69 (20.Bieber T. Rieger A. Stingl G. Sander E. Wanek P. Strobel I. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). More recently, Bates et al. (21.Bates E.E.M. Fournier N. Garcia E. Valladeau J. Durand I. Pin J.J. Zurawski S.M. Patel S. Abrams J.S. Lebecque S. Garrone P. Saeland S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1973-1983PubMed Google Scholar) identified a novel, DC-associated type II surface lectin, termed DC immunoreceptor (DCIR). In summary, we now know that DC express both type I surface lectins (DEC-205 and MMR) and type II surface lectins (CD23, CD69, DCIR, and dectin-1). In this study, we have identified new members of the DC-associated type II surface lectin family. Female BALB/c mice (6–10-week-old) and female Lou/c rats (6–20-week-old) were housed in the pathogen-free facility of the Animal Resource Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All the experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. To study tissue distributions of dectin-2 mRNA and protein, mice were sacrificed by overdose methoxyflurane inhalation. XS52 cells are a long term DC line established from the epidermis of BALB/c mice (3.Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J.

Epidermal cells were isolated from abdominal skin of BALB/c mice using two sequential trypsin treatment and then enriched for Langerhans cells by centrifugation over Histopaque (1.083, Sigma) as described previously (11.Ariizumi K. Kitajima T. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25.Matsue H. Edelbaum D. Hartmann A.C. Morita A. Bergstresser P.R. Yagita H.

Kitajima T. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A DC-specific cDNA library was constructed by subtracting the cDNA library prepared from the XS52 DC line with excess amounts of mRNAs isolated from the J774 macrophage line, and this library was screened by colony hybridization, slot blotting, and Northern blotting to identify the clones that were expressed selectively by the XS52 DC line.2 The original clone 1B12 was one of the 50 clones that were selected in the above manner. To isolate additional clones encoding dectin-2 isoforms, the DC-specific library was screened again by using clone 1B12 as a probe. Northern blotting was performed as described previously (26.Ariizumi K. Meng Y. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6031-6039PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNAs (10 μg/lane) isolated from cell lines or mouse organs were size-fractionated on a vertical agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the 32P-labeled dectin-2 or GAPDH cDNA probe. RT-PCR was performed as before (11.Ariizumi K. Kitajima T. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Ariizumi K. Meng Y.

The PCR products were separated on agarose gel and analyzed after ethidium bromide staining or by Southern blotting as before (11.Ariizumi K. Kitajima T. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J.

His-dectin-2 fusion protein consisting of 6x histidine, and the extracellular domain of dectin-2 (clone 1B12) was produced inEscherichia coli as follows; the DNA fragment encoding an extracellular domain (aa 46–209) of dectin-2 was PCR amplified. BamHI and SmaI sites were then attached to the resulting DNA fragment at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. Using the BamHI and SmaI site, the fragment was ligated to immediately downstream of the 6x histidine sequence in pQE-30 vector (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA). This recombinant vector was introduced into E. coli; His-dectin-2 protein was extracted from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-treated E. coli in 8 m urea/100 mm sodium phosphate/10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Quiagen). After extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, relatively small fractions of the His-dectin-2 proteins were recovered in a soluble form and this fraction was used to test its carbohydrate binding potential. Briefly, His-dectin-2 proteins were labeled with 125I (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and incubated for 120 min on ice with agarose beads that were conjugated with mannose, fucose, lactose, GluNAc, or GalNAc (all purchased from Sigma). Specific binding was then examined by counting the radioactivities that were eluted by the addition of the corresponding carbohydrates. Lou/c rats were immunized initially by subcutaneous injection of insoluble fractions of recombinant His-dectin-2 proteins in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by biweekly injections of the same proteins in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. One week after the fifth immunization, spleens were harvested from these animals, and B cell hybridomas were prepared using the standard protocol (27.Yokoyama W.M. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 2.5.1-2.5.17Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were tested for the presence of antibodies reactive to His-dectin-2 proteins in immunoblotting. Positive clones were recloned by limiting dilution microculture. Immunoglobulin fractions were purified from the culture supernatants of clone R4C2 by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography using anti-rat IgG-conjugated agarose. XS52 DC were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) with 5–10 strokes with a 27-gauge needle on 1-ml syringe, centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g, and the resulting supernatant (“crude lysates”) was fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by centrifugation for 40 min at 100,000 × g. In some experiments, whole cell extracts were prepared from several different cell lines in 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. COS-1 cells were transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with pZeoSV2(+) vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing each of the three different dectin-2 cDNA clones; membrane fractions were prepared 72 h after transfection. These samples were separated by 10–20% or 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and then blotted with anti-dectin-2 mAb R4C2 or control rat IgG. After an extensive wash, the membrane was blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and then developed with ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A mouse genomic library (strain BALB/c) in EMBL3 SP6/T7 phage (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with a full-length cDNA probe for dectin-2 (Clone 1B12). Approximately 1 × 106 plaques were transferred onto nylon membranes and hybridized in buffer (50% formamide, 5x Denhardt's solution, 5x SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) containing the probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Mega prime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following a 16-h incubation at 42 °C, membranes were washed extensively in 2x SSC, 1% SDS, and then in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS. The membranes were autoradiographed at −80 °C. Hybridized clones were isolated and further purified by repeating screening. Finally, four independent phage clones were isolated. Phage DNA was purified from plate lysates of phage-infected E. coli and subcloned into a plasmid vector. The plate lysate was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min and treated with 1 mg/ml of DNase I and 5 mg/ml of RNase A and followed by chloroform extraction. Phage particles were precipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10% polyethylene glycol (6000) and 1 m NaCl, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% gelatin) and extracted with phenol and chloroform. Finally, the phage DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA). Genomic DNA fragments were excised from the phage DNA by digestion withBamHI and subcloned into a plasmid vector, pGEM-7zf(-) (Promega, Madison, WI). To determine restriction fragments containing exons, the subcloned DNAs were digested with different restriction enzymes and southern hybridized with a 1B12 cDNA probe. The hybridized DNA fragments were eluted from agarose gel and further subcloned into a pBluescript II SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and their DNA sequences were determined. As described in the Introduction, using a subtractive cloning strategy (XS52 DC line minus J774 macrophage line), we isolated five cDNA clones that were expressed selectively by XS52 DC and that encoded novel polypeptides. One of these clones (clone 1C11–5) encoded a 244-aa polypeptide, termed dectin-1, which contained a single CRD motif in the COOH terminus. Another clone 1B12 contained 630 nt in its open reading frame. As shown in Fig.1, its deduced amino acid sequence revealed a 209-aa polypeptide of type II membrane-integrated configuration, consisting of a cytoplasmic domain (aa 1–14), a putative transmembrane domain (aa 15–42), and extracellular domains (aa 43–209). The overall amino acid sequence encoded by clone 1B12 showed 33.5% sequence identity (Clustral method analyzed with Lasergene Program, DNA Star, Madison, WI) to murine (m) DCIR, a DC-associated surface receptor (21.Bates E.E.M. Fournier N. Garcia E. Valladeau J. Durand I. Pin J.J. Zurawski S.M. Patel S. Abrams J.S. Lebecque S. Garrone P. Saeland S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1973-1983PubMed Google Scholar). The 1B12 polypeptide sequence also showed significant homology with other molecules, including mMGL (23.4%) (28.Sato M. Kawakami K. Osawa T. Toyoshima S. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), mHL2 (22.0%) (29.Sanford J.P. Doyle D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), mHL1 (21.1%) (30.Takezawa R. Shinzawa K. Watanabe Y. Akaike T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), mCD69 (16.6%) (31.Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Hjerrild K.A. Armitage R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and mCD23 (16.3%) (32.Gollnick S.O. Trounstine M.L. Yamashita L.C. Kehry M.R. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1974-1982PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these molecules contained a single CRD motif at the COOH-terminal end and, thus, belongs structurally to the type II membrane-associated C-type lectin family. As indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1, the COOH-terminal region (aa 79–209) of the 1B12 polypeptide contained all the 13 invariant amino acid residues known to be conserved in the CRD motifs of many C-type lectins (33.Spiess M. Biochem. 1990; 29: 10009-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus, we designated this polypeptide as DC-associated C-type lectin-2 or dectin-2. As noted in Fig. 2 A, the CRD domain in the dectin-2 polypeptide exhibited marked homology with the CRD sequences in other C-type lectins, such as DCIR (44.7%), MGL (43.8%), HL2 (45.8%), HL1 (39.6%), CD69 (33.3%), and CD23 (28.0%). The degree of sequence homology between dectin-1 and dectin-2 was 19.6% in the overall sequence and 24.8% within the CRD domain (Fig.2 B). Phylogenic analysis of the CRD domains (by using the MegAlign function of Lasergene Program) indicated that dectin-2 is intermediate in structure between the HL/MGL subfamily and the CD23/CD69 subfamily, whereas dectin-1 appears to be further distant from either subfamily (Fig. 2 C). Like many C-type lectins (e.g. CD94, Ly-49, and NKG2) that are encoded in the natural killer gene complex (18.Brown M.G. Scalzo A.A. Matsumoto K. Yokoyama W.M. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34.Houchins J.P. Lanier L.L. Neimi E.C. Phillips J.H. Ryan U.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3603-3609PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Vivier E. Daeron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), DCIR contains the consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs ((I/V)XYXX(L/V)) in the cytoplasmic domain (21.Bates E.E.M. Fournier N. Garcia E. Valladeau J. Durand I. Pin J.J. Zurawski S.M. Patel S. Abrams J.S. Lebecque S. Garrone P. Saeland S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1973-1983PubMed Google Scholar). Like other C-type lectins (e.g. CD23 and MGL), dectin-1 contained a putative immunoreceptor tyrosin-based activation motif (YXXL) (35.Vivier E. Daeron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 36.Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar) in the cytoplasmic domain.2Interestingly, neither the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif nor the immunoreceptor tyrosin-based activation motif was found in the relatively short (14 aa) cytoplasmic tail of dectin-2. In summary, dectin-2 is a new member of the type II surface lectin family containing a single CRD motif and a non-CRD region (termed the “neck” domain) in the COOH-terminal extracellular domains and no apparent signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic domain. In Northern blotting, we identified a major dectin-2 mRNA of 1.5 kb expressed by the XS52 DC line (Fig.3 A). Dectin-2 mRNA was undetectable in any of the tested non-DC lines, including two macrophage lines (J774 and Raw), three T cell lines (7–17, HDK-1, and D10), a B cell hybridoma (5C5), a keratinocyte line (Pam 212), and a fibroblast line (NS01). The observed cell type specificity was not simply, because of the fact that only the XS52 DC line was cultured in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor and CSF-1 (3.Xu S.

Gilmore G.L. Xu S. Taylor R.S. Bergstresser P.R. Ariizumi K. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5128-5135PubMed Google Scholar), because this line continued to express dectin-2 mRNA even after removal of these cytokines from culture medium and because its expression was not inducible in the J774 macrophage line by exposure to either cytokine (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig.3 C, dectin-2 mRNA was expressed most abundantly in the spleen and thymus, tissues known to contain relatively large numbers of DC (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12080) Google Scholar, 2.Hart D.N.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3245-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, dectin-2 mRNA was not detectable by Northern blotting in the skin, despite the facts that the XS52 DC line was established from this tissue (3.Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J.

Escherichia coli Nth and Fpg and nuclear extracts from XRS5, a Chinese hamster ovary Ku-deficient cell line, have been used to study the influence on their substrate recognition by the presence of a neighboring damage or an abasic site on the opposite strand, as models of clustered DNA damage. These proteins were tested for their efficiency to induce a single-strand break on a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing either an abasic (AP) site, dihydrothymine (DHT), 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′deoxyguanine, or 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′deoxyadenine at positions 1, 3, or 5 base pairs 5′ or 3′ to either an AP site or DHT on the labeled strand. DHT excision is much more affected than cleavage of an AP site by the presence of other damage. The effect on DHT excision is greatest with a neighboring AP site, with the effect being asymmetric with Nth and Fpg. Therefore, this large inhibition of the excision of DHT by the presence of an opposite AP site may minimize the formation of double-strand breaks in the processing of DNA clustered damages.

Thacker J. Cox R. Int. J. Radiat. Res. 1993; 63: 543-556Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar,2.Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). The complexity of radiation-induced clustered DNA damage increases on increasing the ionizing density of the radiation (LET).1 From track structure simulations, ∼20% of double-strand breaks are associated with other damages for low LET radiation but increased to >20% for double-strand breaks induced by high LET α-radiation (3.Nikjoo H. O'Neill P. Terrisol M. Goodhead D.T. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1999; 38: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Indirect experimental evidence supporting the role of DNA damage complexity comes from the reduced repairability of double-strand breaks induced in cellular DNA by high LET radiation (4.Blöcher D. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1988; 54: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5.Jenner T.J. de Lara C.M. O'Neill P. Stevens D.L. Int. J. Radiat.

If base damages within a cluster are on opposite strands and both excised, this gives rise to double-strand breaks. Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the way in which several damages in close proximity are recognized/processed by the cell. Although the chemical nature of oxidative damage produced by oxidative stress and by ionizing radiation are similar, the unique feature of ionizing radiation and radiation mimetic agents is their ability to produce clustered damage. There are only few studies about the excision of a damage substrate in the vicinity of another damage. In particular, synthesized oligonucleotides containing damage at specific sites were used to focus on the efficiencies of endonucleases VIII (Nei) and III (Nth) to excise either thymine glycol or DHT when opposite a single-strand gap (10.Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as well as the efficiency of Fpg to excise 8-oxo-G or AP site opposite a gap (11.Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or 8-oxo-G near a formylamine on the same strand (12.Bourdat A.-G. Gasparutto D. Cadet J.

These DNA glycosylases, e.g. bacterial Nth protein and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), are involved in the first step of the base excision repair to remove specific modified bases from DNA (14.Laval J.

Since major base modifications produced by ionizing radiation are DHT (through reduction pathway), 8-oxoG, and 8-oxoA (through oxidative pathways) (24.Fuciarelli A.F. Wegher B.J. Blakery W.F.

This study represents the first investigation to address the way in which clustered DNA base damage is removed by nuclear extracts (from Ku-deficient CHO cells, XRS5; see Refs. 25.Thacker J.

The nuclear extracts from the Ku-deficient CHO-derived cell line XRS5 were used to gain insight into the role of a composite of enzyme present in the nucleus of mammalian cells. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys or Glen Research. The sequences of the 40-mer oligonucleotides are presented in Table I. Strand 2 contains either DHT, 8-oxoG, 8-oxoA, or a uracil (or the corresponding undamaged base as controls) at a fixed position (position X). Strand 1 contains a uracil (that could be remove by uracil-DNA-glycosylase (Ung) to give an abasic site), a DHT, or thymine as a control at given but variable positions (position Y) opposite to the fixed damage on strand 2. The oligonucleotides were 32P 5′-end-labeled using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) in 25 μl of the recommended buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Following purification on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the labeled oligonucleotide was hybridized with 1.5-fold excess of the purified non-radiolabeled complementary strand. That the annealing was efficient was verified by migration on a native 10% polyacrylamide gel. To prepare the oligonucleotides containing an abasic site at given positions, the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a uracil were treated with 1 unit of uracil-DNA-glycosylase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA).Table IOligonucleotide sequences−55′-ctcttagtca ggaaYatgtN tctatgctgg gagcaaaggc-3′(1)3′-gagaatcagt ccttatacaX agatacgacc ctcgtttccg-5′(2)−35′-ctcttagtca ggaataYgtN tctatgctgg gagcaaaggc-3′3′-gagaatcagt ccttatacaX agatacgacc ctcgtttccg-5′−15′-ctcttagtca ggaatatgYN tctatgctgg gagcaaaggc-3′3′-gagaatcagt ccttatacaX agatacgacc ctcgtttccg-5′+15′-ctcttagtca ggaatatgtN Yctatgctgg gagcaaaggc-3′3′-gagaatcagt ccttatacaX agatacgacc ctcgtttccg-5′+35′-ctcttagtca ggaatatgtN tcYatgctgg gagcaaaggc-3′3′-gagaatcagt ccttatacaX agatacgacc ctcgtttccg-5′+55′-ctcttagtca ggaatatgtN tctaYgctgg gagcaaaggc-3′3′-gagaatcagt ccttatacaX agatacgacc ctcgtttccg-5′+85′-ctcttagtca ggaatatgtN tctatgcYgg gagcaaaggc-3′3′-gagaatcagt ccttatacaX agatacgacc ctcgtttccg-5′X and Y represent AP, DHT, 8-oxoG, 8-oxoA or the normal corresponding base (T for AP and DHT, G for 8-oxoG or A for 8-oxoA).

After a brief centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was removed, and the nucleus pellet was resuspended in 2/3 volume of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) for 30 min with agitation on ice. After a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was dialyzed 3 times over a period of 2 h against 1 liter of incubating buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol containing 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF). The protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford colorimetric technique, and the aliquots of nuclear extracts were stored at −80 °C. The double-stranded oligonucleotides (10,000 cpm, 200 fmol) were incubated with increasing amounts of Nth, Fpg proteins, or XRS5 nuclear extracts, as specified in the legends of the figures, in 5 μl of the incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 5 μl of the denaturing stop solution was added (98% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) to the samples that were then subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) for 90 min at 85 watts. The dried gel was then exposed to a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager screen to visualize cleaved and full-length DNA fragments using phosphorimagery (Bio-Rad, Molecular Imager® FX) and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) to determine the excision efficiency of each enzyme for each of the DNA sequences used. The number of nicks reflects the number of modified bases excised. The activity of the cleaved strand is expressed as a percentage of the total activity of the cleaved and intact strand. The efficiencies for multiple damages are compared with that for single damage to assess the effect of the second damage, present on the unlabeled strand, on the excision of the damage on the labeled strand by the various proteins. The experiments were done as described above for the analysis of single-strand breaks, except the reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of a non-denaturing solution (40% sucrose, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The samples were run on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE for 3 h at 300 V, dried, and quantified using the Bio-Rad PhosphorImager as described above. The efficiency of the various proteins to remove specific single substrates from DNA was first compared as controls using denaturing gels. With a fixed concentration of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing one specific damage and increasing amounts of either purified proteins or XRS5 nuclear extracts, the excision efficiency was determined from the amount of cleaved DNA compared with the total amount of DNA present (Fig.1 A and TableI). As presented in Fig. 1 B, Nth is 100-fold more efficient at removing an AP site than DHT, from the relative concentrations of Nth to give 50% cleavage of the DNA. As shown in Fig. 1 C with Fpg, the AP site is also the most efficiently removed damage, whereas 8-oxoG and DHT are excised less efficiently (7.5- and 75-fold, respectively) than an AP site. It is worth noting that Fpg does not excise 8-oxoA from DNA even when using a high concentration (200 ng) of protein. In an approach to mimic DNA damage processing in cells, XRS5 nuclear extracts have been used to determine its efficiency to excise AP site, uracil, 8-oxoG or DHT from DNA. Fig. 1 D shows that an AP site is cleaved most efficiently by nuclear extracts, whereas uracil and 8-oxoG are excised less efficiently (70- and 40-fold, respectively) by nuclear extract than an AP site. DHT is the least efficiently excised damage, requiring 180-fold greater quantity of nuclear extract to cleave 20% of the DNA compared with that for excision of the AP site (Fig. 1 D). The 3′ end of the AP site containing oligonucleotides obtained after cleavage of the AP site Nth, Fpg proteins, or XRS5 nuclear extracts migrates at a different position in gel (data not shown). These bands correspond to a 3′-phosphoaldehyde obtained by a β elimination using Nth, to a 3′ phosphate processed via a β-δ elimination by Fpg (31.Bailly V. Verly W.G. O'Connor T. Laval J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 32.O'Connor T.R. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5222-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33.Bhagwat M. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and 3′ OH termini using nuclear extracts in which exonucleases or 3′-phosphatases clean up the 3′ ends to give the 3′ OH termini required by DNA polymerases to repair the strand break. The efficiency of Nth to excise an AP site was determined when further damage is positioned on the non-labeled strand at defined positions opposite to the AP site. In Fig.2 A, this other damage, an AP site, was situated from 5 bases 3′ up to 8 bases 5′ from the fixed AP site of interest (position X) on the labeled strand of DNA (see Table I). In Fig. 2, B and C, 8-oxoG and 8-oxoA were positioned 5, 3, or 1 base(s) 5′ or 3′ from the AP site on the labeled strand. The largest effect on excision of the AP site by Nth is a 2.1-fold inhibition due to the presence of an AP site one base 5′ opposite to the AP site of interest (position +1 in Fig.2 A). An AP site situated at any of the other positions as well as 8-oxoG, 8-oxoA, or DHT (Fig. 2, B–D, respectively) at any position do not significantly affect cleavage of an AP site by Nth. The same oligonucleotides were assayed for cleavage of the AP site by Fpg. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of 8-oxoG, 8-oxoA, or DHT (Fig. 3, B–D, respectively) does not significantly influence the efficiency of AP excision by Fpg. In contrast, another AP site has an inhibitory effect (up to 3.3-fold inhibition, Fig. 3 A), even when positioned up to 8 bases opposite to the AP site on the labeled strand.Figure 3Effect of the presence of another opposite damage on the AP site excision efficiency by Fpg. The same oligonucleotides as in Fig. 2 are incubated with an increasing amounts of Fpg (1 pg up to 5 ng). −5 up to +8 represent the different positions of the opposite damage from 5 bases 5′ up to 8 bases 3′ from the AP site as described in Table I. The diagrams reflected the fold inhibition/activation by comparison to the control containing no other damage on the strand opposite to the AP site from 3 to 5 different experiments. The error bars represented the standard deviation of the values presented on the right of the diagrams.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar results were obtained using XRS5 nuclear extracts where 8-oxoG, 8-oxoA, or DHT do not significantly influence the efficiency of cleavage of the AP site excision (Fig. 4,B and C and data not shown, respectively). However, the presence of another AP site results in an enhancement of the excision efficiency of the AP site when the other AP site is positioned between 1 and 5 bases 5′ to the AP site of interest on the complementary strand (Fig. 4 A), with maximum activation seen when the other AP site is 3 bases away in the 5′ direction (position+3, Fig. 4 A). This enhancement contrasts with the inhibition seen for excision by Fpg and Nth. No effect was observed if the other AP site is 3′ or more than 8 bases 5′ from the AP site on the labeled strand. Therefore, the major effect on excision on an AP site is due to the presence of another AP site at various positions opposite the AP site at the fixed X position on the labeled strand presented above. To assess whether the inhibition of the cutting efficiency for both Nth and Fpg and the stimulation of AP excision by XRS5 nuclear extracts is strand- or sequence-specific, we performed similar experiments but using oligonucleotides that were 5′-labeled on the strand containing an AP site at the variable Y positions. The results are presented in Fig. 5. The inhibitory effect on excision of an AP site at the variable positionsY by Nth (Fig. 5 A) is comparable with that at the fixed position X (Fig. 2 A) and similarly shows an inhibitory effect of about 2 for an AP site 1 base 5′ to the AP site of interest. The inhibitory pattern of an opposite AP site on the excision of an AP site by Fpg is similar when the AP site is in positionY (Fig. 5 B) or X (Fig. 3 A) of the labeled strand. The inhibitory effect is up to 3.9 and 3.3 when the AP site is positioned 1 base 5′ opposite to the AP site at positionY (Fig. 5 B) or X (Fig. 3 A), respectively. Similar concordance of results is obtained for XRS5 nuclear extracts using oligonucleotide labeled on the strand that contains the AP site at position X (Fig. 4 A) orY (Fig. 5 C). Some minor variations in the level of activation are seen and may reflect differences in the sequence context of the AP site, but activation of the excision of the AP site by the nuclear extracts is clearly correlated to the relative positions of the two opposite AP sites. The inhibitory/activation effects by an AP site on the excision of an opposite AP site does not depend significantly on sequence context. We have tested the ability of Nth, Fpg, and XRS5 nuclear extract to excise DHT from DNA when another damage is positioned on the other nonlabeled strand. The largest inhibitory effect of DHT excision by Nth is seen in the presence of an AP site opposite to the DHT, and the effect is asymmetrical (Fig. 6). The inhibition occurs when the AP site is between −3 and +8 bases from the DHT site, with a maximum of 52-fold inhibition when the AP site is positioned 1 base 5′ from the DHT (Fig. 6 A). Uracil-containing oligonucleotides show a minor effect on the efficiency of excision of DHT by Nth (Fig. 6 B). A minor effect was also observed with DHT opposite to DHT at the various positions shown in Fig.6 C. In contrast, 8-oxoG and 8-oxoA positioned 1 base 5′ from the DHT (positions +1, Fig. 6, D andE) have an inhibitory effect on the excision of DHT by Nth. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of the second damage is always asymmetrical in double-stranded DNA. Since the presence of an AP site greatly inhibits the excision of DHT by Nth, we examined whether this inhibition of single-strand break formation correlated with the formation of a double-strand break. Therefore, the same experiment was performed as in Fig. 6 A,but the samples were divided as follows: one-half ran on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the other half ran on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel. The percentage of single- or double-strand breaks induced by Nth in the DNA-specific oligonucleotides is represented in Fig. 7, A and B, respectively. A high yield of single-strand breaks but no double-strand breaks are produced in the control that contains only one damage. Fig.7, A and B, shows similar dependence on the influence of the other damage for excision of the damages to give single- and double-strand breaks. Only oligonucleotide −5 has fewer double-strand breaks in comparison with the level of single-strand break. This is probably due to the fact that the 5 base pairs, between the two single-strands breaks, are not properly dehybridized in the sample and during the migration. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the largest inhibitory effect for Fpg excision of DHT occurs when an AP site is positioned opposite to the DHT of interest. This inhibition is asymmetrical and is greatest when the AP site is positioned 3 or 1 bases 3′ to the DHT (positions −3 and −1) with 50- and 43-fold inhibition, respectively. In contrast to the results with Nth, the removal of DHT by Fpg is also inhibited 8.4–12.2-fold by the presence of uracil located between 5 bases 3′ to 5 bases 5′ of the DHT on the opposite strand, as presented in Fig. 8 B. The presence of an 8-oxoG opposite to the DHT also has an inhibitory effect and is maximum when 8-oxoG in positioned at 3 bases 3′ or 5′ of the DHT (positions −3 and +3 in Fig. 8 D, respectively). In contrast, the presence of another DHT or an 8-oxoA, 1 base 5′ (position +1, Fig.8 C) and 1 base 3′ to the DHT (position −1, Fig.8 E), respectively, on the labeled strand gives 2.1- and 3.6-fold activation. No effect was seen when DHT or 8-oxoA is present at any other site opposite to the DHT of interest. By using double labeling probes containing an AP site opposite to DHT, the same level of DHT or AP site was excised by Nth or Fpg as that observed with the singly labeling probes described above (Figs.2 D and 6 A and Figs. 3 D and8 A). In the same way, identical results were obtained using 5′-32P-labeled probes on the DHT-containing strand that was hybridized to the complementary oligonucleotides containing an AP site with either a 5′-OH or a 5′-P termini. These results suggest that the presence of 5′ OH or 5′-P termini does not change the inhibitory effect of the presence of an AP site on the excision of DHT by Nth or Fpg. As with the purified Nth and Fpg proteins, the presence of an AP site opposite to a DHT causes a large decrease of the efficiency of the excision of DHT by the XRS5 nuclear extract (Fig.9 A). In contrast to the findings with Nth and Fpg (Figs. 6 A and 8 A, respectively), the effect is symmetric. The largest inhibition is seen when the AP site is 5 bases 3′ or 5′ of the DHT (positions −5 and +5 in Fig. 9 A), and the inhibition is less when the AP site is at positions −1 and +1 to DHT (Fig. 9 A). The effect of uracil on DHT excision (Fig. 9 B) gives the same inhibitory profile as that of an AP site, but the level of inhibition is significantly less. The presence of either another DHT or 8-oxoG does not have any significant effect on the action of the nuclear extracts (Fig. 9, C and D). However, it is worth noting that, as for the incubation with Fpg (Fig. 8 D), the profile of the effect in the presence of 8-oxoG is the same but less efficient when incubated with nuclear extract (Fig. 9 D). The only significant effect of 8-oxoA is when positioned 1 base 3′ (position−1, Fig. 9 E) opposite to the DHT, giving a 2.1-fold inhibition. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of neighboring DNA damage on the excision of a specific DNA damage to gain an insight into the effects of clustered DNA damage on DNA damage repair. Purified proteins involved in the DNA damage recognition and excision and nuclear extracts, as a composite of the cellular proteins, were used to assess how such clustered damage may compromise their efficiency to be repaired in cells even though the individual damages are readily processed (Fig. 1). This study is the first to assess the recognition and processing of complex damage by cell extracts, as a more complex model of repair, and compare the effects with base excision repair enzymes, used as benchmarks. For instance, the AP lyase activity of Nth and Fpg is about 1 order of magnitude greater than their glycosylase activities when comparing the cleavage of an AP site with that for excision of a base damage. The cleavage of an AP site by the extract was also more efficient than cleavage as a result of excision of the base damages. These effects are similar to those using Fpg, but quantitatively, the differences are greater with the extracts. This difference may reflect that only a few proteins are able to excise 8-oxoG such as Fpg or OGG1 proteins in the cellular environment (34.Girard P.-M. Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in comparison with the larger number of proteins that remove AP sites from DNA. The differences between the AP site and the excision of uracil (70-fold) is probably due to the presence of uracil-DNA-glycosylase in the nuclear extracts that convert uracil into an AP site that is subsequently cleaved by proteins. With the purified proteins, the end group termini (data not shown) are consistent with the AP lyase activity of Nth involving a β-elimination process as described by Bailly and Verly (35.Bailly V. Verly W.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The 3′ OH end termini produced by cleavage of AP sites by the nuclear extract are consistent with the clean up of the end termini. The biggest effect on the efficiency of cleavage of an AP site, reflecting the AP lyase activity, by Nth, Fpg, and XRS5 nuclear extracts is the presence of a neighboring AP site on the complementary strand. The large inhibition (<4-fold) of the AP lyase activity occurs with Fpg when another AP site is situated from −5 to +8 of the AP site monitored (Figs. 3 A and 5 B). The cleavage of an AP site by Nth is only affected by an immediately neighboring AP site. The cleavage of an AP site by Nth, Fpg, and extract is not greatly affected by the presence of a vicinal base damage, DHT, 8-oxoG, and 8-oxoA. For nuclear extracts, the efficiency of cleavage of an AP site is enhanced when another AP site is positioned opposite at +1, +3, and +5 and is not significantly dependent on the sequence context as demonstrated in Fig. 5. The major inhibition (>50-fold), however, is seen on conversion of DHT into a single-strand break by Nth or Fpg (see below for DHT excision by Fpg) when an AP site is on the opposite strand and the influence extends over several base pairs of separation (Figs. 6 A and8 A). Since the inhibitory effect of a neighboring AP site on excision of DHT is greater than on cleavage of an AP site, it is suggested that the AP site on the nonlabeled strand is rapidly converted into a single-strand break since both Nth and Fpg are more efficient at cleavage of an AP site than excision of DHT (Fig. 1,B and C). From comparison of the yields of single-strand and double-strand breaks (Fig. 7) following Nth excision of DHT, it is apparent that inhibition of double-strand break formation is of the same magnitude and trend as that for formation of a single-strand break. Therefore, it is suggested that a single-strand break on the non-labeled complementary strand at the AP site position is already formed prior to removal of the DHT. This finding is comparable with that for the removal of thymine glycol opposite a gap by Nth (10.Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effect of an AP site on the excision of thymine glycol is symmetrical in contrast to the asymmetry seen for excision of DHT opposite to an AP site by Nth. In contrast to the large inhibition by an AP site on DHT excision, the majority of the inhibition of an opposing base damage (DHT, 8-oxoA, 8-oxoG) or uracil by Nth occurs when the second damage is at +1 site of the DHT of interest. The lack of effect of 8-oxoG on the excision of DHT on the opposite strand, consistent with previous studies (10.Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), is when 8-oxoG is more than 1 base 5′ or at every position 3′ to the DHT on the complementary strand (Fig. 6 D). The asymmetrical effects observed may be correlated to the asymmetrical binding of Nth to the strand opposite to the recognized damage. Indeed, DNase I footprinting experiments (36.O'Handley S. Scholes C.P. Cunningham R.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) show that Nth protects an AP site from 4 bases 3′ to 4 bases 5′ on the AP-containing strand and, on the complementary strand, from 1 base 3′ to 9 bases 5′ from the AP site. During the course of this study, it became apparent that DHT is a substrate for the Fpg protein (Fig. 1 C, see Ref. 37.D'Ham C. Romieu A. Jaquinod M. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3335-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that usually recognizes purine damages, although some pyrimidine damages such as 5-hydroxycytosine and 5′hydroxyuracil have previously been shown to be substrates for Fpg (20.Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the finding with Nth, the inhibitory effect on DHT excision of a neighboring base damage by Fpg is significantly less than that for the neighboring AP site. With Fpg, the largest effect on inhibition of the excision of DHT occurs when an AP site is positioned 3′ to the DHT on the opposite strand with up to 50-fold inhibition. This effect is asymmetric, but the asymmetry is not related to the binding motif of Fpg that protects an AP site from DNase I footprinting by binding 2 bases 3′ and 5′ of the AP site but only one base opposite the AP site on the complementary strand (38.Tchou J. Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26738-26744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,39.Castaing B. Fourrey J.-L. Hervouet N. Thomas M. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The influence of other damages is much more variable than that obtained with Nth. In particular, the presence of a uracil on the opposite strand has a 8.4–12.2-fold inhibitory effect on DHT excision by Fpg (Fig. 8 B) but no effect on DHT excision by Nth (Fig.6 B). This inhibition could allow the action of the Ung protein to form an abasic site that will be quickly converted into a single-strand break. After repair of this break, the Fpg protein can then act more efficiently on the DHT opposite a normal strand. With XRS5 nuclear extracts, the major effect on excision of a DHT is the presence of an AP site (Fig. 9 A) or uracil (Fig.9 B), in contrast to the small effects seen with either a neighboring DHT, 8-oxoG, or 8-oxoA. In contrast to the purified enzymes, the largest inhibitory effects of a vicinal damage are seen on base damage excision and not on cleavage of an AP site. The effect of uracil on the excision of DHT by XRS5 nuclear extracts gives a similar pattern to that for the influence of an AP site on DHT removal, which does not show an asymmetrical response as observed using both Nth and Fpg. It is suggested that the effect of nuclear extract is much more complicated and results from a combination of effects of the enzymes that remove AP sites from DNA. The effect of 8-oxoG on cleavage of an AP site by the nuclear extract gives the same qualitative dependence as that with Fpg. This suggests that the effect with nuclear extracts might be due to the combined effects of an Fpg-like protein and Nth to give the lower inhibition. It is of interest that certain clustered damages could give an increased efficiency of excision of a base damage within the cluster. This is particularly apparent for a DHT 1 base 5′ or an 8-oxoA 1 base 3′ to DHT on the complementary strand with Fpg and an AP site 1 base up to 5 bases from another AP site with XRS5 nuclear extracts. It is suggested that the big inhibitory effect of an opposite AP site on DHT recognition by all the proteins tested may minimize the probability of formation of a double-strand break so that the repair enzymes have time to rejoin the gap, generated at the AP site, prior to excision of DHT from the opposite strand. Therefore, it will be on interest to test further these combinations of clustered damages to determine if they increase the probability to give a double-strand break and how they affect the repairability of the damaged base, particularly with nuclear extracts."

To further explore the roles of PAK1 in the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells, in the present study we investigated the influence of inhibition of PAK1 activity on the reorganization of cytoskeleton components that control motility and invasiveness of cells, using a highly invasive breast cancer MDA-MB435 as a model system. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of a kinase dead K299R PAK1 mutant leads to suppression of motile phenotypes as well as invasiveness of cells both in the absence or presence of exogenous heregulin-β1. In addition, these phenotypic changes were accompanied by a blockade of disassembly of focal adhesion points, stabilization of stress fibers, and enhanced cell spreading and were dependent on the presence of the kinase dead domain but independent of the presence of the Rac/cdc42 intact (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain of PAK1. We also demonstrated that in K299R PAK1-expressing cells, F-actin filaments were stabilized by persistent co-localization with the actin-binding proteins tropomyosin and caldesmon. Extension of these studies to invasive breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells illustrated that conditional expression of kinase-defective K299R PAK1 was also accompanied by persistent cell spreading, multiple focal adhesion points, and reduced invasiveness. Furthermore, inhibition of PAK1 activity in breast cancer cells was associated with a reduction in c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity, inhibition of DNA binding activity of transcription factor AP-1, and suppression of in vivo transcription driven by AP-1 promoter (known to be involved in breast cancer invasion). These findings suggest that PAK1 downstream pathways have a role in the development and maintenance of invasive phenotypes in breast cancer cells.

Localized breast cancer prior to metastasis can be cured by surgery. The high mortality rate associated with breast cancer, however, is related to its ability to metastasize beyond the mammary gland and invade distant sites while the primary tumor is small and undetected. Thus, tumor cell migration/invasion is an important factor in formation of solid tumors and is necessary for their spread to distinct organs. The process of malignancy requires, among other steps, changes in growth factor pathways and increased migration. The exposure of cells to growth factors has been shown to cause cytoskeleton reorganization, formation of lamellipodia, membrane ruffling, and altered cell morphology, and accordingly, such exposure is implicated in stimulating cell migration and invasion (1.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic cells possess the capacity to move over or through a substrate, and cell migration plays a key role in both normal physiology and in a disease setting, including invasion and metastasis (2.Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In many tissues, the motility function of cells is normally repressed but can be activated by appropriate stimuli, oncogenic transformation, or both. In fact, one of the earliest responses of cells to many extracellular growth factors is rapid reorganization of their cytoskeleton and cell shape. The leading edge of a motile cell is composed of thin protrusions of membrane that continuously extend and retract mediating the initial stage of cell movement and determining the direction of advance. The underlying cytoskeleton of a leading edge is composed of actin-filament bundles (in filopodia) or meshworks (in lamellipodia) oriented toward the membrane (3.Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Cell migration also involves changes in cytoskeleton actin stress fibers that end in focal adhesions, which are places where the plasma membrane is attached to the substratum. Focal adhesions are specialized sites of adhesion for cells in culture associated with well defined actin stress fibers, and they represent the link between the outside extracellular matrix components and the cytoplasmic integrins coupled with cytoskeletal proteins. Numerous proteins involved in signal transduction are known to be concentrated at these sites. According to a recent model, intracellular components of the focal adhesion complex and actin filaments associate with integrins upon integrin engagement with the extracellular matrix. In the presence of active Rho, these complexes and actin cluster together by actin-myosin contraction, which leads to focal adhesion and stress fiber formation. The focal adhesion points play an important role in the regulation of cell motility, which involves cyclic formation of cell adhesion and disassembly of actin filaments and focal adhesion complexes (1.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar).The small GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, have been implicated in the regulation of morphology, the formation of filopodia/lamellopodia, membrane ruffles, and stress fibers, and motility of mammalian cells (1.Hall A.

More specifically, Rac1 induces cortical actin polymerization seen as the process of membrane ruffling and lamellipodia (4.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). RhoA induces stress fiber formation possibly by catalyzing the formation of focal adhesion (5.Ridley A. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar), and cdc42 induces the formation of peripheral actin microspikes and filopodia (6.Kozma R,. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). With regard to the mechanism by which the small GTPases initiate and regulate the formation of cytoskeletal structures, recently a family of serine/theonine kinases known as p21-activated kinases (PAKs)1 have been identified as GTPase targets (7.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Activation of PAK1 has been shown to result in phenotypic changes reminiscent of those produced by GTPases. If activated either by overexpression of dominant active PAK1 mutants or by stimulation of cells with growth factors, PAK1 causes the accumulation of F-actin and the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. Furthermore, activated PAK1 has been also shown to be co-localized with F-actin at the leading edge of the cells (7.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 8.Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Activation of PAK1 has been shown to be accompanied by the disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (9.Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen G. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are widely believed to be required for increased motility. Because PAK1 is a downstream target of cdc42 and Rac1, which are known to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase, JNK, p38 kinases, and the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (10.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 11.Minden A. Lin A.,. Claret F.X. Abo A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that PAK1 or a related kinase may mediate the actions of cdc42 and Rac1. Indeed, PAK1 has been shown to activate JNK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases (13.Brown J.L. Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14.Yablonski D. Kane L.P. Quian D. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5647-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Invasion of T-lymphocytes and fibroblast has been shown to involve activated Rac1 and Tiam-1 (15.Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 25: 338-340Crossref Scopus (506) Google Scholar), a Rac1 exchange factor. In addition to the PAK1-JNK pathway, other effectors for Rac1 such as POR1 have also been implicated in actin rearrangements (16.Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17.Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V.

Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) showed that PAK1 as well as JNK1 activities are not required to induce motility and invasion in cells that are overexpressing active mutants of Rac1. These studies dissociate Cdc42 and Rac1-induced actin polymerization (ruffles formation) from PAK and JNK activation, raising the possibility of existence of a divergent pathway, which involves another Rac1 effector, POR1. It was shown that Rac1 mutants that are capable of binding PAK1 but not POR1 (and thus activate JNK) are also able to induce a motile phenotytpe in these cells (16.Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the same Rac mutants behave in an opposite manner when used in different cell systems (17.Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).It is increasingly accepted that alterations in the reorganization and stability of actin filaments may contribute to increased cell migration and to cell transformation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasiveness. Tropomyosin (TM) and caldesmon (CaD) are two essential proteins required for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton mediated by stabilization of microfilaments (18.Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Tanaka J. Waranabe T. Nakamura N. Sobue K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 595-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although TM was initially discovered as a helical protein that binds to actin grooves in muscle, it is now clear that Ca2+-dependent contractility in nonmuscle cells is also controlled by TM in conjunction with CaD (20.Huber P.A. Fraser I.D. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CaD is an actin- and calmodulin-binding protein that is distributed at intervals along stress fibers (18.Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown relationships between 1) overexpression of CaD and the stabilization of actin microfilament bundles by enhancing the half-life of TM (22.Warren K.S. Shutt D.C. McDermott J.P. Lin J.L. Soll D.R. Lin J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); 2) suppression of TM1 and the anchorage-independent growth of hamster embryo cells (23.Boyd J. Risinger J.I. Wiseman R.W. Merrick B.A.,. Selkirk J.K. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11534-11538Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); 3) modulation of the TM isoforms and tumorigenic transformation (24.Franzen B. Linder S. Alaiya A.A. Eriksson E. Fujioka K.,. Bergman A.C. Jornvall H. Auer G. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25.Bhattacharya B. Prasad G.L. Valverius E.M. Salomon D.S. Cooper H.L. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2105-2112PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) CaD/v-erbB interaction and actin stress fiber disassembly (26.McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite the widely acknowledged roles of TM and CaD on one hand and PAK1 on the other hand in actin stabilization, the potential relationship between these cytoskeleton regulators and invasiveness remains elusive.Recently, we showed that stimulation of a noninvasive human breast cancer cell by heregulin leads to the activation of PAK1 kinases, redistribution of PAK1 at the leading edges of cells, development of lamellipodia/filopodia and stress fibers, and increased invasiveness of breast cancer cells (27.Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chernoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of PAK1 in the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells, in this study we investigated the influence of suppression of the PAK1 activity on the reorganization of cytoskeleton components that control motility and in vitro invasiveness of cells using the highly invasive MDA-MB435 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell model systems. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of catalytically defective K299R PAK1 leads to biogenesis of stable focal adhesions and stress fibers with matrix-independent enhanced cell attachment and spreading properties. All these biological effects were dependent on the presence of the kinase defective site and independent on the presence of an intact Rac/cdc42 binding domain. In addition, these phenotypic changes were accompanied by persistent suppression of JNK activity, DNA binding activity of transcription factor AP-1, and in vivotranscription driven by collagenase promoter. These findings suggest that the PAK1-dependent pathway have a role in the maintenance of invasive behavior of breast cancer cells.DISCUSSIONBreast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in western countries. The high mortality rate associated with breast cancer, however, is related to its ability to metastasize beyond the mammary gland and invade distant sites, whereas the primary tumor is small and undetected. Thus, tumor cell migration/invasion is an important factor in the formation of solid tumors, and it is necessary for their spread to distinct organs. The progression of breast cancer cells to a more invasive phenotype is believed to be influenced by the migration of cells from the primary site of tumor, incorporating the ability of cancer cells to invade through basement membrane and reestablish themselves at distant sites. Because a successful invasion and metastasis of breast tumor is conditional for cell migration from the primary tumor, cell motility must play a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells. Therefore, understanding cell motility is likely to delineate pathways that may be an integral part of metastasis. Recently, we showed that PAK1 had a role in cell motility and invasiveness of human breast cancer cells stimulated by heregulin-β1 (27.Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chernoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of PAK1 in the reorganization of cytoskeleton components that control motility and in vitro invasiveness of cells, here we investigated the influence of inhibition of PAK1 activity on the modulation of invasive phenotypes in breast cancer cells. We utilized two distinct highly invasive breast cancer cell model systems, one involving stable overexpression of kinase dead K299R PAK1 in MDA-MB435 cells and another where there is a conditional regulation of the expression of K299R PAK1 in MDA-MB231 cells.The results presented here indicate that overexpression of kinase dead PAK1 in invasive breast cancer cells leads to significant morphological changes and reduction of in vitro invasiveness. Our conclusion that suppression of PAK1 activity modulated the invasion of breast cancer cells was supported by the following lines of evidence: (i) expression of K299R PAK1 mutant blocked the transmigration of cells across a porous membrane, (ii) K299R PAK1 mutant blocked the formation of ruffles and filopodia induced by other stimuli, (iii) inhibition of PAK1 by K299R was accompanied by persistent cell spreading and an increase in the number and maturity of the focal complexes, (iv) K299R expression resulted in the appearance of thicker actin cables with prolonged co-localization of tropomyosin or caldesmon, and (v) the K299R PAK1-mediated blockade of ruffles and filopodia formation and of migration could not be reversed by HRG. Taken together, these data provide evidence that PAK1-regulated reorganization of cytoskeleton structures may be required to maintain the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells.Among the various pathways leading to actin reorganization, the Rho subfamily of the small GTPases, cdc42 and Rac1, has been implicated in the regulation of morphology and motility of mammalian cells. Recent studies have identified the PAKs as a target of activated GTPases, as activation of PAK1 has been shown to result in the phenotypic changes reminiscent of those produced by Rac and/or cdc42 (36.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Li L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a role of PAK in promoting cell migration has been also suggested by the physical interaction between PAK1 and actin in response to upstream stimuli (7.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 27.Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chernoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The propensity of malignant breast cancer cells to invade must depend on their ability to migrate from the primary tumor site. Our observation that kinase dead PAK1 predominantly localizes to the fairly stable focal points supports a role for PAK1 in promoting cell motility, probably by its known function to dissolve the focal adhesions (31.Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, because the K299R kinase dead PAK1 mutant still contains binding sites for Rac/cdc42, which are known to promote phenotypic changes similar to those caused by PAK1, it is possible that the observed effects could have been reflections of ineffective transduction of Rac/cdc42 signals. However, transfection of double PAK1 mutant H83, 86L, K299R (which has mutation in CRIB site and PAK1 kinase domain) also demonstrated increased actin bundling, cell spreading,and stabilization of focal points. Furthermore, expression of the PAK1 autoinhibitory domain (PAK 83–149) also exhibited changes in cell shape (to a lesser degree) similar to K299R PAK1. Taken together, these results indicated that PAK1 kinase activity is involved in the cell shape changes, increased focal points and F-actin bundling in MDA-MB-435 cells. These findings suggest a role of PAK1 kinase activity in the motility of human epithelial cancer cells.Recently, kinase active PAK1 has been shown to cause excessive dissolution of focal adhesions and stress fibers (9.Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen G. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and directional haptotaxis in fibroblasts (8.Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Another notable finding in this study was the essential role of PAK1 in actin dynamics, as catalytically inactive PAK1 may impair the formation of dynamic actin-containing structures necessary for cell migration and the formation of the focal points. Some of the possible mechanisms for the observed decreased migration potential may include a change in F-actin conformation induced by increasing the actin bundling or stability or blocking the F-actin capping. Caldesmon and tropomyosin are two major actin-binding proteins that can modulate the stability of actin filament (32.Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that caldesmon coupled with tropomyosin not only blocks the binding of human fascin to actin (37.Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Kohama K. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26991-26997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but also dissociates fascin from actin (38.Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4655-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that caldesmon together with tropomyosin regulates the assembly of actin bundles. There is also an increasing body of evidence showing that caldesmon stabilizes microfilaments in nonmuscle cells (33.Matsumura F. Yamashiro S Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), probably by increasing actin binding of tropomyosin (39.Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Novy R.E. Lin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16917-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In nonmuscle cells, caldesmon, an actin-binding protein, may have important regulatory functions in cell motility, analogous to those suggested for the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. Dissociation of caldesmon from microfilaments may destabilize the structure of microfilaments. Something similar may happen during cell motility where there is a dramatic cytoskeleton rearrangement of the stress fibers connecting the cells in the focal points (attachment and spreading) with subsequent dissolution and reformation of more dynamic actin-containing structures such as ruffles and lamellopodias. It remains to be established how PAK1 contributes to the interaction of the actin with tropomyosin and caldesmon. Several substrates have been recently found to be phosphorylated by different members of the PAK family with functional impact on the contraction properties of actin filaments. More contraction of actin filaments (stress fibers) causes less motility in nonmuscle cells (41.Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that PAK3 is able to phosphorylate caldesmon independently of the induction of muscle contraction (42.Van Eyk J.E. Arrell D.K. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Heinonen T.Y.K. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Cote G.P. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23433-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Evidence also suggests that myosin light chain kinase binds to cellular actin filaments and is localized to actinomyosin-containing stress fibers in nonmuscle cells. In a very elegant study on smooth muscle cells that used GFP-labeled myosin light chain kinase the filament-bound kinase was shown to be sufficient for Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain and contraction of stress fiber (43.Lin P.-J. Luby-Phelps K. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the recently identified PAK1 substrates is indeed myosin light chain kinase, and its phosphorylation by PAK1 in vitro andin vivo was shown to decrease myosin light chain activity, leading to a decrease in cell spreading and thus less actin-myosin contraction (44.Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Our finding that the kinase dead mutant K299R PAK1 increased the cell spreading and the appearance of stress fibers suggests a possible role of PAK1 in microfilaments remodeling via the myosin light chain kinase pathway. However our results do not distinguish if these effects are because of the increase in actin-myosin contraction, stabilization of actin by actin-binding proteins, or both. Future studies will be needed to determine the precise nature of interplay between Rac, cdc42, and RhoA effectors in these processes.The evidence that overexpression of the kinase dead K299R PAK1 mutant in breast cancer cells has the capacity to inhibit the DNA binding activity and of AP-1-dependent transcription in vivo is of special interest, as it strongly suggests that PAK1-induced signaling may modulate the expression of genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (45.Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar), which are relevant for invasion via the AP-1-dependent pathway. This hypothesis is further supported by our preliminary studies showing a reduction of gelatinolytic activity in the conditioned medium that had K299R PAK1-overexpressing MDA-MB435 cells (data not shown). Because PAK1 is considered to be an activator of JNK and p38 MAPK (46.Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), it is possible that the JNK/p38 downstream events influence the expression of gene products with functions in motility/invasion of breast cancer cells. Taken together, our findings of regulation of actin reorganization, cell migration and invasion, and gene regulation functions of breast cancer cells by PAK1 open a new avenue of investigation closely linking PAK1, cytoskeleton-signaling, transcription of genes involved in metastasis, and breast cancer invasiveness. In addition, our present finding may lead to strategies targeting PAK1 as a potential inhibitor of invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the United States, affecting one in nine women. Localized breast cancer prior to metastasis can be cured by surgery. The high mortality rate associated with breast cancer, however, is related to its ability to metastasize beyond the mammary gland and invade distant sites while the primary tumor is small and undetected. Thus, tumor cell migration/invasion is an important factor in formation of solid tumors and is necessary for their spread to distinct organs. The process of malignancy requires, among other steps, changes in growth factor pathways and increased migration. The exposure of cells to growth factors has been shown to cause cytoskeleton reorganization, formation of lamellipodia, membrane ruffling, and altered cell morphology, and accordingly, such exposure is implicated in stimulating cell migration"

To clarify the differences between tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and Fas pathways in hepatocyte apoptosis, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with TNFα or an agonist anti-Fas antibody after infection with an adenovirus expressing an IκB superrepressor (Ad5IκB). Treatment with TNFα induced apoptosis in Ad5IκB-infected mouse hepatocytes, as we previously reported for rat hepatocytes. Ad5IκB plus anti-Fas antibody or actinomycin D plus anti-Fas antibody rapidly induced apoptosis, whereas anti-Fas antibody alone produced little cytotoxicity. The proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) and a dominant-negative mutant of nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase also promoted TNFα- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. Expression of either crmA or a dominant-negative mutant of the Fas-associated death domain protein prevented TNFα- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. In addition, the caspase inhibitors, DEVD-cho and IETD-fmk, inhibited TNFα- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. In Ad5IκB-infected hepatocytes, caspases-3 and -8 were activated within 2 h after treatment with anti-Fas antibody or within 6 h after TNFα treatment. Confocal microscopy demonstrated onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and mitochondrial depolarization by 2–3 h after anti-Fas antibody treatment and 8–10 h after TNFα treatment, followed by cytochromec release. The combination of the MPT inhibitors, cyclosporin A, and trifluoperazine, protected Ad5IκB-infected hepatocytes from TNFα-mediated apoptosis. After anti-Fas antibody, cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine decreased cytochrome crelease but did not prevent caspase-3 activation and cell-death. In conclusion, nuclear factor-κB activation protects mouse hepatocytes against both TNFα- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. TNFα and Fas recruit similar but nonidentical, pathways signaling apoptosis. The MPT is obligatory for TNFα-induced apoptosis. In Fas-mediated apoptosis, the MPT accelerates the apoptogenic events but is not obligatory for them.

Two death factors, Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα),1 bind to their receptors and induce apoptosis, killing the cells within hours (1.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). Apoptosis controlled by such death receptor pairs can cause tissue destruction (2.Ogasawara J.

Hepatocyte apoptosis, mainly induced by death domain receptor ligands such as Fas ligand and TNFα, is implicated in several experimental and human liver diseases including viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, acute liver failure, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diseases of the bile ducts, graft-versus-host disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (3.Galle P.R. Krammer P.H. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The TNF receptor family includes Fas, the receptor for Fas ligand, and the two TNFα receptors (TNFR) (1.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). Upon binding to Fas ligand, Fas forms a complex with the associated protein, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), which directly binds and activates caspase-8. Recent studies showed that FLICE-associated huge protein interacts with FADD and caspase-8 (4.Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). FLICE-associated huge protein may control apoptosis at the level of caspase activation. TNFR1 interacts with the adaptor protein TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) that recruits FADD, which again directly activates caspase-8. TNFα also induces other signaling pathways via TRADD including the protein kinase receptor interacting protein and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). TNFα activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), via either protein kinase receptor interacting protein or TRAF2 (5.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P.

Recent studies indicate that NF-κB activation by TNFα protects cells from TNF cytotoxicity (13.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 14.Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). TNFα binding to the TNF receptor potentially both initiates apoptosis and activates NF-κB, which suppresses apoptosis by induction of NF-κB-responsive genes, including TRAF1, TRAF2, and the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (16.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). The expression of the IκB superrepressor by an IκBα (S32A, S36A)-expressing adenovirus (Ad5IκB), which blocks NF-κB activation, sensitizes primary rat hepatocytes to TNFα-mediated apoptosis (17.Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNFα-mediated cytotoxicity is enhanced by the addition of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis (cyclohexamide and actinomycin D) (18.Leist M. Gantner F. Jilg S. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1307-1316PubMed Google Scholar). Fas induces NF-κB binding activity in certain, but not all, cell types. Fas can stimulate the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in a variety of tumor cells irrespective of their sensitivity or resistance to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity (19.Ponton A. Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Another report showed that the activation of NF-κB can induce target gene expression that rescues TNFα- but not Fas-mediated apoptosis in T24 cell lines (13.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). However, whether NF-κB is activated in Fas-mediated apoptosis in nontumor cells, such as hepatocytes, is not clear. Anti-Fas antibody injection into mice induces severe liver failure with apoptosis of hepatocytes (2.Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). However, anti-Fas antibody alone induces apoptosis in less than 20% of the cultured hepatocytes in vitro, whereas all cells were killed by anti-Fas antibody in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide (20.Ni R. Tomita Y. Matsuda K. Ichihara A. Ishimura K. Ogasawara J. Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21.Rouquet N. Carlier K. Briand P. Wiels J. Joulin V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cultured mouse hepatocytes may express protective proteins against apoptosis. Furthermore, Fas-mediated apoptosis was delayed in hepatocytes during liver regeneration in mice (22.Takehara T. Hayashi N. Mita E. Kanto T. Tatsumi T. Sasaki Y. Kasahara A. Hori M. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This suggests that TNFα may act as one of the protective factors against Fas-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis, because initiation of liver regeneration requires TNFα. Perhaps TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB protects hepatocytes from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Mitochondria play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis (23.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 25.Reed J.C.

Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, which is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family, causes the release of soluble proteins, such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, from the intermembrane space. Inhibitors of MPT pore opening, including cyclosporin A (CsA), block apoptosis in some systems (27.Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Masse B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 28.Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The MPT is an essential component in the signaling pathways in TNFα-mediated cytotoxicity in the L929 line of mouse fibroblast (29.Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and TNFα-induced apoptosis in rat hepatocytes (17.Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins reside in mitochondria and can prevent the MPT. Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 prevented the release of cytochromec, yet other aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction still transpired and cells died (30.Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), suggesting that the release of cytochrome c may not be required for cell death. Some studies using nonhepatic cells demonstrate that the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol does not require a mitochondrial transmembrane depolarization (31.Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 32.Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 33.Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), whereas others show that mitochondrial depolarization accompanies cytochromec release (34.Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.W. Ma J. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondrial involvement and the role of cytochrome c and MPT in apoptosis are still controversial. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the differences between Fas and TNFα pathways in hepatocyte apoptosis and the roles of NF-κB activation and MPT in Fas-mediated apoptosis. The results show that NF-κB activation has a protective role in not only TNFα- but also Fas-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Fas agonistic antibody induces the MPT, which accelerates apoptosis, but is not essential for it. About 8-week-old C57Bl6 male mice were anesthetized with ketamine/acepromazine malate administered by intraperitoneal injection. Hepatocytes were then isolated by a retrograde, nonrecirculating in situ collagenase perfusion of livers cannulating through the inferior vena cava by a procedure modified from Moldeus et al. (35.Moldeus P. Hogberg J. Orrenius S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Livers were first perfused in situ with an oxygenated 0.5 mm EGTA containing calcium-free salt solution (8 ml/min, 37 °C for 5 min), followed by perfusion with solution containing 0.04% collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min. The liver was then gently minced on a Petri dish and filtered with polyamide mesh (I 003 Y NITEX 3–60/45, TETKO Inc., NY). Hepatocytes were washed two times and centrifuged at 50 × g for 2 min. Cell viability was consistently >90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Hepatocyte cultures contained less than 1% Kupffer cells and the stellate cells as determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled latex beads (1 μm, Polysciences, Warrington, PA) and autofluorescence, respectively. 5 × 105 cells were plated on 6-well plates coated with mouse collagen type I in Waymouth's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 μm insulin, and 0.1 μmdexamethazone. 1.5 × 106, 2.5 × 106, or 8 × 106 cells were plated on a 60-, 100-, or 150-mm dish, respectively. After 2 h, the culture was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and changed to hormonally defined medium (HDM) containing 0.1 μm insulin, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 3 μm selenium, and 10 nm free fatty acids in RPMI basal medium. Cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses in HDM containing 30 plaque-forming units/cell for 2 h at 37 °C and then changed to HDM containing recombinant murine TNFα (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), Jo-2 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), or other treatments. All animals received humane care in compliance with the guidelines of the University of North Carolina. The adenovirus 5 variants Ad5IκB, Ad5LacZ, Ad5ΔFADD and Ad5crmA, expressing HA-IκBα (S32A, S36A), β-galactosidase, a truncated form of FADD, and crmA, respectively, have been described elsewhere (17.Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 36.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The Ad5 vector expressing ΔNIK (Ad5Δ NIK) was constructed by cre-lox recombination as described (37.Anton M. Graham F.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4600-4606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An insert from pCDNA-HA2101 (deletion of amino acids 1–623, a gift from Dr. G. Natoli) (6.Natoli G. Costanzo A. Moretti F. Fulco M. Balsano C. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26079-26082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the shuttle vector pAdlox using standard techniques, and the construct was confirmed by restriction digests. Expression of the ΔNIK construct was confirmed with a luciferase reporter gene assay in monkey kidney fibroblasts (COS-7, ATCC-CRL-1651, American Type Culture Collections) as described previously (36.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and Western blotting using a mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA). Briefly, When COS cells reached subconfluence on 6-well culture plates, the cells were transfected with 3 μg of DNA and 1 μg of (κB)3-Luc, a reporter plasmid containing three copies of the NF-κB binding site (38.Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four h after transfection, medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without 20 ng/ml of TNFα. After a 5-h incubation, cellular extracts were prepared using enhanced luciferase assay reagents (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). Some cells were infected with Ad5ΔNIK 24 h after transfection of (κB)3-Luc, were stimulated, and were harvested as described the above. For quantitation of cell viability (presented as mean ± S.E.), cells were infected and treated as described above. After 17–20 h of TNFα or Jo-2 treatment, cell viability was determined by exclusion of trypan blue. Viable cells were counted in three different 200× power fields, and the percentage of treated viable cells to untreated viable cells was determined as a percentage of control viability. For propidium iodide nuclear staining, cells were fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid, stained with 10 μg/ml popidium iodide, and viewed with an Olympus fluorescence microscope using a rhodamine filter set. Hepatocyte cell death was confirmed as apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacture's instructions. Positive (apoptotic) cells were counted in three different 200× power fields. To assess DNA ladder formation, 2 × 106 cells were digested overnight at 37 °C in 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.5% sarcosyl in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 10 μg of RNase for 1 h at 37 °C, gently extracted with phenol and chloroform, and analyzed on 2% agarose gels. Amino-4-trifluoromethyl courmarin (AFC) release assays for caspase-3 and -8 activities were performed using the FluorAce kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, whole cell lysates were combined with 25 μm z-DEVD-AFC or IETD-AFC (Enzyme and Systems Products, Livermore, CA) and were incubated 2 h at 37 °C. The change in fluorescence (excitation at 370 nm and emission at 490 nm) was monitored at 1-h intervals, converted to picomoles of AFC released by using a standard curve, and normalized for protein concentration. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from primary mouse hepatocytes as described previously (17.Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 36.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA binding reactions were carried out for 20 min on ice using 5 μg of nuclear extract and 32P-labeled DNA probes for the NF-κB consensus binding site (39.Bradham C.A. Stachlewitz R.F. Gao W. Qian T. Jayadev S. Jenkins G. Hannun Y. Lemasters J.J. Thurman R.G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Complexes were separated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gels and assayed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For supershift assays, 8 μg of antibody against p65 or p50 subunit of the NF-κB complex (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the reaction mixture, and the incubation time was extended for an additional 30 min. The preparation of cytosolic S100-fractions and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (17.Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, S-100 fractions were prepared from 8 × 106 hepatocytes by differential centrifugation in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose. Lysates containing 25 μg of protein was separated by electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide SDS gels and transferred into nitocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Equal loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Cytochromec was detected using primary monoclonal anti-cytochromec antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were detected with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell loading and confocal microscopy were carried out as described previously (40.Qian T. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1783-C1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 × 106 hepatocytes plated on collagen-coated 40-mm-diameter glass coverslips were infected with Ad5IκB in HDM supplemented with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) to stabilize pH during the confocal measurements. The cells were loaded with 250 nmtetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 1 μm calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) in Krebs Ringer-Hepes buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were mounted on a Nikon microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) in HDM-HEPES containing 100 nm TMRM, and the temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The first image (time point 0) was then recorded. Subsequently, TNFα or Jo-2 was added to the medium, and images were collected at given time-points. Calcein and TMRM fluorescence were excited with an argon laser through a double dichroic reflector at 488 and 568 nm, respectively. TMRM was imaged through a 590-nm-long path emission filter using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal system (Bio-Rad). Calcein fluorescence was collected through a 515–560-nm band path emission filter. A numerical aperture 1.4, 60× objective lens was used, and pinholes were set to 4 in both channels. Laser attenuation and power were set at 0.3% and low, respectively. Hepatocytes are resistant to TNFα-mediated apoptosis unless they are also treated with an inhibitor of protein synthesis (i.e. cycloheximide), RNA synthesis (i.e. actinomycin D) (18.Leist M. Gantner F. Jilg S. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1307-1316PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Leist M. Gantner F. Kunstle G. Bohlinger I. Tiegs G. Bluethmann H. Wendel A. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 109-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or NF-κB activity (i.e. an IκB superrepressor) (17.Bradham C.A. Qian T. Streetz K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To extend these studies into Fas-mediated apoptosis, we switched to primary cultures of adult mouse hepatocytes, because rat hepatocytes only express low levels of Fas (42.Fladmark K.E. Gjertsen B.T. Doskeland S.O. Vintermyr O.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TNFα alone had no cytotoxicity in primary mouse hepatocytes, but actinomycin D (ActD) plus TNFα caused massive cell death (Fig. 1, 16.2 ± 0.4%, % control viability at 17 h after treatment). Also, treatment of Ad5IκB-infected mouse hepatocytes expressing the IκB superrepressor with TNFα induced cell death (12.0 ± 1.1%). Cells expressing IκB superrepressor but not treated with TNFα did not lose viability. Furthermore, Ad5LacZ had a minimal effect on cell viability after TNFα treatment (82.0 ± 2.5%), compared with noninfected hepatocytes after TNFα. To study the role of NF-κB activation on Fas-mediated apoptosis, we treated cells with anti-Fas agonist-like antibody Jo2. Ad5IκB plus Jo2 (12.0 ± 1.2%) or ActD plus Jo2 (8.7 ± 0.9%) rapidly induced massive cell death, whereas Jo2 alone had low cytotoxicity (78.0 ± 11.5%). Furthermore, Jo2 did not induce significant cell death in Ad5LacZ-infected hepatocytes (75.0 ± 1.1%). The cytotoxic effects of Jo2 were dose-dependent in mouse hepatocytes expressing the IκB superrepressor (data not shown). The Ad5IκB-infected hepatocytes treated with Jo2 displayed nuclear condensation and fragmentation by propidium iodide staining, characteristic of apoptosis (Fig.2 A, lower panel), whereas uninfected cells displayed normal nuclear morphology after Jo2 treatment (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). To confirm hepatocyte death as apoptosis, TUNEL assay was performed. Although TUNEL positive cells were minimal after TNFα or Jo2 treatment, significant positive hepatocytes were observed after TNFα or Jo2 treatment in ActD-sensitized or Ad5IκB-infected hepatocytes (Fig.2 B). These results were consistent with cytotoxicity determined by the trypan blue extraction test. Furthermore, apoptosis was confirmed by the detection of fragmented chromosome DNA in infected cells after exposure to TNFα or Jo2 (Fig. 2 C). However, no DNA fragmentation was observed in the uninfected cells after Jo2 treatment. We also documented the role of the IκB/NFκB system in TNFα- and Fas-mediated apoptosis with a proteasome inhibitor, because proteasome inhibitors block IκBα degradation and reduce NF-κB activation (43.Jobin C. Hellerbrand C. Licato L.L. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. Gut. 1998; 42: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). MG-132, a potent and specific proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 1, MG-132 alone, 92.0 ± 4.6%), promotes TNFα- and Fas-mediated apoptosis (9.0 ± 3.6% and 0%, respectively). To examine whether Jo2 directly activates NF-κB, NF-κB DNA binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using an NF-κB binding site as probe. TNFα treatment for 30 min induced an increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity (2.2-fold increase,p < 0.001, versus untreated hepatocytes) (Fig. 3, A and B). Jo2 treatment also induced NF-κB binding activity (1.5-fold increase,p < 0.005, versus untreated hepatocytes), although to a less extent than TNFα. This activation was observed even at 15 min after Jo2 treatment with the peak at 30 min after Jo2 (data not shown). The NF-κB complex activated by Jo2 treatment of mouse hepatocytes was composed of p50-p65 dimers, as determined by supershifts (Fig. 3 A). These results show that TNFα and Jo2 activate NF-κB in mouse hepatocytes and blocking NF-κB sensitizes mouse hepatocytes to TNFα- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. NIK has been identified as a TRAF2-interacting protein that signals for NF-κB activation (5.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Adenovirus (Ad5ΔNIK)-mediated overexpression of the C-terminal NIK fragment (NIKΔ2101) impaired the induction of NF-κB by TNFα in a reporter gene assay in COS cells (Fig. 3 C). HA-tagged ΔNIK was expressed in primary mouse hepatocytes by infection of Ad5ΔNIK at 10, 30, and 50 m.o.i. (Fig.3 D). Dominant-negative expression of NIK sensitized mouse hepatocytes to TNFα- and Fas-mediated cell de"
https://openalex.org/W1986909201,"Cubilin has recently been shown to function as an endocytic receptor for high density lipoproteins (HDL). The lack of apparent transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains in cubilin raises questions as to the means by which it can mediate endocytosis. Since cubilin has been reported to bind the endocytic receptor megalin, we explored the possibility that megalin acts in conjunction with cubilin to mediate HDL endocytosis. While megalin did not bind to HDL, delipidated HDL, or apoA-I, it was found to copurify with cubilin isolated by HDL-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Cubilin and megalin exhibited coincident patterns of mRNA expression in mouse tissues including the kidney, ileum, thymus, placenta, and yolk sac endoderm. The expression of both receptors in yolk sac endoderm-like cells was inducible by retinoic acid treatment but not by conditions of sterol depletion. Suppression of megalin activity or expression by treatment with either megalin antibodies or megalin antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in inhibition of cubilin-mediated endocytosis of HDL. Furthermore, megalin antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment resulted in reduced cell surface expression of cubilin. These data demonstrate that megalin acts together with cubilin to mediate HDL endocytosis and further suggest that megalin may play a role in the intracellular trafficking of cubilin.

It is not clear how such a “peripheral” association allows interaction of cubilin with cytosolic components of the endocytic machinery. A plausible hypothesis is that an integral membrane protein(s) functions in concert with cubilin to facilitate the endocytic activities. The principal candidate for such an accessory protein is megalin (also known as gp330 and LRP-2), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. Megalin binds cubilin and colocalizes with it in apical endocytic invaginations and endosomes of renal proximal tubule cells and yolk sac epithelial cells (1.Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M.

Rabbit anti-cubilin serum was provided by Dr. Pierre Verroust (Hospital Tenon, Paris, France), and IgG was purified by protein G-Sepharose chromatography. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against an amino-terminal segment of rat cubilin (residues 21–473) expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase using the pGEX6P vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting antiserum was preabsorbed on glutathioneS-transferase-Sepharose, and IgG was purified using protein G-Sepharose chromatography. Rabbit anti-megalin (rb6286) and rabbit anti-cubilin amino-terminal segment IgGs were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and tetramethylrhodamine, respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Rabbit anti-LDLR (711) was obtained from Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgGs were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Murine sarcoma virus-transformed Brown Norway rat yolk sac cells (BN cells) were provided by Dr. Pierre Verroust (Hospital Tenon, Paris, France).

Megalin (150 nm in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) was incubated with microtiter wells coated with LDL, HDL, apoHDL, apoA-I, or ovalbumin (3 μg/ml). Bound receptor was detected using the monoclonal megalin antibody 6C53C3, sheep anti-mouse IgG-horse radish peroxidase, and the chromogenic substrate o-phenylenediamine (Sigma). Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues and from BN cells using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Reverse transcription of total mRNA using random hexamer oligodeoxynucleotide primers and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (14.Barth J.L. Argraves K.M. Roark E.F. Little C.D.

For the design of mouse cubilin amplification primers, a GenBankTMsearch was used to identify an orthologous mouse cubilin cDNA (clone ID C0026H06) having 87.6% similarity to rat cubilin cDNA and encoding a polypeptide with 87.3% identity to the rat cubilin carboxyl terminus. For the design of mouse megalin primers, a 686-base pair cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession no. AF197160) was assembled from 14 overlapping mouse expressed sequence tags (GenBankTM accession numbers C80829, AI047614, AU043137,AA574617, AU043459, AA109222, AA082958, AA109769, AU045327, AU045353,AU045179, AI436683, AA617362, and AI025985). This 686-base pair cDNA is 92.6% identical to rat megalin cDNA and encodes a polypeptide 93.4% similar to the rat megalin carboxyl terminus. The PCR primer sequences used in this study are shown in TableI. Primer pairs and cDNA templates were tested over a range of amplification cycles to determine an optimal cycle number for exponential phase of production.

Open table in a new tab Cells were plated into wells of plastic chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) (4 × 104cells/cm2) and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in complete medium (minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The cells were washed once with serum-free medium (minimal essential medium, ITS (5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), penicillin/streptomycin) and incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C. Fluorescently labeled IgGs (FITC-anti-megalin and rhodamine-anti-cubilin amino-terminal segment (residues 21–473) were added (final concentration, 50 μg/ml each) in the presence or absence of HDL (final concentration, 200 μg/ml) or RAP (final concentration, 2 μm) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3% formaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Mouse embryonal teratocarcinoma F9 cells were seeded onto 0.1% gelatin-coated plates at 1 × 102 cells/cm2 and cultured for 6 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech), 10% iron-fortified bovine calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence or absence of 0.1 μmretinoic acid (Sigma) or 0.2 μm dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma). The medium was then removed, and the cells were extracted with detergent buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5 mNaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Protein concentrations in the extracts were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts (20 μg) of protein were run on Novex gels (4–12% polyacrylamide gradient) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membrane-bound proteins were detected with receptor-specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG, and ECL-plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BN cells were cultured at 1–1.5 × 105cells/cm2 in complete medium for 6 h. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium (minimal essential medium, ITS; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), penicillin/streptomycin) containing either 1) mevalonic acid lactone (50 μm) (Sigma) and sterols (25-hydroxycholesterol (1 μg/ml) and cholesterol (10 μg/ml)); 2) mevalonic acid lactone (50 μm) and compactin/mevastatin (50 μm) (Calbiochem); 3) sterols; or 4) compactin/mevastatin (50 μm). The cells were cultured for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (15.Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The medium was then removed, and the cells were extracted with detergent and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. Equal amounts (5 μg) of protein from each extract were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. BN cells were plated in 12-well plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) at 1–1.5 × 105cells/cm2 and allowed to attach for 6 h in complete medium. The cells were washed with serum-free medium; serum-free medium containing synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (5 μm) was then added and incubated with the cells for 20 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Oligodeoxynucleotides used for antisense treatment (Table II) were synthesized with phosphorothioate ester linkages (the first two and the last three linkages) and with phosphodiester linkages elsewhere. Immunoblot analysis was performed on cell extracts as described above. Cell surface receptor levels were evaluated by flow cytometry after releasing the cells from culture plates with 2 mm EDTA in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then washing the cells with serum-free medium, 0.1% sodium azide, 2% normal goat serum and incubating the cells with receptor antibodies and FITC-conjugated goat anti-IgG. For flow cytometry analysis, the cells were washed with serum-free medium and then incubated with serum-free medium containing DiI-HDL (2 μg/ml) and oligodeoxynucleotide for 1.5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were then washed, stripped of cell surface-associated DiI-HDL by treatment with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 50 μg/ml proteinase K, 0.53 mm EDTA in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to flow cytometry (FACStar Plus, Becton Dickinson).Table IIMegalin antisense oligodeoxynucleotidesOligodeoxynucleotideSequence (5′–3′)Position in cDNA sequenceaGenBank™ accession no.

Open table in a new tab Recently, we have demonstrated that cubilin can be isolated from cultured yolk sac endoderm-like cells using HDL-Sepharose affinity chromatography (4.Hammad S.M. Stefansson S. Twal W.O. Drake C.J. Fleming P. Remaley A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Argraves W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10158-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether megalin co-purifies with cubilin, immunoblot analysis was performed on cubilin-containing fractions eluted from HDL-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 1, the peak cubilin-containing fraction also contained megalin, detectable with a monoclonal antibody. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, megalin did not bind to HDL, delipidated HDL (apoHDL), or to purified apoA-I, the major apolipoprotein constituent of HDL (Fig.2). This supports the concept that the presence of megalin in the HDL-Sepharose column eluates was due to an association with cubilin rather than a direct interaction with the affinity matrix. These results are consistent with the previously reported finding that cubilin and megalin interact with high affinity (1.Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D.

As shown in Fig. 3, the overall patterns of cubilin and megalin transcript expression are overlapping. Cubilin and megalin transcripts were co-expressed in the kidney, thymus, ileum, placenta, and yolk sac. The only exception was in the lung, where megalin mRNA expression was detectable but cubilin mRNA was not. The expression of both cubilin and megalin has been shown to be stimulated in mouse F9 cells treated with a combination of retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (4.Hammad S.M. Stefansson S. Twal W.O. Drake C.J. Fleming P. Remaley A. Brewer Jr., H.B. Argraves W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10158-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13.Stefansson S. Chappell D.A. Argraves K.M. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of these agents separately on the expression of cubilin and megalin, F9 cells were cultured in the presence of each agent, and the level of receptor expression was evaluated immunologically. As shown in Fig.4, retinoic acid treatment stimulated expression of both cubilin and megalin, whereas dibutyryl cyclic AMP treatment alone had no effect on expression of either receptor (Fig.4). The fact that both cubilin and megalin are involved with lipoprotein catabolism also prompted us to determine whether the expression of either receptor was sterol-responsive, similar to the LDLR. Neither sterol-depleted conditions nor treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, compactin, increased the accumulation of cubilin or megalin mRNA or protein as was observed for the LDLR (Fig. 5). The similarity in response of the two receptors to a regulatory stimulus (Fig. 4), together with the similarity in tissue expression (Fig. 3), supports the hypothesis that they may have a functional relationship. Further support for such a relationship comes from confocal microscopic studies of the subcellular distribution of cubilin and megalin in cultured yolk sac endoderm-like cells (Fig.6). Cubilin and megalin displayed a coincident pattern of subcellular distribution consistent with an endocytic vesicle localization (Fig. 6, upper row). Treatment of the cells with RAP, an antagonist of ligand-binding to megalin, leads to a reduction in the number of punctate foci stained by cubilin antibody (Fig. 6). In contrast, RAP treatment caused a reduction in the intensity of the vesicular staining pattern of megalin but not a major reduction in the number of punctate foci per cell (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that RAP prevents cubilin from becoming efficiently internalized into endocytic vesicles while not affecting the internalization of megalin. The observed reduction in intensity of megalin staining caused by RAP could be the result of masking of epitopes or destruction of epitopes through alteration of megalin conformation. Administration of HDL abolished the vesicular staining patterns for both receptors. Since HDL does not bind to megalin (Fig. 6), these latter findings suggest that binding of HDL to cubilin sterically or allosterically prevents antibody binding to megalin, a possibility made more plausible if the two receptors existed in a complex. To determine whether megalin plays a role in endocytosis of cubilin ligands, function-blocking megalin antibodies were tested for their ability to perturb HDL uptake by cultured endoderm-like cells. Megalin antibodies were found to effectively inhibit the uptake of DiI-HDL (Fig. 7). The inhibitory effect of the megalin antibodies was apparent as a >40% reduction of the number of cells in the population that internalized DiI-HDL (Fig. 7 A) as well as a >30% reduction in the amount of DiI-HDL that the cells internalized (Fig. 7 B). Cubilin antibodies had similar effects on the uptake of DiI-HDL. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) approach was also employed to abrogate megalin expression and evaluate the consequence on cubilin-mediated HDL uptake. Cultured endoderm-like cells were treated with a series of ODNs complementary to megalin mRNA. As shown in Fig. 8, treatment of the cells with one of the antisense ODNs (A2) greatly inhibited uptake of DiI-HDL in comparison with the sense sequence of this ODN (S2) or other megalin sense and antisense ODNs (Fig. 8 A). The specificity of antisense ODN A2 treatment on megalin protein production was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of detergent extracts of the treated cells. Treatment of cells for 20 h with A2 reduced the level of megalin in cell extracts by >50% (Fig. 8 B). Analysis of the level of megalin expressed on the surface of the A2-treated cells was performed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 8 C, cells treated with the megalin antisense ODN A2 for 20 h had cell surface levels of megalin ∼50% that of cells treated with the megalin sense ODN S2. Immunoblot analysis of the conditioned culture medium from cells treated with A2 and S2 revealed no overt difference in cubilin levels (not shown). Analysis of the effects of antisense ODN A2 treatment on cubilin and LDLR protein levels in total cell extracts was also performed. As shown in Fig. 8 B, A2 treatment slightly increased (∼5%) the levels of cubilin and LDLR in total cell extracts as compared with cells treated with the sense ODN S2. Flow cytometry analysis of cubilin expression on the surface of the A2-treated cells showed ∼20% reduction in levels of cubilin as compared with the control (Fig.8 C). By contrast, there was no difference in cell surface levels of LDLR in cells treated with A2 and S2. The findings reported in this study add new dimensions to the function of megalin. First, the findings indicate that megalin can act in concert with another cell surface protein to mediate ligand endocytosis. Similar cooperative relationships have been reported for a close relative of megalin, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (16.Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). LRP cooperates with cell surface proteoglycans to mediate endocytosis of several ligands including thrombospondin-1 (17.Godyna S. Liau G. Popa I. Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,18.Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and hepatic lipase (19.Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LRP and the urokinase receptor (uPAR) cooperate in the process of endocytosis of urokinase-type plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complexes (uPA·PAI-I) (20.Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to cubilin, uPAR lacks a membrane-spanning element, but it is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the plasma membrane. Since megalin can mediate uptake of uPA·PAI-I (21.Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is plausible that megalin can also function in concert with uPAR to mediate uPA·PAI-I uptake. Such a process would, however, be distinct from megalin-mediated uptake of HDL in that uPA·PAI-I binds to megalin (21.Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but HDL and its apolipoprotein component apoA-I do not (Fig. 2). Therefore, in the process of HDL/apoA-I uptake, a transfer of HDL/apoA-I from cubilin to megalin does not seem feasible. Alternatively, megalin may mediate endocytosis of a complex of cubilin and HDL/apoA-I. An additional dimension to the functionality of megalin is highlighted by the observation that megalin antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment leads to reduced cell surface expression of cubilin. This result suggests that megalin may play a role in the biosynthetic trafficking of cubilin. Impaired cubilin trafficking to apical brush border membranes of ilieum and renal proximal tubule epithelial cells has been described in a canine model for the human autosomal recessive Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (22.Fyfe J.C.

Levine J.S. Patterson D.F. Pediatr. Res. 1991; 29: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the canine disorder, which involves defective intestinal absorption of intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex, was speculated to involve mutations within the cubilin gene as was the case for human Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (24.Aminoff M. Carter J.E. Chadwick R.B. Johnson C. Grasbeck R. Abdelaal M.A. Broch H. Jenner L.B. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. de la Chapelle A. Krahe R. Nat.

Kozyraki R. Newman T.C. Fyfe J.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 3604-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of our findings, it is possible that a mutation within the gene for megalin or its biosynthetic trafficking chaperone protein, RAP, accounts for the impaired cell surface expression of cubilin observed in the affected dogs."
https://openalex.org/W1989040424,"In recent years, a large family of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) isozymes has been characterized and cloned. Several of these PI3K enzymes have overlapping tissue distributions and it remains unclear if and how their 3-phosphoinositide products elicit differential, intracellular effects. One possibility is that the PI3K enzymes display a restricted distribution within the cell to produce their 3-phospholipid products in specific, subcellular compartments. In the present study we characterize the subcellular distribution of the novel class II PI3K isozyme PI3K-C2α in several mammalian cell types. Differential centrifugation of COS-1 and U937 cells together with Western blot analysis demonstrated that PI3K-C2α is constitutively associated with phospholipid membranes. Centrifugation of rat brain homogenates and Western blotting revealed that in contrast to the class IA PI3K enzymes, PI3K-C2α could be co-purified with a population of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Furthermore, a PI3K activity refractory to wortmannin treatment was detected in CCV preparations consistent with the presence of the PI3K-C2α isozyme. These biochemical observations were supported by immunofluorescence analysis that revealed PI3K-C2α to have a punctate distribution and an enrichment of immunoreactivity within a perinuclear site consistent with its presence in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. Dual label immunofluorescence demonstrated that in this region, the distribution of PI3K-C2α closely paralleled that of γ-adaptin, a component of the AP-1 adaptor that is present in the trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) resident protein TGN-46. Neither the phospholipid association nor the subcellular localization of PI3K-C2α was dependent upon either its COOH-terminal PX or C2 domains. Mutants lacking these domains demonstrated a similar distribution to the wild type enzyme when expressed as recombinant proteins. Treatment of cells with brefeldin A disrupted the perinuclear staining pattern of both PI3K-C2α and the AP-1 complex demonstrating that the localization of both molecules at the TGN is dependent upon ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase activity.

Since then, additional purification strategies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based approaches have identified seven other mammalian PI3K catalytic subunits. On the basis of structure and in vitro activity, these PI3K isozymes have been divided into three classes termed I, II, and III (1.Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Class I further subdivides into class IA and class IB. Class IA contains p110α, p110β, and p110δ. Each of these PI3K subunits bind a p85-like adaptor that facilitates their translocation to phosphotyrosine-containing signaling complexes. Class IB contains the G-protein-activated enzyme p110γ. This PI3K isozyme does not bind a p85 adaptor but instead a molecule termed p101 whose function is currently unclear. In vitro, these PI3K enzymes are all able to utilize phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 as substrate. However, it has been suggested that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is their principle product in situ (2.Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Class II PI3K enzymes include PI3K-C2α, PI3K-C2β, and PI3K-C2γ. They are distinguished from other PI3K isozymes by the presence of two tandem domains at their carboxyl terminus. The first is termed a phox homology (PX) domain and despite its presence in many eukaryotic signaling molecules, the function of this domain remains unclear (4.Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The second is the C2 domain which is a phospholipid-binding module that can confer a Ca2+ sensitivity (5.Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The function of either domain in the PI3K enzymes is unknown. In vitro, all class II PI3K isozymes phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P but their spectrum of 3-phosphoinositide production in vivo remains to be determined. However, PI3K-C2α plays a signaling role downstream of both the receptor for the chemokine monocyte chemotactic peptide (MCP-1) (6.Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the insulin receptor (7.Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both PI3K-C2α and PI3K-C2β are downstream signaling targets of activated epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. 2Arcaro, A., Zvelebil, M. J., Wallasch, C., Ullrich, A., Waterfield, M. D., and Domin, J. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol., in press. In platelets, PI3K-C2β is activated in response to stimulation of integrin receptors by fibronectin (9.Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although both PI3K-C2α and PI3K-C2β share a wide tissue distribution, expression of PI3K-C2γ is restricted primarily to hepatocytes (10.Ono F. Nakagawa T. Saito S. Owada Y. Sakagami H.

Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Class III PI3K contains only a single enzyme termed Vps34p. In yeast, this PI3K isozyme regulates vacuolar trafficking through its generation of PtdIns(3)P. Although a mammalian homologue of Vps34p has also been characterized, most of what we understand about its function has been extrapolated from work in yeast (12.De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 13.Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The 3-phosphoinositides produced by PI3K activity play a pivotal role as second messenger molecules in a diverse array of physiological events. These include cell proliferation, the prevention of apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, migration and motility, receptor internalization, and glucose transport (3.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In quiescent cultures, only phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) is readily detected. However, following ligand stimulation, the intracellular concentration of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 transiently increases within seconds followed by a more sustained accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2(2.Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Given that 3-phosphoinositides direct an array of molecules to different positions within the cell in response to different stimuli, some degree of spatial and temporal regulation of 3-phosphoinositide production must exist. Several PI3K isozymes may be found within any single cell type and although not all PI3K enzymes can produce each 3-phosphoinositide product there is often overlap in the distribution of PI3K isozymes within the same class. Although much effort has been applied to identifying distinct mechanisms of activation, little has been done to examine the subcellular localization of the PI3K isozymes. In eukaryotic cells, the formation and transport of vesicles from both the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes involves the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) (14.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 15.Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). While CCVs derived from the plasma membrane and TGN both contain clathrin as a major component, the two types of vesicles can be distinguished by their assembly or adaptor protein (AP). Thus, AP-1 is present on vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus while AP-2 is found on vesicles produced from the plasma membrane. Both AP-1 and AP-2 are heterotetrameric complexes. AP-1 is composed of γ and β′ adaptin (approximately 100 kDa), a 47- and 19-kDa protein. In contrast, AP-2 contains α and β adaptin (approximately 100 kDa), a 50- and 17-kDa protein (16.Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17.Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Polymerization of clathrin with AP complexes in the cell is associated with phosphoinositide interactions and an array of receptors and regulatory molecules such as the GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (18.Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs represent two sorting signals contained within the cytoplasmic portion of several receptors and transmembrane glycoproteins. Such motifs mediate interactions with either the μ2 subunit of AP-2 or the β1 subunit of AP-1 to select proteins for inclusion into the vesicle and facilitate their transfer from one part of the cell to another (19.Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,20.Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I. Cantley L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A long outstanding question remains as to how the adaptor complexes can specifically target selected intracellular membranes. Numerous studies suggest that one or more 3-phosphoinositides may provide at least part of the required specificity. However, it remains unclear which PI3K isozymes are involved in the control of vesicle trafficking. In this study we investigate the subcellular localization of PI3K-C2α with the goal of determining whether this PI3K could play a role in regulating adaptor protein function. Stock cultures of HEK293 and COS-1 cells were subcultured in 90-mm Nunc dishes using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2, 90% air at 37 °C for 3 days. After this time, cells were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The cultures were confluent and quiescent 24–48 h later. Cultures of U937 cells were passaged every 3–4 days in RPMI containing 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were disrupted by 20 strokes of a small Dounce homogenizer on ice and 10 passages through a 25-gauge needle in 1 ml of Tris/sucrose buffer (0.25 msucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 KIU/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 400 μg/ml benzamidine). Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min to yield a PM/TGN-enriched fraction and then at 350,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant pellet was referred to as the LDM fraction and the supernatant as cytosol (21.Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All centrifugations were performed at 4 °C. Crude enrichment of PM/TGN and LDM from cytosol was verified by Western blotting for M6PR, TGN-46 the human homologue of the trans-Golgi resident protein TGN-38 and measurements of lactate dehydrogenase activity. Quiescent cultures were washed twice with PBS and lysed at 4 °C with either Triton X-100 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 200 KIU/ml aprotonin, and 1 μg/ml antipain, pH 7.6) or Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and antipain, 15% glycerol, pH 7.5). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min and pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were then transferred to fresh tubes and proteins were immunoprecipitated upon addition of antibodies and protein G-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were either washed three times with lysis buffer and extracted with sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) or washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer for use in phosphoinositide kinase assays. Following extraction, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes these were blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.4. Anti-PI3K-C2α antisera (1:1000), anti-p85α (1:500), or anti-Glu (1:700) antibody was added in PBS that contained 3% milk, 0.05% Tween 20 for 2–4 h. Following a 1–2 h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled second antibody (1:5000), immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Preparations of purified CCVs, immunoprecipitated Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α or p110α were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and PtdIns at 30 °C for either 10 min (CCV preparations) or 30 min (PI3K-C2α and p110α). The formation of radiolabeled 3- and 4-phosphoinositides was determined upon separation by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography as described previously (22.Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The PX-C2 domain and C2 domain deletion mutants were prepared by a polymerase chain reaction based strategy. The sense oligonucleotide, ccttcagggttaccagaacttac, annealed across the BstEII restriction site at nucleotide 4022. The antisense oligonucleotide, ccggaattcttagatgggctcatcattagaagg, terminated the PI3K-C2α cDNA at nucleotide 4224 and incorporated a 3′ EcoRI restriction site. The antisense oligonucleotide, ccggaattcttaagacctagctatcccttcagc, terminated the PI3K-C2α cDNA at nucleotide 4638. Sense and antisense primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction using 5′ Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α-pBluescript SK plasmid as template. The 222- and 636-base pair products were purified and digested withBstEII and EcoRI enzymes together with 5′ Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α-pBluescript SK plasmid. Once re-purified, the inserts were ligated using T4 ligase. After sequencing, cDNA representing 5′ Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α, the ΔPX-C2 and ΔC2 domain deletion mutants were subcloned into pShooter (pEF/cyto, Invitrogen) using NcoI/XhoI. These constructs were used for expression of recombinant protein in mammalian cells. Cultures of HEK 293 cells (60% confluent) were transfected with 5′ Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α-pShooter, PX-C2 deleted (ΔPX-C2), and C2 domain deleted (ΔC2) 5′ Glu-tagged PI3K-C2α-pShooter plasmid (5 μg/dish) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) in accordance with the supplied protocol. Cells were used for experimental purposes, 48 h following transfection. Cells (1 × 105) were plated onto 13-mm glass coverslips and cultured overnight with 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2, 90% air. The following day, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After 6 washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and sites of nonspecific binding were blocked using PBS containing 5% non-fat dried milk, 0.05% Tween 20. All antibodies were added in PBS containing 0.5% non-fat dried milk, 0.05% Tween 20 which was also used for all washes. Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 90 min and after washing, FITC and TRITC second antibody was added at 1:400 final dilution for 60 min. After 6 washes and a final wash in H2O, the coverslips were inverted onto anti-fade mount and examined using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera (Phototronics) linked to a PC running Image ProPlus software (Media Cybernetics). Anti-PI3K-C2α antisera was produced as described previously to a NH2-terminal fragment of the PI3K-C2α protein (6.Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This was affinity purified using recombinant protein and eluted with 0.1 m glycine into Tris, pH 8. Monoclonal anti-γ adaptin AP-1 (clone 100/3) and anti-α adaptin AP-2 (clone 100/2) were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-Lamp-1 was a generous gift from Prof. C. Hopkins, Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College, London. Rabbit anti-TGN-46 was a gift from Dr. G. Banting, University of Bristol, sheep anti-TGN-46 was a gift from Dr. S. Ponnambalam, University of Dundee. Anti-M6PR antisera were a gift from Professor P. Luzio, University of Cambridge. Bovine brain CCVs were prepared using discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation steps as described previously (16.Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These partially purified preparations were further fractionated on a sucrose-D2O step gradient (23.Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the clathrin triskelion was approximated at 650 kDa. Quantification was performed by comparison of immunoblots with a 10-fold range of recombinant PI3K-C2α protein standards using methods previously described (24.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G.

Confluent and quiescent cultures of COS-1 and U937 cells were scraped into hypotonic Tris/sucrose buffer and their plasma membranes disrupted on ice using sequential Dounce homogenization and passage through a narrow gauge needle. Differential centrifugation of successive supernatants generated two membrane-enriched fractions and cytosol. Western blot analysis demonstrated that endogenous PI3K-C2α protein present in both cell types was enriched in the plasma membrane/trans-Golgi network (PM/TGN) and low density microsomal fractions (LDM) (Fig. 1). In comparison, little of this PI3K isoform was present in the cytosolic fraction (Cyt). Western blotting of the M6PR and TGN-46 confirmed the efficiency of the enrichment protocol. Each of these marker proteins predominated in the LDM and PM/TGN membrane fractions, respectively (Fig.2, upper and middle panel). Separation of membranes from cytosol was demonstrated by lactate dehydrogenase assay (Fig. 2, lower panel). Our results demonstrate that PI3K-C2α is constitutively associated with phospholipid membranes.Figure 2Characterization of the subcellular fractions. Membrane fractions were prepared from HEK293 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The PM/TGN, LDM, and cytosol fractions were extracted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted with polyclonal antisera to either the M6PR and TGN-46. Aliquots of each fraction were also examined for lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There is good evidence to demonstrate that phosphoinositides, particularly 3-phosphoinositides, bind to AP-2 adaptors (26.Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possibility that PI3K-C2α might be present in CCV, these were prepared from bovine brain using established procedures. Fractions containing equivalent protein loadings were then analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Little PI3K-C2α immunoreactivity was detected in the low speed pellet and essentially none in the high speed supernatant, however, differential sucrose and D2O gradient centrifugation of the high-speed pellet yielded fractions of progressively purified CCVs. On a per microgram basis, these were dramatically increased in PI3K-C2α content, quantitatively in parallel to the enrichment of clathrin. Interestingly, the class I PI3K adaptor p85α was also detectable in these vesicle preparations confirming an earlier report (28.Kapeller R. Chakrabarti R. Cantley L. Fay F. Corvera S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6052-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), however, only an extremely small proportion of the total cellular complement of this enzyme was present in CCVs and no evidence of any enrichment was apparent. Finally, quantification of PI3K-C2α in these CCV preparations suggests that this PI3K isozyme represents approximately 0.3% of total CCV protein. This corresponds to approximately 1 molecule of PI3K-C2α/CCV. In a complementary series of experiments, the formation of both PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4)P was detected in purified CCV fractions upon their incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and PtdIns (Fig.4, middle panel). These findings are consistent with the results presented in Fig. 3. Pretreatment of the CCV preparations with wortmannin revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of PtdIns(3)P production. However, little inhibition of enzyme activity was achieved using 10 nm wortmannin. PI3K activity was still evident using 100 nm inhibitor and only abolished using 1 μmwortmannin. This dose-effect relationship was similar to that obtained using isolated PI3K-C2α (Fig. 4, upper panel) but markedly contrasts with that using recombinant class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110α (Fig. 4, lower panel). These observations provide functional data to support the presence of the PI3K-C2α enzyme to CCV preparations. There have been few reports detailing the subcellular distribution of PI3K isozymes by immunofluorescence. The reasons for this appear to be the lack of suitable antisera combined with low levels of the endogenous protein. Alternate strategies such as the expression of epitope-tagged recombinant protein and its localization with monoclonal antibody suffers from a possible criticism. Namely, that protein distribution may become aberrant upon high levels of protein expression and possible limitation of endogenous binding partners. This is especially relevant to both the class I and III PI3K catalytic subunits. Consequently, we used an affinity purified polyclonal antibody raised against the NH2 terminus of PI3K-C2α to determine the distribution of the endogenous enzyme. Immunostaining of Triton X-100 permeabilized HEK293 cells with anti-PI3K-C2α antisera revealed a punctate distribution of immunoreactivity across the entire cell with a distinctive and characteristic enrichment in a perinuclear region (Fig.5, panels A, C, andE). Dual labeling was performed with monoclonal anti-α adaptin, anti-γ adaptin, and anti-Lamp-1 antibodies in an effort to clarify the nature of these subcellular compartments. Anti-α-adaptin also produced a punctate staining pattern (Fig. 5, panel B) similar to that observed for PI3K-C2α, however, there was little evidence of overlap in these cells. In contast, immunostaining for γ-adaptin produced a far more localized, perinuclear staining pattern (29.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, panel D). Some AP-1 adaptor containing CCVs were also scattered around the cytoplasm and close to the plasma membrane. However, it was clear that at the perinuclear region, there was marked overlap between the staining patterns of γ-adaptin and PI3K-C2α. Although there was evidence of co-localization, this overlap was not absolute. Lamp-1 is a heavily glycosylated protein present in lysosomal membranes (30.Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Our immunostaining also revealed a localized perinuclear distribution of Lamp-1 (Fig. 5, panel F) but despite a limited degree of overlap, its pattern was quite distinct from that of PI3K-C2α (Fig. 5, panel E). Even at the TGN, lysosomal membrane proteins such as Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 are packaged into vesicles that are distinct from those that carry AP-1, M6PR, and vacuolar hydroxylases (31.Karlsson K. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of epitope-tagged rat PI3K-C2γ in primate COS cells suggested that this class II PI3K isozyme also has a perinuclear distribution, however, it was also shown to be present on the plasma membrane and nuclear membranes. Unfortunately, in that study, no attempt was made to characterize the nature of the perinuclear compartment (10.Ono F. Nakagawa T. Saito S. Owada Y. Sakagami H. Goto K. Suzuki M. Matsuno S. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7731-7736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The overlap in PI3K-C2α and γ-adaptin immunostaining was further examined in COS cells (Fig. 6,upper panels). The merged image clearly shows that the distribution of the two proteins strikingly overlaps at a perinuclear region. The presence of PI3K-C2α at the TGN was confirmed by co-staining HEK-293 cells with anti-TGN-46 antisera (Fig. 6,lower panels). TGN-46 is the human homologue of TGN-38, a well characterized transmembrane protein predominantly resident in the TGN (32.Hickinson D.M. Lucocq J.M. Towler M.C. Clough S. James J. James S.R.

To examine if either the carboxyl-terminal PX domain or C2 domain that are unique to the class II PI3K enzymes were responsible for the observed membrane localization of PI3K-C2α, two deletion mutants were produced. The first termed ΔPX-C2 PI3K-C2α (encoding amino acid residues 1–1"

This reaction stimulates the release of nascent secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network of endocrine cells. To understand the role of PA in mediating secretion, we have exploited the transphosphatidylation activity of phospholipase D. Rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells, which secrete growth hormone and prolactin, were treated with 1-butanol resulting in the synthesis of phosphatidylbutanol rather than PA. Under these conditions transport from the ER through the Golgi apparatus and secretion of polypeptide hormones were inhibited quantitatively. Furthermore, the in vitro synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) by Golgi membranes was inhibited quantitatively. Most significantly, in the presence of 1-butanol the architecture of the Golgi apparatus was disrupted, resulting in its disassembly and fragmentation. Removal of the alcohol resulted in the rapid restoration of Golgi structure and secretion of growth hormone and prolactin. Our results suggest that PA stimulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis is required for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus.

A second class of molecules that regulate phosphoinositide synthesis and also function in the release of secretory vesicles are PtdIns transfer proteins (4.Roth M.G.

Whitters E.A. Henry S.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mammalian homologue of Sec14p promotes the release of nascent secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in vitro (18.Ohashi M. De Vries K.J. Frank R. Snoek G. Bankaitis V. Wirtz K. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 377: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to the above enzymes, results from several laboratories including our own, have demonstrated that phospholipase D (PLD) regulates vesicle trafficking from the Golgi apparatus (19.Ktistakis N.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar); PLD1a is a 1072-amino acid enzyme that is tightly membrane associated and localizes to the Golgi, endosomes and secretory granules (23.Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). A shorter splice variant (PLD1b) has similar properties (24.Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

PLD2 (932 residues), which is regulated by different signaling molecules from PLD1 (26.Colley W.C. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

PLD1, which is a downstream effector of the small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF-1), hydrolyzes PtdCho to phosphatidic acid (PA) and is itself regulated by PtdIns(4,5)P2 (27.Brown H.A.

Using permeabilized rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells, which secrete high levels of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL), our laboratory demonstrated that ARF-1 activates Golgi associated PLD1a and enhances release of nascent secretory vesicles from the TGN (20.Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). PLDs possess transphosphatidylation activity, and in the presence of primary alcohols a phosphatidyl alcohol is synthesized rather than PA. Several lines of evidence suggest that PA is required for vesicle trafficking. First, pretreatment of cells with PA partially protected them from alcohol-induced inhibition of vesicle transport (32.Bi K. Roth M.G. Kitistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Second, incubation of permeabilized GH3 cells with 1-BtOH inhibited nascent secretory vesicle budding from the TGN (20.Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Finally, incubation of permeabilized GH3 cells with enzymes that generate PA independently of PLD showed that the synthesis of PA resulted in efficient vesicle budding from the TGN (33.Siddhanta A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17995-17998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To understand the function of PLD activity and PA in the late secretory pathway, we treated GH3 cells with 1-BtOH. Here we demonstrate that intra-Golgi transport as well as growth hormone and prolactin secretion were inhibited by alcohol treatment. Most significantly, in the presence of 1-BtOH, the morphology of the Golgi apparatus was rapidly disrupted, resulting in its complete fragmentation. Mouse monoclonal antibody to mannosidase-II (53FC3) was a generous gift of Dr. Brian Burke (University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada), monkey anti-rat GH was a gift of Dr. Carter Bancroft (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY), and mouse monoclonal antibody to human GH was from Sigma. Rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells were grown as described previously (20.Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). VSV (Indiana serotype) was propagated in BHK cells, and GH3 cells were infected with VSV as previously (34.Green R. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were pulse-labeled with35S-Easytag 3.5–5 h after viral infection. GH3 cells were pulse-labeled with35S-Easytag for 12 min followed by chase for 2 h at 19 °C (35.Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), after which the cells were treated with or without 1-BtOH, t-BtOH, or medium alone at 37 °C and chased for varying times. At each time point the medium and cells were processed (20.Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 35.Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and incubated with antibodies to GH or PRL. For the reversal of 1-BtOH treatment, cells previously treated with 1-BtOH for 45 min were washed with fresh medium and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C; the cells and media were then assayed for secreted GH or PRL by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The fluorograms were scanned, and the band intensities were quantified with a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Approximately 107 GH3 cells were treated with or without 1-BtOH or t-BtOH, after which they were homogenized using a stainless steel ball bearing homogenizer. The homogenate was loaded onto an equilibrium floatation gradient (36.Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g av for 15 h, which separates Golgi membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum (35.Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient, and aliquots were precipitated with an equal volume of ice cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in SDS gel buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for TGN38 or the ER marker BiP by immunoblotting. VSV-infected GH3 cells were pulse-labeled with 35S-Easytag for 5 min and chased for the indicated times in the presence or absence of 1- or t-butanol. Cells were harvested directly into 1% SDS (100 μl/35-mm dish), sonicated, and boiled. Equal aliquots of each lysate were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 msodium citrate, pH 5.5, and 20 milliunits/ml of endoglycosidase H (endo H; Oxford Glycosystems, UK) were added to one sample, whereas the control received an equal volume of buffer. Incubation was at 37 °C for 16 h, after which samples were analyzed in a 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. The assay was performed according to Wakelam et al. (37.Wakelam M.J.O Hodgkin M. Martin A. Kendall D.A. Hill S.J. Signal Transduction Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 271-278Google Scholar) with modifications as described (20.Chen Y.G.

Golgi membranes isolated from GH3 cells were incubated without or with rat brain cytosol (final concentration, 2.2 mg protein/ml) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 125 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP at a final specific activity of 70 μCi/μmol. Where present, an Sf-9 cell lysate expressing recombinant human PLD1a was used at a final concentration of 32 μg/ml (20.Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Samples (110 μl) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 176 μl of 1 n HCl followed by 352 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The chloroform phase was separated by centrifugation, transferred to a fresh tube, and washed with 500 μl of methanol:1n HCl (1:1). The organic phase was vacuum dried and resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform:methanol:12 n HCl (200:100:1) and spotted onto TLC plates impregnated with oxalic acid. The plates were developed with CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11:1.6), and the radiolabeled phospholipids were identified by autoradiography and their co-migration with nonradioactive standards. To definitively identify the phosphoinositide species, the radioactive spots were excised from the TLC plates, deacylated, and analyzed by ion exchange HPLC using a Whatman Partisphere SAX column exactly as described by Tolias et al. (72.Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibasaki J.C. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Phospholipids (obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) were dissolved in chloroform (10 mg/ml) and stored at −20 °C as per the manufacturer's instructions. For the reversal experiment (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 32.Bi K. Roth M.G. Kitistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), cells were incubated with35S-Easytag for 10 min at 37 °C and chased at 19 °C for 2 h followed by an additional 30-min incubation in serum-free medium containing 1,2-dilauroyl PA, -PtdCho, or -DAG at 19 °C. At the end of 30 min, the phospholipid containing medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium containing half the original lipid concentration with or without 1-BtOH as indicated. The samples were then incubated for an additional 45 min at 37 °C, following which the cell lysates and media were analyzed for the presence of immunoreactive GH or PRL. Cells were grown on poly-lysine coated coverslips, treated with or without 1-BtOH or t-BtOH at 37 °C and prepared as described (35.Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Samples were then incubated in the presence of rabbit anti-TGN38 serum (1:100 dilution) and a monoclonal antibody against α-mannosidase-II (53FC3), a cis-medial Golgi marker (38.Burke B. Warren G. Cell. 1984; 36: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or a monoclonal antibody to human GH followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:300 dilution), and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100 dilution). Slides were examined using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 Kr/Ar laser scanning confocal microscope on a Nikon Eclipse 200 microscope with a 60× N.A. 1.4 planapo infinity corrected objective. Z series images were collected through the depth of the cells using a zoom of 2× and a step size of 0.8 μm; they were projected using the maximum pixel method. Controls were imaged to ensure no background fluorescence or cross-talk between the FITC and Cy3 channels. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software at identical settings. Samples were treated with or without 1-BtOH or t-BtOH, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mcacodylate buffer, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 1% uranyl acetate. The samples were then dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol concentrations and embedded in LX112 resin (LADD Research Industries, Burlington, VT). Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E, stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. To quantitate the extent of Golgi apparatus fragmentation, electron micrographs (at a final magnification of 40,500×) taken from control GH3 cells and cells treated with 1-BtOH or t-BtOH or following 1-BtOH removal were analyzed for the presence of Golgi cisternae. A Golgi stack was defined as consisting of at least two cisternae; cisternae were membrane images with a length greater than four times the width, in which the width was not greater than 80 nm (39.Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 16–34 randomly selected micrographs of samples from each treatment were analyzed by determining the number of Golgi structures that intersected the lines of a 7.5 × 7.5-cm grid placed on different areas of each micrograph. The number of structures corresponding to Golgi cisternae and stacks were counted; very rarely dilated Golgi cisternae greater than 80 nm in width were detected in response to alcohol treatment. To determine whether PA synthesis was required for sorting of polypeptide hormones into post-Golgi vesicles and secretionin vivo, we exploited the transphosphatidylation activity of PLD. GH3 cells were pulse labeled with 35S-Easytag, followed by 2 h of incubation at 19 °C to accumulate radiolabeled cargo molecules (GH and PRL) in the TGN (36.Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were then shifted to 37 °C for 45 min in the absence or presence of 1-BtOH, t-BtOH, or buffer alone, and hormone secretion was determined (Fig. 1). GH3 cells store their endogenous GH and PRL poorly, and in control cells approximately 80% of the pulse labeled hormones are rapidly secreted into the medium (Fig. 1, A, lanes 3 and 4, andB). However, in the presence of 1-BtOH, all the pulse labeled GH and PRL was retained within the cells, and no radiolabeled hormones were secreted (Fig. 1, A, lanes 5 and6, and B). In contrast, when t-BtOH was present during incubation at 37 °C, GH and PRL were secreted with the same efficiency and kinetics as control untreated GH3 cells (Fig. 1,A, lanes 7 and 8, and B). The inhibition of secretion induced by 1-BtOH could be reversed by wash-out of the BtOH-containing medium; under these conditions, GH and PRL were then secreted efficiently (Fig. 1, A, lanes 9–11, and B). If PA accumulation were required for secretory vesicle budding, then preloading cells with PA should abrogate the 1-BtOH-mediated inhibition of secretion. To test this idea, GH3 cells were pulse labeled and chased at 19 °C followed by incubation with 1,2-dilauroyl-PA for an additional 30 min at 19 °C to facilitate lipid endocytosis. Following this step, the cells were treated with and without 1-BtOH at 37 °C, and GH secretion was determined (Fig. 1, C andD). To ensure PA uptake from the medium, cells were incubated in the absence of serum, and consequently basal GH secretion was diminished considerably (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and2). Strikingly, addition of PA itself stimulated GH secretion approximately 2–5-fold (Fig. 1, C, lanes 5–10, and D), whereas 1,2-dilauroyl-PtdCho or -DAG were without effect (not shown). Most significantly, addition of 250 μm PA enhanced hormone secretion about 3-fold even in the presence of 1-BtOH (Fig. 1, C, lanes 13 and14, and D); in contrast, DAG had no effect (Fig.1 C, lanes 15 and 16). It might be argued that PA behaved as a detergent to render the membranes leaky. However, this was not the case because pretreating the cells with PA at 4 °C (which allows uptake of PA; Ref. 40.Pagano R.E. Longmuir K.J. Martin O.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not enhance secretion or reverse the BtOH effect, and no abundant cytosolic proteins (e.g. ARFs) were detected in the medium following incubation at 37 °C (data not shown). To determine whether 1-BtOH treatment affected earlier steps in the secretory pathway, GH3 cells were infected with VSV, and the transit of the viral membrane G-glycoprotein to the late Golgi apparatus was determined by measuring its acquisition of resistance to endo H (Fig.2). Early work from our laboratory (34.Green R. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) demonstrated that VSV-G protein rapidly exits the ER in these cells and becomes largely endo H-resistant (>60%) by 10 min of chase. GH3 cells were infected with VSV, radiolabeled for 5 min with35S-Easytag, and chased in the presence of t- or 1-BtOH (Fig. 2). In agreement with our previous results, by 10 min of chase approximately 60% of pulse labeled G protein was endo H-resistant in control or t-BtOH-treated cells and was completely resistant by 20–40 min of chase (Fig. 2, lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). In contrast, in cells treated with 1-BtOH, the G protein was endo H-sensitive at all time points and remained endo H-sensitive up to 60 min of chase, the longest time examined (lanes 13–22). Upon wash-out of the 1-BtOH, the G protein became endo H-resistant by 20–30 min following removal of the alcohol (lanes 23–26). We argued that the inhibition of VSV-G transport and hormone secretion by 1-BtOH resulted from PLD-mediated PtdBtOH synthesis. To test this idea, cells were incubated with [3H]oleate to radiolabel phospholipids and treated with 1-BtOH, and the phospholipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Consistent with our hypothesis, PtdBtOH accumulated only in cells treated with 1-BtOH (data not shown). These results and our previous observation that PA promotes vesicle budding from the TGN (33.Siddhanta A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17995-17998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) provides further evidence that PLD activity is a prerequisite for secretory vesicle release from the TGN. The restoration of intra-Golgi transport and secretion following 1-BtOH removal may have resulted from the rapid metabolism of PtdBtOH, a nonphysiological lipid that might be toxic to cells. Alternatively, the absence of PA synthesis as a consequence of PtdBtOH formation may have lead to the inhibition of secretion. To distinguish between these possibilities, cells were radiolabeled with [3H]oleic acid and treated with 1-BtOH followed by removal of the alcohol. At various times (up to 2 h) after 1-BtOH wash-out, total phospholipids were extracted, analyzed by TLC, and the level of PtdBtOH was determined (Fig. 3). Approximately 50% of the initial amount of PtdBtOH was still present in the cells at 120 min after alcohol removal. Significantly, the restoration of intra-Golgi transport of VSV-G protein and hormone secretion occurred by 30 min after 1-BtOH wash-out (Fig. 2 and data not shown),i.e. when PtdBtOH was present at approximately 75% of its initial level. This result demonstrated that the accumulation of PtdBtOH per se was not toxic to GH3 cells; in agreement with the data of Fig. 1 C, these results suggested that the absence of PA synthesis lead to inhibition of secretion. Because of its low abundance and rapid turnover in cells (37.Wakelam M.J.O Hodgkin M. Martin A. Kendall D.A. Hill S.J. Signal Transduction Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 271-278Google Scholar), we were unable to measure changes in PA levels directly in response to alcohol removal. Phosphatidic acid exists transiently in cells and does not accumulate to significant steady state levels. We hypothesized that PA might be rapidly metabolized to another phospholipid in the Golgi apparatus or might affect the synthesis of other phospholipids. In this context, PA has previously been shown to stimulate Type I but not Type II phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) 5-kinase isoforms, the final enzymes involved in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) biosynthesis (41.Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently Arneson et al. (42.Arneson L.S. Kunz J. Anderson R.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17794-17805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PtdIns(4,5)P2 biosynthesis can occur on lysosomal membranes, and this was enhanced by PA. In addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is an essential co-factor for PLD activity (29.Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

To determine whether PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis occurred on Golgi membranes and if it were responsive to PA or PtdBtOH, isolated Golgi membranes were incubated with [32P]ATP in the absence and presence of cytosol with and without 1-BtOH (Fig.4).

These results suggest that recruitment of p300/CBP to the Tax/CREB/21-bp repeat complex is necessary, but not sufficient, for Tax-dependent trans-activation. Thus, interactions between Tax and additional cellular co-activators or general transcription factors are likely to be essential. p300/CBP are general integrators of signal-dependent transcription; a diverse array of enhancer-binding factors utilize these co-activators for transcriptional activation in response to extracellular stimuli (49.Giles R.H.

Here, we provide evidence that recruitment of both p300/CBP and P/CAF by HTLV-1 Tax to the activator-21-bp repeat enhancer complex is essential for efficient LTR-dependent trans-activation. Moreover, we show that Tax-mediated LTR trans-activation is competitively inhibited by co-expressing the E1A 12S gene product, which inactivates both P/CAF and p300/CBP (57.Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V.

Tax-derived mutants, defective for direct interactions with either of these co-activators, in vitroand in vivo, are similarly defective in their abilities to activate transcription. These observations further imply that Tax might influence nuclear P/CAF-containing complexes; thereby potentially contributing to the pleiotropic dysregulated expression of numerous cellular genes during leukemogenesis. HeLa cells (ATCC) were plated at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.). These cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and transfected using liposome-mediated DNA transfer (LipofectAMINE reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were incubated for 4 h with the DNA/liposome mixtures; immediately following the incubation period, the transfection solution was removed, cells were washed with serum-free medium, and 2.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin, was added to each dish. The transfected cells were incubated for another 48 h and harvested for CAT-reporter assays by scraping, or extracted for immunoprecipitation. To control for variation in transfection efficiencies, cells were transfected in parallel with a CMV-lac Z expression vector and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside for β-galactosidase expression. CAT-reporter assays were carried out as previously reported (40.Harrod R. Tang Y. Nicot C. Lu H.S. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Results were quantified from triplicate experiments using an EAGLE-EYE II Video-imaging system (Stratagene, Inc.). Co-immunoprecipitations were carried out using extracts prepared from HeLa cells, transfected as described with a CMV-driven, FLAG epitope-tagged (f)P/CAF expression vector and either a CMV-driven wild-type or mutant, Tax expression plasmid. Transfected cells were harvested by scraping, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS), containing 50 ng/ml each of the protease inhibitors, pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, bestatin, antipain-dihydrochloride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), by repeated passage through a 27.5-gauge syringe. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Two-hundred and fifty microliters from each sample was used for immunoprecipitation. Lysates were precleared by incubation with either 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A- (Pierce, Inc.) or Protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μl of antiserum for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by brief centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min. After preclearing, either 100 μl of an anti-Tax, monoclonal antibody (4C5) against a C-terminal epitope (located after residue 324) in Tax, 2Y. Yao, Y-L. Kuo, Y. Tang, R. Harrod, C. Broder, W. Harrington, and C-Z. Giam, manuscript in preparation. or 10 μl of anti-FLAG-M2, mouse monoclonal antibody (Eastman-Kodak Corp.), were added to each sample. The reactions were preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h; then, 100 μl of either protein A-agarose, or Protein G-agarose, were added to reactions containing anti-Tax or anti-FLAG-M2 antibodies, respectively, and further incubated overnight. On the following day, immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, washed three times with 500 μl of RIPA buffer containing the above mentioned protease inhibitors, and resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min, centrifuged, and 15 μl from each were loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing a 4% stacking gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V/150 mAmps using a 0.25m Tris, 0.19 m glycine, 0.1% SDS running buffer; gels were transferred through a 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 10% (v/v) methanol buffer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Inc.), and used for immunoblotting by standard protocols. For detection of (f)P/CAF expression, blots were incubated for 2 h with anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (diluted 1:1000), washed twice with BLOTTO buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 5% nonfat dry milk), incubated for 1 h in an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), washed twice with BLOTTO, and once again with phosphate-buffered saline, and developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal, Pierce, Inc.). For detection of HTLV-1 Tax, or Tax-derived mutant proteins, the nitrocellulose membranes were probed with the anti-Tax monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:20) and immunoblotted as described. X-ray film was briefly exposed for autoradiography as previously mentioned. Alternatively, co-immunoprecipitations were performed using extracts prepared either from Jurkat and HTLV-1 transformed cell-lines (MT-4 and C8166), or JPX-9 cells, which express a metal-inducible version of wild-type Tax, induced for 12 h with 0, 1.5, 15, or 30 μm CdCl2 in RPMI medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 10% CO2. Extracts were prepared and treated as described previously, with the exception that immunoprecipitations were performed using 5 μl of a goat polyclonal, anti-P/CAF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and Tax was detected in P/CAF-containing complexes by Western blotting. The RcCMV plasmid, CMV-(f)P/CAF, CMV-E1A 12S, CMV-E1A 12SΔN, CMV-HTLV-1 Tax expression vectors, the CMV-driven expression vectors for the Tax-derived mutants, M47, K88A, and V89A, 218-CAT reporter plasmid, GST-HTLV-1 Tax, and GST-M47 vectors have all been previously described (22.Zhao L.J.

Purification protocols for baculovirus-expressed p300 and FLAG epitope-tagged (f)P/CAF have likewise been reported elsewhere (54.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

To examine the possibility that HTLV-1 Tax and P/CAF might directly interact, 0.5–1 μg of purified GST or GST-Tax fusion protein (or an equivalent amount of each GST-Tax mutant protein) was pre-immobilized on 60 μl of a 50% slurry of washed glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 200 μl of 1 × binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 2 h. The bound matrices were washed twice with 500 μl of 1 × binding buffer, pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in 30 μl of 1 × binding buffer. Purified, FLAG epitope-tagged (f)PCAF (0.2–0.5 μg) was added to each binding reaction and samples were incubated for 30 min, with agitation, at room temperature. Following incubation, the bound matrices were washed three times with 500 μl of 1 × binding buffer and pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated to 95 °C, and 15 μl from each reaction were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described. To examine the recruitment of P/CAF and p300 by HTLV-1 Tax into a multiprotein complex bound to the 21-bp repeat DNA, we labeled 1 μg of the annealed oligonucleotides: 5′-GATCTGGGCGTTGACGACAACCCCTCACCTCAAAAAACTTTC-3′ and 5′-TTTGAAAGTTTTTTGAGGTGAGGGGTTGTCGTCAACGCCCAGATC-3′ (HTLV-1 21-bp repeat sequence is shown in bold), with biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 7.5 units of Klenow (New England Biolabs, Inc.) at 37 °C for 30 min. Labeled oligonucleotides were electrophoresed and purified from a 7.5% TBE (Tris borate/EDTA) acrylamide gel, eluted in 250 μl of deionized dH2O, quantified, and 10 μl (20 ng) were used in each binding reaction. Sixty microliters of a 50% slurry of washed, streptavidin-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) were mixed with 20 ng of biotinylated oligonucleotide in 200 μl of 1 × binding buffer (see above) and preincubated on ice for 2 h. The bound matrices were washed twice with 500 μl of 1 × binding buffer, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in a total reaction volume of 50 μl (1 × binding buffer). One microgram of purified CREB bZip, 200 ng of HTLV-1 Tax-His6 (or Tax-derived mutant), 500 ng of baculovirus-expressed p300, and 500 ng of (f)P/CAF was added to each binding reaction and incubated at room temperature, with agitation for 30 min. Following incubation, the matrices were washed three times (5 min each) with 500 μl of 1 × binding buffer, pelleted, and resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Ten microliters from each sample were heated at 95 °C for 3 min and loaded either on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, or a pre-cast 4–20% Tris glycine acrylamide gel (Novex, Inc.), for resolution of bound products. After electrophoresis, the gels were either transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting (Tax, P/CAF, p300) as described, or stained with Coomassie Blue reagent for direct visualization (CREB bZip). Purified p300 was detected using a monoclonal anti-p300 antibody (diluted 1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); P/CAF was detected using a goat anti-P/CAF polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).

Previous studies showed that iNOS is induced in the brain by systemic treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Gram-negative bacteria-derived stimulant of the innate immune system. Here we found that eNOS mRNA is induced in the rat brain by intraperitoneal injection of LPS of a smaller amount than that required for induction of iNOS mRNA. The induction of eNOS mRNA was followed by an increase in eNOS protein. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that eNOS is located in astrocytes of both gray and white matters as well as in blood vessels. Induction of eNOS in response to a low dose of LPS, together with its localization in major components of the blood-brain barrier, suggests that brain eNOS is involved in early pathophysiologic response against systemic infection before iNOS is induced with progression of the infection.

In order to clarify roles of NOS isoforms in the nervous system, we previously examined precise distribution of nNOS mRNA in the rat brain, by using high resolution non-radioisotopic in situhybridization (5.Iwase K.

We have also studied regulation of the iNOS gene in response to LPS in peripheral organs, being concerned with coordination with genes for l-arginine-metabolizing enzymes (29.Nagasaki A. Gotoh T.

In the course of examining the effects of LPS on expression of the three NOS isoforms, we by chance found that a relatively low dose of LPS induces mRNA for eNOS, but not for iNOS, in the rat brain. Specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats (5–6 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally withEscherichia coli LPS (serotype 0127:B8, Sigma), and after appropriate times brain and other organs were excised from the rats anesthetized in ether. Regional dissection of the rat brain was done essentially according to the division of Glowinski and Iversen (31.Glowinski J. Iversen L.L. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (5041) Google Scholar). Total RNA from rat tissues was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, RNA was transferred to nylon membranes. The digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe was synthesized using the DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) with cDNA templates for rat eNOS (corresponding to nucleotides 44–1164 of the human sequence of Ref. 33.Janssens S.P.

Hansson G.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and rat nNOS (nucleotides 296–2150 of Ref. 35.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). eNOS and iNOS cDNAs were amplified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNAII and the HincII site of pGEM3Zf(+), respectively. nNOS cDNA was isolated as described previously (5.Iwase K. Iyama K. Akagi K. Yano S. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Mori M. Takiguchi M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 53: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After hybridization and washing as recommended by Roche Molecular Biochemicals, chemiluminescent detection of hybridized probes on x-ray films was done using the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated DIG antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and CDP-Star™ (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Densitometric quantification was performed using the MacBas bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Rat tissues were homogenized in nine volumes of 20 mm potassium HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm antipain, 50 μm leupeptin, 50 μm chymostatin, and 50 μm pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was used as tissue extract. Protein in the tissue extract was determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The tissue extracts (15 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein was electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. As a primary antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-human eNOS antibody (1:50 dilution; N30030; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in Fig. 3 or a monoclonal anti-human eNOS antibody (1 μg/ml IgG; N30020; Transduction Laboratories) in Fig. 4 was incubated with the membranes. Immunodetection was performed using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Chemiluminescent signals were detected on x-ray films and quantified using the MacBas bioimage analyzer.Figure 4Distribution of NOS isoforms in the rat brain regions. A, Northern blot analysis for detection of mRNAs for nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS was performed with total RNAs from various brain regions: Ob, olfactory bulb; Cx, cerebral cortex; St, striatum; Hp, hippocampus;Hy, hypothalamus; MT, midbrain and thalamus;Cb, cerebellum; PM, pons and medulla oblongata. As positive controls (P.C.) for iNOS and eNOS mRNAs, total RNAs prepared from the LPS-treated rat lung and the normal rat heart, respectively, were coelectrophoresed. Below, ethidium bromide staining of 28 and 18 S rRNAs is presented. B, Western blot analysis. Distribution of eNOS protein was examined for tissue extracts from the brain regions. As a positive control (P.C.), a human endothelial cell lysate was coelectrophoresed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The tissue extracts were prepared as described above. NOS catalytic activity was assayed by determining the conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline essentially as described (36.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar, 37.Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent NOS activity was measured by incubating 50 μg of extract protein in a mixture (200 μl) containing 50 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 mm NADPH, 10 μm FAD, 10 μm FMN, 0.5 μm calmodulin, and 0.1 μml-[3H]arginine (49.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C for 30 min. In the Ca2+-independent NOS assay, EGTA (1 mm) was substituted for CaCl2. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 3% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min on ice, 250 μl of 1.5 m potassium HEPES (pH 7.5) were added, and the precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 15,800 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were applied to 1-ml columns of Dowex 50W-X8 (Na+ form), and elutedl-[3H]citrulline was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activity was expressed as picomoles ofl-[3H]citrulline produced/mg of protein in 1 min. Data are represented as mean ± range. Excised rat brains were embedded in OCT Compound™ (Miles, Elkhart, IN) and frozen in the liquid nitrogen. Ten-μm sections were cut, air-dried, washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with methanol for 10 min on ice. After inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity by the method of Isobe et al. (38.Isobe Y. Chen S.-T. Nakane P.K. Brown W.R. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 10: 161-171Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the sections were subjected to incubation with the primary antibody diluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) overnight at 4 °C. A primary antibody used was a rabbit polyclonal anti-human eNOS antibody (1:200–5000 dilution) or a mouse monoclonal anti-human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (28 μg/ml IgG; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). After incubation with the biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 2 h, the sections were further incubated with a mixture of avidin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated biotin for 1 h. Peroxidase activity was visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a substrate. Double-staining analysis with the rabbit polyclonal anti-eNOS antibody and the mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody was performed by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase and alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase procedure using the Doublestain kit (Dako Corp.). For control, sections were incubated with rabbit serum or non-immunized mouse IgG1 instead of each specific primary antibody. Sections were slightly counterstained with hematoxylin, and the slides were mounted in Aquatex (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Rats were injected intraperitoneally withEscherichia coli LPS at 2.5 μg/g body weight, and 12 h later eNOS mRNA levels in various organs were examined by RNA blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). In the heart and kidney, eNOS mRNA levels were lowered by the LPS treatment, concordant with a previous report (17.Liu S.F. Adcock I.M. Old R.W. Barnes P.J. Evans T.W. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 24: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the brain, eNOS mRNA was increased in response to LPS. No apparent induction of iNOS mRNA was observed in the brain with this amount of LPS, while the induction was obvious in the lung (Fig.1 B). The LPS treatment had no effect on nNOS mRNA levels in the brain (Fig. 1 C). Previously, it has been reported that mRNA for iNOS, rather than eNOS, is induced in the brain as well as in other organs by LPS treatment (16.Hom G.J. Grant S.K. Wolfe G. Bach T.J. MacIntyre D.E. Hutchinson N.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 452-459PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Liu S.F. Adcock I.M. Old R.W. Barnes P.J. Evans T.W. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 24: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Wong M.-L. Rettori V. Al-Shekhlee A. Bongiorno P.B. Canteros G. McCann S.M. Gold P.W. Licinio J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Since the discrepancy can result from differences of experimental conditions, we examined changes in eNOS and iNOS mRNA levels with various amounts of LPS (Fig.2). eNOS mRNA was substantially induced with LPS at 2.5 μg/g, and reached a plateau level at 10 μg/g. On the other hand, only a slight increase in iNOS mRNA was detected at 10 μg/g, and a maximum increase at 50 μg/g. In previous studies (16.Hom G.J. Grant S.K. Wolfe G. Bach T.J. MacIntyre D.E. Hutchinson N.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 452-459PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Liu S.F. Adcock I.M. Old R.W. Barnes P.J. Evans T.W. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 24: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Wong M.-L. Rettori V. Al-Shekhlee A. Bongiorno P.B. Canteros G. McCann S.M. Gold P.W. Licinio J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), induction of iNOS mRNA in the brain has been detected with comparable amounts of LPS (15–50 μg/g). mRNA levels for both eNOS and iNOS decreased with LPS at 100 μg/g, compared with at 50 μg/g. The exact reason for these decreases is not known, but a possible cause is the nonspecific catastrophic damage of the brain, since the LPS treatment at this concentration occasionally resulted in death of the animals. In conclusion, in the pathophysiologic dose range, higher amounts of LPS are required for induction of iNOS mRNA than in that for eNOS mRNA. Time course of changes in mRNA and protein levels for eNOS in the brain after treatment with LPS (2.5 μg/g) are shown in Fig.3. eNOS mRNA levels were raised 6 h after the treatment, and reached a maximum at 12 h. A delayed increase in eNOS protein levels was apparent at 12 h, and an additional increase at 24 h. Therefore, induction of eNOS mRNA in response to LPS leads to accumulation of eNOS protein. We also examined changes in NOS catalytic activity in the brain 24 h after treatment with LPS (2.5 μg/g). Total Ca2+-dependent NOS activity, which is derived mainly from nNOS and eNOS isoforms, slightly increased to 5.28 ± 0.22 pmol/mg/min compared with 4.50 ± 0.25 pmol/mg/min for the control (mean ± range, n = 2). On the other hand, iNOS-derived Ca2+-independent activity was below the detectable level in both control and LPS-treated rats. We further tried to measure eNOS activity specifically, by using nNOS inhibitors such asN ω-propyl-l-arginine (39.Zhang H.Q. Fast W. Marletta M.A. Martasek P. Silverman R.B. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3869-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and 1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)imidazole (40.Handy R.L.C. Wallace P. Gaffen Z.A. Whitehead K.J. Moore P.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2349-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and by using antibodies against eNOS and nNOS (for each isoform, two commercially available antibodies) for immunoselection of eNOS and immunodepletion of nNOS, respectively. However, these attempts were unsuccessful, presumably at least in part because of relatively high nNOS activity that amounts to more than 90% of total NOS activity in the normal rodent brain (41.Huang P.L. Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1273-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Distribution of NOS isoforms in various regions of the rat brain was examined by RNA blot analysis (Fig. 4 A). nNOS mRNA was detected in all brain regions examined, exhibiting higher levels in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum than in other regions, concordant with previous reports (5.Iwase K. Iyama K. Akagi K. Yano S. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Mori M. Takiguchi M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 53: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). iNOS mRNA was under the detectable level in any region of the normal rat brain. eNOS mRNA was detected in all brain regions, and showed more equal distribution than nNOS mRNA. By using immunoblot analysis (Fig.4 B), the eNOS protein of about 135 kDa was also detected in all brain regions, and showed rather uniform distribution resembling that of eNOS mRNA. To determine the precise localization of the eNOS protein, immunohistochemical staining was performed on brain sections (Fig.5, A–H). As expected, blood vessels showed strong eNOS immunoreactivity in almost all brain regions examined (Fig. 5, A and D). No apparent signal was detected with a control non-immune antibody (data not shown). Strong staining was also detected in cells morphologically resembling astrocytes in the white matter of the striatum (Fig. 5 A), anterior commissure (Fig. 5 B), corpus callosum, fimbria of the hippocampus, internal capsule (Fig. 5 C), and cerebellum (Fig. 5 H). Less intense but obvious staining was detected in astrocyte-like cells in the gray matter of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 5,D and E), hippocampus (Fig. 5, F andG), and cerebellum (Fig. 5 H). Some astrocyte-like cells were seen to radiate the processes coming in contact with blood vessels (Fig. 5 A; see also Fig. 5 M). In the hippocampus, immunolabeling was located in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum (Fig. 5 G). On the other hand, in contrast to the previous reports (19.Dinerman J.L. Dawson T.M. Schell M.J. Snowman A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4214-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 24.O'Dell T.J. Huang P.L. Dawson T.M. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Kandel E.R. Fishman M.C. Science. 1994; 265: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), no obvious signal was detected in pyramidal neurons under the present condition. In the cerebellum (Fig.5 H), the deep white matter showed strong staining. Moderate and weak signals were detected in the granular layer and molecular layer, respectively, while no apparent signal in the Purkinje cell layer. Expression of eNOS protein in astrocytes was confirmed by examining colocalization with GFAP as a marker for astrocytes (Fig. 5,I–K). Immunostaining of serial sections with the anti-eNOS antibody (Fig. 5 I) or anti-GFAP antibody (Fig.5 J) exhibited a similar pattern of distribution of positive cells. Furthermore, double staining for eNOS and GFAP (Fig.5 K) detected overlapping immunoreactive cells, verifying colocalization of these two proteins. The effect of LPS treatment on eNOS immunostaining was examined (Fig.5, L and M). Concordant with the results of protein blotting analysis (Fig. 3), the strength of immunolabeling increased by the LPS treatment for 24 h, while precise quantitative analysis on increase in the number of positive astrocytes and/or in the intensity of labeling in each cell remains to be performed. This study showed that intraperitoneal injection of LPS causes an increase in eNOS expression specifically in the brain, making a sharp contrast to decreases in the heart and kidney (Fig. 1 A). This can be at least in part because of the difference of cells expressing eNOS in the brain and other organs. As reported previously (20.Doyle C.A. Slater P. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21.Barna M. Komatsu T. Reiss C.S. Virology. 1996; 223: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22.Gabbott P.L.A. Bacon S.J. Brain Res. 1996; 714: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and confirmed here (Fig. 5), astrocytes as well as endothelial cells are a major source of eNOS in the brain. It remains to be examined if the increase in eNOS expression in astrocytes is directly triggered by LPS itself or mediated by LPS-induced agents such as cytokines. The latter possibility is especially noteworthy, taking the blood-brain barrier into account. Astrocytes themselves constitute the outer component of the blood-brain barrier, and are separated from blood flow by tightly connected endothelial cells and the basement membrane. Therefore, it should be carefully examined if LPS of low concentrations in blood flow can directly reach astrocytes. Possible involvement of the blood-brain barrier in the LPS response of the brain was also suggested by the fact that higher amounts of LPS were necessary for iNOS induction in the brain than in the lung (Figs.1 B and 2). What are the roles of astroglial eNOS? Barna et al. (21.Barna M. Komatsu T. Reiss C.S. Virology. 1996; 223: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that infection of the mouse brain by vesicular stomatitis virus led to increases in eNOS protein in astrocytes, implying a role of astroglial eNOS in inhibition of local brain infection. On the other hand, the present demonstration that astroglial eNOS was induced in response to intraperitoneal injection of LPS suggests involvement of astroglial eNOS in protection of the brain against systemic bacterial infection. Localization of eNOS in endothelial cells and astrocytes, namely two major components of the blood-brain barrier that is the defensive front of the brain, is also concordant with this notion. The amount of LPS required for induction of eNOS was smaller than that required for induction of iNOS, suggesting that eNOS can be induced in relatively early stages following bacterial infection. In summary, astroglial eNOS is likely to be involved in early precaution and defense against systemic infection. Studies with eNOS knockout mice revealed that eNOS is involved in protection of neurons on brain ischemia (28.Huang Z. Huang P.L. Ma J. Meng W. Ayata C. Fishman M.C. Moskowitz M.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), in addition to regulation of systemic blood pressure (42.Huang P.L. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 43.Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.-S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether eNOS with this protective effect is attributable to astrocytes or endothelial cells. Gene knockout and related studies have also revealed that eNOS is involved in neuronal functions such as long term potentiation in the hippocampus (24.O'Dell T.J. Huang P.L. Dawson T.M. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Kandel E.R. Fishman M.C. Science. 1994; 265: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25.Son H. Hawkins R.D. Martin K. Kiebler M. Huang P.L. Fishman M.C. Kandel E.R.

Shimizu-Sasamata M. Huang P.L. Moskowitz M.A. Lo E.H. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These functions of eNOS have been attributed to the enzyme located in neurons, on the assumption that brain eNOS is mainly distributed in neurons (19.Dinerman J.L. Dawson T.M. Schell M.J. Snowman A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4214-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, since the present and other studies (21.Barna M. Komatsu T. Reiss C.S. Virology. 1996; 223: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22.Gabbott P.L.A. Bacon S.J. Brain Res. 1996; 714: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated preferential distribution of eNOS in astrocytes rather than in neurons, it is tempting to speculate that NO derived from astroglial eNOS modulates these neuronal functions. Possible involvement of eNOS in neuronal functions suggests that a part of anti-microbial effects of astroglial eNOS can be mediated also through neuronal activities such as driving the autonomic nervous system that controls both brain and peripheral organs. Conditional astrocyte-specific disruption of the eNOS gene will provide useful tools to evaluate these intriguing roles of astroglial eNOS. We thank S. Fujimura for encouragement and S. Goto, K. Iyama, K. Sugahara, M. Takeya, T. Hiwasa, and colleagues for suggestions and discussions."

Modulation of glucose transport could be important for the cardioprotective effects of brief intermittent periods of ischemia and reperfusion, termed ischemic preconditioning. Previous work indicates that preconditioning reduces production of acid and lactate during subsequent sustained ischemia, consistent with decreased glucose utilization. However, there are also data that preconditioning enhances glucose uptake. The present study examines whether preconditioning alters glucose transport and whether this is mediated by either phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or p38 MAP kinase. Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were preconditioned with 4 cycles of 5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion, with glucose as substrate. During the last reflow, glucose was replaced with 5 mm acetate and 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), and hexose transport was measured from the rate of production of 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate (2DG6P), using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. Preconditioning stimulated 2DG uptake; after 15 min of perfusion with 2DG, 2DG6P levels were 165% of initial ATP in preconditioned hearts compared with 96% in control hearts (p < 0.05). Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, did not block the preconditioning induced stimulation of 2DG6P production, but perfusion with SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, did attenuate 2DG6P accumulation (111% of initial ATP, p < 0.05 compared with preconditioned hearts). SB202190 had no effect on 2DG6P accumulation in nonpreconditioned hearts. Preconditioning stimulation of translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane was not inhibited by wortmannin. The data demonstrate that ischemic preconditioning increases hexose transport and that this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase and is PI3K-independent.

A well studied regulator of glucose metabolism is insulin, which increases glucose transport by stimulating insertion of the glucose transporter (GLUT4) into the plasma membrane from an intracellular storage compartment (reviewed in Refs. 1.Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar and 2.Charron M.J. Katz E.B. Olson A.L. J. Biol.

Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 appears to be necessary for insulin-induced stimulation of glucose transport (3.Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

Overexpression of a membrane-targeted PI3K mimics the effect of insulin on glucose transport but not on glycogen synthase activity (6.Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R.

Thus the effects of insulin on glucose metabolism are primarily mediated through PI3K but other signaling pathways also appear to be involved. Glucose transport can also be enhanced by hypoxia by pathways independent of insulin and PI3K; however, the signaling pathways responsible are poorly understood (7.Egert S. Nguyen N. Brosius F.C.

In skeletal muscle, hypoxia and contraction have been shown to increase glucose transport and translocation of glucose transporters (13.Cartee G.D. Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) by a mechanism that is not inhibited by wortmannin (14.Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, contraction does not activate PKB (16.Brozinick Jr., J.T. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14679-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or PI3K (17.Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Balon T.W. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E987-E995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly in heart, ischemia causes an increase in glucose uptake that is not inhibited by wortmannin (7.Egert S. Nguyen N. Brosius F.C. Schwaiger M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 35: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters also increase glucose transport by a mechanism that is not inhibited by wortmannin (8.Hansen P.A. Corbett J.A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E28-E36PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Todaka M. Hayashi H. Imanaka T. Mitani Y. Kamohara S. Kishi K. Tamaoka K. Kanai F. Shichiri M. Morii N. Narumiya S. Ebina Y. Biochem.

Sorisky A. Nagy L. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, unlike contraction (16.Brozinick Jr., J.T. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 268: E987-E995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tyrosine kinase inhibition does appear to activate PI3K, although this activation is not required for GLUT4 translocation (19.Tsiani E. Bogdanovic E. Sorisky A. Nagy L. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). β-Adrenergic agonists are also reported to increase glucose transport by a wortmannin-insensitive pathway (11.Han X.X. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E700-E707PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Fischer Y. Kamp J. Thomas J. Popping S. Rose H. Carpene C. Kammermeier H. Am. J.

In adipocytes, Shimizu et al. (20.Shimizu Y. Satoh S. Yano H. Minokoshi Y. Cushman S.W. Shimazu T. Biochem J. 1998; 330: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have reported that norepinephrine causes an increase in glucose transport without an increase in translocation of glucose transporter but rather by increasing the activity of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane. The PI3K-independent pathway(s) responsible for glucose transporter translocation have not been identified, but nitric oxide (10.Roberts C.K. Barnard R.J. Scheck S.H. Balon T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E220-E225PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (22.Henriksen E.J. Sleeper M.D. Zierath J.R. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E662-E667PubMed Google Scholar) have been suggested to be involved. Thus multiple signaling pathways can result in glucose transporter translocation. In addition to PI3K-independent pathways leading to increased glucose transporter translocation, there are PI3K-independent mechanisms that enhance activity of glucose transporters present in the plasma membrane (23.Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24.Barros L.F. Young M. Saklatvala J. Baldwin S.A. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that insulin-stimulated glucose transport is regulated not only by translocation of transporters, which in the case of insulin is mediated by PI3K, but also by activation of transporters after they are inserted into the plasma membrane, which requires p38 MAP kinase (23.Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Anisomycin, an activator of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 MAP kinase, stimulates glucose transport by a mechanism that does not involve enhanced translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane but rather stimulates transporters already in the plasma membrane (24.Barros L.F. Young M. Saklatvala J. Baldwin S.A. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Brief intermittent periods of ischemia and reflow, termed ischemic preconditioning, have been shown to protect the myocardium against injury produced by a subsequent sustained period of ischemia (25.Murry C.E. Richard V.J. Remier K.A. Jennings R.B. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 26.Liu Y. Downey J.M. Am. J.

Preconditioning has been shown to significantly reduce infarct size, arrhythmias, and postischemic contractile dysfunction (25.Murry C.E. Richard V.J. Remier K.A. Jennings R.B. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 26.Liu Y. Downey J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H1107-H1112PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Steenbergen C. Perlman M.E. London R.E.

Anderson G.M. Mentzer Jr., R.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Intense investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of preconditioning has revealed numerous potential mediators and downstream effectors of preconditioning, but cause and effect relationships have not been fully delineated. Preconditioning has been shown to reduce the production of lactate (25.Murry C.E. Richard V.J. Remier K.A. Jennings R.B. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) and to attenuate the fall in intracellular pH during the sustained period of ischemia (27.Steenbergen C. Perlman M.E. London R.E. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 112-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations would suggest that glucose utilization is decreased during ischemia in preconditioned hearts. However, there also are data to suggest that preconditioning enhances glucose uptake (30.Weiss R.G. deAlbuquerque C.P. Vandegaer K. Chacko V.P. Gerstenblith G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31.Janier M.F. Vanoverschelde J.-L. Bergmann S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1353-H1360PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether preconditioning enhanced glucose transport during subsequent reflow periods and whether the effects of preconditioning involved either PI3K or p38 MAP kinase. We report that preconditioning stimulates glucose uptake, but this enhanced glucose uptake is not blocked by the inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin. However, the preconditioning induced increase in glucose uptake is blocked by the addition of SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, suggesting a role for p38 MAP kinase in the stress-induced stimulation of glucose transport. Preconditioning stimulates translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, but this translocation is not blocked by wortmannin. In this study, all rats received humane care in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (53.National Institutes of HealthGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, 1985Google Scholar). Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (170–250 g) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbitone (∼25 mg). The animals were heparinized (200 units intravenously), the heart was rapidly excised, and the aorta was cannulated. Retrograde perfusion was begun under constant pressure (90 cm of H2O). The nonrecirculating perfusate was a Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KH) containing: 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose. The buffer was maintained at pH 7.4 by bubbling with a mixture of 95% O2/5% CO2 and at a temperature of 37 °C. 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG), an analog of glucose, is transported into the cell by the glucose transporter and is phosphorylated by hexokinase, resulting in the formation of 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate (2DG6P). The latter cannot leave the cell and is metabolized very slowly; hence its accumulation provides a measure of glucose uptake and phosphorylation (32.Murphy E. Fralix T.A. London R.E. Steenbergen C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1146-C1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat hearts were perfused with phosphate-containing Krebs-Henseleit buffer using acetate (5 mm) as the sole exogenous substrate for ATP production. 2DG (5 mm) was added to the perfusate, and 2DG6P production was monitored by 31P NMR expressed as a percentage of the initial ATP content prior to any intervention, drug treatment, or the addition of 2DG. Rat hearts were placed in a 20-mm NMR tube and bathed in perfusate for optimal magnetic susceptibility matching.31P NMR spectra were obtained at 161.9 MHz using a Varian Unity Plus 400 MHz wide bore NMR spectrometer. The temperature of the heart was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C by the variable temperature unit of the Varian spectrometer. We shimmed on the proton signal from the heart and routinely obtained a nonspinning line width at one-half height of ∼0.2 ppm. Spectra were acquired every 2 min using a 2-s interval between scans with a pulse angle of 70° (33 μs). The spectral width was ± 3603 Hz, and 4000 data points were collected. The free induction decay was multiplied by an exponential function corresponding to a 20-Hz line broadening before Fourier transformation. To determine whether preconditioning stimulates glucose transport and whether this stimulation is affected by inhibition of p38 MAP kinase or PI3K, nine groups of hearts were studied (Fig. 1). To assess hexose transport, 2DG6P production was measured during 20 min of perfusion with 2DG + acetate. In group I (control), hearts were perfused aerobically for 20 min with glucose and then were switched to 2DG + acetate buffer. Groups II (SB202190 (SB)) and III (wortmannin (WM)) were identical to group I, except 10 μm SB or 100 nm WM was present prior to and at the start of perfusion with 2DG + acetate. These concentrations were chosen based on those used previously (23.Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 33.Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Hearts were perfused for 15 min with glucose, and then SB202190 or wortmannin was added 10–15 min prior to perfusion with 2DG + acetate and remained for an additional 5 min during perfusion with 2DG + acetate. Hearts were then perfused for an additional 15 min with 2DG + acetate. In group IV (preconditioning), hearts were perfused with glucose containing buffer through 4 cycles of 5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion, and during the last reflow, the perfusate was shifted to 2DG + acetate. This reflow period was extended to 20 min to allow measurement of 2DG6P accumulation. Group V (PC+SB) was identical to group IV except that 10 μmSB202190 was added during the third reflow period of the preconditioning protocol (in the presence of glucose), and SB202190 was also present for the first 5 min of the final 20-min reflow period after the fourth cycle of preconditioning ischemia. Hearts were perfused with 2DG + acetate for the 20-min reflow period as in group IV. Group VI (PC+WM) was identical to group IV except 100 nm WM was added during the third reflow period of the preconditioning protocol (in the presence of glucose), and WM was also present for the first 5 min of the final 20-min reflow period after the fourth cycle of preconditioning ischemia. Group VII (PC+WM throughout) was identical to group IV except that 100 nm wortmannin was added 5 min prior to the start of the preconditioning protocol and was present throughout 4 cycles of preconditioning ischemia and reperfusion, including the first 5 min of the final 20-min reflow period. In group VIII (insulin), hearts were perfused for 10 min with KH, and then insulin was added for 10 min followed by perfusion with 2DG + acetate without insulin. Group IX (insulin + WM) was identical to group VIII except that 100 nm WM was added 5 min prior to and continued during the addition of insulin. Five groups of rat hearts were snap frozen for phospho-PKB analysis at the end of the treatment period. Control hearts were frozen after 60 min of control perfusion with KH. PC hearts were frozen at the end of the fourth 5-min reflow of the preconditioning protocol. PC+WM hearts were treated with WM throughout PC and were frozen at the end of the fourth reflow of PC. WM-treated hearts were frozen after 20 min of perfusion with KH followed by 25 min of WM perfusion. Insulin-treated hearts were frozen after 30 min of perfusion with KH followed by 15 min of perfusion with insulin (5 IU/liter). Frozen hearts were powdered in a prechilled mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen. Ice-cold lysis buffer (75 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, pH 7.7) was added to the powdered tissue. The homogenate was centrifuged at 45,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of supernatant containing equal amounts of protein (Pierce protein assay) were boiled in sample loading buffer for 5 min before loading on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and semi-dry transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween-20 (TBST; 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4). The membranes were incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST containing phospho-PKB polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h and then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody in TBST for 1 h. Finally, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescence reagent and quantified by densitometry. The activity of p38 MAP kinase was measured in tissue homogenates using a commercial kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Hearts were snap frozen and homogenized as described by Bogoyevitch et al. (34.Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J. Fuller S.J. Ben-Levy R. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The activity of p38 MAP kinase in the homogenates was determined by measuring the p38 MAP kinase activation of MAPKAP kinase-2, which can transfer the γ phosphate of [γ-32P]ATP to a specific peptide substrate. The phosphorylated substrate is then separated from the residual [γ-32P]ATP by differential binding to P81 phosphocellulose paper. After extensive washing of the phosphocellulose paper with phosphoric acid, the bound radioactivity is determined by liquid scintillation counting. Activity was normalized to protein. Negative controls were performed without substrate peptide and with unactivated MAPKAP kinase-2. Four groups of hearts were studied. A group of control hearts was frozen after 30 min of aerobic perfusion. The PC hearts were frozen after preconditioning with four cycles of 5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reflow. The PC+SB hearts were frozen after preconditioning with four cycles of ischemia/reperfusion with 10 μm SB202190 added to the perfusate during the third reflow period and present in the perfusate throughout the 4th reflow period of the preconditioning protocol, and the SB hearts were frozen after 20 min of perfusion with KH followed by 10 min of treatment with 10 μm SB202190. At the end of the treatment period, prior to ischemia, rat hearts were snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Four groups of rat hearts were included in the subcellular membrane fractionation study. Control hearts were frozen after 60 min of control perfusion. PC hearts were frozen at the end of the fourth 5-min reflow. PC+WM hearts were treated with WM throughout PC and were frozen at the end of the fourth reflow of PC. Insulin-treated hearts were frozen after 30 min of perfusion with KH followed by 15 min of perfusion with insulin (5 IU/liter). Membrane fractionation was performed using a modification of the method of Rett et al. (35.Rett K. Wicklmayr M. Dietze G.J. Haring H.U. Diabetes. 1996; 45 Suppl. 1: S66-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hearts were powdered with a prechilled mortar and pestle and dissolved in ice-cold buffer (0.2m Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 255 mmsucrose, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4). The homogenates were centrifuged at 8700 × g for 20 min. The supernatant, containing intracellular membranes, was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged again for 60 min at 293,000 × g. The pellet obtained with the first centrifugation was resuspended in buffer, homogenized again in a dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged twice at 750 × g and 270 × g for 10 min each. The resulting supernatants from the two centrifugations were combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged again at 48,000 ×g for 60 min. The pellet, containing plasma membranes, was resuspended in buffer and layered on a 38.3% sucrose gradient and was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 50 min. The interphase was collected and centrifuged again at 183,000 × g for 40 min. GLUT4, in both the intracellular and plasma membranes, was measured by Western blotting. Na,K-ATPase-α1 was also measured to confirm the purity and lack of contamination of the fractions. The plasma membrane fractions from the four groups of hearts showed similar levels of Na,K-ATPase. Protein samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST, and the membrane subsequently was incubated with antibodies against GLUT1 and GLUT4 at a dilution of 1:500 in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 1 h and with Na,K-ATPase-α1antibody with a dilution of 1:5000 in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST. The membrane was then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody for GLUT1 and GLUT4 and in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anit-mouse antibody for Na,K-ATPase-α1 in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST. Finally, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescence reagent and quantified by densitometry. SB202190 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted to the final concentration with perfusate immediately before use. Wortmannin (Calbiochem) was made up as a 1 mm stock in Me2SO and diluted in buffer immediately before use. The phospho-PKB antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA, and the GLUT1 and GLUT4 antibodies were obtained from Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX. Na,K-ATPase-α1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from either Sigma or Calbiochem. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by a Systat 5 program using fully factorial (M)ANOVA. When the analysis of variance demonstrated that significant differences existed, a post hoc test (Fisher) was performed. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To investigate directly whether brief intermittent periods of ischemia and reperfusion stimulate glucose uptake, we used31P NMR to monitor the uptake and phosphorylation of the glucose analog, 2DG, which is phosphorylated and accumulated as 2DG6P when perfusate glucose is replaced with 2DG and acetate. Hearts were perfused (see Fig. 1) with 2DG and acetate (the latter to provide substrate for mitochondrial respiration) under control conditions and following insulin addition or preconditioning; in the latter protocol, the glucose was replaced with 2DG and acetate during the fourth reflow of the preconditioning protocol. Fig. 2, A andB, shows typical 31P NMR spectra demonstrating that preconditioning enhanced 2DG6P production. Fig. 2, Aand B, shows resonance peaks for 2DG6P, the extracellular and intracellular inorganic phosphate (ext. Pi and int. Pi, respectively), phosphocreatine, and the γ, α, and β phosphate resonances of ATP. 2DG6P is normally not present in the heart, but on the addition of 2DG to the perfusate, the 2DG is transported into the myocytes and phosphorylated, and the 2DG6P is trapped intracellularly. The resulting accumulation of 2DG6P allows us to quantify the rate of this process as a function of time, which is manifest by an increase in the 2DG6P resonance peak height and area. We normalize the 2DG6P peak area to the area under the initial β-ATP resonance peak prior to any treatment and prior to addition of 2DG, and these data are presented in Fig. 2 C, which summarizes data from multiple hearts. After 15 min of perfusion with 2DG and acetate, 2DG6P levels were 96 ± 15% of the initial ATP in control hearts compared with 165 ± 13% of the initial ATP in preconditioned hearts (p < 0.05, Fig. 2 C). We were interested in investigating the signaling pathway(s) involved in this increase in glucose transport observed in preconditioned hearts. Insulin stimulation of glucose transport is mediated by a PI3K-sensitive pathway (1.Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2085448417,"Cyclin D1 binds and regulates the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6. Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin D1·CDK4/6 complexes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle promotes entry into S phase. Cyclin D1 protein is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclin D1 ubiquitination is dependent on its phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) on threonine 286 and that this phosphorylation event is greatly enhanced by binding to CDK4 (Diehl, J. A., Cheng, M. G., Roussel, M. F., and Sherr, C. J. (1998) Genes Dev. 12, 3499–3511). We now report an additional pathway for the ubiquitination of free cyclin D1 (unbound to CDKs). We show that, when unbound to CDK4, a cyclin D1-T286A mutant is ubiquitinated. Further, we show that a mutant of cyclin D1 that cannot bind to CDK4 (cyclin D1-KE) is also ubiquitinated in vivo. Our results demonstrate that free cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of its phosphorylation on threonine 286 by GSK-3β, suggesting that, as has been shown for cyclin E, distinct pathways of ubiquitination lead to the degradation of free and CDK-bound cyclin D1.

The pathway responsible for ubiquitination of free cyclin D1 may be important in limiting the effects of cyclin D1 overexpression in a variety of cancers. cyclin-dependent kinase N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-N-norleucinal retinoblastoma protein hemagglutinin epitope glycogen synthase kinase 3β 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid glutathione S-transferase 35S-labeled Mammalian cell cycle progression is regulated by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).1 Among the cyclin subunits, D-type cyclins associate with CDK4 and -6 to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb promotes the release of the E2F family of transcription factors that then promote entry into S phase through activation of key target genes (1.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Although this function of cyclin D1 is well established, several recent observations suggest that additional roles may exist for free cyclin D1 in the regulation of transcription. First, cyclin D1 has been shown to associate with the estrogen receptor and to promote its transcriptional activity (2.Zwijsen R.M.L. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. Van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.A.A.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 3.Zwijsen R.M.L. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J.M. Bernards R.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Second, cyclin D1 has been shown to associate with the transcription factor DMP1 and to antagonize its ability to induce cell cycle arrest (5.Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Third, cyclin D1 was shown to affect the transcriptional activity of Sp1 (6.Adnane J. Shao Z. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the androgen receptor (7.Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar), and v-Myb (8.Ganter B. Fu S. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the impact of cyclin D1 interactions with these transcription factors remains to be demonstrated, the fact that the interactions are independent of binding to CDK4 suggests that cyclin D1 may affect cell cycle progression independently from its role in the regulation of CDKs and the phosphorylation of Rb.D-type cyclins have been suggested to be rate-limiting for the progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, based on the observation that their constitutive overexpression leads to a shorter G1 phase (9.Ando K. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9571-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10.Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.L. Buckley M.F. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8022-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Further, constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 in mouse mammary glands leads to carcinoma, indicating that cyclin D1 acts as an oncogene (11.Wang T. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In human breast cancer, abnormal accumulation of cyclin D1 is observed in as many as 35% of cases (12.Gillett C. Fantl V. Smith R. Fisher C. Bartek J. Dickson C. Barnes D. Peters G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1812-1817PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite overexpression of cyclin D1 gene, cyclin D1 protein accumulation remains modest because of the ubiquitination and rapid turnover of cyclin D1 by the 26 S proteasome (13.Russell A. Thompson A.M. Hendley J. Trute L. Armes J. Germain D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Linkage of ubiquitin to a protein requires the sequential action of the ubiquitin-SKP1 activating enzyme (E1), an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and an ubiquitin ligase (E3). The SCF complex is an ubiquitin ligase composed of three proteins:CKP1, a Cullin, Rbx 1, and an F-box protein (for a review, see Refs. 14.Krek W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 15.Craig K. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), where the F-box protein is thought to provide substrate specificity to the ligase complex (16.Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In yeast, the SCFGrr1 complex is responsible for the ubiquitination of the G1 cyclins Cln1 and Cln2 (18.Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenburg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 19.Barral Y. Jentsch S. Mann C.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3655-3661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although human cyclins D1 and D3 can both associate with the cullin Cul-1 (13.Russell A. Thompson A.M. Hendley J. Trute L. Armes J. Germain D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and expression of an antisense against the F-box protein SKP2 leads to the accumulation of cyclin D1 (22.Zhong-Kang Y. Gervais J.L.M. Zhang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11324-11329Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the direct involvement of these proteins in the ubiquitination of cyclin D1 remains to be demonstrated.Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on threonine 286 is required for its ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation in the cytoplasm (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar,24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is mediated by the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and is greatly enhanced by the binding of cyclin D1 to CDK4 (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). We report here that non-CDK4-bound cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of phosphorylation on threonine 286. These results indicate that, as has been shown for cyclin E (25.Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), distinct pathways exist for the ubiquitination of free and bound cyclin D1. This mechanism may have an important role in limiting the level of free cyclin D1 and hence in negatively regulating G1/S cell cycle progression.DISCUSSIONThis study describes an in vitro ubiquitination assay for cyclin D1 and provides evidence that free cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of phosphorylation on threonine 286. Thein vitro assay requires protein extract from cells that are proficient in cyclin D1 proteolysis in vivo and is therefore representative of the ubiquitination capacity of the extract being tested. Further, as observed in vivo (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), the in vitro ubiquitination leads predominantly to the formation of very high molecular weight forms of cyclin D1. The efficiency of the ubiquitination is reflected by the accumulation of ubiquitinated species in the stacking gel, a feature that was also observed in other in vitro ubiquitination assays (28.Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that long polyubiquitin chains are attached to cyclin D1. The length of the polyubiquitin chains could not be reduced by the presence of excess methylated ubiquitin, suggesting that preformed polyubiquitin chains are transferred onto cyclin D1. The presence of these preformed polyubiquitin chains has been documented (29.Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).We show that threonine 286 and 288 of human cyclin D1 are important residues that affect the rate of proteolysis. However, as mutation of these residues did not entirely abolish the ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin D1, our results revealed a residual activity, which is independent of phosphorylation at these residues. This observation was confirmed using the in vitro ubiquitination assay, in which cyclin D1-T286A-T288A mutant was found to be a substrate for ubiquitination. Further, we showed that in vitro cyclin D1 is not bound to CDK4 and that in vivo a mutant of cyclin D1 that is unable to bind CDK4 (cyclin D1-KE) is ubiquitinated at a level similar to wild type cyclin D1. Our observations indicate that although GSK-3β can phosphorylate free cyclin D1 to some extent (24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar), this phosphorylation is not required for the ubiquitination of free cyclin D1. Further, we show that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by GSK-3β does not promotes its dissociation from CDK4. Therefore, our results suggest that two distinct pathways exist for the ubiquitination of cyclin D1. One pathway, which is GSK-3β-independent, targets free cyclin D1 for ubiquitination. The second is a GSK-3β-dependent pathway targeting CDK4-bound cyclin D1 for degradation. Previous observations indicated that in UMSCC2 cells, which overexpress cyclin D1 because of the amplification of the cyclin D1 gene, the small fraction of cyclin D1 that co-immunoprecipitates with CDK6 was more stable than the fraction immunoprecipitated with cyclin D1 antiserum (27.Bates S. Parry D. Bonetta L. Vousden K. Dickson K. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar). Further, in Rb-negative cells, where cyclin D1 is free from CDK4, cyclin D1 turnover was found to be more rapid than that in Rb-positive cells where cyclin D1 is bound to CDK4. These results indicate that unbound cyclin D1 is degraded more rapidly than bound cyclin D1 (27.Bates S. Parry D. Bonetta L. Vousden K. Dickson K. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results are consistent with our finding that free cyclin D1 is a substrate for ubiquitination, we did not observe a more rapid degradation of free cyclin D1-KE compared with wild type cyclin D1. This discrepancy may indicate that the pathway responsible for the degradation of free cyclin D1 is more predominant in some cellular types than others.What is the advantage of having distinct ubiquitination pathways for free and CDK4-bound cyclin D1? Interestingly, because the cyclin D1-T286A mutant is stabilized when bound to CDK4 (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), it appears that binding to CDK4 protects cyclin D1 from degradation by the GSK-3β-independent ubiquitination pathway. This protection mechanism may be important in regulating the cyclin D1 function, as it would ensure sufficient stability for the cyclin D1·CDK4 complex to perform its function during G1 phase. However, upon translocation of GSK-3β into the nucleus in S phase (24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar), the ubiquitination of CDK4-bound cyclin D1 is initiated, because the cyclin D1·CDK4 complex function is no longer required. Therefore, the GSK-3β-dependent ubiquitination pathway ensures a regulated destruction of CDK4-bound cyclin D1 at the G1/S boundary.The GSK-3β independent ubiquitination pathway may have a distinct role in the regulation of cyclin D1. Considering the growing evidence for the functions of non-CDK bound cyclin D1 in the activation of a variety of transcription factors (2.Zwijsen R.M.L. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. Van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.A.A.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 3.Zwijsen R.M.L. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4.Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. Direnzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), the GSK-3β-independent ubiquitination pathway may be important for the constitutive destruction of free cyclin D1, thereby preventing its accumulation in the nucleus during G1. This model is consistent with the observation that, in most cases, little free cyclin D1 is found in cells. The constitutive degradation of free cyclin D1 may be particularly important in limiting the effect of cyclin D1 overexpression observed in 35% of breast cancers (12.Gillett C. Fantl V. Smith R. Fisher C. Bartek J. Dickson C. Barnes D. Peters G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1812-1817PubMed Google Scholar). The situation in these tumors is similar to that of UMSCC2 cells, which overexpress cyclin D1 because of the amplification of the cyclin D1 gene, but in which most of the cyclin D1 is found unbound to CDKs (27.Bates S. Parry D. Bonetta L. Vousden K. Dickson K. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore potentially able to modulate various transcriptional activities.Our results also show similarities to the recent finding that cyclin E is degraded by two mechanisms. Free cyclin E is degraded independently of phosphorylation on threonine 380 by CDK2 and involves Cul-3 (25.Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), whereas ubiquitination of CDK2 bound cyclin E requires phosphorylation at that residue and involves Cul-1 (30.Wang Y. Penfold S. Tang X. Hattori N. Riley P. Harper J.W. Cross J.C. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1191-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31.Dealy M.J. Nguyen K.V. Lo J. Gstaiger M. Krek W. Elson D. Arbeit J. Kipreos E.T. Johnson R.S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Together, the findings that free and bound cyclin E and cyclin D1 ubiquitination pathways differ indicates that cellular mechanisms have evolved to tightly control the level of G1 cyclins. We have previously obtained evidence that ubiquitination of cyclin D1 may be defective in 15% of breast cancer (13.Russell A. Thompson A.M. Hendley J. Trute L. Armes J. Germain D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and so the challenge ahead is to determine which ubiquitination pathway is defective in these tumors. Mammalian cell cycle progression is regulated by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).1 Among the cyclin subunits, D-type cyclins associate with CDK4 and -6 to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb promotes the release of the E2F family of transcription factors that then promote entry into S phase through activation of key target genes (1.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Although this function of cyclin D1 is well established, several recent observations suggest that additional roles may exist for free cyclin D1 in the regulation of transcription. First, cyclin D1 has been shown to associate with the estrogen receptor and to promote its transcriptional activity (2.Zwijsen R.M.L. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. Van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.A.A.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 3.Zwijsen R.M.L. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J.M. Bernards R.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Second, cyclin D1 has been shown to associate with the transcription factor DMP1 and to antagonize its ability to induce cell cycle arrest (5.Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Third, cyclin D1 was shown to affect the transcriptional activity of Sp1 (6.Adnane J. Shao Z. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the androgen receptor (7.Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar), and v-Myb (8.Ganter B. Fu S. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the impact of cyclin D1 interactions with these transcription factors remains to be demonstrated, the fact that the interactions are independent of binding to CDK4 suggests that cyclin D1 may affect cell cycle progression independently from its role in the regulation of CDKs and the phosphorylation of Rb. D-type cyclins have been suggested to be rate-limiting for the progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, based on the observation that their constitutive overexpression leads to a shorter G1 phase (9.Ando K. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9571-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10.Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.L. Buckley M.F. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8022-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Further, constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 in mouse mammary glands leads to carcinoma, indicating that cyclin D1 acts as an oncogene (11.Wang T. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In human breast cancer, abnormal accumulation of cyclin D1 is observed in as many as 35% of cases (12.Gillett C. Fantl V. Smith R. Fisher C. Bartek J. Dickson C. Barnes D. Peters G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1812-1817PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite overexpression of cyclin D1 gene, cyclin D1 protein accumulation remains modest because of the ubiquitination and rapid turnover of cyclin D1 by the 26 S proteasome (13.Russell A. Thompson A.M. Hendley J. Trute L. Armes J. Germain D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Linkage of ubiquitin to a protein requires the sequential action of the ubiquitin-SKP1 activating enzyme (E1), an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and an ubiquitin ligase (E3). The SCF complex is an ubiquitin ligase composed of three proteins:CKP1, a Cullin, Rbx 1, and an F-box protein (for a review, see Refs. 14.Krek W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 15.Craig K. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), where the F-box protein is thought to provide substrate specificity to the ligase complex (16.Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M.

In yeast, the SCFGrr1 complex is responsible for the ubiquitination of the G1 cyclins Cln1 and Cln2 (18.Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenburg C.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3655-3661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although human cyclins D1 and D3 can both associate with the cullin Cul-1 (13.Russell A. Thompson A.M. Hendley J. Trute L. Armes J. Germain D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and expression of an antisense against the F-box protein SKP2 leads to the accumulation of cyclin D1 (22.Zhong-Kang Y. Gervais J.L.M. Zhang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11324-11329Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the direct involvement of these proteins in the ubiquitination of cyclin D1 remains to be demonstrated. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on threonine 286 is required for its ubiquitination, nuclear export, and degradation in the cytoplasm (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar,24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is mediated by the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and is greatly enhanced by the binding of cyclin D1 to CDK4 (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). We report here that non-CDK4-bound cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of phosphorylation on threonine 286. These results indicate that, as has been shown for cyclin E (25.Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), distinct pathways exist for the ubiquitination of free and bound cyclin D1. This mechanism may have an important role in limiting the level of free cyclin D1 and hence in negatively regulating G1/S cell cycle progression. DISCUSSIONThis study describes an in vitro ubiquitination assay for cyclin D1 and provides evidence that free cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of phosphorylation on threonine 286. Thein vitro assay requires protein extract from cells that are proficient in cyclin D1 proteolysis in vivo and is therefore representative of the ubiquitination capacity of the extract being tested. Further, as observed in vivo (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), the in vitro ubiquitination leads predominantly to the formation of very high molecular weight forms of cyclin D1. The efficiency of the ubiquitination is reflected by the accumulation of ubiquitinated species in the stacking gel, a feature that was also observed in other in vitro ubiquitination assays (28.Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that long polyubiquitin chains are attached to cyclin D1. The length of the polyubiquitin chains could not be reduced by the presence of excess methylated ubiquitin, suggesting that preformed polyubiquitin chains are transferred onto cyclin D1. The presence of these preformed polyubiquitin chains has been documented (29.Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).We show that threonine 286 and 288 of human cyclin D1 are important residues that affect the rate of proteolysis. However, as mutation of these residues did not entirely abolish the ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin D1, our results revealed a residual activity, which is independent of phosphorylation at these residues. This observation was confirmed using the in vitro ubiquitination assay, in which cyclin D1-T286A-T288A mutant was found to be a substrate for ubiquitination. Further, we showed that in vitro cyclin D1 is not bound to CDK4 and that in vivo a mutant of cyclin D1 that is unable to bind CDK4 (cyclin D1-KE) is ubiquitinated at a level similar to wild type cyclin D1. Our observations indicate that although GSK-3β can phosphorylate free cyclin D1 to some extent (24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar), this phosphorylation is not required for the ubiquitination of free cyclin D1. Further, we show that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by GSK-3β does not promotes its dissociation from CDK4. Therefore, our results suggest that two distinct pathways exist for the ubiquitination of cyclin D1. One pathway, which is GSK-3β-independent, targets free cyclin D1 for ubiquitination. The second is a GSK-3β-dependent pathway targeting CDK4-bound cyclin D1 for degradation. Previous observations indicated that in UMSCC2 cells, which overexpress cyclin D1 because of the amplification of the cyclin D1 gene, the small fraction of cyclin D1 that co-immunoprecipitates with CDK6 was more stable than the fraction immunoprecipitated with cyclin D1 antiserum (27.Bates S. Parry D. Bonetta L. Vousden K. Dickson K. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar). Further, in Rb-negative cells, where cyclin D1 is free from CDK4, cyclin D1 turnover was found to be more rapid than that in Rb-positive cells where cyclin D1 is bound to CDK4. These results indicate that unbound cyclin D1 is degraded more rapidly than bound cyclin D1 (27.Bates S. Parry D. Bonetta L. Vousden K. Dickson K. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results are consistent with our finding that free cyclin D1 is a substrate for ubiquitination, we did not observe a more rapid degradation of free cyclin D1-KE compared with wild type cyclin D1. This discrepancy may indicate that the pathway responsible for the degradation of free cyclin D1 is more predominant in some cellular types than others.What is the advantage of having distinct ubiquitination pathways for free and CDK4-bound cyclin D1? Interestingly, because the cyclin D1-T286A mutant is stabilized when bound to CDK4 (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), it appears that binding to CDK4 protects cyclin D1 from degradation by the GSK-3β-independent ubiquitination pathway. This protection mechanism may be important in regulating the cyclin D1 function, as it would ensure sufficient stability for the cyclin D1·CDK4 complex to perform its function during G1 phase. However, upon translocation of GSK-3β into the nucleus in S phase (24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar), the ubiquitination of CDK4-bound cyclin D1 is initiated, because the cyclin D1·CDK4 complex function is no longer required. Therefore, the GSK-3β-dependent ubiquitination pathway ensures a regulated destruction of CDK4-bound cyclin D1 at the G1/S boundary.The GSK-3β independent ubiquitination pathway may have a distinct role in the regulation of cyclin D1. Considering the growing evidence for the functions of non-CDK bound cyclin D1 in the activation of a variety of transcription factors (2.Zwijsen R.M.L. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. Van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.A.A.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 3.Zwijsen R.M.L. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J.M. Bernards R.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), the GSK-3β-independent ubiquitination pathway may be important for the constitutive destruction of free cyclin D1, thereby preventing its accumulation in the nucleus during G1. This model is consistent with the observation that, in most cases, little free cyclin D1 is found in cells. The constitutive degradation of free cyclin D1 may be particularly important in limiting the effect of cyclin D1 overexpression observed in 35% of breast cancers (12.Gillett C. Fantl V. Smith R. Fisher C. Bartek J. Dickson C. Barnes D. Peters G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1812-1817PubMed Google Scholar). The situation in these tumors is similar to that of UMSCC2 cells, which overexpress cyclin D1 because of the amplification of the cyclin D1 gene, but in which most of the cyclin D1 is found unbound to CDKs (27.Bates S. Parry D. Bonetta L. Vousden K. Dickson K. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore potentially able to modulate various transcriptional activities.Our results also show similarities to the recent finding that cyclin E is degraded by two mechanisms. Free cyclin E is degraded independently of phosphorylation on threonine 380 by CDK2 and involves Cul-3 (25.Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), whereas ubiquitination of CDK2 bound cyclin E requires phosphorylation at that residue and involves Cul-1 (30.Wang Y. Penfold S. Tang X. Hattori N. Riley P. Harper J.W. Cross J.C. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1191-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31.Dealy M.J. Nguyen K.V. Lo J. Gstaiger M. Krek W. Elson D. Arbeit J. Kipreos E.T. Johnson R.S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Together, the findings that free and bound cyclin E and cyclin D1 ubiquitination pathways differ indicates that cellular mechanisms have evolved to tightly control the level of G1 cyclins. We have previously obtained evidence that ubiquitination of cyclin D1 may be defective in 15% of breast cancer (13.Russell A. Thompson A.M. Hendley J. Trute L. Armes J. Germain D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and so the challenge ahead is to determine which ubiquitination pathway is defective in these tumors. This study describes an in vitro ubiquitination assay for cyclin D1 and provides evidence that free cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of phosphorylation on threonine 286. Thein vitro assay requires protein extract from cells that are proficient in cyclin D1 proteolysis in vivo and is therefore representative of the ubiquitination capacity of the extract being tested. Further, as observed in vivo (23.Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), the in vitro ubiquitination leads predominantly to the formation of very high molecular weight forms of cyclin D1. The efficiency of the ubiquitination is reflected by the accumulation of ubiquitinated species in the stacking gel, a feature that was also observed in other in vitro ubiquitination assays (28.Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that long polyubiquitin chains are attached to cyclin D1. The length of the polyubiquitin chains could not be reduced by the presence of excess methylated ubiquitin, suggesting that preformed polyubiquitin chains are transferred onto cyclin D1. The presence of these preformed polyubiquitin chains has been documented (29.Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We show that threonine 286 and 288 of human cyclin D1 are important residues that affect the rate of proteolysis. However, as mutation of these residues did not entirely abolish the ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin D1, our results revealed a residual activity, which is independent of phosphorylation at these residues. This observation was confirmed using the in vitro ubiquitination assay, in which cyclin D1-T286A-T288A mutant was found to be a substrate for ubiquitination. Further, we showed that in vitro cyclin D1 is not bound to CDK4 and that in vivo a mutant of cyclin D1 that is unable to bind CDK4 (cyclin D1-KE) is ubiquitinated at a level similar to wild type cyclin D1. Our observations indicate that although GSK-3β can phosphorylate free cyclin D1 to some extent (24.Diehl J.A. Cheng M.G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

The successful diagnostic use of PSA in prostate cancer suggests that other related or unrelated molecules might be discovered and serve as diagnostic tests for breast, ovarian, and other cancers. In addition to PSA, human glandular kallikrein 2 (encoded by the KLK2 gene) may be useful as an adjuvant diagnostic marker for prostate cancer (10.Stenman U.H. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 753-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that some members of the kallikrein gene family are implicated in carcinogenesis. The normal epithelial cell-specific 1 gene (NES1) was found to be a tumor suppressor (11.Goyal J. Smith K.M. Cowan J.M. Wazer D.E. Lee S.W. Band V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4782-4786PubMed Google Scholar) that is down-regulated during breast cancer progression. The zyme/protease M/neurosin gene is expressed in primary breast cancers but is down-regulated at metastatic sites (4.Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol.

The large size of the kallikrein gene family in other species, such as rat and mouse, where kallikreins are encoded by 13–24 genes (12.Evans B.A. Drinkwater C.C. Richards R.I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4520-5427Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the recent identification of new kallikrein-like genes suggested that the human kallikrein gene family may be larger than previously thought. The rodent kallikrein genes are located in clusters on chromosome 7, and the region between two mouse kallikrein genes in a cluster can be as small as 3–7 kb (14.Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J.

In our efforts to identify new kallikrein-like genes that might be useful as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for cancer, we studied a genomic area of ∼300 kb around chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4, where the known human kallikrein genes are localized. We were able to identify three new kallikrein-like genes; KLK-L1 (for kallikrein-like gene 1) (15.Yousef G. Obiezu C. Luo L. Black M.H. Diamandis E.P.

Here, we describe the cloning of a new kallikrein-like gene, named kallikrein-like gene 4 (KLK-L4), together with its precise chromosomal localization in relation to other kallikreins and its tissue expression pattern. We further describe identification of alternatively spliced forms of this gene in some tissues. We also provide preliminary evidence indicating that KLK-L4 is down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines and that it is hormonally regulated in the breast cancer cell line BT-474. We have obtained sequencing data of ∼300 kb of nucleotides, around chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4, from the web site of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and constructed an almost contiguous stretch of genomic sequences. A number of computer programs were used to predict the presence of putative new genes in this genomic area (16.Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Diamandis E.P. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 2843-2852PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted exons of the putative new gene were subjected to homology search using the BLASTN algorithm (18.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59892) Google Scholar) on the National Center for Biotechnology Information web server against the human EST data base (dbEST). Clones with >95% homology were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium (19.Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B.

The clones were propagated, purified, and sequenced from both directions with an automated sequencer using insert-flanking vector primers. According to the EST sequence data and the predicted structure of the gene, two gene-specific primers were designed, and two rounds of RACE reactions (nested PCR) were performed with 5 μl of Marathon Ready 228 cDNA of human testis (CLONTECH) as a template. The reaction mix and PCR conditions used were according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA isolated from 26 different human tissues was purchased from CLONTECH. We prepared cDNA as described below and used it for PCR reactions with different sets of primers (Table I).

Open table in a new tab The breast cancer cell line BT-474 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD. Cells were cultured in RPMI media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with glutamine (200 mmol/liter), bovine insulin (10 mg/liter), fetal bovine serum (10%), antibiotics, and antimycotics in plastic flasks to near confluency. The cells were then aliquoted into 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured to 50% confluency. 24 h before the experiments, the culture media were changed into phenol red-free media containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. For stimulation experiments, various steroid hormones dissolved in 100% ethanol were added into the culture media, at a final concentration of 10−8m. Cells stimulated with 100% ethanol were included as controls. The cells were cultured for 24 h and then harvested for mRNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the breast cancer tissues and cell lines using Trizol™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using the SuperscriptTMpreamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The final volume was 20 μl. Based on the combined information obtained from the predicted genomic structure of the new gene and the EST sequences, two gene-specific primers were designed (L4-F1 and L4-R1, see TableI) and PCR was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 1 μl of cDNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 150 ng of primers, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Systems) on a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 9 min to activate the Taq Gold DNA polymerase followed by 43 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 63 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. All primers for RT-PCR spanned at least 2 exons to avoid contamination by genomic DNA. To verify the identity of the PCR products, they were cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The inserts were sequenced from both directions using vector-specific primers with an automated DNA sequencer. Normal breast tissues were obtained from women undergoing reduction mammoplasties. Breast tumor tissues were obtained from female patients at participating hospitals of the Ontario Provincial Steroid Hormone Receptor Program. The normal and tumor tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after surgical resection and stored in this manner until extracted. The tissues were pulverized with a hammer at dry ice temperature, and RNA was extracted as described above, using Trizol reagent. Multiple alignment was performed using the Clustal X software package and the multiple alignment program available from the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Phylogenetic studies were performed using the Phylip software package. Distance matrix analysis was performed using the “Neighbor-Joining/UPGMA” program, and parsimony analysis was done using the “Protpars” program. The hydrophobicity study was performed using the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher programs. Signal peptide was predicted using the “SignalP” server. Protein structure analysis was performed by the “SAPS” (structural analysis of protein sequence) program. Computer analysis of the genomic sequence around chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 predicted a putative new gene formed of at least 3 exons. To experimentally verify the existence of this gene, the putative exons were subjected to sequence homology search against the human EST data base (dbEST), and four EST clones with >97% homology were identified (TableII). All ESTs were cloned from testicular tissue. These clones were obtained and inserts were sequenced from both directions. Sequences were then compared with the computer-predicted structure, and final selection of the intron/exon splice sites was made according to the EST sequences.Table IIEST clones with >95% homology to exons of KLK-L4GenBank™Tissue of originI.M.A.GE.

However, each of the ESTs extends further upstream with different exonic patterns, suggesting the presence of different splice variants. Attempts to translate these clone sequences demonstrated the presence, in some ESTs, of interrupting stop codons in all three possible reading frames. Homology search of the three common exons against the GenBankTM data base revealed a cDNA sequence from the German Human Genome Project. This clone has an identical exon 2 as the long form of KLK-L4 gene (this form will be described below) but has an extended exon 3 that ends with a stop codon (Fig. 1). This clone was isolated from uterine tissue and is translated by software into a truncated protein product of 196 amino acids, which is followed by a 3′-untranslated region (GenBankTM accession no.AL050220). Screening of cDNAs from 26 different tissues by RT-PCR, using gene-specific primers for exons 3 and 5 (L4-F1 and L4-R1) (Table I and Fig. 1), revealed that this gene is expressed in many tissues. Four tissues that show the highest level of expression (salivary gland, mammary gland, prostate, and testis (Fig.2)) and uterus (the EST clone AL050220was isolated from this tissue) were selected for identification of the full structure of the gene. Different PCR reactions were performed using one reverse primer (L4-R1) together with each of the forward primers located in upstream exons that were found in the different EST clones (primers L4-B, L4-D, L4-E) (Table I and Fig. 1). The PCR reactions were performed under different experimental conditions, using the EST clones as positive controls, and the PCR products were sequenced. None of these forms were found in any of the tissues, except in testis where all three forms were found (data not shown). By RT-PCR of the KLK-L4 gene using primers L4-R1 and L4-F1, it was found that the gene is expressed in a wide variety of tissues (Fig. 2). To obtain the structural forms that exist in these tissues, a homology study was performed. Aligning the predicted polypeptide of theKLK-L4 gene with all other kallikreins and kallikrein-like genes suggested, by homology, that at least two more exons should be present upstream of the predicted three exons. The genomic fragment upstream of the third exon was subjected to further computer analysis for gene prediction, and exon 2 was identified based on: (a) a consensus exon/intron splice site; (b) preservation intron phase II after this exon, in agreement to intron phases of all other known kallikreins (see “Discussion” for details); (c) presence of the histidine residue of the catalytic triad (His76) surrounded by a well conserved peptide motif (see below) just before the end of this exon; and (d) comparable exon length to other kallikrein genes. A potential first exon was also predicted from the upstream genomic sequence based on the preserved intron phase (phase I), and the existence of an in-frame start codon that is located at a comparable distance (in relation to other kallikreins) from the end of this exon. To verify this predicted structure, a PCR reaction was performed using one reverse primer (L4-R1) together with another forward primer that is located in the predicted first exon (primer L4-X1) (Table I and Fig. 1). Two main PCR bands were obtained from the tissues examined, the expected 819-bp band (predominant) and an additional minor band of about 650 bp (Fig.3). Cloning and sequencing of these two bands revealed that the gene exists in two main forms in these tissues; the long form (our GenBankTM submission AF135024) and another form (referred to as the short KLK-L4 variant) that utilizes an upstream alternative splice donor site located inside exon 3 thus creating an mRNA product that that is 214 bp shorter. This alternative splice site causes frame shifting of the coding region that will generate a predicted stop codon at the beginning of exon 4 giving rise to a truncated protein product that does not contain the serine residue of the catalytic triad (Figs. 3 and4).Figure 4Genomic organization and partial genomic sequence of the KLK-L4 gene.

These additional 80 bp contain an in-frame stop codon at nucleotide position 5505, which will lead to the formation of a shorter polypeptide product. They also utilize an alternative polyadenylation signal located at position 8706 (numbers refer to our GenBankTM submission AF135024). The clone from the German Genome Project utilizes another splice donor site that is located further downstream, inside intron 3 and ends up with a poly(A) tail without having a fourth or fifth exon. The same stop codon (position 5505) will be in-frame, and therefore, a truncated protein product is predicted to be formed (Fig. 1). To obtain the 3′-end of the gene, a 3′-RACE reaction was performed, and an additional 375-bp fragment of 3′-untranslated region, downstream from PCR primer L4-R1, was obtained. This fragment was further confirmed to be present in all tissues tested by performing a PCR reaction using primers L4-F1 and L4-R3 (Table I and Fig. 1). This fragment ends with a putative polyadenylation signal variant (TATAAA). The long form of the KLK-L4 gene is presented in Fig. 4. KLK-L4 is formed of five coding exons and four intervening introns, spanning an area of 8905 bp of genomic sequence on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. The lengths of the coding regions are 52, 187, 269, 137, and 189 bp, respectively. The predicted protein coding region of the gene is formed of 831 bp, encoding a deduced 277-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 30.6 kDa (Fig. 4). The intron/exon splice sites (mGT. . . . . AGm, where m is any base) and their flanking sequences are in agreement with the consensus splice site sequence (20.Iida Y. J. Theor. Biol. 1990; 145: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A potential translation initiation codon is present at position 45 of the predicted first exon (numbers refer to our GenBankTM submissionAF135024). The cDNA extends at least 382 bp further downstream from the stop codon, and a putative polyadenylation signal (TATAAA) is present at the end of this region (Fig. 4). Hydrophobicity analysis revealed that the amino-terminal region is quite hydrophobic (Fig. 5), consistent with the possibility that this region may harbor a signal sequence, analogous to other serine proteases. Fig. 5 also shows the presence of several evenly distributed hydrophobic regions throughout theKLK-L4 polypeptide, which are consistent with a globular protein, similar to other serine proteases (6.Liu X.L. Wazer D.E. Watanabe K. Band V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the amino acid sequence of KLK-L4 predicted a cleavage site between amino acids 20 and 21 (GVS-QE). Sequence homology with other serine proteases (Fig. 6) predicted another potential cleavage site (Lys25) in close proximity. Most other kallikreins are activated by cleavage after arginine or lysine (data not shown). Thus, although the protein product has not as yet been directly characterized, it is very likely to be a secreted protein. The dotted region in Fig. 6 indicates an 11-amino acid loop characteristic of the classical kallikreins (PSA, KLK1, andKLK2) that is not found in KLK-L4 or other members of the kallikrein multigene family (5.Little S.P.

Natl. Biomed. Res. Found. 1978; 5 Suppl. 3: 79-81Google Scholar). Twenty eight of them are conserved in the KLK-L4 protein and the remaining amino acid (Gln182 instead of Pro) is not conserved among all other kallikreins (Fig. 6). Ten cysteine residues are present in the putative mature KLK-L4 protein. These are conserved in all the serine proteases that are aligned in Fig. 6 and would be expected to form disulphide bridges. The presence of aspartate in position 239 suggests thatKLK-L4 will possess a trypsin-like cleavage pattern, similarly to most of the other kallikreins (e.g. KLK1, KLK2, TLSP, neuropsin, zyme, prostase, and enamel matrix serine proteinase) but different from PSA, which has a serine residue in the corresponding position and is known to have chymotrypsin-like activity (Fig. 6) (23.Clements J.

Alignment of the KLK-L4 gene and the sequences of other known kallikrein genes within the 300-kb area of interest (the human kallikrein gene family locus) enabled us to precisely localize all known genes and to determine the direction of transcription, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 7. The PSA gene lies between KLK1 and KLK2 genes and is separated by 13,319 bp from KLK2, and both genes are transcribed in the same direction (centromere to telomere). All other kallikrein-like genes are transcribed in the opposite direction.KLK-L4 is 13 kb centromeric from KLK-L6(GenBankTM accession AF161221), and 21 kb more telomeric to KLK-L5 (GenBankTM accession AF135025).2 Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the KLK-L4 protein (long form) against the GenBankTM data base and the known kallikreins, using the BLAST algorithm (18.Altschul S.F.

A multiple alignment study shows that the typical catalytic triad of serine proteases is conserved in the KLK-L4 gene (His108, Asp153, and Ser245), and as is the case with all other kallikreins, a well conserved peptide motif is found around the amino acid residues of the catalytic triad (i.e. histidine (WLLTAA H C), serine (GD S GGP), and aspartate ( D LMLI)) (Fig. 6) (2.Schedlich L.J.

In addition, several other residues were found to be fully or partially conserved among the human kallikrein gene family, as further shown in Fig. 6. To predict the phylogenetic relatedness of the KLK-L4 gene with other serine proteases, the amino acid sequences of the kallikrein genes were aligned together using the “Clustal X” multiple alignment program, and a distance matrix tree was predicted using the Neighbor-joining/UPGMA method (Fig.8). Phylogenetic analysis separated the classical kallikreins (KLK1, KLK2, and PSA) and grouped KLK-L4 with zyme, TLSP, KLK-L3, neuropsin, and NES1 genes, consistent with previously published studies (8.Nelson P.S.

https://openalex.org/W2070263067,"Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) is an actin-regulating protein that induces filopodium formation downstream of Cdc42. It has been shown that filopodia actively extend from the growth cone, a guidance apparatus located at the tip of neurites, suggesting their role in neurite extension. Here we examined the possible involvement of N-WASP in the neurite extension process. Since verprolin, cofilin homology andacidic region (VCA) of N-WASP is known to be required for the activation of Arp2/3 complex that induces actin polymerization, we prepared a mutant (Δcof) lacking four amino acid residues in the cofilin homology region. The corresponding residues in WASP had been reported to be mutated in some Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Expression of Δcof N-WASP suppressed neurite extension of PC12 cells. In support of this, the VCA region of Δcof cannot activate Arp2/3 complex enough compared with wild-type VCA. Furthermore, H208D mutant, which has been shown unable to bind to Cdc42, also works as a dominant negative mutant in neurite extension assay. Interestingly, the expression of H208D-Δcof double mutant has no significant dominant negative effect. Finally, the expression of the Δcof mutant also severely inhibited the neurite extension of primary neurons from rat hippocampus. Thus, N-WASP is thought to be a general regulator of the actin cytoskeleton indispensable for neurite extension, which is probably caused through Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization.

Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In the case of neural development, actin filaments have been shown to accumulate at the growth cone (3.Marsh L. Letourneau P.C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2041-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), a guidance apparatus located at the tip of growing neurites. It has long been suggested that the actin cytoskeletal reorganization at growth cones including filopodium and lammelipodium formation is the key determinant of the direction and/or speed of neurite extension. Thus, clarification of the regulatory mechanism behind the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons will ultimately lead to a better understanding of neural development. Evidence has been accumulating that Rho family small GTPases regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (4.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Indeed, two family members, Cdc42 and Rac, are shown to induce filopodium and lammelipodium formations, respectively (5.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 6.Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports demonstrated that their function is essential for neurite extension in N1E-115 and PC12 cells (8.Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 9.Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, the target proteins that function in neurite extension in neurons have yet to be identified. We found N-WASP as a 65-kDa protein that binds to the SH3 domains of Ash/Grb2 adaptor protein (10.Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). N-WASP possesses a GBD/CRIB motif through which N-WASP directly binds to activated Cdc42 (11.Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391 (96): 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In addition, N-WASP can induce filopodium formation downstream of Cdc42 in COS 7 cells (11.Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391 (96): 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). We have also shown that verprolin homology domain (V), which is an actin-binding site, is essential for filopodium formation (12.Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and cofilin homology domain (C) and the acidic (A) region in the C terminus are binding sites for Arp2/3 complex (13.Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhauzen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been made clear that Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization is markedly enhanced by N-WASP only in the presence of Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (13.Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhauzen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Considering that N-WASP was originally found and shown to be most abundant in brain (10.Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 14.Miura K. Miki H. Shimazaki K. Kawai N. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it is quite probable that N-WASP plays an important role in neurite extension. To examine this possibility, we prepared a mutant N-WASP (Δcof) that has mutations in the cofilin homology domain through which N-WASP regulates Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization. By expressing wild-type and Δcof N-WASP in PC12 cells and primary culture neurons obtained from rat hippocampus, we show here that N-WASP is a general regulator of neurite extension. The polyclonal anti-N-WASP1 antibody and the antibody specific for Arp3 were made, respectively, as described previously (10.Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T.

The secondary antibodies linked to alkaline phosphatase (used in Western blotting) and fluorescein (used in immunofluorescence microscopy) were from Promega and Cappel, respectively. The monoclonal antibody specific for neuronal class III β-tubulin and the polyclonal antibody specific for β-galactosidase were purchased from Berkeley Antibody Co. and Chemicon, respectively. Wild-type rat N-WASP cDNA has been isolated and reported previously (16.Fukuoka M. Miki H. Takenawa T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A mutant (H208D) in which a histidine residue (H) conserved in all the GBD/CRIB motifs is replaced by an aspartate (D) was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. Another mutant with deletion of the cofilin homology domain (Δcof; substituting amino acids Lys-Arg-Ser-Lys (473–476) for Asp-Ile (GATATC; EcoRV site)) was made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two sets of oligonucleotide primers (5′-CCGCTCGAGACCATGAGCTCGGGCCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGATATCCTGCATCACTTCCATCAGCGCA-3′ for the former half and 5′-CCCGATATCGCCATTCATTCCTCAGATGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGAATTCTCAGTCTTCCCACTCATCATCATC-3′ for the latter half). After the confirmation of the nucleotide sequences, the two PCR products were ligated at the EcoRV site. H208D mutant was made as described previously (11.Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391 (96): 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The double-mutated N-WASP (H208D-Δcof) was prepared from mutants H208D and Δcof by truncation and ligation atXbaI sites. The nucleotide sequences of all mutants were confirmed. The GST fusion proteins of the C-terminal region of wild-type N-WASP and Δcof (GST-VCA and GST-Δcof-VCA) were constructed, expressed, and purified as described previously (10.Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Each GST fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with protein samples (Arp2/3 complex or actin). Arp2/3 complex was isolated from bovine brain by the method described by Maet al. (17.Ma L. Rohatgi R. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After being washed, the beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis. Arp2/3-induced actin polymerization was measured as described previously (13.Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhauzen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 nm Arp2/3 complex and various amounts of GST-VCA or GST-Δcof-VCA were preincubated for 5 min in 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP·2Na, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% NaN3. The reaction was started by adding 2.2 μm actin (2.0 μm unlabeled actin + 0.2 μm pyrene actin), and fluorescence change was measured in a fluorometer. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrically transferred to a polyvinylidene membrane. After blocking with buffer (5% skimmed milk and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody, anti-N-WASP or anti-Arp3 antibody, and then with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Detection was done with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. PC12 cell culture was done as described previously (18.Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation was stimulated with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or with 1.0 mm Bt2cAMP·Na (Wako) and allowed to proceed for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Wild-type, H208D, Δcof, and H208D-Δcof N-WASP-expressing plasmids were constructed in pEF-BOS plasmid vectors, respectively. As a control vector, green fluorescent protein (GFP, CLONTECH)-expressing vector was also constructed. Two micrograms of each recombinant plasmid was transfected into PC12 cells (1 × 105 cells in 3.5-cm dish) with LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagents. For the Western blotting analysis, cells were harvested 72 h after the transfection. For the examination of neurite formation in PC12 cells, the differentiation was stimulated 48 h after the transfection. For preparing hippocampal primary culture cells, serum-free medium was used (19.Fischer G. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 28: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hippocampi were extracted from 1-day-old Wistar rats and dispersed by trypsin and DNase I in Hanks' balanced salt solution and then suspended in the medium. After filtration, cells were transferred into 8-well culture slides coated with polyethyleneimine at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/ml and grown for 24 h in the medium, and then adenovirus-mediated gene transduction was done. Cells were grown for 72 h after infection and then fixed. The recombinant adenoviruses that encode wild-type, Δcof N-WASP, and LacZ (β-galactosidase) were constructed by homologous recombination between the expression cosmid cassette pAxCAwt and the parental virus genome, as described previously (20.Miyake S.

For gene transduction, cells were incubated in 0.1 ml/well Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the adenoviruses for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the growing medium (0.6 ml/well) was added. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking with buffer (3% bovine serum albumin and 10% horse serum in PBS), cells were incubated with primary antibody, anti-N-WASP or anti-β-tubulin, followed by appropriate secondary antibodies linked to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Cappel) or Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To visualize actin filaments, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probe) was used. Cells expressing GFP were observed directly. A laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad) was used. N-WASP is an actin-regulating protein that was identified in brain. In the C-terminal region of N-WASP, there is a short peptide motif that is homologous to the highly conserved region in cofilin family proteins. WASP family proteins, such as WASP and N-WASP, have this domain (16.Fukuoka M. Miki H. Takenawa T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24.Symons M. Derry J.M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In cofilin homology domain, there is a part that consists of four amino acid residues from Lys-473 to Lys-476 and that is abundant in basicity. In some Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients, mutations at the basic amino acid residues among the four residues are also found (26.Derry J.M.J. Kerns J.A. Weinberg K.I. Ochs H.D. Volpini V. Estivill X. Walker A.P. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27.Kolluri R. Shehabeldin A. Peacocke M. Lamhonwah A.M. Teichert-Kuliszewska K. Weissman S.M.

Thus, we prepared a cofilin homology domain deletion mutant of N-WASP (Δcof) to examine the in vivo function of N-WASP, supposing it to be a dominant negative mutant. In Δcof, the schematic structure of which is shown in Fig. 2 A, the residues from Lys-473 to Lys-476 in the homologous region are substituted with Asp and Ile (Fig. 1 A).Figure 1Cofilin homology domain is important for N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization.

GST-VCA and GST-Δcof-VCA were incubated with Arp2/3 complex purified from bovine brain or actin purified from rabbit muscle and precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose. The bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Arp3 antibody or Coomassie staining. D,Δcof mutation reduces the activation activity of VCA region for Arp2/3-induced actin polymerization. Fluorescence intensity that reflects actin polymerization (2.2 μm actin and 60 nm Arp2/3 complex) was followed in the absence (●, actin only; ▪, actin and Arp2/3 complex) or presence of various amounts of GST-VCA (○, 100 nm; ■, 30 nm), and GST-Δcof-VCA (▵, 100 nm; ▿, 30 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The region deleted in Δcof mutant is reported to be included in the Arp2/3 complex binding region (28.Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined the possible effect of the Δcof mutation on the binding to Arp2/3 complex with GST fusion proteins of the VCA region of the wild-type N-WASP and Δcof (GST-VCA and GST-Δcof-VCA, respectively, Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the binding of Arp2/3 complex to GST-Δcof-VCA was markedly reduced compared with that to GST-VCA. However, this mutant still binds to actin as efficiently as GST-VCA. Next, we measured actin polymerization activity of GST-Δcof-VCA in vitro using Arp2/3 complex and pyrene-labeled actin. The speed of actin polymerization was very slow in the case of actin only or actin plus Arp2/3 complex (Fig.1 D). The presence of GST had no significant effect on it (data not shown). GST-VCA protein activated Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization markedly. In contrast, GST-Δcof-VCA was found to be a much weaker activator of the actin polymerization induced by Arp2/3 complex. These results indicate that VCA region except the deleted four amino acid residues still has a weak Arp2/3 binding and activating function. The PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line has been used extensively for studies of neurite outgrowth due to its ability to undergo differentiation to a neuron-like phenotype in response to NGF or others. To investigate the function of N-WASP in neurite outgrowth, we examined the effect of expression of mutant N-WASPs in PC12 cells. For ectopic-expression in PC12 cells, we also prepared expression plasmids that encode wild-type, Δcof mutant, H208D mutant, and H208D-Δcof double mutant N-WASP (Fig. 2 A). H208D mutant has been shown to lack the binding ability for Cdc42 and to be unable to induce filopodium formation (11.Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391 (96): 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). As a control, GFP-encoding expression plasmid was also prepared. First, to estimate the expression of these constructs, cell lysates from transfected PC12 cells were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-N-WASP antibody (Fig. 2 B). All recombinant N-WASP proteins were found to be expressed at similar levels. We next investigated the morphological changes of PC12 cells in both the presence and absence of NGF. Typical photoimages of cells are shown in Fig. 3. Cells transfected with GFP develop neurites in the presence but not in the absence of NGF. The GFP expression had no significant effect on neurite extension in PC12 cells (data not shown). In contrast, transient overexpression of H208D mutant, which cannot bind to Cdc42, strongly inhibits neurite extension induced by NGF and makes the cells round like unstimulated cells. The expression of Δcof mutant also suppresses the long neurite extension, but compared with H208D mutant-expressing cells, Δcof-expressing cells bear short processes in response to NGF, and thus, the expression of Δcof is not as effective as H208D in blocking the morphologic change induced by NGF. These differences may be explained by the data that GST-Δcof-VCA still has a weak Arp2/3 complex-activating function (Fig. 1, C and D). On the other hand, the expression of H208D-Δcof double mutant N-WASP does not inhibit neurite extension induced by NGF, suggesting that H208D-Δcof can bind neither Cdc42 nor Arp2/3 complex, and thus, Cdc42 signal is transmitted to Arp2/3 complex through endogenous N-WASP. Then proportions of neurite-bearing cells were calculated. Among GFP-transfected cells, the proportion of neurite-bearing cells was 50% in the presence of NGF (Fig. 4). However, only 21% of Δcof-expressing cells bore neurites even in the presence of NGF. These results indicate that Δcof, a cofilin homology domain mutant of N-WASP, significantly inhibits NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and acts in a dominant-negative manner in NGF signaling in PC12 cells, although the Δcof mutant still causes a weak activation on Arp2/3 complex in the in vitro assay. Thus, it is suggested that the full activity of N-WASP to activate the Arp2/3 complex is needed to induce neurite outgrowth. In contrast to the Δcof-expressing cells, the cells overexpressing wild-type N-WASP develop neurites in response to NGF (Fig. 3). The proportion of neurite-bearing cells in wild-type N-WASP-expressing cells was 53% in the presence of NGF. These results indicate that the expression of wild-type N-WASP in PC12 cells has no significant effect on neurite extension and that wild-type N-WASP expression alone is not sufficient to induce neurite extension in the absence of NGF. On the other hand, only 11% of H208D mutant-transfected cells showed neurite extension, indicating that Cdc42 is essential to this process. Interestingly, neurite extension by NGF was almost recovered to normal levels (48%) in H208D-Δcof double mutant-expressing cells. It is known that neurite extension of PC12 cells is also induced by several other stimulants, such as KCl-induced depolarization and cAMP (29.Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30.Gunning P.W. Landreth G.E. Bothwell M.A. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To examine whether N-WASP plays a critical role in neurite extension induced by stimulants other than NGF, the effects of the expression of N-WASP mutants on neurite extension induced by cAMP were investigated. After the transfection with either GFP, wild-type N-WASP, Δcof, H208D mutant, or H208d-Δcof double mutant, cells were stimulated with Bt2cAMP, an analogue of cAMP that can permeate the cell membrane. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of Δcof also results in an inhibition of neurite extension, whereas cells expressing wild-type N-WASP normally develop neurites. H208D mutant also strongly inhibits neurite extension. On the other hand, H208D-Δcof double mutant does not. The proportion of neurite-bearing cells is 58% among GFP-transfected cells, 22% among Δcof-expressing cells, and 59% among wild-type N-WASP-expressing cells (Fig. 4). On the other hand, it is 17% among H208D mutant-expressing cells and 49% among H208D-Δcof double mutant-expressing cells stimulated with Bt2cAMP. Thus, as the case of NGF stimulation, the expression of H208D mutant inhibits neurite outgrowth most severely, and Δcof mutant also inhibits it significantly in response to Bt2cAMP, whereas the expression of H208D-Δcof double mutant does not have a significant effect on the neurite extension. The results presented above suggest N-WASP to be a generally required component in neurite extension in PC12 cells. However, the PC12 cell line, which is routinely used as an experimental model of neural cells, does not have all the properties of neural cells. To investigate the role of N-WASP in neurite extension in more native conditions, we carried out experiments with rat hippocampal primary culture cells. Primary culture cells were prepared from rat hippocampi, and adenovirus-mediated gene transduction was done. To estimate N-WASP expression mediated by recombinant adenovirus, the virus-infected cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-N-WASP antibody. As shown in Fig.5 A, in cells infected with wild-type and Δcof N-WASP recombinant adenoviruses (m.o.i. 50), 15-fold or more N-WASP was detected than in the control cells infected with LacZ-expressing recombinant adenoviruses (m.o.i. 50). Under this condition, the Δcof expression inhibits neurite extension (Fig.5 B). In contrast, LacZ-expressing or wild-type N-WASP-expressing neural cells develop neurites. Thus, also in primary cultured neural cells, the expression of Δcof inhibits neurite outgrowth, whereas the expression of wild-type N-WASP does not. Proportions of neurite-bearing cells were also calculated in control, wild-type, and Δcof N-WASP-expressing cells (Fig. 5 C). Among LacZ-expressing control cells, 74% showed neurite extension. Wild-type N-WASP-expressing cells showed a similar percentage, 76%, but in Δcof N-WASP-expressing cells, the percentage was reduced to 29%. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that N-WASP is a crucial and general component in neurite extension. Furthermore, this phenomenon is probably caused through Cdc42-triggered N-WASP activation and the consequent activation of Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization. We thank Dr. J. Miyazaki (Osaka University Medical School) for donating CAG promotor for ectopic expression and Dr. I. Saito and Dr. Y.

To determine the levels of phospholamban which are associated with maximal inhibition of SERCA2, several lines of transgenic mice were generated which expressed increasing levels of a non-phosphorylatable form of phospholamban (S16A,T17A) specifically in the heart. This mutant form of phospholamban was chosen to prevent phosphorylation as a compensatory mechanism in vivo. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed increased phospholamban protein levels of 1.8-, 2.6-, 3.7-, and 4.7-fold in transgenic hearts compared with wild types. There were no changes in the expression levels of SERCA2, calsequestrin, calreticulin, and ryanodine receptor. Assessment of SR Ca2+ uptake in hearts of transgenic mice indicated increases in the inhibition of the affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+ with increased phospholamban expression. Maximal inhibition was obtained at phospholamban expression levels of 2.6-fold or higher. Transgenic hearts with functional saturation in phospholamban:SERCA2 (≥2.6:1) exhibited increases in β-myosin heavy chain expression, associated with cardiac hypertrophy. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable form of phospholamban in transgenic mouse hearts resulted in saturation of the functional phospholamban:SERCA2 ratio at 2.6:1 and suggest that approximately 40% of the SR Ca2+pumps are functionally regulated by phospholamban in vivo.

Phosphorylation at each of these sites is associated with stimulation of the initial rates of SR Ca2+transport, especially at low or diastolic Ca2+concentrations (7.Hicks M.J. Shigekawa M. Katz A.M. Circ. Res. 1979; 44: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9.Kranias E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 844: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11.Tada M. Inui M.

The stimulatory effects of PLB phosphorylation at these two sites can be reversed by a cardiac SR-associated type 1 protein phosphatase, which is also subject to cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of its inhibitor protein (18.Kranias E.G.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3859-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The apparent affinity of the SERCA2 for Ca2+ is not only regulated by the phosphorylation state of PLB, but is also modulated by changes in the PLB:SERCA2 ratio. Alterations in the stoichiometric ratio of PLB to SERCA2, associated with alterations in SR Ca2+ transport, have been implicated as important determinants of depressed left ventricular function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In hypothyroidism, increases in the PLB:SERCA2 ratio reflect decreases in the rates of SR Ca2+transport and relaxation; in hyperthyroidism, decreases in this ratio are associated with increases in the rates of SR Ca2+transport and relaxation (20.Kiss E. Jakab G. Kranias E.G. Edes I. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21.Kiss E. Brittsan A.G. Edes I. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In murine atrial muscle, the PLB:SERCA2 ratio is shown to be 4-fold lower than ventricular muscle, and this has been suggested to reflect the enhanced rates of contraction and relaxation in this muscle (22.Koss K.L. Ponniah S. Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice, either deficient in PLB or expressing reduced levels of PLB (PLB-heterozygous), exhibited increased rates of SR Ca2+transport and enhanced cardiac ventricular function compared with wild-type littermates (23.Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M. Haghighi K. Ferguson D.G. Slack J.P. Grupp G. Doetschman T. Solaro R.J. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A direct linear correlation was obtained between the relative levels of PLB:SERCA2 and the apparent affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+ as well as the rates of contraction and relaxation in isolated beating hearts or isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from wild-type, PLB-heterozygous, and PLB-deficient mice (23.Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M. Haghighi K. Ferguson D.G. Slack J.P. Grupp G. Doetschman T. Solaro R.J. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional stoichiometry of PLB:SERCA2 in cardiac muscle plays an important role in modulating myocardial contractility by regulating the rate of Ca2+ sequestration into the SR lumen.The molar stoichiometry of PLB:SERCA2 in native membranes of cardiac SR is presently unclear because different ratios of oligomeric and monomeric forms of PLB and SERCA2 have been reported in the literature. In vitro studies using 32P labeling of PLB and SERCA2 reported a 1:1 ratio of PLB to SERCA2, assuming that PLB (23 kDa) was a heterodimer and that the functional unit of SERCA2 was a dimer (existing in its phosphorylated (EP) and unphosphorylated (E) state) (11.Tada M.

The use of calmodulin affinity labeling of PLB suggested a ratio of one PLB monomer to one SERCA2 monomer (24.Louis C.F. Turnquist J. Jarvis B. Neurochem. Res. 1987; 12: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas the use of a monoclonal antibody to detect the PLB-phosphorylated intermediates indicated a relationship of 2 mol of PLB monomer to 1 mol of SERCA2 monomer (17.Colyer J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17486-17493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, in vivo studies showed that overexpression of wild-type PLB, either in the hearts of transgenic mice or adenoviral transfected cardiomyocytes, resulted in depressed SR and left ventricular function, suggesting that there is a fraction of Ca2+ pumps in the native SR which is not functionally regulated by PLB (25.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 26.Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Kang J.X. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there was a close linear correlation observed between the relative levels of PLB:SERCA2 and the EC50 values of SERCA2 for Ca2+ in PLB 2-fold overexpression, wild-type, PLB-heterozygous, and PLB-deficient hearts, indicating that in transgenic hearts the overexpressed PLB was functionally coupled to SERCA2. However, it was unclear from these results whether all of the spare, unregulated pumps in the SR were saturated by the overexpressed PLB. Thus, to determine the functional stoichiometric ratio of PLB to SERCA2, which is associated with maximal inhibition of the affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+, transgenic mice overexpressing a mutant form of PLB (S16A,T17A) were generated. The use of this mutant PLB, which cannot become phosphorylated, assured the lack of any compensation occurring at the level of PLB phosphorylation, to relieve its inhibitory effects in vivo. Assessment of SR Ca2+ uptake in the transgenic hearts revealed increased inhibition of the affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+ with increased expression of PLB. Saturation of the PLB:SERCA2 ratio was obtained at PLB expression levels greater than 2-fold. Furthermore, cardiac hypertrophy was observed in transgenic hearts whose PLB:SERCA2 stoichiometry reached saturation, suggesting a compensatory response to the inhibitory effects of PLB in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe ethics committee of the University of Cincinnati approved the handling and maintenance of the animals in this study. 10–12-week-old mice of either sex were used for the following studies.Site-directed MutagenesisThe PCR methodology by Bowmanet al. (27.Bowman S. Tischfield J.A. Stambrook P.J. Tech. J. Methods Cell. Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 254-260Google Scholar) was used to incorporate the site-specific mutation S16A,T17A (TCCACT → GCCGCT) into the PLB cDNA. A 0.85-kb SalI fragment containing the PLB cDNA and the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence (PLB cDNA-SV40-poly(A)) was released from the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (α-MHC)-PLB-SV40 fusion gene, used previously to generate transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type PLB (25.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 27.Bowman S. Tischfield J.A. Stambrook P.J. Tech. J. Methods Cell. Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 254-260Google Scholar). ThisSalI PLB cDNA-SV40-poly(A) fragment was then subcloned into a pBluescript SKII(−) vector (Stratagene), which has both T3 and T7 primer sites flanking the insert. PCR mutagenesis was performed by two consecutive PCR amplifications, using two different sets of primers, as described previously (28.Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the first PCR amplification, a 5′-end mutant primer (5′-CT ATC AGG AGA GCC GCCGCT ATT GAA ATG CC-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 32–62 of the PLB coding sequence, and a 3′-end T7 primer were used to generate the desired mutant PLB cDNA minor product. In the second PCR amplification, an aliquot of the first PCR product and the T3 and T7 primers was used to amplify the full-length insert, which contained the desired mutation in the PLB cDNA. The final product was cut with SalI, gel purified, and resubcloned into theSalI site of a second pBluescript SKII(−) vector, which was then transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells. Colonies from the transformed cells containing the desired mutant PLB cDNA were identified by DNA sequencing. The mutated PLB cDNA-SV40-poly(A) sequence was excised by SalI from the pBluescript SKII(−) vector and ligated into the SalI site of the 5.5-kb mouse α-MHC promoter, also contained in the pBluescript SKII(−) vector.Generation and Identification of Mutant MiceThe entire expression construct was contained in the pBluescript SKII(−) vector as an SpeI-KpnI fragment, which was composed of the cardiac-specific α-MHC promoter (5.5 kb), the PLB coding region with S16A,T17A (0.6 kb), and the SV40-poly(A) signal sequence (0.25 kb). The SpeI-KpnI fragment was released from the plasmid vector, gel purified, and used for pronuclear microinjection of fertilized eggs from FVB/N mice to generate transgenic mice according to standard procedures (29.Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Transgenic mice harboring the mutated PLB transgene were identified using PCR methodology and Southern analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies, as described previously (30.Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 31.Walter C.A. Nasr-Schirf D. Luna V.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1065-1070PubMed Google Scholar). The transgene expression, driven by the cardiac-specific α-MHC promoter, was determined by Northern analysis of total RNA from transgenic mouse hearts (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Two different lines of hemizygous transgenic mice overexpressing 1.8-fold and 1.9-fold mutant PLB were mated to generate transgenic offspring that would overexpress higher levels of mutant PLB. Transgenic offspring, expressing either one transgene or both transgenes from each parent, were identified by Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA obtained from tail biopsies. Briefly, genomic DNA was digested withBamHI and EcoRI overnight, separated by gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.32P-Labeled PLB cDNA was hybridized to the membrane, and the copy number of the transgene was determined relative to the endogenous PLB gene, using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant analysis system. Transgenic offspring exhibiting greater transgene levels than either of their transgenic parents were chosen to be studied. In these offspring, the transgene levels were similar from mating to mating.Western Blot AnalysisQuantitative immunoblotting of cardiac homogenates and microsomes enriched in SR membranes was carried out as described previously (33.Harrer J.M. Kiss E. Kranias E.G. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 995-998PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a pool of three to six hearts was prepared from either wild-type or transgenic mice and homogenized at 4 °C in buffer A, pH 7.0, containing (in mmol/liter) 10 imidazole, 300 sucrose, 1 dithiothreitol, 1 sodium metabisulfite, and 0.3 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These cardiac homogenates were used to assess the levels of PLB, SERCA2, calsequestrin, calreticulin, ryanodine receptor, β-myosin heavy chain, and α-actin in wild-type and transgenic mouse hearts. To determine if the overexpressed mutant form of PLB was inserted into the SR membrane, preparations of microsomes enriched in SR membrane were prepared by differential centrifugation of the cardiac homogenate. Homogenates were centrifuged at 8,000 × g (20 min), and the pellets were rehomogenized in buffer A and centrifuged as above. The supernatants from the two spins were combined, 4.0 m NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.6 m and centrifuged at 100,000 × g (60 min). The resulting pellet was washed in buffer A and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g (60 min). The final pellet was resuspended in buffer A and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations of homogenates and enriched microsomes were determined by the Bio-Rad method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The homogenates and microsomes were incubated with equal volumes of loading buffer (20% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 130 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 6.8). Cardiac homogenates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE (ryanodine and β-MHC) or 13% SDS-PAGE (PLB, SERCA2, calsequestrin, calreticulin, and α-actin) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.05 μm for PLB; 0.22 μm for SERCA2, calsequestrin, calreticulin, ryanodine receptor, β-MHC, and α-actin (Schleicher & Schuell)). The membranes were incubated with PLB (1:1,000 dilution), SERCA2 (1:500), calsequestrin (1:2,500), calreticulin (1:10,000), ryanodine receptor (1:500), β-MHC (1:2,500), and α-actin (1:2,000) antibodies and visualized with either 35S-labeled (2 × 105 cpm/ml) or peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The degree of labeling was determined using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software. For immunodetection of PLB phosphorylation sites, polyclonal antibodies raised against a PLB peptide (residues 9–199) phosphorylated at Ser16(PLB-phosphoserine 16) or at Thr17 (PLB-phosphothreonine 17) were used. The samples were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto 0.05-μm nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with PLB-phosphoserine 16 (1:10,000 dilution) and PLB-phosphothreonine 17 (1:5,000 dilution) antibodies and visualized with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The degree of labeling was determined using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software.SR Ca2+ Uptake AssayMouse hearts were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The frozen hearts were powdered and homogenized in 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mmNaF, 1 mm edta, 0.3 mm sucrose, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. The initial rates of Ca2+ uptake in whole-heart homogenates were obtained and calculated as described previously (34.Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar).In Vitro PhosphorylationCyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation was performed as described previously (28.Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in cardiac homogenates of wild-type and transgenic mice. In the non-radioactive phosphorylation experiments, 4.0 mm ATP was used in place of the 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP in the phosphorylation assay buffer.MaterialsGenerous gifts of materials included mouse α-MHC promoter from Dr. J. Robbins (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH), rabbit polyclonal anti-calsequestrin affinity-purified antibody from Dr. L. R. Jones (Indiana University, Indianapolis), and mouse monoclonal anti-β-MHC antibody from Dr. J. J. Leger (Pharmacie INSERM Unité, 300 LPM2, Montpellier, France). The SERCA2 polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbits using the 192–205 amino acid sequence portion of the SERCA2. The mouse anti-PLB and anti-ryanodine monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. The rabbit anti-calreticulin polyclonal antibody was obtained from Stressgen Biotech, Inc. The mouse anti-α-actin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The rabbit anti-PLB-phosphoserine 16 and phosphothreonine 17 antibodies were obtained from PhosphoProtein Research Inc.Data AnalysisData were plotted, and curve fits were obtained using KaleidaGraph by Abelbeck Software. The KaleidaGraph program uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for non-linear curve fitting. Data were weighted using the reciprocal of the weighting factor (ω) calculated from the equation ω = (S.E.)2, where S.E. is the standard error of the mean of replicate measures of the EC50 (n = 3–9).Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's ttest for unpaired observations. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.DISCUSSIONThis study presents the first in vivo evidence that maximal inhibition of the affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+ by PLB is obtained at PLB expression levels that are 2.6-fold or higher than those in wild-type hearts, indicating that the functional stoichiometry of PLB:SERCA2 is approximately 0.4:1 in vivo. The generation of transgenic models with cardiac-specific overexpression of various levels of a non-phosphorylatable form of PLB in its native phospholipid environment allowed us to examine the effects of alterations in PLB:SERCA2 ratio on SR function. Cardiac-specific overexpression of PLB harboring the S16A,T17A mutation was achieved using the α-MHC promoter, which is developmentally and hormonally regulated in vivo (25.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The mutation of S16A,T17A in PLB was chosen because recent studies in transgenic mice suggested that increased phosphorylation of PLB may constitute an important compensatory mechanism in the heart (39.Kim S.J. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Yamamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Wagner T.E. Shannon R.P. Kim Y.K. Takagi G. Asai K. Homcy C.J. Vatner S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Such increased PLB phosphorylation would attenuate the inhibitory effects of PLB overexpression on the affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+ and prevent estimates of PLB:SERCA2 ratios. Furthermore, previous studies showed that replacing Ser16 by Ala or Thr17 by Ala in PLB did not compromise its inhibitory effects in expression systems (35.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these amino acid substitutions did not alter the interaction between PLB and SERCA2. Quantitative immunoblots of cardiac homogenates and enriched SR preparations from transgenic mice revealed 1.8-, 2.6-, 3.7-, and 4.7-fold increases in PLB protein levels compared with wild-type littermates and confirmed that the SR membrane was capable of accommodating increased PLB levels. Thus, the PLB-overexpressing mice provided an attractive system for further elucidation of the PLB regulatory effects on SERCA2. Biochemical analysis of the SR Ca2+ transport system indicated that the EC50 of SERCA2 for Ca2+ was increased significantly by PLB overexpression. However, the maximal velocity of Ca2+ transport was similar in PLB-overexpressing and wild-type hearts. These findings together with our previous observations in PLB-heterozygous and PLB-deficient hearts (28.Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34.Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) show that PLB is not a modulator of the maximal velocity of the SERCA2 pump. When the relative levels of PLB in our mouse models with reduced or overexpressed PLB were plotted against the Ca2+ transport EC50 values, there was a close linear correlation up to 1.8-fold PLB overexpression. Maximal increases in EC50 were observed in hearts overexpressing PLB by 2.6-fold or higher, suggesting a “functional saturation” of SERCA2 by PLB. Extrapolation between the EC50 values and the PLB levels in the genetically engineered mouse models indicated that approximately 40% of the SR Ca2+ pumps are functionally regulated by PLB in native SR membranes.The functional stoichiometry of PLB:SERCA2 was shown previously to be a key regulator of cardiac contractile parameters in PLB-deficient, PLB-heterozygous, and PLB wild-type hearts (23.Luo W. Wolska B.M. Grupp I.L. Harrer J.M. Haghighi K. Ferguson D.G. Slack J.P. Grupp G. Doetschman T. Solaro R.J. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the relative ratio of PLB to SERCA2 was observed to remain constant throughout murine postnatal development (40.Harrer J.M. Haghighi K. Kim H.W. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H57-H66PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that strict regulation of the relative PLB and SERCA2 levels is critical for maintaining proper cardiac function. However, the functional stoichiometry of PLB:SERCA2 in native membranes has been reported to be less than 1:1 and up to 2:1 (11.Tada M. Inui M. Yamada M. Kadoma M. Kuzuya T. Abe H. Kakiuchi S. J.

Overexpression of PLB in transgenic hearts (25.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin.

Res. 1997; 81: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) revealed inhibition of the affinity of SERCA2 for Ca2+, suggesting that the PLB:SERCA2 stoichiometry is less than 1:1, and a fraction of the SR Ca2+ pumps is not regulated by PLB in the native SR (25.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 26.Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Kang J.X. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine the magnitude of this fraction of unregulated SR Ca2+ pumps in vivo, we generated a series of transgenic lines with increasing levels of PLB expression in the heart and assessed the degree of inhibition of SR Ca2+ transport rates by PLB. This two-prong approach allowed us to determine the level of PLB required to “saturate” inhibition of the SR Ca2+ pumps and assess indirectly the native stoichiometry of PLB:SERCA2.Several studies have reported previously that increases in the relative PLB:SERCA2 ratio may be associated with pathophysiological conditions. An increase in the PLB:SERCA2 ratio was observed in the hearts of hypothyroid rats and mice (1.82:1 and 1.93:1 PLB:SERCA2, respectively), and this alteration result"

Using PC12 cells engineered to stably express isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible Cox-2 (PCXII-4), we have investigated the putative effects of Cox-2 expression on differentiation, proliferation, and trophic withdrawal apoptosis. Cox-2 bioactivity had no effect on nerve growth factor-induced differentiation, epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation, or aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase expression. However, trophic withdrawal apoptosis, induced by the removal of nerve growth factor following differentiation, was markedly reduced in the PCXII-4 when compared with control cells, as assessed by annexin V staining, DNA laddering, and Hoechst 33258 staining. The specificity of this effect was confirmed using two pharmacologically distinct nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin and NS398. Investigations showed that the activity of the pro-apoptotic protease caspase-3 was reduced in PCXII cells. This study demonstrates that Cox-2-derived prostaglandins exert cytoprotective effects in trophic factor withdrawal apoptosis and provides evidence that this is, at least in part, due to suppression of caspase-3 activity.

Also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase, the enzyme is responsible for both the cyclooxygenase reaction in which arachidonate is converted to prostaglandin G2 and the peroxidase reaction in which this intermediate undergoes a bi-electron reduction to prostaglandin H2. Prostaglandins are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological responses. Two forms of the prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase have been identified, encoded by distinct genes but exhibiting structural and enzymatic similarities. Cox-1 is the “constitutive” isoform, whereas Cox-2 is the “inducible” form of the enzyme. Cox-2, normally absent from cells, is rapidly expressed in response to a wide variety of cytokines (2.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), growth factors (3.Ryseck R.P. Raynoschek C. Macdonald-Bravo H. Dorfman K. Mattei M. Bravo R.

Further, the constitutive expression of Cox-2 in colon carcinoma has been shown to represent a causal factor in the transformation of this tissue (8.Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H.

The cDNA encoding Cox-2 was originally described as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-inducible sequence 10 (9.Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Herschman H. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar), one of a number of primary response genes rapidly and transiently induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in Swiss 3T3 cells rendered quiescent by confluency. Early studies identified the expression of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-inducible sequence genes to be cell type-specific. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-inducible sequence 10/Cox-2 mRNA was notably absent from rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells stimulated with a range of growth factors and ion channel agonists (10.Arenander A.T. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Cole R. de Vellis J. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that this inability to express 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-inducible sequence 10 resulted from either a developmental “shut-down” of the gene or a mutation that rendered successful transcription impossible. We have generated PC12 cell lines stably expressing isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible Cox-2 (PCXII). Because PC12 cells are used as a cell culture model of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuronal differentiation and have facilitated studies into the signaling pathways leading to the differentiated phenotype (11.Qui M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), this cell line represents an ideal tool for investigations into the effects of Cox-2 overexpression on cellular differentiation. Further, PCXII cells also facilitate studies into the effect of Cox-2-derived prostaglandins on the trophic withdrawal apoptosis, which occurs upon NGF removal subsequent to differentiation. This cell culture model of programmed cell death has been used extensively to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the abnormal neuronal apoptosis characteristic of various neurodegenerative pathologies (12.Teng K.K. Green L.A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 218-224Crossref Google Scholar). Rat tail collagen I and 2.5s NGF were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products. Anti-2.5s NGF antibody and Hoechst 33258 were purchased from Sigma. All cell culture media, sera, geneticin (G-418), and IPTG were from Life Technologies, Inc. Hygromycin was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) antiserum was obtained from Biogenesis Inc (Sandown, NH). Genomic DNA isolation kits were from Qiagen. PC12 cell lines were routinely grown on rat tail collagen type I in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5%, calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A 2.1-kilobase SmaI-EcoRV fragment of Rat Cox-2 cDNA containing the open reading frame for the 604-amino acid polypeptide (a kind gift of R. N. DuBois, Nashville, TN; Ref.13.Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pRSVNOT plasmid of the LacSwitch gene expression system (Stratagene) in which its transcription is driven by a combination Rous sarcoma virus/bacterial β-galactosidase promoter. Having first isolated and characterized a PC12 clone stably expressing a Lac repressor protein designed to tonically suppress gene expression from the Rous sarcoma virus/bacterial β-galactosidase promoter promoter, the pRSVNOT/Cox-2 vector was transfected into this cell line; parallel transfections were also carried out using the pRSVNOT vector to generate control cell lines (PC-MT). Selection for clonal expression of both the Lac repressor protein and the Cox-2 construct (or pRSVNOT in the case of vector only transfected cells) was achieved by the addition of hygromycin (80 μg/ml) and geneticin (800 μg/ml), respectively. A number of clones that expressed Cox-2 following the addition of IPTG (2.5 mm) to the cell culture media were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using anti-Cox-2 antiserum (a kind gift of Dr. J. Maclouf, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France). Clones exhibiting IPTG-inducible expression of Cox-2 were assessed for PGE2production as described previously (14.Kaplan M.D. Olschowka J.A. O'Banion M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18534-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to approximately 80% confluency in 6-well culture dishes. The cells were washed once with DMEM, 0.3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated in DMEM, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, IPTG (2.5 mm) for 6 h, after which time arachidonic acid (30 μm) was added to all wells (30 min, 37 °C). At the end of the assay conditioned medium was removed, and the cells were lysed by addition of water, scraped, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The media and cell lysate supernatant from each individual well were combined and subjected to C18 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) extraction. PGE2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BioTrak, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, or PerSeptive Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (15.Bokemeyer D. Guglielmi K.E. McGinty A. Sorokin A. Lianos E.A. Dunn M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm orthovanadate. Samples standardized for protein (BCA; Pierce) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4 and 10% acrylamide for stacking and resolving gels, respectively. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the appropriate polyclonal antibody. For differentiation experiments PC12 cells were placed in 0.1% horse serum/calf serum containing 50 ng/ml NGF in the presence or absence of IPTG (2.5 mm) for 7–14 days, with the medium being changed every other day. In some experiments arachidonic acid (10−8m) was added daily to all cells. For mitogenesis experiments cells were plated in 96-well culture dishes at an initial seeding density of 1000 cells/well in DMEM, 0.1% horse serum/calf serum, containing 2.5 mm IPTG, in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 72 h. Cell proliferation was determined using a nonradioactive proliferation assay (CellTiter 96 AQueous, Promega) exactly according to the protocol provided. Using this method the quantity of a bioreduced formazan product (measured at 492 nm) is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. For studies into NGF withdrawal apoptosis, differentiation was carried out as described, after which time NGF was removed by washing twice in DMEM containing 0.1% horse serum/calf serum and replacing the differentiation medium with DMEM, 0.1% horse serum/calf serum, anti-2.5s NGF (1:400–1:500) in the presence or absence of IPTG (2.5 mm). For cell surface phosphatidyl serine localization experiments cells were cultured and differentiated on collagen-coated coverslips. 6 h following the addition of anti-2.5s NGF, phosphatidyl serine was visualized using an ApoAlert Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy following staining with annexin V-FITC. In parallel experiments DNA was extracted from control and Cox-2-expressing cells 10–18 h following induction of apoptosis and genomic DNA isolated. DNA laddering was analyzed by means of electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 1.8% agarose gel. In a separate series of experiments, following differentiation of PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells for 7–9 days on collagen-coated coverslips, staining with the DNA-specific fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (25 μg/ml) 17 h following the induction of apoptosis. Parallel experiments involved adding either indomethacin (10 μm) or NS398 (100 nm) to both PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells 24 h prior to the induction of apoptosis and carrying out apoptosis as described previously in the presence of either indomethacin or NS398. Apoptotic cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy and the percentage of apoptotic cells (as determined by the presence of characteristic morphology) scored. In a separate series of experiments PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells were differentiated for 8 days either in the continuous presence of IPTG as described previously or with IPTG being added only 12 h prior to the removal of NGF. All cell samples were stained with both annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's instructions and subjected to flow cytometric analysis by means of a Coulter ELITE cytofluorometer (Coulter Electronics, Ltd., Bedfordshire, UK). Low fluorescence detritus was gated out prior to analysis. In all instances propidium iodide-positive cells represented less than 3% of the cell population. Propidium iodide-positive cells were considered nonviable and excluded from analysis. All measurements were carried out under the same instrumental settings. Data are presented as histogram plots showing the change in mean channel fluorescence intensity of annexin V-FITC. PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells were NGF-differentiated for 7 days as described previously. IPTG (2.5 mm) was added 12 h prior to the removal of NGF; PC-MT and PCXII cells that were manipulated exactly as those subjected to NGF withdrawal but that continued to be cultured in NGF-containing media served as controls. In a separate series of experiments PGE2 (0.01 μm) was added together with IPTG to PC-MT cells. 6 h after the induction of apoptosis cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Following four freeze-thaw cycles, cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. Samples standardized for protein were assayed for caspase-3 activity using the fluorimetric CaspACE Assay System (Promega) exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the LacSwitch system, it was possible to generate stable cell lines in which Cox-2 expression was “switched on” following the addition of IPTG to the cell culture media. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-Cox-2 antibody was carried out on cell lysates of putative clones to confirm that expression of this enzyme was IPTG-inducible. From 16 clones analyzed, 5 were found to exhibit IPTG-inducible Cox-2, and clones 1 and 4, hereafter referred to as PCXII-1 and -4, were selected for further analysis. Because PCXII-1 and -4 were found to behave similarly with respect to differentiation, mitogenesis, and apoptosis, the results from the latter are presented here. Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A) confirmed that, as has been reported previously (10.Arenander A.T. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Cole R. de Vellis J. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Cox-2 is not endogenously expressed in these cells, whereas after addition of IPTG Cox-2 was abundantly expressed. The level of expression of Cox-2 was maximum after 17 h of IPTG treatment (Fig. 1 A). In PCXII lines Cox-2 expression persisted for up to 2 days following the addition of IPTG (Fig.1 B), and, upon removal of IPTG, induction ceased, and the level of Cox-2 expression decreased in 4 days (Fig. 1 B). The induction of Cox-2 expression in PCXII-4 cells was paralleled by elevated levels of PGE2 production as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1 C). Taken together these results confirm the IPTG inducibility and bioactivity of vector-encoded Cox-2. Although it has been reported that prostaglandin levels are elevated at very early time points post-NGF addition (16.DeGeorge J.J. Walenga R. Carboetto S. J. Neuroscience. Res. 1988; 21: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that Cox-1 behaves as an NGF-dependent delayed response gene in PC12 cells, localizing in both the cytoplasm and neurites (14.Kaplan M.D. Olschowka J.A. O'Banion M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18534-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indomethacin was found to have no observable effect on NGF-induced differentiation (16.DeGeorge J.J. Walenga R. Carboetto S. J. Neuroscience. Res. 1988; 21: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As can be seen NGF (50 ng/ml) treatment of PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells for 12 days led to the induction of the neuronal phenotype as exemplified by neurite extension (Fig.2, A and C). No effect on the phenotype of any of the PC12 cell lines was observed following the addition of IPTG alone (data not shown). The induction of Cox-2 expression did not alter the level of differentiation in PCXII-4 cells after 12 days of NGF treatment. In some experiments arachidonic acid (10−8m) was added during the time course of differentiation; however, this had no observable effect on the morphology of either PC-MT or PCXII-4 cells (data not shown). The temporal progression of neurite extension was similar in both control and Cox-2-expressing cells with short extensions being apparent after 3 days and elongation occurring throughout the time course of NGF addition. Further, although differentiated PCXII-4 cells extended shorter neurites than control cells this appeared to be a clonal effect because PCXII-1 cells were indistinguishable from PC-MT cells. No IPTG-inducible differences in neurite length between PC-MT cells and either PCXII cell line were apparent (Fig. 2, A and B versus C and D, and data not shown). These findings indicate that Cox-2 bioactivity neither facilitates nor interferes with the neurite extension. PC12 cells respond to different growth factors in distinct ways; whereas NGF and basic fibroblast growth factor induce the neuronal phenotype, EGF induces mitogenesis in these cells (11.Qui M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Cox-2 has been implicated in the proliferative response elicited by a number of growth factors including EGF (17.Angerman-Stewart J.A. Eling T.E. Glasgow W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18.Loftin C.D. Eling T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19.Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. Chinery R. Kirkland S.C. DuBois R.N. Jetton T.L. Morrow J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It has also been reported, however, that intestinal epithelial cells stably expressing Cox-2 exhibit a cellular phenotype (inhibition of cell proliferation) similar to parental cells following treatment with the growth inhibitory cytokine transforming growth factor-β (20.Sheng H. Shao J. Hooton E.B. Tsujii M DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 463-470PubMed Google Scholar), and, therefore, the influence of Cox-2 on cell growth exhibits a degree of cell type specificity. In view of these data, we next assessed the mitogenic responses of PC-MT and PCXII-4 cell lines following stimulation with EGF. As can be seen (Fig.3), EGF proved to be a potent mitogen for both cell lines; however, the induction of Cox-2 expression had no effect on the proliferative responses of PCXII-4 cells when compared with the control cell line. These results indicate that the growth stimulatory effects of EGF on PC-MT and PCXII-4 cell lines are similar and that the expression of IPTG-inducible Cox-2 neither negated nor enhanced these effects. It has been shown that the addition of exogenous PGE2 to PC12 cells leads to the induction of AADC, an enzyme directly involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitter molecules such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (21.Li X.-M. Juorio A.V. Boulton A.A. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Further, the observation that Cox-1 is localized both in the cytoplasm and neurites in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (14.Kaplan M.D. Olschowka J.A. O'Banion M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18534-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has increased speculation that Cox-derived prostanoids may somehow regulate AADC expression. In view of these findings, the levels of AADC in PCXII-4 versus control cells were investigated. Following NGF differentiation, PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells were lysed and subjected to Western analysis using a polyclonal antibody to AADC. As can be seen (Fig. 4), although the induction of Cox-2 in response to IPTG is clear, the levels of AADC protein remained unchanged between PCXII and PC-MT cell lines. These results indicate that the bioactivity of this Cox isoform at least does not appear to influence AADC protein expression. Following differentiation, removal of NGF from PC12 cells leads to cellular apoptosis (12.Teng K.K. Green L.A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 218-224Crossref Google Scholar). Apoptosis was observed within 6 h of NGF withdrawal in both cell lines in the absence of IPTG. However, in PCXII-4 cells a marked reduction in annexin V-FITC staining over control cells was apparent when prior NGF-induced differentiation was carried out in the presence of IPTG (data not shown). To confirm that exogenous Cox-2 expression did indeed confer PC12 cell resistance to NGF withdrawal apoptosis, late stage programmed cell death was evaluated by Hoechst 33258 staining. Evaluation of apoptosis following Hoechst 33258 staining (Fig. 5,A–D) indicated that cellular indications of programmed cell death, including chromatin condensation and nuclear segmentation, were significantly less in PCXII-4 cells differentiated and subjected to trophic factor withdrawal in the presence of IPTG (PC-MT 34%versus PCXII-4 5%; Fig. 5 E). The inclusion of either of two chemically distinct nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin, a broad specificity Cox inhibitor, or NS398, an isoform-specific Cox-2 blocker, for 24 h prior to, as well as during, NGF withdrawal apoptosis eliminated the IPTG-inducible cell protective effect (Fig. 5 E). Measurement of PGE2release from PCXII-4 cell during these experiments confirmed that these Cox inhibitors abolished IPTG-dependent increases in prostaglandin release (Fig. 5 F). The finding that the inclusion of either indomethacin or NS398 for 24 h prior to the induction of apoptosis was sufficient to abolish the protective effects of this enzyme provides evidence that Cox-2, rather than influencing the differentiation pathway of PC12 cells per se, appears to directly modulate the apoptotic process. To confirm this, PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells were differentiated for 8 days, either in the continuous presence of IPTG as previously or with the addition of IPTG 12 h prior to the induction of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis following annexin V-FITC staining (Fig. 6) indicated that induction of Cox-2 expression 12 h prior to the initiation of apoptosis was sufficient to confer cytoprotection comparable with that observed in PCXII-4 cells differentiated in the continuous presence of IPTG (PCXII-4+ IPTG, 8 days versus12 h, 3.1 versus 4.1% apoptotic cells; Fig. 6,C and D). Moreover, the addition of IPTG for 17 h was also found to be sufficient to attenuate DNA fragmentation in NGF-differentiated PCXII-4 cells (Fig.7). Together these findings support the contention that Cox-2 mediates its effects, not by altering the nonmorphological aspects of differentiation such as NGF-dependence but rather by negatively modulating the apoptotic process itself. The extent of laddering was markedly reduced in PCXII-4 cells differentiated in the presence of IPTG, when compared with PC-MT cells treated similarly (data not shown).Figure 6Effect of duration of Cox-2 expression on NGF withdrawal apoptosis. Cells were differentiated for 8 days, either in the continuous presence of 2.5 mm IPTG (PC-MT,A; PCXII-4, C) or with IPTG being added 12 h prior to the removal of NGF (PC-MT, B; PCXII-4,D). Following the induction of apoptosis, cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and subjected to flow cytometric analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Annexin V positive cells are represented by gate G (A, 32.6%; B, 31.3%;C, 4.1%; D, 3.1%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Induction of Cox-2 expression at the time of NGF withdrawal is sufficient to prevent apoptosis visualized by DNA laddering. Genomic DNA was isolated from PCXII-4 cells either before (lane 1) or 17 h after the induction of apoptosis in the presence (lane 2) or absence (lane 3) of IPTG, and DNA fragmentation was visualized by ethidium bromide staining following electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gel. Positions of 400- and 800-base pair (bp) markers are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because caspase-3-like proteases have been identified as effectors of NGF withdrawal apoptosis (22.Schulz J.B. Bremen D. Reed J.C. Lommatzsch J. Takayama S. Wullner U. Loschmann P.A. Klockgether T. Weller M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and in view of the observation that short-term Cox-2 expression and bioactivity was sufficient to curtail the death of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, the activity of caspase-3 in PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells was examined. Cells were differentiated for 7 days, and 12 h prior to the induction of apoptosis, IPTG was added to the culture media. PC-MT and PCXII cells that were manipulated exactly as those subjected to NGF withdrawal but that continued to be cultured in NGF-containing media served as controls. In a separate series of experiments PGE2 (0.01 μm) was added together with the IPTG to PC-MT cells. 6 h after the removal of NGF, control and apoptotic cells were lysed. Caspase-3 activity was assessed in cell lysates by means of a fluorimetric substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) cleavage assay; protease specificity was confirmed in parallel reactions incorporating the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO. As can be seen in Fig.8, caspase-3 activity levels were similar in control PC-MT and PCXII-4 cells, and this protease was activated in both cell lines following removal of NGF. However, PCXII-4 cells demonstrated consistently lower fold/basal increases in protease activity when compared with PC-MT cells (Fig. 8 and data not shown). When PC-MT cells were treated with PGE2 (0.01 μm) 12 h prior to the removal of NGF, the apoptosis-dependent fold increase in caspase-3 activity was reduced to levels similar to those found in Cox-2-expressing cells (Fig. 8). Taken together these data indicate that Cox-2 derived prostaglandins exert their cytoprotective effects, at least in part, via suppression of caspase-3 activity. The current study illustrates that a cell culture model of inducible Cox-2 expression enables the investigation of the physiological importance of this enzyme. The PCXII cell culture model permits the consequences of introducing Cox-2, a protein normally absent from PC12 cells, to be examined relatively easily. Expression of Cox-2 in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells was found to result in reduced trophic withdrawal apoptosis following removal of this growth factor. This effect was detected by three independent methods, annexin V staining, DNA laddering, and Hoechst 33258 staining, and was specifically dependent on Cox-2 bioactivity because it was only apparent in PCXII cells in the presence of transcriptionally permissive IPTG and was abolished by two pharmacologically distinct Cox inhibitors. Moreover, the cytoprotective actions of Cox-2 were demonstrated to involve the suppression of caspase-3 activity. The role of Cox-2 in the cell has been the focus of intense investigation since its discovery. The original hypothesis, that it existed merely to augment the bioactivity of Cox-1, has been expanded by the finding that Cox-2 expression is a causal factor in colon cancer (8.Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). Cell culture models of colon carcinoma have provided evidence that Cox-2 expression leads to enhanced metastatic potential (23.Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), stimulated endothelial motility, and tube formation via increased production of pro-angiogenic factors (24.Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N.

DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). The finding that the anti-apoptotic effects of Cox-2 in differentiated PC12 cells subjected to NGF withdrawal are mediated in part through inhibition of caspase-3 is interesting in view of increasing evidence that supports a role for this protease in neuronal apoptosis (25.Kuida K.

Caspase-3-deficient mice exhibit abnormal brain cell apoptosis during development, with the result that these animals are characterized phenotypically by ectopic masses of supernumerary cells (25.Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 28: 368-372Crossref Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that specifically recognized active caspase-3 (and not its inactive zymogen), Srinivasan and co-workers (26.Srinivasan A. Roth K.A. Sayers R.O. Schindler K.S. Wong A.M. Fritz L.C. Tomaselli K.J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1004-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) carried out elegant studies demonstrating that this enzyme was localized in the somata and neurites of apoptotic neurons in the developing murine nervous system. In vitro studies have provided evidence that caspase-3 is involved, in a stimulus-dependent manner, in certain apoptotic processes, notably chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (27.Woo M. Hakem R. Soegas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 15: 806-819Crossref Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Moreover, although apoptotic membrane changes including phosphatidyl serine exposure (as detected by annexin V staining) still occur in cells lacking caspase-3, they are manifest with delayed kinetics (27.Woo M. Hakem R. Soegas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 15: 806-819Crossref Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Significantly, our results indicate that PCXII cells undergoing NGF withdrawal apoptosis exhibit many of the alterations in programmed cell death characteristic of caspase-3-deficient cells. Similarly, DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation were attenuated in epithelial cells overexpressing Cox-2 following butyrate-induced apoptosis (13.Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). However, although caspase-3 is known to be activated in butyrate-induced apoptosis (28.Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Ruemmele F.M. Dionne S. Qureshi I. Sarma D.S. Levy E. Seidman E.G.

Commun. 1999; 260: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the activation status of this protease in Cox-2-overexpressing cells undergoing programmed cell death has not yet been reported. Whether the effects of Cox-2-derived prostaglandins on caspase-3 activity are direct or indirect is the focus of ongoing investigations in our laboratory. Although multiple stimuli lead to apoptosis and at least 14 human caspases have been described, it is worthy of note that pro-caspase-3 is almost ubiquitously expressed and activated during programmed cell death (31.Porter A.G. Janicke R.U. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 6: 99-104Crossref Scopus (2725) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 can be activated by caspase-9, a protease that itself can be activated by apoptosis protease-activating factor-1. Indeed, it has been reported that the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 exerts some of its effects by inhibiting apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 (32.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 33.Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 455-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, apoptotic resistance in epithelial cells overexpressing Cox-2 has been found to be paralleled by an increase in Bcl-2 protein levels (13.Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar); moreover, epithelial Bcl-2 overexpression has been found to suppress butyrate-induced caspase-3 activation (30.Mandal M. Adam L. Kumar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Studies that have indicated that caspase-3 can be activated in a caspase-9-independent manner (34.Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D.

In conclusion, the current study has identified suppression of caspase-3 activity as a mechanism underlying the cytoprotective effects of Cox-2 expression in trophic withdrawal apoptosis. Because caspase-3 is a key effector in many diverse models of apoptosis, this finding is particularly significant, and studies are currently being undertaken to elucidate how Cox-2 mediates its inhibition of this protease."
https://openalex.org/W2055503849,"To investigate the organization of Golgi glycosyltransferases and their mechanism of localization, we have compared the properties of a number of medial and late acting Golgi enzymes. The medial Golgi enzymes,N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and II (GnTI and GnTII) required high salt for solubilization and migrated as high molecular weight complexes on sucrose density gradients. In contrast, the late acting Golgi enzymes, β1,4-galactosyltransferase and α1,2-fucosyltransferase, were readily solubilized in low salt and migrated as monomers/dimers by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Analysis of membrane-bound GnTI chimeras indicates that the formation of high molecular weight complexes does not require the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail sequences of GnTI. Furthermore, a soluble form of GnTI, containing the stem region and catalytic domain, accumulated in the Golgi prior to secretion, in contrast to β1,4-galactosyltransferase. Soluble GnTI, which also associated with high molecular weight complexes, was comparable with membrane-bound GnTI in its ability to glycosylate newly synthesized glycoproteinsin vivo. Mutation of charged residues within the stem region of GnTI, known to be important for “kin recognition”, had no effect on the efficiency of Golgi localization, the inclusion into high molecular weight complexes, nor functional activity in vivo. The differences in behavior between the medialand late acting Golgi enzymes may contribute to their differential localization and their ability to glycosylate efficiently in the correct Golgi subcompartment.

The Golgi is central to the secretory pathway, since it plays important roles in the maturation and sorting of newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins and also in the recycling of proteins and lipids to the endoplasmic reticulum (1.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 2.Farquhar M. Hauri H.-P. Berger E.G. Roth J. The Golgi Apparatus. Birhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 63-129Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the Golgi has a fundamental role in the biosynthesis of the glycan chains of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids in eukaryotic cells. Glycosylation occurs in a highly regulated manner as the newly synthesized molecules move from the cis to thetrans side of the Golgi stack (3.Varki A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 34-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The synthesis of carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates in mammalian cells is likely to require more than 200 different glycosyltransferase enzymes distributed throughout the Golgi stack (4.van den Eijnden D. Joziasse D.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 711-721Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5.Schachter H. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 88-162Google Scholar, 6.Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To understand the control of glycan biosynthesis in vivo requires an appreciation of the organization of glycosyltransferases within the membranes of the individual compartments. All Golgi glycosyltransferases cloned to date are Nin/Cout (type II) membrane proteins containing a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, and a large carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain situated in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (4.van den Eijnden D. Joziasse D.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 711-721Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5.Schachter H. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 88-162Google Scholar, 6.Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is linked to the transmembrane domain by a loosely defined “stem” region that may play a role in positioning the catalytic domain away from the lipid bilayer, facilitating access to the substrates. A number of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of complex N-glycans have been precisely localized and show distinct but overlapping distributions that are consistent with their order in the glycoprotein biosynthetic pathway (7.Rabouille C. Hui N. Hunte F. Kieckbusch R. Berger E.G. Warren G. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that determine the steady state distribution of Golgi glycosyltransferases are not well understood. Analysis of glycosyltransferase chimeras from transfected eukaryotic cells has demonstrated that the transmembrane domain of glycosyltransferases plays a critical role in Golgi localization; in addition, in a number of cases contributions from the luminal domain and cytoplasmic tail have also been detected, suggesting that there may be multiple signals involved in the specific localization of these Golgi enzymes (for reviews, see Refs. 8.Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar and 9.Gleeson P.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although these studies have been informative, in most cases it remains unclear whether the Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases chimeras are targeted correctly so that they can function appropriately in vivo. A number of models for the Golgi retention of glycosyltransferases have been proposed including oligomerization, lipid-mediated sorting, and intra-Golgi retrograde transport (10.Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 11.Füllekrug J. Nilsson T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These models are not mutually exclusive, although they need to be considered in the light of the current evidence for cisternal maturation (12.Bonfanti L. Mironov Jr., A.A. Martinez-Menarguez J.A.

Pelham H.R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 9-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the ability of green fluorescent protein (GFP)1-tagged resident Golgi glycosyltransferases to diffuse rapidly and freely in Golgi membranes (14.Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which indicates that Golgi targeting and retention is unlikely to depend on protein immobilization. The basis for the distribution of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi is clearly complex. Further information is required concerning the organization of Golgi glycosyltransferases within Golgi membranes and the properties that may distinguish glycosyltransferases found in different Golgi compartments. Glycosyltransferases may form large hetero-oligomeric structures (15.Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16.Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); however, it is not known if this is a property common to glycosyltransferases found in all regions of the Golgi. In the present study, we have compared the behavior of twomedial Golgi enzymes with two late-acting Golgi enzymes and demonstrate that the medial Golgi enzymes exist as large molecular weight complexes, in contrast to late-acting Golgi enzymes that are present as monomers and dimers. We have shown that inclusion of the medial Golgi enzyme,N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI), in high molecular weight complexes does not require the transmembrane domain of GnTI but rather is dependent on the luminal domain. Indeed, a soluble form of GnTI was retarded in the Golgi prior to secretion and was able to glycosylate newly synthesized glycoproteins efficiently in vivo. We propose that the inclusion of GnTI into high molecular weight complexes defines the location of the soluble construct and is critical for its ability to coordinate the synthesis of complexN-glycans. Cells were maintained at 37 °C as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 40 μg/ml proline, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1% (w/v) streptomycin. Transfected cells were maintained in the above medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-(bovine Gal-T1) antibodies were produced as described (17.Teasdale R.D. D'Agostaro G. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4084-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). myc epitope-tagged proteins were detected with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (18.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Anti-GFP monoclonal antibody was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Unless stated otherwise, 50 μl of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) contained 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2 0.01% gelatin, a 0.05 mm concentration of each of the four nucleotide triphosphates, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies), 0.016 units of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and 10 pmol of each primer. All cloned PCR products were verified by automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems). The constructs (see Fig. 1) were generated as follows. A full-length GnTI cDNA was amplified by PCR from human GnTI genomic DNA (19.Hull E. Sarkar M. Spruijt M.P.N. Höppener J.W.M. Dunn R. Schachter H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with primers incorporating a c-myc epitope (18.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). The sense primer (5′-CCGAATTCAGGATGCTGAAGAAGCAG-3′) included a EcoRI restriction site, and the antisense primer (5′-CTCGGATCCTTACAGGTCTTCTTCAGAGATCAGTTTCTGTTCCGGATTCCAGCTAGGATCATAGCC-3′) included a BamHI restriction site and the c-myc epitope (underlined). The 1391-bp PCR product was cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene), and the EcoRI/XbaI fragment of this construct was cloned into EcoRI/XbaI-digested pCI-neo (Promega). Full-length GnTII cDNA was amplified by PCR from human GnTII genomic DNA (20.Tan J. D'Agostaro G.A.F. Bendiak B. Reck F. Sarkar M. Squire J.A. Leong P. Schachter H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the sense primer 5′-TCTGAATTCACCATGAGGTTCCGCATCTACAA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTCGGATCCTCACAGGTCTTCTTCAGAGATCAGTTTCTGTTCCGGCTGCAGTCTTCTATAACTTTT-3′ (c-myc epitope underlined). The resulting 1398-bp PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pBluescript KS+, and the EcoRI/XbaI fragment of this construct cloned into EcoRI/XbaI-digested pCI-neo (Promega). A full-length HT cDNA was amplified by PCR from human HT cDNA (21.Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6674-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) using the sense primer 5′-CCGGAATTCACCATGTGGCTCCGGAGCCAT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CGCGAATCCTTACAGGTCTTCTTCAGAGATCAGTTTCTGTTCAGGCTTAGCCAATGTCCAGAG-3′ (c-myc epitope underlined). The resulting 1149-bp PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pBluescript KS+, and the EcoRI/XbaI fragment from this plasmid was cloned into EcoRI/XbaI-digested pCI-neo (Promega). The TfR/GnTI hybrid, TTG, was excised from pSVTgpt-TTG (22.Burke J. Pettitt J.M. Humphris D. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12049-12059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with EcoRI and cloned intoEcoRI-digested pCI-neo. A fragment, encoding the luminal domain of the chimera, was excised from this vector usingAflIII and SmaI, and a 1296-bp PCR fragment encoding the myc-tagged GnTI luminal domain was inserted in its place. The latter fragment was generated by PCR amplification of human GnTI genomic DNA using the GnTImyc antisense primer described above and the sense primer 5′-CCCACACGTCCAGCACCTGGCAGGCCA-3′, which incorporates an AflIII site (underlined) by conservative substitutions. Three substitutions (Asp77 → Asn, Arg83 → Ser, Arg85 → Ser) were incorporated into TfR/GnTImyc using a megaprimer mutagenesis protocol adapted from that of Ke and Madison (23.Ke S. Madison E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3371-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primer, 5′-GGCGGGAGGGGCCGCAGTGGGCACGCTCCCCG ACTGGCTCGACAGGGCATTCCCGATCTGCTG-3′ is based on the sequence of human GnTI but incorporates the mutations encoding the three amino acid substitutions (underlined) and also eliminates a SacII site by conservative substitution. The flanking sense primer was based on the signal/anchor sequence of the human transferrin receptor (TfR) (5′-CCGAATTCACCATGGTC-3′), and the antisense flanking primer was the 3′ GnTImyc primer described above. The PCR was initiated asymetrically, with 10 pmol of mutagenic primer and an annealing temperature of 55 °C. After five rounds of synthesis, 100 pmol of the sense flanking primer was added, and amplification continued for 25 cycles. Additional Taq and dNTPs were then added, and the annealing temperature increased to 72 °C (at this temperature, the sense primer cannot bind to the template, and so the previous PCR product acts as the sense primer). After five rounds of synthesis at this temperature, 100 pmol of antisense flanking primer was added, and the PCR continued for 25 cycles. The PCR product was cloned intoEcoRI/BamHI sites of pBluescript KS+, and then a 637-bp fragment was excised with EcoRI andSacII and cloned intoEcoRI/SacII-digested pCIneo-TfR/GnTImyc. A chimera was constructed in which GFP was fused to the carboxyl terminus of the TfR transmembrane domain and truncated cytoplasmic tail. A fragment encoding the TfR transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail was generated by PCR amplification of TfR/GnTI using the sense and antisense primers 5′-CCGAATTCACCATGGTC-3′ and 5′-CACTGGACGTGTACAATAGCCCAAGTAGC-3′, respectively. The 128-bp PCR product was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which had been linearized by digestion with NheI, and the 3′ recessed ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. A truncated GnTImyc cDNA, lacking the first 44 amino acids of GnTI, was amplified by PCR from human GnTI genomic DNA using the sense primer 5′-GCCAGCCTCACCCGGGAA-3′ and the antisense primer used for full-length GnTImyc as above. The resulting 1239-bp fragment was then blunt end-ligated into the SmaI site of pSHT (24.Madison E.L. Bird P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which positions the GnTI luminal sequence immediately 3′ of the hemagglutinin signal peptide sequence. A similar approach was used to construct mutated NSS-sGnTImyc using NSS-TfR/GnTImyc cDNA as template. Gal-T1 constructs in pSVTgpt and pSHT were as described (17.Teasdale R.D. D'Agostaro G. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4084-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO or CHO Lec1 cells (25.Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) or Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Constructs in pSVTgpt or pSHT were co-transfected with pCI-neo. Constructs in pCI-neo were transfected alone. Cells were selected in 800 μg/ml G418 and screened by indirect immunofluorescence. Clonal cell lines were obtained from the transfected populations by limiting dilution. Cells grown on 12-well glass microscope slides were rinsed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and free aldehyde groups were quenched in PBS, 50 mm NH4Cl. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 4 min and then rinsed three times in PBS. Monolayers were incubated in primary antibodies as described (26.Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Erlich R. Toh B.H. Gleeson P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and bound antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images were acquired using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal imaging system. Cells were harvested by scraping in PBS and then lysed in MNT (50 mm MES (pH 6.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, Complete® protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0–250 mm NaCl for 1 h on ice, and the extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 ×g. The supernatant was then further centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The low and high speed pellets and the final supernatant were made to the same volume in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. Clonal CHO Lec1 cells transfected with GnTImyc were harvested by scraping in Tris-buffered saline and extracted in MNT containing between 50 and 250 mm NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C. Extracts were either left on ice or centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. GnTI activity was assayed as described by Vischer and Hughes (27.Vischer P. Hughes R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using 200 μg of extract protein in 100-μl reactions, with ovalbumin as acceptor. GnTII was assayed as described (28.Bendiak B. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5775-5783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the synthetic acceptor Manα1–6[GlcNAcβ1,2Manα1–3]Manβ-octyl (29.Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Subconfluent monolayers were harvested using PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. Cells were washed in PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.02% NaN3 (PBS/FCS/NaN3) and incubated with 10 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated L-PHA (Sigma), in PBS/FCS/NaN3 for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in PBS/FCS/NaN3 and analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Cells were harvested by scraping in PBS, extracted in MNT containing either 100 or 250 mm NaCl for 1 h on ice, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was then layered on top of a 5–20% sucrose gradient containing MNT with 100 or 250 mm NaCl. Gradients were centifuged for 12 h at 125,000 × g maxin a SW55 rotor. Fractions (8.Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), each 630 μl, were collected from the bottom of the gradient. Proteins were precipitated from 150-μl aliquots of each fraction with methanol/chloroform as described by Wessel and Fleuge (30.Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), and pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The pellet from the ultracentrifuge tube was resuspended in a comparative volume. Samples were boiled for 5 min and then separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting as described below. For analysis of secreted GnTI, subconfluent monolayers of CHO Lec1 cells expressing sGnTImyc were incubated for 9 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following incubation, the culture medium was collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 ×g to remove cellular debris. An aliquot (600 μl) of supernatant was layered on a 5–20% sucrose gradient containing 50 mm MES (pH 6.5), 1% Triton X-100, and 100 mmNaCl. The gradient was centrifuged and analyzed as above. Triton X-114 extraction was performed as described by Bordier (31.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were extracted in 0.5% Triton X-114 containing 250 mm NaCl and Complete® protease inhibitors for 45 min on ice, and the extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Bromphenol blue (0.05% (w/v)) was added to the supernatant, and the sample was incubated for 3 min at 37 °C and centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 × g to separate aqueous and detergent phases. The volumes of the two phases were made equal with PBS, and the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were radiolabeled withl-[35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN) as described (32.Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and extracted in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1% Triton X-100 containing 100 mm NaCl and Complete® protease inhibitors for 45 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min, and supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of purified monoclonal antibody 9E10 for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were collected by the incubation with Protein G-Sepharose, and the Sepharose beads were washed as described (22.Burke J. Pettitt J.M. Humphris D. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12049-12059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described (32.Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-tagged proteins were detected with 9E10 hybridoma supernatant and Gal-T1 with affinity-purified anti-Gal-T1 antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont) as described (17.Teasdale R.D. D'Agostaro G. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4084-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More information about the characteristics that may distinguish glycosyltransferases that reside in different Golgi regions is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that regulate glycan biosynthesis and the differential localization of glycosyltransferases throughout the Golgi stack. Therefore, we have compared the physical states ofmedial Golgi and late Golgi glycosyltransferases. The enzymes examined include the two medial Golgi glycosyltransferases, GnTI and GnTII (33.Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar, 34.Schachter H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which are responsible for initiating the first two complex antennae of N-glycans, and two late acting Golgi enzymes, namely β1,4-galactosyltransferase (Gal-T1) and α1,2-fucosyltransferase (HT). Gal-T1 is atrans/trans-Golgi network-localized enzyme responsible for synthesis of the N-acetyllactosamine of complex N-glycans (35.Strous G.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 21: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36.Nilsson T. Pypaert M. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Berger E.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and HT is responsible for the synthesis of blood group H determinant (21.Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6674-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 37.Ernst L.K. Rajan V.P. Larsen R.D. Ruff M.M. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3436-3447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of bovine Gal-T1 in transfected cells, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was used (17.Teasdale R.D. D'Agostaro G. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4084-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To be able to detect GnTI, GnTII, and HT in transfected cells, we have tagged these three glycosyltransferases with a myc epitope at the C terminus. All three myc-tagged enzymes were shown to be active in transfected cells (data not shown); therefore, the addition of the myc epitope does not appear to perturb the folding of these enzymes. Stable transfected CHO cell clones expressing each of the four glycosyltransferases were obtained. For GnTI constructs throughout this study, CHO Lec1 cells were transfected, since this Lec mutant is devoid of GnTI activity (25.Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38.Stanley P. Annu. Rev.

Staining of GnTI-, GnTII-, or HT-transfected cells with the myc-specific monoclonal antibody, 9E10, showed in each case a perinuclear staining pattern, characteristic of the Golgi apparatus (Fig.2). In each case, the staining pattern remained unchanged after a 4-h treatment with cycloheximide. Furthermore, treatment of transfected cells with brefeldin A resulted in a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern typical of the ER (not shown). Together, these results confirm that these three myc-tagged enzymes are actively retained in the Golgi apparatus. Staining of bovine Gal-T1 transfected CHO cells with affinity-purified anti-bovine Gal-T1 antibodies also showed a perinuclear staining pattern similar to the other enzymes (Fig. 2). To determine if glycosyltransferases may be associated with complexes in Golgi membranes of mammalian cells, Triton X-100 extracts containing a range of NaCl concentrations were analyzed by immunoblotting. Extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g to remove any insoluble material, and then the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g to determine if high molecular weight complexes were present. After extraction in 50 mm NaCl/Triton X-100, the majority of myc-tagged GnTI protein was found in the insoluble pellet of a low speed centrifugation (15,000 × g) (Fig.3 A). The minor fraction of GnTI found in the supernatant of a low speed centrifugation was pelleted at high speed (100,000 × g), indicating that this soluble protein existed as a high molecular weight complex. Myc-tagged GnTI was detected as two components by immunoblotting with molecular masses of 49.5 and 53 kDa. This heterogeneity is due to glycosylation, since human GnTI has previously been shown to beO-glycosylated (39.Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25057-25063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and treatment of cell extracts with neuraminidase prior to immunoblotting resulted in collapse of the higher molecular weight to a similar size as the lower species (not shown). Extraction of myc-tagged GnTI-transfected CHO Lec1 cells with Triton X-100 containing 100 mm NaCl resulted in greater than 50% of GnTI protein remaining in the supernatant after a 15,000 × g centrifugation. At this salt concentration, approximately equivalent amounts of GnTI were found in the low speed pellet, the high speed pellet, and in the final supernatant. The amount of material remaining in the 100,000 × g supernatant increased with increasing salt concentration, and at 250 mmNaCl the majority of GnTI protein was detected in the 100,000 ×g supernatant (Fig. 3 A).

It is possible that the pelleted material in the low salt extractions represented aggregated inactive enzyme. To investigate whether thi"

More than 80% of the TG repair was accomplished by the single-nucleotide repair mechanism, and the remaining TGs were removed by the long patch BER pathway.

Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The damage to the thymine residue is of special interest, because thymine is the most easily oxidized base (2.Palecek E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Among the products of thymine oxidation, thymine glycol (TG)1 has drawn the greatest interest because of its profound biological effect. An increased level of thymine glycol has been observed in DNA after treatment of cells with UV irradiation, γ irradiation, or chemical mutagens known to generate oxygen radicals (3.Dizdaroglu M. Mutat. Res. 1992; 275: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). TG constitutes a strong block for DNA replication, and therefore it must be efficiently removed from DNA to maintain genome integrity (4.Ide H. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8035-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5.Clark J.M. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways are the two excision repair systems that may contribute to processing of TG in DNA. The BER pathway operates by removing either 1 or 2–6 nucleotides 3′ to a damaged base (6.Lindahl T. Karran P. Wood R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In contrast, NER incises DNA on each side of the lesion, and the damaged base is released as a part of a 25–30-base-long oligonucleotide (7.Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Previous studies in bacterial cells have suggested that BER is the major pathway for the removal of TG from DNA (8.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). In bacterial cells, TG is recognized and removed by endonuclease III (Nth protein) that subsequently cleaves the phosphodiester bond 3′ to the lesion (9.Breimer L.H. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5543-5548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endonuclease IV, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase complete the DNA repair process by removing a 3′ deoxyribose, filling the created one nucleotide gap, and ligating the DNA ends. Recently, human thymine glycol-DNA glycosylase (hNTH) has been cloned and purified by several groups (10.Aspinwall R. Rothwell D.G. Roldan-Arjona T. Anselmino C. Ward C.J. Cheadle J.P. Sampson J.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), thus providing enzymatic basis for the expected role of BER in removal of this lesion in mammalian cells. However, there is some evidence in both bacterial and mammalian cells suggesting the involvement of other DNA repair systems in the processing of TG in DNA. First, TG induces a significant, localized structural change to the DNA double helix that may be recognized by NER (13.Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9227-9236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Second, in vitro studies have shown that both bacterial and human NER enzymes recognize TG in DNA and excise it as a part of 25–30-base-long oligonucleotide (14.Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 235: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15.Lin J.J. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16.Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently demonstrated that general genome repair and transcription-coupled repair of TG is reduced in xeroderma pigmentosum group G/CS cell lines defective in the 3′ excision endonuclease (XPG protein), which participates in NER (17.Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This result suggests that XPG-dependent transcription-coupled repair may also play a role in TG repair. Thus, the role of different repair pathways in removal of TG in DNA by human cells remains unclear. In the present study we have employed an in vitro repair system that is optimal for both BER and NER. We examined the relative roles of NER and BER and the effect of XPG mutation in the repair of TG and find that single nucleotide patch base excision repair is the major pathway for removal of thymine glycol from DNA in human cell extracts. Human lymphoid cells AG9387 (apparently normal) and XP-G/CS primary fibroblasts GM13370 and GM13371 were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). Cells were grown in the medium recommended by Coriell. All oligonucleotides used were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX). Oligonucleotides were gel purified on a 20% polyacrylamide gel, 5′-end 32P-labeled, and annealed to the complementary strand as described previously (30.Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To generate an oligonucleotide duplex containing a single TG lesion, 2 μg of 5′-end32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing unique thymine residue (5′-pAGAGAGAAAGTACAAAGAGAGAGGG-3′) was incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm osmium tetroxide containing 2% pyridine for 30 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotide was purified from the reaction mixture by gel filtration on a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and subsequently annealed with the complementary strand. Whole cell extracts were prepared by the method of Manley et al. (18.Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Incision reactions (15 μl) contained 0.5 nmol of oligonucleotide duplex, 45 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and the indicated amount of extract protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 15 μl of formamide dye (0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue dissolved in 100% formamide), incubated for 5 min at 90 °C, and separated by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea, 89 mm Tris-Borate, pH 8.0, and 2 mmEDTA. The synthetic DNA duplex corresponding to the sequence 5′-TCTCTCTTTGTACTTTCTCT-3′ was cloned into theSmaI-XbaI site of M13mp18 DNA. The recombinant single-stranded DNA, named M13TG, was purified, and the insert orientation was verified by sequencing. To prepare the single TG-containing construct, the oligonucleotide 5′-pAGAGAGAAAGTACAAAGAGAGAGGG-3′ was treated with osmium tetroxide as described above, purified by gel filtration through G-25 spin column, and used to prime single-stranded M13TG DNA as described (19.Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A control construct was prepared using untreated oligonucleotide as a primer. The presence of TG was verified by sensitivity of single-lesion DNA to bacterial Endo III protein. The Endo III reaction was performed in a buffer containing 70 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml of carrier single-stranded oligonucleotide for 1 h at 37 °C. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 3–5 g of cells by the method of Manley et al.(18.Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Standard 50-μl repair reactions contained 50–200 ng of single TG-containing DNA, 45 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 40 mm phosphocreatine (di-Tris salt, Sigma), 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase (type I, Sigma), 3.4% glycerol (Fluka), 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 20 μmeach of three deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 2 μCi of α-32P-labeled deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) adjusted to 2 μmwith the corresponding cold deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, and 100 μg of a whole cell extract protein. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h. After the reaction, DNA was purified from the reaction mixture by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was treated with 20 units of the indicated restriction endonuclease for 3 h at 37 °C in the appropriate buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Reactions were stopped by addition of equal volume of formamide dye. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 90 °C and separated by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 89 mm Tris-Borate, pH 8.0, and 2 mm EDTA. The amount of radioactivity was quantified using PhosphorImager analysis provided by Molecular Dynamics. Osmium tetroxide reacts primarily with thymines and reacts more slowly with cytosine and guanine (20.Dizdaroglu M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 225-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 21.Klysik J. Rippe K. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9831-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Detection of the reaction products can be accomplished by piperidine cleavage of the phosphodiester bond adjacent to the modified base (2.Palecek E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We analyzed alkaline-sensitive sites generated in the single thymine containing oligonucleotide (Fig.1 A) treated with osmium tetroxide and found that, under our conditions, only one damaged site (that corresponds to the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bond next to thymine) was detected after a 30-min reaction (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, when the osmium tetroxide-treated oligonucleotide was annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide and incubated with human whole cell extract, there was only one major site of cleavage, corresponding to the modified thymine residue (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that TG is the major product of osmium tetroxide modification and that this damage is recognized and excised by human cell extracts. The TG-containing oligonucleotide was used in the construction of M13 double-stranded DNA. The constructed closed circular 7280-bp DNA contained a unique TG lesion and harbored restriction sites suitable for the analysis of repair patch size (Figs.2 A and3 A). To confirm the presence of the lesion in the substrate DNA, we demonstrated that this DNA is sensitive to Endo III, the bacterial enzyme that recognizes and removes TG in DNA (22.Demple B. Linn S. Nature. 1980; 287: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and cleaves of the phosphodiester bonds adjacent to the lesion (1.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The substrate DNA containing TG was first digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII. This cleavage generates two fragments: a 62-mer containing the lesion and a 7218-bp fragment representing the rest of the DNA. The fragments were then 3′-end labeled with Klenow fragment of Escherichia coliDNA polymerase I. Filling of the protruding 3′ end of the 62-mer fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and dTTP generated a 66-bp duplex DNA fragment labeled in the TG-containing strand. The labeled DNA was then treated with Endo IV (Fig.2 B, lane 2) or Endo III proteins (Fig.2 B, lane 3). Cleavage of the 66-mer at the site of TG would be expected to generate a 29-mer labeled fragment (Fig.2 A). The result of the described experiment is shown in the Fig. 2 B. There are no Endo IV-sensitive sites in the 66-mer fragment, and the expected 29-mer product is observed only in the TG-containing fragment after treatment with Endo III. These data indicate that the M13TG DNA contains a single TG at the defined position and is not contaminated with abasic sites in this region.Figure 3Restriction analysis of repair incorporation into control and TG-containing substrate DNA incubated with human whole cell extract.

Wallace S.S. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 235: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15.Lin J.J. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16.Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To address the relative contribution of BER and NER in the repair of TG in DNA, we determined repair patch characteristics on our specifically designed single TG-containing DNA substrate (Figs.2 A and 3 A). During base excision repair the hNTH protein removes TG from DNA, and the apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity of the same protein or a separate apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease incises the phosphodiester bond next to the apurinic/apyrimidinic site. The subsequent DNA repair events result in the replacement of one or more nucleotides in the 15-merCsp6I-Csp6I fragment located 3′ to the damage (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, during NER, the replaced region includes 20–24 nucleotides 5′ and 5–9 nucleotides 3′ to the damaged site (7.Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 23.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the 15-merCsp6I-Csp6I fragment, the 18-merSalG1-Csp6I fragment of the TG-containing DNA should be labeled during in vitro NER (Fig. 3 A). Both fragments contain equal amount of dAMP residues, thus dAMP incorporation into these fragments would reflect the relative contribution of NER and BER (long patch component) to the repair of TG in DNA by cell extracts. After incubation with whole cell extract, substrate DNA was purified from the reaction mixture, cleaved with SalG1 andCsp6I restriction endonucleases, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. We found that because of the slow rate of TG repair in whole cell extracts, a 3-h incubation period is needed to accumulate significant incorporation into the damage-containing fragment of the TG-containing DNA (data not shown). Analysis of the gel shown in Fig.3 B indicated that after 3 h of incubation with human cell extracts, some unspecific incorporation accumulates in both damaged and undamaged DNA constructs (the band at the very top of the gel). However, when normalized to the fragment length, the incorporation into the 15-mer Csp6I-Csp6I fragment, containing TG in substrate DNA, was about 10 times more than unspecific incorporation into the rest of the DNA. The incorporation of radioactive label into the 15-mer Csp6I-Csp6I fragment was highly DNA damage-specific, i.e. very little incorporation was seen in the corresponding fragment of the control DNA that was constructed by the same procedure as the TG-containing DNA, but contained a normal T:A base pair at the same position. The quantification of the data shown in the Fig. 3 B(representative gel of three independent experiments) revealed that incorporation into the 18-mer SalGI-Csp6I fragment, characteristic for NER, was similar in the TG-containing and control substrate. Most radioactive incorporation had accumulated in the 15-mer Csp6I-Csp6I fragment, indicating that the repair gap extended 3′ from the TG lesion. These results indicate that BER is the major pathway for repair of TG in DNA by human cell extracts. There are two major base excision repair pathways involving distinct sets of proteins and resulting in either a 1-nucleotide or a 2–6-nucleotide repair patch (24.Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25.Klungland A. Lindahl T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). By measuring an average repair patch size, it is possible to evaluate the relative involvement of different base excision repair pathways in the removal of DNA lesions. The TG-containing DNA was incubated with cell extract in the presence of all cofactors needed for DNA repair, including radioactive dTTP or dCTP. After incubation, the DNA was purified from the reaction mixture, cleaved with Csp6I restriction endonuclease, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 C). dTMP can be incorporated into the 15-mer Csp6I-Csp6I fragment during single nucleotide patch repair as well as during incorporation of the first nucleotide in long patch repair events. In contrast, dCMP incorporation solely reflects incorporation generated during long patch repair, because the first cytosine is located 3 nucleotides 3′ to the lesion (Fig. 3 A). The PhosphorImager quantification of the incorporation into the 15-mer Csp6I-Csp6I restriction fragment revealed that dTMP was incorporated 5–7 times more efficiently than dCMP (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that single nucleotide patch BER is the primary pathway for repair of TG in DNA by human cell extracts. A slow rate of TG repair has been observed in xeroderma pigmentosum group G/Cockayne syndrome cells, and it was suggested that the XPG protein plays a role in removal of this lesion (17.Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that excision of TG from DNA by the hNTH protein was stimulated by purified XPG protein (27.Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28.Bessho T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 24: 979-983Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies explored whether a deficiency in TG incision actually existed in a human cell extracts derived from patients with XP-G/CS clinical features. We thus investigated this question using cell extracts derived from XP-G/CS cells deficient in XPG protein. As a substrate we have used a 30-bp oligonucleotide duplex containing a single TG at the 16thposition and 5′-end 32P-labeled at the TG-containing strand. The incision of TG in the substrate oligonucleotide duplex in cell extracts generated a 15-mer labeled product (Fig.4). In a series of independent experiments we found a 20–25% reduction in the excision of TG-containing oligonucleotide duplex in XP-G/CS extracts when compared with wild type cell extracts. A representative gel is shown in Fig.4 A, and quantification of the results is presented in Fig.4 B. Although it has been broadly assumed that in mammalian cells TG in DNA is processed by BER, there has been no direct evidence to support this concept. Moreover, the ability of both bacterial and human NER enzymes to recognize and remove TG in DNA has been reported (14.Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 235: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15.Lin J.J. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16.Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of NER in processing of TG in DNA. We have now examined the relative roles of BER and NER in the repair of this lesion in human cell extracts. Because there is a general correlation between in vivo DNA repair and in vitro repair in cell extracts (29.Wood R. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 52: 93-106Google Scholar), our data likely reflect the repair of TG in DNA in living cells. The in vitro repair system we have employed in our experiments was optimized for NER (29.Wood R. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 52: 93-106Google Scholar) but has been demonstrated to be very effective for BER as well (30.Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell.

Our data show that in human cell extracts, under conditions of free competition between NER and BER repair systems, BER pathways processed the majority of TG in DNA.

This observation clearly demonstrates that the BER pathway is the first line of cellular defense against TG in DNA. Unlike uracil, TG generates significant structural changes in the double helix DNA structure and also unlike uracil, TG represents a block to the progression of DNA polymerases (4.Ide H. Kow Y.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9227-9236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our observation is unexpected and would suggest that, at least in this incidence and contrary to the general notion, the cellular choice of BER versus NER is not reflective of the DNA distortion or polymerase blockage of a given lesion. The observed repair activity of NER enzymes on TG-containing DNA may reflect a possible back up role of this system in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Under our experimental conditions we observed that removal of TG is much slower than repair of uracil or abasic sites in DNA. It is possible that more TG lesions can escape DNA repair prior to transcription or replication because of the slow repair rate. Because TG may constitute a strong block for both transcription and replication, the involvement of other repair systems, such as transcription-coupled repair or repair through homologous recombination, is more likely. Little is known about the molecular mechanism of transcription-coupled repair and its role in the repair of TG. It was shown that cells derived from XP-G patients that also exhibit clinical features characteristic for CS are defective in general genome and transcription-coupled repair of TG in DNA (17.Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It was further reported that these repair deficiencies correlate with the inability of the cell to produce full-length XPG protein (17.Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 36.Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Clarkson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Based on these data it was suggested that XPG protein has a role in repair of oxidative DNA damage distinctive from its role in NER (17.Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar,36.Nouspikel T. Lalle P. Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Clarkson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recently, two independent studies have shown that XPG protein stimulates the binding of human TG-DNA glycosylase (hNTH1 protein) to TG-containing DNA and accelerates the excision of TG (27.Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28.Bessho T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 24: 979-983Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this study we also addressed the role of XPG protein in repair of TG in DNA. We have used extracts prepared from human cells containing a truncatedXPG protein and find a 25% decrease in the TG excision activity in these extracts. These data indicate that the XPG protein is not an essential protein in the major pathway of BER but may have a stimulatory effect as has been previously suggested (27.Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, if TG located in template DNA inhibits transcription as was recently proposed by T. Bessho (28.Bessho T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 24: 979-983Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), XPG protein may function in transcription-coupled repair by recruiting the hNTH1 protein and probably other BER proteins to the site of damage in a stalled transcription complex. Our repair system is transcription uncoupled, so we would not be able to see the effect of XPG protein on transcription-coupled repair. Unfortunately, a cell free system for transcription-coupled repair is not yet available, and the role of the XPG protein in transcription-coupled removal of TG in DNA cannot be studied in vitro at this time. Robert M. Brosh and Simon G. Nyaga are thanked for critical reading of the manuscript."

The 5′-untranslated leader of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) genomic RNA is formed of highly structured domains involved in key steps of the viral life cycle. Thus, the presence of stable RNA structures between the 5′-cap and the gag start codon are thought to strongly inhibit scanning of a 43 S preinitiation ribosomal complex. This prompted us to look for an alternative to the canonical ribosome scanning. By using a standard bicistronic assay in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we show that the SIVmac 5′-leader contains an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) and that gene expression driven by this IRES is stimulated upon cleavage of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. Deletion analysis revealed that the sequence between the major splice donor and the gag AUG codon is required for IRES activity. DNA transfection and viral transduction experiments in both NIH-3T3 and COS-7 cells confirmed that translation driven by the SIV leader is IRES-dependent and thus insensitive to the immunosuppressant rapamycin. Identification of an IRES in SIV is of particular interest for the understanding of lentivirus replication and also for the design of novel lentiviral vectors suitable for gene transfer.

It is now recognized that the initiation step of translation is a determinant in the overall process of protein synthesis. For the vast majority of eukaryotic mRNAs, this occurs by a cap-dependent mechanism whereby the 40 S ribosomal subunit binds the m7GTP cap structure present at the 5′ terminus of virtually all eukaryotic mRNAs (except organelles). Subsequently, the ribosomal subunit migrates along the 5′-untranslated region until it encounters an AUG codon in a favorable context ((G/A)CCAUGG). This process involves a number of initiation factors that have been described to allow both mRNA binding and ribosome scanning (1.Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 2.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Among them, there are the cap-binding protein eIF4E,1 which specifically binds to the cap (3.Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar); eIF4A, which possesses RNA-dependent helicase activity (4.Pause A. Methot N. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6789-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); and eIF4G, which makes a bridge between the mRNA cap (via eIF4E) and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (via eIF3) (5.Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar).An alternative mechanism of translation initiation has been described with the study of the picornavirus family. This mechanism, called internal initiation, is rendered possible by an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES), which is a 450-nucleotide RNA sequence with complex secondary structures that allows translation by direct ribosome binding to the 5′-untranslated region (6.Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hellen C.U. Wimmer E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 31-63PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). This has first been described by inserting specific cis-acting sequences into the intercistronic spacer of a bicistronic construct coding for two proteins (9.Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 10.Jang S.K. Kraüsslich H. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the 3′-cistron proved the ability of the inserted sequence to promote internal ribosome binding and translation.Another major difference between cap-dependent and internal initiation of translation resides in the utilization of some of the canonical initiation factors. Whereas cap-dependent translation requires eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G, internal initiation can proceed in the absence of the cap-binding protein eIF4E (11.Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12.Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Moreover, after cleavage of eIF4G by picornavirus-encoded proteases, the carboxyl-terminal domain of eIF4G was shown to be sufficient to promote internal initiation (13.Ohlmann T. Rau M. Pain V. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14.Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 186-196PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of internal initiation has been reported for many other viral and cellular mRNAs. More recently, IRESs have been identified in retro-elements such as mouse VL30 (15.Lopez-Lastra M. Ulrici S. Gabus C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8393-8402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rat VL30 (16.Berlioz C. Torrent C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and several members of the retrovirus family, including Friend murine leukemia virus (17.Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) (18.Vagner S. Waysbort A. Marenda M. Gensac M.-C. Amalric F. Prats A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20376-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), human T-cell leukemia virus (19.Attal J. Theron M.C. Taboit F. Cajero-Juarez M. Kann G. Bolifraud P. Houdebine L.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and reticuloendotheliosis virus type A RNA (20.Lopez-Lastra M. Gabus C. Darlix J.-L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1855-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However and despite some attempt with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (21.Miele G. Mouland A. Harrison G.P. Cohen E. Lever A.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 944-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no IRES has yet been found in a lentivirus.The 5′-leader of SIVmac is long (537 nucleotides up to the AUG codon of gag) and formed by extended RNA structures necessary for key steps of the viral life cycle. This includes the highly structured TAR element, which forms a stable RNA stem-loop required for the activation of transcription. The leader also comprises the polyadenylation loop and the primer-binding site responsible for primer tRNA annealing. In addition, the leader of SIV also promotes the translation of gag and gag-polymerase precursor polyproteins.Both the length of this leader and the high degree of RNA secondary structures prompted us to look for the presence of an IRES element. We inserted the SIV leader between two reporter genes, and this resulted in the expression of the downstream cistron both in the RRL and in cells. Moreover, as reported for other IRESs, this expression was stimulated by the cleavage of eIF4G in vitro and upon treatment with the immunosuppressant rapamycin ex vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionStandard procedures were used for restriction nuclease digestion and plasmid DNA construction and purification. All numberings are with respect to the genomic RNA cap site (position +1). Details of the constructions are given below.pSIVThe SIV genomic leader from positions 1 to 537 was amplified by PCR, digested with NheI (PCR-added restriction site), and inserted into pMLV-CB63 previously digested withNheI (17.Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).pSIV-monoThe SIV leader in a monocistronic context was obtained by inserting the PCR fragment described above into pMLV-CB93 previously digested with NheI (17.Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).pSIV-invThe SIVmac genomic leader from positions 1 to 537 was amplified by PCR, digested with NheI, and inserted in the reverse orientation into pMLV-CB63 previously digested withNheI (17.Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this construct, β-galactosidase expression was promoted by an AUG codon in a good Kozak context (generated by PCR).pSIVΔ3′The SIV leader from positions 1 to 466 was amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotides were designed to change the GCA codon (nucleotides 462–464), creating an AUG codon in the context GTTAUGGG in frame with β-galactosidase protein. The resulting fragment was inserted into pMLV-CB63 previously digested withNheI (17.Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).pEMCV-D260–837This was as described previously (16.Berlioz C. Torrent C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).pMLV-SIV T1SIVmac DNA (positions 1–537) was generated by PCR, digested with NheI (site added with the PCR primer), and cloned between PLAP and neo of pMLV-CB71 (17.Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).pMLV-SIV T1 E+The EcoRI fragment of pEMCV-CBT4 (22.Torrent C. Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) containing the MLV 5′-long terminal repeat and MLV E+/IRES sequence was cloned into pMLV-SIV T1/EcoRI.In Vitro TranscriptionPrior to in vitro transcription, the plasmids were linearized with SspI, truncating the lacZ gene at position 1240. Transcription reactions were carried out with the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (23.Ohlmann T. Rau M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For synthesis of capped transcripts, the GTP concentration was reduced to 0.48 mm, and the m7GpppG cap analogue (New England Biolabs Inc.) was added at a concentration of 1.92 mm. At the end of the incubation period, the transcripts were purified on a Microspin S-400 microcolumn (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and precipitated with LiCl (7.5 m). The integrity of the RNAs was checked by electrophoresis on agarose gels, and their concentration was measured by spectrophotometry.In Vitro TranslationCapped and uncapped RNAs were translated in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of KCl (75 mm), MgCl2 (0.5 mm), 2-aminopurine (15 mm), and 20 μm each amino acid (except methionine). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of 0.6 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. Translation products were then separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography for 12 h using Biomax films (Eastman Kodak Co.).Oligonucleotides2′-O-Methyloligoribonucleotides were annealed to RNAs in 20 mm Hepes/KCl (pH 7.6) and 100 mm KCl for 3 min at 65 °C, followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature with a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides over mRNA. The mixture was then kept on ice until the addition of the translation mixture. The translation reaction was carried out as described above.Cell CultureMurine NIH-3T3 cells and the ecotropic packaging cell line GP+E-86 (24.Markozwitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the PG-13 helper cell line (25.Miller A.D. Garcia J.V. von Suhr N. Lynch C.M. Wilson C. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2220-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C with 10% newborn calf serum in a 5% CO2atmosphere. COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Transfection, Infection, and TitrationNIH-3T3 or ecotropic GP+E-86 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm plate 24 h prior to transfection with 20 μg of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method (26.Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were selected using G418 at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. The G418-resistant clones were mixed and expanded. The virus-containing medium of transfected cells was utilized for infection and titration of new cells. NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm plate 24 h prior to infection or at 2 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate for titration. Freshly harvested virus was filtered (0.45-μm pore size filter). Diluted virus-containing supernatants were overlaid onto cells in the presence of Polybrene, which was added at a concentration of 8 μg/ml. Cells were then incubated for 24 h, and the medium was replaced. Infected cells were grown for a total of 48 h and subjected to G418 selection at 0.8 mg/ml or stained for β-galactosidase or PLAP expression. The recombinant viral titer was determined by counting the number of LacZ- or PLAP-positive NIH-3T3 cells 48 h post-infection in limiting dilution assays. Titer, as transducing units/ml, was calculated by the following: (number of colonies) × (dilution of infecting retrovirus)/(total volume in ml of diluted vector overlaid onto cells).Histochemical StainingCells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were either stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside for LacZ activity or washed twice with AP buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mmMgCl2 in H2O) and stained with 0.1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium salt, and 1 mm levamisole in 1× AP buffer for PLAP activity.Enzymatic ActivitiesCell extracts were used as substrate for subsequent enzymatic assays. Cells were washed twice with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, scrapped using a rubber policeman, collected by centrifugation at 600 × g, and resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, and 30 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Nuclei were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA* protein assay reagent (Pierce). PLAP activity in cell extracts was determined spectrophotometrically (alkaline phosphatase substrate kit, Bio-Rad) using commercial calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a standard activity. The neomycin phosphotransferase activity (Neo) was measured by [γ-32P]ATP phosphate transfer to kanamycin.Western BlottingCells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation at 600 ×g. Cells were directly resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer, followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA* protein assay reagent. 10 μg of total protein were subjected to SDS-15% polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by semidry transfer in a 30% methanol/Tris/glycine buffer. The filter was blocked with 5% fat-free dried milk in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:800 dilution of rabbit anti-neomycin phosphotransferase II antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.®, Boulder, CO) in blocking buffer. After two 15-min washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated as described above in a 1:800 dilution of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio Sys, Compìegne, France). After two washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated for 30 min in VECTRASTAIN® Elite®ABC avidin/peroxidase solution (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Effect of Rapamycin on Protein Synthesis in Murine CellsCells were grown to 70–80% confluency and serum-starved for 48 h prior to the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and 50 ng/ml rapamycin (Sigma) or vehicle alone. 6 h after serum stimulation, protein extracts were prepared (see above). As described previously (20.Lopez-Lastra M. Gabus C. Darlix J.-L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1855-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), the level of reporter gene expression, measured by enzymatic activity or by Western blotting in the presence or absence of rapamycin, was used to calculate the effect of the drug as a percentage increase or decrease relative to untreated cells.DISCUSSIONInternal ribosome entry segments have been characterized in all picornaviruses identified to date (8.Jackson R.J.

In retroviruses, internal initiation has been shown to take place for gag precursor proteins of MLV type C retrovirus (17.Berlioz C. Darlix J.-L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Vagner S. Waysbort A. Marenda M. Gensac M.-C. Amalric F. Prats A.-C. J. Biol.

Here, we report for the first time in lentiviruses that the SIV leader contains an internal ribosome entry segment.The complete SIV leader was found capable of driving gene expression in a bicistronic context (Fig. 1). At the same RNA concentration, β-galactosidase expression was lower than that obtained with the EMCV IRES. Nonetheless, it should be noted that EMCV is one of the most efficient IRESs in the RRL (46.Borman A.M. Bailly J.L. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 25: 3656-3663Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The SIV leader in the reverse orientation failed to promote internal initiation, suggesting that SIV-directed translation results from specific features of the leader. By using the recombinant L protease from the foot-and-mouth-disease virus, we have shown that translation driven by the SIV leader is not impaired and rather is stimulated by the cleavage of the initiation factor eIF4G (Fig. 3), in agreement with a previous report (20.Lopez-Lastra M.

To characterize the cis-acting RNA sequences of the SIV leader involved in internal initiation, we truncated 72 nucleotides of the IRES. Translation of this construct showed a significant decrease in the expression of β-galactosidase. Interestingly this 72-nucleotide RNA segment is located between the major splice donor and the AUG initiation codon of gag and is therefore eliminated upon splicing of the genomic RNA.Finally, we have adapted the results of Johansson et al.(32.Johansson H.E. Belsham G.J. Sproat B.S. Hentze M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Le Tinevez et al. (31.Le Tinevez R. Mishra R.K. Toulme J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2273-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to design a novel experimental approach to characterize internal ribosome entry segments. Antisense 2′-O-methyloligoribonucleotides were hybridized to different regions of the SIV 5′-leader in a bicistronic context. The chemical modification of the 2′-OH group stabilizes these oligonucleotides against degradation, and they display a strong affinity for complementary RNA sequences (47.Lamond A.I. Sproat B.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As previously reported, binding of 2′-O-methyloligoribonucleotides anywhere within the 5′-untranslated region of a reporter RNA blocked cap-dependent translation initiation with high specificity, and this was due to impairment of the progression of a scanning 43 S preinitiation complex (31.Le Tinevez R. Mishra R.K. Toulme J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2273-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32.Johansson H.E. Belsham G.J. Sproat B.S. Hentze M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resulting oligonucleotide/mRNA hybrids cannot be displaced, as they do not seem to be recognized by RNA helicases involved in translation (32.Johansson H.E. Belsham G.J. Sproat B.S. Hentze M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our experiments, translation of these oligonucleotide/mRNA hybrids revealed that oligos 1 and 2 did not affect the pattern of gene expression driven by the SIV leader, whereas oligo 3 (which encompasses the initiating AUG codon) was inhibitory. These data suggest that the 5′-proximal region of the SIV leader is not scanned by a 43 S preinitiation complex.To further assess the data presented above, we studied translation driven by the SIV leader in cell culture. Using stably transfected cells, we showed that SIV-driven expression was not inhibited, but instead was stimulated upon treatment with rapamycin. The increase in cap-independent protein expression in the presence of the L protease (Fig. 4) or rapamycin (Fig. 7) probably reflects competition between the 5′-cap structure and the IRES for the recruitment of initiation factors. In agreement with previous studies by Beretta et al. (27.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), it should be noted that rapamycin inhibited cap-dependent protein synthesis by only 30–40%. However, this is sufficient to show that expression of the second cistron (driven by the SIV leader) occurs independently from that of the first one and is not the result of a termination-reinitiation mechanism.Viral transduction experiments showed that the SIV leader could be used in a retroviral vector, suggesting that the SIV leader does not interfere with the upstream packaging sequences of MLV. Surprisingly, a competition effect was also observed when the two IRESs (MLV and SIV) cohabited in the pMLV-SIV T1 E+ construct. In this particular case, the SIV IRES was more efficiently expressed in NIH-3T3 cells than in COS-7 cells, whereas PLAP activity was higher in COS-7 than in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 7). These variations are likely to depend on the relative strength of the IRES (46.Borman A.M. Bailly J.L. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 25: 3656-3663Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the cell type (48.Borman A.M. Le Mercier P. Girard M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These relative levels of expression should be taken into account for the design of bicistronic retroviral vectors to ensure stable expression and optimum IRES activity in different cell types.To date, IRES elements have been identified in the genomic RNA of several retroviruses and retro-elements, suggesting that they may be present in most, if not all, retroviruses. The full-length genomic RNA acts both as mRNA and as genomic RNA. However, based on the current models of genomic RNA packaging, both functions do not seem compatible. One possibility is that two pools of RNA coexist in the cytoplasm of the infected cell: one for translation and one for packaging (49.Levin J.G. Rosenak M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 50.Messer L.I. Levin J.G. Chattopadhyay S.K. J. Virol. 1981; 40: 683-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, the RNA that will be selected for packaging must be inhibited at the translational level. It is tempting to speculate that this inhibition may be mediated by the binding (or the absence of binding) of a factor to the IRES.Another possibility is that there is only one pool of RNA; this RNA would first be used as a messenger to synthesize the viral proteins necessary for dimerization, packaging, and release of the virions. In this case, translation of this unique genomic RNA must be tightly controlled to stop producing proteins and to allow packaging. Once again, this switch between translation and replication could be controlled at the level of the IRES. Translational control is a major contributor to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. It is now recognized that the initiation step of translation is a determinant in the overall process of protein synthesis. For the vast majority of eukaryotic mRNAs, this occurs by a cap-dependent mechanism whereby the 40 S ribosomal subunit binds the m7GTP cap structure present at the 5′ terminus of virtually all eukaryotic mRNAs (except organelles). Subsequently, the ribosomal subunit migrates along the 5′-untranslated region until it encounters an AUG codon in a favorable context ((G/A)CCAUGG). This process involves a number of initiation factors that have been described to allow both mRNA binding and ribosome scanning (1.Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 2.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Among them, there are the cap-binding protein eIF4E,1 which specifically binds to the cap (3.Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar); eIF4A, which possesses RNA-dependent helicase activity (4.Pause A. Methot N. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6789-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); and eIF4G, which makes a bridge between the mRNA cap (via eIF4E) and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (via eIF3) (5.Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism of translation initiation has been described with the study of the picornavirus family. This mechanism, called internal initiation, is rendered possible by an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES), which is a 450-nucleotide RNA sequence with complex secondary structures that allows translation by direct ribosome binding to the 5′-untranslated region (6.Ehrenfeld E. Semler B.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hellen C.U. Wimmer E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 31-63PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). This has first been described by inserting specific cis-acting sequences into the intercistronic spacer of a bicistronic construct coding for two proteins (9.Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 10.Jang S.K. Kraüsslich H. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J.

During its life cycle, T. cruzi passes through three developmental stages. In their insect vectors, the parasites multiply as extracellular epimastigotes in the midgut, migrate to the hindgut, and then differentiate into nondividing trypomastigotes. These infective organisms are excreted in the feces after a blood meal. When they contaminate the puncture site or mucous membranes of a mammalian host, they can invade a variety of cell types. Once inside host cells, the trypomastigotes differentiate into amastigotes, which multiply in the cytoplasm. After many cycles of proliferation, the amastigotes differentiate into trypomastigotes and enter the circulation when the host cell ruptures. These trypomastigotes perpetuate either the infection or the life cycle when they invade other host cells or are ingested by insect vectors, respectively. Since the intracellular amastigotes are at the core of the persistence of T. cruzi infection, we previously sought to identify genes that are preferentially expressed by amastigotes in order to develop a better understanding of the molecular biology of this parasite form. We identified two novel genes, encoding the proteins amastin and tuzin, which occur in alternating tandemly arranged pairs (1.Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol.

Less is understood about tuzin's function or location, but it possesses sequence similarity to a heterotrimeric G-protein. Most tandem genes in T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids, such as Leishmania species and African trypanosomes, do not have recognizable upstream promoters and are transcribed into polycistronic precursor RNAs (3.Vanhamme L.

The 5′ ends of the resulting mature monocistronic mRNAs are defined by thetrans-splicing of a 39-nucleotide spliced leader (SL)1 sequence, and the 3′ ends of the mRNAs are generated by polyadenylation (3.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Graham S.V. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 217-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8.Hug M. Hotz H.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In general, polyadenylation of the upstream coding region in the precursor RNA is coupled with the SL trans-addition of the downstream coding region (10.Ullu E. Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11.LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although amastin and tuzin genes are present in alternating pairs and are transcribed at equal levels in amastigotes and epimastigotes, the steady state level of amastin mRNA in amastigotes is at least 68-fold higher than in epimastigotes (2.Teixeira S.M. Russell D.G. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20509-20516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tuzin mRNA, however, is at an equally low level in the two life cycle stages and is approximately as abundant as amastin mRNA in epimastigotes. Thus, post-transcriptional controls must confer this dramatic life cycle-specific gene regulation. The abundance levels of several other life cycle-specific trypanosomatid mRNAs, such as the mRNAs encoding theTrypanosoma brucei procyclin and hexose transporters, andLeishmania gp63 and hsp83 have been shown to be dependent on sequences within their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) (4.Aly R.

Parasitol. 1996; 77: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, our previous studies indicated that the amastin 3′-UTR is also necessary for its post-transcriptional up-regulation in amastigotes (1.Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). There are numerous examples in other eukaryotic systems of cis-elements in 3′-UTRs of mRNAs that confer either stability, translatability, or precursor RNA processing signals (16.Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 18.Higgins C.F. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and it is thought that many of these cis-elements act in concert with trans-acting factors that are ultimately responsible for the fate of the RNA (19.Pham V.P. Rothman P.B. Gottesdiener K.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In trypanosomatids, due to the absence of polymerase II promoters and heavy reliance on post-transcriptional control, there is perhaps even greater dependence on regulatory cis-acting RNA elements andcis-trans interactions. However, despite their inferred significance, very little is understood about the molecular mechanisms underlying these regulatory RNA sequences, and even less is known about their protein interactions. We report here that three potentially linked mechanisms are responsible for the up-regulation of amastin mRNA in amastigotes. First, the half-life of the amastin mRNA is 7 times longer in amastigotes than epimastigotes. Second, positive regulatory elements occur within the central one-third of the amastin mRNA's 630-bp 3′-UTR. This central portion of the amastin 3′-UTR is essential for up-regulation of a reporter gene, and the positive effect is rigidly dependent on the distance of the regulatory 3′-UTR segment from the stop codon and the polyadenylation site, as well as on its orientation. Third, a 30–36-kDa protein or protein complex in amastigote extracts, but not in epimastigote extracts, binds to the essential 3′-UTR regulatorycis-element. The Tulahuén strain ofT. cruzi was used for all experiments (20.Pizzi T. Ph.D. thesis. Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile1957Google Scholar). Epimastigotes were maintained in logarithmic growth phase at 26 °C in supplemented liver digest-neutralized tryptose medium as described previously (21.Kirchhoff L.V. Hieny S. Shiver G.M. Snary D. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2731-2735PubMed Google Scholar). Culture-derived amastigotes were obtained by infecting monolayers of the RA786 renal carcinoma cell line (22.Williams R.D. Elliot A.Y. Stein N. Fraley E.E. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) grown at 37 °C in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5%l-glutamine, and 5% penicillin/streptomycin. Amastigotes were purified by centrifugation in metrizamide gradients as described previously (2.Teixeira S.M. Russell D.G. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20509-20516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 108 parasites in 5 ml of liver digest-neutralized tryptose medium received 72 μg of actinomycin D in 8 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and were allowed to incubate for various time periods. Time point 0 received no actinomycin D. After incubation for the appropriate time, cells were pelleted and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Total RNA was harvested using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Either 40 μg of epimastigote RNA or 10 μg of amastigote RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.1% agarose/MOPS/formaldehyde gel. The gel was blotted to nitrocellulose, cross-linked, and hybridized at 42 °C with a radiolabeled amastin 3′-UTR probe generated with the Random Prime System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following washing at 65 °C in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, radioactivity was measured using a Hewlett-Packard Instant Imager. The blots were then reprobed using a radiolabeled rRNA fragment, and again the signal was quantitated to allow normalization for the amount of RNA present in each lane. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are presented in TableI. Nucleotide numbering of the 3′-UTR is referenced from the amastin stop codon. All plasmids used in transfection experiments were derived from either pGEM-luc (Promega Corp.) or the pGEX-β-gal (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subcloning strategies to generate plasmids pLTCR27, pTCR27, and pLRA were described previously (1.Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol.

The plasmid containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene was constructed by replacing the luciferase coding region of pLRT, flanked by the BamHI andStuI sites, with an enzymatically excised β-galactosidase coding region obtained from pGEX-β-gal.Table IOligonucleotides used in the studyOligonucleotideSequenceF.

The two halves of the amastin 3′-UTR and IR were then ligated together. To generate the linker replacement plasmids by modifying the pLRA plasmid, we synthesized PCR primers containing nonendogenousPstI and HindIII sites that hybridize to successive 70-bp segments in the 3′-UTR and amplify in opposite directions (Fig. 2 A). After PCR amplifications using either the PstI primer paired with a primer that hybridized at the 3′ end of the luciferase coding region, or the HindIII primer paired with the T7 primer hybridizing in the vector sequence, the two PCR products were digested with either PstI orHindIII. The PCR-amplified and digested 3′-UTR fragments were ligated to a synthetic 70-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide linker containing ends compatible for PstI andHindIII ligation. The linker sequence was designed to contain the same relative base composition as that of the amastin 3′-UTR and was manipulated by the SHUFFEL and SQUIGGLES (Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package) programs so that it would not contain any known RNA regulatory motifs or thermodynamically stable RNA secondary structures. The reconstructed 3′-UTR with its native 70 bp replaced by the synthetic linker was then ligated into pGEM-luc digested with ClaI andSacI. The central portion of the amastin 3′-UTR was amplified using oligonucleotides A2 and A6 that hybridize to regions immediately downstream from the h6 and h4 oligonucleotide hybridization sites (Fig. 2 A). This amplification generated a fragment designated A2A6. The A2A6 fragment was positioned downstream from the luciferase coding region into the XhoI site of the pLTCR27 plasmid and upstream of the full-length TCR27 3′-UTR to generate the four plasmids pLTCR27/A2A6(+1x), -(+3x), -(−1x), and -(−2x). The chimeric 3′-UTRs containing the TCR27 3′-UTR and the amastin 3′-UTR were generated by PCR amplification of theTCR27 UTR's 5′ and 3′ halves using oligonucleotides A502.3, S208.5, S0.5, and A231.3 (Table I). The 5′-half of the TCR27UTR, the central portion of the amastin 3′-UTR and the 3′ half of theTCR27 UTR were then ligated and inserted into pGEM-luc. Since the amastin 3′-UTR fragment had blunt ends, it could be ligated in either orientation and in multiple copies. To generate the plasmids that contained the amastin 3′-UTR element inserted within the TCR27 3′-UTR (plasmids pLTCR27/A2A6 (+1x)/mid and pLTCR27/A2A6 (−1x)/mid)), oligonucleotides were generated to separately amplify the 3′ and 5′ portions of theTCR27 3′-UTR. The two halves of the TCR27 3′-UTR were then ligated to the A2A6 fragment. To provide templates for in vitro transcription from either a T3 or T7 polymerase promoter, the wild type amastin 3′-UTR from the pGEM-luc construct was subcloned into the plasmid pBSK+/−. The linker mutants were subcloned into BamHI and KpnI sites of pBSK+/−, and the A2A6 fragment was subcloned into the EcoRV site. Plasmid DNA used for transfection was prepared by alkaline lysis of host bacteria followed by column purification (Qiagen). Transfections of epimastigotes or amastigotes were performed with either 15 or 50 μg of circular plasmid DNA. All test plasmids were co-transfected with an equal quantity of the β-galactosidase encoding plasmid. Briefly, 108 parasites were washed in 350 μl of PBS, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2. Cell suspensions were mixed with 50 μl of plasmid DNA, and after a 10-min incubation on ice, they were subjected to one pulse at 500 V and 450 microfarads in a 0.2-cm cuvette using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Ten minutes after electroporation, epimastigotes were transferred to 5 ml of liver digest-neutralized tryptose medium and incubated at 26 °C for 48 h. Amastigotes were transferred to a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask containing 50% confluent RA786 cells with 5 ml of supplemented RPMI and were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. For luciferase and β-galactosidase assays, the cells were harvested, washed in PBS, transferred to 1.5-ml capped tubes, and centrifuged for 10 s at 10,000 × g. The pellets were suspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifuging for 1 min at 10,000 × g, two aliquots of 10 μl of a 1:5 dilution (epimastigotes) or two aliquots of 20 μl (amastigotes) were assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (3.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays for β-galactosidase activity were performed with a similar volume of lysate using the CLONTECH Laboratoriessystem. Parasite protein extracts were generated by pelleting 108 cells, washing two times in PBS, and lysing in 20 μl of Munro's buffer (200 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After a 10-min incubation on ice, 180 μl of Munro's buffer was added, and the cells were passed 10 times through a 23-gauge needle. Lysates were then centrifuged at maximum speed in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and protein concentration was determined by a standard Bradford assay. Mammalian cell extracts were generated similarly, with the exception that only 106 cells were used, 80 μl of Munro's buffer was added after initial lysis, and cells were passaged through a 100-μl pipette tip. Plasmids were linearized at the polylinker sites just downstream or upstream from the cloned insert and transcribed with either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase to generate sense or antisense RNAs. Radiolabeled RNAs were synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, using conditions recommended by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The integrity of the transcribed product was assessed by electrophoresing either 106 cpm or 500 ng of RNA in an ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose/MOPS/formaldehyde gel, blotting to nitrocellulose, and performing conventional autoradiography. Alternatively, the size of the in vitrotranscribed RNA was compared with that of RNA markers. The full-length amastin 3′-UTR and IR RNA probes contained the sequences immediately downstream from the luciferase stop codon to the end of the amastin/tuzin IR (1.3 kb). The A2A6 domain of the amastin 3′-UTR contains the region flanked by these primers (210 bp). In vitro transcribed RNA (10,000–65,000 cpm) was incubated with 40 μg of protein from the appropriate cell extract. Nonradioactive RNA competitor, if needed, was added 10 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled RNA. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the samples were cross-linked by exposure to an x-ray source of 3500 (× 100) μJ at a distance of 4 cm. Samples were then incubated with 10 units of RNase TI for 10 min at room temperature followed by another 10-min incubation with heparin at 5 mg/ml. Samples were boiled in loading buffer and separated in a 5% stacking, 10% resolving Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 100 V. The gel was dried onto Whatman paper and subsequently used to expose film. Prior to mRNA half-life determination, each time point was normalized to the relative hybridization signal from a ribosomal RNA probe to adjust for slight differences in the quantity of RNA in each lane. Half-lives for each experiment were determined by linear regressions drawn by the Microsoft Excel program. The mRNA half-lives are presented as the mean and S.D. of each experiment. Student's unpaired t test was employed to compare amastigote and epimastigote mRNA half-lives. Luciferase percentages are given as normalized averages of at least six independent samples assayed in duplicate. Efficiency of transfection was assessed by co-transfecting the β-galactosidase encoding plasmid with each test plasmid and normalizing to β-galactosidase activity. If the normalized values deviated from the control plasmid by more than 15%, that sample was eliminated from consideration. The luciferase value of the wild type 3′-UTRs was set at 100%, and the corresponding values obtained with the mutant 3′-UTRs were adjusted accordingly. We reported previously that the steady state level of amastin mRNA is 68-fold greater in amastigotes than in epimastigotes (1.Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2.Teixeira S.M. Russell D.G. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20509-20516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the extent to which mRNA stability is responsible for this difference, the half-lives of the amastin mRNA derived from these two life cycle stages were determined. Since the abundance of the amastin mRNA in epimastigotes is relatively low and since T. cruzi parasites require longer than 1 h to adequately pulse and chase with radioactive nucleotides (data not shown), we could not use a pulse-chase technique for RNA half-life determination. We chose instead to track amastin mRNA decay by terminating transcription with actinomycin D. In a [3H]uracil uptake assay, 72 μg of actinomycin D/ml/108 parasites was determined to be sufficient to stop >90% of RNA synthesis (data not shown). To analyze the decay rates of the amastin mRNA, amastigotes and epimastigotes were incubated in the presence of this amount of actinomycin D, and total RNA was harvested at various time points. The amount of amastin mRNA was then determined by Northern blot analysis and quantitated on a Hewlett Packard Instant Imager (Fig.1). After normalizing to the hybridization signal of a 24αS rRNA probe to adjust for differences in the quantity of RNA loaded in each lane, the amastin mRNA half-life in amastigotes was found to be 74 ± 11 min. The decay rate in epimastigotes was much faster, with a half-life of only 11 ± 5 min. These results suggest that amastin mRNA is either stabilized in amastigotes and/or destabilized in epimastigotes. The approximately 7-fold difference in decay rates accounts in part for the dramatic 68-fold difference reported earlier for the steady state levels of the amastin mRNA in the two life cycle stages. The increase in amastin mRNA in amastigotes immediately following the addition of actinomycin D is probably due to a temporary stress-induced increase in total mRNA levels prior to terminating transcription. Similar temporary increases in mRNA abundance following actinomycin D addition have been documented elsewhere (9.Vassella E. Braun R. Roditi I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This increase, however, does not preclude extrapolation of a relative mRNA decay rate, since decay values calculated from either the 0 or 10 min time point are not significantly different. Because of precedents in other eukaryotic cells as well as in other trypanosomatids, we suspected that cis-acting elements in the amastin/tuzin gene cluster could be responsible for the markedly higher level of amastin mRNA in amastigotes than in epimastigotes. To test this possibility, in an earlier study we PCR-amplified from a genomic clone of the gene cluster the region between the amastin stop codon and the start codon of the downstream tuzin gene. This segment was designated the amastin 3′-UTR and IR. This fragment was then inserted into an expression plasmid downstream from a cassette containing a T. cruzi rRNA gene promoter, the amastin gene's 5′-UTR and IR, and a luciferase reporter gene for expression in a transient transfection assay. The regulatory effects conferred by the amastin 3′-UTR and IR, as reflected by luciferase production in transiently transfected amastigotes and epimastigotes, was compared with the expression regulated by the 3′-UTR and IR of the constitutively expressed T. cruzi TCR27 gene (23.Otsu K. Donelson J.E. Kirchhoff L.V. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,24.Otsu K. Donelson J.E. Kirchhoff L.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This gene encodes a cytoskeleton protein whose mRNA level is the same in amastigotes and epimastigotes. Relative to the expression controlled by the TCR27 3′-UTR and IR, the amastin 3′-UTR and IR decreased luciferase activity 5-fold in epimastigotes and increased luciferase activity 7-fold in amastigotes (1.Teixeira S.M.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, in this earlier work we documented that the amastin 3′-UTR and IR affect expression in both a positive and negative manner, depending on which developmental stage contains the reporter plasmid. Comparison of six independently cloned amastin cDNAs revealed virtually no variability among the 630-bp 3′-UTRs. Consequently, since no 3′-UTR region was more highly conserved than another region, by comparison alone we could not predict which, if any, segment might affect the regulation observed in the initial transfection experiments. Therefore, to characterize further the role of the amastin 3′-UTR and IR in the differential expression of amastin mRNAs, plasmids were constructed that contain truncations in either the 3′-UTR or IR or both (Fig. 2). One mutated 3′-UTR contains a 250-bp deletion of the 3′ half. Another plasmid was engineered to have a 100-bp deletion in the IR. These altered versions of the amastin 3′-UTR and IR were transiently expressed in epimastigotes and amastigotes, and the relative luciferase values were determined. Compared with luciferase expression under the control of the full-length 3′-UTR and IR, the truncated 3′-UTR resulted in a small increase in the amount of luciferase activity in epimastigotes (119%) and a dramatic decrease in expression in amastigotes (12%). These results suggest that the deleted 3′-UTR contributes to the different steady state levels of amastin mRNA in epimastigotes and amastigotes. Deletions of the IR had no effect on luciferase activity in epimastigotes (102%) but decreased it 5-fold (20%) in amastigotes compared with that induced by the native sequence. To identify more completely the 3′-UTR cis-elements responsible for the observed differential regulation, a more refined linker scanning mutagenesis approach rather than more deletion analyses was adopted. Contiguous 70-bp segments of the 630-bp 3′-UTR were replaced with a double-stranded, 70-bp synthetic oligonucleotide. This synthetic linker maintained the relative nucleotide base composition of the amastin 3′-UTR but was designed to contain no known RNA regulatory motifs or thermodynamically stable secondary structures. The nine insertions of the 70-bp linker constructs span the entire 630-bp 3′-UTR and, similar to the plasmids shown in Fig. 2, are downstream from a luciferase gene under the control of an rRNA promoter and an amastin SL addition site (Fig. 3). The linker plasmids were transiently expressed in epimastigotes and amastigotes, and luciferase activity was determined and adjusted for the efficiency of transfection. None of the replacement regions had a dramatic effect on luciferase expression in epimastigotes, although when the linker was at the 5′-most position (i.e. pLRA:h9), there was an increase in luciferase activity to 133 ± 11% above that of the uninterrupted 3′-UTR (100 ± 11%). One interpretation of this result is that the linker replaced a modest epimastigote-specific negative regulatorycis-element, thus relieving the repressive effects of the native sequence. When the linker was moved in the 3′ direction, as in constructs pLRA:h8 through pLRA:h1, there was minimal to no effect on reporter activity in epimastigotes, presumably because the negative regulating cis-element is confined to the h9 position. In contrast to the transfections in epimastigotes, replacements of several segments of the 3′-UTR ha"

To elucidate the role of FGF-16, we examined the expression of FGF-16mRNA in rat embryonic brown adipose tissue at different developmental stages by Northern blotting analysis and in situ hybridization. FGF-16 mRNA was expressed abundantly in brown adipose tissue during embryonic day 17.5, embryonic days 17.5–19.5, and thereafter at lower levels into the neonatal period. The expression profile of FGF-16 mRNA well corresponds to the proliferative profile of embryonic brown adipose tissue reported. We also examined the mitogenic activity of recombinant rat FGF-16 for primary brown adipocytes prepared from rat embryonic brown adipose tissue. FGF-16 showed significant mitogenic activity for primary brown adipocytes. The mitogenic activity was found to be exerted by binding and activating FGF receptor-4 in the brown adipose tissue.

There are two types of adipose tissues, white and brown. Their physiological roles are quite different. White adipose tissue stores energy, whereas brown adipose tissue dissipates energy. Brown adipose tissue is a specialized tissue of mammals responsible for facultative thermogenesis. Its physiological significance has been recognized in newborns when the decrease in environmental temperature at birth requires an adaptive increase in heat production (1.Giralt M. Martin I. Iglesias R. Vinas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Brown adipose tissue is also speculated to normally function to prevent obesity. Indeed, transgenic mice with primary deficiency of brown adipose tissue have obesity, which develops in the absence of hyperphagia. As obesity progresses, transgenic animals develop hyperphagia (2.Lowell B.B., S- Susulic V. Hamann A. Lawitts J.A. Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). These results support a critical role for brown adipose tissue in the nutritional homeostasis of mice. The prototypic fibroblast growth factors (FGFs),1 FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF), were originally isolated from the brain and pituitary as mitogens for fibroblasts (3.Baird A. Klagsbrun M.

The FGF family now consists of 19 members, FGF-1 to FGF-19 (5.Ohbayashi N. Hoshikawa M. Kimura S. Yamasaki M. Fukui S. Itoh N. J. Biol.

FGFs are widely expressed in developing and adult tissues and appear to have important roles with multiple biological activities, including angiogenesis, mitogenesis, cellular differentiation, and repair of tissue injury (3.Baird A.

In rat embryos, FGF-16 mRNA was predominantly expressed in brown adipose tissue, indicating that FGF-16 plays a unique role in embryonic brown adipose tissue (9.Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H.

In the present study, we examined the expression of FGF-16 mRNA in rat brown adipose tissue at different developmental stages in embryos and during cold acclimation in adults and the mitogenic activity of FGF-16 for primary rat brown adipocytes. The present findings indicate that FGF-16 is a unique growth factor involved in proliferation of embryonic brown adipose tissue. RNA was prepared from Wistar rat brown adipose tissue using an RNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots of RNA were dissolved on a denaturing agarose gel (1%) containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 20× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate) overnight.

An35S-labeled rat FGF-16 antisense cRNA probe was transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) with uridine 5′-α-[35S]thiotriphosphate (∼30 TBq/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 35S-Labeled rat FGF receptor antisense cRNA probes were prepared as described (17.Yazaki N.

The sections were examined by in situ hybridization with the labeled antisense probe as described (9.Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm-β max, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 days. The labeled sections were also dipped in liquid emulsion (Kodak NTB3) diluted 1:1 with water. After 4 weeks of exposure, they were developed with D-19 (Eastman Kodak Co.) and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Interscapular brown adipose tissue was dissected out from rat embryos at embryonic day 21.5. Primary brown adipocytes were prepared from the brown adipose tissue essentially according to the method of Bronnikov et al. (15.Bronnikov G. Houstek J. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2006-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The brown adipose tissue was incubated in Hanks' solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% crude collagenase type I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell suspension was cooled on ice for 15 min, and the infranatant was filtered through a 200-μm nylon screen and centrifuged for 5 min at 700 × g. The packed cells were washed with medium 199 and suspended in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant rat FGF-16 was prepared in Escherichia coli as described (12.Danilenko D.M. Montestruque S. Philo J.S. Tiansheng L. Hill D. Speakman J. Bahru M. Zhang M. Konishi M. Itoh N. Chirica M.

Mitogenic activity of recombinant rat FGF-16 for primary rat embryonic brown adipocytes cultured in a serum-free medium was determined essentially according to the method of Teruel et al. (20.Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Primary rat embryonic brown adipocytes were plated onto 24-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) and cultured in modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h in culture at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were cultured in modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 20 h at 37 °C. The cells were further cultured in modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0–25 ng/ml recombinant rat FGF-16. After 20 h, [methyl-3H]thymidine (740 GBq/mmol, 7.4 KBq/ml/well) (NEN Life Science Products) was added to the culture medium, and the cells were further cultured for 4 h. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into acid-insoluble material was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. The cDNAs encoding extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain III with surrounding regions of FGF receptors 1 and 2 (FGFR-1 and FGFR-2) were amplified from rat embryonic brown adipose tissue cDNA (embryonic day 19.5) by polymerase chain reaction. Alternatively spliced variants were identified by determination of the nucleotide sequence of theFGFR-1 cDNA and enzymatic digestion of theFGFR-2 cDNA with HaeIII as described (18.Miyake A. Hattori Y. Ohta M. Itoh N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of rat FGFR-1c, mouse FGFR-2c, or rat FGFR-4 with a DNA fragment encoding an E-tag (GAPVPYPDPLEPR) and a hexameric His tag (HHHHHH) at the 3′ terminus was constructed in a transfer vector DNA,pBacPAK9 (CLONTECH). Recombinant baculovirus containing the cDNA was obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with the recombinant pBacPAK9 and aBacPAK6 DNA (Bsu36 digest) (CLONTECH). High Five cells (approximately 2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus and incubated at 27 °C for 65 h in serum-free medium EX-CELL 400 (JRH Biosciences). The culture medium was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and applied to a column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN) in PBS containing 20 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl. After washing the column with PBS containing 20 mmimidazole and 0.5 m NaCl, the recombinant extracellular domain was eluted from the column with PBS containing 250 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl and dialyzed against PBS. FGF-16 or FGF-2 as a control was fixed on the sensor tip CM5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding of the recombinant extracellular domain of FGFR-1c, FGFR-2c, or FGFR-4 to the FGF on the tip was analyzed using the BIACORE 2000 system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The equilibrium dissociation constant was determined by the BIA evaluation software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wistar rats (8 weeks old) were kept at 4 °C for 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 1 week in individual cages with a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule as described (10.Bukowiecki L.J. Geloen A. Collet A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C880-C887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the expression of FGF-16 mRNA and UCP-1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue at different developmental stages (embryonic days 19.5, 20.5, and 21.5 and postnatal day 1) by Northern blotting analysis. UCP-1, a unique mitochondrial protein that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from the respiratory chain is a marker specific for brown adipose tissue differentiation (1.Giralt M. Martin I. Iglesias R. Vinas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). UCP-1 mRNA was expressed at low levels at embryonic day 19.5. However, the expression was increased greatly from embryonic day 20.5 (Fig. 1). In contrast,FGF-16 mRNA was most abundantly expressed at embryonic day 19.5. The expression was decreased as development proceeded and greatly decreased after birth (Fig. 1). We also examined the expression of FGF-16 mRNA in brown adipose tissue at earlier developmental stages (embryonic days 16.5, 17.5, 18.5, and 19.5). Since it was difficult to prepare sufficient amounts of RNA from brown adipose tissue at these stages for Northern blotting analysis, we examined the expression of FGF-16 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Sagittal sections of rat embryos were analyzed by in situ hybridization with an 35S-labeledFGF-16 antisense cRNA probe (Fig.2). FGF-16 mRNA was weakly detected in the interscapular area at embryonic day 16.5 (data not shown). However, FGF-16 mRNA was significantly detected in brown adipose tissue even at embryonic days 17.5 and 18.5 as well as embryonic day 19.5 (Fig. 2). The cellular localization ofFGF-16 mRNA in brown adipose tissue was also examined.FGF-16 mRNA was detected in most cells in brown adipose tissue (data not shown).Figure 2Expression of FGF-16mRNA in rat brown adipose tissue at different developmental stages (embryonic days 17.5–19.5). Sagittal sections of rat embryos at different developmental stages (embryonic days 17.5, 18.5, and 19.5 (E17.5, E18.5, and E19.5, respectively)) were hybridized with an 35S-labeled antisense FGF-16 probe. The sections were exposed to x-ray film (A, D, and G). Scale bar, 5.0 mm. The sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Although the primary adipocytes were potentially heterogeneous, most of the cells differentiated into mature adipocytes (data not shown). We examined the mitogenic activity of recombinant rat FGF-16 for the primary adipocytes by determining [3H]thymidine incorporation. FGF-16 showed significant mitogenic activity for primary brown adipocytes (Fig.3). FGFs bind and activate FGF receptors. The cloning of FGF receptors has identified four distinct genes, FGFR-1 toFGFR-4 (19.Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). The expression of FGF receptor mRNAs in rat embryonic brown adipose tissue at embryonic day 19.5 was examined byin situ hybridization. FGFR-1, FGFR-2, and FGFR-4 mRNAs, but not FGFR-3 mRNA, were found to be expressed in the brown adipose tissue (Fig.4). FGFR-1 to FGFR-3 have two alternatively spliced immunoglobulin-like domains, IIIb and IIIc. These spliced variants have different ligand specificities (19.Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G.

Unlike FGFR-1 to FGFR-3, FGFR-4 is not alternatively spliced in this region. To identify the spliced variants of FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 expressed in the brown adipose tissue, we amplified FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 cDNAs encoding the immunoglobulin-like domain with the surrounding regions from the brown adipose tissue cDNA by polymerase chain reaction and examined the spliced variants of these receptors by determination of theFGFR-1 cDNA sequence or the enzymatic digestion of theFGFR-2 cDNA with HaeIII. FGFR-1c and FGFR-2c, but not FGFR-1b and FGFR-2b, were found to be expressed in the brown adipose tissue (data not shown). To examine which FGF receptor (FGFR-1c, FGFR-2c, or FGFR-4) could bind FGF-16, recombinant extracellular domains of these receptors produced in insect cells were prepared. Since FGF-2 was shown to efficiently bind to FGFR-1c, FGFR-2c, and FGFR-4 (19.Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), we also examined the binding of FGF-2 to recombinant extracellular domains of these FGF receptors. All three extracellular domains were found to bind FGF-2 with high affinity (Table I). The binding of FGF-16 to these receptors was also examined. In contrast to FGF-2, FGF-16 was found to bind to only the extracellular domain of FGFR-4 with high affinity and not to those of FGFR-1c and FGFR-2c (Table I).Table IBinding of FGFs to FGF receptorsk dk aK ds−1m−1 · s−1mFGF-2/FGFR-1c3.89 × 10−31.23 × 1053.17 × 10−8FGF-2/FGFR-2c3.65 × 10−31.76 × 1052.06 × 10−8FGF-2/FGFR-42.07 × 10−31.32 × 1051.57 × 10−8FGF-16/FGFR-1cNDaND, not detected.NDNDFGF-16/FGFR-2cNDNDNDFGF-16/FGFR-43.66 × 10−34.22 × 1050.86 × 10−8a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Wistar rats (8 weeks old) were kept at 4 °C (cold exposure) for 1 week. The expression of FGF-16mRNA and UCP-1 mRNA in the brown adipose tissue after 1 week of cold exposure was examined by Northern blotting analysis. The expression of UCP-1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue was greatly increased by cold exposure (Fig. 1). In contrast, the expression of FGF-16 mRNA was not increased but was rather decreased (Fig. 5). We also examined the expression of FGF-16 mRNA in brown adipose tissue after 1-, 4-, and 24-h cold exposure. The expression ofFGF-16 mRNA was also not increased (data not shown). FGF-16 was originally identified from rat heart by homology-based polymerase chain reaction (9.Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although FGF-16 lacks a typical signal sequence, it was efficiently secreted, indicating that FGF-16 is a secretory protein. FGF-16 mRNA was predominantly expressed in heart among adult tissues examined (9.Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The expression profile was quite distinct from those of other FGFmRNAs. In rat embryos at embryonic day 19.5, FGF-16mRNA was predominantly expressed in brown adipose tissue, indicating that FGF-16 plays a crucial role in embryonic brown adipose tissue (9.Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Brown adipose tissue is a specialized tissue of mammals responsible for facultative thermogenesis (1.Giralt M. Martin I. Iglesias R. Vinas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proliferation and differentiation of brown adipose tissue occurs during the embryonic period (1.Giralt M. Martin I. Iglesias R. Vinas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12.Danilenko D.M. Montestruque S. Philo J.S. Tiansheng L. Hill D. Speakman J. Bahru M. Zhang M. Konishi M. Itoh N. Chirica M. Delaney J. Hernday N. Martin F. Hara S. Talvenheimo J. Nahri L.O. Arakawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). UCP-1 is a marker-specific for brown adipose tissue differentiation. The expression of UCP-1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue was greatly induced from embryonic day 20 (1.Giralt M. Martin I. Iglesias R. Vinas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our present results ofUCP-1 mRNA expression are consistent with those reported (1.Giralt M. Martin I. Iglesias R. Vinas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These results indicate that differentiation of brown adipose tissue is greatly stimulated from embryonic day ∼20. In contrast,FGF-16 mRNA was significantly expressed at embryonic day 19.5. The expression was decreased as differentiation progressed and greatly decreased after birth. These results indicate that FGF-16 is not a factor involved in differentiation of brown adipose tissue. Cellular aggregation was noted in the fetal interscapular area at embryonic day 15, and primitive lobules of interscapular brown adipose tissue became unequivocally identifiable at embryonic day 17. Mitogenic activity in the brown adipose tissue anlage was maximal during embryonic days 17–19, and continued thereafter at lower levels into the neonatal period (11.Nnodim J.O. Lever J.D. Anat. Embryol. 1985; 173: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, we also examined the expression of FGF-16 mRNA in brown adipose tissue during these periods by in situ hybridization.FGF-16 mRNA was significantly expressed in most of the cells in brown adipose tissue at embryonic days 17.5, 18.5, and 19.5, and the expression gradually decreased along with brown adipose tissue differentiation as described above. The expression profile ofFGF-16 mRNA is closely related with mitogenic activity in brown adipose tissue reported (11.Nnodim J.O. Lever J.D. Anat. Embryol. 1985; 173: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). FGFs are local signaling molecules that act on proximal cells (3.Baird A. Klagsbrun M. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 239-243PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, FGF-16 in brown adipose tissues should act on proximal cells within the tissue. As FGF-16 mRNA was significantly expressed in brown adipose tissue at developmental stages when mitogenic activity in the brown adipose tissue anlage was maximal, we expected that FGF-16 was a mitogen for brown adipocytes. In the present paper, we examined the mitogenic activity of recombinant rat FGF-16 for primary rat brown adipocytes. FGF-16 showed significant mitogenic activity for primary rat brown adipocytes. FGFs bind and activate FGF receptors. Four FGF receptor genes, FGFR-1 to FGFR-4, have been identified. Three of them have alternative spliced variants. Seven FGF receptors, FGFR-1b, FGFR-1c, FGFR-2b, FGFR-2c, FGFR-3b, FGFR-3c, and FGFR-4, with different ligand specificities have been identified (19.Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Among them, only three FGF receptors, FGFR-1c, FGFR-2c, and FGFR-4, were expressed in rat embryonic brown adipose tissue. However, only FGFR-4 could bind FGF-16. These results indicate that FGF-16 exerts the mitogenic activity by binding and activating FGFR-4 in the brown adipose tissue. Cold exposure produces adaptive hyperplasia and growth of brown adipose tissue with an increase of several proteins specific for brown adipose tissue, such as UCP-1. The cellularity of brown adipose tissue (total tissue cell number) also greatly increases during cold acclimation. Radioautographic experiments using [3H]thymidine revealed that the mitogenic rate was maximal in brown adipose tissue during the first week of cold acclimation, declining thereafter (11.Nnodim J.O. Lever J.D. Anat. Embryol. 1985; 173: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression of UCP-1 mRNA andFGF-16 mRNA in adult rat brown adipose tissue during cold exposure. The expression of UCP-1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue was greatly increased by cold exposure. In contrast, the expression of FGF-16 mRNA was not increased, but rather decreased, indicating that FGF-16 is not involved in adaptive hyperplasia and growth of brown adipose tissue during cold exposure. Insulin-like growth factor-I was expressed in and induced the differentiation of embryonic brown adipose tissue, indicating that insulin-like growth factor-I is a growth factor involved in differentiation of embryonic adipose tissue (16.Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Alvarez A. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The proliferation and differentiation of brown adipose tissue during cold exposure are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (14.Himms-Hagen J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, the factors involved in the proliferation of embryonic brown adipose tissue have remained to be elucidated. The expression profile of FGF-16mRNA and the activity of recombinant FGF-16 reported here indicate that FGF-16 is a unique growth factor involved in proliferation of embryonic brown adipose tissue."

Here we compared the abilities of a series of symmetrically substituted phorbol 12,13-diesters to translocate PKC δ. In vitro, the derivatives bound to PKC with similar potencies but differed in rate of equilibration. In vivo, the phorbol diesters with short, intermediate, and long chain fatty acids induced distinct patterns of translocation. Phorbol 12,13–dioctanoate and phorbol 12,13-nonanoate, the intermediate derivatives and most potent tumor promoters, showed patterns of translocation typical of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, with plasma membrane and subsequent nuclear membrane translocation. The more hydrophilic compounds (phorbol 12,13–dibutyrate and phorbol 12,13–dihexanoate) induced a patchy distribution in the cytoplasm, more prominent nuclear membrane translocation, and little plasma membrane localization at all concentrations examined (100 nm to 10 μm). The highly lipophilic derivatives, phorbol 12,13–didecanoate and phorbol 12,13-diundecanoate, at 1 μm caused either plasma membrane translocation only or no translocation at incubation times up to 60 min. Our results indicate that lipophilicity of phorbol esters is a critical factor contributing to differential PKC δ localization and thereby potentially to their different biological activities.

Protein kinase C (PKC),1the primary target of the phorbol ester tumor promoters, consists of a family of 12 members that are classified into four subfamilies. The classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, γ) are Ca2+- and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG)-dependent, whereas the novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ) are Ca2+-independent but DAG-responsive. The atypical PKCs (ζ, λ/ι) lack the responses to both Ca2+ and DAG. The fourth subfamily (μ, ν) is most divergent in structure and function from all other PKC members but maintains the C1 domains in the regulatory region that bind DAG (1.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5757) Google Scholar, 2.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3534) Google Scholar, 3.Parker P.J. Dekker L.V.

The structural module in PKC that binds DAG and phorbol esters is a 50-amino acid-long lipid-interacting domain that coordinates two Zn2+ ions, termed a C1 domain (5.Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It is expressed in tandem in the regulatory regions of the classical, novel, and PKC μ subfamilies of PKCs (4.Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters and their derivatives bind the classical and novel PKCs with high affinities in vitro; their inhibitory equilibrium dissociation constants are in the lower nanomolar range (6.Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol derivatives with different lipophilicities exhibit different biological activities and potencies. It is known that high tumor promoting activity by phorbol derivatives requires an optimal length of fatty acid side chains. Phorbol 12,13-diC8 is most potent among the symmetrically substituted phorbol 12,13-diesters (25.Schmidt R. Hecker E. Hecker E. Fusenig N.E. Kunz W. Marks F. Thielmann H.W. Cocarcinogenesis and Biological Effects of Tumor Promoters. Raven Press, New York1982: 57-63Google Scholar), and the 12-myristoyl derivative shows the greatest potency among phorbol 12-acyl ester 13-acetate derivatives (7.Hecker E. Cancer Res. 1968; 28: 2338-2348PubMed Google Scholar). Among 12-deoxyphorbol 13-monoesters, the 13-tetradecanoate derivative displays potent tumor promoting activity (8.Zayed S. Sorg B. Hecker E. Planta Medica. 1984; 4: 65-69Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the 13-phenylacetate and 13-acetate derivatives actually inhibit tumor promotion (9.Szallasi Z. Krsmanovic L. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2507-2512PubMed Google Scholar). In in vitro studies, we have reported previously that highly lipophilic phorbol esters inhibit [3H]PDBu binding to cytosolic PKCs from mouse brain homogenate with different potencies when added to the aqueous or lipid phases (10.Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar); similar high potencies for the different derivatives were seen when applied in the lipid phase. Using a PKC δ fusion to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to visualize PKC δ dynamics in live cells, we reported recently that two 12-deoxyphorbol 13-monoesters, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, with similar high affinities for PKC but different lipophilicities, induced distinct patterns of translocation (11.Wang Q.J.

The promoting derivative 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate closely resembled PMA in its pattern of translocation, whereas the 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, which is antihyperplastic and antipromoting, caused punctate intracellular accumulation of δ-PKC-GFP as well as nuclear membrane localization (11.Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Distinct patterns of localization of PKC, by controlling its access to substrates, provide one mechanism driving distinct patterns of biological response to ligands. In the present study, we have focused on one type of phorbol esters, the symmetrically substituted phorbol 12,13-diesters, to systematically explore the influence of hydrophobicity on the dynamics of PKC δ localization in live cells. The effects of acyl ester chain length in these compounds on their inherent binding affinities and on their translocation of PKC δ fusion protein were studied. Our results indicated that the phorbol 12,13-diesters of different lipophilicities translocated PKC δ with distinct patterns and kinetics. PDBu and phorbol 12,13-diC10 were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (Pittsburgh, PA). Phorbol 12,13-diC6 was from LC Services Corp. (Woburn, MA). Phorbol 12,13-diC8, phorbol 12,13-diC9, and phorbol 12,13-diC11 were synthesized as described by Bresch et al. (12.Bresch H.M. Kreibich G. Kubinyi H. Schairer H.-U. Thielmann H.W. Hecker E. Z. Naturforsch. 1974; 23b: 538-546Google Scholar). Briefly, the phorbol 12,13,20-triesters were prepared from phorbol (LC Services) and the corresponding acid chlorides in the presence of pyridine. The phorbol 12,13,20-triesters were then converted to the phorbol 12,13-diesters by transesterification in methanol in the presence of perchloric acid. The compounds were purified by silica gel chromatography using hexane-ethyl acetate. The octanol/water partition coefficients (log P) were calculated according to the fragment-based program KOWIN 1.63 (Syracuse Research Corp.). CHO-K1 cells (CCL 61) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose, 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. This plasmid was prepared as described previously (11.Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, a plasmid pEGFP-N1 encoding the GFP was purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). AMluI restriction site was generated by inserting aMluI linker into the plasmid digested with SmaI. A mouse PKC δ cDNA fragment with XhoI andMluI sites was subcloned into the expression vector pEGFP-N1 with the GFP attached to the 3′ end of PKC δ. The junction of PKC δ and GFP in the constructed plasmid was verified by sequencing, which was performed by the DNA minicore, Division of Basic Sciences, NCI, National Institutes of Health. CHO-K1 cells were grown on 40-mm round coverslips (Bioptechs, Inc., Butler, PA) to 50–75% confluence. Transient transfection was conducted using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The fluorescence became detectable 24 h after transfection, and all experiments were performed 3 days after transfection. Prior to observation, transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells were washed twice with standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum) prewarmed to 37 °C. All PKC activators were diluted to the specified concentrations in the same medium, and the final concentration of solvent was always less than 0.01%. For live cell imaging, a Bioptechs Focht Chamber System (FCS2) was inverted and attached to the microscope stage with a custom stage adapter. The cells cultured on a 40-mm round coverslip were introduced into the chamber system, which was connected to a temperature controller set at 37 °C, and medium was perfused through the chamber with a model P720 microperfusion pump (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA). As indicated, the perfusate to the chamber was changed to that containing the specified ligand for PKC, and sequential images of the same cell were then collected at 1-min intervals using LaserSharp software through a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope with a 60× planapochromat lens. A krypton-argon gas laser provided excitation at 488 nm with a 522/32 emission filter for green fluorescence. [3H]PDBu binding to PKC δ was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed in our laboratory (10.Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Dissociation constants (K i) of ligands were determined by competition of [3H]PDBu binding to PKC δ. Recombinant PKC δ was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (13.Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture (250 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml 100% phosphatidylserine, 4 mg/ml bovine immunoglobulin G, [3H]PDBu, and variable concentrations of competing ligand. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min or 30 min. Samples were chilled to 0 °C for 10 min, 200 ml of 35% polyethylene glycol in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) was added, and the samples were incubated at 0 °C for an additional 15 min. The tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman 12 microcentrifuge at 4 °C (12,000 rpm, 15 min). A 100-μl aliquot of the supernatant was removed for the determination of the free concentration of [3H]PDBu, and the pellet was carefully dried. The tip of the centrifuge tube containing the pellet was cut off and transferred to a scintillation vial for the determination of the total bound [3H]PDBu. Aquasol was added both to aliquots of the supernatants and to the pellets, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was measured using an excess of nonradioactive PDBu (30 μm). Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. In a typical competition assay, 6–8 concentrations of the competing ligand were used, ID50 values were determined from the competition curve, and the K i for the competing ligand was calculated from its ID50 using the relationshipK i = ID50/(1 +L/K d), where L is the concentration of free [3H]PDBu and K dis the dissociation constant. For compounds directly applied to the aqueous phase, binding was conducted for 5 or 30 min at 37 °C as indicated. Compounds incorporated into the lipid phase were mixed with the phosphatidylserine in organic solvent, the solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the compound-phosphatidylserine mixture was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) as described (14.Kazanietz M.G. Krausz K.W. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20878-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding was then assayed using a 30-min incubation time at 37 °C. Values represent the mean of n experiments, as indicated, with triplicate determinations of each point in each competition curve in each experiment. The confocal images were processed and analyzed using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Fixed small, representative areas in the cytoplasm and nucleus as well as the plasma and nuclear membranes were selected, and the mean fluorescent intensities were determined. The extent of membrane translocation was calculated using the ratio of (I m −I cyto)/I cyto, whereI m represents the mean fluorescent intensity on the plasma or nuclear membrane in a given area, and Icytois the mean fluorescent intensity in a comparable area of the cytoplasm or the nucleoplasm, respectively. The fusion protein δ-PKC-GFP was characterized in our previous study (11.Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, δ-PKC-GFP could be transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells. It showed the expected molecular size on Western blots and was stable in the presence of ligand for the duration of the experiment. Similar observations have been made by others (15.Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the apparent potencies of the series of phorbol 12,13-diesters with fatty acid side chains varying in length from 4 to 11 carbon atoms for inhibiting [3H]PDBu binding to PKC δ. The lipophilicities of these compounds depend on the length of the fatty acid side chains. Their calculated octanol-water partition coefficients range from a log P value of 3.43 for PDBu (phorbol 12,13-diC4) to 10.31 for phorbol 12,13-diC11 (TableI). To ensure that the compounds were fully incorporated into the lipid phase, we prepared mixed liposomes of phosphatidylserine and ligand and incubated PKC δ for 30 min in the presence of these mixed liposomes to measure binding activity. The phorbol diesters from diC6 to diC11 inhibited [3H]PDBu binding with similar high affinities (Table I). The most hydrophilic compound in the series, phorbol 12,13-diC4, exhibited a modestly higherK i value than that of the others, presumably reflecting in part its release from the liposomes into the aqueous phase under our assay conditions.Table IThe apparent affinities (Ki) of phorbol 12,13-diesters for inhibition of [ 3 H]PDBu binding to PKC δLigandsLogPK i, lipid phase (30-min incubation)K i, aqueous phase30-min incubation5-min incubationnmnmPDBu3.432.40 ± 0.20 (3)1.50 ± 0.13 (3)1.38 ± 0.03 (3)Phorbol 12,13-DiC65.390.26 ± 0.03 (3)0.33 ± 0.05 (3)0.32 ± 0.03 (3)Phorbol 12,13-DiC87.360.21 ± 0.08 (3)0.28 ± 0.04 (4)1.28 ± 0.08 (3)Phorbol 12,13-DiC98.340.19 ± 0.05 (3)0.29 ± 0.02 (3)2.08 ± 0.38 (3)Phorbol 12,13-DiC109.320.41 ± 0.12 (5)0.73 ± 0.21 (5)3.81 ± 0.62 (3)Phorbol 12,13-DiC1110.310.54 ± 0.13 (5)4.62 ± 1.04 (7)15.93 ± 2.68 (3)Ki values of compounds added to the aqueous or lipid phase were determined with 5- or 30-min incubations at 37 °C as specified.

The number of experiments is indicated in parentheses. P, octanol/water partition coefficient. In biological experiments, ligands are added to the culture medium and must equilibrate with the cell membranes. PDBu and phorbol 12,13-diC6 are the most hydrophilic compounds and should equilibrate rapidly from the aqueous solution. However, compounds with long chain fatty acids, such as phorbol 12,13-diC10 and phorbol 12,13-diC11, dissolve poorly in aqueous solutions as reported (16.Jacobson K. Wenner C.E. Kemp G. Papahadjopoulos D. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 2991-2995PubMed Google Scholar) and are expected to equilibrate much more slowly from the aqueous solution. Therefore, we determined the apparent binding affinities of the phorbol diesters applied directly into the aqueous phase and assayed with 30- or 5-min times of incubation at 37 °C. As illustrated in Table I, a 30-min incubation time permitted complete equilibration of the diesters with chain lengths up to diC9 (log P = 8.34). The diC10 derivative showed 2-fold weaker apparent affinity than observed when the ligand was added directly to the lipid, and for the diC11 derivative this difference increased to 8.5-fold. If only a 5-min incubation time was used, then complete equilibration was only obtained for diesters with chain lengths up to diC6 (log P = 5.39). For diC11, the apparent affinity was 30-fold weaker than that obtained for the ligand added directly to the lipid. Reflecting that the measurements were not being made under equilibrium conditions, the apparent K i values for phorbol 12,13-diC10 and phorbol 12,13-diC11 showed greater variability when added to the aqueous phase. Based on the in vitro binding analysis, we used similar single doses of phorbol 12,13-diesters to induce the translocation of δ-PKC-GFP (Fig. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Distinctive patterns of translocation were observed for phorbol 12, 13-diesters with short, intermediate, and long chain fatty acids.Figure 1PDBu at 1 μm induced translocation of δ-PKC-GFP expressed in CHO-K1 cells.Fluorescent images of CHO cells expressing δ-PKC-GFP after 0-, 5-, 10-, or 20-min treatment of 1 μm PDBu.

Both sites of translocation were apparent very rapidly after ligand addition (1–2 min), and the translocation appeared complete within 5–10 min. The nuclear translocation by PDBu at 1 μm was less extensive compared with that by phorbol 12,13-diC6. Higher concentrations (10 μm) of PDBu gave similar results. After a 20-min treatment with PDBu, small portions of δ-GFP-PKC located to the plasma membrane in some cells examined. Phorbol 12,13-diC6 induced some plasma membrane translocation in the majority of cells coincident with the nuclear membrane translocation; this plasma membrane translocation peaked at 10–20 min and gradually disappeared (data not shown). The degree and timing of nuclear translocation induced by 1 μm PDBu and phorbol 12,13-diC6 were quantitated as shown in Fig.3 A. For both ligands, translocation peaked at 10 min, although the degree of translocation caused by phorbol 12,13-diC6 was 4-fold higher compared with that by PDBu. The pattern of this nuclear translocation appeared more transient compared with that of phorbol 12,13-diC8 and phorbol 12,13-diC9 (Fig.3 B). The translocation of δ-PKC-GFP induced by phorbol 12,13-diesters with fatty acid side chains of intermediate length, viz. phorbol 12,13-diC8 and phorbol 12,13-diC9, bore great resemblance to that of PMA, as described previously (11.Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, both phorbol 12,13-diC8 and phorbol 12,13-diC9 (1 μm) generated rapid plasma membrane translocation that peaked at 5 and 10 min, respectively, followed by slower but more extensive nuclear membrane translocation. Between 10 and 20 min, nuclear membrane translocation exceeded the level of translocation to the plasma membrane and continued to rise, while the level of plasma membrane translocation decreased. The kinetics of translocation by phorbol 12,13-diC8 are most comparable with that of PMA (log P= 7.36), in agreement with their similar lipophilicities (Fig. 6). Phorbol 12,13-diesters with long chain fatty acids, phorbol 12,13-diC10 and phorbol 12,13-diC11, showed weak activity in translocating δ-PKC-GFP (Fig. 7 and8). At 1 μm, phorbol 12,13-diC10 caused only plasma membrane translocation visible after 20 min of treatment, while no apparent nuclear membrane translocation was observed even after 45 min of treatment. A 10-fold higher concentration gave a response resembling that of 1 μm phorbol 12,13-diC9. Phorbol 12,13-diC11 failed to translocate δ-PKC-GFP at 1 μm even after 60 min of treatment. Higher concentrations of phorbol 12,13-diC11 (10 and 100 μm) gave weak responses (Fig. 9). Concentrations higher than 100 μm generated signs of cytotoxicity (data not shown). A potential factor contributing to the isozyme- and ligand-specific activities of PKC is their distinct patterns of subcellular localization. The differential localization of various PKC isoforms in live cells in real time has been reported using GFP fused to PKC (15.Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Distinctive patterns of translocation of GFP-tagged PKC δ have been reported in response to treatment with ATP, PMA, and H2O2 in CHO-K1 cells (15.Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saito and collaborators have shown that fatty acids as co-activators affect the translocation of PKC-γ and -ε differently (19.Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Anchoring proteins, RICKs, RACKs, and PICKs, that interact with the inactive and activated PKCs at different subcellular locations have been identified and characterized (20.Mochly-Rosen D. Henrich C.J. Cheever L. Khaner H. Simpson P.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1990; 1: 693-706Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 21.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S.

Stevens J.L. Jaken S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 793-798PubMed Google Scholar) and provide a mechanism for cell type-specific control of localization. In our previous studies, we had described a series of phorbol esters and related compounds with different patterns of biological response that target a GFP fusion protein of PKC δ to different subcellular locations inside the cell. The interaction of phorbol esters with the C1 domain of PKC involves insertion into the hydrophilic cleft within the C1 domain by the hydrophilic head group of the phorbol esters, hydrophobic interaction with the rim of the cleft, and the further hydrophobic interaction between the fatty acid side chains of phorbol esters and the lipid bilayer or proteins associated with it (5.Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 24.Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In the present study, the effect of the latter hydrophobic interaction on the translocation of PKC was addressed. By maintaining the phorbol ester pharmacophore while varying the lipophilicity with different lengths of fatty acid side chains in the phorbol 12,13-diesters, we are able to show that lipophilicity of ligands plays a critical role in the targeting of PKC in live cells. The GFP fusion protein of PKC δ transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells was shown to be intact and stable and behave as native PKC δ (11.Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,15.Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better characterize the in vitro pharmacology of the phorbol 12,13-diesters, we tested the binding properties of phorbol 12,13-diesters directly incorporated into the lipid phase or added to the aqueous phase and evaluated at different times of incubation. Phorbol 12,13-diC6 to phorbol 12,13-diC11 showed the same high inherent binding affinities of 0.2–0.3 nm when incorporated into the lipid phase, in contrast to a 50-fold difference when added in the aqueous phase and evaluated after only a 5-min incubation time. Our results indicated that the length of the fatty acid side chains had little effect on the affinity of the phorbol diesters under these assay conditions, although the change of lipophilicity significantly affected its kinetics of interaction with PKC. The more lipophilic the compound was, the longer it needed to equilibrate. The K i for PDBu in our study gave modestly lower affinity than expected (K d = 0.75 nm). The data are consistent with our previous analysis of even more lipophilic phorbol diesters (10.Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, phorbol 12,13-diC10 was shown to equilibrate within 30 min, whereas phorbol 12,13-dioleate, for example, showed a 3000-fold weaker potency when added to the aqueous phase rather than the lipid phase. For the pattern of translocation of PKC δ in response to phorbol diesters differing only in lipophilicity, our core finding is that hydrophilic derivatives caused PKC δ to translocate differently in the cell than did the more hydrophobic derivatives. The hydrophilic derivatives caused reduced plasma membrane translocation and accumulation of PKC δ with a patchy cytoplasmic distribution, as well as the nuclear membrane distribution common to both these derivatives and the more hydrophobic ones. These studies thus begin to reveal differential structural requirements for ligand-driven translocation of PKC δ to different membrane compartments. Our results are consistent with our recently reported observation for a pair of 12-deoxyphorbol 13-monoesters, which likewise differed in lipophilicity, although they were not fully homologous (11.Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Whereas 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate (log P = 7.89) translocated PKC δ with a pattern similar to PMA (log P = 7.36), the more hydrophilic derivative 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate (logP = 3.45), like phorbol 12,13-diC4 (logP = 3.43), caused patchy cytoplasmic distribution together with nuclear membrane localization. A prediction from the localization studies is that the differential pattern of localization should translate into differential access to substrates and different biology. Limited evidence from the literature supports different biology for more hydrophilic derivatives. The most dramatic example is that 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate is an inhibitor of tumor promotion, whereas 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate is a complete tumor promoter (9.Szallasi Z. Krsmanovic L. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2507-2512PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Schmidt and Hecker had likewise reported that phorbol 12,13-diacetate, -dipropionate, or -diC4 inhibited promotion by PMA when coapplied (25.Schmidt R. Hecker E. Hecker E. Fusenig N.E. Kunz W. Marks F. Thielmann H.W. Cocarcinogenesis and Biological Effects of Tumor Promoters. Raven Press, New York1982: 57-63Google Scholar). As another example, phorbol 12,13-diC4 was only 5.6-fold less potent than the diC8 derivative for mouse ear inflammation but was 53-fold less potent for tumor promotion (26.Thielmann H.W. Hecker E. Schmidt G.C. Fortschritte der Krebsforschung. Schattauer, Stuttgart1969: 171-179Google Scholar). On the other hand, the structural activity for stimulation of deoxyglucose uptake in chick embryo fibroblasts and binding affinity showed good agreement over a broad range of lipophilicities (27.Driedger P.E. Blumberg P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Obviously, interpretation of complex responses is clouded by the potential role of pharmacokinetics. In addition, different PKC isoforms show different patterns of localization and different ligand dependence for their localization. PKC β1, for example, translocates to the plasma membrane with all derivatives examined. 2Q. J. Wang and P. M. Blumberg, unpublished observations. Responses coupled to PKC β would thus be expected to show different ligand dependence from those coupled to PKC δ. In any case, our current findings argue that this area deserves close examination. A second, not unexpected finding of our studies is that the kinetics of PKC δ translocation in response to ligands is dependent on their lipophilicity. Murphy et al. (28.Murphy T.V. Prountzos C. Kotsonis P. Iannazzo L. Majewski H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) recently showed that the binding of PDBu was similar in intact synaptosomes and in synaptosomal membranes, whereas the rate of binding of PMA in the intact synaptosomes was slower than in the membranes, suggesting that lipophilicity slowed the rate of penetration through the membrane. They further correlated the kinetics with the biology of noradrenaline release. Our results directly demonstrate that the more lipophilic derivatives required longer to induce nuclear translocation. Since the hydrophilic derivatives did not induce plasma membrane translocation consistently, the kinetics of translocation to this site could not be compared. For responses that desensitize rapidly, different rates of onset of a response could be reflected in different absolute extents of response before desensitization. For the highly lipophilic derivatives, we did not explore very long times of incubation because we were concerned that interpretation would be clouded by possible hydrolysis of the compounds to the more hydrophilic 13-monoesters. Comparison of binding activity to PKC and translocation by the symmetrically substituted phorbol 12,13-diesters with their tumor promoting activity (26.Thielmann H.W. Hecker E. Schmidt G.C. Fortschritte der Krebsforschung. Schattauer, Stuttgart1969: 171-179Google Scholar) shows substantial correspondence (Fig.10). The loss of tumor promoting activity at longer chain lengths occurs as the compounds become unable to rapidly equilibrate in aqueous solution. The loss of tumor promoting ability at short chain lengths is reflected in the decreased intrinsic affinity for ligand added directly to the lipid phase. The kinetics of plasma membrane translocation approximately parallel the relative potencies for tumor promotion. Because of its central role in signal transduction, PKC has been an attractive target for drug development, both for cancer chemotherapy and for other applications. Bryostatin 1, a natural product that interacts with the C1 domain, is currently in phase II clinical trials for melanoma, multiple myeloma, renal cell carcinoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (29.Lilly M. Brown C. Pettit G. Kraft A. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 283-287PubMed Google Scholar). LY333531, a PKC β-selective kinase inhibitor, is currently in clinical trials for vascular proliferation in the retina and kidney associated with diabetes (30.Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F. Stramm L.E. Feener E.P. King G.L. Science. 1996; 272: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 31.Ishii H. Koya D. King G.L. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Design of drugs with maximal selectivity for a specific PKC pathway remains a major objective. For ligands targeted to the regulatory domain, the cellular context in which PKC is found has emerged as a dramatic determinant of specificity. Thus, differences of 2 orders of magnitude in isotype selectivity were found between in vitro binding assays and translocation in cultured cells (32.Kazanietz M.g. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Szallasi Z. Kosa K. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Yuspa S.H. Blumberg P.M. Mol.

Similarly, marked differences in selectivity for PKC translocation were found between different cell types (35.Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies assessed translocation in terms of a shift for the cytosol to the particulate fraction. Our current findings demonstrate further opportunity for selectivity, by controlling the specific site to which PKC is translocated."

Based on studies with the bacterial prototypes, GroEL (cpn60) and GroES (cpn10), it appears that chaperonins facilitate protein folding principally by preventing (8.Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T.

The chloroplast chaperonin 60 (ch-cpn60) was initially identified as an abundant oligomeric protein that transiently binds the nascent large subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) prior to their assembly into the Rubisco holoenzyme (18.Barraclough R. Ellis R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 608: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It was subsequently demonstrated that the transfer of Rubisco large subunits from the binary complex to the Rubisco holoenzyme requires MgATP (19.Milos P. Roy H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and that this process is specifically inhibited by antibodies against the ch-cpn60 (20.Cannon S. Wang P. Roy H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While the exact mechanism has not been determined, the available evidence suggests the GroEL homolog of chloroplasts is an obligatory molecular chaperone in the folding/assembly pathway of the higher plant Rubisco (reviewed in Refs. 21.Roy H. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22.Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Gatenby A.A.

Biol. 1996; 32: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). More recent experiments with the purified ch-cpn60 have demonstrated that this protein can also assist in the folding of other proteins, through a process that requires both ATP hydrolysis and the participation of cpn10 (25.Viitanen P.V.

Like other GroEL homologs, the ch-cpn60 consists of two stacked heptameric rings with 7-fold rotational symmetry (26.Pushkin A. Tsuprun V. Solojeva N. Shubin V. Evstigneeva Z. Kretovich W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 379-384Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to bacteria and mitochondria, purified preparations of the native chloroplast protein contain two divergent subunits, α and β (27.Hemmingsen S.M. Ellis R.J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), that are no more similar to each other than they are to GroEL (29.Martel R. Cloney L.P. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The subunit composition and structural organization of ch-cpn60 tetradecamers has not been determined experimentally. Possible organizations of the mixed oligomer include: (a) a single species consisting of one ring of α subunits and one ring of β subunits; (b) an equal mixture of α 14-mers and β 14-mers; and/or (c) an ensemble of unrestricted hetero-oligomers of the general formula αxβ14-x. Perhaps the best evidence that both isoforms reside in the same molecule, is the observation that α subunits fail to assemble into 14-mers in Escherichia coliunless they are co-expressed with β subunits (30.Cloney L.P. Wu H.B. Hemmingsen S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23327-23332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Cloney L.P. Bekkaoui D.R. Wood M.G. Hemmingsen S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23333-23336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of these experiments is not straightforward since the recombinant α and β subunits both formed “mixed” tetradecamers with the endogenous GroEL of the bacterial host. The chloroplast cpn10 (ch-cpn10) represents an even greater departure from bacteria and mitochondria. Its subunit is nearly twice the size of other known cpn10s (∼21 kDa), and consists of two complete GroES-like peptides that are fused head-to-tail through a short intervening linker (6.Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both “halves” of the molecule are highly conserved at a number of residues that are thought to be important for cpn10 function (6.Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and each contains a “mobile loop” region analogous to that of GroES (32.Koonin E.V. van der Vies S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 14-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite these peculiarities, the ch-cpn10 forms oligomeric rings that resemble GroES in the electron microscope (33.Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and is functionally interchangeable with the latter by a number of criteria, including the ability to assist GroEL during protein folding (6.Bertsch U.

Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). That both domains of the ch-cpn10 can rescue GroES-deficient mutants when expressed individually in E. coli (33.Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) supports our initial hypothesis that they are both active in the intact molecule, and may perform different functions that are somehow related to the two ch-cpn60 isoforms. Contrary to this expectation, however, the binary ch-cpn10 is not an obligate partner for the ch-cpn60, at least in vitro. During folding experiments with two different protein substrates, both GroES and mouse mt-cpn10 could effectively take its place (25.Viitanen P.V. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Suzuki T. Vierling E. Dickson R. Lorimer G.H. Gatenby A. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18158-18164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although certain bacteria and mitochondria also possess multiple genes for cpn60 (24.Boston R.S. Viitanen P.V. Vierling E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 34.Lehel C. Los D. Wada H. Gyorgyei J. Horvath I. Kovacs E. Murata N. Vigh L. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 209: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), apart from plastids there are no reports of purified cpn60 14-mers that contain two divergent subunits. Likewise, immunological studies indicate that the double domain cpn10 is restricted to photosynthetic eucaryotes (25.Viitanen P.V. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Suzuki T. Vierling E. Dickson R. Lorimer G.H. Gatenby A. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18158-18164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33.Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A.

Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) it is sometimes assumed that cpn60s have little specificity for their protein substrates. Consequently, the possibility that the chaperonins of a particular organism or organelle have evolved in response to the proteins that they normally encounter has largely been ignored. However, the “double” nature of bothchloroplast chaperonin components, cpn60 and cpn10, could reflect a selective pressure. Perhaps one of the ch-cpn60 isoforms preferentially interacts with the higher plant Rubisco or some other chloroplast protein(s) that requires “special” folding assistance (cf. Ref. 37.Chen G.G. Jagendorf A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11497-11501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have cloned and overexpressed the α and β isoforms of the ch-cpn60 of pea (Pissum sativum)2, and subjected them to in vitroreconstitution experiments, alone and in combination with each other. Starting from the purified monomeric subunits, we show that it is possible to generate two different types of tetradecamers. One of these, like the authentic chloroplast protein, contains a mixture of α and β subunits, while the other consists solely of β subunits. The formation of both types of particles requires adenine nucleotides. Although β protomers can assemble into tetradecamers in the absence of α subunits, in the presence of the latter they are preferentially incorporated into α/β 14-mers. In contrast, the purified α protomers remain monomeric in the absence of β subunits. Reconstituted α/β 14-mers and β 14-mers can both assist in protein folding under non-permissive conditions. However, they do so with different efficiencies and requirements for cpn10. Taken together, our results suggest that α/β 14-mers are the predominant speciesin vivo and provide strong support for the notion that the two ch-cpn60 isoforms are functionally, as well as structurally, divergent. [14C]Carbonate was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. MgATP, ADP, AMP-PCP, and AMP-PNP were from Sigma. ATPγS was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The purification of GroES and the dimeric Rubisco of Rhodospirillum rubrum have been described (12.Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant spinach ch-cpn10 and mouse mt-cpn10 were purified and quantitated as described in Ref. 38.Viitanen P.V. Bacot K. Dickson R. Webb T. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar. All protein concentrations in the text refer to subunit molecular masses. A λgt10 cDNA library from pea was screened by hybridization, using restriction fragments from the genes that encode the α and β isoforms of the Brassica napus ch-cpn60 (GenBank accession numbers M35599 and M35600, respectively). The probes, consisting of nucleotides 32–844 of the α subunit and nucleotides 460–1017 of the β subunit, were labeled with the Genius 2 Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's protocol.EcoRI inserts from positive clones exhibiting strong hybridization signals were subcloned into the plasmid Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene), and partially sequenced using custom-designed primers and either Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp) or the Vent Sequencing Kit (New England BioLabs). Through this approach, cDNA inserts encoding the full-length α and β ch-cpn60 precursors were eventually identified and their complete nucleotide sequences were determined. To conserve journal space, the DNA sequences of these proteins are not presented, but they are available in the GenBank/EMBL Data Bank. For expression in E. coli, the chloroplast targeting sequences of the α and β ch-cpn60 precursors (28.Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were removed and the modified genes were cloned behind the T7 promoter. For the β subunit, which has a naturally occurring NcoI site at the start of the mature protein, this entailed a 3-way ligation reaction mixture that contained a 1.5-kilobase NcoI/PstI β gene fragment (nucleotides 265–1747), a 0.4-kilobasePstI/EcoRI β gene fragment (nucleotides 1748–2157), and NcoI/EcoRI-digested pET24d(+) (Novagen). The resulting construct, pβCHEL, encodes the mature β ch-cpn60 (28.Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with an initiator Met at its N terminus. On the other hand, two polymerase chain reaction primers were used to remove the targeting sequence from the α ch-cpn60 precursor. Primer 1 (5′-CCTACCGCAACATATGGCCGCTAAAGATATCGCC-3′), which hybridizes to nucleotides 172–189 of the α gene insert, introduced an NdeI site and initiator Met residue at the transit peptide cleavage site (28.Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Primer 2, (5′-CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCC-3′), which hybridizes to the Bluescript KS+ vector, provided a BamHI site just downstream from the protein's stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was cut with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into similarly digested pET24a(+) (Novagen). The resulting construct, pαCHEL, encodes the mature α ch-cpn60 (28.Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with an initiator Met at its N terminus. E. coli BL21(DE3), transformed with pαCHEL or pβCHEL, were grown and induced for protein expression as described in Ref. 39.Dickson R. Larsen B. Viitanen P.V. Tormey M.B. Geske J. Strange R. Bemis L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26858-26864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Unless stated otherwise, subsequent steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2.5–3.5 volumes of 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and passed twice through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Debris was removed by centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 40 min), and the supernatant was carefully removed and incubated for 2 h on ice to promote the dissociation of ch-cpn60 oligomers (see below). Glycerol was then added to 5% and the cell-free extract was stored at −80 °C for subsequent use; the protein concentration of the latter was ∼25–35 mg/ml. In the next step, the cell-free extract was rapidly thawed, diluted with an equal volume of water, and passed through a 0.2-μm Acrodisc filter (Gelman Sciences, catalog number 4192). Aliquots of the filtrate (∼170 mg of total protein) were then applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium sulfite (Buffer A). The column was developed at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (25 °C) with a linear gradient (85 ml) of 0–0.35 m NaCl (in Buffer A). Fractions eluting between ∼195 and 225 mm NaCl (α ch-cpn60) or ∼66–100 mm NaCl (β ch-cpn60) were pooled, supplemented with 2.5 mm dithiothreitol and 5% glycerol, and concentrated to ∼25 mg of protein/ml at 0 °C. Aliquots of the above material (∼25 mg of total protein) were then applied to a 21.5 × 600-mm TSK G3000SW gel filtration column (TosoHaas), pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl. The column was developed at 4 ml/min (25 °C), and fractions eluting between 30 and 32 min were pooled, supplemented with 5% glycerol, concentrated to ∼40 mg of protein/ml, and stored at −80 °C for subsequent use in reconstitution experiments. As shown below, the recombinant proteins that emerge from the gel filtration column at this position are largely monomeric, and henceforth are referred to as α and β protomers. 2It should be noted that at least some of the β ch-cpn60 is incorporated into 14-mers during expression in E. coli, and that a variable portion of these do survive gel filtration on the preparative gel filtration column (e.g. in elute in the columns void volume between 18.5 and 20 min). However, when cell-free extracts are incubated for 2 h at 0 °C with 10 mm EDTA, nearly complete conversion to the lower molecular weight species occurs. The final yields of purified, monomeric α and β ch-cpn60 were ∼6 and ∼4% of the total protein present in the cell-free extracts, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined as in Ref. 40.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Edman degradation of the purified recombinant proteins revealed that their initiator Met residues are removed inE. coli to yield the authentic mature α and β subunits (28.Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All reconstitution reactions were conducted at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 16 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer B); other additions are noted in the legends to tables and figures. Reconstituted 14-mers were isolated by gel filtration chromatography using a 7.5 × 300-mm TSK G3000SW column (TosoHaas); the maximum volume injected was 100 μl. The column was developed at 1.0 ml/min (25 °C) with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (Buffer C), and absorption at 225 nm (or 280 nm) was monitored. The extent of reconstitution was quantitated by measuring the area under the peak corresponding to where authentic ch-cpn6014 elutes (cf. Fig. 2 B), and comparing it to appropriate standards. For electron microscopy, ch-cpn60 tetradecamers were diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 to 0.2 mg of protein/ml, and negatively stained with 2.5% uranyl acetate. Micrographs were recorded at a nominal magnification of 60,000 with a Philips EM420 operated at 100 kV. Chaperonin-assisted folding reactions, and Rubisco assays were essentially as described (12.Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Viitanen P.V. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Suzuki T. Vierling E. Dickson R. Lorimer G.H. Gatenby A. Soll J. J. Biol.

Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, according to the method of Laemmli (41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we have cloned the full-length precursors for the α and β subunits of the pea ch-cpn60 and overexpressed them individually in E. coli without their chloroplast transit peptides. Similar to other plant species (24.Boston R.S. Viitanen P.V. Vierling E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 29.Martel R. Cloney L.P. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the two isoforms are highly divergent and share only ∼50% identity at the primary amino acid sequence level. Thus, they are no more similar to each other than they are to GroEL. As shown in Fig. 1, the α and β subunits are both well expressed in E. coli, and during SDS-PAGE exhibit protomer molecular masses that are typical of other cpn60 homologs (e.g. ∼55–60 kDa). Preliminary gel filtration experiments with crude cell-free extracts, prepared in the absence of EDTA, revealed that recombinant α ch-cpn60 was principally monomeric. In contrast, under identical conditions, recombinant β ch-cpn60 was extremely heterogeneous with respect to size, and eluted during gel filtration as a mixture of species, ranging from monomers to tetradecamers. Moreover, the size distribution was not constant and varied from one preparation to the next. Further complicating the purification of this protein, the various oligomeric species did not behave in a uniform manner during subsequent chromatography steps. Fortunately, it was discovered that recombinant β ch-cpn60 could be converted to a more uniform population of lower molecular weight species simply by treating the cell-free extract with 10 mm EDTA at 0 °C, a strategy that greatly facilitated its purification. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the purified α subunits elute as a sharp peak during gel filtration with an average molecular mass of ∼70 kDa, suggesting that the predominant species is probably a monomer. Similar results were obtained with the purified β subunits, although in this case, trace amounts of larger species were occasionally observed as a shoulder preceding the main peak. Nevertheless, it is important to note that none of the β subunits elute in the columns void volume (4.6–5.3 min), the position where GroEL and authentic ch-cpn60 14-mers would appear. For thein vitro reconstitution experiments described below, the purified recombinant α and β subunits following EDTA treatment and the preparative gel filtration step are simply referred to as protomers. It has previously been reported that urea-dissociated cpn60 tetradecamers can partially reassemble into 14-mers upon removal of the chaotrope (42.Lissin N.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Girshovich A.S. Nature. 1990; 348: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 43.Lissin N.M. Hemmingsen S.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 44.Lissin N.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mg2+ ions and adenine nucleotides are both required for this reaction, and, although not accurately quantified, the extent of reconstitution depends on the initial protein concentration. However, in those studies involving the ch-cpn60, the subunit composition of the reconstituted 14-mers was not explored, nor was it determined if the reassembly of particles requires the presence of both ch-cpn60 isoforms. To gain a better understanding of the oligomerization reaction, we subjected the purified α and β subunits to in vitro reconstitution experiments. Regardless of protomer concentration, neither subunit alone (Fig.3) nor in combination (not shown), spontaneously assembled in the absence of adenine nucleotide. More important, MgATP had no effect on the oligomeric state of the purified α subunits (Fig. 2 B), which remained monomeric even at protomer concentrations as high as 350 μm (Fig. 3, ●). To put this in perspective, it has been estimated that the concentration of cpn60 in the chloroplast stroma is ∼10 mg of protein/ml (28.Musgrove J.E. Johnson R.A. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), corresponding to about 90 μm of each of the two isoforms (based on protomer). Thus, the purified recombinant α subunits were unable to form stable 7-mers or 14-mers at protomer concentrations that are much greater than physiological. In contrast, the purified β subunits readily assembled into tetradecamers when provided with MgATP (Fig. 2B), and as expected, these eluted in the void volume of the gel filtration column.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2.Sollner Webb B. Mougey E.B. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 58-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The 5.8, 18, and 28 S rRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase I in the nucleolus, whereas, in contrast, 5 S rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III in the nucleoplasm. The ribosomal proteins are encoded by mRNAs that are synthesized by RNA polymerase II. After translation, these proteins are imported from the cytoplasm into the nucleolus for assembly of the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits. These, in turn, are then exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, multiple intracellular transport activities between the nucleus and cytoplasm are required for de novo ribosome synthesis.In eukaryotic cells, the 5 S rRNA is part of the 60 S ribosomal subunit. In addition, a significant amount of 5 S rRNA is complexed with various proteins to form nonribosome-associated ribonucleoprotein particles. After transcription, 5 S rRNA is able to transiently bind the La antigen, a 50-kDa protein that acts in the termination of polymerase III transcripts, in the nucleus (3.Rinke J. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1982; 29: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4.Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the nucleus, 5 S rRNA also binds either its own transcription factor IIIA or ribosomal protein L5, forming 7 or 5 S ribonucleoprotein particles, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 5.Pieler T. Rudt F. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been suggested that the 5 S rRNA·L5 complex (5 S ribonucleoprotein particle) acts as a precursor to ribosome assembly by delivering 5 S rRNA from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolar assembly site of 60 S ribosomal subunits (6.Steitz J.A. Berg C. Hendrick J.P. La Branche-Chabot H. Metspalu A. Rinke J. Yario T. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Studies in Xenopus oocytes have shown that 5 S rRNA can be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for subsequent accumulation at distinct cytoplasmic storage sites by either transcription factor IIIA or L5 (7.Guddat U.

Biol. 1995; 168: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As a consequence of increased ribosomal subunit synthesis, stored 5 S rRNA must be reimported from the cytoplasm into the oocyte nucleus. In contrast to nuclear export, however, the nuclear import of 5 S rRNA appears to be exclusively mediated by L5 protein (9.Allison L.A. Romaniuk P.J. Bakken A.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 129-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10.Rudt F. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11.Murdoch K.J. Allison L.A. Exp.

Although cytoplasmic storage sites for 5 S rRNA have not been observed in mammalian cells, the data so far raised in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that L5 protein is an intracellular 5 S rRNA transport factor.In addition to its 5 S rRNA transport activity, L5 has also been shown to bind to other cellular proteins that participate in various intracellular transport pathways. For example, L5 interacts with the Mdm2 oncoprotein (12.Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Piette J. Nicolas J.-C. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Mdm2 is an inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product that, upon binding to it, promotes the degradation of p53 via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (13.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar, 14.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar). Importantly, Mdm2 has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm of mammalian cells, and Mdm2-mediated nuclear export of p53 has been suggested to lead to p53 degradation (15.Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 16.Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Furthermore, L5 has been shown to bind to eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (17.Schatz O. Oft M. Dascher C. Schebesta M. Rosorius O. Jaksche H. Dobrovnik M. Bevec D. Hauber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is a critical cellular cofactor of the Rev trans-activator of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 (18.Ruhl M.

Rev is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein that is required for the nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely spliced HIV-1 mRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 20.Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Interestingly, competition experiments inXenopus oocytes have previously demonstrated that the nuclear export pathways for Rev and 5 S rRNA share common components (21.Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lührmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that L5 protein may play a role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, in addition to its role in 5 S rRNA transport.The purpose of this study was to characterize in detail the regions of ribosomal protein L5 that are required for intracellular trafficking, subcellular localization, and 5 S rRNA interaction.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have investigated the domain organization of ribosomal protein L5. L5 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein that is involved in the intracellular transport of 5 S rRNA (6.Steitz J.A. Berg C. Hendrick J.P. La Branche-Chabot H. Metspalu A. Rinke J. Yario T. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7.Guddat U. Bakken A.H. Pieler T.

This transport activity requires the interaction of L5 with nuclear import and export factors. However, the regions in L5 that mediate these protein-protein interactions, as well as the region required for 5 S rRNA binding, have to date been poorly defined. In fact, evidence for a distinct domain organization in mammalian L5 originated from a previous study in which the domain structure of the L5 protein from rat was investigated (29.Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11571-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this work, it was shown that the L5 amino terminus (aa 1–93) contains a 5 S rRNA binding domain and that the carboxyl terminus (aa 151–296) harbors a signal that targets L5 to the nucleus/nucleolus.By investigating the subcellular localization of L5 fusion proteins in living as well as in fixed cells, we were able to map two independent regions that serve as nuclear/nucleolar targeting signals. The region located in the L5 amino terminus maps to amino acid residues at position 21–37 (depicted in Fig.8 A). Fusion of a corresponding amino acid sequence to otherwise cytoplasmic βGal resulted in nuclear accumulation of the respective fusion protein. Because the βGal reporter protein is not suitable to investigate L5 signals that confer nucleolar localization (29.Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11571-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we also fused this L5 sequence to GFP. This resulted in nucleolar accumulation of the respective L5-GFP fusion protein, whereas, in contrast, no nucleolar localization was detected when wild-type GFP was expressed (28.Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The combined data indicated that this amino-terminal region in L5 serves as both a strong nuclear localization and nucleolar targeting signal. A second region that is involved in directing L5 to specific subcellular compartments is located in the protein carboxyl terminus and maps to amino acid position 255–265 (Fig. 8 A). As with the amino-terminal signal, this region mediates the nucleolar localization of GFP. In contrast, this signal failed to target the ∼116-kDa βGal protein to the nucleus. Fusion of the carboxyl-terminal half of L5 (aa 150–297) to βGal, however, resulted in nuclear steady-state accumulation of this fusion protein. Subsequently, the microinjection of GST-GFP fusion proteins into the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of Vero cells revealed that the complete L5 carboxyl terminus (aa 255–297) is able to mediate nuclear import as well as nucleolar accumulation. However, the kinetic with which the respective GST-L5-GFP fusion protein translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was slow when compared with the kinetic of the NLS found within the SV40 large T-antigen in this type of experiment (data not shown). In fact, significant nuclear import of cytoplasmic GST-L5–255/297-GFP hybrid protein was observed ∼45 min postinjection, whereas, in contrast, the translocation of a similar GST-SV40 NLS-GFP construct was complete after ∼10 min. Thus, the L5 carboxyl terminus (aa 255–297) exerts weak nuclear import activity when compared with a classical NLS. Moreover, the sequence located between L5 aa positions 255 and 265 appears to be required, although not sufficient, to direct a heterologous protein into the nucleus. Note that the amino acid composition of this L5 region resembles loosely the NLS found within the SV40 large T-antigen. This prototypic NLS is characterized by a short peptide motif highly enriched with positively charged amino acids (40.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NLS located in the L5 amino terminus (aa 21–37) resembles a bipartite NLS of the type originally identified in nucleoplasmin. This type of signal is defined by two basic peptide regions that are separated by a spacer region of ∼10 amino acid residues (40.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). With respect to nuclear import it is also important to note that the L5 protein appears to form homodimers. Because the regions responsible for dimerization are not known, we cannot rule out the possibility that nuclear import of some reporter constructs may have occurred due to dimerization of the respective L5 fusion proteins with endogenous wild-type L5 protein.To date, no clear consensus sequence has been reached on what directs nuclear proteins to the nucleolus. Delineation of the sequence requirements for subcellular localization of chicken nucleolin has revealed that the RNA binding motifs in nucleolin also cause its accumulation in the nucleoli (41.Schmidt Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that nucleolin is not transported actively into the nucleoli but rather is retained in this specific subnuclear compartment as a result of its interaction with rRNA. In this study, analysis of the 5 S rRNA binding phenotypes using RNA gel retardation analyses demonstrated that the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions, which encompass the signals required for nuclear and nucleolar localization of L5 (aa 1–38 and 252–297), are necessary for 5 S rRNA binding. Obviously, these regions are characterized by a high number of basic residues that may contribute to RNA binding. In summary, it appears that binding of L5 to 5 S rRNA correlates with its ability to accumulate in the nucleoli. Thus, targeting of L5 to the nucleoli seems to be achieved by the same mechanism as seen in other nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin (41.Schmidt Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The nuclear export of proteins is mediated by NESs, the prototypic signal of which was originally identified in the HIV-1 Rev protein (21.Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lührmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar,42.Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Subsequently, structurally and functionally equivalent export signals have been described in various proteins, including human T-cell leukemia type I Rex (43.Palmeri D. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6442-6445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (42.Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (44.Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and the hdm-2 oncoprotein (15.Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) (depicted in Fig. 8 B). Moreover, this type of NES is composed of four critically spaced hydrophobic, mainly leucine residues, which appear to be required for the interaction of the NES with the export receptor CRM1 (36.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 37.Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 38.Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 45.Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In particular, the spacing of these hydrophobic (leucine) residues is considered to be a hallmark feature for this type of leucine-rich NES. The delineation of the NES of ribosomal protein L5 in this study, however, has revealed a different leucine-rich export signal. Obviously, the L5 NES (aa 101–111) is composed of critical leucines arranged in two separated clusters with no spacing between the individual leucine residues (Fig.8 B). Efficient nuclear export was observed with this signal, particularly when nucleolar retention of L5 was abolished by removing the protein regions that are responsible for 5 S rRNA binding and nucleolar targeting. Moreover, mutation of these leucine residues in the context of full-length L5-GFP demonstrated that this signal indeed affects the intracellular distribution of L5. This is in perfect agreement with the previous finding that the deletion of a short stretch of six amino acid residues in yeast ribosomal protein L1, which is the yeast homologue of L5, caused lethality in vivo (46.Deshmukh M. Stark J. Yeh L.-C.C. Lee J.C. Woolford Jr., J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30148-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taking our data into consideration, it is now obvious that this deletion (L1 aa 103–108: NH2-LLIARR-COOH) removed the central part of the L1 NES, a domain that is conserved among the eukaryotic 5 S rRNA-binding proteins. Finally, leptomycin B, a drug that has previously been shown to be an inhibitor of CRM1 (36.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 37.Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 38.Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) blocked the nuclear export of the L5 NES in our experiments. These data further support the notion that CRM1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich NESs in general. However, it remains to be seen whether additional factors are required for the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of specific RNAs such as 5 S rRNA.In summary, ribosomal protein L5 is characterized by a multidomain structure. The delineation of the regions that are required for nuclear import, nucleolar localization, and nuclear export provides a tool to search for as yet unidentified L5 interaction partners. Moreover, we expect that sequences similar to the L5 NES will soon be identified in other proteins that traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.Note Added in ProofSince submission of this work a similar study on Xenopus and rat L5 protein was published (Claußen, M., Rudt, F., and Pieler, T.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7.Guddat U. Bakken A.H. Pieler T. Cell. 1990; 60: 619-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10.Rudt F. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This transport activity requires the interaction of L5 with nuclear import and export factors. However, the regions in L5 that mediate these protein-protein interactions, as well as the region required for 5 S rRNA binding, have to date been poorly defined. In fact, evidence for a distinct domain organization in mammalian L5 originated from a previous study in which the domain structure of the L5 protein from rat was investigated (29.Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11571-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this work, it was shown that the L5 amino terminus (aa 1–93) contains a 5 S rRNA binding domain and that the carboxyl terminus (aa 151–296) harbors a signal that targets L5 to the nucleus/nucleolus.By investigating the subcellular localization of L5 fusion proteins in living as well as in fixed cells, we were able to map two independent regions that serve as nuclear/nucleolar targeting signals. The region located in the L5 amino terminus maps to amino acid residues at position 21–37 (depicted in Fig.8 A). Fusion of a corresponding amino acid sequence to otherwise cytoplasmic βGal resulted in nuclear accumulation of the respective fusion protein. Because the βGal reporter protein is not suitable to investigate L5 signals that confer nucleolar localization (29.Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11571-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we also fused this L5 sequence to GFP. This resulted in nucleolar accumulation of the respective L5-GFP fusion protein, whereas, in contrast, no nucleolar localization was detected when wild-type GFP was expressed (28.Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The combined data indicated that this amino-terminal region in L5 serves as both a strong nuclear localization and nucleolar targeting signal. A second region that is involved in directing L5 to specific subcellular compartments is located in the protein carboxyl terminus and maps to amino acid position 255–265 (Fig. 8 A). As with the amino-terminal signal, this region mediates the nucleolar localization of GFP. In contrast, this signal failed to target the ∼116-kDa βGal protein to the nucleus. Fusion of the carboxyl-terminal half of L5 (aa 150–297) to βGal, however, resulted in nuclear steady-state accumulation of this fusion protein. Subsequently, the microinjection of GST-GFP fusion proteins into the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of Vero cells revealed that the complete L5 carboxyl terminus (aa 255–297) is able to mediate nuclear import as well as nucleolar accumulation. However, the kinetic with which the respective GST-L5-GFP fusion protein translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was slow when compared with the kinetic of the NLS found within the SV40 large T-antigen in this type of experiment (data not shown). In fact, significant nuclear import of cytoplasmic GST-L5–255/297-GFP hybrid protein was observed ∼45 min postinjection, whereas, in contrast, the translocation of a similar GST-SV40 NLS-GFP construct was complete after ∼10 min. Thus, the L5 carboxyl terminus (aa 255–297) exerts weak nuclear import activity when compared with a classical NLS. Moreover, the sequence located between L5 aa positions 255 and 265 appears to be required, although not sufficient, to direct a heterologous protein into the nucleus. Note that the amino acid composition of this L5 region resembles loosely the NLS found within the SV40 large T-antigen. This prototypic NLS is characterized by a short peptide motif highly enriched with positively charged amino acids (40.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NLS located in the L5 amino terminus (aa 21–37) resembles a bipartite NLS of the type originally identified in nucleoplasmin. This type of signal is defined by two basic peptide regions that are separated by a spacer region of ∼10 amino acid residues (40.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). With respect to nuclear import it is also important to note that the L5 protein appears to form homodimers. Because the regions responsible for dimerization are not known, we cannot rule out the possibility that nuclear import of some reporter constructs may have occurred due to dimerization of the respective L5 fusion proteins with endogenous wild-type L5 protein.To date, no clear consensus sequence has been reached on what directs nuclear proteins to the nucleolus. Delineation of the sequence requirements for subcellular localization of chicken nucleolin has revealed that the RNA binding motifs in nucleolin also cause its accumulation in the nucleoli (41.Schmidt Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that nucleolin is not transported actively into the nucleoli but rather is retained in this specific subnuclear compartment as a result of its interaction with rRNA. In this study, analysis of the 5 S rRNA binding phenotypes using RNA gel retardation analyses demonstrated that the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions, which encompass the signals required for nuclear and nucleolar localization of L5 (aa 1–38 and 252–297), are necessary for 5 S rRNA binding. Obviously, these regions are characterized by a high number of basic residues that may contribute to RNA binding. In summary, it appears that binding of L5 to 5 S rRNA correlates with its ability to accumulate in the nucleoli. Thus, targeting of L5 to the nucleoli seems to be achieved by the same mechanism as seen in other nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin (41.Schmidt Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The nuclear export of proteins is mediated by NESs, the prototypic signal of which was originally identified in the HIV-1 Rev protein (21.Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lührmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar,42.Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Subsequently, structurally and functionally equivalent export signals have been described in various proteins, including human T-cell leukemia type I Rex (43.Palmeri D. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6442-6445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (42.Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (44.Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and the hdm-2 oncoprotein (15.Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) (depicted in Fig. 8 B). Moreover, this type of NES is composed of four critically spaced hydrophobic, mainly leucine residues, which appear to be required for the interaction of the NES with the export receptor CRM1 (36.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 37.Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 38.Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 45.Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In particular, the spacing of these hydrophobic (leucine) residues is considered to be a hallmark feature for this type of leucine-rich NES. The delineation of the NES of ribosomal protein L5 in this study, however, has revealed a different leucine-rich export signal. Obviously, the L5 NES (aa 101–111) is composed of critical leucines arranged in two separated clusters with no spacing between the individual leucine residues (Fig.8 B). Efficient nuclear export was observed with this signal, particularly when nucleolar retention of L5 was abolished by removing the protein regions that are responsible for 5 S rRNA binding and nucleolar targeting. Moreover, mutation of these leucine residues in the context of full-length L5-GFP demonstrated that this signal indeed affects the intracellular distribution of L5. This is in perfect agreement with the previous finding that the deletion of a short stretch of six amino acid residues in yeast ribosomal protein L1, which is the yeast homologue of L5, caused lethality in vivo (46.Deshmukh M. Stark J. Yeh L.-C.C. Lee J.C. Woolford Jr., J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30148-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taking our data into consideration, it is now obvious that this deletion (L1 aa 103–108: NH2-LLIARR-COOH) removed the central part of the L1 NES, a domain that is conserved among the eukaryotic 5 S rRNA-binding proteins. Finally, leptomycin B, a drug that has previously been shown to be an inhibitor of CRM1 (36.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 37.Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 38.Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) blocked the nuclear export of the L5 NES in our experiments. These data further support the notion that CRM1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich NESs in general. However, it remains to be seen whether additional factors are required for the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of specific RNAs such as 5 S rRNA.In summary, ribosomal protein L5 is characterized by a multidomain structure. The delineation of the regions that are required for nuclear import, nucleolar localization, and nuclear export provides a tool to search for as yet unidentified L5 interaction partners. Moreover, we expect that sequences similar to the L5 NES will soon be identified in other proteins that traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. In the present study, we have investigated the domain organization of ribosomal protein L5. L5 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein that is involved in the intracellular transport of 5 S rRNA (6.Steitz J.A. Berg C. Hendrick J.P. La Branche-Chabot H. Metspalu A. Rinke J. Yario T. J.

To understand the molecular mechanisms that mediate the regulation of NaSi-1, we have isolated and characterized the mouse NaSi-1 cDNA (mNaSi-1), gene (Nas1), and promoter region and determinedNas1 chromosomal localization. The mNaSi-1 cDNA encodes a protein of 594 amino acids with 13 putative transmembrane segments, inducing high affinity Na+-dependent transport of sulfate in Xenopus oocytes. Three different mNaSi-1 transcripts derived from alternative polyadenylation and splicing were identified in kidney and intestine.

The largest group of sulfoconjugates in mammals is sulfated proteoglycans, which are required for normal structure and function of bone and cartilage. Accordingly, three human congenital chondrodysplasias were recently shown to be caused by mutations in a sulfate transport protein gene (DTDST),1 leading to undersulfation of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix of bone and cartilage, and associated developmental abnormalities (2.Hastbacka J. de la Chapelle A.

Considering the importance of sulfate at a cellular and biochemical level, it is likely that mechanisms regulating the serum sulfate levels are essential for the maintenance of normal physiology. However, little is established about the molecular factors that regulate sulfate homeostasis, and the physiological consequence of a disturbance in sulfate homeostasis is mostly unknown. In mammals, the regulation of sulfate homeostasis is largely determined by the kidney with the majority of the filtered sulfate load reabsorbed in the proximal segment of the nephron. Transepithelial transport of sulfate from the renal lumen to the blood compartment involves entry through the brush-border membrane (BBM) by a Na+-dependent transport system, translocation across the cell and efflux across the basolateral membrane by an anion exchange system (5.Murer H. Manganel M. Roch-Ramel F. Winhager E. Handbook of Physiology. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 2165-2188Google Scholar). Early transport studies in BBM vesicles suggested that Na+-sulfate cotransport across the BBM is the rate-limiting step in the overall sulfate reabsorptive process (6.Besseghir K. Roch-Ramel F.

By expression cloning, we isolated a cDNA (NaSi-1) from rat kidney encoding a high affinity Na+-dependent sulfate transporter (8.Markovich D. Forgo J. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8073-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). NaSi-1 mRNA is expressed in kidney and small intestine and encodes a glycosylated protein (8.Markovich D. Forgo J. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8073-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that has been localized by immunohistochemistry to the BBM of proximal tubular cells (9.Lotscher M. Custer M. Quabius E.S. Kaissling B. Murer H. Biber J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, factors known to regulate renal Na+-sulfate reabsorption were found to regulate NaSi-1 expression in the kidney. Vitamin D was shown to modulate concomitantly serum sulfate concentration, renal sulfate handling, and the expression (mRNA and protein levels) and activity of the NaSi-1 cotransporter (10.Fernandes I. Hampson G. Cahours X. Morin P. Coureau C. Couette S. Prie D. Biber J. Murer H. Friedlander G. Silve C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2196-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). High sulfate intake in rats led to a reduction in both NaSi-1 mRNA and protein (11.Markovich D. Murer H. Biber J. Sakhaee K. Pak C. Levi M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas low sulfate intake (reduced methionine diet) led to an increase in both NaSi-1 mRNA and protein (12.Sagawa K. DuBois D.C. Almon R.R. Murer H. Morris M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1056-1062PubMed Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone, growth hormone, heavy metals, potassium intake, and anti-inflammatory agents were also found to regulate NaSi-1 expression (13.Puttaparthi K. Markovich D. Halaihel N. Wilson P.

It is suggested that these modulators could alter serum sulfate levels via the regulation of NaSi-1 expression in vivo, suggesting that sulfate homeostasis is controlled, at least in part, by NaSi-1. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation of NaSi-1 expression by these factors, as well as NaSi-1 contribution to body sulfate homeostasis, have yet to be defined. In order to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific and hormonal regulation of NaSi-1 and its role in sulfate homeostasis, we have cloned and characterized the mouse NaSi-1 cDNA and its corresponding gene. This study represents the first characterization of the genomic structure of a Na+-coupled sulfate transporter gene. We have also determined the pattern of NaSi-1 expression in mouse adult tissues, identified the existence of alternative transcripts, determined its chromosomal localization, and demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the promoter region is elevated in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3stimulation in a transiently transfected renal cell line. Oligonucleotides used during this study are listed in Table I. The mouse NaSi-1 (designated mNaSi-1) cDNA coding sequence was cloned using RT-PCR. Total RNA (5 μg) isolated from mouse kidney cortex was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified using primers derived from the rat NaSi-1 cDNA (designated rNaSi-1) coding sequence (8.Markovich D. Forgo J. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8073-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions. Semi-quantitative PCR amplification of mNaSi-1 was performed by comparing its abundance to β-actin. Preliminary optimization of the conditions showed that coamplification of mNaSi-1 and β-actin transcripts was occurring linearly through cycles 23–30. Total RNA treated with RNase-free DNase I enzyme was reverse-transcribed, and PCR amplification (30 cycles) was performed using 0.4 μm mNaSi-1 primers (FN252 and RN1220) and 0.1 μm β-actin primers. The identity of the mNaSi-1 PCR-amplified products in each tissue was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Fluorescence from ethidium bromide staining of each mNaSi-1 signal was compared with that of β-actin, by calculating the ratio (fluorescence units of mNaSi-1/fluorescence units of β-actin). Dye-termination sequencing was performed using the Big DyeTM Termination kit (Perkin-Elmer) following the manufacturer's protocol, and gel separation was performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility, the University of Queensland.Table IOligonucleotidesNameSequenceaPrimers were designed either from the rat or the mouse NaSi-1 cDNA sequences and are written from the 5′ to 3′ direction.PositionbThe number indicated refers to the nucleotide position within the mNaSi-1 cDNA sequence (A of ATG initiation codon defined as +1) where the 5′ end of the primer will anneal.StrandSense Nas1-specific primersFN-24TGTTGAAGGCACCTGCTCAGG−24SenseFN17ATGCTTTGGTCTATCGCCGCTTTC17SenseFN110GTGCCTACATCCTCTTTGTTATTG110SenseFN252CTTTCACCTTCTGCTAATTGGA252SenseFN390CACTGCCTTCTTATCTATGTGG390SenseFN665CAGTCACAGGAGCAAAATATCGG665SenseFN823GAATGTCGCTGCCTCCACTTTGG823SenseFN1386TCCTCTAGGTTCATTACCAGTTTG1386SenseFN1547TGCCTTCCACTCTCTGTACCTCA1547SenseAntisense Nas1-specific primersRN44AGGAGAAAGCGGCGATAGAC44AntisenseRN88TGATGAGAGGGAGTGGCAAGA88AntisenseRN137ATGGCAATAACAAAGAGGATGT137AntisenseRN226GTGAAGAACGCATGATCCCAAA226AntisenseRN308TTCCATTTCTCTATTGATGTTGCT308AntisenseRN535GGGCGGCAGATTCATTGAAATA535AntisenseRN687CCGATATTTTGCTCCTGTGACTG687AntisenseRN909GAGCCAAATCCAAGACAAAAGTAG909AntisenseRN1020CCCAAGTTTTTCATATTCTT1020AntisenseRN1220GTCATTTTTGTCAGTTTCTTGGC1220AntisenseRN1647CATGTCAATGACTTTCAGGTGG1647AntisenseRN1989AGGCGGGTAGATGCTCTTTGATTG1989Antisensea Primers were designed either from the rat or the mouse NaSi-1 cDNA sequences and are written from the 5′ to 3′ direction.b The number indicated refers to the nucleotide position within the mNaSi-1 cDNA sequence (A of ATG initiation codon defined as +1) where the 5′ end of the primer will anneal. Open table in a new tab The 5′- and 3′ end of mNaSi-1 cDNA were isolated using 5′- and 3′-RACE techniques, respectively, essentially as described by Chen (18.Chen Z. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For 5′-RACE, primer RN137 was used to reverse-transcribe mouse kidney total RNA and for a first round of PCR amplification. After nested amplification using primer RN88, PCR products were obtained and subcloned into pCR 2.1 vector. For 3′-RACE, kidney total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo(dT)/adapter primer. PCR amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Biotech International) was carried out using primer FN1547. The 3′-RACE technique was also used for identifying mNaSi-1 variants. In this case, total RNA from mouse kidney was reverse-transcribed using display THERMO-RTTM (Display Systems Biotech) reverse transcriptase, and PCR amplifications were performed using a 16:1 blend of Taq and Pfu(Promega) DNA polymerases with primers FN-24, FN110, FN823, or FN1547. The 5′-RACE technique was also used to confirm the position of the transcription start site (see below). In this case, primer RN535 was used for reverse transcription and first round of PCR, and primer RN226 was used for nested amplification. In addition, the display THERMO-RTTM reverse transcriptase was used to permit the utilization of high temperatures (42 °C for 40 min and 65 °C for 15 °C) avoiding an artificial termination due to the secondary structure of mRNA. Methods for handling of oocytes, in vitro transcription, and transport assay have been described previously (8.Markovich D. Forgo J. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stages V and VI oocytes were injected with either 50 nl of water (control) or 5 ng of mNaSi-1 cRNA using a Nanoject automatic oocyte injector (Drummond Scientific Co.). Northern analysis of total RNA (25 μg) from mouse tissues (Fig. 5) was performed as described previously (20.Beck L. Soumounou Y. Martel J. Krishnamurthy G. Gauthier C. Goodyer C.G. Tenenhouse H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Full-length mNaSi-1 cDNA was32P-labeled by random priming and used as a probe. After stripping, the membranes were rehybridized with a32P-labeled 1.3-kb mouse β-actin cDNA probe. Mouse genomic DNA (10 μg) prepared from mouse liver was digested with restriction enzymes (Fig. 3), separated on 0.7% agarose gels, and capillary transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond XL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After UV-cross linking, the membranes were hybridized (16–18 h at 65 °C) with a full-length32P-labeled mNaSi-1 cDNA probe in Church's buffer (0.5mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 10 mm EDTA). The membranes were then washed to high stringency and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR5 film at −80 °C for 48 h.Figure 3Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA. Mouse liver DNA (10 μg) was digested with BamHI,EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, orPstI, as indicated, electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a full-length32P-labeled mNaSi-1 cDNA probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The genomic clones were isolated from a λ FIX II mouse (129sv strain) genomic DNA library (Stratagene) using the method described by Lardelli and Lendahl (21.Lardelli M. Lendahl U. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 420-422PubMed Google Scholar). Five positive λ clones were purified and further analyzed. Some large introns were isolated from mouse genomic DNA using LA-PCR, as described elsewhere (22.Cheng S. Fockler C. Barnes W.M. Higuchi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Introns 1, 2, and 6–8 were amplified using primer pairs FN17/RN226, FN110/RN308, FN390/RN687, FN665/RN909, and FN823/RN1020, respectively. Identity and further characterization of the λ clones and PCR products were confirmed by Southern analysis and/or direct sequencing of the coding regions. Exon sizes were determined by nucleotide sequencing, and intron sizes were determined by either nucleotide sequencing or estimated from the size of corresponding PCR-generated DNA fragments using exon-specific primers. Location of and sequences at intron/exon boundaries of the Nas1 gene were determined by direct sequencing using Nas1-specific oligonucleotides. Primer extension analysis was performed using protocols and reagents provided by Promega (primer extension system). Briefly, two Nas1-specific primers located in exon 1 (RN44 and RN88) were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. Total RNA (10 μg) was mixed with 0.1 pmol of the labeled primer, denatured 5 min at 90 °C, and incubated at 55 °C for 16 h in hybridization buffer (0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 80% formamide). After reverse transcription using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase, the labeled cDNAs were separated through a 6% polyacrylamide gel.HinfI-φx174-digested DNA was end-labeled and used as a molecular weight marker. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR5 film for 48 h at −80 °C. Fine mapping of Nas1 was undertaken using the T-31 Radiation Hybrid Panel of the mouse genome (Research Genetics). Primers used for screening were FN1386 and RN1647, generating an intense 1.5-kb band from mouse genomic DNA and a faint 950-bp band from Chinese hamster DNA. The panel was screened twice using these primers and a third time using primers FN1547 and RN1989. Data analysis was performed by the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Radiation Hybrid Data Base. Three fragments containing 3229, 1203, and 457 bp of Nas1 5′-flanking sequence, respectively, were PCR-amplified from the λP2 clone (Fig. 4 A), subcloned into pCR2.1 vector, and sequenced. These fragments were then inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in a promoterless luciferase expression vector (pGL3-Basic, Promega) by restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Plasmids were designated pNas1-3229, pNas1-1203, and pNas1-457, respectively. The 1203-bp promoter fragment was also cloned in reverse orientation and designated pNas1-1203R. Correct insertion and sequence were verified by enzyme restriction digestion and sequencing. COS-1 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). OK cells were maintained in Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At 80% confluence, cells were cotransfected using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 0.8 μg of the Nas1 gene promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.8 μg of pRSVβGal plasmid (gift of Dr. M. Waters, University of Queensland) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Incubation with plasmids and LipofectAMINE was carried out for 24 h in normal growth medium, as recommended by the manufacturer. Controls were performed by transfection with pGL3-Basic (promoter-less plasmid) and pGL3-Control (containing the SV40 promoter). In experiments involving vitamin D, cells were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of a VDR expression vector alone or together with 0.2 μg of a human RXRα expression vector (VDR/pSG5 and RXR/pSG5 plasmids, respectively; generous gift from Dr. John White, McGill University). The VDR and hRXRα expression plasmids were cotransfected to ensure that a sufficient concentration of receptor was available for binding to the overexpressed Nas1 gene. Incubation with plasmids and LipofectAMINE was carried out for 24 h, after which the medium was replaced by fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with varying concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 for an additional 24 h. Cells were then harvested in cell lysis buffer, and the lysate was assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using protocols and reagents provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Luciferase activity was measured using a Trilux 1450 Microbeta (Wallac) luminometer. Data are shown as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. For the transport kinetic studies in oocytes, the Michaelis-Menten and generalized Hill equations were used to calculateK m and V max values using non-linear regression. The mouse Na+-sulfate cotransporter cDNA, mNaSi-1, was cloned using a combination of RT-PCR and 5′- and 3′-RACE techniques. The mNaSi-1 cDNA is 2246 bp long, with 28 bases of 5′-UTR, an open reading frame of 1782 bases, and 436 bases of 3′-UTR. The 3′-UTR contains a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at position 2180. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 594 amino acids (Fig.1 A) with a calculated molecular mass of 66.1 kDa, containing 13 putative transmembrane domains, predicted by the TopPred2 program (23.von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The mNaSi-1 protein contains one potential protein kinase A (Thr404) and five potential protein kinase C (Ser213, Thr218, Ser230, Thr322, and Thr422) phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1 A). Consensus sequences forN-glycosylation were found at Asn positions 140, 174, and 590 (Fig. 1 A). Alignment of the mouse and rat NaSi-1 amino acid sequences shows 93.6% identity and 96% similarity. Nucleotide sequence identity is 91% between mouse and rat NaSi-1. When this work was initiated, no ESTs with homology to mNaSi-1 were identified. At the submission of this manuscript, a search in the EST data base identified approximately 50 murine ESTs from kidney, all identical to mNaSi-1. Homology searches using BLAST (24.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar) and PSI-BLAST (25.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar) revealed significant homology to 22 other proteins (Fig. 1 B), although the closest relatives are the recently reported human Na+-sulfate cotransporter SUT-1 (49% identity (26.Girard J.P. Baekkevold E.S. Feliu J. Brandtzaeg P. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12772-12777Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) and the Na+-dicarboxylate transporters sharing ∼32–43% protein sequence identity with mNaSi-1. Of particular interest is a consensus pattern previously established for Na+-coupled symporters (PROSITE PS01271) known as the Na+-sulfate signature, present at amino acids 522–538 in the mNaSi-1 protein containing a very high degree of homology with other related proteins (Fig. 1 B). To determine the functionality of the isolated clone, we injected mNaSi-1 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes followed by [35S]sulfate radiotracer uptake assay. Sulfate uptake in mNaSi-1-cRNA-injected oocytes was Na+-dependent and showed typical Michaelis-Menten saturation, with a calculatedK m value for sulfate of 0.20 ± 0.06 mm and V max of 49.2 ± 4.1 pmol/h (data not shown), in agreement with the BBM Na+-sulfate cotransporter (5.Murer H. Manganel M. Roch-Ramel F. Winhager E. Handbook of Physiology. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 2165-2188Google Scholar). mNaSi-1 mRNA expression was screened by RT-PCR in 23 murine tissues (Fig.2). An amplified mNaSi-1 fragment was obtained in RNA from kidney, duodenum/jejunum, ileum, and colon. Lower levels of mNaSi-1 mRNA expression were observed in cecum, testis, adrenal, and adipose tissue. By normalizing the mNaSi-1 mRNA signal to β-actin, the relative abundance of mNaSi-1 in kidney and ileum was found to be similar and approximately twice as high as those found in duodenum/jejunum and colon (Fig. 2 B; n = 3). The physiological importance of the low level of expression of mNaSi-1 found in testis, adrenal, and adipose tissue remains to be determined. Southern blotting was used to estimate the size and complexity of the gene encoding mNaSi-1, designatedNas1 (Fig. 3). Results show that the estimated size of the Nas1 gene was approximately 45 kb, which was lower than the actual size of the Nas1 gene determined from genomic cloning (see below). This was due both to the presence of comigrating bands and large introns that did not hybridize with the cDNA probe. Blots washed at both high and low stringency gave similar results, suggesting that Nas1 is a single copy gene. Screening of a genomic λ phage library led to the isolation of five λ Nas1 clones containing the 5′-flanking region and most of the Nas1-coding region (Fig.4 A). Introns 1, 2, and 6–8 not present in the λ clones were obtained using LA-PCR (Fig.4 A). The λ clones and PCR-amplified introns overlapped, covering a 80-kb region comprising the entire Nas1 gene (Fig. 4 A). Southern analysis of the Nas1 genomic clones was consistent with the data obtained from Southern blotting of mouse genomic DNA and confirmed that Nas1 is a single copy gene. The resulting exon-intron organization of the mouseNas1 gene is shown in Fig. 4 B. TheNas1 spans ∼75 kb and contains 15 exons. The translation initiation site is present in exon 1. Exon sizes range from 49 to 188 bp, except for exon 15, which is 555 bp and contains the TGA stop codon (Fig. 4 C and Table II). Intron sizes range from 70 bp to 15 kb (Table II). All exon-intron boundaries conform to canonical splice donor and acceptor consensus sequences, and the codon phase usage is mainly 0 or II (Table II). Comparison of predicted protein transmembrane domains to exon border structure showed that each predicted transmembrane segment is encoded by a separate exon, with the exception of transmembrane domains 10 and 11, which are encoded by the same exon (exon 13). In addition, splicing mostly occurred near membrane/aqueous transitions (Fig. 4 D).Table IIExon/intron organization of the mouse Nas1 geneIntron numberLocation5′ splice donoraExon sequences are indicated by uppercase letters and intron sequences by lowercase letters.Intron sizebIntron size was determined by restriction analysis, direct sequencing for small introns, and by estimating the size of PCR amplification products for large introns.3′ splice acceptoraExon sequences are indicated by uppercase letters and intron sequences by lowercase letters.Amino acidcAmino acids encoded at the splice sites are indicated.Codon phasedIntrons that do not split codon triplets are indicated by phase 0, interruption after the first nucleotide by phase I, and interruption after the second nucleotide by phase II.Exon numberExon sizebpbp199ACCAAG/gtaagcaagc…15,000…ccctttgcag/GAAGCALys011272228TCACAG/gtaacataat…12,500…gcaatttcag/GTGGCTGln021293365AGCCTG/gtgagtatta…2,500…ctcgtttcag/GCTGACTrpII31374553TTGATG/gtatcatgta…600…tatcttacag/AAACTGGlu I41885611TCCAGG/gtaaagacta…70…tatgtttcag/AAGCAGGlyII5586660GAAAAG/gtacattaca…13,500…ttgattacag/AATGCALys06497794GATCTT/gtataaagct…10,000…cttattgcag/CTCTGAPheII71348932ATTCGA/gtaagtagac…3,500…tctctttcag/CTTTAAAspII813891028AATGAG/gttaaaattg…560…tcttccacag/GTATCAArgII996101130TTCAGA/gttgagtatc…3,100…tatttttcag/GTACCCGluII10102111237AAATTA/gttgagtatc…2,400…tattttgcag/TTGCTTIle I11107121347TGTCAG/gtaatgctca…4,800…tgtattgtag/GTATCAGln012110131509CCTTTG/gtgagtatga…1,250…tccatgccag/GCTGAALeu013162141647GACATG/gtaagtcagc…1,500…tgttactaag/GTTAAAMet01413815555a Exon sequences are indicated by uppercase letters and intron sequences by lowercase letters.b Intron size was determined by restriction analysis, direct sequencing for small introns, and by estimating the size of PCR amplification products for large introns.c Amino acids encoded at the splice sites are indicated.d Introns that do not split codon triplets are indicated by phase 0, interruption after the first nucleotide by phase I, and interruption after the second nucleotide by phase II.

A cysteine-less CTP retaining wild-type functional properties served as the starting template. The single Cys CTP variants were overexpressed inEscherichia coli, isolated, and functionally reconstituted in a liposomal system. The accessibility of each single Cys mutant to three methanethiosulfonate reagents was evaluated by determining the pseudo first order rate constants for inhibition of CTP function. These rate constants varied by seven orders of magnitude. With three independent data sets we observed peaks and troughs in the rate constant data at identical amino acid positions and a periodicity of four was observed from residues 177–193. Based on the pattern of accessibility we conclude that residues 177–193 exist as an α-helix. Furthermore, a water-accessible face of the helix has been defined consisting of Pro-177, Val-178, Arg-181, Gln-182, Asn-185, Gln-186, Arg-189, Leu-190, and Tyr-193, and a water-inaccessible face has been delineated consisting of Ser-179, Met-180, Ala-183, Ala-184, Ala-187, Val-188, Gly-191, and Ser-192.

We infer that the water-accessible face comprises a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP, whereas the water-inaccessible surface faces the lipid bilayer. citrate transport protein transmembrane domain sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)-methane-thiosulfonate [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethio-sulfonate bromide (2-aminoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide methanethiosulfonate 1,2,3- benzenetricarboxylate The citrate transport protein (i.e.CTP)1 from mammalian mitochondria catalyzes an electroneutral exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane of a tricarboxylate (i.e. citrate, isocitrate, cis-aconitate) plus a proton, for either another tricarboxylate-H+, a dicarboxylate (i.e. malate, succinate), or phosphoenolpyruvate (1.Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Following the efflux of citrate from the mitochondrial matrix via the CTP, cytoplasmic citrate serves as both a carbon precursor for the fatty acid and the sterol biosynthetic pathways, as well as a source of NAD+ (via the concerted actions of ATP-citrate lyase and malate dehydrogenase) for the glycolytic pathway (2.Watson J.A.

Because of the central role of the CTP in higher eukaryotic metabolism, the transporter has been extensively studied. Thus, it has been purified (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bisaccia F. De Palma A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13682-13690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpressed (10.Xu Y. Mayor J.A. Gremse D. Wood D.O. Kaplan R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently we have extended our studies of the CTP to the yeast homologue of the higher eukaryotic protein (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An advantage afforded by the yeast mitochondrial CTP is that following overexpression in Escherichia coli and subsequent isolation, CTP function can be reconstituted with high specific activity. Thus, the yeast CTP represents ideal material with which to conduct a comprehensive structure/function analysis. With this goal in mind, we recently constructed a Cys-less CTP that displays near native functional properties. 2Xu, Y., Kakhniashvili, D. A., Gremse, D. A., Wood, D. O., Mayor, J. A., Walters, D. E., and Kaplan, R. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275,7117–7124. Moreover, we have demonstrated that upon isolation, both the isolated wild-type and Cys-less CTPs exist as functional dimers. 3Kotaria, R., Mayor, J. A., Walters, D. E., and Kaplan, R. S. (1999) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 31, 543–549. Based on hydropathy analysis, each monomer of the homodimer is predicted to contain six membrane-spanning domains (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Within the CTP, transmembrane domain IV (i.e. TMDIV) is of particular interest for several reasons. First, this domain contains two arginine residues (Arg-181 and -189). We have previously demonstrated that CTP function requires the presence of positive charge at both sites.2 Second, TMDIV can be modeled as an α-helix with both arginines residing on the same face of the helix, thereby providing a polar domain, which might conceivably be accessible to citrate and provide a partial neutralization of the negative charge associated with this substrate. Finally, our earlier studies have shown that chemical modification of Cys-192 within TMDIV causes substantial alteration in CTP activity.2 In combination, the above findings point to the importance of this transmembrane domain in CTP function. In the present paper, we report results from experiments designed to investigate the topology of TMDIV. Utilizing the Cys-less CTP as the starting template, we mutated one at a time, 22 consecutive residues within TMDIV to cysteine. We overexpressed, solubilized, and functionally reconstituted each single Cys mutant in liposomal vesicles. We then measured the accessibility of each mutant to hydrophilic cysteine-specific reagents (i.e. MTSES, MTSET, and MTSEA) by determining the pseudo first order rate constant for inhibition of citrate transport. Depending upon the location of a given Cys in the primary structure, these rate constants differed by as much as seven orders of magnitude. Based on the periodicity of the accessibility of residues 174–193 to all three MTS derivatives, our results clearly show that TMDIV exists as an α-helix from residues 177–193. Moreover, both the water-accessible and -inaccessible faces of this helix have been clearly defined. We infer from these studies that the water-accessible face represents a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP, and the water-inaccessible surface likely faces the lipid bilayer. Single Cys CTP genes were prepared using the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers were analyzed with Oligo 5.0 software and were purchased commercially. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications and subsequent cloning steps were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Cys-less CTP gene in pET-21a(+) was utilized as the starting template. Transformants were screened for the presence of inserts via restriction digestion of plasmid DNA (purified with the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega)) withNdeI and BamHI. The DNA from positive clones was then partially sequenced to assure the presence of the desired mutation. Plasmids scoring positive for the mutation of interest were then subcloned into the storage (NovaBlue) and expression (BL21(DE3)) hosts as described previously in detail (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of the entire CTP open reading frame using plasmid, which was purified from the expression strain and contained the desired mutation, as template. All sequencing was carried out at the fee-for-service Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility. Overexpression of mutant CTPs in E. coli, the isolation of the inclusion body fraction, and the solubilization of the single Cys CTP variants from inclusions bodies with 1.2% sarkosyl were performed exactly as described previously (10.Xu Y. Mayor J.A. Gremse D. Wood D.O. Kaplan R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overexpressed, isolated, single cys CTP mutants were incorporated into preformed asolectin vesicles via the freeze-thaw-sonication procedure, which we have previously described in detail (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to the transport assay, a given sample was thawed and sonicated on ice (30 sonic bursts; 0.7 s/burst). Extraliposomal citrate was removed on small Dowex columns in Pasteur pipettes, and the sample was immediately assayed for transport. Where indicated, the quantity of protein incorporated into phospholipid vesicles was determined via centrifugation of the Dowex eluate for 1.5 h at ∼314,000 × g (maximum) followed by assay of the resulting supernatant and pellet fractions for protein via the method of Kaplan and Pedersen (14.Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which was modified as previously detailed (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the MTS reagents on BTC-sensitive reconstituted citrate transport was determined as follows. All transport incubations were conducted at room temperature (i.e. 21.0 ± 1.3 °C; mean ± S.D.). Proteoliposomes (45 μl) were preincubated with buffer (3.5 μl) (6.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 s followed by the addition of a given concentration of freshly prepared MTS reagent (3.5 μl). The concentration of MTS reagent utilized was determined by an initial series of experiments with each CTP variant-reagent combination, in which the MTS reagent concentration was varied by several orders of magnitude to determine both the maximal inhibition that could be obtained, as well as the levels of reagent needed to obtain varying extents of inhibition at rates that could be measured (i.e. in the 3–2400 s range). Following preincubation with a given concentration of MTS reagent, transport was subsequently triggered via the addition of 21.5 μl of [1,5-14C]citrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; specific radioactivity ∼2.4 × 104 dpm/nmol; concentration in reaction mix, 1.04 mm). Reactions were allowed to proceed for a time interval defined by the intrinsic activity of a given mutant. Thus, these reaction times were empirically determined such that in the absence of MTS reagent less than ∼2500 cpm were transported into the liposomes in a BTC-sensitive manner. We have previously shown that these conditions approximate initial rate conditions.2 All transport reactions were quenched by the addition of 3.5 μl of BTC (final concentration in reaction mix, 9.0 mm). Utilizing the above reaction sequence, multiple reactions were carried out in which the length of the preincubation time with the MTS reagent prior to the citrate addition was varied, thereby generating a time course for the extent of inactivation. Experimental and control reactions were routinely run during each time course experiment. With both of these reactions, water was added instead of the MTS reagent. Otherwise the experimental transport reaction was carried out exactly as described above, except only a single time interval between the water addition and the addition of [14C]citrate was utilized. With the control transport reaction the order of addition of buffer and BTC was reversed. Thus the control received 3.5 μl of BTC at the beginning of the preincubation sequence (thereby blocking the citrate transporter and correcting for any final counts because of sources not related to CTP function (e.g. efficiency of the subsequent Dowex chromatography step)) and buffer instead of BTC at the end of the reaction sequence. Therefore, the experimental and control tubes received the identical concentrations of each component, with only the order of addition being altered. Following all transport reactions, intraliposomal radiolabeled citrate was separated by chromatography on small Dowex columns (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and was quantified via liquid scintillation counting. The proportion of activity remaining after incubation with a given MTS reagent was then calculated by: 1) subtracting the control transport rate from the rate observed in the presence of MTS reagent; and 2) determining the ratio of this difference to the uninhibited BTC-sensitive citrate transport rate (i.e. the experimental rate − control rate measured in the presence of water instead of MTS reagent). Finally, control studies, using liposomes reconstituted with the Cys-less CTP, indicated that the observed effect of each MTS reagent was not because of a nonspecific effect on either the liposomal bilayer or the CTP. Time course data for inactivation (or activation) of the CTP by the cysteine modifying reagents MTSES, MTSET, and MTSEA were fitted to a simple exponential function by unweighted Marquardt nonlinear least squares according to the following equations: rt = (r0 − r ∞) ×e −m×c×t +r ∞ where rt is the observed activity remaining at time t (seconds),r0 is the initial activity,r ∞ is the asymptotic activity att = ∞, c is reagent concentration (μm−1), and m is the rate constant for inactivation (sec−1μm−1). Plots of the log10transformed estimates of m against residue number revealed simple linear trends in the data that were fitted by least squares. Fourier analysis of the deviations from the least squares fitted lines were implemented using the fast Fourier transformation algorithm of Mathematica. For each reagent, MTSES, MTSET, MTSEA, unweighted Marquardt nonlinear least squares fits were obtained to the periodic function log10 m = sn − i + a × Sin((n − x) × 2π/p) wheren is residue number, s and i are the slope and intercept of the straight line, a is amplitude,p is the periodicity over 2π radians, and x is a constant to set the register with respect to n. Additional detail is depicted in the legend to Fig. 3. Hydropathy analysis indicates that TMDIV is the most polar of the transmembrane domains within the CTP (11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For reasons outlined in the Introduction this domain is thought to be of particular importance to CTP function. With this background in mind, we employed the following strategy to investigate the topology of TMDIV. First, we mutated residues 173–194 one at a time to cysteine, using a Cys-less CTP as the starting template. As depicted in Fig.1, these residues are thought to comprise TMDIV. Second, we overexpressed the Cys-less CTP and each of the 22 single Cys CTP mutants in E. coli. Each CTP variant was extracted from isolated inclusion bodies with the detergent sarkosyl and was then functionally reconstituted in liposomes. We have previously described this methodology in detail (10.Xu Y. Mayor J.A. Gremse D. Wood D.O. Kaplan R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11.Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)2and have shown that it results in abundant quantities of both the wild-type and Cys-less CTPs, which are highly functional when incorporated into phospholipid vesicles (i.e. they display essentially native kinetic properties and substrate specificity). Finally, we characterized the ability of three MTS reagents (i.e. MTSES, MTSET, and MTSEA) to inhibit the function of each CTP mutant. Thus, with each single Cys CTP variant the pseudo first order rate constant was determined for inhibition by each MTS reagent. There are several assumptions implicit to this approach (15.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 16.Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20.Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). First, it is assumed that following mutation of a given residue to Cys, if significant 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (i.e. the defining inhibitor of the CTP)-sensitive citrate transport remains, then the structure of the mutant CTP is similar to that of the wild-type transporter, and the introduced Cys side chain occupies a position similar to that of the original wild-type side chain. Second, we assume that within TMDIV only those residues, which are located on a water-accessible surface of the protein, will rapidly react with MTSES or MTSET. This assumption is based on: (i) the well documented observation that these two highly polar reagents are impermeable to a lipid bilayer in the absence of a transport or channel protein (15, 21, and our own findings as described below); and (ii) the fact that MTS reagents react 5 × 109 faster with the ionized thiolate anion than with the unionized thiol group, and the former is formed only upon exposure of the thiol group to water (20.Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22.Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Third, we assume that within TMDIV only the water-accessible surface participates in the formation of the citrate translocation pathway through the CTP. Fourth, we assume that covalent addition of the -SCH2CH2 X group to an exposed cysteine will interfere with citrate transport. Thus, rapid inhibition of transport (i.e. inhibition characterized by a high pseudo first order rate constant) is taken as evidence that the modified Cys side chain faces the translocation pathway in a region that is sufficiently narrow such that its modification blocks transport. Fig. 2 depicts the reconstituted citrate transport specific activity values observed with the Cys-less CTP and the 22 single Cys CTP variants. It is noteworthy that with the exception of the previously documented R181C and R189C variants,2 all CTP mutants displayed significant BTC-sensitive citrate transport activity. The values ranged from a low of 3% (of the Cys-less control value) observed with the Q182C variant, to values that were 160–170% of the control value reported for the P177C, S179C, and A187C variants. These results indicate that, with the exception of the R181C and R189C mutants, the overall structural and functional integrity of the CTP has been preserved with the panel of single Cys variants. As described above, this is a prerequisite for the MTS accessibility studies and suggests that the strategy of probing single Cys accessibilities should yield important structural information (18.Kurz L.L. Zuhlke R.D. Zhang H.-J. Joho R.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two additional points are noteworthy. First, with each CTP variant we directly measured the proportion of added protein that actually incorporated into the phospholipid vesicles. Thus, proteoliposomes were pelleted via ultracentrifugation, and the resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were then assayed for protein. We observed with the 22 single Cys mutants that 72.4% ± 7.1% (mean ± S.D. for the 22 mutants) of the added protein incorporated into the liposomes. Therefore, each of the mutant CTPs incorporated into phospholipid vesicles to a similar extent and the alterations observed in reconstituted citrate transport activity (i.e. Fig. 2) do not arise as a consequence of preferential incorporation of one mutantversus another. Second, substantial overexpression was achieved with each of the single Cys variants. Thus, following solubilization of inclusion body protein with sarkosyl, we obtained 22–70 mg of each single Cys CTP variant/liter of E. coliculture at a purity of ∼70%. We measured the accessibility of each single Cys CTP mutant to three MTS derivatives (i.e. MTSES, MTSET, and MTSEA). These reagents are small, charged, water soluble, and cysteine-specific (15.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). They form a mixed disulfide via addition of -SCH2CH2 Xto the reduced sulfhydryl of cysteine where X is SO3−, N(CH3)3+, or NH3+ for MTSES, MTSET, and MTSEA, respectively (15.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 16.Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol.

Importantly, similar to the findings reported by Holmgren et al. (21.Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we observed that when employing liposomes loaded with 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and dithiothreitol (in the absence of added protein), MTSES and MTSET do not significantly permeate the lipid bilayer, whereas in marked contrast MTSEA is quite permeable (data not shown). With each single Cys CTP variant we measured the rate of inhibition of citrate transport at multiple reagent concentrations. From this data, the pseudo first order rate constant for inhibition at a given residue was calculated. Plots of these rate constants versus residue number are depicted in Fig. 3, and the parameters calculated from this analysis are listed in TableI.Table ILeast squares fit estimates for residues 177–193ReagentSlopeAmplitudeRegisterPeriodicityCorrelation coefficientMTSES0.32 ± 0.052.12 ± 0.31176.5 ± 0.24.04 ± 0.080.95MTSET0.36 ± 0.041.59 ± 0.25176.6 ± 0.24.06 ± 0.080.96MTSEA0.12 ± 0.041.42 ± 0.29176.3 ± 0.34.07 ± 0.110.87Mean deviation1.81 ± 0.22176.4 ± 0.24.09 ± 0.060.92Parameters were calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab Parameters were calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Fig. 3 A depicts the results obtained with MTSES. Several points are noteworthy. First, the calculated rate constants vary by seven orders of magnitude depending upon residue position. In fact in some cases adjacent residues differ in accessibility by as much as four to five orders of magnitude (e.g. residues 182–183 and 184–185). Second, from residues 177–193 a periodicity of approximately four is observed (see Table I). This is quite suggestive of an α-helical secondary structure in this region. Furthermore, the rate constant data define a highly accessible face of the helix. Based on the assumption that the introduced Cys residues occupy the same positions as the wild-type side chains, we conclude that the side chains of the following wild-type residues constitute the water-accessible face of TMDIV and thus perhaps a portion of the citrate translocation pathway: Pro-177, Gln-182, Asn-185, Gln-186, Leu-190, and Tyr-193. In contrast, a highly inaccessible face is defined, which consists of Ser-179, Met-180, Ala-183, Ala-184, Ala-187, Val-188, and Ser-192. Superimposed on this periodicity, there exists a gradient of decreasing accessibility from the near side (i.e. residue 193) to the far side (i.e. residue 174) of the membrane as denoted by the dashed line. Thus the externally added MTSES, which does not penetrate a lipid bilayer unless an aqueous pathway is formed by the CTP, in general has greater accessibility to those residues that are more closely located to its site of addition. It should be noted that five residues were not amenable to study via this approach. Upon mutation of either Arg-181 or Arg-189 to Cys, the CTP is rendered nonfunctional (see Fig. 2). In contrast, although the R173C mutant retained function, even very high concentrations of MTSES caused minimal inhibition (i.e. <30%). A similar finding was obtained with the G191C mutation. Interestingly, with the N194C mutant MTSES did not inhibit but in fact caused a small stimulation of CTP function (data not shown). Fig. 3 B depicts the results obtained with the positively charged reagent MTSET. Several points are noteworthy. First, we see an identical periodicity in accessibility to this reagent as was observed with the MTSES. Thus, the same residues comprise the accessible and inaccessible faces of the TMDIV α-helix. Second, with MTSET we were able to obtain a rate constant for the G191C mutant, and this value is consistent with the expected limited accessibility of this position. Interestingly, with the N194C mutant we observed substantial stimulation by MTSET (i.e. activities that were 200–300% of the value observed in the absence of reagent). Thus, with this mutant we calculated the rate constant for the activation reaction. The resulting out of phase rate constant suggests that the transmembrane α-helix does not extend to residue 194. Third, as depicted in TableI, the slope of the line portraying the near side to far side decrease in accessibility is nearly identical to that observed with the MTSES. This finding indicates that the origin of observed accessibility decrease with increasing depth in the membrane is unlikely to be electrostatic in nature. Finally, it is interesting to note that the amplitude of the fitted curve is somewhat lower for MTSET compared with MTSES (i.e. 1.59 ± 0.25 versus 2.12 ± 0.31), reflecting primarily a moderate reduction in the accessibility of the most accessible residues to MTSET. Fig. 3 C depicts the results obtained with MTSEA. Once again the rate constant data display a periodicity of four from residues 177–193 with the identical residues comprising the accessible and inaccessible faces of the α-helix as observed with the other reagents. An important reason for utilizing this reagent was based on our earlier finding2 that the function of the R181C and R189C mutants could be partially restored by chemical modification of the Cys side chain with MTSEA, which served to restore a positive charge to these sites. Thus, we were able to determine the pseudo first order rate constants for this activation reaction. Importantly, as predicted from the fitted curves in Fig. 3 (A andB), residues 181 and 189 both reside on the accessible face of the helix. It is interesting to note that compared to the other MTS reagents exami"
https://openalex.org/W2163989613,"A member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family was identified inDrosophila. DTRAF1 contains 7 zinc finger domains followed by a TRAF domain, similar to mammalian TRAFs and other members of the family identified in data bases from Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, and Dictyostelium. Analysis of DTRAF1 binding to different members of the human TNF receptor family showed that this protein can interact through its TRAF domain with the p75 neurotrophin receptor and weakly with the lymphotoxin-β receptor. DTRAF1 can also self-associate and binds to human TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF4. Interestingly, DTRAF1 interacts with human cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 but not with Drosophila DIAP-1 and -2. By itself, DTRAF1 did not induce significant NFκB activation when overexpressed in mammalian cells, although it specifically increased NFκB induction by TRAF6. In contrast, TRAF2-mediated NFκB induction was partially inhibited by DTRAF1. Mutants of DTRAF1 lacking the N-terminal region inhibited NFκB induction by either TRAF2 or TRAF6. DTRAF1 specifically associated with the regulatory N-terminal domain of Pelle, a Drosophila homolog of the human kinase interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Interestingly, though Pelle and DTRAF1 individually were unable to induce NFκB in a human cell line, co-expression of Pelle and DTRAF1 resulted in significant NFκB activity. Interactions of DTRAF1 with human TRAF-, TNF receptor-, and IAP-family proteins imply strong evolutionary conservation of TRAF protein structure and function throughout Metazoan evolution. A member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family was identified inDrosophila. DTRAF1 contains 7 zinc finger domains followed by a TRAF domain, similar to mammalian TRAFs and other members of the family identified in data bases from Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, and Dictyostelium. Analysis of DTRAF1 binding to different members of the human TNF receptor family showed that this protein can interact through its TRAF domain with the p75 neurotrophin receptor and weakly with the lymphotoxin-β receptor. DTRAF1 can also self-associate and binds to human TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF4. Interestingly, DTRAF1 interacts with human cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 but not with Drosophila DIAP-1 and -2. By itself, DTRAF1 did not induce significant NFκB activation when overexpressed in mammalian cells, although it specifically increased NFκB induction by TRAF6. In contrast, TRAF2-mediated NFκB induction was partially inhibited by DTRAF1. Mutants of DTRAF1 lacking the N-terminal region inhibited NFκB induction by either TRAF2 or TRAF6. DTRAF1 specifically associated with the regulatory N-terminal domain of Pelle, a Drosophila homolog of the human kinase interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Interestingly, though Pelle and DTRAF1 individually were unable to induce NFκB in a human cell line, co-expression of Pelle and DTRAF1 resulted in significant NFκB activity. Interactions of DTRAF1 with human TRAF-, TNF receptor-, and IAP-family proteins imply strong evolutionary conservation of TRAF protein structure and function throughout Metazoan evolution. tumor necrosis factor receptor TNF receptor-associated factor polymerase chain reaction lymphotoxin-β receptor p75 neurotrophin receptor glutathione S-transferase inhibitor of apoptosis interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase death receptor 4 Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1 superfamily can elicit a wide spectrum of cellular responses, including regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (1.Wallach D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several of these functions are mediated by a family of intracellular TNFR-binding proteins, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) (1.Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In humans and mice, six members of the TRAF family (TRAF1 through TRAF6) have been identified. All of these proteins share as a defining characteristic a conserved stretch of amino acids near their C termini termed the TRAF domain. The TRAF domain is required for binding of these signal-transducing adaptor proteins to specific members of the TNF family of receptors (3.Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Intrinsic redundancies may exist among TRAF family members. For instance, different TRAFs can bind to the same TNFR-family receptor. Also, different TRAFs can activate similar transduction pathways. In this regard, TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 have been shown to activate NFκB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase when overexpressed in cells, whereas TRAF1, TRAF3, and TRAF4 do not (4.Rothe M. Sarma V.

Despite the apparent redundancy, specific roles for each of the TRAF-family proteins in the signal transduction pathways regulated by particular TNF-family receptors are beginning to emerge from gene knock-out studies in mice, strongly suggesting cell context dependence (10.Yeh W.C.

Another family of receptor proteins utilizing TRAF proteins as signal transduction mediators is the interleukin-1 receptor/Toll family. The interleukin-1 receptor/Toll family of receptors is involved in host defenses against microbial pathogens (14.Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 15.Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Among the TRAFs, only TRAF6 has been shown to participate in signal transduction processes mediated by the interleukin-1 receptor/Toll family of receptors (8.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), promotes larval hematopoiesis (17.Qiu P. Pan P.C. Govind S.

Two proteins known as Tube and Pelle mediate signaling by the cytoplasmic tail of Toll. Tube is a unique protein (18.Letsou A. Alexander S. Orth K. Wasserman S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas Pelle is a serine/threonine protein kinase homologous to the mammalian kinase IRAK (19.Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Both proteins contain in their N-terminal region a death domain that is required for interaction between Pelle and Tube (20.Shen B. Manley J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Schiffmann D.A. White J.H. Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Harding S.E. Jumel K. Solari R. Ray K.P. Gay N.J.

Upon ligand binding to Toll, Pelle becomes activated and phosphorylates itself, Toll, Tube, and several other substrates. This process culminates in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Cactus, the fly homologue of mammalian IκB, thus allowing Dorsal, theDrosophila counterpart of mammalian NFκB, to translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression (14.Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 20.Shen B. Manley J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we have identified a Drosophila TRAF protein. We show that this TRAF-family protein is able to bind some mammalian TNFR-family receptors and TRAFs and that it can modulate the NFκB pathway in human cells, suggesting strong structural and functional conservation of TRAFs throughout Metazoan evolution. Also, we show thatDrosophila TRAF (DTRAF-1) is a likely component of the Toll/Spatzle/Pelle signaling complex, based on its ability to interact with Pelle and to regulate Pelle-mediated NFκB activation. ADrosophila TRAF homologue (DTRAF1) was identified by sequence comparison searches of the public data bases using the Blast program (NCBI-NIH) and using as template the cDNA encoding the TRAF domain of hTRAF4. Multiple sequence alignments were made using the clustalW program. Exon and splice-site predictions were performed using the gene finder program from Baylor College of Medicine. DTRAF1 cDNAs were isolated from a Drosophila cDNA embryo (0–4 h) pNB40 library by PCR (23.Brown N.H. Kafatos F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The primers used for the amplification of the full-length DTRAF1 cDNA consisted of a primer containing the SP6 polymerase recognition sequence located upstream of the cloning site in the pNB40 plasmid and the reverse primer 5′-GTACTCGAGCTTAGACGGCCACTATCTTGCT-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pcR-BluntII topo plasmid (Invitrogen). Further PCR amplification for subcloning into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA-3-myc (Invitrogen) was performed using the primer-pair 5′-CCAGGATCCATTATGGGCTCCTTGG-3′ and 5′-ATATCTCGAGTTAGACGGCCACTATCTTGCTGAGATCCAC-3′. The DTRAF1 N-terminal deletion mutants DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) and DTRAF1 (Δ1–226) were also amplified by PCR using the forward primers 5′-ATAGAATTCTCGGCTGACACACTG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGGGATCCATCAACTACACAGGC-3′, respectively, and the reverse primer described above. After heating at 94 °C for 2 min PCR was performed using 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 100 s, followed by a final cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT), 1 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Plasmids containing cDNAs encompassing the complete open reading frames of hTRAF1 (pSG5-TRAF1), hTRAF2 (pcDNA3-HA-TRAF2), hTRAF3 (pbluscriptKS-TRAF3b), hTRAF4 (pcDNA3-HA-TRAF4), hTRAF5 (pcDNA3-Flag-TRAF5), and hTRAF6 (pcDNA3-myc-TRAF6) have been previously described (6.Nakano H.

Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described (34.Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using the EGY48 strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MATa, trp1, ura3, his, leu::plexApo6-leu2). Cells were grown in either yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium with 1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose or in Burkholder minimal medium fortified with appropriate amino acids as described previously (35.Sato T. Irie S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Transformations were performed using a LiCl method with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 100 μg of denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA. The DNA binding domain plasmids, pEG202 or pGilda, and the activation domain plasmid, pJG4–5, containing cDNAs encoding Bax, Ras, the cytoplasmic domain of Fas, the cytoplasmic domain of Toll(829–1097), Tube, Pelle(1–501), and the deletion mutants Pelle(1–209) and Pelle(219–501) were previously described (24.Sato T.

The fragment of DTRAF1 cDNA encoding amino acids 125 to 387, DTRAF1 (Δ1–124), was amplified by PCR as described above and subcloned into pGilda, which produces fusion proteins with an N-terminalLexA DNA binding domain. For GST fusion protein production, pGEX plasmids were transformed into competent XL-1 blue bacteria cells and grown in LB medium. GST-protein production was induced at anA 600 = 1.0 with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. Cells were then recovered and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme and lysed by sonication. The GST-DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) protein was purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resins were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmdithiothreitol until the A 280 nm reached <0.01. In vitro GST-protein binding assays were performed as described (9.Leo E.

Briefly, [35S]methionine-labeled TRAF proteins were produced byin vitro translation using the transcription/translation-coupled reticulocyte system following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Inc.). Equal amounts of each labeled protein (2–6 μl of lysate) were diluted with 250 μl of binding buffer (142 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a mixture of other protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubated with the GST-protein resins (0.5 μg of protein immobilized on 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resins were then extensively washed with binding buffer, and the GST-protein binding complexes were eluted with buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mmglutathione, followed by analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. For NFκB reporter gene assays, 293T cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate method and a total of 12 μg of plasmid DNA (including 0.5 μg of pUC13–4xNFκB-luc plasmid and 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid) at ≈50% confluency in 6-well plates in duplicate. After 36 h, cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of Promega lysis buffer. The luciferase activity of 10 μl of each cell lysate was determined using the luciferase assay system from Promega following the manufacturer's protocol and measured using a luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Luciferase activity was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity (32.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). ADrosophila gene encoding a protein homologous to the mammalian TRAF family was identified by searching the public data bases. The full-length Drosophila TRAF (DTRAF) cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from 0–4-hDrosophila embryos (23.Brown N.H. Kafatos F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This DTRAF cDNA was contained within a unique exon located in the Drosophila chromosome 2L (24F1–24F2) and encoded a predicted protein of 387 amino acids in length. The AUG that initiates this open reading frame is present within a favorable context for translation (39.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). DTRAF contains seven zinc finger domains in its N-terminal region, followed by a TRAF domain located near the C terminus of the molecule. Thus, the domain topology of DTRAF is similar to other previously identified mammalian TRAF proteins (Fig. 1). In contrast to many TRAFs, however, DTRAF does not contain a RING finger domain, and no evidence of a coiled-coil region upstream of the TRAF domain was found. Recently, a fly TRAF homologue was isolated based on its ability to interact with the Ste20 kinase Msn in a yeast two-hybrid screen (40.Liu H. Su Y.-C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This Drosophila TRAF appears to be the same protein as ours, except that it contains an additional 99 amino acids located at the N terminus of the protein, suggesting that our protein and DTRAF1 arise from a common gene. Using computer data base searches, we have also identified TRAF proteins in C. elegans and in Arabidopsis (Fig.2). The C. elegans TRAF contains a RING finger domain and five zinc fingers domains at the N terminus of the protein in addition to the TRAF domain at the C terminus. The Arabidopsis TRAF protein described here is an example of a family of hypothetical proteins containing TRAF domains found in Arabidopsis thaliana. Contrary to the other known TRAF proteins, the TRAF domain is located in the N terminus of this protein. The Arabidopsis TRAF protein does not contain either RING or zinc finger domains. A schematic representation of these new TRAF proteins is presented in Fig. 2 along with sequence alignments of the TRAF domains of the human and nonmammalian TRAF proteins. The predicted amino acid sequence of DTRAF1 is most similar to TRAF4 (47% identity) among the TRAFs (Fig. 2 A), both when considering only the homology within the TRAF domain and when evaluating the entire molecule. The predicted amino acid sequenceC. elegans TRAF shares similar extents of similarity with TRAF3, TRAF4, and TRAF5 (36 to 37% identity). ArabidopsisTRAF was most similar to TRAF3 (25% identity). A phylogenetic-tree analysis illustrating the theoretical evolutionary distances of these TRAF proteins is shown in Fig. 2 C. The sequences corresponding to the TRAF domains of DTRAF1, C. elegans TRAF, Arabidopsis TRAF, andDictyostelium TRAF (41.Regnier C. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M. Wendling C. Basset P. Rio M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were threaded onto the recently published x-ray crystal structure of human TRAF2 (42.Park Y. Burkitt V. Villa A. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 43.McWhirter S. Pullen S. Holton J. Crute J. Kehry M. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8408-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, all of these TRAFs from lower organisms adopted the same overall fold as the TRAF domain of human TRAF2. To investigate whether DTRAF1 can interact with the cytosolic domains of various members of the TNFR family, GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of CD40, p75NGFR, LTβR, and DR4 were tested for their ability to bind an in vitro translated35S-labeled DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) fragment that included the TRAF domain (Fig. 4 A). DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) specifically bound to the cytosolic tail (ct) of p75NGFR and more weakly to LTβR(ct). This pattern of binding is similar to that of TRAF4, which also binds specifically to these two members of the TNFR family in vitro (26.Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Van Arsdale T. Gascoyne R.D. Berern K. McFadden D. Shabaik A. Hugh J. Reynolds C. Clevenger C.V. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1549-1561PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the more extensive sequence similarity of DTRAF1 with TRAF4. Next, we studied the ability of the GST-DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) fusion protein to interact with the six known human TRAFs and to itself (Fig.4 B). DTRAF1 bound to TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF4, whereas no binding was detected to TRAF3, TRAF5, or TRAF6. Also, DTRAF was able to self-associate, similar to other TRAF family proteins (42.Park Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11830-11845Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Another type of protein that has been shown to interact with the TRAF domain of TRAF2 is IAP-family proteins, specifically cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 (44.Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). IAP family proteins are involved in regulating cell death by direct inhibition of caspases (47.Deveraux Q. Reed J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Two members of this family have been identified in Drosophila (48.Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Using the same approach described above, we investigated the ability of the TRAF domain of DTRAF1 to interact with all known human members of the IAP family as well as baculovirus CpIAP and the two Drosophila IAPs, DIAP-1 and DIAP-2 (Fig. 4 C). DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) interacted with human cIAP-1 and weakly with cIAP-2. In contrast, none of the other IAPs tested, including DIAP-1 and DIAP-2, bound to DTRAF1. Thus, DTRAF1 may not be a regulator of IAPs in Drosophila, although it evidently shares structural features in common with TRAF2 that permit binding to cIAP-1 and cIAP-2. Mammalian TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 induce NF-kB activation when overexpressed in cells. To investigate if DTRAF1 has a role in regulating NFκB activity, we overexpressed DTRAF1 and the deletion mutants DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) and DTRAF1 (Δ1–226) in human epithelial 293T cells, together with a NFκB-responsive reporter plasmid. None of these proteins induced significant NFκB activity in this cell line (Fig. 5 A). However, when DTRAF1 was co-transfected with TRAF6, a clear increase in NFκB activity was detected as compared with the levels of NFκB activity generated by TRAF6 alone. In contrast, co-transfection of TRAF6 with the DTRAF1 deletion mutants dramatically reduced TRAF6-mediated NFκB (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, co-expression of TRAF2 with either full-length DTRAF1 or the deletion mutants resulted in an inhibition of the TRAF2-mediated NFκB induction (Fig. 5 A). The levels of expression of these proteins in 293T cells after transfection were examined by immunoblotting, revealing that DTRAF(Δ1–124) did not alter the levels of TRAF2 or TRAF6 (Fig. 5 B). Since DTRAF1 binds TRAF2 but not TRAF6 in vitro, these data suggest that full-length DTRAF1 may interfere with TRAF2 function through direct interaction. In contrast, the effects of DTRAF1 on TRAF6 are presumably indirect, perhaps reflecting an interaction of DTRAF1 with signal transducing proteins downstream of TRAF6. Although TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 have been shown to activate NFκB via the kinases NFκB-inducing kinase and receptor interacting protein (49.McCarthy J. Ni J. Dixit V. J. Biol.

Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). IRAK is the human counterpart of the Drosophila kinase Pelle and mediates signal transduction by the Toll/interleukin 1 receptor family. In Drosophila, the transmembrane receptor signaling by Toll is mediated by two proteins, Tube and Pelle, the latter representing the Drosophila counterpart of mammalian IRAK kinase (36.Galindo R.L. Edwards D.N. Gillespie S.K. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1995; 121: 2209-2218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the TRAF domain of DTRAF1 can interact with components of the Drosophila Toll signal transduction pathway, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays (TableI). These two-hybrid experiments revealed a strong interaction of DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) with Pelle but not with Tube or Toll. The interaction of DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) with Pelle was mediated by the N-terminal regulatory domain of Pelle, which contains a death Domain (21.Schiffmann D.A. White J.H. Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Harding S.E. Jumel K. Solari R. Ray K.P. Gay N.J.

In vitro translated Pelle specifically bound to a GST-DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) fusion protein, whereas Tube did not.Table ISpecific interaction of DTRAF1 with PelleLex AB42−Leuβ-GalDTRAF1Pelle(1–501)++DTRAF1Tube−−DTRAF1Bax−−DTRAF1Ras−−DTRAF1Pelle(1–209)++DTRAF1Pelle(210–501)−−FasPelle(1–209)−−Pelle(1–209)DTRAF1++Pelle(1–209)Tube++Pelle(1–209)Bax−−Pelle(210–501)DTRAF1−−TollDTRAF1−−FasDTRAF1−−BaxDTRAF1−−Yeast strain EGY48 was transformed with yeast expression plasmids encoding various proteins expressed as fusions with either an N-terminal LexA DNA binding domain (left column) or B42 transactivation domain (right column).

The DTRAF1 plasmid used here encodes residues 125–387. Next, we explored whether DTRAF1 can regulate NFκB induction by Pelle. When expressed in HEK293T cells, neither Pelle nor any of the DTRAF1 constructs induced an increase in NFκB activity (Fig.7). However, when Pelle and DTRAF1 were co-transfected, a clear increase in NFκB activity was detected. This induction of NFκB was not observed when Pelle was co-transfected with DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) or DTRAF1 (Δ1–236), suggesting an important role for the zinc finger domains of DTRAF1 in this co-stimulatory effect. Moreover, both DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) and DTRAF1 (Δ1–236) were able to abrogate the induction of NFκB activity mediated by co-transfection of Pelle and DTRAF1, suggesting that these two DTRAF1 deletion mutants function in a dominant negative fashion (Fig. 7). The induction of NFκB activity in 293T cells by the combination of DTRAF1 and Pelle was specific in that reporter genes containing other promoters (e.g. p53-responsive; retinoid-responsive; androgen-responsive) were not affected (not shown). Altogether these results demonstrate that DTRAF1 is able to regulate NFκB activation in collaboration with Pelle, suggesting that DTRAF1 is a component of the Toll pathway in Drosophila. This pathway has been implicated in the regulation of the dorsal-ventral polarization of developing embryos. However, microinjection of DTRAF1 (Δ1–124) mRNA into Drosophila embryos failed to affect the normal dorsal-ventral patterning (not shown), suggesting that DTRAF1 may not be required for this developmental process. This observation, together with the recent characterization of another member of the TRAF family in Drosophila (40.Liu H. Su Y.-C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) implies that flies may contain other TRAF-family genes that create redundancy in the pathways available for NFκB induction, similar to the situation with mammalian TRAFs (9.Leo E. Welsh K. Matsuzawa S. Zapata J.M. Kitada S. Mitchell R. Ely K. Reed J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (22274): 22414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A role for DTRAF1 in innate immune responses to pathogens in flies, however, remains to be explored. In summary, we have identified cDNA sequences encoding TRAF domain proteins in Drosophila, C. elegans, Arabidopsis, and Dictyostelium. TheDrosophila TRAF homologue exhibits a variety of properties commonly observed in TRAF-family proteins of mammals including an ability to (a) associate with other TRAFs, (b) bind TNFR- and IAP-family proteins, (c) interact with IRAK-like kinases, and (d) modulate NF-kB activity. These findings suggest strong evolutionary conservation of the structure and function of vertebrate and invertebrate TRAFs. The finding of TRAF-like proteins in mammalians, invertebrates, plants, and slime mold suggests that TRAF domains represent an ancient component of the innate immune response."

Such tissue factor expression in an oxygen deficient environment is driven by the transcription factor Early Growth Response (Egr)-1.

These data firmly establish PKCβ as a trigger for events leading to induction of Egr-1 and tissue factor under hypoxic conditions, and provide insight into a biologic cascade whereby oxygen deprivation recruits targets of PKCβ and Egr-1, thereby amplifying the cellular response.

The best characterized mechanism triggering biosynthetic adaptation to oxygen deprivation involves the transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)1 (2.Semenza G. Trends Cardiovasc.

In a highly complementary manner, increased levels of erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor expand oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and, over time, enhance ingrowth of vessels to sites of hypoxemia, respectively (2.Semenza G.

Another facet of the biosynthetic response to hypoxia concerns expression of oxygen-regulated proteins (ORPs), which occurs within the first 48 h of hypoxia (8.Heacock C. Sutherland R. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1986; 12: 1287-1290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ORPs comprise a group of polypeptides whose members overlap with glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs), such as GRP78 and GRP94 (18.Wynn R. David J. Cox R. Chuang D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 124: 31-36PubMed Google Scholar), well known for their role as chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Studies of ORP150, a recently described member of this group cloned from hypoxic astrocytes (19.Kuwabara K. Matsumoto M. Ikeda J. Hori O. Ogawa S. Maeda Y. Kitagawa K. Imuta N. Kinoshita T. Stern D.

These data indicate that ER stress, likely due to accumulation of incompletely folded/misfolded proteins in the ER, as energy depletion and changes in protein biosynthesis impair normal protein processing, is an important feature of the intracellular milieu in hypoxia. Our recent studies have highlighted a quite distinct pathway triggered by oxygen deprivation. Hypoxia causes transcriptional activation of tissue factor, the key procoagulant cofactor that initiates the coagulation mechanism resulting, ultimately, in vascular fibrin formation (6.Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21.Lawson C.

Increased tissue factor in hypoxemic vasculature is especially evident in mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) (6.Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21.Lawson C. Yan S.-D. Yan S.-F. Liao H. Zhou Y.-S. Sobel J. Kisiel W. Stern D. Pinsky D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Further analysis of this pathway showed that induction of tissue factor expression resulted from up-regulation of the transcription factor Early Growth Response (Egr)-1 (22.Yan S.-D. Lu J. Zou Y.-S. Soh-Won J. Cohen D. Buttrick P. Cooper D. Steinberg S. Mackman N. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15030-15040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For example, homozygous Egr-1 null mice subjected to hypoxia did not display either enhanced tissue factor expression or vascular fibrin deposition. As fibrin accumulation in vessels subject to hypoxemia could have far-reaching pathophysiological consequences (23.Geerts W. Code K. Jay R. Chen E. Szalai J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 24.Anderson F. Wheeler H. Goldberg R. Hosmer D. Patwardhan N. Jovanovic B. Forcier A. Dalen J. Arch. Intern. Med. 1991; 151: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar) and increased levels of Egr-1 could recruit multiple other target genes, we have performed further studies to elucidate mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation of Egr-1 in response to oxygen deprivation. Our first studies using cultured cell lines suggested that events leading to Egr-1 expression could be traced back to protein kinase C isoform βII (PKCβII) (22.Yan S.-D. Lu J. Zou Y.-S. Soh-Won J. Cohen D. Buttrick P. Cooper D. Steinberg S. Mackman N. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15030-15040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because of the complex array of PKC isoforms and their overlapping properties, as well as the likelihood that results in established cell lines subject to transient transfection with multiple expression constructs would not faithfully model all aspects of the in vivo milieu, we have turned to experiments in genetically manipulated mice. In this regard, mice deficient in the PKCβ gene (since PKCβI and PKCβII isoforms are encoded by the same gene, these mice are deficient in both) have been produced by homologous recombination (termed PKCβ null mice) (25.Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The phenotype of these animals includes immunologic abnormalities, impaired humoral immune responses and reduced cellular responses to B cells, similar to those observed in X-linked immunodeficiency, although survival, reproductive status, and other general properties of these mice appear to be intact. Using PKCβ null animals, we have established a central role for PKCβ in the pathway triggered by hypoxia leading to activation of Egr-1 and tissue factor expression, and resulting in fibrin deposition in lung vasculature. These studies delineate a new facet of the response to oxygen deprivation, distinct from HIF-1, which is likely to initiate a complex pattern of biosynthetic changes in hypoxic/hypoxemic environments. Experiments employing mice subjected to hypoxia were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University, in accordance with the Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines. Homozygous PKCβ null mice were prepared as described (25.Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Both PKCβ null and wild-type controls (12–15 weeks old) were in a similar mixed background (129xC57BL6). However, since the 129 strain actually comprises a collection of genetically heterogeneous substrains, it is more than likely that the control mice (which were most likely derived from a different strain wild-type embryonic stem cell than the PKCβ null mice) are not genetically identical to the knockout mice. Mice were subjected to normobaric hypoxia (n = 5 per experimental condition unless indicated otherwise) for the indicated times by the regulated addition of nitrogen to a chamber equipped with circulating fans, carbon dioxide and ammonia elimination systems, and an on-line oxygen sensor (Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) (6.Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The environment within the chamber (including temperature and humidity) was regulated by a custom-built interface (K+K Interface Inc., New York, NY), which used a computer-driven environmental control program. Mice placed in the chamber in their usual cages were allowed free access to food and water, and the system parameters were adjusted to a final oxygen concentration of 5.5–6.5%. Mice exposed to hypoxia were tachypneic and had reduced activity, compared with normoxic counterparts, but there was no mortality during the experimental period. At the indicated times, animals were sacrificed, and tissues were studied as described below. Cells were subjected to hypoxia using an environmental chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI), which maintained a controlled temperature (37 °C), an humidified atmosphere with carbon dioxide (5%) and the balance made up of nitrogen. Use of this chamber for cultured cells has been described previously (6.Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The pH of the medium remained unchanged throughout experiments; pO2 in the medium was ≈12–14 torr (oxygen leached continuously from the tissue culture plasticware during the course of the experiments). The glucose concentration fell by less than 10–20% during the longest experimental time points (4 h; this degree of glucose depletion does not induce changes in gene expression described below). Exposure of cultured MPs to hypoxia (see below) did not alter cell viability, as assessed by: (i) lack of increased release of intracellular markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase; (ii) continued exclusion of trypan blue; (iii) continued protein synthesis (see below); and (iv) continued cell adherence to the substrate. Cells subjected to hypoxia were exposed to medium pre-equilibrated with the hypoxic gas mixture just prior to placement in the environmental chamber. Thus, cultures were immediately immersed in the oxygen-deprived environment at the time of medium change/placement in the chamber. Following hypoxia, mice were sacrificed and tissue was processed immediately. For Northern analysis, tissue was cut into small pieces, immersed in Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and homogenized, and total RNA was extracted and subjected to electrophoresis (0.8% agarose). RNA was transferred to Duralon-UV membranes (Stratagene), and membranes were then hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe for mouse Egr-1 (26.Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tissue factor (6.Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), or GLUT1 (27.Loike J. Cao L. Brett J. Ogawa S. Silverstein S. Stern D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C326-C333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were also hybridized with32P-labeled β-actin as an internal control for RNA loading. For Western blotting of Egr-1, nuclear extracts were prepared (see below), and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%; nonreduced). Proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotting was performed with rabbit anti-Egr-1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the Blotto procedure (28.Johnson D. Gautsch J. Sportsman J. Elder J. Gene Anal. Tech. 1984; 1: 3-8Crossref Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Sites of primary antibody binding were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Final detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting system (Amersham). A similar strategy was utilized to detect ERK1/2, except that an extract of total cell protein was employed, and anti-MAPK IgG (reactive with ERK1/2 regardless of phosphorylation status; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or anti-active MAPK IgG (1:5000 dilution; the latter selective for phosphorylated ERK1/2; Promega) was used as the primary antibody (29.Seger R. Krebs E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar, 30.Cano E. Mahadevan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting of tissue samples for fibrin, lung was harvested from animals treated with heparin (10 units/g, resulting in an activated partial thromboplastin time >300 s) prior to sacrifice (21.Lawson C. Yan S.-D. Yan S.-F. Liao H. Zhou Y.-S. Sobel J. Kisiel W. Stern D. Pinsky D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Tissue was placed in buffer (0.05 m Tris, 0.15m NaCl, 500 units/ml heparin; final pH 7.6) on ice and homogenized. Plasmin digestion was performed by a modification of the method of Francis (31.Francis C. Marder V. Martin S. Blood. 1980; 56: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by adding human plasmin (0.32 units/ml, Sigma) and incubating the sample for 6 h at 37 °C. This was followed by addition of more plasmin (0.32 units/ml) and additional incubation for 2 h, followed by centrifugation (2,300 × gfor 15 min), and aspiration of the supernatant. Samples of plasmin-treated hypoxic and normoxic lung homogenates (200 μg of total protein) were boiled in reducing SDS-sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%; reduced). Samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were reacted with rabbit anti-fibrin antibody made to γ-γ chain cross-links (21.Lawson C. Yan S.-D. Yan S.-F. Liao H.

Res. 1981; 23: 103-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), followed by affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Final detection of the bands was as above. For immunocytochemical studies, lung tissue was harvested, cut into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) to remove blood, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin (6.Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22.Yan S.-D. Lu J.

Sections were first stained with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-Egr-1 IgG (8 μg/ml; Santa Cruz), rat F4/80 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml; Caltag Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), rabbit anti-tissue factor IgG (63 μg/ml) (21.Lawson C.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:500 dilution; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), or rabbit anti-fibrin antibody (4 μg/ml). Then, they were incubated with secondary antibody, an affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-rat IgG (Sigma). The electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay was performed on nuclear extracts prepared immediately after harvest of the hypoxic lung by the method of Dignam et al. (33.Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for Egr (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were 5′ end-labeled with [32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and standard procedures. Binding reactions were performed as described (34.Yan S.-F. Tritto I. Pinsky D.J. Liao H. May L. Stern D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and samples (5 μg of protein in each lane) were loaded directly onto nondenaturing polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide (6%) gels prepared in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA). Gels were pre-run for 20 min before samples were loaded, and electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 1.5–2 h at 200 V. For competition studies, an 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probes for either Egr (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Sp1 (Promega) was added. Resident peritoneal MPs were harvested from PKCβ null and wild-type mice by lavage with ice-cold medium (35.McCarron R. Goroff D. Luhr J. Murphy M. Herscowitz H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 108: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in culture in complete medium (RPMI 1640 with fetal calf serum (10%)) for 24 h and then serum-starved for the next 24 h prior to placement in the hypoxic environment. Then, cultured MPs were subjected to hypoxia for 4 h or were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml; Escherichia coli serotype 026B6; Sigma) for 6 h or to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml; Sigma) for 1 h. RT-PCR for tissue factor transcripts was performed using the following primers: 5′ -TTGATGTGGAAGAAGGAGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGAATCAAAGCGTTAGC-3′ (antisense). The size of the amplified DNA fragment was 416 base pairs, and it was also identified by Southern blotting with a 32P-labeled fragment from the murine cDNA for tissue factor (322 base pairs), which did not contain the region included in the tissue factor primers. Other experiments were performed with a line of rat alveolar macrophages (NR8383) obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in Ham's F12K containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. NR8383 cells were incubated with the specific PKCβ inhibitor LY379196 (36.Braiman L. Sheffi-Friedman L. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 37.Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) alone, or in the presence of LPS or an hypoxic environment. Total RNA was isolated and either subjected to Northern analysis using 32P-labeled cDNA probes for Egr-1, GLUT1, or β-actin. Where indicated, autoradiograms were scanned with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IICX linked to a Macintosh G3 computer, and images were quantitated and compared using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). In a previous study, hypoxia was shown to induce Egr-1 expression and Egr-1-dependent transcription of tissue factor (22.Yan S.-D. Lu J. Zou Y.-S. Soh-Won J. Cohen D. Buttrick P. Cooper D. Steinberg S. Mackman N. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15030-15040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether PKCβ might participate in upstream events leading to Egr-1 up-regulation, PKCβ null mice were subjected to oxygen deprivation and Egr-1 expression was compared with that observed in age- and strain-matched controls. Wild-type mice demonstrated strong up-regulation of transcripts for Egr-1 mRNA in the lung within 30 min of exposure to the environment with 6% oxygen (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2; ≈16-fold increase in intensity of the band in samples from hypoxic lung compared with normoxic controls). In contrast, PKCβ null mice subjected to hypoxia for the same time showed only a weak increase in Egr-1 transcripts (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4; ≈1.6-fold increase in hypoxia compared with normoxia). Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts from hypoxic lung confirmed that increased amounts of Egr-1 antigen were present in samples from wild-type mice after 30 min, compared with normoxic controls (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and2). In fact, the rapidity of the rise in Egr-1 antigen suggests that even post-translational mechanisms related to protein stabilization might also be involved. Analogous to the lower levels of Egr-1 mRNA in PKCβ null mice, the knockouts showed an immunoreactive band of low intensity after exposure to hypoxia (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 4),versus the robust response in wild-type mice. In hypoxic lung from wild-type mice, Egr-1 antigen was especially evident in smooth muscle cells and in mononuclear phagocytes (Fig. 1 D;panel C shows Egr-1 immunostaining in the normoxic control). Staining of adjacent sections with F4/80 demonstrated colocalization of this murine monocyte marker (Fig.1 F) in cells expressing Egr-1 (Fig. 1 E). The PKCβ null mice showed only low levels of Egr-1 antigen in lungs of normoxic and hypoxic mice (Fig. 1, G and H). Gel shift analysis of nuclear extracts from lungs of wild-type mice using32P-labeled consensus oligonucleotide probe for Egr demonstrated a gel shift band whose intensity increased strongly in response to hypoxia (Fig. 1 I, lanes 2and 3). Nuclear binding activity was sequence-specific, based on competition with excess unlabeled Egr probe, but not unlabeled oligonucleotide probe for Sp1 (data not shown). When PKCβ null mice were exposed to hypoxia, the intensity of the gel shift band from nuclear extracts of lung increased minimally compared with normoxia (Fig. 1 I, lanes 4 and 5). These data demonstrate that deletion of the PKCβ gene strongly inhibits signaling events in the lung leading to induction of Egr-1. The small residual increase in Egr-1 in PKCβ null mice was not reproducible (often being similar to normoxic controls) and, thus, was difficult to characterize further. In a cultured monocyte-like cell line, we had observed previously that hypoxia caused translocation of PKCβII to the membranous fraction and autophosphorylation, and closely correlated with events leading to Egr-1 expression by a pathway that involved activation of MAP kinases ERK1/2 (22.Yan S.-D. Lu J. Zou Y.-S. Soh-Won J. Cohen D. Buttrick P. Cooper D. Steinberg S. Mackman N. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15030-15040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This led us to examine whether activation of ERK1/2 occurred in hypoxic lung, and if this would be altered in PKCβ null mice. Wild-type mice were exposed to hypoxia for 10 min, and lung homogenates were prepared for immunoblotting with antibody specific for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (29.Seger R. Krebs E.

https://openalex.org/W2083059050,"The products of proinflammatory genes such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) initiate many of the events associated with sepsis. Transcription of these genes is subsequently down-regulated, whereas expression of anti-inflammatory genes such as secretory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1 RA) is maintained. Differential expression is associated with endotoxin tolerance, a cellular phenomenon common to sepsis and characterized by reduced proinflammatory gene expression after repeated exposure to lipopolysaccharide. As a model for endotoxin tolerance, we examined the expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA in a human promonocyte cell line, THP-1. We observed a 5-fold decrease in COX-2 protein in endotoxin-tolerant cells relative to control cells. In contrast, sIL-1 RA protein increased 5-fold in control and tolerant cells and remained elevated. Decreased COX-2 production is due to repressed transcription and not enhanced mRNA degradation. In addition, COX-2 protein is turned over rapidly. Transcription of sIL-1 RA is also repressed during tolerance. However, sIL-1 RA mRNA is degraded more slowly than COX-2 mRNA, allowing continued synthesis of sIL-1 RA protein that is very stable. These results indicate that differential expression during endotoxin tolerance occurs by transcriptional repression of COX-2 and by protein and mRNA stabilization of sIL-1 RA.

Grosso-Wilmoth L. LaRue K. Guzman R. Cousart S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is a disease characterized by acute disseminated intravascular inflammation with multiple organ failure and hypotension due to infection by various bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Gram-negative bacterial infections are the most common causative agent of septic shock (2.Bone R.C. Moellering Jr., R.C. Infectious Disease Clinics of America. 5. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 739-753Google Scholar). Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, is a potent inducer of monocyte, macrophage and polymorphonuclear leukocyte inflammatory gene expression during infection and a common inducer of septic shock (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).COX-2 is a 70-kDa dimeric inducible enzyme that has a vital role in modulating inflammation through production of prostaglandin H2, a precursor of several potent eicosanoid mediators (4.Inoue H.

Shock. 1998; 9: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression is clearly associated with proinflammatory activity in inflammatory diseases and the COX-2 gene responds like other proinflammatory genes during sepsis (6.Shoup M. He L.K. Liu H. Shankar R. Gamelli R. J. Trauma. 1998; 45: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.Ogura S. Umegaki O. Genovese F. Fernando L.P. Cochran J.B. Romeo C.M. Cook J.A. Shock. 1999; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The induction of proinflammatory genes such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and COX-2 by bacterial products such as LPS is essential and necessary to initiate the septic response (2.Bone R.C. Moellering Jr., R.C. Infectious Disease Clinics of America. 5. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 739-753Google Scholar). However, these genes are rapidly and continuously down-regulated soon after the sepsis syndrome is initiated (2.Bone R.C. Moellering Jr., R.C. Infectious Disease Clinics of America. 5. W. B.

Kafferlein E. Keiper D. Petersmann L. Endres S. Flegel W.A. Northoff H. Riethmuller G. Haas J.G. Immunology. 1992; 75: 264-268PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to COX-2, regulatory factors, such as secretory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1 RA) (10.Arend W.P. Smith M.F. Janson R. Joslin F. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar), serve to neutralize the activity and overproduction of inflammatory defenses (11.Smith M. Eidlen D. Arend W. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3584-3593PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Porreca E. Reale R. Febbo C.D. Gioacchino M.D. Barbacane R. Castellani M. Baccante G. Conti P. Cuccurullo F. Immunology. 1996; 89: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Anti-inflammatory genes such as interleukin-1 type II receptor (IL-1 R2), IL-10, and sIL-1 RA are also induced early in sepsis. However, the products encoded by anti-inflammatory genes are persistently elevated during the course of sepsis (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar).In 1947, Beeson first documented that cells exposed to LPS become refractory to further challenge with this stimulus, a process termed “endotoxin tolerance” (14.Beeson P. J. Exp. Med. 1947; 86: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This adaptive response to LPS is a cellular phenomenon that is associated with reduced levels of inflammatory mediators after a second exposure to LPS when compared with the levels induced by an initial exposure. Adaptation to stimulation by LPS is thought to have evolved as a mechanism to down-regulate the continuous and often injurious inflammatory response the immune system sustains during severe sepsis, presumably to reduce the potentially lethal autotoxic effects brought about by overproduction of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and COX-2 (1.McCall C. Grosso-Wilmoth L. LaRue K. Guzman R. Cousart S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This differential expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes leads to a state of immunosuppression. Although adaptation to LPS is protective against the potentially autotoxic effects of LPS when it exists prior to initiation, its presence during sepsis can compromise innate immunity (15.Olszyna D.P. Prins J.M. Buis B. Van Deventer S.J.H. Speelman P. Van Der Poll T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66 (2534): 3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). sIL-1 RA protein is expressed at persistently elevated levels in patients suffering from sepsis, while COX-2, IL-1β, and TNF-α protein levels are decreased, thus prolonging an immunosuppressed state (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar, 16.DeBont E. DeLeij L. Okken A. Baarsma R. Kimpen J. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17.Fisher C.J. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, it is unclear how the differential regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes occurs.THP-1 cells respond to repeated exposure to LPS in a fashion similar to leukocytes obtained from patients with sepsis, exhibiting repressed IL-1β and TNF-α expression (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Suppression of these genes is under the control of a labile protein(s) (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, THP-1 cells were used to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the differential expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA in endotoxin tolerance.DISCUSSIONIn endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells, the level of COX-2 protein is decreased, whereas the level of sIL-1 RA protein is not. This differential expression results from repressed transcription of both COX-2 and sIL-1 RA genes combined with stabilization of sIL-1 RA protein and mRNA. The mechanism(s) that decrease transcription and stabilize protein and mRNA in tolerant cells are not yet known, but may involve a labile repressor(s) of transcription as well as protein and mRNA stabilizing/destabilizing elements (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24.Ziegler-Heitbrock H. Wedel A. Schraut W. Strobel M. Wendelgass P. Sternsdorf T. Bauerle P. Haas J. Riethmuller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17001-17004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting steady state mRNA levels are amplified at the level of protein with dramatic differences in COX-2 and sIL-1 RA expression in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells.Given the observation that COX-2 and sIL-1 RA were differentially expressed at the protein level, we examined their transcriptional regulation in THP-1 cells. COX-2 promoter fragments exhibit 3–5.5-fold decreases in reporter gene activity in transient transfection assays (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, transcription of the endogenous COX-2 gene exhibits an equivalent decrease in tolerant cells upon stimulation with LPS in comparison to control cells (data not shown). Based on these data and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B), we find that COX-2 transcription is induced early and then quickly repressed. In addition, PGE2 lipid levels are decreased approximately 3-fold in tolerant cells when compared to control cells stimulated with LPS, possibly due to lower levels of COX-2 protein or available substrate present in tolerant cells. Similar to COX-2, sIL-1 RA transcription is also markedly reduced in tolerant cells (Fig. 4 B). This transcriptional repression may involve negative regulatory element(s) similar to those required for silencer activity in interferon-A gene promoters (25.Lopez S. Reeves R. Island M.-L. Bandu M.-T. Christeff N. Doly J. Navarro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22788-22799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with repressed transcription of the two genes, possibly by the same type of labile repressor that is thought to act on IL-1β (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The large increase in sIL-1 RA protein in the presence of repressed transcriptional activity and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 A) indicates that other regulatory mechanisms must contribute to the elevated protein levels in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells. We propose two potential mechanisms. First, differences in mRNA stability may account for the increase in sIL-1 RA protein levels in tolerant cells. Second, enhanced translational efficiency of declining pools of mRNA may potentiate sIL-1 RA expression in tolerance. We believe that it most likely is a combination of these two potential mechanisms. In support of this notion, Cassatella (26.Cassatella M. Meda L. Gasperini S. Calzetti F. Bonora S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) has shown that anti-inflammatory IL-10 up-regulates IL1-RA production in LPS-stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes by delaying mRNA degradation. We have also shown that delaying mRNA degradation in THP-1 cells tolerant to IL-1β overcomes repression of IL-1β synthesis (27.Yoza B.K. Wells J.D. McCall C.E. Clin. Diag. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies and others (28.Colotta F. Saccani S. Giri J. Dower M. Sims J. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that increased anti-inflammatory expression may result from positive feedback mechanisms that are in place to help counterbalance proinflammatory expression. In addition, Beutler (29.Beutler B. Brown T. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1336-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has shown that cis-acting elements from the 3′-untranslated region of TNF-α are required for efficient translational activation of the gene. A similar form of translational regulation by cis-acting elements within the IL-1 RA 3′-untranslated region is therefore plausible.Post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation have important roles in the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes (26.Cassatella M. Meda L. Gasperini S. Calzetti F. Bonora S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 29.Beutler B. Brown T. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1336-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was unknown whether similar mechanisms regulated COX-2 and sIL-1 RA expression. We investigated this issue by mRNA decay analysis. Our findings demonstrated that the turnover rate for the biphasic decay of COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 6 A) in tolerant cells (t 1/2 = 6 h) is 6 times as long as in control cells (t 1/2 = 1 h). In addition, we believe that even at lower levels in tolerant cells, COX-2 mRNA is efficiently translated (Fig. 1 A). The biphasic decay of COX-2 in control cells may be important in that elevated levels of proinflammatory mRNAs are rapidly turned over, whereas lower levels are subject to different turnover mechanisms and kinetics. Similarly, mRNA half-life analysis (Fig. 6 B) demonstrated that the turnover rate for sIL-1 RA in tolerant cells (t 1/2 = 12 h) is doubled in comparison to control cells (t 1/2 = 6 h), indicating that sIL-1 RA mRNA is relatively stable in tolerant cells. This mRNA stability may permit continued translation of sIL-1 RA. Additionally, mRNA stabilization may serve as a general mechanism of regulating expression for certain pro- and anti-inflammatory genes, potentially as a negative feedback loop (i.e. COX-2) or as means for continued expression (i.e. sIL-1 RA). Brooks et al. have shown that IL-1-induced JunB mRNA levels are not directly correlated with the level of JunB protein synthesis (30.Brooks J.W. Yoza B.K. Mizel S.B. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Rather, JunB protein levels remain elevated as a result of enhanced translational efficiency. Our findings with sIL-1 RA in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells are consistent with this mechanism. In addition, Cassatella and others have shown that the sIL-1 RA 3′-untranslated region does not contain AU-rich destabilizing sequences that are characteristic of rapidly turned over proinflammatory mRNA, such as COX-2 and IL-1 (26.Cassatella M. Meda L. Gasperini S. Calzetti F. Bonora S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 31.Kastelic T. Schnyder J. Leutwiler A. Traber R. Streit B. Niggli H. Mackenzie A. Cheneval D. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).With the data supporting the notion that mRNA stability may in part explain differential expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA, we investigated protein stability by half-life analysis. Protein levels for COX-2 in both control and tolerant cells reached 50% of their maximal level within 2 h of cycloheximide addition (Fig. 5 A). This relatively short turnover time for COX-2 is consistent with what is known for the rapid decay of proinflammatory proteins in vitro (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and their relative absence clinically in sepsis (17.Fisher C.J. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast, sIL-1 RA protein is very stable (Fig. 5 B). In both control and tolerant cells, sIL-1 RA protein is stable over 24 h. Interestingly, this stability is still maintained at 96 h (data not shown). These findings are supportive of clinical studies in sepsis in which anti-inflammatory protein levels remain elevated for several days (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar). Although elevated levels of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as sIL-1 RA, often help to decrease the potentially lethal inflammatory response in sepsis, the stability of these proteins may in part promote the severe immunosuppression commonly seen in sepsis patients.Taken collectively, these data are consistent with the notion that there is no significant difference in protein stability between control and endotoxin-tolerant cells for COX-2 or sIL-1 RA. However, the corresponding mRNAs are more stable in tolerant cells than in control cells, delaying degradation. In addition, due to undefined differences between pro- and anti-inflammatory genes, sIL-1 RA mRNA and protein are significantly more stable than those of COX-2, resulting in a pronounced difference at the level of protein in endotoxin tolerance.In summary, the results of this study demonstrate differential regulation and expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells. COX-2 protein levels are decreased, yet sIL-1 RA protein levels remain elevated. Differential expression is consistent with repressed transcription and protein turnover for COX-2, whereas sIL-1 RA mRNA and protein are stabilized. We believe that increased stability of sIL-1 RA mRNA may be coupled with enhanced translational efficiency of sIL-1 RA protein in tolerant cells. These data demonstrate that COX-2 and sIL-1 RA proteins are differentially expressed in endotoxin tolerant THP-1 cells, similar to differential expression observed during sepsis (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Fisher C.J. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the time courses for the THP-1 expression of COX-2 (rapid and transient) and sIL-1 RA (slow and constitutive) proteins are similar to the pattern of expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes observed during clinical sepsis (23.van der Poll T. Coyle S.M. Moldawer L.L. Lowry S.F. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the THP-1 cell line is as a useful system to dissect endotoxin responsiveness and the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. Our results not only establish mechanisms for the differential regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes and their protein products, but also serve as a foundation for future studies on the factors that are responsible for repressing and destabilizing COX-2 mRNA and protein and that promote sIL-1 RA expression. Severe sepsis with septic shock is the major cause of death in critical care units in the United States, killing over 100,000 people each year (1.McCall C. Grosso-Wilmoth L. LaRue K. Guzman R. Cousart S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is a disease characterized by acute disseminated intravascular inflammation with multiple organ failure and hypotension due to infection by various bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Gram-negative bacterial infections are the most common causative agent of septic shock (2.Bone R.C. Moellering Jr., R.C. Infectious Disease Clinics of America. 5. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 739-753Google Scholar). Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, is a potent inducer of monocyte, macrophage and polymorphonuclear leukocyte inflammatory gene expression during infection and a common inducer of septic shock (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). COX-2 is a 70-kDa dimeric inducible enzyme that has a vital role in modulating inflammation through production of prostaglandin H2, a precursor of several potent eicosanoid mediators (4.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar,5.Durando M. Fernando L. Ashton S. Halushka P. Cook J. Shock. 1998; 9: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression is clearly associated with proinflammatory activity in inflammatory diseases and the COX-2 gene responds like other proinflammatory genes during sepsis (6.Shoup M. He L.K. Liu H. Shankar R. Gamelli R. J. Trauma. 1998; 45: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.Ogura S. Umegaki O. Genovese F. Fernando L.P. Cochran J.B. Romeo C.M. Cook J.A. Shock. 1999; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The induction of proinflammatory genes such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and COX-2 by bacterial products such as LPS is essential and necessary to initiate the septic response (2.Bone R.C. Moellering Jr., R.C. Infectious Disease Clinics of America. 5. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 739-753Google Scholar). However, these genes are rapidly and continuously down-regulated soon after the sepsis syndrome is initiated (2.Bone R.C. Moellering Jr., R.C. Infectious Disease Clinics of America. 5. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 739-753Google Scholar, 8.Zuckerman S. Evans G. Butler L. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2774-2780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Blumenstein M. Kafferlein E. Keiper D. Petersmann L. Endres S. Flegel W.A. Northoff H. Riethmuller G. Haas J.G. Immunology. 1992; 75: 264-268PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to COX-2, regulatory factors, such as secretory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1 RA) (10.Arend W.P. Smith M.F. Janson R. Joslin F. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar), serve to neutralize the activity and overproduction of inflammatory defenses (11.Smith M. Eidlen D. Arend W. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3584-3593PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Porreca E. Reale R. Febbo C.D. Gioacchino M.D. Barbacane R. Castellani M. Baccante G. Conti P. Cuccurullo F. Immunology. 1996; 89: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Anti-inflammatory genes such as interleukin-1 type II receptor (IL-1 R2), IL-10, and sIL-1 RA are also induced early in sepsis. However, the products encoded by anti-inflammatory genes are persistently elevated during the course of sepsis (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar). In 1947, Beeson first documented that cells exposed to LPS become refractory to further challenge with this stimulus, a process termed “endotoxin tolerance” (14.Beeson P. J. Exp. Med. 1947; 86: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This adaptive response to LPS is a cellular phenomenon that is associated with reduced levels of inflammatory mediators after a second exposure to LPS when compared with the levels induced by an initial exposure. Adaptation to stimulation by LPS is thought to have evolved as a mechanism to down-regulate the continuous and often injurious inflammatory response the immune system sustains during severe sepsis, presumably to reduce the potentially lethal autotoxic effects brought about by overproduction of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and COX-2 (1.McCall C. Grosso-Wilmoth L. LaRue K. Guzman R. Cousart S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This differential expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes leads to a state of immunosuppression. Although adaptation to LPS is protective against the potentially autotoxic effects of LPS when it exists prior to initiation, its presence during sepsis can compromise innate immunity (15.Olszyna D.P. Prins J.M. Buis B. Van Deventer S.J.H. Speelman P. Van Der Poll T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66 (2534): 3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). sIL-1 RA protein is expressed at persistently elevated levels in patients suffering from sepsis, while COX-2, IL-1β, and TNF-α protein levels are decreased, thus prolonging an immunosuppressed state (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar, 16.DeBont E. DeLeij L. Okken A. Baarsma R. Kimpen J. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17.Fisher C.J. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, it is unclear how the differential regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes occurs. THP-1 cells respond to repeated exposure to LPS in a fashion similar to leukocytes obtained from patients with sepsis, exhibiting repressed IL-1β and TNF-α expression (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Suppression of these genes is under the control of a labile protein(s) (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, THP-1 cells were used to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the differential expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA in endotoxin tolerance. DISCUSSIONIn endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells, the level of COX-2 protein is decreased, whereas the level of sIL-1 RA protein is not. This differential expression results from repressed transcription of both COX-2 and sIL-1 RA genes combined with stabilization of sIL-1 RA protein and mRNA. The mechanism(s) that decrease transcription and stabilize protein and mRNA in tolerant cells are not yet known, but may involve a labile repressor(s) of transcription as well as protein and mRNA stabilizing/destabilizing elements (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24.Ziegler-Heitbrock H. Wedel A. Schraut W. Strobel M. Wendelgass P. Sternsdorf T. Bauerle P. Haas J. Riethmuller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17001-17004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting steady state mRNA levels are amplified at the level of protein with dramatic differences in COX-2 and sIL-1 RA expression in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells.Given the observation that COX-2 and sIL-1 RA were differentially expressed at the protein level, we examined their transcriptional regulation in THP-1 cells. COX-2 promoter fragments exhibit 3–5.5-fold decreases in reporter gene activity in transient transfection assays (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, transcription of the endogenous COX-2 gene exhibits an equivalent decrease in tolerant cells upon stimulation with LPS in comparison to control cells (data not shown). Based on these data and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B), we find that COX-2 transcription is induced early and then quickly repressed. In addition, PGE2 lipid levels are decreased approximately 3-fold in tolerant cells when compared to control cells stimulated with LPS, possibly due to lower levels of COX-2 protein or available substrate present in tolerant cells. Similar to COX-2, sIL-1 RA transcription is also markedly reduced in tolerant cells (Fig. 4 B). This transcriptional repression may involve negative regulatory element(s) similar to those required for silencer activity in interferon-A gene promoters (25.Lopez S. Reeves R. Island M.-L. Bandu M.-T. Christeff N. Doly J. Navarro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22788-22799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with repressed transcription of the two genes, possibly by the same type of labile repressor that is thought to act on IL-1β (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The large increase in sIL-1 RA protein in the presence of repressed transcriptional activity and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 A) indicates that other regulatory mechanisms must contribute to the elevated protein levels in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells. We propose two potential mechanisms. First, differences in mRNA stability may account for the increase in sIL-1 RA protein levels in tolerant cells. Second, enhanced translational efficiency of declining pools of mRNA may potentiate sIL-1 RA expression in tolerance. We believe that it most likely is a combination of these two potential mechanisms. In support of this notion, Cassatella (26.Cassatella M. Meda L. Gasperini S. Calzetti F. Bonora S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) has shown that anti-inflammatory IL-10 up-regulates IL1-RA production in LPS-stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes by delaying mRNA degradation. We have also shown that delaying mRNA degradation in THP-1 cells tolerant to IL-1β overcomes repression of IL-1β synthesis (27.Yoza B.K. Wells J.D. McCall C.E. Clin. Diag. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies and others (28.Colotta F. Saccani S. Giri J. Dower M. Sims J. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2534-2541PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that increased anti-inflammatory expression may result from positive feedback mechanisms that are in place to help counterbalance proinflammatory expression. In addition, Beutler (29.Beutler B. Brown T. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1336-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has shown that cis-acting elements from the 3′-untranslated region of TNF-α are required for efficient translational activation of the gene. A similar form of translational regulation by cis-acting elements within the IL-1 RA 3′-untranslated region is therefore plausible.Post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation have important roles in the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes (26.Cassatella M. Meda L. Gasperini S. Calzetti F. Bonora S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 29.Beutler B. Brown T. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1336-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was unknown whether similar mechanisms regulated COX-2 and sIL-1 RA expression. We investigated this issue by mRNA decay analysis. Our findings demonstrated that the turnover rate for the biphasic decay of COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 6 A) in tolerant cells (t 1/2 = 6 h) is 6 times as long as in control cells (t 1/2 = 1 h). In addition, we believe that even at lower levels in tolerant cells, COX-2 mRNA is efficiently translated (Fig. 1 A). The biphasic decay of COX-2 in control cells may be important in that elevated levels of proinflammatory mRNAs are rapidly turned over, whereas lower levels are subject to different turnover mechanisms and kinetics. Similarly, mRNA half-life analysis (Fig. 6 B) demonstrated that the turnover rate for sIL-1 RA in tolerant cells (t 1/2 = 12 h) is doubled in comparison to control cells (t 1/2 = 6 h), indicating that sIL-1 RA mRNA is relatively stable in tolerant cells. This mRNA stability may permit continued translation of sIL-1 RA. Additionally, mRNA stabilization may serve as a general mechanism of regulating expression for certain pro- and anti-inflammatory genes, potentially as a negative feedback loop (i.e. COX-2) or as means for continued expression (i.e. sIL-1 RA). Brooks et al. have shown that IL-1-induced JunB mRNA levels are not directly correlated with the level of JunB protein synthesis (30.Brooks J.W. Yoza B.K. Mizel S.B. Mol.

Protein levels for COX-2 in both control and tolerant cells reached 50% of their maximal level within 2 h of cycloheximide addition (Fig. 5 A). This relatively short turnover time for COX-2 is consistent with what is known for the rapid decay of proinflammatory proteins in vitro (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1995; 32: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Rather, JunB protein levels remain elevated as a result of enhanced translational efficiency. Our findings with sIL-1 RA in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells are consistent with this mechanism. In addition, Cassatella and others have shown that the sIL-1 RA 3′-untranslated region does not contain AU-rich destabilizing sequences that are characteristic of rapidly turned over proinflammatory mRNA, such as COX-2 and IL-1 (26.Cassatella M. Meda L. Gasperini S. Calzetti F. Bonora S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 31.Kastelic T. Schnyder J. Leutwiler A. Traber R. Streit B. Niggli H. Mackenzie A. Cheneval D. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). With the data supporting the notion that mRNA stability may in part explain differential expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA, we investigated protein stability by half-life analysis. Protein levels for COX-2 in both control and tolerant cells reached 50% of their maximal level within 2 h of cycloheximide addition (Fig. 5 A). This relatively short turnover time for COX-2 is consistent with what is known for the rapid decay of proinflammatory proteins in vitro (3.LaRue K. McCall C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and their relative absence clinically in sepsis (17.Fisher C.J. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast, sIL-1 RA protein is very stable (Fig. 5 B). In both control and tolerant cells, sIL-1 RA protein is stable over 24 h. Interestingly, this stability is still maintained at 96 h (data not shown). These findings are supportive of clinical studies in sepsis in which anti-inflammatory protein levels remain elevated for several days (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar). Although elevated levels of anti-inflammatory proteins, such as sIL-1 RA, often help to decrease the potentially lethal inflammatory response in sepsis, the stability of these proteins may in part promote the severe immunosuppression commonly seen in sepsis patients. Taken collectively, these data are consistent with the notion that there is no significant difference in protein stability between control and endotoxin-tolerant cells for COX-2 or sIL-1 RA. However, the corresponding mRNAs are more stable in tolerant cells than in control cells, delaying degradation. In addition, due to undefined differences between pro- and anti-inflammatory genes, sIL-1 RA mRNA and protein are significantly more stable than those of COX-2, resulting in a pronounced difference at the level of protein in endotoxin tolerance. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate differential regulation and expression of COX-2 and sIL-1 RA in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells. COX-2 protein levels are decreased, yet sIL-1 RA protein levels remain elevated. Differential expression is consistent with repressed transcription and protein turnover for COX-2, whereas sIL-1 RA mRNA and protein are stabilized. We believe that increased stability of sIL-1 RA mRNA may be coupled with enhanced translational efficiency of sIL-1 RA protein in tolerant cells. These data demonstrate that COX-2 and sIL-1 RA proteins are differentially expressed in endotoxin tolerant THP-1 cells, similar to differential expression observed during sepsis (13.Rogy M.A. J. Am. Coll. Surg. 1994; 178: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Fisher C.J. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the time courses for the THP-1 expression of COX-2 (rapid and transient) and sIL-1 RA (slow and constitutive) proteins are similar to the pattern of expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes observed during clinical sepsis (23.van der Poll T. Coyle S.M. Moldawer L.L. Lowry S.F. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the THP-1 cell line is as a useful system to dissect endotoxin responsiveness and the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. Our results not only establish mechanisms for the differential regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes and their protein products, but also serve as a foundation for future studies on the factors that are responsible for repressing and destabilizing COX-2 mRNA and protein and that promote sIL-1 RA expression.

The basal expression of the proU operon is low, but it is rapidly induced when the bacteria are grown in media of high osmolarity (e.g. 0.3 m NaCl). It has previously been suggested that increased intracellular concentrations of K+-glutamate activate the proU promoter in response to increased extracellular osmolarity. We show here that the activation of the proU promoter by K+-glutamatein vitro is nonspecific, and the in vivoregulation cannot simply be mimicked in vitro. In vivospecificity requires both the chromatin-associated protein H-NS and the DRE; they are both needed to maintain repression of proU expression at low osmolarity. How H-NS and the DRE repress the proUpromoter in vivo has so far been unclear. We show that,in vivo, the DRE acts at a distance to inhibit open complex formation at the proU promoter.

How H-NS and the DRE repress the proUpromoter in vivo has so far been unclear. We show that,in vivo, the DRE acts at a distance to inhibit open complex formation at the proU promoter. downstream regulatory element polymerase chain reaction β-lactamase Escherichia coli and Salmonella must maintain an intracellular osmolarity that is greater than that of their environment, creating a tendency for water to enter the cells and generating an outward directed hydrostatic pressure or turgor. This turgor is essential for growth and division. A sudden increase in the osmolarity of the environment must be compensated for by an increase in the intracellular osmolarity. This adaptation is essentially a two-step process. First the concentration of K+-glutamate is increased by specific uptake systems for K+ and the rapid synthesis of glutamate. Subsequently the concentration of “osmoprotectants” such as glycine-betaine, trehalose, proline, or proline-betaine increases either by synthesis or uptake from the environment, followed by an efflux of K+-glutamate. High concentrations of osmoprotectants are less toxic to the cell than K+-glutamate. This series of events restores the turgor and enables the cell to grow in media with a high osmolarity. The proU operons of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium encode high affinity glycine-betaine uptake systems that are essential for cell survival in media of high osmolarity. The uptake systems for this major osmoprotectant only need to be active in media of high osmolarity. The synthesis of the ProU glycine-betaine uptake system is regulated, principally, at the level of transcription, and activity of the proU promoter is increased up to 100-fold by an increase in extracellular osmolarity (1.Cairney J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Dunlap V.J. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 296-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Gowrishankar J.

The mechanism by which transcription of the proU operon is induced at high osmolarity is still unclear. Two mechanisms have been proposed. In the simplest model, the elevated concentration of K+-glutamate is suggested to directly enhance transcription from the proU promoter (5.Prince W.S. Villarejo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17673-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ramirez R.M. Prince W.S. Bremer E. Villarejo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been shown that inin vitro transcription or transcription-translation systems elevated concentrations of K+-glutamate can increase transcription from the proU promoter (5.Prince W.S.

However, the binding of RNA polymerase to promoters that are not activated at high osmolarity is also increased dramatically by increased salt concentrations (9.Richey B. Cayley D.S. Mossing M.C.

We show here that increased open complex formation by RNA polymerase in direct response to intracellular K+-glutamate concentrations cannot provide the only signal regulating proU expression. In the second model, proU expression is regulated by a change in the topology of the DNA, requiring a change in the structure of a complex formed by the downstream regulatory element (DRE),1 the proUpromoter, and the chromatin-associated protein H-NS (12.Owen-Hughes T.A.

H-NS is an abundant “chromatin-associated” or “histone-like” protein involved in packaging of the DNA into the nucleoid that influences the regulation of the expression of approximately 60 genes (15.Ussery D.W. Hinton J.C.D. Jordi B.J.A.M. Granum P.E. Seirafi A. Stephen R.J. Tupper A.E. Berridge G. Sidebotham J.M. Higgins C.F.

DREs are newly described regulatory elements in bacteria, found downstream of promoters. They negatively regulate the activity of these promoters and work in conjunction with the histone-like protein H-NS. The DRE in the proU operon of E. coli andS. typhimurium was the first to be described and is required for repression of the proU promoter at low osmolarity and lies within the coding region of the first structural geneproV (25.Fletcher S.A. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4508-4513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Overdier D.G. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The DRE contains intrinsically curved DNA, but factors other than curvature are important for its function (27.Jordi B.J.A.M. Fielder A.E. Burns C.M. Hinton J.C.D. Dover N. Ussery D.W. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12083-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, DREs have been described in the operon encoding CS1 fimbriae and in the gene encoding the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) of Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains (28.Lucht J.M. Dersch P. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6578-6586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Murphree D. Froehlich B. Scott J.R. J.

In thebgl operon of E. coli sequences upstream and downstream of the promoter also inhibit promoter activity in conjunction with H-NS (31.Schnetz K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that the DREs act at the level of transcription initiation at a distance (12.Owen-Hughes T.A.

The fragment was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of vector pSB71 (Table II), upstream the luciferase genes. The resulting plasmid was called pBJ9. The 3-kilobase BamHI fragment of pBJ9 containing theproU promoter and the luciferase reporter genes was cloned into the BamHI site of plasmid pAV1990 (Table II) generating plasmid pBJ10. Sequencing confirmed that no PCR errors had been introduced. Standard methods were used for gel electrophoresis and the construction of recombinant plasmids (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The “pellets” were dissolved in 100 μl of 1% SDS and 1 ml of 1-butanol added, mixed, and centrifuged for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed. Dry pellets were dissolved in 10 μl of loading buffer (40% formamide, 5 m urea, 5 mm NaOH, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol). Maxam-Gilbert G chemical cleavage sequencing reactions, for use as size markers, were generated as described (36.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8984) Google Scholar). KMnO4 footprints were performed in 20 μl of H-NS binding buffer (see above) containing 0.1 pmol of plasmid DNA. RNA polymerase, H-NS, and K+-glutamate were added as indicated. Samples were incubated at 37 °C, and the KMnO4 footprint was performed as described above. After ethanol precipitation, the samples were dissolved in 10 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) instead of 100 μl of 10% piperidine. The site of KMnO4 attack was detected by primer extension essential as described (37.Burns H. Minchin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3840-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using primers proU −92 (5′-CATGGGAAATCACAGCCCGAT-3′) or β-lac+95 (5′-GGAAGGCAAAATGCCGCAAAAAAGG) for the proU and the β-lac promoters, respectively. Vent DNA Polymerase (2 units) (New England Biolabs) was used in the extension reaction. The primer extension reactions were precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 10 μl of loading buffer before electrophoresis (see above). In vivo KMnO4 footprints were performed essentially as described (38.Gralla J.D. Hsieh M. Wong C. Revzin A. Footprinting of Nucleic Acid-Protein Complexes. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 107-128Crossref Google Scholar). 40 ml of nutrient broth was inoculated with an overnight culture of E. coli strain DH5α containing the appropriate plasmid. At A 600 nmof 0.450, the cells were split into two halves, NaCl was added to 20 ml of cells to a final concentration of 0.3 m, and the cells were grown for a further 20 min. The culture was split into two halves again, and 40 μl of rifampicine (50 mg/ml in methanol) was added to 10 ml of cells, whereas the other 10 ml was left untreated. The cells were incubated for a further 5 min at 37 °C, and freshly prepared 200 mm KMnO4 solution (0.25 ml) was added to the cells to a final concentration of 5 mmKMnO4 and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, washed once in 10 ml of minimal medium, and harvested again, and plasmid DNA was purified as described (38.Gralla J.D. Hsieh M. Wong C. Revzin A. Footprinting of Nucleic Acid-Protein Complexes. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 107-128Crossref Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was dissolved in 100 μl of TE, and 10 μl of this plasmid solution was used in an extension reaction with radioactive primers as described (see above). KMnO4 footprints were used in an attempt to reconstitute regulation of the proU promoter in vitro. KMnO4 reacts with single-stranded DNA and can therefore be used as a reagent to measure open complex formation by RNA polymerase. The amount of open complex formation is a measure of promoter activity. First, we determined whether the repressive effect of H-NS can be mimicked in vitro. A linear DNA fragment containing theproU promoter from −217 to +225 (where +1 is the start of the transcription) was incubated with increasing amounts of purified H-NS protein for 15 min at 37 °C. This promoter fragment is shown to be sufficient to confer osmoregulation in vivo (12.Owen-Hughes T.A. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Next 2 units of RNA polymerase were added, and the incubation was continued for a further 15 min at 37 °C. KMnO4 footprints were performed as described for linear DNA fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”). These footprints indicated that 1.5 μg of H-NS was sufficient to inhibit the formation of open complex by RNA polymerase at the proU promoter. Thus, H-NS can repress the activity of the proU promoter in vitro, as it does in vivo at low osmolarity. To determine whether the repressive effects of H-NS can be overcome by increased concentrations of K+-glutamate, different amounts of K+-glutamate were added to the reaction mixture to final concentrations of 0, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mm. At 200, 300, and 400 mm K+-glutamate increased open complex formation was seen at the proU promoter (Fig.1). Thus, elevated K+-glutamate concentrations can overcome the repressive effect of H-NS at the proU promoter in vitro. To determine whether the effect was specific, similar KMnO4footprints were performed using supercoiled plasmids containing theproU and control promoters (e.g.β-lac promoter). To perform these KMnO4footprints, plasmid pBJ10 was constructed containing theproU promoter, and its DRE fused to the luciferase genes in the vector pAV1990 (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, luciferase assays were performed to determine whether the in vivo expression of the proU promoter in pBJ10 was repressed by H-NS and activated at high osmolarity. As expected, thein vivo expression of the proU promoter in pBJ10 was repressed by H-NS and induced 176-fold at high osmolarity (TableIII). Next, β-lactamase assays were performed to see whether the in vivo expression of the β-lac promoters in vector pAV1990 and plasmid pBJ10 were repressed by H-NS and activated at high osmolarity. As expected, the β-lac promoter in the vector pAV1990 was not induced at high osmolarity and not repressed by H-NS (Table IV). In contrast, however, the β-lac promoter of pBJ10 was induced 8.7-fold at high osmolarity and repressed 2.58-fold by H-NS (Table IV). Thus, the β-lac promoter is not osmoregulated or repressed by H-NS in the vector pAV1990. The osmoregulation and repression of the β-lac promoter in plasmid PBJ10 must be due to the presence of the proU promoter and/or the DRE on the same plasmid (e.g. because of readthrough from theproU promoter). The β-lac promoter of pAV1990 is therefore a good control to determine whether the in vitro repression by H-NS and derepression by K+-glutamate is specific for the proUpromoter.Table IIIThe proU but not the β-lac promoter is activated at high osmolarityStrainLow osmolarityHigh osmolarityInduction ratio (high osmolarity:low osmolarity)LT2 (wild type)9216,253176.7SA4105 (hns −)75816,04921.2Repression ratio (hns −:hns +)8.20.99Luciferase activity of pBJ10 (“Experimental Procedures”) containing the proU promoter and the DRE upstream of the luciferase reporter genes is shown.

All activities are given as millivolt light output/100 μl sample/A 600 nm. KMnO4 footprints were performed on both theproU and the β-lac promoters of supercoiled plasmid pBJ10 and on the β-lac promoter of supercoiled vector pAV1990. Increasing amounts of purified H-NS protein were added to the reaction mix and incubated before adding 2 units of RNA polymerase. KMnO4 footprints were performed as described for circular DNA fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”). These footprints indicated that 1 μg of H-NS was sufficient to inhibit the formation of an open complex by RNA polymerase on the proUpromoter of pBJ10 and on the β-lac promoters of pBJ10 and pAV1990. The finding that the proU and β-lacpromoter respond similarly is not in agreement with in vivodata showing that the proU promoter is repressed by H-NS (Table III), whereas the β-lac promoter on pAV1990 is not repressed and the β-lac promoter of pBJ10 is only slightly repressed by H-NS (Table IV). These data suggest that repression of transcription by H-NS seen in vitro is nonspecific. Next, different amounts of K+-glutamate were added to the reaction mixtures to a final concentration of 0, 100, 200, or 400 mm. At 200 and 400 mm K+-glutamate, increasing open complex formation was seen at the proU and β-lac promoters of pBJ10 (Fig.2 A) and at the β-lac promoter of pAV1990 (Fig. 2 B). Again these data are in contrast with the in vivo data (Tables IIIand IV), which show that the proU, but not the β-lac promoter, is osmoregulated. Thus, repression by H-NS and derepression by K+-glutamate of open complex formationin vitro is nonspecific and does not reflect the in vivo expression of the promoters studied. Two reasons may explain why the in vitro footprints do not reflect the in vivo situation. First, a factor (an unknown protein, a subtle change in the composition of the buffer, the level of molecular crowding, etc.) is missing in the in vitro system. Alternatively, the in vivo expression of proU is not regulated at the level of open complex formation; in this case a correlation between in vivo expression and in vitro open complex formation would not be expected. In vivo KMnO4 footprints were performed to determine whether or not the in vivo expression of the proUpromoter is regulated at the level of open complex formation. In vivo KMnO4footprints were performed to determine whether open complex formation at the proU promoter is induced by increased osmolarity. The data in Fig. 3 show that theproU promoter is clearly regulated at the level of open complex formation in vivo (compare lanes with theproU promoter at high and low osmolarity). Open complex formation at the control promoter (β-lac) in vivo did not increase at high osmolarity (Fig. 3, compare lanes with the β-lac promoter at high and low osmolarity). Thus, the activity of the proU promoter is regulated at the level of open complex formation in vivo. Plasmids pDO178 and pDO207 (26.Overdier D.G. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were used in in vivo KMnO4 footprints to study the effect of deleting the DRE on open complex formation at the proU promoter. These plasmids were used because the effect of including the DRE had the greatest effect on osmoregulation in these plasmids (26.Overdier D.G. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Plasmid pDO207 does not contain the DRE, and the proU promoter in this construct is therefore only 5-fold repressed at low osmolarity. In contrast, plasmid pDO178 contains the DRE and is 130-fold repressed at low osmolarity (26.Overdier D.G. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4show that the proU promoter in plasmid pDO207 forms an open complex at low osmolarity, whereas the proU promoter in plasmid pDO178 does not form an open complex at low osmolarity. Thus despite the distance from the proU promoter, the DRE acts to repress open complex formation at this promoter in vivo. In this paper we investigated the mechanism by which K+-glutamate, the DRE, and the chromatin-associated protein H-NS regulate the expression of the proU promoter ofS. typhimurium. It has been proposed that the increased levels of intracellular K+-glutamate at high osmolarity induce expression of the proU promoter at high osmolarity (5.Prince W.S. Villarejo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17673-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ramirez R.M. Prince W.S. Bremer E. Villarejo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7.Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8.Jovanovich S.B. Record Jr., M.T. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7821-7825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the osmotic induction of proU must be more complex. We demonstrate that the in vivo regulation is at the level of open complex formation and that the DRE, despite its distance from the proU promoter, acts in vivo to repress the formation of an open complex at the proUpromoter. Open complex formation at both the proU and the β-lac promoters is similarly inhibited by H-NS and activated by K+-glutamate in an in vitro assay. However, unlike the proU promoter, the β-lacpromoter is not inhibited by H-NS or induced at high osmolarityin vivo. Therefore, the effect of K+-glutamate on the proU promoter cannot be a specific osmoregulatory response, and simple binding of H-NS and induction by K+-glutamate are not sufficient to explain the specific osmoregulation of proU seen in vivo (27.Jordi B.J.A.M. Fielder A.E. Burns C.M. Hinton J.C.D. Dover N. Ussery D.W. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12083-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that K+-glutamate generally enhances the binding of RNA polymerase to promoters and facilitates the interaction of proteins with DNA has been described (9.Richey B. Cayley D.S. Mossing M.C. Kolka C. Anderson C.F. Farrar T.C. Record Jr., M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Roe J.-H. Record Jr., M.T.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These findings are in agreement with data showing that in vivo accumulation of glutamate is not required for the induction of proU at high osmolarity (11.Csonka L.N. Ikeda T.P. Fletcher S.A. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6324-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, because the accumulation of K+ is necessary for activation of proU (40.Sutherland L. Cairney J. Elmore M.J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 805-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the accumulation of K+-glutamate is necessary but not sufficient to explain the induction of proU at high osmolarity. The DRE is located between nucleotide +73 and +274 downstream from the transcription start site (25.Fletcher S.A. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4508-4513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the proU promoter. The DRE is required for full repression by H-NS at low osmolarity. However, no effect of the presence or absence of the DRE on open complex formation is seen in vitro, with or without H-NS added (data not shown). So again it is clear that the regulation of the expression ofproU is more complex. The fact that in vivo the expression of proU is regulated at the level of open complex formation further defines the step at which the osmoregulation is achieved. To date it has only been shown that the amount of proU mRNA is increased dramatically at high osmolarity (41.Jordi B.J.A.M. Owen-Hughes T.A. Hulton C.S.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5690-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); this could be explained by a change in transcription-intitiation, transcription-elongation, transcription-termination, or RNA decay. Quantifications of the footprints shown in Figs. 3 and 4 show that the proUexpression is regulated at the level of open complex formation. Our data seem to be in contrast with data described by Ueguchi and Mizuno (7.Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). They suggest that the expression of proU can be mimicked in vitro, as measured by single round transcription assays. The differences found between their results and our results might be explained by the fact that different methods are used. Here we use the formation of an open complex by RNA polymerase as a measurement for the expression of proU. We show here that the expression of proU in vivo is regulated at this level. Therefore, we think we are assaying the right step in the transcription ofproU. Recent data indicate that DNA sequences flanking bacterial promoters can repress their activity (26.Overdier D.G. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Lucht J.M. Dersch P. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Biol.

Juarez A. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 242-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these flanking DNA regions repress promoter activity has not been resolved yet. In case of the proU promoter of S. typhimurium, the exact distance between the promoter and the DRE is not important for the repression (25.Fletcher S.A. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4508-4513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Jordi B.J.A.M. Fielder A.E. Burns C.M. Hinton J.C.D. Dover N. Ussery D.W. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12083-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore the relative orientation of the DRE and the promoter on the “face of the helix” can be changed with little effect on the regulation of the expression (27.Jordi B.J.A.M. Fielder A.E. Burns C.M. Hinton J.C.D. Dover N. Ussery D.W. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12083-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems unlikely that specific interactions between proteins bound at the promoter and the DRE are involved in the regulation of the expression. In this paper we show that the DRE represses the activity of the proU promoter at an early step in the transcription. Either the binding of RNA polymerase or the separation of the two strands (open complex formation) by RNA polymerase is inhibited from a distance by this downstream DNA. We thank Christopher M. Burns, Stephen Gunn, Daniel Forbes-Ford, Jay Hinton, Paul McDermott, and Julie M. Sidebotham for helpful discussions and Jay Hinton and Clare Smyth for purification of the H-NS protein.

To examine the effect of the cAMP signal transduction pathway on transcription of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), G6Pase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion genes were transiently transfected into either the liver-derived HepG2 or kidney-derived LLC-PK cell line. Co-transfection of an expression vector encoding the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) markedly stimulated G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression, and mutational analysis of the G6Pase promoter revealed that multiple regions are required for this PKA response in both the HepG2 and LLC-PK cell lines. A sequence in the G6Pase promoter that resembles a cAMP response element is required for the full PKA response in both HepG2 and LLC-PK cells. However, in LLC-PK cells, but not in HepG2 cells, a hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) binding site was critical for the full induction of G6Pase-CAT expression by PKA. Changing this HNF-1 motif to that for the yeast transcription factor GAL4 reduces the PKA response in LLC-PK cells to the same degree as deleting the HNF-1 site. However, co-transfection of this mutated construct with chimeric proteins comprising the GAL4-DNA binding domain ligated to the coding sequence for HNF-1α, HNF-1β, HNF-3, or HNF-4 completely restored the PKA response.

The elevated hepatic glucose production is a consequence of an increased rate of gluconeogenesis, rather than glycogenolysis (15.Consoli A.

It has been suggested that abnormal expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes, such as G6Pase, may contribute to the increase in hepatic glucose production (16.Granner D.K. O'Brien R.M.

Zitoun C. Bruni N. Daniele N. Minassian C. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35.Minassian C. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that renal G6Pase expression and activity both increase during a prolonged fast, a condition associated with alterations in the concentration of multiple metabolites including elevated renal cAMP concentrations (36.Selawry H. Gutman R. Fink G. Recant L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 51: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, parathormone, acting via cAMP, stimulates renal glucose-6-phosphatase activity (37.Delaval E. Moreau E. Geloso J.P. Pediatr. Res. 1981; 15: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).Recently, Chou and colleagues (38.Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14096-14106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that a region of the human G6Pase promoter encompassing the sequence between −136 and −134 was required for the stimulatory effect of cAMP on G6Pase fusion gene expression in HepG2 cells. By contrast, Burchell and co-workers (39.Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) found that in H4IIE hepatoma cells the human G6Pase promoter sequence located between −161 and −152 was critical for the combined stimulatory effects of cAMP and glucocorticoids. This region was shown to contain a cAMP response element (CRE) based on the ability of this sequence to confer cAMP responsiveness on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene (39.Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The explanation for this discrepancy is unclear, but, in the present study, we examined the effect of the cAMP signal transduction pathway on the regulation of G6Pase gene transcription in both the liver-derived HepG2 and kidney-derived LLC-PK cell lines. We provide evidence that the regulation of G6Pase fusion gene transcription by cAMP is more complex than originally reported (38.Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14096-14106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39.Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Specifically, we find that multiple promoter elements are required for the stimulatory effect of cAMP on G6Pase fusion gene transcription in both HepG2 and LLC-PK cells. However, the qualitative importance of specific elements differs in the two cell types. Most notably, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) plays an essential role in the induction of G6Pase fusion gene transcription by cAMP in LLC-PK cells, but not in HepG2 cells.DISCUSSIONIn the postabsorptive state, the liver is generally believed to be responsible for approximately 95% of whole body glucose production, with the kidneys contributing the remaining 5% (64.Ekberg K. Landau B.R. Wajngot A. Chandramouli V. Efendic S. Brunengraber H. Wahren J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, some recent reports have suggested that the renal contribution may be as large as 20–25% (65.Cersosimo E. Garlick P. Ferretti J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 66.Cersosimo E. Garlick P. Ferretti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E78-E84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions that challenge normal glucose homeostasis, such as exercise, prolonged fasting, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and diabetes, require the kidney to play a more prominent role in the production of glucose (67.Stumvoll M. Meyer C. Mitrakou A. Nadkarni V. Gerich J.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Despite the increased importance of the kidney in times of glucose demand, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating renal gluconeogenesis. In the present paper, we have examined the regulation of G6Pase gene transcription by the cAMP pathway in both the kidney-derived LLC-PK and the liver-derived HepG2 cell lines. The data presented demonstrate that multiple cis-acting elements are required for the full stimulatory effect of cAMP on G6Pase-CAT gene expression (Figs. 3, 4, and 7). This type of multi-element promoter structure is termed a hormone response unit (68.Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), or in this instance a cAMP response unit (CRU). Our results differ from those of Chou and colleagues (38.Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14096-14106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Burchell and colleagues (39.Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), who both reported the involvement of single elements in the cAMP response. The reason for this difference is due to the use of the PKA co-transfection technique in our experiments, rather than the use of cAMP analogs (38.Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14096-14106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39.Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The larger induction of G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression obtained by using the PKA co-transfection technique is critical for the delineation of a multiple component CRU.Although a CRU is required for the full stimulatory effect of cAMP on G6Pase gene transcription in both the HepG2 and LLC-PK cell lines, it is apparent that the quantitative importance of the variouscis-acting elements that comprise this CRU varies in the two cell lines. In particular, deletion or mutation of the HNF-1 site in the G6Pase promoter reduces PKA-stimulated G6Pase-CAT gene expression by ∼95% in LLC-PK cells (Fig. 4), whereas this same deletion is less deleterious in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). These results on G6Pase gene expression are somewhat similar to those of Hanson and colleagues (69.Liu J.S. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who were the first to use the PKA co-transfection technique to define a CRU in a promoter, namely that of another gluconeogenic enzyme-encoding gene, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). They showed that fourcis-acting elements (designated the CRE, P3[I], P3[II], and P4) were required for PKA-stimulated PEPCK fusion gene transcription in the HepG2 cell line, results that were subsequently confirmed in transgenic animals (70.Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar). HNF-1 binds to the P2 site in the PEPCK promoter but is not required for PKA-induced PEPCK gene expression in HepG2 cells (70.Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar). However, as with G6Pase, HNF-1 does play a key role in the maximal induction of PEPCK gene expression by cAMP in the kidney (60.Liu X. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F347-F355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Previous studies by Nagamine and colleagues (71.Marksitzer R. Stief A. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 72.Soubt M.K. Marksitzer R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) on the urokinase-type plasminogen activator promoter suggest that HNF-1 acts as an accessory factor to enhance the stimulatory effect of the cAMP signal transduction pathway on renal gene expression rather than acting as a direct target of PKA itself. Thus, these investigators demonstrated that an HNF-1 site in the urokinase-type plasminogen activator promoter was required for the full cAMP response (71.Marksitzer R. Stief A. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 72.Soubt M.K. Marksitzer R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, they showed that HNF-1β was capable of interacting with CREB and ATF-1 in both a mammalian two-hybrid assay and a co-precipitation assay, providing a potential mechanism to explain the accessory factor action of HNF-1 (72.Soubt M.K. Marksitzer R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, Nagamine and co-workers (72.Soubt M.K. Marksitzer R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HNF-1β was not phosphorylated by PKA in vitro or in LLC-PK cells treated with cAMP, arguing against HNF-1 directly mediating a PKA response. It remains to be determined whether HNF-1α is phosphorylated by PKA, but there is no obvious consensus PKA phosphorylation site located within the HNF-1α protein. Moreover, since both HNF-3 and HNF-4 can substitute for HNF-1 and act as accessory factors to enhance the stimulatory effect of PKA (Fig. 6 B), this suggests that HNF-1 is playing a structural role in the G6Pase promoter, acting by altering DNA conformation or accessibility, rather than directly affecting some component of the cAMP signal transduction pathway. Finally, HNF-1 can also act as an accessory factor to enhance the action of both insulin (32.Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and glucocorticoids (73.Suh D.S. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) on gene transcription.GSD type 1 results from an inborn error of metabolism in which glucose-6-phosphatase activity is either absent or severely diminished. Patients present to the clinic with a variety of ailments including hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, lactic acidemia, hepatomegaly, kidney enlargement, and growth retardation (9.Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 1999; 10: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Chen Y.T. Pediatr.

Poor metabolic control can result in severe systemic complications including pulmonary hypertension and even renal failure (9.Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 1999; 10: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11.Chen Y.T. Pediatr.

Some GSD type 1 patients with poor metabolic control are afflicted with a renal Fanconi-like syndrome characterized by proximal renal tubular defects including β2-microglobinuria, generalized amino aciduria, phosphaturia, and renal tubular acidosis (11.Chen Y.T. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1991; 5: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pontoglio and co-workers (74.Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) reported that HNF-1α-deficient mice are also characterized by a renal Fanconi-like syndrome. This observation, in combination with our results demonstrating the requirement of HNF-1 to induce G6Pase gene expression in response to the cAMP pathway, make it enticing to speculate that dysregulation of G6Pase gene expression in HNF-1α-deficient animals may contribute to the renal Fanconi-like syndrome associated with these animals. One caveat here is that the proximal tubule of the kidney, the site of G6Pase gene expression, expresses both HNF-1α and HNF-1β, whereas the LLC-PK cell line used in our studies only expresses HNF-1β (Fig. 5), even though this cell line is derived from the proximal tubule (58.Sepulveda F.V. Pearson J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is apparent that both HNF-1α and HNF-1β can enhance the action of the cAMP signal transduction pathway on G6Pase-CAT gene expression in the LLC-PK cell line (Fig. 6).Two regions of the human G6Pase promoter, which we have designated CRE1 and CRE2 for clarity (Table I), have previously been shown to be important for the stimulatory effect of cAMP on G6Pase fusion gene transcription (38.Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14096-14106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39.Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both CRE1 and CRE2 are involved in the induction of G6Pase gene transcription by the cAMP pathway in LLC-PK cells (Fig. 7 A). However, in LLC-PK cells only CRE1, and not CRE2, represents a bona fide CRE since only the former is able to confer a direct stimulatory effect of PKA on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene (Fig. 7 B). These data suggest that in LLC-PK cells the cAMP pathway directly targets the CRE1 region, while the CRE2 region acts as an accessory factor binding site to enhance the cAMP effect mediated through CRE1. The sequence of the CRE2 region (−136TTGCATCA−129; see TableI), only has weak homology to a consensus CRE (TGACGTCA), but Chou and colleagues (38.Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y.

https://openalex.org/W1975294521,"In <i>Trypanosomatids</i>, endocytosis and exocytosis occur exclusively at the flagellar pocket, a deep invagination of the plasma membrane where the flagellum extends from the cell. Both bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes are capable of internalizing macromolecules. However, structures resembling coated vesicles were only identified in bloodstream form and not in procyclic form trypanosomes. Due to the apparent absence of coated vesicles in procyclics, the significance of receptor-mediated endocytosis in procyclic trypanosomes has been considered of minimal importance. We show that the flagellar pocket associated cysteine-rich acidic transmembrane protein (CRAM) may function as an high density lipoprotein receptor in the procyclic form trypanosome. Using anti-CRAM IgG we have characterized the process of CRAM-mediated endocytosis in procyclic form trypanosomes. The wild type procyclic trypanosome binds and internalizes anti-CRAM IgG but not the non-immune IgG in a saturable and time-dependent manner; the binding and uptake of<sup>125</sup>I-labeled anti-CRAM IgG are inhibited by excess unlabeled anti-CRAM IgG. Uptake and degradation of anti-CRAM IgG do not occur at 4 °C. At 28 °C, the internalized anti-CRAM IgG were efficiently degraded through a process that is inhibited by incubation at 4 °C and sensitive to the presence of chloroquine. The uptake and degradation of anti-CRAM IgG does not occur in the CRAM null mutant cell line. These results suggested that the uptake of anti-CRAM IgG in the wild type procyclics occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis of the CRAM protein. Deletion of the cytoplasmic extension of CRAM drastically reduced the degradation but not the binding of anti-CRAM IgG. This result indicated that potential internalization signals may be present in the cytoplasmic extension of CRAM. This is the first time that the importance of receptor-mediated endocytosis in procyclic form trypanosomes has been demonstrated."

Association of cobalamins with haptocorrin always proceeded in one step. TC, however, displayed a certain selectivity for the ligands: Cbl·CN or Cbl·N3 bound in one step withk +1 = 1 × 108m−1 s−1 (20 °C), whereas binding of Cbl·OH2 under the same conditions occurred in two steps with k +1 = 3 × 10 7m−1 s−1(E a = 30 kJ/mol) andk +2 = 0.02 s−1(E a = 120 kJ/mol). The second step of Cbl·OH2 binding was interpreted as a transformation of the initial “open” intermediate TC·Cbl·OH2 to the “closed” conformation TC(Cbl) with displaced water. The backward transition from the closed to the open conformation was the reason for the identical rate-limiting steps during substitution of H2O in TC·Cbl·OH2 for cyanide or azide according to the reaction TC(Cbl) → TC·Cbl·OH2 + CN−/N3−.

Assimilation of the dietary B12 is a complex process with three successive Cbl transporters haptocorrin (HC), intrinsic factor (IF), and transcobalamin (TC) as well as several specific receptors involved (1.Rothenberg S.P.

Drugs Aging. 1998; 12: 277-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Efficient uptake of the very minute amounts of Cbl by an organism attracted attention to the Cbl-binding proteins, and some of their properties are well established. All binders retain Cbl extremely strongly with the dissociation constants of the protein-Cbl complexes lower than 1 pm (2.Nexø E. Kräutler B. Arigoni D. Golding T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins.

Structural deformations during Cbl binding were observed not only for specific proteins but also for Cbl itself, as concluded from studies on both Cbl-dependent enzymes (10.Kräutler B. Kräutler B. Arigoni D. Golding T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. John Wiley and Sons, Weinheim, Germany1998: 3-43Google Scholar) and Cbl transporters (2.Nexø E. Kräutler B. Arigoni D. Golding T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. John Wiley and Sons, Weinheim, Germany1998: 461-475Google Scholar). Distortion of enzyme-bound Cbl influences the properties of its catalytically essential upper axial group (called the β-group), which changes mobility by many orders of magnitude during the catalysis (10.Kräutler B.

However, the structural characteristics of cobalamins, associated with the transporting proteins, remain relatively unexplored. Changes in the absorbance spectrum of Cbl upon its binding to TC, IF, and HC (11.Allen R.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7702-7717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Nexø E.

Thorough kinetic investigation of the reactions between a transporting protein and cobalamins with different β-groups may help to elucidate the mechanism of formation and the internal organization of the protein-Cbl complex. In the present work we demonstrate that the interactions between TC and Cbl are influenced by the nature of the upper axial group of the vitamin. Human TC was expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris and purified. Cbl binding to TC was studied by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Our experiments showed that the direct attachment of aquo-Cbl (Cbl·OH2) to TC was followed by a slow structural rearrangement of the TC·Cbl·OH2 complex, in contrast to a simple one-step binding of two other cobalamins (Cbl·CN and Cbl·N3). Exchange of the β-group in cobalamins bound to TC pointed to a peculiar conformation of TC·Cbl·OH2when compared with TC·Cbl·CN/N3. Different conformations of holo-TC may potentially provide for specific targeting of different cobalamins in an organism. All salts and media components were purchased from Merck, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sigma, and Difco and were of analytical grade. The enzymes and kits for DNA handling were obtained from New England Biolabs, Stratagene, and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The kit for polymerase chain reaction was from HT Biotechnology Ltd. Human kidney Quick-Clone cDNA was purchased from Clonotech. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by DNA technology. The yeast expression system was purchased from Invitrogen. Fast Flow CM-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A TC-encoding fragment of DNA was amplified from a Quick-Clone cDNA preparation (human kidney) by polymerase chain reaction using TC-specific primers with adaptors for SalI and SpeI endonuclease sites. The major 1.2-kilobase pair DNA band on agarose electrophoresis was purified by electroelution and ligated to XhoI andSpeI sites of the expression plasmid pPIC-Z. The designed sequence of the fusion protein contained the secretion α-signal, the site for yeast protease Kex2, and the mature human TC. This construction ensured cleavage of the NH2-terminal peptides from the recombinant protein during its secretion: LDKR↓EMCEI (TC residues are underlined). The approach was analogous to the one described for bovine TC (15.Fedosov S.N. Berglund L. Nexø E. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In short, recombinant yeast cells SMD 1168 were grown to high density in glycerol-containing medium (4 liters). They were subsequently incubated in the same volume of the induction medium with methanol and Cbl·OH2. Proteins in the cell-free supernatant were precipitated by ammonium sulfate and subjected to ion exchange chromatography. Batch adsorption on CM-Sepharose (12 ml) was performed in 5 mm Pi buffer (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4), pH 6, and the matrix was washed sequentially with 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1m Pi buffer, pH 6. Red-colored holo-TC was eluted from CM-Sepharose with 0.2 m Pi buffer, pH 7.5. The obtained preparation was treated with 2,500 units of peptide N-glycosydase F at 37 °C for 2 days to remove carbohydrates from the protein. Then, TC was subjected to gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 (250 ml) equilibrated with 0.1m Tris, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. The fractions with red-colored protein were pooled and repurified on a 2-ml CM-Sepharose column. The correct NH2-terminal sequence of human TC was confirmed on a protein sequencer 477A (Perkin-Elmer). The final preparation contained 10–15 mg of the recombinant TC saturated with Cbl·OH2. It was either stored at −20 °C or dialyzed against H2O and lyophilized. The isolated holo-TC was depleted of endogenous Cbl by dialysis against 5 m Gnd for 30–40 h at 30 °C. The denaturing agent was removed during extensive dialysis against 0.2 m Pi buffer, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 5 °C. The preparation was centrifuged briefly to remove a small amount of insoluble protein, and the supernatant with apo-TC was either stored at −20 °C or dialyzed against H2O and lyophilized. Purification procedure for human holo-HC has been described elsewhere (16.Nexø E. Olesen H. Nørredam K. Schwartz N. Scand. J. Haematol. 1975; 14: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Apo-HC was prepared by dialysis of holo-HC against 8 m Gnd as described in the above paragraph. We have employed a new spectrophotometric method suitable for the determination of apo-TC at concentrations 0.1–1 mg/ml (2–20 μm). Apo-TC in 0.2m Pi buffer, pH 7.5, was titrated with Cbl·OH2 (1–4 μm) at 37 °C. Absorbances at 352 nm and 363 nm were measured after every addition, and the ratio of A 363 to A 352 was plotted versus the concentration of the added Cbl·OH2. The ratio of A 363 toA 352 remained approximately constant at Cbl·OH2 < TC, but it decreased steeply when the concentration of Cbl·OH2 exceeded the binding capacity of TC. The point of intercept between the two linear parts of the chart indicated the equivalence of the apo-TC and Cbl·OH2concentrations. Spectrophotometric determination of the binding capacity was confirmed by measurements of the binding capacity employing radioactive Cbl*·CN according to Gottliebet al. (17.Gottlieb C. Lau K.-S. Wasserman L.R. Herbert W. Blood. 1965; 25: 875-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of unsaturated HC was measured by the method of Gottlieb et al. (17.Gottlieb C. Lau K.-S. Wasserman L.R. Herbert W. Blood. 1965; 25: 875-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyano and azido forms of holo-TC were prepared by incubation of TC·Cbl·OH2 with 10 mm KCN or 50 mm NaN3 for 5 h at 37 °C. The spectra of TC·Cbl·OH2/CN/N3 (20–25 μm) were recorded. The amount of TC-associated Cbl was evaluated according to the concentration of the liberated Cbl as described earlier (12.Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The kinetics of apo-TC and apo-HC interaction with cobalamins was investigated on a DX.17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer from Applied Photophysics. The reaction was carried out in 0.2 m Pi buffer, pH 7.5, at either 20 °C or 37 °C. A 250-μl portion of the apoprotein (20–30 μm) in one of the drive syringes was mixed instantly with an equal volume of 10–100 μm Cbl from another drive syringe. The process of binding to apo-TC was monitored by the change in the absorbance of the γ1-peak at 363 nm for Cbl·OH2/N3 and 365 nm for Cbl·CN. The analogous reaction with apo-HC was followed at 355 nm for Cbl·OH2 (γ1-peak), 363 nm for Cbl·CN (γ1-peak), and 342 nm for Cbl·N3 (γ2-peak). In all cases the light pass was 1 cm, and the band pass was 18.6 nm. The dead time of the stopped-flow mixing was determined to be 1.6 ± 0.2 ms, and the measurements were assumed to be reliable after 2 ms of the record. Every transient was a mean of two or three consecutive measurements. Four independent preparations of TC and one preparation of HC were used in the experiments. The reaction was performed in 0.2 mPi buffer, pH 7.5, at either 20 °C or 37 °C. The concentration of the examined object (either Cbl·OH2 or TC·Cbl·OH2) was kept constant (20–30 μm) while the concentrations of added azide and cyanide varied in a broad range. The specific absorbance changes were followed either on an M350 double beam UV-visible spectrophotometer (Camspec) or on the stopped-flow equipment. Fitting of the curves was performed by a program for nonlinear regression analysis 2S. N. Fedosov, unpublished data. using the appropriate equations for the monomolecular and bimolecular reactions. Complex kinetics was simulated by the computer program Gepasi (18.Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The rate coefficients used in the simulations were obtained by trial and error, moving from an initial approximate estimate to the more appropriate set of parameters. Activation energies of the reactions were calculated from the rate constants at 20 °C and 37 °C according to the equation E a = R· ln(k 37/k 20)/(1/310 K − 1/293 K), where R = 8.315 J mol−1deg−1. Results of statistical analysis are presented as mean ± S.D. The genetic material for the expression of human TC was produced from commercially available human kidney cDNA. The corresponding cDNA fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using TC-specific primers, and the TC cDNA obtained was ligated to the expression plasmid. The sequence corroborated accuracy of the construction and was consistent with the known alleles of human TC (19.Platica O. Janeczko R. Quadros E.V. Regec A. Romain R. Rothen-berg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7860-7863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20.Li N. Seetharam S. Lindemans J. Alpers D.H. Arwert F. Seetharam B. Biochim. Biophys.

Rothen-berg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7860-7863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for Ser376 (TCG codon) replaced in our preparation by Leu376 (TTG codon). The Leu residue at position 376 was also observed in other TC alleles (20.Li N. Seetharam S. Lindemans J. Alpers D.H. Arwert F. Seetharam B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Isolation of the recombinant human TC was in many aspects similar to the method described for the recombinant bovine TC in our recent publication (15.Fedosov S.N. Berglund L. Nexø E. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SDS-electrophoresis of the final preparation contained a major band of 46 kDa and a number of minor bands (46–48 kDa) all having the NH2-terminal sequence of human TC (not shown). The bands with a molecular mass of above 46 kDa presumably represented human TC containing a small amount of carbohydrates remaining after deglycosylation (see “Methods”). The characteristics of Cbl binding and receptor recognition observed for the recombinant TC were similar to those for the natural TCs (11.Allen R.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7702-7717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13.Quadros E.V. Rothenberg S.P. Pan Y.C. Stein S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein-ligand complex (TC·Cbl·OH2) was very stable, and the procedure of apo-TC preparation required prolonged incubation in Gnd. When apo-TC after Gnd treatment was resaturated with [57Co]cyanocobalamin (Cbl*·CN) and exposed to a high excess of the nonradioactive Cbl·CN, no considerable release of Cbl*·CN was observed during 240 h of incubation at 20 °C. Liberation of Cbl*·CN from holo-TC at a higher temperature (37 °C) was exponential with the rate constant k − = 0.006 h−1 (not shown). For comparison, the recombinant bovine TC showed analogous behavior in our previous work (15.Fedosov S.N. Berglund L. Nexø E. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas holo-TC from bovine milk was characterized by k − = 0.007 h−1 in the analogous experiment at 20 °C (7.Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Nexø E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16082-16087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The recombinant human holo-TC was capable of binding to the specific receptor in the membranes of human placenta in a way indistinguishable from the natural human TC (not shown). Unfolded human TC did not contain free SH groups (<0.05 SH/TC molecule) as demonstrated by treatment of the protein with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobensoic acid) in 5m Gnd. This fact confirmed the presence of four S-S bridges in human TC proposed in our previous publication (15.Fedosov S.N. Berglund L. Nexø E. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cbl·OH2 (either free or bound to TC) with an excess of cyanide or azide converted the vitamin to its cyano or azido form, respectively, with the characteristic spectral changes (Fig.1). The recorded absorbance spectra of human holo-TC in complex with different cobalamins (Fig. 1 B) were comparable to those of holo-IF/-HC/-TC from different sources (11.Allen R.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7702-7717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys.

Comparison with the spectra of the free ligands (Fig.1 A) revealed the expected shift and intensification of the γ-peak in all protein-ligand complexes. It was particularly clear in the case of Cbl·OH2 where the original γ-peak was 11 nm red-shifted, and its intensity increased by a factor of 1.3 upon binding to TC. Binding of Cbl·CN and Cbl·N3 to TC proceeded quickly and monophasically in accordance with an irreversible bimolecular mechanism (Fig.2 A). The high values obtained for the association rate constants at 20 °C (TableI) precluded reliable measurements at 37 °C.Table IRate coefficients measured for the Cbl binding to apo-TC or apo-HC and for the displacement of cobalt-coordinated H2O in Cbl·OH2 or TC·Cbl·OH2ReactionTemperatureNo. of experimentsBimolecular reactionMonomolecular reaction°Cnk, m −1 s −1k, s −1Phase 1Phase 2TC + Cbl·CN203100 × 106TC + Cbl·N3203130 × 1060.02 ± 0.001TC + Cbl·OH2209(30 ± 6) × 1060.3 ± 0.08TC + Cbl·OH23714(60 ± 10) × 106Phase 1Phase 2HC + Cbl·CN20390 × 106HC + Cbl·N3203120 × 106HC + Cbl·OH220360 × 106ForwardReverseCbl·OH2 + CN−201040 ± 4Cbl·OH2 + CN−3715230 ± 20Cbl·OH2 + N3−205680 ± 6NDaND, not determined.Cbl·OH2 + N3−3792,500 ± 1500.125 ± 0.025ForwardCN−/N3− → ∞TC·Cbl·OH2 + CN−37350 × 10−5TC·Cbl·OH2 + CN−37350 × 10−5TC·Cbl·OH2 + N3−2038 × 10−5TC·Cbl·OH2 + N3−37355 × 10−5a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The absorbance change induced by the binding of Cbl·OH2to TC was biphasic both at 20 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 2, Aand B). The first phase was accomplished mainly in 20 ms and revealed a dependence on the Cbl concentration (Fig. 2 B). The process corresponded to an irreversible bimolecular reaction with the rate constant shown in Table I and the activation energyE a = 30 ± 8 kJ/mol. The second phase was much slower and continued for 200 s at 20 °C and 20 s at 37 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). The time course of that reaction was independent of Cbl concentration and could be fitted adequately to a monomolecular process (either reversible or irreversible) with the rate coefficient presented in Table I. The activation energy for the second phase E a = 120 ± 10 kJ/mol exceeded the one for the first phase considerably. Binding of cobalamins to TC can be represented by Scheme 1a for Cbl·CN and Cbl·N3 or Scheme 1b for Cbl·OH2 (Fig. 3) where one can expect that k +1 ≫k -1 and k +2 >k -2 (i.e. k 1≈ k +1 and k 2 ≈k +2). The observed reactions corresponded to an irreversible bimolecular process (see Fig.2 C and Table I). None of the cobalamins revealed a slow phase during the binding to HC. Displacement of H2O in Cbl·OH2(20–30 μm) by either cyanide or azide was followed by a change in the specific absorbance of Cbl. The reaction with cyanide proceeded according to a simple bimolecular mechanism Cbl·OH2 + CN− → Cbl·CN and was irreversible under the conditions of the experiment (Fig.4 A). The rate constant of this reaction (k +CN) was measured at two temperatures, and the obtained values are presented in Table I. They correspond to the activation energy E a = 80 ± 5 kJ/mol. The binding of azide (Fig. 4 B) was a reversible process Cbl·OH2 + N-3 ⇔ Cbl·N3 described by the parameters shown in Table I. The activation energy of the binding step (k +N3) wasE a = 60 ± 4 kJ/mol. The calculated rate constants were consistent with the known values ofK d for the dissociation of cyanide or azide from their complexes with Cbl: K d < 1 pm andK d = 40 μm, respectively (22.Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Williams R.J.P. Jackson W.R. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Substitution of water in the β-position of Cbl was a monophasic reaction in both cases, i.e. the acid-base mixture Cbl·OH2/OH observed at pH 7.5 (12.Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) behaved as a homogeneous pool of molecules but not as the independently reacting species Cbl·OH2 and Cbl·OH. When Cbl·OH2 was converted to Cbl·N3 by 1–2,000 mm N3−, the following reaction with cyanide (172 μm) was essentially decelerated (Fig. 4 C, inset). The rate coefficient of CN− binding on the background of saturating azide decreased by a factor of 400 and stabilized on a constant level (Fig. 4 C). This observation implied that cyanide was able to displace cobalt-coordinated azide in two ways: 1) by competition for the remaining Cbl·OH2 and reversion of N3− binding and 2) by direct interaction with Cbl·N3. The system is described by Scheme 2 (Fig. 3) and fitted to a second order reaction with the observed rate coefficient k obs. The calculated kinetic parameters were: k +CN = 225m−1 s−1,K N3 = 47 μm,k ∞= 0.57 m−1s−1, 37 °C (Fig. 4 C). Similar experiments on the group exchange were carried out with cobalamins bound to TC. Reaction of TC·Cbl·OH2 with CN− resembled the H2O substitution in the protein-free Cbl·OH2 but only at a low concentration of cyanide (Fig. 5 A). Thus, the initial velocity of the reaction increased proportionally to the concentration of the added compound at CN− < 1 mm. At higher concentrations of the reagent the initial velocity showed a clear tendency to stabilize at a constant level independently of the CN− concentration. Extrapolation to an infinite CN− concentration resulted in a rate coefficient shown in Table I where the activation energy of the process was equal to E a = 70–80 kJ/mol. The TC·Cbl·OH2 interaction with azide (Fig.5 B) also deviated from the reversible bimolecular mechanism observed for the binding of azide to free Cbl·OH2. Although the N3− concentration increased from 0.15 to 50 mm, the rate coefficient of the process decreased 10 times and stabilized at a constant level withE a = 85 kJ/mol. The parameters of the reaction with holo-TC at saturating azide were almost identical to those at saturating cyanide (Table I). In the next assay TC·Cbl·OH2 was preequilibrated with 0–100 mm azide and exposed to a constant level of cyanide (Fig. 5 C). The reaction revealed two distinct phases at subsaturating azide, where the amplitude of the rapid phase was more prominent at higher N3− (Fig.5 C). Velocity of the first phase declined with increasing N3− and stabilized at a constant level. Velocity of the second phase of cyanide binding was independent of N3− and corresponded to the reaction TC·Cbl·OH2 + CN−. The general behavior of the system during exchange of the β-group in holo-TC (Fig. 5, A–C) was simulated according to Scheme 3 (Fig. 3) where k +2 = 0.3 s−1,k −2 = 5 × 10−4s−1, k +N3 = 2,500m−1 s−1,k −N3 = 7.5 × 10−3s−1, k +CN = 250m−1 s−1,k ∞= 7 × 10−3m−1 s−1 at 37 °C. The results of simulation are depicted in Fig. 5, A–C, as solid lines. Irreversible precipitation of both TC·Cbl·CN and TC·Cbl·N3 was induced by the temperature jump from −20 °C to 37 °C as well as by prolonged (20–30 h) storage at 20–37 °C. No effect of that kind was observed for TC·Cbl·OH2 at concentrations as high as 7 mg/ml. Treatment of holo-TC with 10 mm dithiothreitol also revealed different solubilities of the complexes: the aquo complex precipitated after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C whereas the cyano and azido complexes remained soluble. Prolonged dialysis against SH-containing buffer resulted in liberation of the endogenous Cbl, as it was established earlier for the recombinant bovine TC (15.Fedosov S.N. Berglund L. Nexø E. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The experimental data on cobalamins binding to the specific transporters are rather scattered and not always comparable. In addition, most of the available information was obtained in experiments under equilibrium conditions, thus precluding identification of the individual steps of the binding process. Expression of the recombinant human TC in a sufficient amount provided the opportunity to perform the stopped-flow spectroscopic measurements and analyze details of the binding process. Those experiments demonstrated that the binding of the vitamin to TC was rapid and followed a one-step mechanism for Cbl·CN and Cbl·N3 (analogous to the interaction of Cbl·CN with bovine TC (7.Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Nexø E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16082-16087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)), while the same process for Cbl·OH2comprised both rapid and slow phases (Fig. 2). Fast reactions observed for all cobalamins were dependent on the Cbl concentration,i.e. they apparently reflected direct attachment of the ligand to the protein. The binding rate constants of the ligands increased in the following order: Cbl·OH2 (1 ×k +1), Cbl·CN (3 ×k +1), Cbl·N3 (4 ×k +1) (Table I). The similar array of values was obtained in experiments with another Cbl-specific protein, human HC, although the dispersion of k +1 for Cbl·OH2/CN/N3 binding was less pronounced (Table I). The observed difference in the binding rate constants probably has a structural basis: NMR analysis (23.Konrat R. Tollinger M. Kräutler B Kräutler B. Arigoni D. Golding T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. John Wiley and Sons, Weinheim, Germany1998: 349-368Google Scholar) as well as crystallographic studies (24.Gruber K. Jogl G. Klintschar G. Kratky C. Kräutler B. Arigoni D. Golding T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. John Wiley and Sons, Weinheim, Germany1998: 335-347Google Scholar) revealed variations in the three-dimensional structure of Cbl, depending on the compound coordinated at the β-position. Although the concentration-dependent rapid phase was observed for all three ligands, the slow phase of the absorbance change was associated specifically with the Cbl·OH2 binding to TC (Fig. 2, A and B). The biphasic nature of this reaction does not seem to be caused by the acid-base heterogeneity of Cbl·OH2/OH at pH 7.5 (12.Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for the following reasons. First, the half-reaction time of the second phase was independent of the concentration of Cbl·OH2. Second, the activation energy of the reaction was very high (E a = 120 kJ/mol). In fact, the calculated E a value was of the same order of magnitude as the activation energy observed for some essential rearrangements in the protein structure (25.Esmann M. Fedosova N.U. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, the slow phase of absorbance change can be attributed to a significant transformation in the ternary structure of TC·Cbl·OH2complex affecting properties of Cbl·OH2 in the binding site. The slow phase was not observed when cobalamins reacted with another specific protein (HC) under identical conditions (Fig. 2, C). This points to lower sensitivity of HC to the ligand structure, which was also observed during binding of Cbl analogs (1.Rothenberg S.P. Quadros E.V. Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1995; 8: 499-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2.Nexø E. Kräutler B. Arigoni D. Golding T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins.

The ability of TC to distinguish among cobalamins with different upper axial groups (in our case -OH2, -CN, and -N3) is apparently associated with the internal properties of these cobalt-coordinated compounds. It is known that Cbl (both free and in complex with a specific protein) can exchange its β-group in favor of an external compound capable of complex formation with corrins and present in the sufficient concentration (12.Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15.Fedosov S.N. Berglund L. Nexø E. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Williams R.J.P. Jackson W.R. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26.Nexø E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These compounds can be classified according to their affinity to the Cbl ring as strong, intermediate, and weak substituents, where CN−, N3− and H2O are typical representatives from the above classes (22.Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Williams R.J.P. Jackson W.R. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues (histidine, lysine) are also potential candidates for the coordination at β-position of Cbl as imidazole and amino groups exhibit intermediate affinity to this site (12.Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22.Firth R.A. Hill H.A.O. Pratt J.M. Williams R.J.P. Jackson W.R. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26.Nexø E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The above classification may serve as a clue to the nature of the conformational transition inferred from the kinetic experiments. Upon binding of Cbl·OH2 to TC, the weakly associated water of Cbl·OH2 can be displaced by an amino acid residue of the protein, which is reflected by the second slow phase of the absorbance change. At the same time, the relatively strong substituents (CN− and N3−) persist this displacement because of their high affinity to Cbl. The conformational rearrangement of the protein during the binding of Cbl·CN and Cbl·N3 is therefore hampered, and the slow phase of the reaction is not observed. The designed kinetic model of interaction between TC and Cbl, presented in Fig. 6, postulates the existence of at least two distinct conformations of holo-TC: “open” and “closed.” The complexes of TC with Cbl·CN and Cbl·N3 exist exclusively in the open conformation, whereas the prevailing form of the aquo complex is the closed one, where the upper surface of the bound Cbl is inaccessible for the external agents. We suggest here a substitution of the upper axial water in Cbl·OH2 for an amino acid residue, but a simple shielding of the upper surface of Cbl·OH2 by the protein is also a feasible explanation. If one exposes the aquo form of holo-TC to a high concentration of an external cobalt complexion, the added ligand would react rapidly only with the open conformation of TC·Cbl·OH2. This would make the slow transition between the protein conformations rate-limiting for the whole process: TC(Cbl) → TC·Cbl· OH2 + CN−/N3− … Under these circumstances, one can expect the apparent mechanism of binding to be consistent with the monomolecular reaction (but not the bimolecular one) and characterized by the same parameters for any ligand. This effect was confirmed experimentally when the aquo form of holo-TC was exposed to either CN− or N3− (known to bind to free Cbl·OH2 with different velocities). At high concentrations of the reagents both reactions became monomolecular (Fig. 5, A and B) and were described by the comparable rate coefficients (Table I) and the similar activation energies E a = 80 kJ/mol. This is a strong argument for the identity of the critical steps in both processes corresponding in our model to the backwards transition between the closed and open conformations. Other evidence supporting the suggested model comes from the biphasic kinetics seen for the interactions of cyanide with the heterogeneous pool comprising both azido and aquo forms of holo-TC (Fig.5 C). The rapid phase reflects the reaction of cyanide with the available and fast equilibrating open pool TC·Cbl·N3 ⇔ TC·Cbl·OH2, whose absolute size increases at high concentrations of N3−. Cyanide preferentially interacts with the TC·Cbl·OH2 component of the open pool as follows from the declining velocity of the rapid phase at increasing N3− concentrations. The second phase of the process, seen at subsaturating N3−concentrations, was associated with the slow transition from the remaining closed form to the open conformation TC(Cbl) ⇔ TC·Cbl·OH2 followed by immediate equilibration of TC·Cbl·OH2 with N3− and CN−. Validity of the proposed model has been supported by the fact that the computer simulation of its kinetic behavior resulted in the appropriate fit of the experimental data (Fig. 5). Stabilities of the open and closed conformations of holo-TC in solution seem to be different: whereas the aquo complex (the only species with the closed conformation) was soluble at a high protein concentration in a wide range of temperature, the cyano and azido complexes precipitated irreversibly during storage or because of temperature jumps. Treatment of holo-TC with dithiothreitol also caused different consequences: the aqua form precipitated within 1 h, whereas cyano- and azido-TC remained soluble during that time. The presented interpretation of the data also has a physiological aspect. If different tissues exhibit some preferences toward certain forms of cobalamin, the ability of holo-TC to exist in different conformations (depending on the bound ligand) may be important for the trafficking of the vitamin and the receptor recognition. In fact, it was shown that the uptake of 5′-deoxyadenosyl-Cbl by reticulocytes was four times more efficient than that of Cbl·CN (27.Herbert V. Sullivan L.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 112: 855-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The relatively high content of Cbl·OH2 in the body (20–30% of all cobalamins (28.Gimsing P. Nexø E. Hall C.A. The Cobalamins. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1983: 7-30Google Scholar)) may imply biological significance of the closed TC conformation during transportation of Cbl. We acknowledge gratefully A. L.

Several types of preβ-HDL are excellent substrates for plasma LCAT and are rapidly converted to spherical HDL particles or α-HDL (16.Czarnecka H. Yokoyama S.

If these particles are not converted to α-HDL, it has been shown that the lipid-poor apoA-I are rapidly cleared from circulation by the kidney (18.Goldberg I.J. Blaner W.S. Vanni T.M. Moukides M.

The antiatherogenic role of plasma HDL apoA-I in cholesterol removal has been recently questioned because of reports describing mutations within the apoA-I coding sequence, which lead to low concentrations of HDL apoA-I and for which little or no association to coronary heart disease has been demonstrated in affected individuals. Clinical studies of low apoA-I concentrations have been restricted by the limited number of subject identified with this disorder and the high incidence of confounding differences in lipoprotein metabolism among subjects (20.Ng D.S.

Lipidol. 1998; 8: 189-196Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Animal models of apoA-I deficiency have shown that the apoA-I knockout mice are not predisposed to diet-induced atherogenesis (22.Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,23.Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The lack of plasma apoA-I does not by itself lead to the development of atherosclerosis but instead, its absence leads to an increase in atherosclerosis susceptibility especially when accompanied by other risk factors, such as elevated low density lipoprotein concentrations (4.Hughes S.D. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Humans unlike mice have greater concentrations of “pro-atherogenic lipoproteins” such as very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein in their plasma. Therefore, it appears that HDL apoA-I serves a protective role by minimizing the effects of pro-atherogenic factors (4.Hughes S.D. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) consistent with the hypotheses deduced from a large number of human epidemiological studies (1.Gordon T. Castelli W.P.

The remaining apoA-I mutations that appear to lower HDL apoA-I levels are located within repeats adjacent to repeat six, namely repeats four, five, and seven. Of the human mutations associated with low HDL concentrations, five show dominant negative effects on plasma HDL apoA-I concentrations (34.Miettinen H.E. Gylling H. Miettinen T.A. Viikari J.

In particular, one of the naturally occurring human mutations, apoA-I Seattle (36.Deeb S.S. Cheung M.C. Peng R.L. Wolf A.C. Stern R. Albers J.J. Knopp R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13654-13660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is caused by an in-frame deletion of 15 amino acids that leads to re-orientation of repeat six's hydrophobic face. Our laboratory has studied a similar mutation, apoA-I Δ6, and has hypothesized that the placement and depth of penetration of repeat six's hydrophobic face into the phospholipid bilayer is one critical determinant of LCAT activation and catalysis (40.Sorci-Thomas M.G.

In this manuscript we report the metabolic consequences of expressing Δ6 apoA-I in transgenic mice in the presence and absence of endogenous mouse apoA-I. Results from this study show that deletion of apoA-I repeat 6 sharply increases HDL catabolism, dramatically lowers plasma cholesterol esterification, and blocks the maturation of lipid-poor HDL to cholesterol ester-rich HDL even in the presence of wild-type mouse apoA-I. The apoA-I Δ6 mutation was prepared by polymerase chain reaction megaprimer mutagenesis using a 2.2-kilobase PstI DNA fragment of the human apoA-I gene as previously reported (40.Sorci-Thomas M.G.

Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production of human Δ6 apoA-I transgenic mice was carried out by DNA microinjection into C57BL/6J × SJL/J F2 zygotes using standard techniques (44.Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, NY1994Google Scholar,45.Polites H.G. Pinkert C.A. Pinkert C.A. Transgenic Animal Technology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 15-68Crossref Google Scholar). Following weaning of founder mice, a mouse tail biopsy of approximately 1 cm in length was used for DNA analysis. Tail DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the mutant apoA-I transgene. All transgenic founders were further genotyped by Southern blot (46.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 187-209Google Scholar), Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (47.Koritnik D.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities in Microisolater TM caging (Lab Products, Maywood, NJ). All experiments and animal procedures conformed to protocols approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Wake Forest University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Founder animals carrying the transgene were bred to either C57BL/6J or apoA-I knockout (apoA-I −/−) mice (22.Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and the appropriate transgenic lines were established. Transgenic mice for human wild-type apoA-I were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (48.Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were bred with apoA-I −/− mice (22.Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Total plasma-free and esterified cholesterol was determined by enzymatic assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (49.Auerbach B.J. Parks J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10264-10270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HDL cholesterol was determined in supernatants after dextran-sulfate precipitation of plasma (50.Warnick G.R. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for the quantification of human Δ6 apoA-I, similar to that described for wild-type human apoA-I (47.Koritnik D.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that purified human Δ6 apoA-I (40.Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M. Landrum M. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for generation of the standard curve. Mouse apoA-I was quantified by slot blot analysis using a standard curve ranging from 1.5 to 100 ng of purified mouse apoA-I. Western blot was carried out as described in the next section using antibodies specific for mouse apoA-I (Biodesign Inc.). Aliquots of mouse plasma were diluted to 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and run in triplicate. Interassay variation was controlled by comparison to a standard pooled mouse plasma sample. To fractionate mouse plasma lipoproteins by size, whole mouse plasma (100 μl) was injected onto a 30-cm Superose 6 column equilibrated with 0.9% NaCl containing 0.05% EDTA, pH 7.4, and 0.05% NaN3 (51.Rudel L.L. Kelley K. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1818-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Approximately 36,500-μl fractions were collected and then analyzed for total cholesterol and apoprotein content. HDL particle size was determined using 4–30% nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (NDGGE). Aliquots of fresh whole mouse or human plasma (1–2 μl) or aliquots from individual FPLC fractions (16 μl) were run for 3000 V/h, as described previously (52.Rainwater D.L. Andres D.W. Ford A.L. Lowe W.F. Blanche P.J. Krauss R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1876-1881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were then electrotransferred to nitrocelluose filters at 35 V for 18 h in a nondenaturing transfer buffer consisting of 150 mm glycine and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. In some cases, the electrotransfer was reduced to 4 h at 35 V to optimize retention of smaller lipid-poor particles. Western analysis was carried as described previously (53.Van Driel I.R. Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using antibodies raised against human apoA-I (Chemicon), mouse apoA-I (Biodesign), or mouse apoE (Biodesign). These antibodies displayed less than 0.01% cross-reactivity. Particle diameter was determined by comparison to protein standards of known Stokes' diameter. To ascertain the apoprotein distribution after FPLC fractionation of whole plasma 16-μl aliquots were analyzed after separation on 4–30% SDS gradient gel electrophoresis. The gels were electroblotted to nitrocellulose according to standard procedures and then subjected to Western blot analysis (53.Van Driel I.R. Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified mouse wild-type apoA-I (Biodesign Inc.) and Δ6 apoA-I protein (40.Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S.

Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were radiolabeled with either 5 mCi of 131I or 125I (NEN Life Science Products), respectively, using Iodo-Beads (Pierce) according to standard procedures (54.Markwell M.A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Both radiolabeled proteins (∼7 × 106 cpm) were incubated at 4 °C with the pooled fresh whole C57BL/6J mouse plasma for 1–4 h. The plasma was injected onto a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the labeled mouse HDL was isolated by FPLC. Fractions containing the HDL peak were identified by cholesterol assay, combined, and then filtered through a Spin-X filter (0.22 μm) unit before injection. Transgenic mice (3–8-month-old males) were injected with approximately 2.0 × 105 cpm of 131I wild-type mouse HDL and 6.0 × 105 cpm of 125I Δ6 mouse HDL through a jugular vein catheter. Approximately 40 μl of blood were collected at each time point by retrorbital plexus bleeding following isoflurane administration. Blood samples were collected at 5 and 30 min, 1, 6, and 24 h into tubes containing 1 μl of 0.5m EDTA then spun at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and 20 μl of plasma was removed for radioactivity measurements using a Beckman 4000 γ counter. Fractional catabolic rates were calculated from the area under the plasma radioactivity decay curves, using a multiexponential computer curve-fitting program (55.Schwenke D.C. Carew T.E. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasma volumes were estimated as 5.77 ml/100 g of body weight (56.Wish L. Furth J. Storey R.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1950; 74: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (SUV) were prepared fromsn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine containing 0.5 μCi of 1,2-3H(N) cholesterol (50 Ci/mmol) (58 Ci/mmol) following established procedures (57.Huang C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). The lipid was dried down to remove all traces of chloroform under a stream of nitrogen then 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3 4 (SUV buffer) was added to the mixture which was then sonicated for 1 h at 4 °C. The crude SUV mixture was applied to a 20-cm Sepharose CL-4B column and fractionated. Each fraction was counted to determine the [3H]cholesterol distribution. Peak fractions were combined to obtain homogenous sized SUV. The purified SUV were then assayed for phospholipid mass (58.Fiske C.A. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Radiolabled apoA-I was prepared for use in the SUV binding assay by reacting 0.5 mCi of 125I (NEN Life Science Products) with 500 μg of either purified recombinant (wild-type or mutant Δ6) apoA-I or purified plasma apoA-I in the presence of Iodo-Beads (Pierce) according to standard procedures (54.Markwell M.A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). All traces of unincorporated label were removed by passage through a G-25 Sepharose (15-ml bed volume) column and then extensive dialysis against SUV buffer. Lowry assay (59.Lowry O.J. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 19: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) was conducted on the purified radiolabeled protein to determine the specific activity of each labeled preparation. The specific activity was defined as the radioactivity content/unit of protein mass (cpm/μg). The K d for apoA-I binding to the phospholipid vesicles was determined by adding varying amounts of radiolabeled apoA-I (0–25 μg) to 100 μg of SUV phospholipid and incubating at room temperature for 15 min (60.Yokoyama S. Fukushima D. Kupferberg J.P. Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7333-7339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing the SUV-bound apoA-I were separated from unbound labeled apoA-I using an 35-cm ACA34 spectra gel column. The total percent apoA-I recovery was calculated for each column run and ranged between 80–90%. The mass of labeled apoA-I was determined in the pooled bound and unbound apoA-I fractions by the use of each preparations' specific activity. Scatchard plots (61.Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar) were used to derive the binding constant for each apoprotein studied. For each reported K d, 6 different mass amounts of apoprotein were studied in triplicate using at least two different preparations of radiolabeled protein. The rHDL substrate for the endogenous LCAT assays was prepared at a molar ratio of 80:4:1sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:apoA-I protein and contained a trace amount of of [3H]cholesterol, as described previously (62.Parks J.S. Gebre A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 266-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoA-I used for preparing the labeled rHDL substrate was purified from human plasma and was provided by Dr. John Parks (63.Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in duplicate using ∼1.2 μg of substrate cholesterol (saturation substrate concentration) in a final concentration of 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.15 mm sodium azide, 0.6% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 4 μl of fresh mouse plasma as the source of LCAT. The reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C, and the conversion of [3H]cholesterol to [3H]cholesterol ester was determined by lipid extraction followed by thin layer chromatography (42.Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Background values were determined by omitting plasma from the reaction tube. The fractional cholesterol esterification rate was multiplied by the nmol of substrate cholesterol in the assay tube, corrected for the background, and converted to nmol cholesterol ester formed/h/ml of LCAT. Competitive solid phase immunoassays were used to assess the binding of monoclonal antibodies to either lipid-free mutant apoA-I and rHDLsn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine substrate complexes containing mutant apoA-I, as described previously (40.Sorci-Thomas M.G.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 884-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Values are given as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or ± standard error of the mean (S.E.). Statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance (ANOVA). To study the effect of deleting apoA-I repeat 6 on HDL metabolism, transgenic mice producing human Δ6 apoA-I were created and then crossed into apoA-I knockout mice. A series of mice having the Δ6 mutation and three levels of mouse apoA-I expression, TgΔ6 +/+, +/−, −/−, were then generated. Table I shows that both the plasma and HDL cholesterol concentrations dropped proportionally with the decrease in mouse apoA-I plasma levels. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay values also showed plasma Δ6 apoA-I levels dropped proportionally to mouse plasma apoA-I concentrations. The dependence of plasma Δ6 apoA-I concentration on the presence of mouse apoA-I was specific because no change was observed when human wild-type apoA-I transgenic mice (48.Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were crossed with apoA-I knockout mice (data not shown). Overall, these data suggest that plasma concentrations of Δ6 apoA-I were dependent on the presence of plasma"

There are indications that both activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and translocation of aFGF to the nucleus are of importance for mitogenesis. However, the mechanism of transport of aFGF from the cell surface to the nucleus is poorly understood. In this work we demonstrate that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase by chemical inhibitors and by expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase blocks translocation of aFGF to the cytosol and nucleus. Translocation to the cytosol and nucleus was monitored by cell fractionation, by farnesylation of aFGF modified to contain a farnesylation signal, and by phosphorylation by protein kinase C of aFGF added externally to cells. If aFGF is fused to diphtheria toxin A-fragment, it can be artificially translocated from the cell surface to the cytoplasm by the diphtheria toxin pathway. Upon further incubation, the fusion protein enters the nucleus due to a nuclear localization sequence in aFGF. We demonstrate here that upon inhibition of PI 3-kinase the fusion protein remains in the cytosol. We also provide evidence that the phosphorylation status of the fusion protein does not regulate its nucleocytoplasmic distribution.

At the cell surface, aFGF binds with high affinity to transmembrane FGF-receptors (FGFR) containing a cytoplasmic split tyrosine kinase domain. There are four different genes encoding FGFR (FGFR1–4) with several different splicing variants. aFGF also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the cell surface, although with lower affinity. Upon activation, the FGFR is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and it activates downstream effectors such as phosholipase Cγ and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The regulatory 85-kDa subunit contains several domains, among which are two SH2 (src homology 2) domains and one SH3 domain. The SH2 domains can bind specifically to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the consensus sequence pYXXM (25.Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 36.Varticovski L. Harrison-Findik D. Keeler M.L. Susa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), contained in transmembrane receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor. Binding of PI 3-kinase by its SH2 domains to such phosphorylated tyrosine residues activates the enzyme. The same consensus sequence is conserved in all four FGF receptors (44.Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and the tyrosine in this sequence of FGFR 1 was recently shown to be phosphorylated in vivo upon receptor activation (45.Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At high concentrations, a tyrosine-phosphorylated pentapeptide derived from this FGFR1 sequence was demonstrated to compete with platelet-derived growth factor receptor and v-fms for binding to PI 3-kinase in vitro (46.Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. Del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1992; 69: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, a direct interaction of FGFR and PI 3-kinase has been difficult to demonstrate (47.Vainikka S. Joukov V. Wennstrom S. Bergman M. Pelicci P.G. Alitalo K. J. Biol.

There is one recent report that in extracts from Xenopus blastulae, p85 of PI 3-kinase co-precipitates with FGFR1 (49.Ryan P.J. Paterno G.D. Gillespie L.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).PI 3-kinase is also regulated by other means. Ras can bind to the catalytic subunit and thereby activate it (50.Kodaki T.

Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Diphtheria toxin (DT) is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain that can be cleaved at a protease-sensitive site into two fragments, A and B (or DT-A and DT-B), held together by a disulfide bond. DT-B binds to diphtheria toxin receptors, and the complex is endocytosed. Triggered by the low pH in the endosomes, DT-A translocates across the endosomal membrane and reaches the cytosol, where it exerts its toxic effect by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (57.London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Experimentally, the translocation can be rapidly induced at the level of the surface membrane if cells with receptor-bound toxin are exposed to low pH, resembling the conditions in the endosomes (58.Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 828-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9068-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins, including aFGF, are capable of being translocated into cells as fusion proteins with DT-A (60.Madshus I.H. Olsnes S. Stenmark H. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3296-3302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61.Wiedlocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes S.

We have previously used this as a tool to study the intracellular role of aFGF (16.Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this work we demonstrate that PI 3-kinase activity is required both for transport of exogenously added aFGF to the cytosol and to the nuclear fraction and for accumulation in the nucleus of aFGF that has been translocated to the cytosol as a fusion protein with diphtheria toxin.DISCUSSIONThe data here presented demonstrate that two inhibitors of PI3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, inhibited transport to the cytosol and nuclear fraction of aFGF added externally to cells. Also, the drugs inhibited accumulation in the nucleus of the fusion protein aFGF-DTA that had been translocated into the cytosol by the diphtheria toxin pathway. The concentrations required to inhibit these processes suggest that in both cases, inhibition of PI 3-kinase was responsible for the effect, since most other targets for these inhibitors require higher concentrations of the drugs (25.Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 79.Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2157-2163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This notion is also substantiated by the findings that the dominant negative PI 3-kinase mutant, Δp85α, inhibited transport to the cytosol and nucleus of aFGF, as measured by phosphorylation as well as the nuclear accumulation of aFGF-DT-A.When cells with bound aFGF-DT-A fusion protein reconstituted with DT-B are exposed to low pH, the fusion protein is immediately located in the cytosol (61.Wiedlocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4835-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 82.Moskaug J.O. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2518-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete accumulation of the fusion protein in the nuclear fraction takes, however, several hours. The reason for the slow kinetics of nuclear accumulation is not clear, but the possibility that aFGF-DT-A is actually shuttling between the cytosol and nucleus is presently under investigation. If this is the case, the slow nuclear accumulation could be the result of competition between nuclear export and binding to nuclear structures retaining the fusion protein in the nucleus. In any event, nuclear accumulation of aFGF-DT-A appears to depend on the NLS of aFGF since ΔaFGF-DT-A, where this sequence has been deleted, remained in the cytosol. The NLS of aFGF has been shown to be able to direct nuclear translocation of a chimeric protein when fused to the N terminus of β-galactosidase and expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (19.Zhan X. Hu X. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, when full-length aFGF was fused to β-galactosidase, the construct remained in the cytosol, as was the case when aFGF alone was expressed (19.Zhan X. Hu X. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Exogenously added aFGF, on the other hand, was transported to the nucleus (14.Munoz R. Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).With aFGF as such, the transport pathway from the cell surface into the nucleus is not clear. It is not known whether aFGF is first translocated to the cytosol and then to the nucleus or vice versa. For the NLS of aFGF to be functional (20.Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), interaction with cytoplasmic transport proteins appears to be required, which favors the first alternative. The NLS could also function to counteract diffusion from the nucleus into the cytosol. We incubated calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells in the presence of 125I-labeled aFGF for different periods of time, fractionated the cells in membrane, cytosol, and nuclear fractions, and analyzed the fractions by SDS-PAGE. At the earliest time points, aFGF was contained in the membrane fraction. Later, it was also obtained from the nuclear fraction, and finally aFGF was found also in the cytosol fraction. 3A. Wiedlocha, unpublished results. These data argue for a transport mechanism in which aFGF is first translocated into the nucleus and then later exported to the cytosol. However, the data can also be explained by a model in which aFGF is first translocated to the cytosol and then rapidly transported from the cytosol to the nucleus, so that the concentration in the cytosol is below the detection limit in our assay. This issue requires further work.PI 3-kinase inhibition seems to interfere with nuclear localization at different steps for aFGF and aFGF-DT-A. In the case of aFGF, it appears that a transport step prior to or involved in membrane translocation is blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibition since labeled aFGF was only found in the membrane fraction in the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors and since, upon PI 3-kinase inhibition, aFGF-CAAX was not farnesylated, and aFGF was not phosphorylated. It could therefore not have reached even the cytosol.PI 3-kinase has a well established role in intracellular vesicle transport, from yeast to man. In Saccharomyces cerevisiaethe VPS34 gene product, which is the only PI 3-kinase in yeast, is involved in protein sorting to the vacuole (30.De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, PI 3-kinase is not required for the initial endocytic process but for later sorting events (26.Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A mutant platelet-derived growth factor receptor that is deficient in PI 3-kinase binding and activation did not traffic normally to the juxtanuclear region but stayed at the cell periphery (29.Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the Rab5 binding human early-endosomal autoantigen, EEA1, binds directly to PI 3-phosphate (34.Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 35.Patki V. Lawe D.C. Corvera S. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Nature. 1998; 394: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), providing a molecular link between PI 3-kinase and endosome fusion (83.Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). It is therefore quite possible that PI 3-kinase inhibition interferes with intracellular transport of aFGF at a sorting step after endocytosis. If this is the case, it can be invoked that endocytosis is required for membrane translocation of aFGF to take place. For other proteins that translocate across membranes, this is often the case as for e.g. diphtheria toxin (58.Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 828-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9068-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ricin (84.Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). There are, however, also examples of proteins that most likely are able to translocate across the cell surface membrane such as the invasive adenylate cyclase from Bordetella pertussis (85.Rogel A. Hanski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22599-22605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the VP22 protein of herpesvirus (86.Elliott G. O'Hare P.

Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It should be kept in mind that the data here presented do not rule out the possibility that the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibition is not on intracellular transport but rather on the membrane translocation process as such.The cytoplasmic retention of aFGF-DT-A observed upon PI 3-kinase inhibition could not be caused by a block in vesicle sorting since the fusion protein was translocated into the cytosol during a brief low pH treatment in the absence of wortmannin and LY294002.

The unique composition of indolicidin distinguishes it from alpha-helical and beta-structured cationic peptides, because five of indolicidin's 13 residues are tryptophans: H-Ile-Leu-Pro-Trp-Lys-Trp-Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro-Trp-Arg-Arg-NH(2). Solid phase synthesis of indolicidin gave rise to a minor byproduct that possessed unusual fluorescence and UV absorbance properties compared with authentic indolicidin. The byproduct was purified by combined ion exchange and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography steps and was shown be identical to authentic indolicidin in its microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Mass analysis of the byproduct revealed a 2-atomic mass unit reduction compared with indolicidin, suggesting the deprotonation of two indole side chains to form an intrachain delta(1),delta(1)'-ditryptophan derivative. We confirmed the nature of the cross-linked byproduct, termed X-indolicidin, by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, peptide mapping, and sequence analysis. Edman degradation revealed that Trp-6 and Trp-9 were covalently cross-linked. Compared with indolicidin, X-indolicidin was partially resistant to digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin, suggesting that the ditryptophan stabilizes a subset of molecular conformations that are protease resistant but that are absent in the native structure."

Among them, nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 is distributed most widely and its core mechanism is considered to have been conserved throughout evolution (1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). NER is driven by the coordinated action of more than a dozen proteins. These proteins are thought to form either a huge repairsome complex (2.Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) or several subcomplexes, which act cooperatively on DNA damage (3.Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). While NER is able to repair a wide variety of DNA damage in addition to UV-induced damage, most organisms also have simpler, UV damage-specific repair systems. Photoreactivation is one of those alternatives to NER, in which a single enzyme called photolyase catalyzes complete repair of UV-induced DNA damage without scissions of the phosphodiester bonds in DNA strands. Two types of photolyase that differ in substrate specificity have been described, one exclusively acting on cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) (4.Yasui A. Eker A.P. Yasuhira S. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Takao M. Oikawa A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6143-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and the other acting on (6-4) photoproducts (5.Todo T. Takemori H. Ryo H. Ihara M. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Sato K. Nomura T. Nature. 1993; 361: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6.Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the filamentous mold Neurospora crassa have another type of UV damage-specific repair system called UV-damaged DNA endonuclease (UVDE)-dependent excision repair (UVER) (7.Yajima H. Takao M. Yasuhira S. Zhao J.H. Ishii C. Inoue H. Yasui A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8.Takao M. Yonemasu R. Yamamoto K. Yasui A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4572-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this system the UVDE protein catalyzes a specific cleavage of a phosphodiester bond 5′ adjacent to a CPD or a (6-4) photoproduct. After nicking of damaged DNA, repair is thought to be completed by a base excision repair (BER)-like process (10.Yonemasu R. McCready S.J. Murray J.M. Osman F. Takao M. Yamamoto K. Lehmann A.R. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to photolyase, a single type of UVDE can recognize both CPDs and (6-4) photoproducts, which have been considered to have significantly different conformation. The reason for the existence of multiple repair pathways for UV damage is not fully understood. One might think that UV-specific pathways such as photoreactivation or UVER are only a backup to NER and functionally redundant, or that they are just remnants of primitive repair systems that existed when UV irradiation was much stronger than today. However, it is difficult to imagine that such a completely redundant pathway would have been maintained for long during evolution. The most likely possibility is that these multiple pathways have partially overlapping but also differentiated functions. Multiple organelles harboring their own genomes exist in most eukaryotes. These organelles have fundamental roles in respiration or photosynthesis, and the gene products encoded by their genomes are essential for these biochemical events. Therefore, these genomes should be protected by DNA repair systems, as are nuclear genomes, from harmful DNA damage. Photoreactivation has been reported to function in mitochondria or in chloroplasts in some species. In the green algaEuglena gracilis, UV irradiation induces the appearance of white color colonies consisting of cells lacking chloroplasts in addition to cell killing. This “bleached” colony induction is known to be photoreactivable (11.Nicolas P. Hussein Y. Heizmann P. Nigon V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). UV irradiation also causes induction of petite colonies lacking mitochondria with remarkably high efficiency in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Petite induction is also alleviated by photoreactivation of UV damage in mitochondrial DNA (12.Waters R. Moustacchi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 366: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13.Prakash L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our previous results showed that the N-terminal protruding sequence of S. cerevisiae photolyase is crucial for its mitochondrial function (14.Yasui A. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Eker A.P. Oikawa A. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In both cases, however, NER cannot repair UV damage in organelle genomes. Although cells lacking chloroplasts or mitochondria are viable under laboratory condition, they would be expected to suffer from great disadvantage compared with wild type cells in nature. Interestingly, S. pombe totally lacks photolyase activity (15.Yasui A. Eker A.P. Koken M. Mutat. Res. 1989; 217: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and instead possesses UVDE. In the current study, we examined the possible function of UVER in mitochondria of S. pombe. We demonstrate that UVER works efficiently in mitochondria as well as in the nucleus by means of a repair kinetics assay and cytological observation of UVDE protein. Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All strains were grown in either YES or MM at 30 °C (16.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). Transformation of S. pombe cells was performed by electroporation with a ECM600 Electro Cell Manipulator (BTX) following the manufacturer's protocol. Double mutants were made by crossing each of the single mutants.Table IStrains used in this workStrainGenotypeY4h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32Y21h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32 rad13Δ::ura4 +Y26h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32 rad13Δ::ura4 + uvdeΔ::LEU2Y53h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32 uvdeΔ::LEU2Y61Y4/pSY8 (see Fig.2 b)Y71Y4/pSY57 (see Fig. 2 b)Y72Y4/pSY58 (see Fig. 2 b)Y73Y4/pSY59 (see Fig. 2 b)Y79Y4/pSY74 (see Fig. 2 b)Y82h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32 uvde-M1Y84h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32 uvde-M56AM64AY86h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32 uvde-M1 rad13Δ::ura4 +Y87h + ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1–32 uvde-M56AM64A rad13Δ::ura4 + Open table in a new tab Exponentially growing cells (1–2 × 107/ml) in YES liquid medium were appropriately diluted with distilled water and 500 or 10,000 cells/plate were seeded on YES agar plates. 254-nm UV was administered using a set of germicidal lamps (GL-10, Toshiba, Japan) at a dose rate of 0.4–3.3 J/m2 s. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 days, colonies were counted. Exponentially growing cells in YES medium were washed twice with distilled water and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Approximately 30 ml of cell suspension was poured into a 15-cm plastic dish (Falcon) and irradiated with 100 J/m2 254-nm UV. During the washing and UV irradiation processes cells were kept on ice and all materials were pre-chilled. For each strain, a total of 300 ml of UV irradiated cell suspension was prepared and divided into 10 aliquots. Each aliquot was centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in 30 ml of pre-warmed YES medium and incubated at 30 °C for 0, 20, 40, 60, or 120 min (two aliquots for each time point). The cells were pelleted again, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until DNA preparation. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (16.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After digestion withHindIII, DNA was treated with T4 endonuclease or mock-treated and electrophoresed under alkaline condition (17.Yasuhira S. Mitani H. Shima A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmachia Biotech). Blots were prepared in duplicate with the same DNA sample, and one was hybridized with a sense strand-specific myo2 orcoI probe the other with an antisense specific probe (see below) using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's protocol. The blots were analyzed using a FLA-2000 fluoroimage analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). The number of CPDs in the target fragment was calculated assuming Poisson distribution. After the first hybridization and analysis, the blots were incubated at 100 °C in 0.5% SDS for 5 min to remove probes and rehybridized reciprocally with the opposite strand-specific probes. A part of the myo2 gene (Ref. 18.Kitayama C. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, nucleotides 1496–2302 of GenBank Accession U75357) was amplified by PCR with primers SY78 (5′-CCCCCGGATCCCAAAGCTACTTTATTGGTATTTT-3′) and SY79 (5′-CCCCCGGATCCATTATCTCATATCTGACTCTAAA-3′) using Y4 strain genomic DNA as a template, and cloned into pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene). Strand-specific probes were generated by asymmetric PCR using the cloned fragment as a template and either SY78 or SY79 as a primer (19.Konat G.W. Laszkiewicz I. Grubinska G. Wiggins R.C. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology: Current Innovations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 37-42Google Scholar). After the PCR reaction, the probe was purified by passing through G-50. Approximately 3 × 106 cpm/ml was used for hybridization. For coI strand-specific probes, a part of the gene (nucleotides 4901–5405 of GenBank accession no. X54421) was PCR-amplified with primers SY61 (5′-CCCCCGGATCCACTTATGTTAATAGATGGATATTCT-3′) and SY62 (5′-CCCCCGGATCCAAGTTAGTAATCTTTTTACTAGT-3′) and similarly labeled. Subcelluar localization of UVDE was predicted by PSORTII, which is available on the Internet (20.Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Theuvde-M1 mutation was introduced into the cloned genomic fragment with a Mutan-Express Km kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and SY96 (5′-CGTTTTCATTTTTTAAAGCTTAGGCTATTG-3′). This mutation disrupts the first methionine codon of the uvde and creates aHindIII site. The uvde-M56AM64A mutation, which converts the second and the third methionine codons to alanine codons, was introduced by PCR-based method with SY95 (5′-TGCCCACCTCCTCGAGATGAGATTG-3′), SY101 (5′-GTTTACTTCCAGCGAGCTCAAAAACCACACTCTCAGCGTTACCGCAAG-3′), SY102 (5′-CTTGTCGATATCTCTTTTCACTTAC-3′), and SY103 (5′-TGAGCTCGCTGGAAGTAAACTTTTAAGGGT-3′). Sequences were verified using a DSQ-1000 DNA sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The EGFPgene from a pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) vector together with its original multicloning site was isolated and inserted into theXhoI and SmaI sites of pREP4X (21.Forsburg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This plasmid was named pSY8. Wild type, 5′-truncated, or point mutated versions ofuvde were cloned into the SacII andBamHI sites of pSY8 so that C-terminal GFP fusion protein was expressed from a nmt1 full-strength promoter (see Fig.2 b, pSY57–59, pSY74). When PCR was used in plasmid construction, sequences of the amplified region were verified. S. pombe transformants harboring either of these constructs were maintained in MM + thiamine (5 μg/ml) medium to minimize the toxicity due to overexpression of the fusion protein. Prior to microscopic observation, exponentially growing transformants were washed once with water, diluted 50–100-fold into thiamine-free MM and cultured at 30 °C for 16 h. The subcellular localization of UVDE-GFP fusion protein was observed by using Leica DM LB microscope (Leica, Germany) with an appropriate filter for GFP. Gene replacement was conducted by a pop-in/pop-out method (16.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) usingura4 + as the selectable marker. The mutateduvde gene and ura4 + marker are subcloned next to each other into a ars-less vector. The plasmid was integrated into the uvde locus and targeted integration was confirmed by Southern hybridization. This strain was cultured in YES medium for several generations and plated on MM + 5-FOA plates for selection against ura4 marker. The pop-out event was checked by Southern hybridization and the nucleotide sequences of replaced region were confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified fragment. It has been reported that photolyase inS. cerevisiae functions in mitochondria as well as in the nucleus and that it actually contributes to the reduction of the petite induction rate by UV irradiation (12.Waters R. Moustacchi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 366: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13.Prakash L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14.Yasui A. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Eker A.P. Oikawa A. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). While S. cerevisiae cells do not possess UVER, S. pombe lacks any detectable photoreactivation of UV damage. Each repair system depends on a single protein, photolyase or UVDE. This complementary relationship between two repair pathways in the two yeast species prompted us to examine whether UVER functions in the mitochondria ofS. pombe cells. We first looked at CPD removal from the myo2 locus on the nuclear genome and the coI locus on the mitochondrial genome by using a T4 endonuclease-based strand-specific damage assay. These loci encode a type II myosin heavy chain and a cytochrome oxidase subunit I, respectively. When digested with HindIII, these loci give rise to a 4.1- or a 4.3-kilobase pair signal in Southern hybridization experiments with the appropriate probes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Wild type cells were able to repair CPDs in both loci quite efficiently (Fig.1, WT). The repair kinetics were not remarkably affected when functional NER was eliminated by the disruption of rad13, XPG/RAD2 homolog of S. pombe (22.Carr A.M. Sheldrick K.S. Murray J.M. al-Harithy R. Watts F.Z. Lehmann A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that UVER operates both in the nucleus and mitochondria (Fig. 1, rad13Δ). When UVER was eliminated, CPDs in the myo2 locus were removed with a clear strand bias (Fig. 1, uvdeΔ, left column) Transcription-coupled repair by NER in S. pombe was described elsewhere (23.Yasuhira S. Morimyo M. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26822-26827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, NER did not repair damage at thecoI locus during the 120 min incubation time (Fig. 1,uvdeΔ, right column) indicating that NER does not function in mitochondria. Strains lacking both types of excision repair did not show any ability to repair damage at either locus (Fig. 1,rad13Δ uvdeΔ). UVER is initiated by the nicking of damaged DNA by UVDE (7.Yajima H. Takao M. Yasuhira S. Zhao J.H. Ishii C. Inoue H. Yasui A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8.Takao M. Yonemasu R. Yamamoto K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In order for UVER to repair damage on the mitochondrial genome, UVDE itself should exist in mitochondria. Therefore, we next examined the subcellular localization of UVDE. The uvde + nucleotide sequence possesses three putative initiation methionine codons, Met-1, Met-56, and Met-64 at its N terminus (Fig. 2 a). Scanning of the full-length UVDE amino acid sequence (599 amino acids) with PSORTII program (20.Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) picked up features of a mitochondrial protein between the first and the second methionines, as well as motifs for nuclear localization after the third methionine (Fig. 2 a). The full-length protein was predicted to be mitochondrial with a score of 56.5%, while the N-terminal truncated version in which the sequence preceding the second methionine was removed (544 amino acids) was predicted to be nuclear with a score of 65.2%. These sequence features suggest that alternative usage of two or three methionine codons for translation initiation may target UVDE to two different organelles. We then observed the localization of ectopically expressed UVDE-GFP fusion protein microscopically. Typical mitochondria in S. pombe appear as a stringlike structure, as has been shown (24.Robinow C.F. Hyams J.S. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., London1989: 273-330Crossref Google Scholar,25.Yaffe M.P. Harata D. Verde F. Eddison M. Toda T. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11664-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Wild type UVDE-GFP was localized to both nucleus and mitochondria (Fig. 2 b, pSY57), which is consistent with the repair kinetics result (Fig. 1, WT). In contrast, UVDE-GFP expressed from the second or the third methionine codons was observed exclusively in nucleus (Fig. 2 b, pSY58 andpSY59). We also expressed the mutant version of UVDE-GFP, where both the second and the third methionine codons were replaced with alanine codons. This mutation would repress the translation initiation from these two sites and consequently repress targeting to the nucleus. As expected, the mutant UVDE-GFP was localized only to mitochondria (Fig. 2 b, pSY74). All of the wild type and mutant versions of UVDE-GFP fusion proteins were functional as UVDE in a repair-deficient Escherichia coli-based survival assay (7.Yajima H. Takao M. Yasuhira S. Zhao J.H. Ishii C. Inoue H. Yasui A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Cytological observation of ectopically expressed UVDE-GFP suggested an alternative usage of two or three methionine initiation codons for targeting of this protein to multiple organelles. We next introduced the same mutations into the chromosomal copy of the uvde gene and studied its effect on repair kinetics of myo2 andcoI loci in NER-deficient (rad13Δ) background. When the first methionine was disrupted, UVER repaired damage only at the myo2 locus (Fig. 3,rad13Δ uvde-M1). When the second and the third methionine codons were replaced with alanine codons, UVER operated only on the coI locus (Fig. 3, rad13Δuvde-M56AM64A) as anticipated. As shown above, UVER is the only excision repair system for UV damage in the mitochondrial genome of S. pombe. To evaluate its relative significance in damage repair in nucleus and mitochondria, we examined the UV survival of the strains whose nuclear or mitochondrial UVER was selectively inactivated. When mitochondrial UVER was eliminated, UV survival was apparently unchanged (Fig. 4, a (uvde-M1) and b (rad13Δ uvde-M1)). On the other hand, inactivation of nuclear UVER (uvde-M56AM64A) rendered the cells sensitive to UV almost to the same degree as complete inactivation of UVER (Fig. 4, a (uvde-M56AM64A) and b (rad13Δ uvde-M56AM64A)). The result was the same whether or not NER was functional. The surviving colonies of the mitochondrial UVER-deficient strains did not show any retardation growth, and therefore were not considered to have respiration defect. Although UVER efficiently works on UV damage in the mitochondrial genome, its mitochondrial function may not contribute to UV resistance of S. pombe cells. There are many examples of products of a single gene localized to several different intracellular compartments (26.Danpure C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 230-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A variety of mechanisms are responsible for this multiple localization, such as variable pre-mRNA processing (including alternative splicing), transcription initiation at multiple sites, translation initiation at multiple sites, or variable post-translational modification, depending on each case. The S. pombe uvde + gene possesses three putative initiation methionine codons at its N terminus and the amino acid sequence preceding the third methionine is dispensable for its enzymatic activity (8.Takao M. Yonemasu R. Yamamoto K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be confirmed by direct examination of N-terminal sequence of the protein, our repair kinetics and cytological data in the present study strongly suggest that multiple subcellular localization of UVDE is accomplished by translation initiation at multiple methionine start codons. According to Zhang and Marr (27.Zhang M.Q. Marr T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the most conserved nucleotide around translation initiation sites in S. pombe is A at −3 position. None of the three methionine codons at the N terminus of UVDE meet this criterion (T for the first and the third methionine codons, and C for the second methionine codon). The absence of any strongly preferred translation initiation sites may enable the usage of multiple sites. In the present study, we demonstrated that UVER efficiently removes UV damage on the mitochondrial genome as well as on the nuclear genome. This means that, after nicking of damaged DNA by UVDE, two independent but analogous mechanisms may complete the repair reaction in the respective organelles. We previously showed that at least a part of UVER is dependent on Rad2p (10.Yonemasu R. McCready S.J. Murray J.M. Osman F. Takao M. Yamamoto K. Lehmann A.R. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a FEN-1 homolog of S. pombe, which has also been implicated in a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent subpathway of BER (28.Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that UVER and BER share their later steps in nuclei. On the other hand, recent several works unequivocally showed the existence of BER in mitochondria probably involving DNA polymerase γ and mitochondrial DNA ligase (29.Slupphaug G. Markussen F.H. Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Aarsaether N. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2579-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30.Takao M. Aburatani H. Kobayashi K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 31.Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although Rad2p itself is unlikely to be involved in mitochondrial BER (and UVER) judging from its amino acid sequence, it is highly possible that UVER and BER share some steps also in mitochondria. As mentioned above, the lack of mitochondrial DNA repair increases the rate of petite induction by UV in S. cerevisiae (12.Waters R. Moustacchi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 366: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13.Prakash L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We expected that inactivation of mitochondrial DNA repair would lead to an increased sensitivity of S. pombe to UV, since this species has been long regarded as a petite-negative yeast and loss of the mitochondrial genome was thought to result in cell death (but also see Refs. 32.Haffter P. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1992; 131: 255-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 33.Massardo D.R. Manna F. Schafer B. Wolf K. Del Giudice L. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, our results demonstrated that the defect in mitochondrial UVER does not affect the UV survival. The first question is why apparent absence of DNA repair in mitochondria of the mutant S. pombe strains does not lead to an increased UV sensitivity. Two explanations for this will be possible. One is that any types of DNA damage tolerance systems in mitochondria are irrelevant to UV resistance of S. pombecells. The other is that other type(s) of damage tolerance mechanisms in mitochondria (which should not be damage repair in a true sense, since we did not observe any damage removal in the absence of UVER) mask the effect of UVER. Since the size of the nuclear genome is much larger and the copy number is much lower than those of the mitochondrial genome, one can easily imagine that the nuclear genome would be much more sensitive to the same number of damage per unit length of DNA than the mitochondrial genome. Under such conditions, cells will die before the effect of the damage tolerance system in the mitochondria is realized. This way of argument supports the former explanation. In our experimental condition, however, 100 J/m2 UV induced about 10 CPDs in a single copy of S. pombe mitochondrial genome in average (data not shown). Taking into account that the copy number of mitochondrial genome is several hundred at most (34.Bostock C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 195: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this means that virtually any DNA molecules of mitochondrial genome bear at least a few CPDs. At this UV dose, about 50% of wild type and mitochondrial UVER-deficient cells are still survived (Fig. 4 a). We also know from earlier work that CPDs are a strong barrier to DNA replication and transcription in the absence of any damage tolerance systems (35.Stacks P.C. White J.H. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36.Berger C.A. Edenberg H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37.Klocker H.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This argues that the former explanation is very unlikely, and suggests the possible existence of other types of damage tolerance systems in the mitochondria of S. pombe. Ling et al. (39.Ling F. Makishima F. Morishima N. Shibata T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4090-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) described how, in S. cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA, recombination has a important role in damage tolerance. If a similar mechanism operates in the mitochondria of S. pombe, it would be a good candidate for major mitochondrial damage tolerance. This should be examined in a future study. In the Introduction, we argued that completely redundant mechanisms cannot be maintained during evolution. Following this argument, mitochondrial UVER is expected to give an advantage at least under some condition. The second question is what conditions would these be? In contrast to UV, reactive oxygen species generated by respiration may cause the damage preferentially in mitochondrial DNA. In this case mitochondrial DNA repair would have a greater significance than for UV damage. Recently we identified an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity of UVDE (40.Kanno S. Iwai S. Takao M. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This may suggest a possible involvement of UVER in repair of oxidative damage on mitochondrial DNA and its contribution to cell survival. Although we have not found any increased sensitivity of uvde-disrupted cells against oxidative damage, this possibility remains to be elucidated. The copy number of the mitochondrial genome is known to fluctuate depending on culture conditions. In S. cerevisiae, a well known phenomenon, glucose repression, also includes a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number (41.Ulery T.L. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1160-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is quite reasonable since, if a carbon source is abundant, energy generation does not have to depend solely on respiration. Additionally, earlier work on S. pombe showed that the mitochondrial DNA content in exponentially growing cell is much lower than that in stationary phase cells (34.Bostock C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 195: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As discussed above, when the mitochondrial DNA copy number is lower, mitochondrial DNA would have a greater significance. Mitochondrial UVER might be crucial under such conditions. At this moment, we do not have any positive evidence for this. We thank Drs. T. Shibata and T. D. Fox for information on petite induction in S. pombe andptp1–1 strain. We also thank Dr. A. K. Hopper for information on multi-compartmentalized proteins from a single gene."

The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain has about 23% identity to that of erythropoietin. This domain contains two disulfide bridges, located between Cys-7 and Cys-151 and between Cys-29 and Cys-85, which are essential for displaying full biological activity (11.Kato T. Ozawa T. Muto T. Inagaki Y. Shimada Y. Iwamatsu A. Kadoya T. Matsumoto A. Horie K. Maeda E. Yamada Y. Kawagishi M. Tahara T. Kokubo A. Ogami K. Kuroki R. Kawamura K. Sohma Y. Ohashi H. Miyazaki H.

Truncated versions of TPO containing the N-terminal region, such as purified molecules from plasma or recombinant molecules, are known to be biological active (1.de Sauvage F.J. Hass P.E.

Matsumura M. Todokoro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region has a character that is quite distinct from other excreted growth factors. This domain contains six N-linked sugar sites and a large number of prolines, serines, and threonines. Some membrane-anchored growth factors, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), c-kit ligand, tumor necrosis factor-α, and epidermal growth factor family, have been known to contain membrane anchoring regions (14.Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Truncation mutagenesis of this region in M-CSF did not affect in vitroactivity (15.Kawasaki E.S. Ladner M.B. Dexter T.M. Garland J.M. Testa N.G. Colony-Stimulating Factors: Molecular and Cellular Biology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 155-176Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal domain of TPO does not have a hydrophobic transmembrane region like that of M-CSF. What is the biological function of this unique C-terminal domain? It was speculated that the enhancement of the circulating half-life might be one function of this domain, as in the case of EPO (10.Gurney A.L. Kuang W.-J. Xie M.-H. Malloy B.E. Eaton D.L. de Sauvage F.J. Blood. 1995; 85: 981-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than this, at least two possibilities can be considered for the function of the C-terminal tail peptide. The first possibility is that some part of the sequence in the C-terminal domain contains a peptide region that is important for TPO activity. Another possibility is that the C-terminal domain is important for the secretion of TPO. To test these hypotheses, two series of mutation experiments were performed. One is the systematic truncation of the C-terminal domain. Another is the elimination ofN-glycosylation sites in the C-terminal domain by replacing glycosylated asparagines with glutamines. The effect of these mutations on the secretion and function of TPO was investigated. It was found that the C-terminal domain plays an important role in the secretion of TPO. The expression plasmid of wild type TPO, pHTF1, which included the full-length (amino acids 1–332) hTPO cDNA has been described previously (8.Kato T. Ogami K. Shimada Y. Iwamatsu A. Sohma Y. Akahori H. Horie K. Kokubo A. Kudo Y. Maeda E. Kobayashi K. Ohashi H. Ozawa T. Inoue H. Kawamura K. Miyazaki H. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The construction of truncated genes was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). N-Glycosylation sites were eliminated by site directed mutagenesis (Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit,CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). All mutant genes were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 373A nucleotide sequencer. The expression vectors were transfected into COS7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (8.Kato T. Ogami K. Shimada Y. Iwamatsu A. Sohma Y. Akahori H. Horie K. Kokubo A. Kudo Y. Maeda E. Kobayashi K. Ohashi H. Ozawa T. Inoue H. Kawamura K. Miyazaki H. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 16.Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Conditioned medium was collected after 5 days of growth. TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR assay was performed according to the literature (17.Hirayama Y. Sakamaki S. Matsunaga T. Kuga T. Kuroda H. Kusakabe T. Sasaki K. Fujikawa K. Kato J. Kogawa K. Koyama R. Niitsu Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Total RNA was recovered from COS7 cells using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo) and subjected to reverse transcription, quantitative PCR using TaqMan Gold reverse transcription PCR kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. About 2 ng of total RNA was converted to cDNA using 1.25 units of multiscrive reverse transcriptase. The target PCR primers T-5 (forward, 5′-TGC TTC GTG ACT CCC ATG TC-3′) and T-6 (reverse, 5′-CCC AGA ATG TCC TGT GCC TT-3′), as well as the TaqMan probe, were added to the cDNA solution and transferred to a thermocycler tube. The TaqMan probe (5′-FAM-TTC ACA GCA GAC TGA GCC AGT GCC C-TAMRA-3′, PE Applied Biosystems) contains the reporter dyes FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) and TAMRA (6-carboxy-4,5-dichloro-2,7-dimethoxyfluorescein) on the 5′ and 3′ nucleotides, respectively. Target and internal control (TaqMan ribosomal RNA control reagents, Applied Biosystems) were reverse-transcribed at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by up to 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min, and the amplified products were monitored by using a sequence detector model 7700 (Applied Biosystems). The TPO mutant protein in the supernatant from COS7 cells was purified by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-hTPO polyclonal antibody (18.Tahara T. Usuki K. Sato H. Ohashi H. Morita H. Tsumura H. Matsumoto A. Miyazaki H. Urabe A. Kato T. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Multigel 10/20 or 15/25 (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as described by Laemmli (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). To detect the mutant TPO remaining in the COS7 cells, total cellular protein was also separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In both cases, mutant TPO was detected by Western blot analysis. The protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and incubated with biotinylated anti-TPO polyclonal antibody and then with streptavidine conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TPO bands were visualized by developing with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad). Concentration of mutant TPO in the supernatant of COS7 cells was determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In order to accurately determine the concentration of truncated mutants, two independent types of ELISAs were used: one with anti-hTPO polyclonal antibodies and another with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize different epitopes of hTPO. The in vitro biological activity of TPO mutants was determined with the TPO-dependent cell line FDCP-hMPL5 (20.Miyakawa Y. Oda A. Druker B.J. Miyazaki H. Handa M. Ohashi H. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 439-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Morita H. Tahara T. Matsumoto A. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Ohashi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cell line was established by transfecting human c-mpl cDNA into murine cell line FDC-P2, which was interleukin-3-, interleukin-4-, and GM-CSF-dependent. The assay procedure was as follows. FDCP-hMPL5 cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were placed in the 96-well tissue culture plate at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well, and a TPO standard or unpurified culture medium with secreted mutant was added. The plates were placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. After 3 days of incubation, the proliferation of FDCP-hMPL5 cells was measured with the absorbance at 490 nm using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS, Promega Corp.). The C-terminal domain contains six potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. They are at positions 176, 185, 213, 234, 319, and 327, as shown in Fig. 1. We chose to truncate the C terminus in steps of 20 amino acids. In this strategy, most of theN-linked sugar chains were deleted independently (Fig.1 a). The truncation was stopped at Cys-151 because the corresponding residue in human EPO, Cys-161, is required to display biological activity (22.Eliott S. Chang D. Delorme E. Dunn C. Egrie J. Giffin J. Lorenzini T. Talbot C. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2714-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to eliminate N-linked sugar chains of hTPO, glycosylated asparagines were replaced by glutamine (Fig. 1 b). The mutations were introduced individually and in combination. The wild type and mutant TPOs were expressed in COS7 cells with the DEAE-dextran method. All mutants were secreted from COS7 cells. Shifts in the molecular weight were observed according to their truncated length (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, shifts in the molecular weight of glycosylation site elimination mutants were observed according to the number of N-linked sugar chains eliminated (Fig. 2 B). The TPO mutants were observed as broad bands even in the glycosylation site elimination mutants, which is considered to be because of the heterogeneity of theN- and O-linked glycosylation. This heterogeneity is usually seen in the other glycoproteins, such as EPO (23.Yamaguchi K. Akai K. Kawanishi G. Ueda M. Masuda S. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20434-20439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Delorme E. Lorenzini T. Giffin J. Martin F. Jacobsen F. Boone T. Elliott S.

Blood. 1995; 85: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GM-CSF (26.Cebon J. Nicola N. Ward M. Gardner I. Dempsey P. Layton J. Dührsen U. Burgess A.W. Nice E. Morstyn G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4483-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion level of TPO mutants in COS cell was determined by ELISA using wild type as a standard and expressed in molarity based on the peptide portion. The amount of mutant TPO estimated by ELISA was in good agreement with the results of Western blot analysis. The estimated concentrations of secreted mutants are summarized in Fig.3. The secretion levels of the truncated mutants decreased as more of the C terminus was truncated (Fig.3 A), although the expression level of the three mutants, TPO311, TPO291, and TPO271, was almost the same as wild type (∼35 nm). The secretion level decreased progressively down to 110 that of wild type TPO. The secretion level of TPO251 was about half that of wild type (22 nm). Finally when 181 residues were removed, the secretion level of TPO151 decreased down to less than 5 nm. Contrary to what would be expected if the mRNA level (shown in Fig. 3) caused the decrease in expression, preliminary analysis indicated that truncation of the C-terminal region tends to result in an increase in mRNA level. The expression level, therefore, seems to depend on the length of the C-terminal region containing six N-glycosylation sites. How does the N-glycosylation itself affect the secretion level of TPO? The secretion levels of the glycosylation site elimination mutants were investigated, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3 B. The secretion level decreased progressively with the elimination of N-linked sugar chains. The secretion level of the wild type, TPOQ1, and TPOQ56mutants were approximately 40 nm. The secretion level of the mutants TPOQ2, TPOQ3, and TPOQ4, in which one N-linked sugar chain was eliminated, were approximately 30 nm. Finally, the secretion level of the mutant lacking all N-linked sugar sites (TPOQ123456) was only about 5 nm, which was almost 18 that of wild type. The secretion level of truncated mutant (TPO151) was almost the same as that of the mutant lacking all N-glycosylation sites (TPOQ123456), indicating that elimination of the glycosylation site is the major factor in decreasing expression in the truncation mutants. Preliminary mRNA analyses of the glycosylation elimination mutants (Fig. 3) indicated that elimination ofN-glycosylation sites did not decrease the mRNA level, supporting the importance of glycosylation in secretion of TPO. In order to complement the investigation of the secretion level of mutant TPO, the amount of unsecreted protein was investigated by Western blotting analysis. Fig. 4 shows the result of Western blotting analysis of the unsecreted TPO. Equal amounts of cell suspension were loaded in each lane. The amount of unsecreted TPO clearly increased with increasing truncation from the C terminus (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were observed in the elimination of N-linked sugar chains (Fig. 4 B). From the molecular size, it seems that there are no N-linked sugar chains attached to the unsecreted protein. Therefore, heterogeneity of the bands seems to be only from theO-linked glycosylation. The existence of theN-linked sugar chains of the C-terminal region is clearly important for the secretion of TPO. The effect of the C-terminal region on the biological activity is of interest. Thein vitro biological activity of both truncated and glycosylation site elimination mutants was measured by the FDCP-hMPL5 cell proliferation assay (21.Morita H. Tahara T. Matsumoto A. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Ohashi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results are summarized in TableI. The activity of mutant TPOs was indicated by relative activity, with wild type set at 100%. The truncated mutants, except for TPO150, showed biological activity in a dose-dependent manner. The truncated mutant TPO150 lacking Cys-151 was inactive. The specific activity of TPO mutants, calculated using the two independent ELISA systems, was found to be elevated with increasing truncation of the C-terminal region. Full-length TPO displayed an ED50 value of 40 pm in the proliferation assay, whereas ED50values for the mutants TPO171, TPO163, and TPO157, decreased to 12 pm, indicating that the short forms of TPO are more than three times more active than the wild type (TPO332).Table IBiological activities of truncated and glycosylation site elimination mutant TPO expressed in COS7 cellsMutantED50aED50 values are the concentrations producing 50% of the maximum biological activity.Relative activitybRelative activities are expressed as the activity of the wild type (WT) equal to 100%.pm%Truncated mutants WT (332)38.7100 31130.0129 29127.2142 27132.6118 25126.6146 23118.6208 21119.6197 19116.2238 17111.8326 16311.7329 15711.7331 15118.1214 150NDcND, not detected.NDGlycosylation site elimination mutants WT (332)44.1100 Q136.9120 Q234.3129 Q344.1100 Q452.983 Q5641.6106 Q45629.6149 Q345649.689 Q2345645.597 Q12345643.4102a ED50 values are the concentrations producing 50% of the maximum biological activity.b Relative activities are expressed as the activity of the wild type (WT) equal to 100%.c ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The specific activity of glycosylation site elimination mutants revealed different features from the truncated mutants. As shown in Table I, all nine glycosylation site elimination mutants displayed almost the same in vitro biological activity as that of the wild type (TPO332), indicating that the existence of theN-linked sugar chain does not affect the biological activity. Because the biological activity of glycosylation site elimination TPO was approximately 13 that of the TPO163, the C-terminal peptide region of TPO somehow inhibits the TPO activity. The in vitro biological activity of the truncated mutants showed an increase of up to 4-fold (see Table I). Two reasons can be considered for this activation. One is that N-linked glycosylation inhibits the receptor binding. Another possible reason is inhibition of activity by the C-terminal peptide itself. Previous studies showed that the removal of the N-linked sugar chains results in an enhancement of the in vitro biological activity of EPO (23.Yamaguchi K. Akai K. Kawanishi G. Ueda M. Masuda S. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20434-20439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GM-CSF (26.Cebon J. Nicola N. Ward M. Gardner I. Dempsey P. Layton J. Dührsen U. Burgess A.W. Nice E. Morstyn G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4483-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutants lackingN-linked sugar sites have activity similar to that of the wild type (TPO332), suggesting that N-linked glycosylation does not affect the biological activity. Therefore, an increase in TPO activity is considered to be due to the removal of the peptide chain, possibly eliminating an unfavorable interaction with the TPO receptor (Mpl). The systematic truncation of the C-terminal peptide clearly results in progressively increasing biological activity. The biological activities and the secretion levels of mutants and the hydropathy of wild type TPO are plotted against the residue number in Fig. 5. It was found that the TPO mutants having more than 250 residues showed the same activity, which was about ¼ of the maximum activity seen in the truncated TPO mutants, such as TPO157, TPO163, and TPO171. The interval between N-glycosylation sites at positions 234 and 319 contains an obvious hydrophobic region from residue 270 to 300 (see Fig. 5). Because the N-terminal functional domain of TPO has been proposed to be extremely hydrophobic (8.Kato T. Ogami K. Shimada Y. Iwamatsu A. Sohma Y. Akahori H. Horie K. Kokubo A. Kudo Y. Maeda E. Kobayashi K. Ohashi H. Ozawa T. Inoue H. Kawamura K. Miyazaki H. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), this hydrophobic region in C-terminal region may associate with the N-terminal domain of TPO to inhibit TPO association with the receptor. It may be noted that there is a dibasic site (Arg-Arg) located at positions 244 and 245 and that the proteolysis at this dibasic site can remove the hydrophobic region in the C-terminal peptide (27.Kato T. Oda A. Inagaki Y. Ohashi H. Matsumoto A. Ozaki K. Miyakawa Y. Watarai H. Fuju K. Kokubo A. Kadoya T. Ikeda Y. Miyazaki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4669-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is now clear that the C-terminal domain of TPO is important for effective secretion and that the N-glycosylation is the main factor in improving the secretion. A decrease in the secretion level after removing N-linked sugar chains was also reported in other glycosylated cytokines, such as EPO (23.Yamaguchi K. Akai K. Kawanishi G. Ueda M. Masuda S. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20434-20439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Delorme E. Lorenzini T. Giffin J. Martin F. Jacobsen F. Boone T. Elliott S.

Blood. 1995; 85: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and interferon-γ (28.Sareneva T. Pirhonen J. Cantell K. Kalkkinen N. Julkunen I. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in which the sugar chain is thought to reduce the susceptibility to proteases during secretion and to be involved in correct folding (29.Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of N-linked sugar chains to the secretion of TPO could not be identified. The glycosylated C-terminal region may act as a molecular chaperon to help folding and transportation of the N-terminal domain through organella. Moreover, the C-terminal region seems to have a biochemically important character for effective glycosylation. The C-terminal region is very hydrophilic in comparison with the N-terminal domain (Fig. 5). The existence of many helix-breaking residues, such as proline and glycine, also suggests that this region is unstructured, which is supported by the results of secondary structure prediction, as well as the fact that the existence of C-terminal region does not contribute to the CD spectra (data not shown). Because N-linked glycosylation is usually found in flexible loop regions (30.Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar), the unstructured C-terminal region may allow efficient glycosylation. The systematic truncation and elimination of theN-glycosylation sites further clarified the most importantN-glycosylation sites for TPO secretion. The six sites ofN-linked glycosylation can be divided into three groups (Groups I–III) according to location and effect on secretion. Group I involves the N-linked glycosylation sites at 176 and 185, Group II involves the sites at 213 and 234, and the Group III involves the sites at 319 and 327 (see Fig. 5). Truncation or elimination of Group III still showed the same secretion level as the wild type, whereas the removal of the N-linked sugar chain of Group II caused a large decrease of the secretion level (Fig. 3). TheN-linked glycosylation site of Group I showed only a slight decrease in secretion of mutant TPO. Therefore, the N-linked glycosylation belonging to Group III (positions 319 and 327) is not necessary for the effective secretion of TPO. It also indicates that the N-linked glycosylation belonging to Group II is most important for the secretion of TPO. Because TPOs have been cloned from five species, human (1.de Sauvage F.J. Hass P.E.

Blood. 1995; 85: 981-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the N-glycosylation sites of their C termini can be compared. Although high sequence homology (83% sequence identity between human and porcine) is found in the N-terminal domain, there is less identity in the C-terminal domains (67% identity) (1.de Sauvage F.J. Hass P.E. Spencer S.D. Malloy B.E. Gurney A.L. Spencer S.A. Darbonne W.C. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Kuang W.-J. Oles K.J. Hultgren B. Solberg Jr., L.A. Goeddel D.V. Eaton D.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). There are 6, 7, 8, 5, and 6 N-glycosylation sites in the C-terminal domain of TPO from human, murine, canine, rat, and porcine, respectively. The conserved sites for N-glycosylation among TPOs from these five species correspond to the first four sites of hTPO at positions 176, 185, 213, and 234 belonging to Group I and II in humans. The conservation of the N-glycosylation in these TPOs supports our finding that the Group II N-glycosylation sites are most important for secretion of TPO. The finding that the existence of the C-terminal region increases the secretion level of TPO may provide a useful approach to improving the secretion level of other proteins by adding a sugar-rich, “shuttle” peptide tail."

Northern blotting and reporter assay demonstrated that this induction was due to PE stimulation of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability. To further define the underlying mechanism, we prepared a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-p21 waf1/cip1 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) hybrid construct by inserting the 3′-UTR of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA just downstream from the CAT coding sequence and transfected it into TFG2 cells. PE treatment enhanced the activity of this construct by 6-fold. Deletion analyses indicated that an AU-rich element (AURE) located between 553 to 625 within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR was required for this induction.

The expression of the p21 waf1/cip1 gene is controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (17.Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1998; 20: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The transcriptional control of p21 waf1/cip1 has been extensively investigated. It has been reported that the transcription of p21 waf1/cip1 can be induced by p53 and other transcription factors, including E2F, AP2, Sp1, BRCA1, Smad, C/EBPα, STAT family, IRF-1, androgen receptor, RB-binding protein, etc. (for review, see Ref. 17.Gartel A.L.

Recent evidence suggests that posttranscriptional mechanisms also play an important role in the control of the p21 waf1/cip1 gene expression. For example, posttranscriptional mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of p21 waf1/cip1 gene expression by epidermal growth factor (18.Johannessen L.E. Knardal S.L. Madshus I.H. Biochem.

The supernatant was collected as cytosol fraction and stored at −80 °C. The sense RNA probe used in RMSA was obtained byin vitro transcription of a polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragment designed to have a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at its 5′ end. For generating the RNA probe corresponding the region from 553 to 625 in the 3′-UTR of the p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA, the downstream primer was 5′-GGG TAT GTA CAT GAG GAG GTG-3′, the upstream primer was 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA TCT TCT GCC TTA GTC TCA G-3′. The 20 nucleotides in boldface type correspond to the T7 promoter sequence, whereas the 3′ end of the probe corresponds to the sequence between 554 and 573 of the 3′-UTR of the p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA.

The column was eluted with buffer E containing 100–800 mm KCl increased in 50 mm steps and fractions were analyzed by RMSA (see above) using 32P-labeled RNA probe. The RNA binding activity eluted at 450–500 mm KCl was pooled, dialyzed against buffer E, and loaded onto an RNA affinity column, which had been prepared by annealing sense RNA probe to poly(U)-Sepharose CL-4B beads. The sense RNA probe corresponding to the region from 553 to 625 within the 3′-UTR of the p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription of a polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragment designed to have a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at its 5′ end. The upstream primer was 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA TCT TCT GCC TTA GTC TCA G-3′. The 20 nucleotides in boldface type correspond to the T7 promoter sequence, whereas the 3′ end of the probe corresponds to the sequence 554–573 of the 3′-UTR of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA. The downstream primer was 5′-GGG TAT GTA CAT GAG GAG GTG TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT-3′. The column was washed extensively with buffer E and eluted with buffer E containing 1 m KCl. The eluate was concentrated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining as described previously (25.Gao B. Jiang L. Kunos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5997-6008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified protein (30 μg) from heparin fraction was separated by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were subsequently incubated with E buffer containing 3% nonfat dried milk and 3 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at 25 °C, and then washed twice for 10 min with E buffer containing 0.25% nonfat dried milk and hybridized with32P-labeled RNA probe for 30 min at 25 °C. The membranes were washed three times with E buffer for a total of 15 min and analyzed by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). The partially purified protein was incubated with 2 ng of the 32P-labeled RNA probe at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was irradiated under a 312-nm UV source at a distance of 1 cm, and the RNA was then digested for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 unit of RNase T1 and A (Promega). The products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging. TFG2 cells in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum were washed with DMEM, then were infected with either null recombinant adenovirus or with dominant negative MEK1 recombinant adenovirus in a total volume of 1 ml and at a multiplicity of infection of 200 as described previously (7.Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After 8 h, the cells were washed with DMEM and cultured for another 48 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Our previous results demonstrated that activation of α1BAR with PE for 24 h significantly increased p21 waf1/cip1 protein expression in TFG2 cells (7.Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, the time course of PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 protein and mRNA expression was examined. As shown in Fig. 1, PE stimulation significantly increased the p21 waf1/cip1 protein (Fig. 1 A) and mRNA (Fig. 1 B) expression, with a 3–4-fold induction noted at 4 h, whereas p53 protein (Fig. 1 A) and mRNA (Fig. 1 B) expression remained unaffected. To examine whether de novo protein synthesis is required for the PE-induced increase in p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA in TFG2 cells, cycloheximide (40 μg/ml) was used to block protein synthesis. PE-induced p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA expression was similar in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (data not shown). This indicates that PE-induced p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA expression does not require the synthesis of new protein. Next we examined the effect of PE on p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability. As shown in thetop panel of Fig. 1 C, PE stimulation significantly increased the p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability. The data from three independent experiments were plotted in the bottom panel of Fig.1 C; the half-life of the p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA in control TFG2 cells was 62 min, while after incubation with PE for 2 h the half-life was 195 min. The effect of PE on p21 waf1/cip1 gene promoter was also investigated in Fig. 1 D; PE exposure for 24 h did not significantly enhance the activity of various p21 waf1/cip1 promoter/CAT constructs. Taken together, these data suggest that PE-induced p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA expression occurs mainly through stabilization of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA. To further study the mechanism involved in the PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability, we prepared several CAT-p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR hybrid constructs by inserting various segments of the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR downstream of the CAT cDNA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2 A, the pCAT construct, which does not contain the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR, showed the highest activity, which was unaffected by PE treatment. After a 1.5-kilobase pair segment of the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR was inserted into the pCAT, the CAT activity of the resulting pCAT/p21b construct was significantly declined by 90%, while PE treatment enhanced this activity by about 6-fold. Examination of the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR sequence revealed an AURE located between 583 and 625. To identify the role of this element, we deleted it from pCAT/p21b to generate pCAT/p21b1. Surprisingly, deletion of this AU-rich element still inhibited the pCAT activity by 90%, but PE treatment only stimulates the CAT/p21b1 activity by 2-fold. Inserting the AURE alone in the pCAT construct (pCAT/p21e5 construct) did not significantly inhibit the activity of CAT, which is consistent with a previous report (21.Li X. Rishi A.K. Shao Z. Dawson M.I. Jong L. Shroot B. Richert U. Ordonez J.V. Fontana J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5055-5062PubMed Google Scholar). PE treatment did not significantly affect the pCAT/p21e5 activity. To further examine whether PE induction of the CAT activity is due to stabilization of CAT mRNA, the pCAT, pCAT/p21b, and pCAT/p21b1 constructs were transiently transfected into TFG2 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, PE treatment did not significantly affect CAT mRNA stability. Inserting the whole p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR (CAT/p21b) significantly destabilized the CAT/p21b mRNA compared with pCAT construct, PE treatment markedly enhanced the CAT/p21b mRNA stability. Inserting the mutated p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR (CAT/p21b1), in which the AURE was deleted, still significantly destabilized the CAT/p21b1 mRNA, but PE treatment did not enhance the CAT/p21b1 mRNA stability. This suggests that the AURE between 583 and 625 within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR is responsible for PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability. To further define how the AURE is involved in PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability, we performed RMSA to check whether any RNA-binding proteins specifically bind to this region. As shown in Fig.3 A, the radiolabeled RNA fragment e5 (see Fig. 2 A) corresponding to the AURE 583–625 within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR binds a major complex specifically (lane 1), as it was competed away by the unlabeled RNA probe (lane 2). Next, we purified this protein by using heparin and RNA affinity column. Fig. 3 B illustrates the use of RMSA to monitor the active reaction during purification. TFG2 cells were treated with PE for 5 h (PE treatment significantly enhanced the binding; see below), after which crude cell extracts were prepared and applied to heparin-Sepharose column and eluted by a step gradient of KCl. Five-microliter aliquots of the 1-ml fractions collected were assayed by RMSA using 32P-labeled e5 RNA probe. As shown in Fig.3 B, the AUBF binding activity was eluated at 0.45–0.5m KCl. This step enriched the AUBF binding 20-fold. The active fractions were pooled, diluted to 0.1 m KCl, and passed over an RNA affinity column (see “Experimental Procedures”). The column was eluted by 1 m KCl, and strong DNA binding activity could be detected in the eluted fraction (data not shown). This step resulted in a 250-fold purification, providing a 5,000-fold final purification over the crude extract. The fraction recovered from RNA affinity column was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Two major polypeptides of 24 and 52 kDa were identified by silver staining (Fig. 3 C,lane 2). To further verify the 24- and 52-kDa polypeptides represent the proteins that bind to RNA probe e5, UV cross-link and Northwestern analyses were performed. First, heparin-affinity-purified protein was cross-linked to 32P-labeled e5 RNA probe, followed by digesting with RNase T1 and A and resolving on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 3 D, a 24-kDa band was detected, which is identical to the 24-kDa band in the affinity-purified protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). The 52-kDa band shown in the affinity-purified protein was not detected in UV cross-link analysis. The reason for this is not clear. It is possible that UV treatment did not link the 52-kDa protein to the e5 probe well. Second, heparin-affinity purified protein was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and followed by transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane and hybridizing with a 32P-labeled e5 RNA probe. As shown in Fig. 3 E, both 24- and 52-kDa bands were detected, which is consistent with the sizes of proteins detected in the RNA affinity-purified sample in Fig. 3 C. Those results suggest that the AURE (e5 probe) within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR binds both 24- and 52-kDa polypeptides (p24/52AUBF). It has been shown that Elav-like mRNA-stabilizing proteins (HuD, HuC, HelN1, and HuR) can bind to the AU-rich element within the 3′-UTR of p21 waf1/cip1 (27.Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the PE-induced protein in TFG2 cells is such a protein. Since among the various Elav-like proteins only HuR is expressed in the liver (27.Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we tested whether HuR is involved by using an RNA gel supershift assay. As shown in Fig. 4 A, incubation of purified HuR protein with a radiolabeled RNA fragment corresponding to the region 553–625 within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR formed a strong complex, which was completely supershifted in the presence of the HuR antibody. This confirms the binding of HuR to the conserved AU-rich element within p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR. Incubation of crude extracts from PE-treated TFG2 cells with the same labeled RNA fragment also caused a strong shift; however, the position of this band remained unchanged in the presence of preimmune serum or HuR antibody,i.e. no supershift was observed (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that the HuR protein is not involved in the major complex formed with crude extracts. Furthermore, no HuR protein was detectable in Western blots using crude extracts of PE-treated TFG2 cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that the protein induced by PE in TFG2 cells that binds to the AURE within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR is distinct from HuR. Above data showed that the AURE within p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR is responsible for PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability, and a p24/52AUBF binds, we wondered whether PE was able to stimulate this p24/52AUBF binding. TFG2 cells were treated with PE for various time periods, then the cell extracts were prepared and subjected to RMSA. As shown in Fig.5 A, PE treatment significantly stimulated the p24/52AUBF binding. This suggests that PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability is due to enhancement of binding of p24/52AUBF to the AURE within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR. Activation of p42/44 MAP kinase has been implicated in controlling p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability (28.Ravi R.K. McMahon M. Zang Y. Williams J. Dillehay L. Nelkin B. Mabry M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We wondered whether PE induction of p24/52AUBF binding is mediated by a p42/44 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. As shown in Fig. 5 B, treatment of TFG2 cells with PD98059 not only significantly attenuated basal levels of p24/52AUBFbinding (lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1) but also antagonized PE-induced p24/52AUBF binding (lane 4 versus lane 5). These findings suggest that activation of p42/44 MAP kinase is involved in PE induction of p24/52AUBF binding. To further confirm the role of p42/44 MAP kinase in PE induction of p24/52AUBF binding, TFG2 cells were infected with a dominant negative MEK1 recombinant adenovirus to block the activation of p42/44 MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 5 C, infection with MEK1 dominant negative adenovirus but not with control virus not only significantly inhibited the basal p24/52AUBF binding but also markedly attenuated PE induction of p24/52AUBFbinding, which further suggests that p42/44 MAP kinase is involved. The control of p21 waf1/cip1 gene transcription has been extensively studied, with more than 15 transcription factors that bind to the p21 waf1/cip1 gene promoter identified (reviewed in Ref. 17.Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1998; 20: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptional mechanisms have been also implicated in the regulation of p21 waf1/cip1 gene expression by a number of conditions listed in the Introduction (18.Johannessen L.E. Knardal S.L. Madshus I.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19.Esposito F. Cuccovillo F. Vanoni M. Cimino F. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Russo T. Eur. J.

Alpauh M. Fontana J. Barsky S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying such posttranscriptional regulation remain unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that PE treatment markedly enhances p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability in TFG2 cells, and an AURE located between 583 and 625 within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR is involved in this induction. We have also demonstrated that an RNA-binding protein specifically binds to this AURE and the binding is significantly induced by PE treatment, which correlates with PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability. It is generally accepted that AURE plays an important role in controlling mRNA half-life (see review in Ref. 29.Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that many AUREs can function as mRNA-destabilizing signals. For example, the c-fos mRNA AURE has been shown to be a potent destabilizing element. Deletion of this AURE significantly increased c-fos gene expression by 20-fold (30.Lee W. Lin F.C. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5521-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31.Raymond V. Atwater J.A. Verma I.M. Oncogene Res. 1989; 4: 861-865Google Scholar). Examination of sequences revealed that the AURE region located at 583–625 within p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR contains one AUUUA and two AUUUA motifs (13.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletion of this AURE did not significantly enhance the reporter CAT mRNA stability, and inserting of this AURE alone did not significantly destabilize the reporter CAT mRNA stability in TFG2 cells. The latter result is consistent with the data reported by Li et al. (21.Li X. Rishi A.K. Shao Z. Dawson M.I. Jong L. Shroot B. Richert U. Ordonez J.V. Fontana J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5055-5062PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that inserting this AURE alone did not cause a dramatic reduction in reporter luciferase activity in breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the AURE in p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR does not play a significant role in controlling the basal p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability, which may be due to weak AUBF binding to this element in the control cells detected in RNA gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 5). Interestingly, deletion of the AURE significantly abolished PE-induced stabilization of CAT mRNA, and RNA gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that PE treatment markedly enhanced the p24/52AUBF binding to this AURE. These data strongly suggest that the AURE is responsible for PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability by binding p24/52AUBF. In preliminary experiments we found that treatment of TFG2 cells with phorbol myristate acetate or retinoic acid, which are also known to increase p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability, similarly increased the binding of this RNA-binding protein, 2J. Liu, X. Shen, V.-A. Nguyen, G. Kunos, and B. Gao, unpublished data. while treatment with cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil, which are known to increase p21 waf1/cip1 protein expression by a p53-dependent mechanism, did not stimulate the AUBF binding. This suggests that the binding of p24/52AUBF to the AURE within the p21 waf1/cip1 3′-UTR may be a universal signal involved in the control of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability by many stimuli. The identity of the AUBF in the present paper is not yet clear. In the past few years, at least 10 AUBFs have been isolated. They include AUF1 (32.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2051-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and members of the Elav family (37.Antic D. Keene J.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38.Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Among them, only the Elav family of RNA-binding proteins has been well characterized (37.Antic D. Keene J.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38.Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and these proteins have been reported to bind the AURE in the p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA 3′-UTR and to enhance p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability (27.Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, three lines of evidence suggest that the p24/52AUBF reported here is not an Elav protein. First, anti-HuR antibody did not induce any supershifted bands in RNA gel mobility supershift assays (Fig. 4). Second, we were unable to detect HuR protein in TFG2 crude cell extracts in Western blots, which confirms that TFG2 cells express little if any HuR protein. Third, the molecular mass of HuR is 30 kDa, which is distinct from 24 and 52 kDa reported here. PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA is rapid, its peak occurring at 2 h (Fig. 1), and does not require new protein synthesis, which is consistent with the rapid induction of p24/52AUBF binding in RNA mobility shift assay (Fig. 5). Rapid induction of p24/52AUBF binding by PE is probably due to phosphorylation of this protein. We have earlier reported that PE induction of p21 waf1/cip1 protein expression is mediated by a p42/44 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism (7.Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and activation of p42/44 MAP kinase has been implicated in the control of p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability (28.Ravi R.K. McMahon M. Zang Y. Williams J. Dillehay L. Nelkin B. Mabry M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we provided two lines of evidence to support that PE induction of p24/52AUBF binding requires activation of p42/44 MAP kinase (Fig. 5). First, specific inhibition of MEK1 and p42/44 MAP kinase activity by PD98059 markedly inhibited both basal and PE induction of p24/52AUBF binding (Fig. 5 B). PD98059 has been reported to be specific for MEK1/2 and p42/44 MAP kinase (39.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 40.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). We have shown2 that 25–50 μm PD98059 markedly suppressed PE-activated p42/44 MAP kinase but did not suppress PE-activated p38 MAP kinase or JNK in TFG2 cells. The inhibition of p24/52AUBF binding by PD98059 is not a nonspecific or toxic effect because this drug did not affect nuclear factor 1-DNA binding.2 Second, more convincingly, infection of a dominant negative MEK1 markedly suppressed both basal and PE-induced p24/52AUBF binding. It is generally believed that p42/44 MAP kinase is the specific substrate for MEK1 (41.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that PE activation of p42/44 MAP kinase is followed by phosphorylation of the p24/52AUBF, resulting in its enhanced binding to and stabilization of the p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA. However, whether there is a direct correlation between activation of p42/44 MAP kinase, induction of p24/52AUBF binding, and p21 waf1/cip1 mRNA stability awaits further purification, cloning, and characterization of the p24/52AUBF. We thank Dr. B. Vogelstein for providing the p21 waf1/cip1 cDNA and promoter/CAT construct vectors and Dr. Henry Furneaux for providing the anti-HuR antibody and for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1992151575,"To investigate the transcriptional mechanisms of rice tungro bacilliform virus, we have systematically analyzed an activator element located immediately upstream of the TATA box in the rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter and its cognate trans-acting factors. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we showed that rice nuclear proteins bind to the activator element, forming multiple specific DNA-protein complexes via protein-protein interactions. Copper-phenanthroline footprinting and DNA methylation interference analysis indicated that multiple DNA-protein complexes share a common binding site located between positions -60 to -39, and the proteins contact the activator element in the major groove. DNA UV cross-linking assays further showed that two nuclear proteins (36 and 33 kDa), found in rice cell suspension and shoot nuclear extracts, and one (27 kDa), present in root nuclear extracts, bind to this activator element. In protoplasts derived from a rice (Oryza sativa) suspension culture, the activator element is a prerequisite for promoter activity and its function is critically dependent on its position relative to the TATA box. Thus, transcriptional activation may function via interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery, and we propose that this activation is mediated by protein-protein interactions in a position-dependent mechanism."

Res. 1994; 387: 59-71PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these nuclear receptors are known hormone receptors, whereas the vast majority of the cloned nuclear receptors remain as orphan members. Despite the lack of identified ligands, the physiological roles of several orphan receptors have begun to be revealed in genetic studies (7.Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Lee S.S. Pineau T.

The mouse orphan receptor TR2 was isolated from an E8.5 embryonic cDNA library (11.Wei L.-N. Hsu Y.-C. Dev. Growth Differ. 1994; 36: 187-196Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the gene was characterized (12.Lee C.-H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Wei L.-N. Genomics. 1995; 30: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The human TR2 was cloned from a prostate cDNA library (13.Chang C Kokontis J. Acakpo-Satchivi L. Liao S. Takeda H. Chang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Like many other orphan receptors, the biological activity of TR2 was first demonstrated in several reporter systems. For instance, TR2 repressed reporters driven by a direct repeat (DR)-4 hormone response element derived from the mouse cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I gene promoter (14.Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and a DR1-type RA response element derived from the cellular retinol-binding protein II gene promoter (15.Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, TR2 strongly suppressed RA induction of a reporter driven by the DR5 derived from RA receptor β2 (RARβ2) promoter, mediated by competitive binding of TR2 to this DR5 (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17.Lee Y.-F. Young W. Burbank J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By using this DR5 reporter as a model system, the functional characteristics of TR2 were examined, and its molecular features required for a suppressive activity were revealed. It was demonstrated that the suppressive activity required the DBD, the ability to dimerize, the LBD, and two consecutive glutamate residues at amino acid (aa) positions 553/554 (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel receptor heterodimeric pathway was identified that involved heterodimers of TR2 and TR4 (19.Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25209-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, the mouse nuclear receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) was cloned and demonstrated as a co-repressor for TR2 by interacting with its LBD (20.Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In all these functional studies, TR2 appears to affect RA signaling pathways by regulating the components for RA metabolism (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein-I and cellular retinol-binding protein-II) and modulating RA induction of target gene expression. Of most significance is the potent suppression of RA induction of DR5-type RA response element derived from the RARβ2 gene promoter. RARβ2 is known as one of the earliest RA-responding genes in several culture systems, most notably the embryonal carcinoma cell cultures such as P19 and F9 (21.de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 22.Mendelsohn C. Larkin S. Mark M. LeMeur M. Clifford J. Zelent A. Chambon P. Mech.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This gene serves as one of the master regulators in many RA-induced cellular events, such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, by regulating a number of downstream effector genes (25.Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 343-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26.Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RARβ2 gene is weakly expressed in stem cell populations and is rapidly induced by RA (27.Kruyt F.A.E. van den Brink C.E. Defize L.H.K. Donath M.J. Kastner P. Kruijer W. Chambon P. van der Saag P.T. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A functional promoter of this gene consists of several essential DNA response elements arranged in close proximity. These include, among others, an RA-responding DR5, a cyclic AMP-response element (CRE), and a TATA box (28.Kruyt F.A.E. Folkers G.E. van den Brink C.E. van der Saag P.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6393-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The DR5 is responsible for a rapid and potent RA induction, mediated by holo-RAR/RXR binding (21.de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 23.Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The biological effects of cAMP has also been confirmed in the P19 culture model (28.Kruyt F.A.E. Folkers G.E. van den Brink C.E. van der Saag P.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6393-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although RA induction appears to be the most effective trigger that induces this gene expression in the stem cell cultures, the regulation of this gene in animals appears to be rather complicated. For instance, the expression pattern of this gene in animal tissues does not always correspond to the panel of tissues that are rich in RA (22.Mendelsohn C. Larkin S. Mark M. LeMeur M. Clifford J. Zelent A. Chambon P. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30.Colbert M.C. Linney E. LaMantia A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Development. 1991; 113: 723-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Zimmer A. Zimmer A. Development. 1992; 116: 977-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this promoter cannot be activated by RA in a number of cell types such as breast tumor and lung cancer cell lines as well as some pituitary cell lines (33.Davis K.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34.Moghal N. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 133-141PubMed Google Scholar) despite the detection of a potent RA induction in these cells using reporters containing the dissected DR5 (34.Moghal N. Neel B.G. Mol.

All these observations suggest that the induction of the RARβ2 gene may involve factors other than RA. Like the studies of several other orphan receptors COUP-TF, nerve growth factor-1B, Dax1, and hepatocyte nulcear factor-4 (37.Nakshatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 372: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), previous studies of TR2 in different labs have utilized RA response element- and other hormone response element-containing reporters to examine its biological activities (5.Mangelsdorf D.J.

Graupner G. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The finding that apo-TR2 is able to bind to this DR5 with a high affinity (an estimatedK d 7.4 nm) in the absence of putative ligands (12.Lee C.-H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Wei L.-N. Genomics. 1995; 30: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13437-13443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has prompted us to examine the effect of TR2 expression on the endogenous RARβ2 gene activity in the absence of RA. In this study, it is demonstrated that apo-TR2 functions as a constitutive activator for reporters driven by the RARβ2 promoter containing the DR5 element, and overexpression of TR2 in P19 stem cells activates the endogenous RARβ2 gene expression. Furthermore, cAMP exerts an enhancing effect on the activating function of TR2 on this promoter, which contains a CRE and a DR5. The activating function of TR2 is mapped to its N-terminal segment, corresponding to the A domain, and the AB segment is involved in a direct intermolecular interaction of TR2 with an activator form of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), CREMτ (41.Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Pever P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 362: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Finally, in gel mobility shift assays, TR2 competes with P19 nuclear factors binding to the RARβ2promoter, and TR2 and CREMτ bind simultaneously to this DNA fragment. We now report these studies characterizing TR2 as a constitutive activator for the RARβ2 promoter, which can be enhanced by cAMP. The RARβ2 reporters were constructed by fusing genomic sequences generated by polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) (for CRE/DR5/TATA-luc and ∼CRE/DR5/TATA-Luc), SmaI digestion (for DR5/TATA-luc), or re-annealing of oligonucleotides (for TATA-luc) upstream to a promoterless luciferase cDNA, pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA for mouse CREMτ (42.Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) was also obtained in a reverse transcription-coupled PCR (RT-PCR) using mouse testis mRNA as the template and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNA of CREMτ was cloned into the pSG5 vector at BglII site for expression in mammalian cells and for in vitro transcription/translation reactions (for gel mobility shift assay). The expression vectors for TR2 and deletions and point mutations, cloned in pSG5 vectors, were described previously (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The dissected TR2 segments to be cloned into mammalian two-hybrid expression vectors (see “Mammalian Two-hybrid and Transactivation Assays” under “Experimental Procedures”) were obtained by either restriction digestion of TR2 cDNA or PCR. The fragment containing the AB domain and a small portion of the zinc finger (aa 1–138) was obtained as a 0.4-kilobase fragment byEcoRI/PstI digestion at the N terminus of TR2 cDNA, the A segment (aa 1–50) was obtained as a 0.15-kilobase fragment by EcoRI/BamHI digestion, and the B segment (aa 51138) was obtained by BamHI/PstI digestion in a size of 0.25 kilobases. Further deletions of the A domain (A-1/40, 1/30, 10/30, and 10/25) were obtained in PCRs. TableI summarizes the oligonucleotides used in PCRs to generate specific DNA fragments for this study.

Open table in a new tab The P19 cell line, maintained as described previously (43.Wei L.-N. Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. Nguyen-Huu M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was used to determine the effects of expressing TR2 on the endogenous RARβ2 gene activity. COS-1 cells were used in co-transfection experiments to determine the effects of added nuclear receptors on the reporter gene activity as well as mammalian two-hybrid interaction experiments as described (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20.Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All the COS-1 cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing dextran charcoal-treated serum (DCC medium). Transfection was conducted by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and LacZ and luciferase activities were determined as described (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was normalized to the LacZ activity of the internal control to obtain specific luciferase unit. To compare the relative activity of different expression vectors on the reporter, the specific luciferase unit of the control vector was assigned an arbitrary value of 1 in order to determine the relative luciferase unit of each expression vector, which represented the relative activity of the expression vector. Triplicate cultures were used in each transfection experiment, and three independent experiments were conducted to obtain the means and S.E. for all the transfection experiments. RT-PCR was conducted to detect the expression of endogenous gene expression in P19 cultures. Primers for RARβ2 are 5′-TGGACTTTTCTGTGCGGC-3′ (nucleotide position 391–408 in Fig. 2 of Ref. 24.Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A. Garnier J.M. Ruffenach F. Leory P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), where the 5′-untranslated region of RARβ2 is located, and 5′-GGGAATGTCTGCAACAGCTGGA-3′ from the 3′-untranslated region (24.Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A. Garnier J.M. Ruffenach F. Leory P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A fragment of approximately 1.6 kilobases of RARβ2 was amplified by using this pair of primers. P19 cells seeded at a density of 5 × 105/10-cm plate were used for each treatment. Cells from one 10-cm plate were harvested for RNA isolation and resuspended in a final volume of 20 μl. Two μl total RNA prepared from each P19 culture was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) as the primer in a total volume of 20 μl. Two μl of each RT reaction was used in PCR in a total volume of 25 μl and primed with two sets of oligos, one specific to actin (11.Wei L.-N. Hsu Y.-C. Dev. Growth Differ. 1994; 36: 187-196Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the second specific to RARβ2. The PCR reaction cycle was 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, for a total of 30 cycles. Five μl of each PCR product was analyzed on Southern blots and probed with actin- and RARβ2-specific probes. For the mammalian two-hybrid interaction assay, pM (containing the DBD of GAL4) and pVP (containing the activation domain of VP16) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used to construct the expression vectors. Pairs of pM and pVP fusions were tested in parallel. To examine intermolecular interactions, the cDNA for CREMτ was cloned into pM and tested against TR2 fragments cloned in pVP. The reporter construct for the mammalian two-hybrid interaction as well as transfection procedures were as described previously (20.Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To detect the intrinsic transactivator function of TR2, various TR2 segments were fused to pM vector. A GAL4 binding site-driven luciferase reporter and the internal control lacZ were as described (20.Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Activation of reporter by GAL4 fusions was determined by comparing their specific luciferase units to that of the control. The anti-TR2 antibody generated previously (12.Lee C.-H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Wei L.-N. Genomics. 1995; 30: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17.Lee Y.-F. Young W. Burbank J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13437-13443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was not effective for immunoprecipitation; therefore, we utilized a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TR2 expression vector (20.Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) in immunoprecipitation experiments. The biological activity (suppression of RA induction on the DR5-containing reporter) and biochemical property (binding to DR5 element) of HA-TR2 expressed from this vector were demonstrated previously (20.Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The activation function of HA-TR2 on RARβ2 promoter was confirmed in this study (see “Results”). This vector was used to transfect COS-1 cells in co-immunoprecipitation experiments involving TR2. COS-1 cells were transfected with the HA-TR2 in the presence or absence of the CREMτ expression vector. Cells from one 10-cm plate for each treatment were harvested at 36–48 h and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture). For immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of the cell lysate was incubated with a mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 ° C for 2 h, followed by the addition of 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose CL4B resin (Sigma). The precipitation was conducted overnight at 4 °C, and the resin was vigorously washed three times with the lysis buffer and resuspended in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer for Western blot analysis. A 10% polyacrylamide gel was used for protein separation, and the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blot was incubated with a rabbit anti-CREM antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight, followed by washing and reaction with a mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody and detection with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To monitor TR2 precipitated in the reactions, the signals on the blot were stripped off by washing in a solution of 2% SDS, 100 mm 2β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7 at 50 °C for 30 min. The blot was then reacted with the rabbit anti-TR2 antibody (12.Lee C.-H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Wei L.-N.

Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract of P19 was isolated as described (44.Zhang X. Huang C.J. Nazarian R. Ritchie T. de Vellis J.S. Nobel E.P. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 849-850Google Scholar). The extract from a 10-cm dish was resuspended in a volume of 60 μl, and 4 μl (about 10 μg of nuclear protein) was used in each gel shift reaction. Protein was also prepared using in vitro transcription and translation reactions (TNT, Promega). For protein-DNA interactions, the in vitro translated protein or nuclear extract isolated from P19 cells was incubated with 1 ng of probe in a 20 μl of binding buffer. The probes were prepared by labeling the double-stranded DNA fragments isolated from the genomic segments described in a previous section (CRE/DR5/TATA and DR5/TATA) with [32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. A fragment containing only the DR5 (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol.

Previously, the biological activity of orphan receptor TR2 was demonstrated to be primarily suppressive on both RA induction of DR5-containing reporters (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the suppressive activity required the intact LBD and DBD but not the N-terminal A/B domains of the molecule (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the suppressive effects of TR2 on RA induction of DR5-driven reporter was attributed to its competitive binding to DR5 (16.Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18.Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine the constitutive activity of TR2 on DR5 reporters, i.e. its biological activity in the absence of RA, we set up experiments to examine the effects of TR2 expression on RARβ2 gene activities using both reporter and endogenous gene expression systems. To examine the effects of TR2 expression on the endogenous RARβ2 gene expression, we used P19 stem cells, which expressed a negligible level of TR2 and RARβ2 (18.Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as an experimental system. P19 cells maintained in medium containing charcoal-treated serum were induced with RA or transfected with the wild type TR2 expression vector. RNA was isolated 12 or 24 h after the addition of RA or transfection. To detect RARβ2mRNA specifically, RT-PCR was conducted to examine its mRNA level. As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of RARβ2 (top panel) increases as compared with actin (lower panel) in cells either transfected with"

CRP serves as a transcriptional activator at numerous promoters and also can serve as a transcriptional co-activator, repressor, or co-repressor (reviewed in Ref. 1.Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). CRP binds to a 22-bp 2-fold-symmetric DNA site located in or near each CRP-regulated promoter. CRP is a dimer of two identical subunits, each consisting of 209 amino acids. The crystallographic structure of the CRP-DNA complex shows that one subunit of CRP interacts with one half of the DNA site, and the other subunit of CRP interacts with the other half of the DNA site, in an approximately 2-fold-symmetric fashion (2.Parkinson G. Wilson C. Gunasekera A. Ebright Y. Ebright R. Berman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 3.Schultz S. Shields G. Steitz T. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Activation of transcription at simple CRP-dependent promoters (i.e. promoters that require only CRP for activation) involves direct protein-protein contact between CRP and RNA polymerase (RNAP). At promoters that have a DNA site for CRP located upstream of the DNA site for RNAP (class I CRP-dependent promoters), a determinant consisting of amino acids 156–164 of CRP (“activating region 1” (AR1)) makes direct contact with the RNAP α-subunit C-terminal domain (αCTD) (1.Busby S.

At CRP-dependent promoters that have the DNA site for CRP centered near position −42 (class II CRP-dependent promoters), AR1 interacts with the αCTD, and a second determinant, consisting of amino acids 19, 21, and 101 of CRP (“activating region 2” (AR2)), interacts with the RNAP α-subunit N-terminal domain (αNTD) (1.Busby S.

Pedersen H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At these promoters, CRP interacts alternatively, and mutually exclusively, with RNAP or with CytR (12.Møllegaard N. Rasmussen P. Valentin-Hansen P. Nielsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17471-17477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions in which CytR is inactive (in the presence of cytidine), CRP interacts with RNAP to form transcriptionally active CRP-RNAP-promoter complexes, making the same interactions as at the above-described class I and class II CRP-dependent promoters. Under conditions in which CytR is active (in the absence of cytidine), CRP interacts with CytR to form transcriptionally inactive CRP-CytR-promoter complexes. The simplest promoter of the CytR regulon (cytRP) contains a DNA site for CRP centered at position −63.5 and a DNA site for CytR centered at position −41.5; this promoter forms 1:1:1 CRP-CytR-promoter complexes (13.Thomsen L.

Bremer E. Valentin-Hansen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Most promoters of the CytR regulon contain two DNA sites for CRP (typically centered at or near positions −93.5 and −41.5) that flank the DNA site for CytR (e.g. deoP2, cdd-P, udp-P, and nupG-P); these promoters form 2:1:1 (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complexes, with one CytR dimer sandwiched between two CRP dimers (11.Valentin-Hansen P.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Formation of CRP-CytR-promoter and (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complexes involves both CRP-CytR and CytR-DNA interactions (16.Søgaard-Andersen L. Mironov A. Pedersen H. Sukhodelets V. Valentin-Hansen P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CRP-CytR interaction involves a determinant consisting of residues 12, 13, 17, 105, 108, and 110 of CRP (the “repression region” (RR); a determinant that is immediately adjacent to AR2 of CRP) and a chemically complementary determinant within the C-terminal domain of CytR (16.Søgaard-Andersen L.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CytR-DNA interactions involve a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif within the N-terminal domain of CytR (21.Valentin-Hansen P. Larsen J. Højrup P. Short S. Barbier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22.Weickert M. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CytR-DNA interactions are essential for complex formation at physiological levels of CytR but are not essential at high levels of CytR. Thus, CytRΔ9–49, a CytR derivative completely defective in CytR-DNA interaction, can form transcriptionally inactive (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complexes at the deoP2promoter when overproduced in vivo (23.Søgaard-Andersen L. Valentin-Hansen P. Cell. 1993; 75: 557-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which formation of CRP-CytR-promoter and (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complexes results in transcriptional repression remains to be established. Three (not mutually exclusive) models seem possible. (i) CytR may interfere with interaction between AR1 of CRP and αCTD of RNAP (by occupying the DNA segment adjacent to CRP, preventing access of αCTD to this DNA segment). (ii) CytR may interfere with interaction between AR2 of CRP and αNTD of RNAP (by interacting with a determinant on CRP immediately adjacent to AR2, preventing access of αNTD to AR2). (iii) CytR may interfere with interaction between RNAP and the core promoter. As a first step to distinguish among these models, we have used oriented heterodimer analysis (9.Zhou Y. Busby S. Ebright R. Cell. 1993; 73: 375-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to determine which subunit of the CRP dimer functionally interacts with CytR in CRP-CytR-mediated transcriptional repression and to relate the identity of this subunit to the identities of the subunits that functionally present AR1 and AR2 in CRP-mediated transcriptional activation.

To analyze CRP-CytR-promoter complex formation, we constructed a set of three promoter derivatives, starting from the well characterized class II CRP-dependent promoter CC(−41.5) (1.Busby S.

Each of the three promoter derivatives has a DNA site for CRP centered at position −41.5 and a consensus DNA site for CytR (29.Kristensen H.-H. Valentin-Hansen P. Søgaard-Andersen L. J. Mol.

To analyze (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complex formation, we constructed an analogous set of three promoter derivatives, each having DNA sites for CRP centered at positions −94.5 and −41.5 and a consensus DNA site for CytR (29.Kristensen H.-H.

Analysis of promoter activities in vivo confirms that the two sets of promoter derivatives exhibit the expected patterns of regulation by CRP, [Ala13]CRP (a CRP derivative specifically defective in CRP-CytR interaction; Ref. 19.Meibom K.

To determine which subunit of the CRP dimer functionally interacts with CytR in CRP-CytR-promoter complex formation (i.e. to determine which subunit of the CRP dimer functionally presents the RR) we performed oriented heterodimer analysis using promoter derivatives O-XC and O-CX (Fig. 2). We constructed and analyzed CRP heterodimers having one subunit with a functional RR and relaxed DNA-binding specificity and one subunit with a nonfunctional RR and wild-type DNA-binding specificity. For the subunit with a functional RR and relaxed DNA binding specificity, we used the [Val181]CRP subunit, which has a substitution within the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif of CRP that permits efficient recognition of both the consensus DNA half-sites (C in O-XC and O-CX) and of DNA half-sites with the nonconsensus base pair A:T at position 7 (X in O-XC and O-CX) (7.Niu W.

For the subunit with a nonfunctional RR and wild-type DNA binding specificity, we used the [Ala13]CRP subunit (Table III; Ref. 19.Meibom K. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mironov A. Valentin-Hansen P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Such heterodimers bind to the DNA sites for CRP in O-XC and O-CX in defined, predictable orientations (7.Niu W. Kim Y. Tau G.

The results of in vitro transcription experiments with the oriented heterodimers are presented in Fig. 2 b. The [Val181]CRP/[Ala13]CRP heterodimer was functional in CRP-CytR-mediated transcriptional repression at O-XC (with the functional RR in the CytR-proximal subunit) but was not functional in CRP-CytR-mediated transcriptional repression at O-CX (with the nonfunctional RR in the CytR-proximal subunit). In contrast, the [Val181]CRP/CRP heterodimer, which served as a control with a functional RR in each subunit, was functional in CRP-CytR-mediated transcriptional repression at both O-XC and O-CX (as also was the control [Val181]CRP/[Val181]CRP homodimer, which served as a further control with a functional RR in each subunit; data not shown). We conclude that the CytR-proximal subunit of CRP functionally presents RR in CRP-CytR-promoter complex formation. To determine which CRP subunits functionally interact with CytR in (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complex formation, we performed analogous oriented heterodimer experiments using promoter derivatives CX-O-XC and XC-O-CX (Fig. 3). Because CytRΔ9–49 is more defective in [Ala13]CRP-mediated transcriptional repression of CC-O-CC compared with wild-type CytR (Table III), we used CytRΔ9–49 in the oriented heterodimer experiments at CX-O-XC and XC-O-CX. The results of in vitro transcription experiments are presented in Fig. 3 b, and the results of in vivoexperiments are presented in Fig. 3 c. Both in vitro and in vivo, the [Val181]CRP/[Ala13]CRP heterodimer was functional in (CRP)2-CytR-mediated transcriptional repression at CX-O-XC (with a functional RR in the CytR-proximal subunit of each CRP dimer) but was not functional in (CRP)2-CytR-mediated transcriptional repression at XC-O-CX (with a nonfunctional RR in the CytR-proximal subunit of each CRP dimer). In contrast, the control [Val181]CRP/CRP heterodimer was functional in (CRP)2-CytR-mediated repression at both CX-O-XC and XC-O-CX (as was also the control [Val181]CRP/[Val181]CRP homodimer; data not shown). We conclude that the CytR-proximal subunit of each CRP dimer functionally presents RR in (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complex formation. Our results establish that only one subunit of CRP, the CytR-proximal subunit, functionally interacts with CytR in CRP-CytR-promoter complex formation at the O-CC promoter (Fig. 2). Our results further establish that only one subunit of each CRP dimer, the CytR-proximal subunit of each CRP dimer, functionally interacts with CytR in (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complex formation at the CC-O-CC promoter (Fig. 3). Our results support the schematic models in Fig.4 and structural models in Fig.5.Figure 5Models for the structures of the CRP-CytR-promoter complex (a) and the ( CRP )2-CytR-promoter complex (b).

At such a promoter, CRP activates transcription through two sets of interactions: (i) protein-protein interaction between AR1 of the upstream subunit of the CRP dimer and RNAP αCTD, which interacts with the DNA segment immediately upstream of the CRP dimer and (ii) protein-protein interaction between AR2 of the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer and RNAP αNTD (Fig. 4 a; Refs. 1.Busby S.

Our results indicate that, at such a promoter, CytR interacts with the subunit of CRP that functionally presents AR1 but does not interact with the subunit of CRP that functionally presents AR2 (compare locations ofblue, red, and yellow determinants in Figs. 4, a and b, and 5 a). In the absence of CytR, the CC-O-CC promoter is a compound class I/class II CRP-dependent promoter (Fig. 4 c). At such a promoter, CRP activates transcription through three sets of interactions: (i) protein-protein interaction between AR1 of the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer in the −94 region and one copy of RNAP αCTD, which interacts with the DNA segment immediately downstream of this CRP dimer; (ii) protein-protein interaction between AR1 of the upstream subunit of the CRP dimer in the −42 region and the other copy of RNAP αCTD, which interacts with the DNA segment immediately upstream of this CRP dimer; and (iii) protein-protein interaction between AR2 of the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer in the −42 region and RNAP αNTD (1.Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that, at such a promoter, CytR interacts with the subunit of CRP that functionally presents AR1 in each CRP dimer but does not interact with the subunit of CRP that functionally presents AR2 (compare locations ofblue, red, and yellow determinants in Figs. 4, c and d, and 5 b). Our results indicate that, at both O-CC and CC-O-CC, CytR interacts with the CRP subunit that functionally presents AR1 (Figs. 4, b andd, and 5). Molecular modeling indicates that interaction between CytR and the CRP subunit that functionally presents AR1 is likely to interfere with interaction between AR1 and RNAP αCTD, both by obstructing access to AR1 and by obstructing access to the DNA segment adjacent to AR1 (Fig. 5). We propose that CytR inhibits transcription, at least in part, by interfering with interaction between AR1 and RNAP αCTD. In contrast, our results indicate that CytR does not interact with the CRP subunit that functionally presents AR2 (Figs. 4, b andd, and 5). We propose that CytR does not inhibit transcription by interfering with interactions between AR2 and RNAP αNTD. Our results provide new information about the architecture of CRP-CytR-promoter and (CRP)2-CytR-promoter complexes and constrain possible mechanisms for transcription repression by CytR. Important objectives for further work include determination of the subunit of CytR that functionally interacts with CRP and determination whether repression by CytR is solely due to interference with interaction between CRP and RNAP (“anti-activation”) or also involves interference, directly or indirectly, with interactions between RNAP and the core promoter (“direct repression”).

In Xenopus laevis oocytes the VSG lipase was expressed as a nonacylated and a thioacylated form. This thioacylation occurred within a cluster of three cysteine residues but was not essential for catalytic activity per se. These two forms were also detected in trypanosomes and appeared to be present at roughly equivalent amounts. A reversible shift to the acylated form occurred when cells were triggered to release the VSG by either nonlytic acid stress or osmotic lysis. A wild type VSG lipase or a gene mutated in the three codons for the acylated cysteines were reinserted in the genome of a trypanosome null mutant for this gene.

Chem. 1986; 261: 15767-15771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that is encoded by a single copy gene that is only expressed in bloodstream forms of the parasite (9.Carrington M. Bülow R. Reinke H. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10.Mensa-Wilmot K. Hereld D. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This lipase possesses several rather curious features that deserve further comment. First, VSG lipase behaves as an integral membrane protein during purification and subcellular fractionation (6.Bülow R. Overath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11918-11923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1992; 56: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), even though the primary sequence does not contain any obvious hydrophobic stretches to account for this physical property. Second, the apparent subcellular localization of the protein to the cytoplasmic face of small intracellular vesicles (12.Bülow R. Griffiths G. Webster P. Stierhof Y.-D. Opperdoes F. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 233-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) presents a topological problem: how does the enzyme gain access to the GPI substrate of the VSG, which is thought to be present on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane? Third, despite considerable effort the physiological role of the VSG lipase remains elusive (13.Carrington M. Walters D. Webb H. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At present there is a consensus that this enzyme is not obligatorily required during any stage of the life cycle principally because null mutants that lack the gene were capable of cyclical transmission between host and vector (14.Webb H. Carnall N. Vanhamme L. Rolin S. Van Den Abbeele J. Welburn S. Pays E. Carrington M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these null mutants consistently exhibited lower parasitaemias in mice (14.Webb H. Carnall N. Vanhamme L. Rolin S. Van Den Abbeele J. Welburn S. Pays E. Carrington M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and appear to be compromised in their ability to undergo stress-induced differentiation from the bloodstream to the insect stage of procyclic form in vitro (15.Rolin S. Hanocq-Quertier J. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Nolan D.P. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). If the biological function of the VSG lipase in T. bruceiremains equivocal, what is certain is that this enzyme must be regulated, at least in terms of VSG release. This view is predicated on the relative abundance of VSG lipase in bloodstream trypomastigotes, approximately 3 × 104 molecules/cell, which allied to an estimated turnover rate of 100–700 mfVSG molecules/min is more than sufficient to release the entire VSG coat (107molecules/cell) within a few minutes (7.Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13813-13818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Carrington M. Carnall N. Crow M.S. Gaud A. Redpath M.B. Wasunna C.L. Webb H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 91: 153-164Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, large scale release of VSG does not occur under physiological conditions (4.Rolin S. Hanocq-Quertier J. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Nolan D.P. Salmon D. Webb H. Carrington M. Voorheis P. Pays E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10844-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the focus of this study was to identify possible regulatory features responsible for this behavior. Heterologous expression of the VSG lipase mRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed equivalent expression of two forms of the enzyme: a nonmodified form as well as a form post-translationally acylated on two or three clustered cysteine residues. Similar results were obtained with T. brucei. Although this thioacylation was not absolutely essential for the enzymatic activity, the data supported the view that acylation may be involved in regulating access to the VSG substrate. During the course of this work another group also reported that the VSG lipase was modified by S-myristoylation (17.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although our results are similar in some respects to those reported in this study, we report additional data concerning the site of acylation and also present evidence that reversible thioacylation might modulate access of the enzyme to the GPI anchor of the VSG in trypanosomes. T. brucei AnTat 1.1A and 1.3A clones from the EATRO1125 stock were grown in mice and purified by the method of Lanham (18.Lanham S.M. Nature. 1968; 218: 1273-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) with certain modifications, e.g.supplementing the isolation buffer with sucrose (80 mm), KCl (5 mm), and adenosine (0.2 mm), designed to avoid nonphysiological conditions during the isolation step that have been shown to cause biochemical changes in the parasite (19.Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Grab D.J. J. Protozol. 1987; 34: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Procyclic forms used for transfection were from the null VSG lipase mutant (14.Webb H. Carnall N. Vanhamme L. Rolin S. Van Den Abbeele J. Welburn S. Pays E. Carrington M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cultivation, electroporation, and fly transmission of these transformants were performed according to Ref. 20.Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Zitzmann N. Hanocq-Quertier J. Vanhamme L. Rolin S. Geuskens M. Ferguson M. Pays E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, except that selection was made with 2 μg/ml phleomycin. The bloodstream form transformants were analyzed after passaging in immunosupressed mice. Oocyte dissection, maintenance, and microinjection were performed as described elsewhere (21.Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Nolan D. Ruben L. Pays E. Cell. 1994; 78: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In all experiments, 30 ng of VSG lipase mRNA were injected in a volume of 15 nl. The VSG lipase transcription vector was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and subcloning of the T. brucei GPI-PLC cDNA (9.Carrington M. Bülow R. Reinke H. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in pCR2.1 (InVitrogen). The polymerase chain reaction product was released byAsp718I digestion and ligated in the same site in the pBSDH1400H-A65 transcription vector (22.Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This construct was mutagenized using in some cases the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit and in other cases the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, both from Stratagene. Cysteines 24, 80, 184, 269, 270, 273, 332, and 347 of the VSG lipase were individually substituted with serine, isoleucine, serine, leucine, alanine, arginine, serine, and serine, respectively. In the double cysteine (269 + 270) and triple cysteine (269 + 270 + 273) mutants, cysteines were replaced by serine + arginine and serine + arginine + arginine, respectively. A triple substitution by serine gave rise to unstable protein (data not shown). To insert the VSG lipase (wild type or mutant) in the pPT vector (23.Jefferies D. Tebabi P. Le Ray D. Pays E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we took advantage of the pPT construct containing the AnTat 11.17 VSG cDNA sequence flanked with SacI and XbaI sites at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. The wild type and the triple mutant version of the VSG lipase were removed from the pBSDH1400H-A65 constructs by SacI + XbaI digestion and ligated with the SacI/XbaI-cleaved pPT11.17 vector. The final pPT constructs were targeted to the tubulin locus of procyclic forms of the null VSG lipase mutant by linearization withSpeI and electroporation. Anti-VSG lipase antibodies were generated in rabbits by immunization with a purified C-terminal His-tagged VSG lipase expressed in Escherichia coli (24.Carnall N. Webb H. Carrington M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The anti-CRD antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. Paul Englund (Baltimore, MD) and purified according to Ref. 3.Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Turner M.J. Nature. 1983; 302: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar. The anti-AnTat 1.1 antibodies were a hyperimmune serum from the Institute for Tropical Medicine (Antwerp, Belgium). Electrophoresis was conducted in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli except that the protein samples were usually incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the loading buffer instead of being boiled (25.Mc Ihlinney R.A.J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1992: 15-36Google Scholar). However, immunoprecipitates were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C to elute proteins bound to the protein A-Sepharose. Electrophoresis was followed by either fluorography (26.Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar) or Western blotting (27.Paindavoine P. Rolin S. Van Assel S. Geuskens G. Jauniaux J.C. Dinsart C. Huet G. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Visualization was performed with either anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase or with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fluorography was used for 35S detection in both Xenopus and trypanosome extracts, as well as for 3H-labeled oocyte samples. Analysis of [3H]palmitic acid incorporation in trypanosome extracts was performed after blotting of the gels onto nitrocellulose. TheEcoRV-linearized transcription vectors were used as templates for mRNA synthesis, and the mRNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described (21.Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Nolan D. Ruben L. Pays E. Cell. 1994; 78: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The fate of the [35S]methionine-labeled VSG lipase in the oocyte was followed after submitting the reticulocyte reaction mixture to a spun Biogel P-6 DG (Bio-Rad) column (500 μl of packed resin) to eliminate the unincorporated radiolabeled methionine. Iodoacetamide treatment of radiolabeled reticulocyte mixture was performed by adding 15volumes of 0.25 m iodoacetamide in 0.25 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0) to one-half of the sample, whereas the second half received only the buffer. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, Biogel P-6 DG filtration was performed for both samples as described above. After overnight incubation at 18 °C in saline medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml gentamycin (21.Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Nolan D. Ruben L. Pays E. Cell. 1994; 78: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the injected oocytes were carefully inspected before being incubated for another 20–24 h in the same medium containing 1 mCi/mll-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a ratio of 300 μl for 50 oocytes. Fatty acid labeling was performed by firstly evaporating either [9,10(n)-3H]palmitic acid or myristic acid (530 Ci/mm in both cases) and then coupling them onto defatted bovine serum albumin to reach the concentration of 200 μCi/ml in the final 300-μl incubation volume. Metabolic labeling was then performed as described elsewhere (28.Field M.C. Menon A.K. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1992: 155-190Google Scholar). Total oocyte extracts were prepared by a first extensive washing of the labeled oocytes, followed by homogenization at 0 °C in a volume of 20 μl/oocyte of NaCl (150 mm), n-OG (1.5%, w/v), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl-fluoride (50 μm), trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (10 μm), pepstatine (1 μm), EDTA (1 mm), and Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5). After centrifugation for 15 min at 500 × g to pellet the yolk platelets, the supernatants were aliquoted and kept at −70 °C. In all experiments, 10 μl of extract, equivalent to half an oocyte, was loaded per lane. Partition of the VSG lipase by phase separation in Triton X-114 was performed by washing and homogenization at 0 °C of 20 oocytes in 1.1 ml of NaCl (150 mm), Triton X-100 (0.05%, w/v), and Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5) supplemented with the same mixture of protease inhibitors as above. After centrifugation for 15 min at 500 × g, 100 μl of precondensed Triton X-114 (12%, w/v) were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated at 0 °C for about 30 min. The supernatant of the next 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g was submitted to phase separation (29.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aqueous and detergent phases were each re-extracted once. Both types of samples were precipitated for 30 min at −20 °C with 5 volumes of ice-cold acetone, in the presence of 100 μg of RNase as a carrier for the detergent extract only. The dried acetonic powders were dissolved in Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE. AnTat 1.1 mf-VSG was prepared by homogeneizing bloodstream forms (AnTat 1.1; 108 cells) in 500 μl of NaCl (150 mm), Triton X-100 (0.05%), and Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5) together with the usual mixture of protease inhibitors and p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonic acid (10 mm) to inactivate the endogenous VSG lipase. After addition of 112 volume of precondensed Triton X-114, phase partitioning was performed (29.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detergent phase was re-extracted once and then frozen in aliquots. AnTat 1.1 mfVSG was added to Triton X-114 extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled oocytes, injected or not with the VSG lipase mRNA. Both were diluted 30 times in the Tris-NaCl-Triton X-100 buffer to decrease the Triton X-114 concentration to a maximum of 0.05%. In all assays, the mf-VSG was mixed with the Triton phase from four oocytes, and the incubation was performed in a final volume of 550 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. After addition of 50 μl of Triton X-114, the reaction mixture was submitted to phase separation again. Both phases were re-extracted once, electrophoresed, and blotted. The presence of the VSG lipase was monitored by the 35S labeling, whereas the VSG was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-AnTat 1.1 antibodies (100,000-fold dilution). Trypanosomes (2 × 107cells/ml) were incubated in cysteine/methionine-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 30 mmHepes (pH 7.4), catalase (5 μg/ml), adenosine (0.4 mm) and phosphate-buffered saline-dialyzed fetal calf serum (10%, v/v) containing [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PRO-MIXTM) as described previously (30.Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling with 3H-labeled fatty acids (200 μCi/ml) was performed as described by Field et al. (31.Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8392-8400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypanosomes were resuspended at a final concentration of 109 cells/ml in NaCl (137 mm), KCl (2.7 mm), glucose (5 mm), Na2HPO4 (8 mm), and KH2PO4 (1.5 mm) final pH 7.5, and then an equal volume of phosphate buffer containing 4% SDS (w/v) was added followed by immediate incubation of the cell lysates at 100 °C for 3 min. The boiled extracts were diluted by the addition of 4 volumes of phosphate buffer containing Triton X-100 (2.5%, w/v), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), EDTA (1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), and then they were placed on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 9000 × gfor 5 min. Either 100-μl aliquots of the supernatants, which corresponded to the detergent extracts from 107trypanosomes, or oocyte samples (10 μl of n-OG extract, corresponding to half an oocyte) were mixed with varying amounts of anti-VSG lipase antibodies, ranging from 10 to 90 μl. The samples were adjusted to a constant volume of 500 μl and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle inversion. To each sample was added 3 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously swollen and washed two times in Tris-Triton buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The mixtures were submitted to a 2-h incubation at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s. The resin-bound complexes were washed once in the Tris-Triton buffer, once in the same buffer containing NaCl (500 mm), and, finally, once in the buffer without Triton. The immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All treatments were performed on the n-OG oocyte extracts essentially as described elsewhere (25.Mc Ihlinney R.A.J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1992: 15-36Google Scholar, 32.Bizzozero O.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After treatment the proteins were precipitated in acetone in the presence of 10 μg of RNase. The alkaline methanol treatment was performed in 0.1m KOH in anhydrous methanol (obtained by adsorption of methanol on a 0.3-nm molecular sieve from Merck) on acetone-precipitated samples. The control treatment consisted of neutral methanol. Both samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Hydroxylamine treatments were performed by adding to one volume of sample 10 volumes of 1 m hydroxylamine brought to pH 7.0, 9.0, and 11.0 with NaOH. Controls were respectively 1 mTris solutions at the same pHs, and samples were incubated for 4 h at room temperature. Dithiothreitol treatment was performed by incubating each sample with 1.4 volumes of 2.5 mdithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature. Translation of the VSG lipase mRNA in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine produced a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1) that was able to convert mfVSG to sVSG in vitro (data not shown). However, injection of the same mRNA into X. laevis oocytes resulted in the roughly equivalent expression of two polypeptides: one with a size similar to the in vitro translation product (∼42 kDa) and an additional protein with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 3). Both proteins were recognized by anti-VSG lipase antibodies (see below). These polypeptides were termed forms 1 (42 kDa) and 2 (39 kDa). In partition experiments using Triton X-114 (26.Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), both forms were recovered in the detergent phase (Fig. 1, lanes 4–7). It was noted that the relative degree of separation of the two bands on SDS-PAGE gels varied to some extent depending on the precise experimental conditions and choice of detergent employed,e.g. n-OG or Triton. The activity of the enzyme expressed inXenopus oocytes was assayed by mixing mfVSG with the detergent phase from either control or VSG lipase mRNA-injected oocytes. The sVSG was detected, in the aqueous phase, only using extracts from oocytes injected with the VSG lipase mRNA (Fig. 1,lanes 8–11). The presence of an additional band with a higher electrophoretic mobility was consistent with acylation of the VSG lipase. Therefore, the oocyte extracts were subjected to treatments known to affect different covalent linkages of fatty acids to polypeptides (32.Bizzozero O.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). First, treatment with alkaline but not neutral methanol resulted in the selective loss of form 2 (39-kDa form; Fig. 2 A,arrow). Ester but not amide linkages are cleaved under these conditions that eliminated the involvement of relatively stable amide linkages such as those that occur between myristic acid and N-terminal glycine residues. Second, form 2 disappeared progressively in the presence of hydroxylamine as the H+ concentration was decreased, an effect that was not due to the concentration of H+ (Fig. 2 B). This behavior was consistent with the presence of a thioester rather than oxyester linkage of fatty acid. Finally, treatment with high concentrations of the reducing agent dithiothreitol, which affects thio- but not oxyesters, also resulted in the loss of form 2 (Fig. 2 C). The effects of these chemical treatments supported the view that the 39-kDa band represented a form of VSG lipase that was covalently modified by thioacylation. In eukaryotic cells the principal pathways for protein acylation involve attachment of myristic acid or palmitic acid and differ by the timing of the modification. Myristic acid is generally added co-translationally, whereas palmitoylation usually occurs post-translationally and is reversible. To determine when the modification of the VSG lipase occurred, the protein was first translated in vitro in the presence of35S-labeled methionine, separated from the unincorporated methionine, and then injected into oocytes. Approximately 4 h after injection form 2 (39 kDa) began to appear at the expense of form 1, and 15 h after injection both forms were present in approximately equal amounts (Fig.3 A) as observed in oocytes injected with VSG lipase mRNA (Fig. 1). As expected, form 2 was lost after alkaline methanol treatment (Fig. 3 B). Finally, if prior to the injection into the oocyte, the in vitrotranslated protein was first treated with iodoacetamide, an alkylating reagent that blocks thiol groups, form 2 was not detected (Fig.3 C). Taken together, these results supported the view that the appearance of a faster migrating species, form 2, was not due to nonspecific degradation of the injected polypeptide but reflected post-translational thioacylation of the VSG lipase. Although the kinetic data (Fig. 3 A) suggested that thioacylation of the injected protein occurred rather slowly, whether or not this was a genuine feature of the thioacylation pathway in oocytes or a secondary effect because of problems in processing the injected polypeptide remains uncertain. Direct evidence for acylation of VSG lipase was obtained by metabolically labeling oocytes injected with VSG lipase mRNA with3H-labeled palmitic or myristic acid (Fig.4 A). Both fatty acids were incorporated but only into form 2, and overall the incorporation of palmitic acid was far higher than myristic acid (compare lanes 2 and 4). In both cases the acylated form co-migrated with the 39-kDa form observed in [35S]methionine metabolic labeling experiments (lane 1), and the label was lost when the extracts were treated with alkaline methanol (Fig.4 B) or hydroxylamine (Fig. 4 C). To identify the site of thioacylation each of the 8 cysteines present in the VSG lipase were individually mutagenized (Scheme FS1). Mutations at c1, c2, c3, c7, and c8 did not lead to loss of the doublet pattern when expressed in oocytes, but each of the mutations in the clustered cysteines 4, 5, and 6 (residues 269, 270, and 273) converted the enzyme to a single form (Fig. 5 A). In all cases the protein was recovered in the detergent phase. Because each of the c4, c5, and c6 mutants were labeled by [3H]palmitic acid, albeit to a lesser than in the other mutants (Fig. 5 B), double and triple mutants of these cysteines were generated. The double c4 + c5 mutant showed only a very faint labeling, whereas the triple c4 + c5 + c6 mutant was no longer labeled (Fig. 5 B). These data suggested that in the oocytes, about half the VSG lipase molecules were acylated on at least two of the three cysteines 269, 270, and 273. Significantly, the triple c4/c5/c6 mutant was active because mfVSG was converted to sVSG, which was recovered in the aqueous phase, when mfVSG was incubated with extracts of oocytes that expressed the triple mutant form of the enzyme (Fig. 5 C). These data indicated that neither these cysteines nor their acylation were essential for lipase activity when mfVSG was the substrate, which was in agreement with the results from detailed studies on the enzyme expressed in E. coli (24.Carnall N. Webb H. Carrington M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These data also implied that the presence of an acyl chain was not solely responsible for the hydrophobic properties of the protein because the nonacylated mutant enzyme still partitioned into the Triton X-114 detergent phase (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Characterization of the cysteine mutants of the VSG lipase. The codons for each of the 8 cysteines of the VSG lipase mRNA were individually mutagenized (c1–c8, from the N to the C terminus as detaile"
