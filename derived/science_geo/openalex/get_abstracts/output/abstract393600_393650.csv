We show that layered compounds such as MoS(2), WS(2), MoSe(2), MoTe(2), TaSe(2), NbSe(2), NiTe(2), BN, and Bi(2)Te(3) can be efficiently dispersed in common solvents and can be deposited as individual flakes or formed into films. Electron microscopy strongly suggests that the material is exfoliated into individual layers. By blending this material with suspensions of other nanomaterials or polymer solutions, we can prepare hybrid dispersions or composites, which can be cast into films. We show that WS(2) and MoS(2) effectively reinforce polymers, whereas WS(2)/carbon nanotube hybrid films have high conductivity, leading to promising thermoelectric properties."
https://openalex.org/W2019229253,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer immense potential for regenerative medicine and studies of disease and development. Somatic cell reprogramming involves epigenomic reconfiguration, conferring iPSCs with characteristics similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, it remains unknown how complete the reestablishment of ES-cell-like DNA methylation patterns is throughout the genome. Here we report the first whole-genome profiles of DNA methylation at single-base resolution in five human iPSC lines, along with methylomes of ES cells, somatic cells, and differentiated iPSCs and ES cells. iPSCs show significant reprogramming variability, including somatic memory and aberrant reprogramming of DNA methylation. iPSCs share megabase-scale differentially methylated regions proximal to centromeres and telomeres that display incomplete reprogramming of non-CG methylation, and differences in CG methylation and histone modifications. Lastly, differentiation of iPSCs into trophoblast cells revealed that errors in reprogramming CG methylation are transmitted at a high frequency, providing an iPSC reprogramming signature that is maintained after differentiation. Epigenomic reprogramming of somatic cells to produce iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells has important therapeutic potential and is the basis of potentially important disease models. Recent reports that the reprogramming and in vitro culture of iPS cells can induce genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raise concerns over the implications of these abnormalities for clinical applications of iPS cells. Three papers in this issue present genomics studies of human iPS and embryonic stem (ES) cells, and taken together, the results confirm that chromosomal, subchromosomal and single-base level anomalies do accumulate in iPS cells. Hussein et al. compare copy number alterations of early and intermediate passage human iPS cells and report a higher level of copy number variations associated with reprogramming. During moderate length culture, however, iPS cells undergo a selection process leading to a decreased mutation load equivalent to that seen in ES cells. Gore et al. report protein-coding point mutations in 22 human iPS cell lines reprogrammed using five different methods; some mutations were pre-existing in the somatic cells, others were new mutations linked to reprogramming. Lister et al. used whole-genome DNA methylation profiling of human ES, iPS and somatic progenitor cell lines to reveal 'hotspots' in the genomes of iPS cells that are aberrantly reprogrammed. Reprogramming of somatic cells to induce pluripotent cellular properties that closely resemble those of embryonic stem (ES) cells has important therapeutic potential. The first whole genome single-base resolution profiling of the DNA methylomes of several human ES cell, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and somatic progenitor lines shows that iPSCs are fundamentally distinct from ES cells, insofar as they manifest common, quantifiable epigenomic differences. These 'hotspots of aberrant reprogramming' might be potentially useful as diagnostic markers for incomplete iPSC reprogramming, for the characterization of the efficacy of different reprogramming techniques, and for screening the potential propagation of altered methylation states into derivative differentiated cells."

https://openalex.org/W2116126626,"Genomic structural variants (SVs) are abundant in humans, differing from other forms of variation in extent, origin and functional impact. Despite progress in SV characterization, the nucleotide resolution architecture of most SVs remains unknown. We constructed a map of unbalanced SVs (that is, copy number variants) based on whole genome DNA sequencing data from 185 human genomes, integrating evidence from complementary SV discovery approaches with extensive experimental validations. Our map encompassed 22,025 deletions and 6,000 additional SVs, including insertions and tandem duplications. Most SVs (53%) were mapped to nucleotide resolution, which facilitated analysing their origin and functional impact. We examined numerous whole and partial gene deletions with a genotyping approach and observed a depletion of gene disruptions amongst high frequency deletions. Furthermore, we observed differences in the size spectra of SVs originating from distinct formation mechanisms, and constructed a map of SV hotspots formed by common mechanisms. Our analytical framework and SV map serves as a resource for sequencing-based association studies. Copy number variations (or CNVs) are large-scale deletions, duplications and insertions that contribute significantly to genetic variation in the human genome, and many CNVs are linked to susceptibility to disease. A high-resolution map of CNVs has now been produced by harnessing information from whole-genome sequencing in 185 individuals. Nucleotide resolution of the map facilitates analysis of structural variant distribution and identification of the mechanisms of their origin. The study provides a resource for sequence-based association studies.

https://openalex.org/W2020637107,"When an extrasolar planet passes in front of (transits) its star, its radius can be measured from the decrease in starlight and its orbital period from the time between transits. Multiple planets transiting the same star reveal much more: period ratios determine stability and dynamics, mutual gravitational interactions reflect planet masses and orbital shapes, and the fraction of transiting planets observed as multiples has implications for the planarity of planetary systems. But few stars have more than one known transiting planet, and none has more than three. Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of a single Sun-like star, which we call Kepler-11, that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital periods between 10 and 47 days and a sixth planet with a longer period. The five inner planets are among the smallest for which mass and size have both been measured, and these measurements imply substantial envelopes of light gases. The degree of coplanarity and proximity of the planetary orbits imply energy dissipation near the end of planet formation. NASA's Kepler mission, a space observatory designed to detect and study extrasolar planets that transit across the disk of their host star, has hit the jackpot with the discovery of a six-planet system orbiting a Sun-like star now named Kepler-11. Five of the planets have orbital periods of between 10 and 47 days, and these are among the smallest for which size and mass have both been measured. The sixth and outermost transiting planet has been less well characterized thus far. Only one other star has more than one confirmed transiting planet (Kepler-9, which has three). This newly discovered system resembles our own Solar System in being close to coplanar, but Kepler-11's planets orbit much closer to their star. Kepler is due to continue to return data on Kepler-11 and its planets for some time yet, and it should provide many valuable constraints on models of the formation and evolution of solar systems in general. When an extrasolar planet passes in front of its star (transits), its radius can be measured from the decrease in starlight and its orbital period from the time between transits. This study reports Kepler spacecraft observations of a single Sun-like star that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital periods between 10 and 47 days plus a sixth one with a longer period.

https://openalex.org/W2167099394,"Determining the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of atoms in crystalline nanoparticles is important for nanometre-scale device engineering and also for applications involving nanoparticles, such as optoelectronics or catalysis. A nanoparticle's physical and chemical properties are controlled by its exact 3D morphology, structure and composition. Electron tomography enables the recovery of the shape of a nanoparticle from a series of projection images. Although atomic-resolution electron microscopy has been feasible for nearly four decades, neither electron tomography nor any other experimental technique has yet demonstrated atomic resolution in three dimensions. Here we report the 3D reconstruction of a complex crystalline nanoparticle at atomic resolution. To achieve this, we combined aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, statistical parameter estimation theory and discrete tomography. Unlike conventional electron tomography, only two images of the target--a silver nanoparticle embedded in an aluminium matrix--are sufficient for the reconstruction when combined with available knowledge about the particle's crystallographic structure. Additional projections confirm the reliability of the result. The results we present help close the gap between the atomic resolution achievable in two-dimensional electron micrographs and the coarser resolution that has hitherto been obtained by conventional electron tomography."
https://openalex.org/W1964636114,"Using a Smad4/Pten null transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer, Ding et al. show that the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling pathway limits tumour progression and metastasis. By utilizing markers of this pathway and other biologically relevant factors, they develop a four-gene signature that is associated with poorer clinical outcome and metastatic progression in several prostate cancer cohorts, especially in combination with other clinical parameters. This signature may prove useful as a basis for an improved prognostic test for those cases of prostate cancer in which deciding on the right treatment regime while avoiding over-treatment is an important clinical challenge. In a mouse model of prostate cancer it is found that that the TGF-β signalling pathway limits tumour progression and metastasis. Using markers of this pathway and other biologically relevant factors, a four-gene signature is identified that is associated with poorer clinical outcome and metastatic progression in several prostate cancer cohorts, especially in combination with other clinical parameters. This signature may prove useful for the development of a better prognostic test for those cases of prostate cancer in which deciding on the right treatment regime while avoiding over-treatment constitutes an important clinical challenge. Effective clinical management of prostate cancer (PCA) has been challenged by significant intratumoural heterogeneity on the genomic and pathological levels and limited understanding of the genetic elements governing disease progression1. Here, we exploited the experimental merits of the mouse to test the hypothesis that pathways constraining progression might be activated in indolent Pten-null mouse prostate tumours and that inactivation of such progression barriers in mice would engender a metastasis-prone condition. Comparative transcriptomic and canonical pathway analyses, followed by biochemical confirmation, of normal prostate epithelium versus poorly progressive Pten-null prostate cancers revealed robust activation of the TGFβ/BMP–SMAD4 signalling axis. The functional relevance of SMAD4 was further supported by emergence of invasive, metastatic and lethal prostate cancers with 100% penetrance upon genetic deletion of Smad4 in the Pten-null mouse prostate. Pathological and molecular analysis as well as transcriptomic knowledge-based pathway profiling of emerging tumours identified cell proliferation and invasion as two cardinal tumour biological features in the metastatic Smad4/Pten-null PCA model. Follow-on pathological and functional assessment confirmed cyclin D1 and SPP1 as key mediators of these biological processes, which together with PTEN and SMAD4, form a four-gene signature that is prognostic of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence and lethal metastasis in human PCA. This model-informed progression analysis, together with genetic, functional and translational studies, establishes SMAD4 as a key regulator of PCA progression in mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2052528558,"The very first stars to form in the Universe heralded an end to the cosmic dark ages and introduced new physical processes that shaped early cosmic evolution. Until now, it was thought that these stars lived short, solitary lives, with only one extremely massive star, or possibly a very wide binary system, forming in each dark matter minihalo. Here we describe numerical simulations that show that these stars were, to the contrary, often members of tight multiple systems. Our results show that the disks that formed around the first young stars were unstable to gravitational fragmentation, possibly producing small binary and higher-order systems that had separations as small as the distance between the Earth and the Sun."

IntroductionParkinson disease (PD) 4The abbreviations used are: PDParkinson diseaseCHXcycloheximideDrp1dynamin-related protein 1UBubiquitinMBPmaltose-binding protein. is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases affecting over 2% populations over 65 years of age. It is classically characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons that project from the midbrain substantia nigra to the striatum (1Ishikawa A. Tsuji S.

Although the loss of dopaminergic neurons is responsible for the symptom of movement disorder in PD, it is now clear that other types of neurons throughout the brain are also affected in the disease (3Braak H.

Even though a number of the putative substrates have been identified, the causative link between these substrates and the PD pathogenesis remains not fully understood.Over the past few decades, accumulating evidence has suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting oxidative damage are associated with PD.

We thus sought to address the molecular details on how Parkin regulates mitochondrial fission and fusion in mammalian systems. To this end, we have identified Drp1 as a novel substrate of Parkin which effectively promotes the proteasome dependent degradation of Drp1. Our results thus uncover a novel mechanism linking loss of Parkin to mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PD and suggest that Drp1 could be a potential target for fighting against this currently incurable disease.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have found that Drp1 is a novel substrate of Parkin. Parkin effectively promotes the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of Drp1. Our results implicate a potential role for Parkin dysregulation in mitochondrial dynamics and PD pathogenesis. Because the role of the Parkin mutation in the pathogenesis of PD has been well established, it has long been speculated that this event could result in the accumulation of its substrates affecting mitochondrial morphology and functions (18Kahle P.J. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A number of substrates of Parkin have been identified, and deregulation of these substrates are responsible for the symptoms of neurodegenerative disease such as PD (14Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Kahle P.J. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the direct connection of these substrates with the mitochondrial dysfunction widely observed in PD is remains elusive. Our results thus suggest a straightforward mechanism for how mutations of Parkin impact mitochondrial integrity and functions, leading to PD.Our results demonstrate that Parkin interacts with and subsequently ubiquitinates Drp1, a mitochondrial fission factor, resulting in the degradation of Drp1 by the proteasome-dependent pathway. The second ring finger domain of Parkin appears to be important for its interaction with Drp1. Mutations or deletion in this region may result in the loss of the E3 ligase activity of Parkin and/or affect its interaction with Drp1, thereby reducing the level of ubquitination and leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. Strong evidence has shown that, in mammalian cells, increased level of Drp1 causes mitochondrial fragmentation (31Zhu P.P. Patterson A. Stadler J. Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. Blackstone C. J. Biol.

Accumulation of mitofusin leads to enhanced mitochondrial aggregation and is protective to the mitochondrial dysfunctions and apoptosis (51Sugioka R. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52726-52734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These results are in contrast to the recent reports showing that, in Drosophila, Parkin promotes mitochondrial fission (39Poole A.C. Thomas R.E. Andrews L.A. McBride H.M. Whitworth A.J. Pallanck L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 40Deng H. Dodson M.W. Huang H. Guo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tao R.N. Whitworth A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy may be because Parkin regulates mitochondrial fission and fusion differently in distinct systems, and this warrants further clarification. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the recent report that knockdown of Parkin leads to mitochondrial fragmentation (48Lutz A.K. Exner N. Fett M.E. Schlehe J.S. Kloos K. Lämmermann K. Brunner B. Kurz-Drexler A. Vogel F. Reichert A.S. Bouman L. Vogt-Weisenhorn D. Wurst W. Tatzelt J. Haass C. Winklhofer K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22938-22951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that one of the important functions of Parkin is to keep the cellular Drp1 level under control for proper mitochondrial functions.Drp1 is the major factor responsible for mitochondrial fission (29Chen H. Chan D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R283-R289Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 33Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), which is one of the early events for neuronal cell death and the development of PD and other types of neurodegenerative diseases (20Cho D.H. Nakamura T. Fang J. Cieplak P. Godzik A. Gu Z. Lipton S.A. Science. 2009; 324: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Our results uncover a novel regulatory pathway of Drp1 by ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation involving a cytosolic E3 ligase. E3 ubiquitin ligases localized in mitochondria, such as MARCH5/MITOL and Mulan, have been shown to regulate mitochondrial fission by interaction with Drp1 and another mitochondrial fission factor Fis1 (52Li W. Bengtson M.H. Ulbrich A. Matsuda A. Reddy V.A. Orth A. Chanda S.K. Batalov S. Joazeiro C.A. PloS One. 2008; 3: e1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 53Nakamura N. Kimura Y. Tokuda M. Honda S. Hirose S. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, Parkin is the first cytosolic E3 ligase identified to regulate Drp1 turnover. Parkin is known to interact with PINK1/DJ1 (54Xiong H. Wang D. Chen L. Choo Y.S. Ma H. Tang C. Xia K. Jiang W. Ronai Z. Zhuang X. Zhang Z. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) to regulate protein ubiquitination and degradation. It would be interesting to examine whether this type of interaction is also important for monitoring the Drp1 level in mitochondria. Recently, strong evidence has shown that Parkin is recruited onto damaged mitochondria to mediate mitophagy, a process for eliminating damaged or unwanted mitochondria (55Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar, 56Geisler S. Holmström K.M. Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). Loss of PINK1 function promotes mitophagy in a Parkin- and Drp1-dependent manner (46Dagda R.K. Cherra 3rd, S.J. Kulich S.M. Tandon A. Park D. Chu C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13843-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). It is possible that Parkin has dual roles for mitochondrial homeostasis and quality control. On one hand, it is able to keep cellular Drp1 levels in check to prevent mitochondrial fragmentation. Once it is recruited toward depolarized mitochondria, Parkin may help remove damaged mitochondria. It is of interest to note that ubiquitination of proteins promotes both protein degradation and selective removal of unwanted protein aggregates or damaged organelles. Dysregulation of these processes may cause mitochondrial fragmentation and accumulation of damaged mitochondria for subsequent cell death and neural diseases.It is possible that dysregulation of the Parkin/Drp1 axis represents one of the early events predisposing susceptibility of neuronal cells to intracellular or environmental changes because mitochondrial fragmentation is tightly associated with the loss of mitochondrial functions and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative stress. Investigation of how the Parkin/Drp1 axis is regulated may help elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of PD and design new treatment strategies, in addition to a better understanding of mitochondrial homeostasis. IntroductionParkinson disease (PD) 4The abbreviations used are: PDParkinson diseaseCHXcycloheximideDrp1dynamin-related protein 1UBubiquitinMBPmaltose-binding protein. is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases affecting over 2% populations over 65 years of age. It is classically characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons that project from the midbrain substantia nigra to the striatum (1Ishikawa A. Tsuji S. Neurology. 1996; 47: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Thomas B. Beal M.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: R183-R194Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Although the loss of dopaminergic neurons is responsible for the symptom of movement disorder in PD, it is now clear that other types of neurons throughout the brain are also affected in the disease (3Braak H. Ghebremedhin E. Rüb U. Bratzke H. Del Tredici K. Cell Tissue Res. 2004; 318: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar, 4Ferrer I. Prog.

The identification of genes linking to PD has greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease (5Farrer M.J. Nat. Rev.

A handful of substrates have been identified, including Parkin itself and CDCrel-1, synphilin-1, Pael-R, glycosylated α-synuclein, FBP1 (far upstream element-binding protein 1), and the RNA-processing protein subunit p38/AIMP2 (16Corti O.

A putative mechanism by which mutations of Parkin cause PD would be abnormal accumulation and aggregation of the above substrates due to insufficient E3 ligase activity for ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent protein turnover (18Kahle P.J. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Cho D.H. Nakamura T. Fang J. Cieplak P. Godzik A. Gu Z. Lipton S.A.

Surprisingly, only p38/AIMP2 and FBP1 were found to be accumulated in the brain samples of PD patients or in Parkin knock-out mice (16Corti O. Hampe C. Koutnikova H. Darios F. Jacquier S. Prigent A.

Even though a number of the putative substrates have been identified, the causative link between these substrates and the PD pathogenesis remains not fully understood.Over the past few decades, accumulating evidence has suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting oxidative damage are associated with PD. This is supported by a large number of reports demonstrating impaired mitochondrial functions in PD patients (22Lin M.T. Beal M.F.

Mitochondria undergo frequent fission, fusion, and redistribution throughout the cytoplasm in response to the energy needs (27Yaffe M.P. Nat.

Either disruption of the fusion process or enhancement of the fission process renders the normal, tubular network of mitochondria to fragment into short rods or spheres (29Chen H. Chan D.C. Hum. Mol.

Glycosylation of proteins at naïve sites (ones that normally are not glycosylated) could be useful for therapeutic and research applications but currently results in unpredictable changes to protein stability. We show that placing a phenylalanine residue two or three positions before a glycosylated asparagine in distinct reverse turns facilitates stabilizing interactions between the aromatic side chain and the first N-acetylglucosamine of the glycan. Glycosylating this portable structural module, an enhanced aromatic sequon, in three different proteins stabilizes their native states by -0.7 to -2.0 kilocalories per mole and increases cellular glycosylation efficiency."

However, interactions between the atoms may lead to shifts in the frequency of the clock transition, usually proportional to the atomic density. Swallows et al. (p. 1043 , published online 3 February) demonstrate an opposite and unexpected effect of interactions: For sufficiently strongly interacting systems, the frequency shift is suppressed. Indeed, in a strontium-based fermionic lattice clock, the shift and its associated spread were reduced by an order of magnitude."

This shift requires energy transfer over distances an order of magnitude greater than previously reported for bulk conjugated polymers and far greater than predicted by the standard mechanism for exciton quenching, the unbiased diffusion of free excitons to quenching sites.

We have developed a highly sensitive in vitro monitoring method using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and toxicity assays. Using Aβ labeled at the N terminus or Lys16, we uncovered two distinct assembly pathways. One leads to highly toxic 10–15-nm spherical Aβ assemblies, termed amylospheroids (ASPDs). The other leads to fibrils. The first step in ASPD formation is trimerization. ASPDs of ∼330 kDa in mass form from these trimers after 5 h of slow rotation. Up to at least 24 h, ASPDs remain the dominant structures in assembly reactions. Neurotoxicity studies reveal that the most toxic ASPDs are ∼128 kDa (∼32-mers). In contrast, fibrillogenesis begins with dimer formation and then proceeds to formation of 15–40-nm spherical intermediates, from which fibrils originate after 15 h. Unlike ASPD formation, the Lys16-labeled peptide disturbed fibril formation because the Aβ16–20 region is critical for this final step.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2866-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Indeed, Aβ dimers that induce synaptic impairment and not neuronal loss have been reported to be isolated from AD brains (18Shankar G.M. Li S. Mehta T.H. Garcia-Munoz A. Shepardson N.E. Smith I. Brett F.M. Farrell M.A. Rowan M.J. Lemere C.A. Regan C.M. Walsh D.M. Sabatini B.L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). In contrast, the molecular natures of the Aβ assemblies that directly cause neuronal loss in human AD remain to be elucidated. Because neuronal loss causes cognitive deterioration in AD patients (19Perrin R.J. Fagan A.M. Holtzman D.M. Nature. 2009; 461: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we sought to isolate such Aβ assemblies in vivo. As a first step, we prepared highly toxic 10–15-nm spherical Aβ assemblies termed ASPDs using an in vitro assembly system (10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). ASPDs are not fibril intermediates because they are not incorporated into mature fibrils and continue to exist after fibril formation ceases (5Roychaudhuri R. Yang M. Hoshi M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4749-4753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). They also differ from protofibrils and Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) in morphology and size (10Hoshi M. Sato M.

Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar)). Recently, we have produced ASPD-specific antibodies and used them to selectively immunoisolate highly neurotoxic ASPDs from human AD brains (21Noguchi A. Matsumura S. Dezawa M. Tada M. Yanazawa M. Ito A. Akioka M. Kikuchi S. Sato M. Ideno S. Noda M. Fukunari A. Muramatsu S. Itokazu Y. Sato K. Takahashi H. Teplow D.B. Nabeshima Y. Kakita A. Imahori K. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32895-32905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), strengthening the hypothesis that ASPDs are effectors of neurodegeneration in situ in humans. We also found that ASPD concentration correlated with the pathological severity of AD (21Noguchi A. Matsumura S. Dezawa M. Tada M. Yanazawa M. Ito A. Akioka M. Kikuchi S. Sato M. Ideno S. Noda M. Fukunari A. Muramatsu S. Itokazu Y. Sato K. Takahashi H. Teplow D.B. Nabeshima Y. Kakita A. Imahori K. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32895-32905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that native ASPDs might be a candidate for Aβ assemblies that directly cause neuronal loss in human AD brains. The immunoreactivity profile of ASPD-specific antibodies in comparison to that of anti-Aβ antibodies or of an anti-oligomer A11 antibody suggests that ASPDs are structurally distinct from dimers, ADDLs, and A11-reactive entities (21Noguchi A. Matsumura S. Dezawa M. Tada M. Yanazawa M. Ito A. Akioka M. Kikuchi S. Sato M. Ideno S. Noda M. Fukunari A. Muramatsu S. Itokazu Y. Sato K. Takahashi H. Teplow D.B. Nabeshima Y. Kakita A. Imahori K. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32895-32905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Taken together, data extant suggest that distinct types of Aβ assemblies, with distinct neurotoxic activities, exist in the AD brain. Therefore, elucidation of the assembly state-neurotoxicity relationships of these assemblies is important for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, we use combined FCS, TEM, and toxicity analyses to address these issues and to provide a highly sensitive and reliable method for in situ monitoring of the assembly process. At present, the assembly process cannot be monitored directly in vivo and much higher sensitivity is required for reliably monitoring in vitro formation of nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies, which occurs at low protein concentration (5Roychaudhuri R. Yang M. Hoshi M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4749-4753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 20Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. J.

Our approach should therefore be useful in studies of other amyloid proteins. FCS involves autocorrelation of fluctuations of fluorescence intensity, which gives the average number and average diffusion time (i.e. molecular size) of fluorescent molecules as they diffuse through an illuminated volume (26Gösch M. Rigler R. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 169-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We employed FCS because FCS provides the highest sensitivity for detecting small assemblies in dilute solutions among available analytical techniques (small angle x-ray diffraction, ultracentrifugation, laser light scattering, etc.). In addition, FCS does not require physical separation of metastable assemblies, and its noninvasive character allows monitoring without perturbation of monomer-nonfibrillar assembly-fibril equilibria (27Björling S.

Haupt M. Riesner D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and the formation of large (>104 kDa) fibrillar assemblies from Aβ1–40 in vitro (29Tjernberg L.O.

Garai K. Sahoo B. Shi Y. Callaway D.J. Maiti S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10506-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), little is known about the formation of neurotoxic nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies. Here, by using combined FCS, TEM, and toxicity analyses, we uncovered two distinct assembly pathways, one leading to ASPDs and the other to fibrils. We also determined the mass (128 ± 44 kDa) and height (7.2 ± 2.6 nm) of the most toxic ASPDs. The observed differences in the assembly pathways clearly indicated that ASPDs are not fibril precuorsors. ASPD-specific antibodies, a rabbit polyclonal rpASD1 (Kd ≈ 5 pm) and a hamster monoclonal haASD1 (Kd ≈ 0.5 pm), have been produced in our laboratory and recognize epitopes distinct from those present on dimers, A11 antibody-reactive 12-mers, or fibrils (21Noguchi A. Matsumura S. Dezawa M. Tada M. Yanazawa M. Ito A. Akioka M. Kikuchi S. Sato M. Ideno S. Noda M. Fukunari A. Muramatsu S. Itokazu Y. Sato K. Takahashi H. Teplow D.B. Nabeshima Y. Kakita A. Imahori K. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32895-32905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The characteristics of these ASPD tertiary structure-dependent antibodies are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Fluorescent probes, Aβ1–40 site-specifically labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) either at the N terminus (NTR) or Lys16 (K16TR), were synthesized (supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). ASPDs were prepared in vitro from 50 μm solutions of Aβ1–42 (with or without 0.1 μm NTR or K16TR; a probe ratio of 1/500) in F12 buffer without riboflavine, l-glutamine, and phenol red by slowly rotating the solutions at 4 °C for 16.5 h (10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Their quality was confirmed by dot blotting, TEM, and toxicity assays. Spherical assemblies 10–15 nm in diameter, with rare fibril-like structures, were usually produced as major components (10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Fibrils were prepared from 100 μm solutions of Aβ1–40 (with or without 0.1 μm NTR or K16TR; a probe ratio of 1/1000) in 0.5× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS) at pH 3.5 by slowly rotating the solutions at 4 °C for 2 days. Fibrils without ASPDs were detected by TEM. Aβ concentration of each preparation was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (Waters AccQ-Tag system) (10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). FCS was performed with a confocal volume element of 0.3 femtoliters using a preproduction prototype apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). The fluorescence intensity fluctuations were detected using a photomultiplier tube, and the autocorrelation function was calculated using a digital correlator (Fig. 1A; see also supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). Each sample (20 μl) was measured at room temperature for 3 s × 10 times using free rhodamine 6G (479 Da in mass, 2.8 × 10−10 m2 s−1 in the diffusion coefficient (D)) or Alexa Fluor 532 C5 maleimide (813 Da, 2.8 × 10−10 m2 s−1) as reference dyes. At the onset of the assembly process, Aβ solutions mainly contain rapidly diffusing Aβ assemblies ranging in mass from monomers to trimers. Some other assemblies may also be present, but their concentrations are unpredictable. Therefore, the constrained regularization program CONTIN (32Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-227Crossref Scopus (2611) Google Scholar, 33Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2534) Google Scholar), combined with least-squares fitting, was utilized to determine the distribution of the diffusion times so that the mass of the rapidly diffusing Aβ assemblies fitted the dimer/trimer range (8∼15 kDa), without any prior assumption about the number of the assembly types in solutions. From the determined distributions, the relative abundance and diffusion time of each assembly were calculated. By comparing the diffusion time of each assembly with that of reference dyes with known mass and diffusion coefficient, the mass (for spherical assemblies such as ASPDs) or the diffusion coefficient (D) (for nonspherical assemblies such as fibrils) was determined (supplemental Fig. S3). The details are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” In FCS, the contribution of each component to the correlation curve is related to both its relative abundance and brightness (34Palmer 3rd, A.G. Thompson N.L. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). If all components have equal brightness, the relative abundance of each assembly can be obtained directly from the distribution of assembly diffusion time. This is true for ASPDs and early fibril intermediates, but not for fibrils containing more than one fluorophore. In the latter case, a rough estimate of the relative abundance of the fibrils was obtained from the distribution of the diffusion time (for details, see “In Situ Monitoring of Fibril Formation” under “Results”). To confirm the estimates thus obtained, mature fibrils were separated in the retentate fractions of 0.1-μm filters (confirmed using TEM), and their amount was directly obtained from the fluorescence count using a fluorometer (Twinkle LB970; Berthold Technologies GmbH). Immunoprecipitation (IP), TEM, fluid-phase imaging of ASPDs by atomic force microscopy, toxicity assays, and statistics are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” To monitor ASPD formation by FCS, we chemically synthesized fluorescent probes by labeling TMR site-specifically either at the N terminus (termed NTR) or at Lys16 (termed K16TR) of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 1A). We consider TMR labeling at these sites to minimally affect ASPD formation because excess Aβ1–5 (DAEFR) or Aβ16–20 (KLVFF) had no effect on ASPD formation (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that amino acid residues around Aβ1–5 or Aβ16–20 are not involved in ASPD formation. FCS was performed using a preproduction prototype apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) at 100 μW optimum laser output power (supplemental Fig. S2). From FCS data, the relative abundance (%) and diffusion time of each Aβ assembly were obtained using CONTIN (32Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-227Crossref Scopus (2611) Google Scholar, 33Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2534) Google Scholar) combined with least-squares fitting (Fig. 1A; see supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). By comparing the diffusion time of each assembly with those of reference dyes (rhodamine 6G and Alexa Fluor 532) with known mass and diffusion coefficient, either the assembly mass (for spherical assemblies such as ASPDs) or diffusion coefficient (D) (for nonspherical assemblies such as fibrils) was determined (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). First, we examined the masses of the probes by FCS. The average mass values of the probes, freshly dissolved at 0.1 μm in 0.5× PBS, were calculated to be 7.9 kDa (NTR) and 8.6 kDa (K16TR), respectively (n = 5), assuming they behave as spherical structures. Thus, these probes (4.8 kDa nominal mass) behave as dimers, like unlabeled Aβ1–40 (35Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), and should be available for incorporation into ASPDs during assembly. The result validates the accuracy of our FCS-based analytical method. Next, we examined whether ASPDs were formed in the presence of the probes. Consistent with our study using unlabeled Aβ1–42 (10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), TEM revealed the formation of 10–15-nm ASPDs in the presence of NTR or K16TR at various ratios (1/500∼1/10 of total Aβ; 16.5 h in Fig. 1B, inset). FCS detected ASPD-sized structures in the range of 100–1000 kDa (16.5 h in Fig. 1B) (10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) even at a 1/500 probe ratio. NTR- or K16TR-labeled ASPDs were indistinguishable from unlabeled ASPDs in immunoreactivity to anti-ASPD antibodies and in neurotoxicity to rat primary neuronal cultures (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, we set the probe ratio at 1/500 for subsequent experiments. Because the mass of ASPDs does not exceed 669 kDa (i.e. ∼148-mer) (21Noguchi A. Matsumura S. Dezawa M. Tada M. Yanazawa M. Ito A. Akioka M. Kikuchi S. Sato M. Ideno S. Noda M. Fukunari A. Muramatsu S. Itokazu Y. Sato K. Takahashi H. Teplow D.B. Nabeshima Y. Kakita A. Imahori K. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32895-32905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), at 1/500 probe ratio, assemblies will contain a maximum of one fluorophore per assembly, so they will have equal brightness. This means that we can obtain the relative abundance of each assembly directly from the distribution of assembly diffusion time determined by CONTIN (see “Experimental Procedures”). We then followed time-dependent changes in Aβ assembly state simultaneously using TEM and FCS (Fig. 1A). As shown previously (10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), during up to 2 h of slow rotation, TEM detected few structures except for occasional amorphous structure (Fig. 1B, arrow at 0 h in inset). During this initial phase of ASPD formation, up to 2 h, Aβ trimers (12.7 ± 1.8 kDa, 92%, n = 8) predominated (Fig. 1B). This means the first step in ASPD formation involves trimerization. Besides trimers, FCS also detected small amounts of large assemblies with varying mass and relative abundance (for time 0, 102∼107 kDa in mass, 8.4 ± 11%; for 2 h, 102∼104 kDa, 11.3 ± 7.2%; n = 8) (supplemental Fig. S4). This is consistent with the observation of low numbers of cloud-like uranyl acetate staining structures (dotted line in supplemental Fig. S4, inset), distinct from the staining of buffer-derived salts, up to 2 h in TEM. We speculate that these large species are metastable and therefore may be destroyed during sample preparation for TEM. Although it is unclear whether these species are intermediates of ASPDs, it is noteworthy that neither the cloud-like structures nor the large species with such variety in mass and relative abundance were absent at the onset of fibril formation (see “In Situ Monitoring of Fibril Formation”; see Fig. 3). After that, ASPDs appeared at 5 h of slow rotation. At this time, 5–20-nm spherical structures, mainly 10–15-nm ASPD-sized spheres, were observed (Fig. 1B, inset). ASPDs remained as the dominant structures from 5 h until at least 24 h (Fig. 1B, inset). In accordance with TEM observations, FCS detected an ASPD-sized assembly of 102 ∼ 103 kDa at 5 h, and its amount was increased at 16.5 h (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S4). Its mass was 330 ± 58 kDa (24 ± 7.7%, n = 5), in good agreement with that of ASPDs (∼158–669 kDa) previously estimated from glycerol-gradient sedimentation assays (5Roychaudhuri R. Yang M. Hoshi M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4749-4753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 10Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude we could monitor ASPD formation continuously and quantitatively using FCS. The two probes gave essentially identical results (Fig. 1B). We recently produced ASPD-specific antibodies (supplemental Table S1) (21Noguchi A. Matsumura S. Dezawa M. Tada M. Yanazawa M. Ito A. Akioka M. Kikuchi S. Sato M. Ideno S. Noda M. Fukunari A. Muramatsu S. Itokazu Y. Sato K. Takahashi H. Teplow D.B. Nabeshima Y. Kakita A. Imahori K. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32895-32905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and used them to selectively immunoisolate ASPDs from AD brain extracts without affecting ASPD structure or neurotoxicity (21Noguchi A. Matsumura S. Dezawa M. Tada M. Yanazawa M. Ito A. Akioka M. Kikuchi S. Sato M. Ideno S. Noda M. Fukunari A. Muramatsu S. Itokazu Y. Sato K. Takahashi H. Teplow D.B. Nabeshima Y. Kakita A. Imahori K. Hoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32895-32905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). With this method (Fig. 2A), we immunoisolated the most toxic fraction of ASPDs from unpurified ASPD preparations and determined the mass using our FCS method. Large amounts of 10–15-nm ASPDs were detected only in IP eluates of a monoclonal ASPD-specific haASD1 antibody, whereas ASPDs were undetectable in IP eluates of normal mouse IgG (Fig. 2, B and C, inset). In accordance with this, 97% of the fluorescent species in haASD1-IP eluates detected by FCS was ASPD-sized assemblies of 128 ± 44 kDa (n = 6) (Fig. 2C). The IP process mostly eliminated Aβ dimers (9.4 ± 4.0 kDa) (Fig. 2C), which had been a major component before IP (76%, n = 5, 16.5 h in Fig. 1B). The neurotoxicity of the purified ASPDs to rat primary neuronal cultures was >10 times greater than that of the unpurified ASPD preparations (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S5). These data collectively indicated that the most toxic ASPDs were concentrated by the IP procedures. Their mass estimated from FCS analysis was in good agreement with our previous sedimentation results, which indicated that the highest toxicity exists in the fraction at the migration position of 158-kDa aldolase (10Hoshi M.

Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is an unusually specific endosomal and lysosomal cysteine protease, expressed at high levels in the PTCs of the mammalian kidney. We report that mice lacking AEP accumulate a discrete set of proteins in their PTC endosomes and lysosomes, which indicates a defect in the normal catabolism of proteins captured from the filtrate. Moreover, the mice develop progressive kidney pathology, including hyperplasia of PTCs, interstitial fibrosis, development of glomerular cysts, and renal pelvis dilation. By 6 mo of age, the glomerular filtration rate in AEP-null mice dropped by almost a factor of 2, and the mice developed proteinuria. We also show that EGF receptor levels are significantly higher in AEP-null PTCs, which likely explains the hyperplasia, and we show that chemical inhibition of AEP activity suppresses down-regulation of the EGF receptor in vitro. Thus, AEP is required for normal protein catabolism by PTCs, and its loss induces proliferative and other abnormalities in the murine kidney, at least in part through defective regulation of the EGF receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2027757316,"Previously, we reported that purinergic ionotropic P2X7 receptors negatively regulate neurite formation in Neuro-2a (N2a) mouse neuroblastoma cells through a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-related mechanism. In the present study we used this cell line to investigate a parallel though faster P2X7 receptor-mediated signaling pathway, namely Ca2+-regulated exocytosis. Selective activation of P2X7 receptors evoked exocytosis as assayed by high resolution membrane capacitance measurements. Using dual-wavelength total internal reflection microscopy, we have observed both the increase in near-membrane Ca2+ concentration and the exocytosis of fluorescently labeled vesicles in response to P2X7 receptor stimulation. Moreover, activation of P2X7 receptors also affects vesicle motion in the vertical and horizontal directions, thus, involving this receptor type in the control of early steps (docking and priming) of the secretory pathway. Immunocytochemical and RT-PCR experiments evidenced that N2a cells express the three neuronal SNAREs as well as vesicular nucleotide and monoamine (VMAT-1 and VMAT-2) transporters. Biochemical measurements indicated that ionomycin induced a significant release of ATP from N2a cells. Finally, P2X7 receptor stimulation and ionomycin increased the incidence of small transient inward currents, reminiscent of postsynaptic quantal events observed at synapses. Small transient inward currents were dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and were abolished by Brilliant Blue G, suggesting they were mediated by P2X7 receptors. Altogether, these results suggest the existence of a positive feedback mechanism mediated by P2X7 receptor-stimulated exocytotic release of ATP that would act on P2X7 receptors on the same or neighbor cells to further stimulate its own release and negatively control N2a cell differentiation.

Adenine nucleotides are well recognized extracellular signaling molecules mediating many physiological functions via the P2-type of purinergic receptors. P2 receptors are subdivided into ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y subtypes (1Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1985; 16: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Up to now, seven mammalian P2X-receptor subtypes (P2X1–7) and eight mammalian P2Y-receptor subtypes (P2Y1, -2, -4, -6, -11, -12, -13, and -14) have been cloned and functionally characterized (2von Kügelgen I.

P2X receptors are non-selective cation channels mediating Na+ and Ca2+ influx across the cell membrane, which leads to cell depolarization and the ensued activation of voltage-gated channels (5Jarvis M.F. Khakh B.S. Neuropharmacology. 2009; 56: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Purinergic signaling is already present at early stages of embryogenesis wherein it is involved in proliferation, migration, and differentiation of cells from multiple structures (6Huang N. Wang D.J. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 7904-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Neurosci.

Likewise, different purinergic receptors have been identified in a variety of both primary tumors and cell lines (10Deli T. Csernoch L. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2008; 14: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11White N. Burnstock G. Trends J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this respect, recent data from our laboratory have shown that mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2-a cells (henceforth referred to as N2a 4The abbreviations used are: N2aNeuro-2aBoNT/Abotulinum neurotoxin ABBGBrilliant Blue GBzATP2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl ATPNEMN-ethylmaleimideSTICsmall transient inward currentTIRFMtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopySNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein (NSF) receptorfFfemtofaradayLDCVlarge dense-core vesicle. cells) express ionotropic P2X7 receptors mediating cation currents that are selectively blocked by Brilliant Blue G (BBG) (12Gómez-Villafuertes R. del Puerto A. Díaz-Hernández M. Bustillo D. Díaz-Hernández J.I. Huerta P.G. Artalejo A.R. Garrido J.J. Miras-Portugal M.T. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5307-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As is also the case for hippocampal neurons (13Díaz-Hernandez M. del Puerto A. Díaz-Hernandez J.I. Diez-Zaera M. Lucas J.J. Garrido J.J. Miras-Portugal M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), P2X7 receptors negatively regulate neurite formation in N2a cells through a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-related mechanism (12Gómez-Villafuertes R. del Puerto A. Díaz-Hernández M. Bustillo D. Díaz-Hernández J.I. Huerta P.G. Artalejo A.R. Garrido J.J. Miras-Portugal M.T. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5307-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, either by inhibiting P2X7 receptor activity with BBG or silencing its expression with shRNA, an increased neuritogenesis could be observed in N2a cell cultures. On the contrary, P2X7 receptor overexpression resulted in a significant reduction in the formation of neurites. These results imply the existence of an endogenous purinergic tone acting on P2X7 receptors to control neuronal differentiation of N2a cells. Interestingly, neuroblastoma cells are capable of releasing a variety of mediators including substance P and ATP itself (14Muñoz M. Rosso M. Pérez A. Coveñas R. Rosso R. Zamarriego C. Piruat J.I. Neuropeptides. 2005; 39: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Raffaghello L. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Pistoia V. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and P2X7 receptor stimulation is also coupled to ATP release from human ACN neuroblastoma cells (16Pellegatti P. Falzoni S. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Di Virgilio F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, very little is known about the mechanisms involved in such a release process and, particularly, as to whether P2X7 receptors could be coupled to exocytosis from this sort of cells. In the present study we have addressed this issue by identifying in N2a cells several essential proteins of the exocytotic apparatus of sympathetic neurons, including the vesicular catecholamine and nucleotide transporters, and by measuring exocytosis with both electrophysiological and imaging techniques in the presence of selective P2X7 receptor agents. Biochemical measurements based on the luciferin-luciferase reaction indicated that, in effect, N2a cells release ATP. Moreover, in clusters of N2a cells we report the detection of small transient inward currents (STICs), which are likely generated by the quantal release of ATP. Altogether, our results indicate that P2X7 receptors are coupled to exocytosis and to the regulation of secretory vesicle dynamics in N2a cells, and they suggest that the exocytotic release of ATP induced by P2X7 receptor stimulation could mediate the tonic inhibition of neurite formation exerted by P2X7 receptors in N2a cells.

ARL 67156 was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Fura-2 AM, fluo-4 AM, rhod-2 AM, and Lysotracker red DND-99 were from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) was purified as previously described (17Rummel A. Mahrhold S. Bigalke H. Binz T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Murine Neuro-2a (ATCC® number CCL-131TM) cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with Glutamax® (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (EuroClone, Padova, Italy). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Electrophysiological recordings were performed with an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier using the PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany). Pipettes were pulled from Kimax borosilicate glass (Witz Scientific, Holland, OH) and subsequently wax-coated and fire-polished to obtain a final resistance of 2–3 megaohms when filled with standard solutions. The standard extracellular solution (Mg2+-free Locke's buffer) had the following composition: 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.5 mm glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH; 294 mosm). External Ca2+-free solution had CaCl2 replaced by 1 mm MgCl2. Recording pipettes were filled with a solution containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, adjusted with KOH; 290 mosm). Cells attached to glass coverslips (104 cells/ml) were transferred to a recording chamber placed on the stage of an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope and continuously superfused with Locke's buffer (perfusion rate of 1 ml min−1). Membrane currents were measured in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar), filtered at 2 kHz, and sampled at 10 KHz. Series resistance was compensated by 80% and monitored throughout the experiment together with the cell membrane capacitance. STICs were analyzed off-line using PatchMaster to calculate peak amplitude, rise time (20–80% of the peak amplitude), and half-decay time (to 50% of peak amplitude). Such events were detected using amplitude threshold set to 3 times the S.D. of the noise, and each of them was visually inspected and additionally filtered to avoid artifactual noise components. Exocytosis was estimated by the membrane capacitance increment according to the Lindau-Neher technique implemented as the “Sine + D” feature of the PatchMaster lock-in module (19Lindau M. Neher E. Pflugers Arch. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 20Carabelli V. Giancippoli A. Baldelli P. Carbone E. Artalejo A.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1326-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A 1-kHz, 70-mV peak-to-peak amplitude sinusoidal function was superimposed onto the holding voltage (Vh; −70 mV). To determine the change in capacitance values, membrane capacitance was first averaged over 2 s preceding purinergic agonist (BzATP) or plain Locke's solution application to give a base-line value; this was subtracted from the value estimated after drug or saline administration averaged over a 10-s window, excluding the first 1 s to avoid contamination by nonsecretory capacitative or purinergic currents. Experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). Modified solutions and drugs were applied onto the cell under investigation by means of a gravity-driven perfusion system with 5 independent lines controlled by electronic valves (The Lee Co., Westbrook, CO). This system allowed the exchange of the medium surrounding a cell in less than 200 ms. In experiments involving the recording of STICs, drugs were locally applied by pressure ejection from a patch-pipette (2–5 μm tip diameter) placed few μm away from a cell cluster. Pressure pulses were delivered by an electronically controlled air pump (MPCU, List Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany) at low amplitudes (5–10 cm H2O) to reduce bulk movement of the extracellular fluid. Stock solutions of drugs were diluted daily in extracellular saline and incorporated into the perfusion system a few minutes before starting the experiments. The TIRF system was based on a IX81 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 100×, 1.45 NA, Plan Apochromat Olympus objective (pixel size, 80 nm). Two laser beams emitting at 488 and 561 nm were used to alternately illuminate the cell footprint, and the corresponding fluorescence signals were band-pass-filtered with a dual-band (emission between 500–550 nm and 580–620 nm) filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). A filter wheel-based epifluorescence illumination system (MT20; Olympus) was also coupled to the setup by using an Olympus TIRFM IX2-RFACA attachment system. Imaging was performed with a C9100 EM-CCD digital camera from Hamamatsu (Hamamatsu) controlled by CellR software (Olympus). Separated images corresponding to each of the laser illumination sources were acquired at a rate of 20 Hz to detect vesicle fusion or 1 Hz to monitor vesicle motion. Exposure time was 10 and 50 ms, respectively. TIRFM calibration was performed according to Wu et al. (21Wu Z.X. Xia S. Xu L. Bai L. Xu T. Sheng wu hua xue yu sheng wu wu li xue bao Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica. 2003; 35: 381-386PubMed Google Scholar), and decay constant of the evanescent field (1/e depth) was determined to be 160 ± 28 nm. Different combinations of fluorescent dyes were used to label the cells. In experiments aimed at simultaneously determining vesicle fusion and the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), N2a cells plated on coverslips inside 35-mm cell culture dishes (2.5 × 105 cells/dish) were loaded with quinacrine (2 μm; excited by 488-nm light) and rhod-2 AM (10 μm; excited by 561-nm light) for 20 min at 37 °C. At variance, N2a cells were incubated with Lysotracker red (2 μm; excited by 561-nm light) and fluo-4 AM (10 μm; excited by 488 nm light) in experiments designed to monitor vesicular motion as well as [Ca2+]i. Fusion of a vesicle and release of its content into the extracellular space was detected as a rapid loss of the quinacrine signal (in less than 500 ms). During the experiments, cells were continuously superfused with Locke's medium at a rate of 1.5 ml min−1, and P2X7 receptor-selective agents were applied by bath superfusion. Perfusion was gravity-driven, and solution exchange was performed by manually operating the electronic valves of a VC-6 drug application system (Warner Instruments). Experiments were performed at 37 °C. Images were processed using the ImageJ software (public domain image processing program developed by Wayne Rasband at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland) with plug-ins for image average, region of interest measurements, and particle centroid tracking. Further analysis such as determination of mean square displacement according to Qian et al. (22Qian H. Sheetz M.P. Elson E.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 910-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) and z distances according to Johns et al. (23Johns L.M. Levitan E.S. Shelden E.A. Holz R.W. Axelrod D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were performed using homemade macros for IgorPro (WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). [Ca2+]i-related signals are presented as relative fluorescent intensities (F/F0) rather than absolute concentrations. Extracellular ATP concentration was measured using ENLITEN® rLuciferase/Luciferin reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). N2a cells were grown in 6-well plates till confluence. Culture medium (100 μl) was collected under various experimental conditions and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 10-μl aliquots of supernatant were transferred to wells of a 96-well plate placed on ice. The 96-well plate was set in a FLUOstar OPTIMA Microplate Luminometer (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Offenburg, Germany), and 100 μl of rLuciferase/Luciferin reagent was automatically injected into each well at room temperature (∼25 °C). Immediately before the start of the experiments, N2a cells were bathed in Mg2+-free Locke's buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Then cells were exposed for 5 min to either plain extracellular Locke's buffer or Locke's buffer supplemented with 100 μm ARL 67156, a competitive inhibitor of ecto-ATPases (24Lévesque S.A. Lavoie E.G. Lecka J. Bigonnesse F. Sévigny J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), with 500 μm NEM or with the two compounds, and their medium was collected to measure basal ATP concentration. Thereafter, cells were stimulated by adding ionomycin (10 μm, final concentration in extracellular medium) prepared in either plain Locke's buffer or Locke's buffer containing the above-mentioned supplements. Five minutes later, extracellular medium was again collected to measure evoked ATP concentration. In another set of experiments, cells were grown for 72 h in the absence or the presence of BoNT/A (30 nm). Both controls and toxin-treated cells were incubated with ARL 67156 (100 μm; 5 min) and subsequently challenged with ionomycin (10 μm; 5 min) to elicit ATP release. ATP concentration was determined by comparison with a calibration curve generated with ATP standards diluted in the same buffer as the samples. Pooled data are shown as the means ± S.E.; n denotes the number of individual cells, vesicles, exocytotic events, or STICs considered in each particular analysis. Statistical differences were determined by the Student's t test for unpaired samples. A p value equal or smaller than 0.05 was taken as the limit of significance. It has been reported that N2a cells transiently transfected with pro-opiomelanocortin undergo calcium-regulated release of β-endorphin located to dense-core granules (25Chevrier D. Fournier H. Nault C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 79: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Koticha D.K. McCarthy E.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, N2a cells express ionotropic purinergic P2X7 receptors whose activation promotes Ca2+ entry into the cell and the ensued increase in [Ca2+]i (12Gómez-Villafuertes R. del Puerto A. Díaz-Hernández M. Bustillo D. Díaz-Hernández J.I. Huerta P.G. Artalejo A.R. Garrido J.J. Miras-Portugal M.T. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5307-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the question arises as to whether P2X7 receptors might be coupled to exocytosis in this neuroblastoma cell line. We first addressed this issue by determining the potential change in membrane capacitance elicited by P2X7 receptor stimulation. Biological membranes behave as electrical capacitors whose capacitance is in direct relation to their surface. Because exocytosis involves the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane, it implies an increase in cellular surface, which can be detected as a change in the capacitance of the cell by using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (20Carabelli V. Giancippoli A. Baldelli P. Carbone E. Artalejo A.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1326-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In these experiments we employed N2a cells seeded at a low density (104 cells/ml) and systematically chose cells with a rounded shape and isolated from neighbors (Fig. 1A). Resting membrane capacitance of N2a cells was 10.03 ± 0.33 picofarads (n = 19). Selective activation of P2X7 receptors with BzATP (100 μm for 10 s) induced inwardly directed non-desensitizing currents that were consistently associated with an increase in membrane capacitance (Fig. 1B). The mean charge of the currents evoked by BzATP was 93.15 ± 25.47 picocoulombs, and the capacitance increase was 84.77 ± 9.46 femtofarads (n = 9 cells) (Fig. 1, B and C). None of these effects could be due to an application artifact, as perfusing Locke's solution during 10 s did not cause any consistent change in whole-cell current and was associated to a capacitance increase of only 2.5 ± 2.5 femtofarads (n = 5 cells). On the contrary, it can be attributed to the activation of P2X7 receptors, as treatment with BBG (5 μm, 3 min before and during agonist application), a selective P2X7 receptor antagonist (28Jiang L.H. Mackenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), reduced the currents (12.58 ± 2.94 picocoulombs) and the capacitance increase (22.2 ± 12.23 femtofarads) evoked by BzATP by 85 and 73%, respectively (n = 5 cells) (Fig. 1, B and C). Calcium-dependent neuroexocytosis requires the formation of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein receptor) membrane fusion complex between two plasma membrane proteins, syntaxin and SNAP-25, and one vesicular protein, synaptobrevin/VAMP (29Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). SNARE complexes are disassembled due to the ATPase activity of NSF, which allows recovery of the components of the fusion complex for subsequent rounds of exocytosis (30Xu T. Ashery U. Burgoyne R.D. Neher E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3293-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NEM has been used as tool to inhibit vesicle fusion underlying the exocytosis of a variety of mediators including ATP (31Luna C. Li G. Qiu J. Challa P. Epstein D.L. Gonzalez P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 5805-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of N2a cells with 500 μm NEM for 2 min abolished the capacitance increase elicited by BzATP without reducing P2X7 receptor-mediated currents (supplemental Fig. S1). Altogether, these results indicate that P2X7 receptors are coupled to exocytosis in N2a cells. To corroborate electrophysiological results, we employed TIRFM to visualize exocytosis of individual large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) from N2a cells. In TIRFM only a thin layer close to the coverslip glass-solution interface is excited by the evanescent field generated by total reflection of the incident light, endowing this sort of microscopy with an extraordinary sensitivity to detect membrane-proximal fluorescent molecules. We made use of quinacrine, an acidophilic dye that binds ATP in catecholaminergic and peptidergic vesicles (32Bodin P. Burnstock G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 33Coco S. Calegari F. Pravettoni E. Pozzi D. Taverna E. Rosa P. Matteoli M. Verderio C. J. Biol.

LDCVs appeared as diffraction-limited fluorescent spots in the evanescent field whose penetration depth (decay constant of ≈160 nm) ensured that only labeled vesicles that are close to the cell membrane adhering to the coverslip are visualized. The number of quinacrine-labeled vesicles per N2a cell footprint was 8.03 ± 1.94, which implies an average density of 0.082 ± 0.021 vesicles/μm2 (n = 120 cells). BzATP (100 μm, 30 s) administration was followed by an increase in rhod-2 fluorescence and a reduction in the number of quinacrine fluorescence spots (Fig. 2, A–D; see supplemental Videos S1 and S2). We could not resolve short-lived bright submicrometer spots of near membrane rhod-2 fluorescence, characteristic of local [Ca2+]i elevations (35Becherer U. Moser T. Stühmer W. Oheim M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 846-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The fluorescence signal averaged over the entire footprint reflected a slow but transient increase of [Ca2+]i very much like that observed when epifluorescence measurements of global cytosolic Ca2+ are performed in N2a cells loaded with the ratiometric dye fura-2 AM (see supplemental Video S3 and Fig. S2). A rough estimate of [Ca2+]i can be obtained from the Kd of rhod-2 (570 nm), the saturating ratio Rmax = ΔF/Fmax, and the resting [Ca2+]i (36Lev-Ram V. Miyakawa H. Lasser-Ross N. Ross W.N. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Post-simulation values were in the range of 0.2–1 μm and were consistent with those obtained from fura-2 measurements using similar stimulation conditions (0.41 μm ± 0.09; n = 141 cells; see supplemental Fig. S2). As expected for a Ca2+-regulated process, exocytosis of quinacrine occurred in parallel with the elevation of [Ca2+]i (supplemental Fig. S3). It is worth noticing that Locke's superfusion of the cells was not associated to a change in [Ca2+]i (data not shown), whereas the occurrence of spontaneous exocytotic events was fairly rare. Moreover, adding BBG (5 μm) to the perfusion saline 5 min before and during BzATP application blunted the [Ca2+]i response to the P2X7 receptor agonist and markedly reduced the probability of observing exocytotic events. We expressed the frequency of exocytotic events under the different experimental conditions as the fraction (%) of quinacrine fluorescence spots that were lost over a time window of 50 s after a change in the perfusion medium. As it is depicted in Fig. 2E, the frequency of spontaneous exocytotic events was 3.17 ± 1.1% (n = 48 cells), a value that increased three times upon BzATP administration (10.29 ± 2.3%; p < 0.01; n = 52 cells). Furthermore, in the presence BBG, the fraction of exocytotic events was diminished to 3.12 ± 2.0% (n = 20 cells), a figure not significantly different from that observed in non-stimulated cells. Interestingly, in cells treated with NEM (500 μm for 2 min), the frequency of exocytosis after BzATP application was also reduced to control levels (2.988 ± 0.85%; n = 36 cells; data not shown). Likewise, BoNT/A (30 nm for 72 h), a Clostridium toxin with endopeptidase activity against SNAP-25 (37Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), reduced the percentage of quinacrine events from 10.44% (n = 48 cells) to 4.2% (n = 44 cells), an effect accompanied by the cleavage of SNAP-25 as determined by Western blot (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, TIRFM imaging confirms previous electrophysiological data involving P2X7 receptors in exocytosis from N2a cells. Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles is the result of a cascade of events comprising the anchoring of the vesicles to the plasma membrane (“docking”) and a membrane-delimited maturation process that renders the vesicles fusion-competent (“priming”). As these two processes imply the translocation and the change in mobility of vesicles, it can be directly studied with TIRFM (38Becherer U. Pasche M. Nofal S. Hof D. Matti U. Rettig J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We, thus, performed experiments to characterize the effects of BzATP on LDCV motion in N2a cells as a mean to explore the involvement of P2X7 receptors in the control of processes preceding vesicle exocytosis. To this aim, N2a cells were incubated with Lysotracker red, which labels a small fraction of LDCVs, hence, facilitating the observation of vesicle trajectories devoid of crossings. Given that Lysotracker red fluorescence is excited by 561-nm light, we employed in these experiments fluo-4, a [Ca2+]i indica"
https://openalex.org/W1974913190,"CTCF nuclear factor regulates many aspects of gene expression, largely as a transcriptional repressor or via insulator function. Its roles in cellular differentiation are not clear. Here we show an unexpected role for CTCF in myogenesis. Ctcf is expressed in myogenic structures during mouse and zebrafish development. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches in C2C12 cells revealed CTCF as a modulator of myogenesis by regulating muscle-specific gene expression. We addressed the functional connection between CTCF and myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). CTCF enhances the myogenic potential of MyoD and myogenin and establishes direct interactions with MyoD, indicating that CTCF regulates MRF-mediated muscle differentiation. Indeed, CTCF modulates functional interactions between MyoD and myogenin in co-activation of muscle-specific gene expression and facilitates MyoD recruitment to a muscle-specific promoter. Finally, ctcf loss-of-function experiments in zebrafish embryos revealed a critical role of CTCF in myogenic development and linked CTCF to broader aspects of development via regulation of Wnt signaling. We conclude that CTCF modulates MRF functional interactions in the orchestration of myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089527698,"A new role of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phosphorylation was demonstrated in the current studies by using the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) as a model. Morphine induces a low level of receptor phosphorylation and uses the PKCε pathway to induce ERK phosphorylation and receptor desensitization, whereas etorphine, fentanyl, and [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) induce extensive receptor phosphorylation and use the β-arrestin2 pathway. Blocking OPRM1 phosphorylation (by mutating Ser363, Thr370 and Ser375 to Ala) enabled etorphine, fentanyl, and DAMGO to use the PKCε pathway. This was not due to the decreased recruitment of β-arrestin2 to the receptor signaling complex, because these agonists were unable to use the PKCε pathway when β-arrestin2 was absent. In addition, overexpressing G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) decreased the ability of morphine to activate PKCε, whereas overexpressing dominant-negative GRK2 enabled etorphine, fentanyl, and DAMGO to activate PKCε. Furthermore, by overexpressing wild-type OPRM1 and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation contributes to the differential effects of agonists on dendritic spine stability. Phosphorylation blockage made etorphine, fentanyl, and DAMGO function as morphine in the primary cultures. Therefore, agonist-dependent phosphorylation of GPCR regulates the activation of the PKC pathway and the subsequent responses."
https://openalex.org/W2141254767,"Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a tumor suppressor response that induces permanent cell cycle arrest in response to oncogenic signaling. Through the combined activation of the p53-p21 and p16-Rb suppressor pathways, OIS leads to the transcriptional repression of proliferative genes. Although this protective mechanism has been essentially described in primary cells, we surprisingly observed in this study that the OIS program is conserved in established colorectal cell lines. In response to the RAS oncogene and despite the inactivation of p53 and p16INK4, HT29 cells enter senescence, up-regulate p21WAF1, and induce senescence-associated heterochromatin foci formation. The same effect was observed in response to B-RAFv600E in LS174T cells. We also observed that p21WAF1 prevents the expression of the CDC25A and PLK1 genes to induce cell cycle arrest. Using ChIP and luciferase experiments, we have observed that p21WAF1 binds to the PLK1 promoter to induce its down-regulation during OIS induction. Following 4–5 weeks, several clones were able to resume proliferation and escape this tumor suppressor pathway. Tumor progression was associated with p21WAF1 down-regulation and CDC25A and PLK1 reexpression. In addition, OIS and p21WAF1 escape was associated with an increase in DNA damage, an induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition program, and an increase in the proportion of cells expressing the CD24low/CD44high phenotype. Results also indicate that malignant cells having escaped OIS rely on survival pathways induced by Bcl-xL/MCL1 signaling. In light of these observations, it appears that the transcriptional functions of p21WAF1 are active during OIS and that the inactivation of this protein is associated with cell dedifferentiation and enhanced survival.

Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) 2The abbreviations used are: OIS, oncogene-induced senescence; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Rb, retinoblastoma; SAHF, senescence-associated heterochromatic foci; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. is a powerful antitumor mechanism that induces permanent cell cycle arrest in response to abnormal proliferative signals (1Roninson I.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2705-2715PubMed Google Scholar). Originally described in cell culture, OIS has been recently shown to occur also in vivo as an early protection against carcinogenesis. Its induction involves the combined activities of p53 and p21WAF1 to inhibit cell cycle progression and of p16INK4 and Rb to induce the transcriptional repression of proliferative genes through heterochromatin formation (2Narita M. Nũnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Senescent cells are characterized by an enlarged morphology, by an increased activity of β-galactosidase, and by the presence of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Proliferative genes are compacted within these foci to prevent cell cycle progression, generally as a consequence of Rb-mediated silencing. Therefore, through their combined inhibitory effects on cyclin-cdk complexes, the p16INK4 and p21WAF1 inhibitors play an essential role in OIS induction and in the consequent tumor suppression. The p21WAF1 protein was originally identified as a transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and as an inhibitor of cyclin-cdk complexes and DNA replication (3el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Gene inactivation studies have also demonstrated essential roles of p21WAF1 during DNA damage and chemotherapy responses (7Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 8Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Lohez O.D. Margolis R.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7660-7668PubMed Google Scholar). Besides its classical role as a cyclin-cdk inhibitor, p21WAF1 is also recruited to the promoters of cell cycle genes to prevent proliferation. We and others have shown that this protein regulates various transcription factors involved in the G0/G1 transition such as NF-κB, Myc, E2F, and STAT3 (9Coqueret O.

To regulate gene transcription, it is believed that p21WAF1 modifies the activity of the CBP histone acetylase and of the cyclin-cdk complexes associated with the initiation complex (14Bienvenu F. Barré B. Giraud S. Avril S. Coqueret O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1850-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Giraud S. Hurlstone A. Avril S. Coqueret O.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2676-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we and others have proposed that p21WAF1 simultaneously targets growth-promoting genes and cdk activity to induce cell cycle arrest (9Coqueret O. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 65-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 10Perkins N.D. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Wood A. Shilatifard A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, although transcriptional functions of p21WAF1 have been described following overexpression or in response to chemotherapy treatment, it remains to be determined whether this also occurs during OIS and which promoters are targeted by p21WAF1 to restrain an abnormal oncogenic activity. This activity has already been demonstrated for the p14ARF tumor suppressor because this protein can interact with the MYC oncogene to prevent the activation of proliferative genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments have shown that p14ARF is recruited to the promoter of MYC target genes in association with the MYC-MAX complex (20Qi Y. Gregory M.A. Li Z. Brousal J.P. West K. Hann S.R. Nature. 2004; 431: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further characterized OIS induction and the corresponding transcriptional functions of p21WAF1 in colorectal cells. Using HT29 cells as a model of an established cell line that has inactivated both p53 and p16INK4, we surprisingly observed that OIS is still functional in these cells, even though this suppressor response is essentially considered to be active in primary cells. The same effect was also noticed in LS174T cells. During OIS, we also found that p21WAF1 prevents CDC25A and PLK1 expression and binds to the promoter of the PLK1 gene. As an essential mechanism of tumor suppression, the OIS pathway has to be inactivated during tumor progression. We effectively observed that several clones escaped this protective pathway and that this was associated with the inhibition of p21WAF1 transcription and with the reexpression of CDC25A and PLK1. In addition, senescence escape was also associated with increased DNA damage and with signs of EMT. Interestingly, these malignant cells show enhanced dependence on Bcl-xL/MCL1 signaling, suggesting that proapoptotic pathways are generated during OIS escape and EMT induction. Therefore, our results indicate that OIS can be conserved in established cell lines and that p21WAF1 functions as a transcriptional inhibitor during this protective pathway. This function is inactivated during tumor escape, and this is associated with genomic instability, cell dedifferentiation, and as a consequence up-regulation of survival signals. These results also suggest that some established cell lines can still be used as an experimental model of OIS response and tumor progression. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 and LS174T (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were maintained in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza). Cultures were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide and were tested to rule out mycoplasma contamination. For transfection experiment, cells were seeded into 60-mm culture dishes and grown until 80% confluence. The empty plasmid pcDN4/T0 and the pcDNA4/H-RasV12 (or B-RAF) were stably co-transfected with the pcDNA6/TR using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were selected with 100 μg/ml blasticidin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 500 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 100 μg/ml zeocin and 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin. Oncogene expression was induced by 50 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h. RasL cell lines were obtained after 5 weeks of H-RasV12 induction. After selection, RasL cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 100 μg/ml zeocin, 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin, and 50 ng/ml doxycycline. Cells were seeded at 800 cells into 6-well cell culture plates and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then treated with 50 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 days, washed twice with PBS, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The colonies were then washed twice with water, and colonies exceeding 50 cells were visualized with a Bio-Rad Chemi Doc XRS Imaging device and counted using Quantity One imaging software (Bio-Rad). The survival fraction was determined as the ratio of the number of colonies observed with doxycycline to the number of cells without doxycycline, adjusted to the plating efficiency. Following cells lysis at 4 °C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF), lysates were sonicated and then boiled for 3 min. Proteins were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide-containing gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Following a 1-h incubation in 3% BSA, Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-H-RAS (1:1000; Santa Cruz sc-29), mouse monoclonal anti-ERK (Tyr204) (1:1000; Santa Cruz sc-7383), goat polyclonal anti-p14ARF (1:600; Santa Cruz sc-8613), rabbit monoclonal anti-p21 antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling 2947), mouse monoclonal anti-γH2Ax (1:1000; Upstate 05-636), mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (1:1000; Santa Cruz sc5286) HSC70 (1:1000, Santa Cruz sc7298), E-cadherin (1:1000; Abcam 1416). Membranes were then washed twice with TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz). Revelation was performed by chemiluminescence with a Bio-Rad Chemi Doc XRS imaging device (Bio-Rad). Cells were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates 24 h prior to transfection. Reporter constructs were transfected into HT29 cells by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, luciferase activity was determined by the Dual-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega) and measured using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. The reporter luciferase was normalized to Renilla luciferase, and the ratio of luminescence from the experimental reporter to luminescence from the control reporter was calculated. ChIP experiments were performed as described previously (21Courapied S. Sellier H. de Carné Trécesson S. Vigneron A. Bernard A.C. Gamelin E. Barré B. Coqueret O. J. Biol.

After 10 min, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 500 μl of ChIP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF). Chromatin was sheared by sonication to an average size of 500 bp. The chromatin solution was diluted with 1 volume of dilution buffer (2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform with of protein A-agarose and protein G-Sepharose which was pretreated with sheared DNA salmon sperm. Chromatin was then incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform with 1 μg of the anti-p21, anti-E2F1, or anti-GAL4 antibody. Following precipitation with protein A-agarose and protein G-Sepharose (pretreated with sheared DNA salmon sperm), chromatin was eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3) for 5 h at 65 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, allowed to air dry, and then dissolved in 100 μl of sterile H2O. Four microliters of the DNA samples were then subjected to PCR amplification. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 70% ethanol at −20 °C for 20 min. Cells were then incubated with 1 μg of anti-γH2Ax (1:50; BD Biosciences 560445), anti-CD24 (1:50; BD Biosciences 555427), or anti-CD44 (1:50; BD Biosciences 555479). Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and samples were analyzed by FACS (LSR II; BD Biosciences). To down-regulate gene expression, HT29 cells were transfected with 2.5 nm CDKN1A ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, TP53 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, MAPK14 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, or ON-TARGETplus NonTargeting Pool (all from Dharmacon) using DharmaFect-4 (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. H-RASV12 induction was done 24 h after. 10-μl drops containing 1000 cells were suspended on the lids of agar-coated 96-well plates containing 200 μl of culture medium. After a 96-h time period required for cell aggregation, the spheroids were transferred to RMPI 1640 culture medium and maintained for 8 days. The underside of the transwell (8-μm pore size; Falcon) was precoated with Matrigel (100 μg/ml; Sigma E1270) or collagen type I (Col-I; 10 μg/ml). Next, 100 cells were loaded onto the upper chamber, and the lower chamber was filled with serum-free medium. Cells were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with DAPI. Nonmigrating cells retained on the upper side were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated through the filter were counted and averaged from five randomly chosen microscopic fields using a 20× objective. Several studies have shown that oncogenes induce growth arrest and senescence, but it is generally believed that this protective pathway occurs essentially in primary cells to restrain the initial events of cell transformation (24Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar, 25Collado M. Serrano M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). To extend this observation, we wanted to determine whether OIS is conserved in established colorectal cell lines, in the absence of intact p53 and p16INK4 signaling. To this end, we generated HT29 cell lines expressing the H-RASV12 oncogene under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. p53 is mutated in this cell line, but p16INK4 is not expressed, probably as a consequence of promoter methylation. As expected, Western blot experiments indicated that RAS was up-regulated in response to doxycycline and that the ERK1/2 kinase was activated (Fig. 1A). Consequently, we observed under this condition that p14ARF was also up-regulated in response to the RAS oncogene (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, MTT and clonogenic assays showed that RAS up-regulation led to long term cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1C). In addition, cells exhibited a flat and enlarged morphology illustrative of cells entering the senescence process (data not shown). The induction of the senescence program was also detected by β-galactosidase staining (Fig. 1D), a specific marker of cells that do not divide or form colonies. Together, these results indicate that HT29 cells have conserved an intact OIS program in response to aberrant RAS signaling, even though these cells are not primary cells and p53 and p16INK4 are inactivated. We then determined whether the p21WAF1 cell cycle inhibitor was still expressed during OIS in HT29 cells. Interestingly, Western blot experiments showed a significant induction of p21WAF1 in response to the oncogene (Fig. 2A). We and others have previously described that p21WAF1 up-regulation leads to the induction of senescence (26Vigneron A. Roninson I.B. Gamelin E. Coqueret O. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8927-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Chang B.D. Watanabe K. Broude E.V. Fang J. Poole J.C. Kalinichenko T.V. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To determine whether p21WAF1 was also involved in OIS activation in colorectal cell lines, cells were transfected with a pool of four different siRNAs directed against the cell cycle inhibitor or control sequences. As expected, p21WAF1 expression was down-regulated following H-RASV12 induction (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). Using β-galactosidase staining, we noticed that the inhibition of the cell cycle inhibitor significantly prevented OIS induction (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8). As stated above, besides β-galactosidase, OIS is also characterized by the formation of the SAHF heterochromatin foci (see Fig. 6 and Ref. 2Narita M. Nũnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we noticed that the down-regulation of p21WAF1 also led to a reduction in the number of these SAHF (Fig. 2B, lanes 9–12).FIGURE 6OIS escape is associated with p21WAF1 down-regulation and CDC25A/PLK1 reexpression.

D, expression of the CDC25A (lanes 1–5) and PLK1 (lanes 7–11) mRNAs following RAS induction or in RasL cells (n = 3 ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then determined whether p21WAF1 was regulated at the transcriptional level during OIS induction. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that H-RASV12 induced a significant up-regulation of the p21WAF1 mRNA compared with noninduced cells (Fig. 2C). To determine whether this effect occurred at the transcriptional level, we monitored the expression of p21WAF1 promoter luciferase constructs following RAS up-regulation. As shown Fig. 2D, we found that the p21WAF1 promoter-driven luciferase activity was significantly up-regulated during OIS and that the −163/+70 region was sufficient to mediate the response to the RAS oncogene. Because p53 mutants have been recently reported to have unexpected functions (28Muller P.A. Caswell P.T. Doyle B. Iwanicki M.P. Tan E.H. Karim S. Lukashchuk N. Gillespie D.A. Ludwig R.L. Gosselin P. Cromer A. Brugge J.S. Sansom O.J. Norman J.C. Vousden K.H. Cell. 2009; 139: 1327-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), we have verified by RNA interference that the p21WAF1 promoter is not regulated by the mutated form of p53 under our experimental conditions (data not shown). We then examined the recruitment of the RNA polymerase to the proximal region of the promoter using ChIP. Because serine 2 phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase is a hallmark of transcriptional elongation, ChIP experiments were also performed with polyclonal antibodies directed against the phosphorylated form of the polymerase. GAL4 antibodies were used as controls, and ChIP results were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 2E). As expected, the RNA polymerase II and its elongating form were recruited to the p21WAF1 proximal promoter following H-RASV12 expression. As a control, PCR analysis did not detect any occupancy of the −2760/−2486 region of the p21WAF1 gene (data not shown). These results indicated that p21WAF1 can still be up-regulated in the established HT29 cell line in response to the H-RASV12 oncogene and during OIS induction. To extend this observation, we then asked whether this effect was only related to the HT29 cell line or whether it could also be observed in a different condition. To this end, we generated LS174T cells stably expressing the B-RAFv600E oncogene under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. As expected, Western blot experiments indicated that B-RAF was up-regulated in response to doxycycline and that the ERK1/2 kinase was phosphorylated (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, we also noticed that the p21WAF1 protein was also significantly up-regulated in this condition (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2, middle panel). Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that B-RAFv600E induced the up-regulation of the p21WAF1 mRNA compared with noninduced cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Note, however, that this induction was lower than the one observed in HT29 cells in response to H-RASV12. Compared with HT29 cells, LS174T cells do not express p16INK4 but have a functional p53 protein. To determine whether this tumor suppressor was involved in the up-regulation of p21WAF1, its expression was down-regulated by RNA interference before B-RAFv600E induction. Although reduced, the activation of p21WAF1 was still detected (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4), indicating that the cell cycle inhibitor can be induced in the absence of p53. Interestingly, using clonogenic assays, we also noticed that B-RAFv600E up-regulation led to long term cell cycle arrest in LS174T cells (Fig. 3C). Together, these results indicate that HT29 and LST174T colorectal cells have conserved the ability to up-regulate p21WAF1 and induce an OIS program in response to aberrant RAS or RAF signaling. Results presented Fig. 1B indicated that the p14ARF tumor suppressor was activated in HT29 cells in response to H-RASV12. Because this protein is well known to play an important role during senescence (29Luo J. Solimini N.L. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2009; 136: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), we inactivated its expression by RNA interference to determine its effect on p21WAF1 regulation. Western blot experiments confirmed as expected that p14ARF was down-regulated following siRNAs transfection (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4, top panel). However, we did not observe any effect on the expression of p21WAF1, suggesting that p14ARF was not implicated in the up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4, middle panel). Elegant results have recently shown that the p38 kinase is involved in the regulation of p21WAF1 expression and in senescence induction in response to abnormal oncogenic expression (30Dolado I.

Bengoechea R. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4341-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the role of this kinase in p21WAF1 regulation in our experimental conditions. Results presented in Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2, confirmed that p38 was phosphorylated following RAS induction (note that the antibodies used in these experiments are directed against the three isoforms of p38). To determine whether this kinase was involved in p21WAF1 up-regulation, cells were transfected with a pool of four specific siRNAs directed against p38 or with control sequences. As expected, p38 expression was down-regulated (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–4, top panel). Interestingly, the induction of p21WAF1 was not observed in the absence of the kinase (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1–2 and 3–4, middle panel). By contrast, we did not observe any effect on the mRNA expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, suggesting that p38 regulates the synthesis or stability of p21WAF1 as reported previously (30Dolado I. Swat A. Ajenjo N. De Vita G. Cuadrado A. Nebreda A.R. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 191-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 31Lafarga V. Cuadrado A. Lopez de Silanes I. Bengoechea R. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4341-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) but not the expression of the gene (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8). Together, we concluded from these results that the p21WAF1 protein is regulated both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels following RAS induction and OIS activation. We then determined the effect of OIS on cell cycle progression. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the percentage of cells in the G1 phase was not significantly modified whereas an increased number of cells in the G2 phase was detected after RAS induction, probably due to a reduction of cells in S phase. This distribution did not vary significantly during the 4 days that followed RAS induction (Fig. 5A). The expression of the Myc, CDC25A and PLK1 mRNAs was then evaluated because these genes are involved in G1 and G2 progression. Results presented Fig. 5B, lanes 3–6, indicate that OIS induced a down-regulation of the CDC25A and PLK1 mRNAs. Because these two genes are well known to be necessary at the G1/S and G2/M transitions, this result is consistent with the flow cytometry results. By contrast, we did not observe any modification of Myc mRNA expression (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). Following chemotherapy treatment, we have already shown that the cell cycle inhibitor binds to cell cycle genes to prevent their expression (13Vigneron A. Cherier J. Barré B. Gamelin E. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34742-34750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations suggested to us that during OIS, p21WAF1 might induce the transcriptional down-regulation of the CDC25A and PLK1 genes through promoter binding. To verify this hypothesi"
https://openalex.org/W2065578578,"One of the best characterized fusion proteins, the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), mediates fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane during viral entry into the cell. In the initial conformation of HA, its fusogenic subunit, the transmembrane protein HA2, is locked in a metastable conformation by the receptor-binding HA1 subunit of HA. Acidification in the endosome triggers HA2 refolding toward the final lowest energy conformation. Is the fusion process driven by this final conformation or, as often suggested, by the energy released by protein restructuring? Here we explored structural properties as well as the fusogenic activity of the full sized trimeric HA2(1-185) (here called HA2*) that presents the final conformation of the HA2 ectodomain. We found HA2* to mediate fusion between lipid bilayers and between biological membranes in a low pH-dependent manner. Two mutations known to inhibit HA-mediated fusion strongly inhibited the fusogenic activity of HA2*. At surface densities similar to those of HA in the influenza virus particle, HA2* formed small fusion pores but did not expand them. Our results confirm that the HA1 subunit responsible for receptor binding as well as the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of HA2 is not required for fusion pore opening and substantiate the hypothesis that the final form of HA2 is more important for fusion than the conformational change that generates this form."
https://openalex.org/W1988471126,"Runx1 transcription factor plays multiple roles in T cell development, differentiation, and function. However, the regulatory mechanisms and functional significance of high Runx1 protein expression in resting peripheral CD4+ T cells is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that T-cell receptor (TCR) activation down-regulates distal Runx1 transcription, resulting in a significant reduction of Runx1 protein. Interestingly, this down-regulation of distal Runx1 transcription appears to be mediated through a negative auto-regulatory mechanism, whereby Runx1 protein binds to a Runx consensus site in the distal promoter. Through the use of Runx1-overexpressing cells from transgenic mice, we demonstrate that interference with TCR-mediated Runx1 down-regulation inhibits IL-2 production and proliferation in activated CD4+ T cells. In contrast, using Runx1-deficient cells prepared from targeted mice, we show that the absence of Runx1 in unstimulated CD4+ T cells results in IL-2 derepression. In summary, we propose that high levels of Runx1 in resting CD4+ T cells functions negatively in the regulation of IL-2 transcription, and that TCR activation-mediated down-regulation of Runx1 involves negative auto-regulation of the distal Runx1 promoter and contributes to IL-2 production."
https://openalex.org/W2035945493,"Notch is a critical mediator of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) during cardiac cushion development. Slug, a transcriptional repressor that is a Notch target, is an important Notch effector of EndMT in the cardiac cushion. Here, we report that the runt-related transcription factor RUNX3 is a novel direct Notch target in the endothelium. Ectopic expression of RUNX3 in endothelium induces Slug expression and EndMT independent of Notch activation. Interestingly, RUNX3 physically interacts with CSL, the Notch-interacting partner in the nucleus, and induces Slug in a CSL-dependent, but Notch-independent manner. Although RUNX3 may not be required for the initial induction of Slug and EndMT by Notch, because RUNX3 has a much longer half-life than Slug, it sustains the expression of Slug thereby maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype. CSL binds to the Runx3 promoter in the atrioventricular canal in vivo, and inhibition of Notch reduces RUNX3 expression in the cardiac cushion of embryonic hearts. Taken together, our results suggest that induction of RUNX3 may be a mechanism to maintain Notch-transformed mesenchymal cells during heart development."
https://openalex.org/W2122317516,"Tau is a multiply phosphorylated protein that is essential for the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Errors in Tau action are associated with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. A huge literature has led to the widely held notion that aberrant Tau hyperphosphorylation is central to these disorders. Unfortunately, our mechanistic understanding of the functional effects of combinatorial Tau phosphorylation remains minimal. Here, we generated four singly pseudophosphorylated Tau proteins (at Thr(231), Ser(262), Ser(396), and Ser(404)) and four doubly pseudophosphorylated Tau proteins using the same sites. Each Tau preparation was assayed for its abilities to promote microtubule assembly and to regulate microtubule dynamic instability in vitro. All four singly pseudophosphorylated Tau proteins exhibited loss-of-function effects. In marked contrast to the expectation that doubly pseudophosphorylated Tau would be less functional than either of its corresponding singly pseudophosphorylated forms, all of the doubly pseudophosphorylated Tau proteins possessed enhanced microtubule assembly activity and were more potent at regulating dynamic instability than their compromised singly pseudophosphorylated counterparts. Thus, the effects of multiple pseudophosphorylations were not simply the sum of the effects of the constituent single pseudophosphorylations; rather, they were generally opposite to the effects of singly pseudophosphorylated Tau. Further, despite being pseudophosphorylated at different sites, the four singly pseduophosphorylated Tau proteins often functioned similarly, as did the four doubly pseudophosphorylated proteins. These data lead us to reassess the conventional view of combinatorial phosphorylation in normal and pathological Tau action. They may also be relevant to the issue of combinatorial phosphorylation as a general regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1974698584,"The enzymatic transfer of the sugar mannose from activated sugar donors is central to the synthesis of a wide range of biologically significant polysaccharides and glycoconjugates. In addition to their importance in cellular biology, mannosyltransferases also provide model systems with which to study catalytic mechanisms of glycosyl transfer. Mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) catalyzes the synthesis of α-mannosyl-d-glycerate using GDP-mannose as the preferred donor species, a reaction that occurs with a net retention of anomeric configuration. Past work has shown that the Rhodothermus marinus MGS, classified as a GT78 glycosyltransferase, displays a GT-A fold and performs catalysis in a metal ion-dependent manner. MGS shows very unusual metal ion dependences with Mg2+ and Ca2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+, thus facilitating catalysis. Here, we probe these dependences through kinetic and calorimetric analyses of wild-type and site-directed variants of the enzyme. Mutation of residues that interact with the guanine base of GDP are correlated with a higher kcat value, whereas substitution of His-217, a key component of the metal coordination site, results in a change in metal specificity to Mn2+. Structural analyses of MGS complexes not only provide insight into metal coordination but also how lactate can function as an alternative acceptor to glycerate.

Mannose-containing oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates are ubiquitous across nature. The sugar is present in N-linked glycans and glycolipids, whereas mannose-containing polysaccharides represent key features of plant, fungal, and bacterial cell walls. In higher organisms, glycan decorations on glycoproteins have the potential to modulate many integral cellular processes, including protein trafficking, cell signaling, immune modulation, and host-pathogen recognition (1Ohtsubo K.

To survive in the harsh conditions of their environments, extremophiles attach mannose to small negatively charged molecules such as glyceramide, glycerate, lactate, and phosphoglycerate, forming molecules which confer tolerance to osmotic stress and thermostability (3Martins L.O.

These tolerance-conferring osmolytes function through balancing the ionic strength across membranes in saline-rich environments, as well as stabilizing proteins by reducing backbone motions, resulting in overall protein rigidification and melting temperature elevation (4Borges N.

Of these stabilizers, 2-O-α-d-mannosylglycerate appears to be both a potent and highly prevalent osmolyte in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic eubacteria and archaea (3Martins L.O. Empadinhas N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35407-35414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 2-O-α-d-Mannosylglycerate synthesis is catalyzed by a GDP-mannose-dependent GT, termed mannosyl-glycerate synthase (MGS), an enzyme that is central to the studies reported here. Based on sequence similarities, GTs have been grouped into approximately 90 families in the carbohydrate-active enzyme database (6Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 7Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4063) Google Scholar), roughly 19 of which contain members that transfer mannosyl groups, although other donor substrate specificities are evident in many of these families. In the majority of these families, the donor substrate is GDPMan (2, 4, 15, 26, 32, 33, 55, 62, 69, 71, 78, 81, 91), although in GT families 22, 39, 50, 58, 76, and 87, the mannosyl residue is transferred from an activated phospholipid to its donor molecule. Surprisingly, given the sequence diversity represented across GT families, predominantly only two structural folds are adopted by nucleotide sugar-dependent GTs; termed GT-A and GT-B (6Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 8Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A third fold class, GT-C, has recently been proposed for the transmembrane-spanning GT family 66, which utilize lipid phosphate-activated sugars as the donor substrate (9Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Maita N. Nyirenda J. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4941-4950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The majority of GT-A-type enzymes employ divalent cations to assist catalysis, whereas GT-B classified enzymes utilize positively charged side chains and/or hydroxyls and helix dipoles (reviewed in Ref. 11Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The presence of the metal in the catalytic cycle is therefore pivotal to the major distinction between the GTs; yet the variation of this metal and the implications for its role have been explored little. The overall architecture of both GT-A and GT-B fold types is similar in that each consists of a pair of β/α/β Rossmann-like domains. In the GT-A fold, the Rossmann-like domains are tightly associated, forming a centrally extended β-sheet architecture whose loops change conformation upon ligand binding, whereas in GT-Bs, the two domains are more loosely associated “facing” each other and often moving as whole domains in response to ligand binding (11Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, GTs may also be divided into whether the reaction leads to net retention or inversion of the stereochemistry of the anomeric carbon of the donor. Representatives of both inverting and retaining GTs exist in both fold families. Analogous to the mechanism of inverting glycoside hydrolases, inverting GTs most likely follow a single SN2-like displacement mechanism where the acceptor molecule, which is activated generally be a catalytic base, acts as a nucleophile, attacking the sugar donor at the anomeric carbon (reviewed in Ref. 11Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanistic details of retaining GTs are far less clear, although it has been proposed that these enzymes catalyze glycosidic bond formation through an SNi-like reaction of asynchronous “front face” departure and attack, which is mechanistically analogous to the well known reaction of alkyl chlorosulfites (Ref. 12Lewis E.S. Boozer C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 308-311Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar and recently discussed in a GT context in Refs. 11Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev.

The continuing catalytic ambiguity of retaining GT highlights that, despite the importance of glycosyl transfer in nature and its potential for commercial application, there is a paucity of structural and mechanistic information on these enzymes. The crystal structures have been reported for three mannosyltransferases that produce the protective osmolytes 2-O-α-d-mannosylglycerate (family 78) or mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate (family 55 and 81) (14Flint J.

The GT family 78 mannosyltransferase, MGS, is expressed by the hyperthermophilic bacterium Rhodothermus marinus. MGS adopts a GT-A fold and catalyzes glycosidic bond formation with retention of anomeric configuration of the transferred α-mannosyl moiety (Fig. 1a) (14Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Employing a high throughput substrate screening strategy, MGS was shown to utilize GDP-α-mannose (and other GDP-sugars) as a donor substrate in a reaction in which the mannose is transferred not only to the C2-OH group of d-glycerate but also d-lactate or glycolate. Kinetically, MGS was shown to employ various divalent cations, with Mg2+ and Ca2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+, facilitating catalysis. Here, we have used structural and biochemical approaches to probe the unusual variation in metal ion specificity displayed by MGS, as well as its donor recognition and acceptor substrate plasticity. The data revealed the structural features that determine the relative preferences for acceptor substrates, provided evidence for GDP interaction while also shedding light on the functional significance of His-217 in the selection of catalytic metal ions by the enzyme. 2-O-α-d-Mannosylglycerate for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and product inhibition studies was synthesized and purified as described in the supplemental methods of Ref. 14Flint J.

Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutants for kinetic studies were constructed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pJF1 as template and primers listed in supplemental Table S1. MGS with a 15 residue, C-terminal, truncation was used for crystallization complexes with lactate. A variant protein was used for crystallization of other complexes (see under “Crystallization Data Collection and Structural Determination”). MGS wild-type and mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (14Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli (strain Tuner) transformed with appropriate plasmid was grown to an optical density, at 550 nm, of ∼0.6 in 1 liter of LB media with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and then incubated at 16 °C before induction of MGS expression with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell-free extracts were heat-treated at 65 °C for 20 min, and MGS was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Proteins for kinetic studies were sufficiently pure after immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography purification. When analyzing the influence of metals on enzyme function, MGS was treated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) to unwanted metals. For crystallography, MGS was further purified by anion exchange. Large three-dimensional crystals of MGS-Tr readily develop in an array of crystallization conditions. However, the maximum resolution obtained during diffraction experiments of complex structures was of moderate quality (2.45–2.95 Å) (14Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E.

In an attempt to ameliorate MGS-Tr surface properties for crystallization, MGS-Tr was analyzed with SERp (17Goldschmidt L. Cooper D.R. Derewenda Z.S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) to suggest segments of residues that make substantial surface entropy contributions. SERp highlighted three putative clusters at positions Glu-89/Glu-90, Glu-115/Glu-116, and Gln-253/Glu-254. An additional site was selected at Gln-201/Gln-202 through manual structural inspection (Fig. 1b). Each cluster was evaluated for solvent exposure and contribution to intra- and intermolecular contacts using known MGS-Tr structures. Based on this analysis, E89A/E90A and Q201A/Q202A MGS-Tr mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of which only the Q201A/Q202A MGS surface variant expressed to an appreciable amount. Recombinant MGS-Tr-Q201A/Q202A surface variant (MGS-Sv) was expressed and purified as described previously for MGS-Tr (14Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the exception that MGS-Sv was buffer exchanged into 25 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, prior to crystallization. MGS-Sv crystals developed after ∼3 days in hanging drop setup at 19 °C in equal volumes of protein (15 mg/ml) and reservoir solution consisting of 4% (v/v) ethylene glycol, Bistris propane, pH 5.5, supplemented with either magnesium formate, manganese formate, or sodium malonate between 0.2 and 0.5 m, where appropriate. MGS-lactate crystals were grown in 0.3 m sodium d-lactate, 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.6, 40% (v/v) 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, which acted as a cryoprotectant. GDP and GDPMan complexed crystals were obtained by soaking apo-crystals in mother liquor supplemented with 10 mm ligand for ∼10 min and subsequently cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 35% (v/v) ethylene glycol. MGS-Tr diffraction data were collected at beamlines ID-29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (lactate and Mg2+ + GDP), IO3 of Diamond Light Source (Mn2+ + GDP), and the York Structural Biology Laboratory home source (Mg2+ + GDPMan). In each case, MGS crystals were evaluated to belong to the space group P3221 and to contain two MGS molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data were processed with either the HKL2000 suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38444) Google Scholar) or iMOSFLM/Scala (19Leslie A.G.

Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Ligands were subsequently incorporated followed by cycles of maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23002) Google Scholar). Overall, the surface entropy minimization of the MGS-Tr Q201A/Q202A mutant together with the identification of novel crystallization conditions resulted in a slight improvement to diffraction. Other computing used the CCP4 suite (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Briefly, a calibration curve for mannosylglycerate was constructed by measuring the ratios of the total ion count of mannosylglycerate at varying concentrations (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 μm) to the total ion count of pseudo-internal standard UDP (100 μm) in 1 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8. Enzyme-catalyzed reactions were performed in 1 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, at 37 °C, using final concentrations of 100 μm GDPMan, 100 μm d-glycerate, 50 μm Ca2+, and 1 μm enzyme. Initial rates were determined from mannosylglycerate concentrations calculated every 30 min over 480 min from total ion count measurements of a 10-μl aliquot mixed with 10 μl of UDP (100 μm). Initial rates determined by MS methods were within error of those determined by linked methods thus eliminating the possibility of artifacts from the latter. Initial rates were also determined using indirect detection of GDP by coupling the release of GDP to NADH oxidation via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase developed from Ref. 26Gosselin S. Alhussaini M. Streiff M.B. Takabayashi K. Palcic M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar. Assays were performed in final concentrations as follows: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 0.15 mm NADH, 0.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate potassium salt, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 30 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (both Sigma, rabbit muscle-type II, ammonium sulfate suspension) with 75–500 nm enzyme at 23 °C. NADH oxidation was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Either 2 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm MnCl2 was added to each assay to test the effect of the metal ion. For each variant of MGS assayed, the reaction was carried out in the absence of acceptor and showed no GDP release. These experiments confirmed that there was no enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of the donor substrate. For pseudo-single substrate kinetics, the fixed substrate concentration used was >3 times the Km value. kcat and Km values were calculated by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the initial rates (GraphPad Prism version 4.03, GraphPad Software, San Diego). Bi-substrate kinetics used concentrations of each substrate corresponding to ½, 1, 2, 4, and 10 times the Km value determined in the pseudo-single substrate kinetics. Data were analyzed for a general bi-substrate system using Equation 1, v=vmax[A][B]KiaKB+KB[A]+KA[B]+[A][B](Eq. 1) KA and KB are the limiting Michaelis constant for acceptor (A) and donor (B), respectively, when the other substrate is saturating. Ki,a and Ki,b are the dissociation constants between enzyme and acceptor or donor respectively. KA, KB, Ki,a, and Ki,b values were calculated as described previously (27Seto N.O. Palcic M.M.

The metal ion dependences of MGS WT and the H217A variant were determined by adding 0.001–0.5 μm enzyme at 37 °C to (final concentration) 100 μm d-glycerate and 500 μm GDP-mannose in 13 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) BSA with 3 mm of either CaCl2, CoCl2, MnCl2, or NiCl2. Aliquots were mixed with EDTA (final concentration 10 mm) to stop the reaction. Product inhibition reactions were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 0.1 μm enzyme at 23 °C. The concentration of d-glycerate was fixed at 500 μm, whereas the concentration of GDPMan covered a range from 50 to 4000 μm. GDP was added to give a final concentration of 10–100 μm. Aliquots were mixed with the same volume of 10 mm EDTA as a metal chelator to inactivate MGS. The release of GDP was determined by HPLC (Gemini C18, 5 μm, 250 × 4.60 mm column (Phenomenex), Dionex ICS-3000 HPLC, 100-μl aliquots) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 2% (v/v) acetonitrile). GDP and GDPMan were eluted using a linear gradient (0–20% of buffer B (100% (v/v) acetonitrile)) and monitored by UV detection (260 nm) at 25 °C (Dionex AD20 absorbance detector). ITC measurements were performed on a VP-ITC microcalorimeter from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA). All titrations were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The concentrations of ligand (GDPMan, d-glycerate (calcium salt), GDP, and mannosylglycerate) used were 0.5–1 mm and MGS wild-type and H217A mutant in the reaction cell were at 40–55 μm. All protein was dialyzed in Chelex-treated buffer, and stock solutions of GDP, CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2 were prepared in the same dialysis buffer. Background titrations with GDP or GDPMan into buffer were subtracted from the raw data of titrations of MGS with GDP or GDPMan, respectively. The determined KA and ΔH were used to derive ΔS from standard thermodynamic equations. The general structure of MGS is composed of a mixed α/β, GT-A fold catalytic domain (residues 2–262) and a six-helix C-terminal domain (residues 263–381) thought to be important for oligomerization (MGS is a tetramer) (Fig. 1b) (14Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In previous work, we provided a preliminary indication that perhaps the active center coordination of the nucleotide portion of the sugar donor species was as important as the nature of the donor sugar itself (14Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we have probed the donor and acceptor subsites, primarily through kinetic analysis of enzyme variants. In the previous report on the crystal structure of MGS, there were several crystal forms, some of which had many molecules in the asymmetric unit. In this study, we have used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and modifications to the original crystallization conditions to generate crystals of MGS in the space group P3221 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 1), which was associated with a high solvent content (∼75%). The description of the crystal structures of MGS in complex with various ligands is based partly on data described previously by Flint et al. (14Flint J. Taylor E. Yang M. Bolam D.N. Tailford L.E. Martinez-Fleites C. Dodson E.J. Davis B.G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (GDPMan-Mn2+, GDP-Mn2+, and Mn2+-glycerate) and also new complexes (GDPMan-Mg2+, GDP-Mg2+, GDP-Mn2+/malonate, and lactate) that are reported here. Together, these survey structures in which both hard and soft metals are bound. The active center is located almost in the protein core, with residues shown to make important donor/acceptor interactions contributed from various interlacing loops of the catalytic domain. Because of the high crystal solvent content (previous crystal structures and new structures reported here), the MGS structures have high molecular mobility. Although this characteristic has the effect of diminishing crystal order and therefore diffraction resolution limits, it does provide an opportunity to characterize some of the highly dynamic regions of MGS. B-factor analysis suggests residues in regions 1–66, 100–140, 215–222, and 250–270 have high mean atomic displacements. Many of these residues are located in the active center. Interestingly, these regions remain flexible even when MGS is in complex with donor or acceptor substrates and products, suggesting that protein flexibility is important for all stages along the reaction coordinate. The MGS structure(s) revealed that the guanine base of GDP is housed in a hydrophobic pocket between the side chains of Lys-9 and Tyr-37 on one face and the aliphatic portion of the side chain of Lys-76 on the opposing face, with Gln-66 accepting hydrogen bonds from the endocyclic N1 and exocyclic N2 (Fig. 1, c and d). To explore the functional significance of guanine recognition, the properties of the alanine mutants K76A, Y37A, K9A, and Q66A were evaluated (Table 2). Determination of kinetic parameters in the presence of excess co-substrate revealed that mutation of Lys-76 to alanine resulted in ∼3–4-fold increase in kcat coupled with an elevation in Km for d-glycerate and GDPMan of 15- and 3-fold, respectively. Similarly, the Y37A and K9A mutations also caused a significant increase in kcat (4–10-fold) in the presence of saturating co-substrate. Notably, the two mutations had little effect on the Km value for GDPMan. The Km value toward the acceptor substrate glycerate for the K9A mutant was also little affected, whereas the Y37A mutant showed an 8-fold increase in the Km value compared with wild-type MGS (Table 2). As a consequence, K9A has a catalytic ef"

The biochemical cause is unclear. We previously ascribed this cancer-specific overexpression to an element, Canscript, residing around 50 bp 5' of the transcription start site in cancer (Hucl, T., Brody, J. R., Gallmeier, E., Iacobuzio-Donahue, C. A., Farrance, I. K., and Kern, S. E. (2007) Cancer Res. 67, 9055-9065). Herein, we found a Canscript promoter activity elevated over 100-fold in cancer cells. In addition to a highly conserved TEAD1 (TEA domain family member 1)-binding MCAT motif, nucleotide substitution revealed the consensus core sequence (WCYCCACCC) of an SP1-like motif in Canscript. The unknown transcription factor binding to the SP1-like motif may hold the key for the cancer specificity of Canscript. SP1, GLI1, and RUNX1, -2, and -3 appeared unlikely to be the direct transcription factors acting at the SP1-like motif, but KLF6 had some features of such a candidate. YAP1, a TEAD1-binding protein, appeared necessary, but not sufficient, for Canscript activity; knockdown of YAP1 by small interfering RNAs greatly reduced MSLN levels in MSLN-overexpressing cells, but overexpressing YAP1 in MSLN-negative cells did not induce MSLN expression. Cansript-like sequences were found in other genes up-regulated in pancreatic cancer; reporters driven by the sequences from FXYD3, MUC1, and TIMP1 had activities more than 2 times that of the control. This suggested that the cause of MSLN overexpression might also contribute mechanistically to the overexpression of other tumor markers."

Limited access to diseased tissue, the presence of multiple unresolvable actin isoforms in the cell, and lack of an animal model have prevented analysis of the biochemical mechanisms underlying this pathology. We have utilized actin from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 86% identical to human α-smooth muscle actin, as a model. Two of the known human mutations, N115T and R116Q, were engineered into yeast actin, and their effect on actin function in vivo and in vitro was investigated. Both mutants exhibited reduced ability to grow under a variety of stress conditions, which hampered N115T cells more than R116Q cells. Both strains exhibited abnormal mitochondrial morphology indicative of a faulty actin cytoskeleton. In vitro, the mutant actins exhibited altered thermostability and nucleotide exchange rates, indicating effects of the mutations on monomer conformation, with R116Q the most severely affected. N115T demonstrated a biphasic elongation phase during polymerization, whereas R116Q demonstrated a markedly extended nucleation phase. Allele-specific effects were also seen on critical concentration, rate of depolymerization, and filament treadmilling. R116Q filaments were hypersensitive to severing by the actin-binding protein cofilin. In contrast, N115T filaments were hyposensitive to cofilin despite nearly normal binding affinities of actin for cofilin.

IntroductionAneurysm and dissection of the thoracic aorta is a major cause of mortality, accounting for 0.5–1% of deaths annually in the United States, and the incidence is increasing, affecting 9–16 in 100,000 individuals/year (1Olsson C.

Aortic aneurysms can occur in the absence of systemic findings of a connective tissue disorder, complicating diagnosis (3Hiratzka L.F. Bakris G.L. Beckman J.A. Bersin R.M. Carr V.F. Casey Jr., D.E.

Interestingly, mutations in ACTA2 are associated with an array of cardiovascular diseases from congenital to premature acquired heart disease.

Mutations in the actin family have recently been associated with disease, the vast majority of which behave in a dominant fashion. Over the past decade, mutations in α-cardiac (ACTC), α-skeletal (ACTA1), and γ-cytoplasmic actin (ACTG1) have been associated with cardiomyopathies, skeletal myopathies, and deafness, respectively. As such, the role for the α-SM actin in human disease is not surprising.In vascular smooth muscle cells, α-SM actin has many roles, including maintenance of cell wall integrity, force transduction, and regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (9Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). α-SM actin is the most abundant protein in vascular smooth muscle cells, making up 40% of total cellular protein and over 70% of the total actin (10Fatigati V.

Histopathology from individuals with α-SM actin mutations noted loss or disorganization of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of the aorta (8Guo D.C. Papke C.L. Tran-Fadulu V.

Analysis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells showed diminished α-SM actin, with substantially fewer polymerized actin fibers that did not extend completely across the cell body. α-SM actin staining did not co-localize with polymerized actin fibers and was found clumped along the cell wall or nuclear wall.To gain insight into how ACTA2 mutations cause disease, the functional changes in the context of the structure of the actin molecule must be established. The actin monomer can be divided into two large domains. An adenine nucleotide binds between the two halves, bridging the cleft to impart stability to the protein, and plays a major role in controlling protein dynamics. Each of the domains can each be further divided into two subdomains, as shown in Fig. 1. Actin polymerizes to form a polar filament with what is termed a barbed and a pointed end. The barbed end is the preferred site for monomer addition during filament elongation and, as such, is where much of actin assembly regulation occurs. The asymmetry can be imparted to the actin monomer as well. Subdomains 1 and 3 constitute the monomer barbed end, whereas subdomains 2 and 4 make up the pointed end.At least 22 autosomal dominant missense mutations in α-SM actin have now been identified in familial TAAD, and they are distributed across all four subdomains (7Guo D.C.

The focus of this paper is on two of these mutations, N117T and R118Q, which are adjacent to one another in a secondary structural element, near the barbed end of the protein. The location is predicted to be involved in intermonomer interactions, as shown in Fig. 1. Of interest, the two mutations have different clinical phenotypes. The N117T mutation has been found in both α-skeletal muscle and α-SM actins and is associated primarily with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta (7Guo D.C. Pannu H. Tran-Fadulu V. Papke C.L. Yu R.K.

R118Q is the second most common mutation identified in α-SM actin, and remarkably, 75% of patients with this mutation have premature coronary artery disease in addition to aortic aneurysms. The varied clinical phenotypes suggest that although all 22 of these mutations cause TAAD, the molecular mechanisms by which different mutations lead to aortic disease are allele-specific.Understanding of the effects of α-SM actin mutations at the molecular level in the context of the aortic wall is hampered by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient samples from patients for biochemical studies. Even if one were to introduce the mutations into model animals to establish cultured vascular smooth muscle cell preparations, the amount of material available for biochemical analysis would be limited. Additionally, the presence of three essentially unresolvable isoforms of actin in the vascular smooth muscle cells would hinder direct assessment of the effects of the mutations on α-SM actin function.An attractive model system for studying the effects of actin mutations is the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast actin is 86% identical and 94% similar to α-SM actin and is encoded by a single essential gene, ACT1 (15Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). More importantly, the two residues at which the TAAD mutations occur in α-SM actin are identical in yeast actin (N117T and R118Q in α-SM actin correspond to N115T and R116Q in yeast actin, and for the remainder of this work, the yeast numbering system will be used). In addition, actin regulation is well conserved between species. Many of the actin-binding proteins in mammalian cells are also found in yeast (16Drubin D.G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Bretscher A. Drees B. Harsay E. Schott D. Wang T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and yeast actin will interact with many of the mammalian isoforms of actin-binding proteins due to the high degree of homology between actins (18Chen W. Wen K.K. Sens A.E. Rubenstein P.A. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24168-24174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutations can be readily introduced into the actin gene by site-directed mutagenesis to express mutant actin as the sole actin isoform. The impact of mutations on actin function in the cell can be assessed cytologically, and the actin can be purified for studies of the biochemical effects of the mutations on the molecule. The in vivo and in vitro data can be analyzed for alterations in molecular behavior to provide insight into the mechanisms underlying aortic disease. We have previously applied this approach to the analysis of mutations in γ-nonmuscle actin that cause autosomal dominant early onset deafness (20Bryan K.E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18260-18269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Bryan K.E. Wen K.K. Zhu M. Rendtorff N.D. Feldkamp M. Tranebjaerg L. Friderici K.H. Rubenstein P.A.

The effects of the TAAD mutations on cell behavior and actin-related cellular functions were characterized. Actin was purified, and the impact of the mutations on actin monomer and polymer function in vitro was assessed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington. DE52 DEAE-cellulose was obtained from Whatman. Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Tris columns and Affi-Gel 10-activated resin were purchased from Bio-Rad. ATP was purchased from Sigma. ϵ-ATP, rhodamine-phalloidin, FM4-64, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Molecular Probes. The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene, and oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Yeast cakes for wild type actin preparations were purchased from a local bakery. All other chemicals were of reagent grade quality.Construction of Mutant Yeast StrainsMutations were introduced into the centromeric plasmid pRS314 (21Bryan K.E. Wen K.K. Zhu M. Rendtorff N.D.

Plasmids containing the desired mutations were introduced into a recipient yeast strain containing a deleted chromosomal ACT1 gene and a plasmid expressing wild type actin (pCENWT) as described previously (23Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffling yielded viable haploid strains for each of the mutations. The plasmids containing the mutant constructs were reisolated from these strains and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation.Growth Behavior in Liquid CultureCells were grown in complete liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) at 30 °C on a shaking platform. Growth was determined by diluting an overnight culture of each strain into fresh medium at an initial A600 of 0.1 and following growth at 30 °C with agitation. The absorbances of the cultures were recorded as a function of time. The absorbances were back-calculated following the appropriate dilutions to lower the cell density to the linear range of the spectrometer.Growth under Stress ConditionsTemperature sensitivity of mutant actin was examined by plating four serial 10-fold dilutions of the cultures on YPD plates followed by incubation at 24, 30, or 37 °C. Colony size was assessed as a function of time. To assess mitochondrial function, cells were grown on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. Cultures were plated on YPG medium (YPD medium with the dextrose replaced with 2% glycerol) and incubated at 30 °C. To test for hyperosmolar sensitivity, cells were plated on YPD plus 0.9 m NaCl agar plates and incubated at 30 °C.CytologyCell structures were imaged with an Olympus IX81 microscope and a Hamamatsu (model C10600-10B-H) camera. Camera control and image enhancement were performed using MetaMorph version 4.5 software (Universal Image Corp., Downingtown, PA). Presentation of cell images was done using CorelDRAW 11. All cellular statistical analysis was based on cell counts of >100 for each sample. To measure cell size, mounted samples were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy. The long axis of the cell was measured using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).Mitochondria were visualized in living cells by expressing a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein (GFP) conjugated to the mitochondrial signal sequence of citrate synthase kindly provided by Dr. Liza A. Pon (24Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the plasmid were grown to an A600 of 0.3–0.5 in Ura− synthetic medium to force retention of the URA3-marked plasmid in the otherwise Ura3− cells. An aliquot of cells was resuspended in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and the cells were then observed by fluorescence microscopy as described above. Z-sections through the cell were obtained at 0.15-μm intervals. Out-of-focus light was removed by deconvolution using MetaMorph software, and each series of deconvolved images was further rendered with ImageJ.The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by fluorescence microscopy after staining fixed cells with rhodamine-phalloidin as described previously (25McKane M.

Cytoskeletal analysis focused on budding cells when the daughter cell is less than one-half the size of the mother cell. Vacuoles were imaged following exposure of the cells to the dye FM4-64 as described previously (26Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA was stained with DAPI as described previously (25McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Latrunculin A SensitivitySterile filtered discs (0.5 cm in diameter) were presoaked in 2 μl of DMSO (control) plus 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mm of latrunculin A (9Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Soaked discs were placed on YPD plates containing 100 μl of evenly spread wild type or mutant cells (A600 = 0.1). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h, and the zone of growth inhibition around the drug eluting latrunculin A disc was assessed.ΔAip1p Deletion Strain StudiesUsing an Δaip1:pCENWT strain as the host (26Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), pRS314 plasmids containing the promoter region, the TRP1 gene, and the coding sequence for wild type or mutant yeast actin were transformed into this haploid yeast strain (27Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on tryptophan-deficient medium and then subjected to plasmid shuffling to eliminate the wild type actin gene. Growth curves, growth characteristics, and cytology were determined as described above for wild type and each mutant in the ΔAip1p deletion strain.Protein PurificationWild type and mutant yeast actins were purified from lysates of frozen yeast cells using a combination of DNase I-agarose affinity chromatography, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and polymerization/depolymerization cycling as described previously (27Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quality of actin preparations was assessed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. The concentration of G-actin was determined from the absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 m−1 cm−1. Actin was stored as G-actin in G buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm ATP, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). All actins were stored at 4 °C and used within 4 days of purification. Yeast cofilin was purified from Escherichia coli carrying a recombinant construct for the protein according to Lappalainen et al. (20Bryan K.E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18260-18269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and the concentration of the purified cofilin was determined by absorption at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 14,650 m−1 cm−1.Actin PolymerizationPolymerization of 4.8 μm G-actin in a total volume of 120 μl was induced by the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm, respectively (F-salts). Polymerization at 25 °C was monitored by following the increase in light scattering of the sample in a FluoroMax-3 fluorescence spectrometer outfitted with a computer-controlled thermostatted four-position multisample exchanger (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.). The excitation and emission wavelengths were both set to 360 nm with the slit widths set at 1 nm. To determine the effects of cofilin on preformed actin filaments, the desired amount of cofilin was added to the polymerized actin sample, and the resulting change in light scattering was monitored. For experiments examining the effects of different molar fractions of mutant actin on overall actin behavior, wild type and mutant actin were combined with a final total actin concentration of 4.8 μm before induction of polymerization. All polymerization experiments were performed at least three times with at least three different actin preparations.Actin Depolymerization RatesActin was polymerized to steady-state levels followed by the addition of DNase I in a 1:1 actin/DNase molar ratio. Depolymerization was monitored as a decrease in light scattering over time. Depolymerization rates were determined by fitting the data to a single exponential expression using BioKine version 3.1.Circular Dichroism MeasurementsThe apparent melting temperatures of wild type and mutant actins were determined using circular dichroism by following the change in ellipticity of the G-actin sample at 222 nm as a function of temperature between 25 and 90 °C as described previously (21Bryan K.E. Wen K.K. Zhu M. Rendtorff N.D. Feldkamp M. Tranebjaerg L. Friderici K.H. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20129-20139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Measurements were made on an Aviv 62 DS spectropolarimeter. Data were fit to a two-state model, and the apparent Tm value was determined by fitting the data to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to approximate the temperature at which 50% of the actin was denatured.ϵ-ATP ExchangeThe ability of G-actin to exchange bound nucleotide was assessed by first loading the actin with ϵ-ATP and quantifying the rate of displacement from actin in the presence of a large excess of ATP as described previously (21Bryan K.E. Wen K.K. Zhu M. Rendtorff N.D. Feldkamp M. Tranebjaerg L. Friderici K.H. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20129-20139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Exchange rates were determined by fitting the data to a single exponential expression using BioKine version 3.1.Cofilin Binding AssayG-actinPyrene-labeled G-actin was made according to Feng et al.

Increasing amounts of cofilin were added to a 1.5-ml sample containing 1 μm 100% pyrene-labeled G-actin, and the cofilin-dependent increase in pyrene fluorescence was recorded on a FluoroLog3 fluorescence spectrometer outfitted with a computer-controlled thermostatted sample exchanger with continuous sample mixing (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.). All experiments were performed in G-buffer containing 50 mm KCl. Note that this concentration of KCl will not induce polymerization of yeast actin because polymerization of yeast actin requires Mg2+, unlike muscle actin (30Kim E. Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16566-16572Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 344 and 386 nm, respectively, with the corresponding slit widths of 1 and 2 nm. Using Microsoft Excel, experimental data were fit to the quadratic binding isotherm, ΔF=Fmax[A]+[C]+Kd−([A]+[C]+Kd)2−4[A][C]2[A](Eq. 1) where ΔF represents the observed fluorescence change of the actin-cofilin complex after the fluorescence of the G-actin alone has been subtracted; Fmax is the maximum fluorescence change at complete saturation of actin with cofilin; [A] and [C] are the concentrations of G-actin and cofilin, respectively; and Kd is the observed dissociation constant. The solver function was used to minimize the difference between the experimental data and the best fit to produce the Kd.F-actinPyrene-labeled G-actin was made according to Feng et al. (29Feng L.

Polymerization of 4.8 μm G-actin (10% pyrene-labeled and 90% unlabeled) in a total volume of 120 μl was induced by the addition of F-salts. The change in actin-pyrene fluorescence due to actin polymerization was recorded with a FluoroLog3 fluorescence spectrometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex). The excitation wavelength was 365 nm. The change in fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength 386 nm was recorded over time for kinetics analyses. After steady state was reached, an increasing amount of cofilin was added to the sample, and the cofilin-dependent quenching of the pyrene fluorescence was recorded. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 344 and 386 nm, respectively, with the corresponding slit widths of 1 and 2 nm. Using Microsoft Excel, experimental data were fit to the quadratic binding isotherm (as above).Critical Concentration DeterminationTo measure the critical concentration (Cc) of each actin, the net change in light scattering of an actin polymerization reaction was measured as a function of increasing actin concentration. Polymerization of G-actin, at concentrations between 4.8 and 1 μm, was induced by the addition of F-salts and monitored by light scattering. The final increase in light scattering for each actin concentration was reco"

Here we present crystal structures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AnmK in complex with its natural substrate, anhMurNAc, and a product of the reaction, ADP. AnmK is homodimeric, with each subunit comprised of two subdomains that are separated by a deep active site cleft, which bears similarity to the ATPase core of proteins belonging to the hexokinase-hsp70-actin superfamily of proteins. The conversion of anhMurNAc to MurNAc-6-P involves both cleavage of the 1,6-anhydro ring of anhMurNAc along with addition of a phosphoryl group to O6 of the sugar, and thus represents an unusual enzymatic mechanism involving the formal addition of H3PO4 to anhMurNAc. The structural complexes and NMR analysis of the reaction suggest that a water molecule, activated by Asp-182, attacks the anomeric carbon of anhMurNAc, aiding cleavage of the 1,6-anhydro bond and facilitating the capture of the γ phosphate of ATP by O6 via an in-line phosphoryl transfer. AnmK is active only against anhMurNAc and not the metabolically related 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl peptides, suggesting that the cytosolic N-acetyl-anhydromuramyl-l-alanine amidase AmpD must first remove the stem peptide from these PG muropeptide catabolites before anhMurNAc can be acted upon by AnmK.

Here, we examined the structure and function of the TraI helicase. We show that TraI binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a site size of ∼25 nucleotides, which is significantly longer than the site size of other known superfamily I helicases. Low cooperativity was observed with the binding of TraI to ssDNA, and a double-stranded DNA-binding site was identified within the N-terminal region of TraI 1–858, outside the core helicase motifs of TraI. We have revealed that the affinity of TraI for DNA is negatively correlated with the ionic strength of the solution. The binding of AMPPNP or ADP results in a 3-fold increase in the affinity of TraI for ssDNA. Moreover, TraI prefers to bind ssDNA oligomers containing a single type of base. Finally, we elucidated the solution structure of TraI using small angle x-ray scattering. TraI exhibits an ellipsoidal shape in solution with four domains aligning along one axis.

Conjugative plasmid transfer is a central mechanism for the horizontal exchange of genetic material between bacterial cells, as well as for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors (1Brochet M. Rusniok C. Couvé E. Dramsi S. Poyart C. Trieu-Cuot P. Kunst F. Glaser P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15961-15966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2de la Cruz F. Frost L.S.

Microbiol. 2005; 3: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Conjugative plasmid transfer requires both a DNA relaxase and a DNA helicase. The relaxase initiates DNA transfer by cleaving the transferred strand at a specific site within the oriT, forming a 5′-phosphotyrosine intermediate. Following nicking, the helicase uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind the plasmid and drive the transfer of DNA into the recipient cell. The relaxase completes plasmid transfer by breaking the covalent phosphotyrosine linkage and releasing the transferred DNA for replication in the recipient (2de la Cruz F. Frost L.S. Meyer R.J.

TraI contains three major functional domains, including the N-terminal relaxase domain (residues 1–309), a central helicase domain (residues 310 to 1476), and a C-terminal domain (CTD, 4The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MCT, macromolecule competition titration; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. residues 1477–1756) that is responsible for interactions with TraY and TraM (Fig. 1) (8Byrd D.R.

The region between residues 310 and 950 is not fully characterized, although it has been proposed to share a helicase-like fold (see below). The covalent linkage between these functional domains is required for efficient conjugation (12Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol.

Unlike other helicases, the processivity of TraI helicase requires neither oligomerization nor the presence of a processivity factor. The underlying mechanism of the processivity of TraI has remained unclear (14Sikora B. Eoff R.L. Matson S.W. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36110-36116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the interaction of TraI with DNA is essential to its helicase activity, little is known about the DNA-binding properties of the TraI helicase. Matson and co-workers (8Byrd D.R. Sampson J.K.

Recent work from Dostal and Schildbach (17Dostál L. Schildbach J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggested that the helicase domain of TraI consists of two RecD-like subdomains (Fig. 1). The C-terminal RecD-like domain (residues 830–1473) contains helicase motifs and is the motor domain, whereas the N-terminal RecD-like domain (residues 303–844) lacks critical helicase motifs and likely specializes in ssDNA binding (17Dostál L. Schildbach J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Numerous fundamental aspects of the interaction of the TraI helicase with DNA, such as the length of DNA bound by TraI, the intrinsic binding affinity, binding cooperativity, dependence of affinity on ionic strength, nucleotide binding, and base specificity, are still unclear. This knowledge is important for the quantitative understanding of the interaction between TraI helicase and DNA, as well as the molecular mechanism and regulation of TraI helicase activity. Here, we used fluorescence anisotropy-based equilibrium binding assays to investigate TraI helicase-associated DNA-binding properties. Our studies have elucidated the intrinsic binding affinity, binding cooperativity, and the lengths of ssDNA and dsDNA bound by TraI. Also, we identified the location on TraI of the dsDNA binding site. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of ionic strength, nucleotide binding, and base composition on the affinity of TraI for DNA. Finally, we examined the spatial organization of TraI domains in solution. Together, these results advance our understanding of the interaction between TraI helicase and DNA, providing insights into the molecular mechanism by which TraI performs its helicase function. DNA oligomers used in this study were purchased from Integrated DNA Technology (IDT, Coralville, IA). Labeled oligomers have the fluorescent probe 6-FAMTM covalently attached to their 5′ end and were purified using HPLC by IDT. Unlabeled oligomers were desalted without further purification. The sequences of DNA oligomers are listed in Table 1. All DNA oligomers were dissolved in oligomer annealing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. To prepare duplex DNA, two complementary DNA oligomers were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, heated to 95 °C, and slowly cooled down to 20 °C with a speed of 1 °C/min in a thermocycler.TABLE 1Sequences of DNA oligomers used in this studyFL-T176FAM-5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′25-mer5′-CACTGACCGTCTGACTGCGATCCGA-3′39-mer5′-TCGGATCGCAGTCAGATGGTAAGAGAGACGCATAGATGC-3′45-mer5′GCGAACTGTCGAGTCGGCATCCGGATCTAGGGTAACCGGTACTGC-3′51-mer5′TCGGATCGCAGTCAGATGGTAAGAGAGACGCATAGATGCTGAGTGAGAGAT-3′63-mer5′TCGGATCGCAGTCAGATGGTAAGAGAGACGCATAGATGCTGAGTGAGAGATGCTCAGGTACAG-3′FL-dsDNA156FAM-5′-TCG GAT CGC AGT CAG-3′dsDNA95′-TCG GAT CGC-3′dsDNA115′-TCG GAT CGC AG-3′dsDNA155′-TCG GAT CGC AGT CAG-3′dsDNA195′-TCG GAT CGC AGT CAG ACG G-3′dsDNA215′-TCG GAT CGC AGT CAG ACG GTC-3′dsDNA235′-TCG GAT CGC AGT CAG ACG GTC AG-3′dsDNA275′-TCG GAT CGC AGT CAG ACG GTC AGT GAC-3′ Open table in a new tab Standard DNA binding buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.1% BSA.

Buffer C contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% BSA. Standard ligation independent cloning techniques, as described by Stols et al. (18Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), were employed in the construction of expression plasmids encoding the segments of TraI used in this study. The amplified DNA fragments were treated and cloned into empty pMCSG7-Lic-MBP expression vector (18Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The His6 maltose-binding protein tag was cleaved off after purification using tobacco etch virus protease. All expression plasmids used in this study were sequence-verified. The expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Gold (Stratagene). Bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking. After the A600 reached 0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and bacteria were grown for another 12 h at 16 °C with shaking. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in loading buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole) supplemented with 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 tablet of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After 1 h of incubation on ice, the resuspended cells were sonicated on ice for 2 min, and the lysate was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore) and then loaded onto a 5-ml high performance HisTrapTM column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with loading buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of loading buffer before bound protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). The eluted protein was pooled and loaded onto a HiPrepTM 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with desalting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Fractions containing protein were collected. Tobacco etch virus protease was added to the pooled protein fractions with a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) tobacco etch virus to TraI. After 16 h of incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was reloaded onto a 5-ml HisTrapTM column equilibrated with loading buffer. The flow-through fractions were collected and concentrated in a Centricon YM30 (Amicon) concentrator. Finally, concentrated protein was loaded on a HiLoadTM 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with sizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol). Protein-containing fractions were concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Purified protein was >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. SAXS data were collected for protein solutions and their matched buffers using the standard SAXS instrument at the beamline 18-ID (Bio-CAT, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). The experiments were carried out at 16 °C using an x-ray photon energy of 12 keV. The Mar165 CCD detector with an active area of ∼160 × 80 mm2 was used for data collection. The sample-to-detector distances were set to 2.3 m to make scattering vectors, q, range from 0.007 to 0.38 Å−1. The scattering vector here is defined as q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. Samples were flowed back and forth during SAXS measurements with a Hamilton programmable syringe pump to minimize radiation damage. Twenty frames of short exposure (2 s) were taken on each sample and averaged to improve the signal/noise ratio. Data were reduced using Bio-CAT SAXS data reduction macros installed in the program Igor (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR). Guinier plots, made using the program Igor, were used for detection of aggregation in protein samples. Guinier approximation I(q) = I(0) exp(−q2Rg2/3) with the limits qRg <1.3 was used to determine the radius of gyration, Rg, and the scattering intensity extrapolated to zero angle I(0). The molecular weight of TraI was determined from I(0) on a relative scale using cytochrome c as a reference. The pair distribution function, P(r), and the maximum dimension of the protein, Dmax, were computed by the program GNOM (19Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2985) Google Scholar). The low resolution shape of TraI was restored from the experimental SAXS profile using the program DAMMIN (20Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The data within the q range of 0.0104 to 0.2129 Å−1 were used for the analysis. Forty individual models were generated by DAMMIN (21VolKov V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). The 20 models with the best χ2 were aligned using SUBCOMB and averaged using DAMMAVER (21VolKov V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). The averaged model was then filtered based on occupancy and volume using DAMFILT to generate the final model of TraI. The volumetric representation of the SAXS model was prepared by SITUS (22Wriggers W. Chacón P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 773-776Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the relaxase domain (residues 1–307) and the C-terminal domain (residues 1476–1628) were obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the accession numbers 1P4D and 3FLD, respectively. Homology models of TraI 309–842 and TraI 846–1473 were constructed by PHYRE (23Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of RecD from E. coli RecBCD complex (PDB accession number 1W36) as a template. The atomic models were placed into the ab initio shape by visual judgment using the program Chimera (24Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28971) Google Scholar). The scattering intensities of the structural model were calculated using CRYSOL (25Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). The goodness of the structural model was assessed by CRYSOL based on the discrepancy (χ2) between the calculated scattering intensities and the experimental scattering intensities. The orientation and position of individual domains in the structural model were manually adjusted to minimize the discrepancy. Fluorescence anisotropy (FA)-based DNA binding assays were employed to study DNA binding by TraI as described by Shildbach and co-workers (26Anderson B.J. Larkin C. Guja K. Schildbach J.F. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 450: 253-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with some modifications. To perform the direct DNA binding assay, a 6FAM-labeled DNA oligomer was mixed with increasing concentrations of protein in DNA binding buffer in 384-well plates (Corning Glass). The fluorescence anisotropy of each well was measured by a Pherastar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany) using the excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. The fluorescence anisotropy (FA) was defined as shown in Equation 1, FA=(IVV−Ivh)/(Ivv+2Ivh)(Eq. 1) where Ivv and Ivh represent the fluorescence intensity signal parallel and perpendicular to the excitation polarization. All experiments were done in triplicate. To calculate the macroscopic DNA binding constant (KN), normalized data were plotted as average FA versus total protein concentration and fit to Equation 2, FA=FAmin+(FAmax−FAmin){(DT+x+1KN)−(DT+x+1KN)2−4DTx2DT}(Eq. 2) using nonlinear regression in SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc.), where FA is the observed FA signal; FAmin is the FA signal in the absence of protein; FAmax is the FA signal in the presence of saturating concentration of protein; DT is the total concentration of 6FAM-labeled DNA; x is the total protein concentration; and KN is the macroscopic binding constant. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three replicates. The binding of TraI to unlabeled DNA oligomers was investigated using the MCT method as described by Jezewska and Bujalowski (27Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, a 6FAM-labeled reference DNA oligomer (total concentration, DTR) was mixed with increasing concentrations of protein in DNA binding buffer in 384-well plates in the presence of a competing unlabeled DNA oligomer (total concentration, DTS). The fluorescence anisotropy of each well was measured using a Pherastar plate reader with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. The total protein concentration in the presence of a competing DNA oligomer, PT1, was defined as Equation 3, PT1=(∑Θi)RDTR+(∑Θi)SDTS+PF(Eq. 3) where (Σϴi)R, (Σϴi)S, and PF represent the binding density of the protein on the fluorescent DNA oligomer, the binding density on the unlabeled competing DNA oligomer, and the free protein concentration, respectively. In the absence of a competing DNA oligomer, Equation 3 can be simplified as shown in Equation 4, PT=(∑Θi)RDTR+PF(Eq. 4) When the same FA signal is observed in the absence and in the presence of a competing DNA oligomer, the binding density of the protein on the unlabeled competing DNA oligomer, defined as Equation 5, can be derived by solving the set of Equations 3 and 4. (∑Θi)=PT1−PTDTS(Eq. 5) When (Σϴi)S is known, PF can be obtained by using Equation 6, PF=PT1−(∑Θi)SDTS−(∑Θi)RDTR(Eq. 6) The binding stoichiometry is equal to the value of (Σϴi)S when FA reaches its maximum, as determined from the plot of FA versus (Σϴi)S. The model-independent and thermodynamically rigorous binding isotherm can then be constructed by plotting (Σϴi)S against PF. The binding isotherms were analyzed using the Epstein combinatorial approach for binding of a protein to a linear nucleic acid (28Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The relation between (Σϴi) and PF can be expressed as Equations 7 and 8, (∑Θi)=∑k=1g∑j=0k−1kPN(k,j)(KintPF)kωj∑k=0g∑j=0k−1PN(k,j)(KintPF)kωj(Eq. 7) PN(k,j)=(N−mk+1)!(k−1)!(N−mk−k+j+1)!(k−j)!j!(k−j−1)!(Eq. 8) Where k is the number of protein bound per nucleic acid; g is the maximum number of k; N is the total length of the nucleic acid; m is the size of nucleic acid-binding site; Kint is the intrinsic binding constant; ω is the cooperativity parameter, and j is the number of cooperative contacts formed between protein molecules bound to the nucleic acid. The combinatorial factor PN (k, j) defines the number of distinct ways that k protein molecules, each of which form j cooperative contacts, can bind to a nucleic acid. When the nucleic acid can maximally bind one protein molecule, Equations 7 and 8 can be simplified as Equations 9 or 10, (∑Θi)=(N−m+1)KintPF1+(N−m+1)KintPF(Eq. 9) (∑Θi)=KNPF1+KNPF(Eq. 10) A 6FAM-labeled DNA oligomer was used as the reference DNA. Protein was mixed with the reference DNA and titrated with increasing concentrations of an unlabeled DNA oligomer (the competitor DNA). The decrease in fluorescence anisotropy values with the titration of the competitor DNA was monitored. The IC50, or the concentration of competitor DNA required to displace 50% of the complex formed by protein and reference DNA, was determined by plotting the anisotropy value as a function of competitor DNA concentration and fitting the curve using Equation 11. FA=FAmin+FAmax−FAmin1+10(log IC50−x)(Eq. 11) The interaction between protein and DNA can be studied conveniently by quantitative titrations of a fluorescently labeled DNA with the protein of interest. However, the binding parameters obtained in this manner are often inaccurate due to the interference from the fluorescent probe. To understand the intrinsic DNA-binding property of TraI, we have studied the interaction of TraI with unlabeled DNA oligomers using the MCT method as described by Jezewska and Bujalowski (27Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (see also “Experimental Procedures”). This method has been successfully applied to the analysis of the interactions of the PriA and RepA helicases with DNA (29Jezewska M.J. Galletto R. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 115-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, a fluorescently labeled DNA oligomer, or the reference DNA, is titrated with TraI in the absence or presence of an unlabeled DNA oligomer, or the competing DNA, whose binding parameters are to be determined. Because the association of the unlabeled ssDNA oligomer with TraI does not give significant anisotropy signal, the presence of the unlabeled DNA oligomer will shift the titration curve to higher TraI concentration as compared with the curve generated in the absence of competitor. Based on the shift of the titration curve, this method allows the determination of the binding stoichiometry of TraI with an unlabeled DNA oligomer. The MCT method also enables the construction of a model-independent binding isotherm, which can be used for the determination of thermodynamically rigorous binding parameters for the unlabeled DNA oligomer. The protein constructs and DNA oligomers used for this study are listed in Fig. 1 and Table 1 respectively. The interaction of TraI with a series of unlabeled ssDNA oligomers of different lengths was studied using the MCT method (27Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Titration of 50 nm FL-T17 (fluorescently labeled T17) with TraI in the absence or presence of 200 or 350 nm ssDNA oligomers of lengths ranging from 13 to 63 nucleotides were conducted in standard DNA binding buffer (Fig. 2, A and B). The unlabeled 13-, 15-, and 17-mer ssDNA did not cause significant shift of the titration curves to higher TraI concentration, suggesting that TraI cannot bind tightly to unlabeled 13-, 15-, and 17-mer under our assay conditions. The binding stoichiometry of TraI with the 39-mer was determined by examining the dependence of anisotropy values on the binding density from the titration curves (Fig. 2C). The binding stoichiometry of TraI with the 39-mer was estimated to be one, because binding density equaled one at the maximum anisotropy value of 291. Analogous analyses of the binding stoichiometry were performed for DNA oligomers varying in length from 17 nucleotides to 63 nucleotides (data not shown). The dependence of maximum stoichiometry on the length of ssDNA oligomers indicated that 51- and 63-mers can accommodate two TraI molecules, whereas ssDNA oligomers shorter than 45 nucleotides can only accommodate one TraI molecule. To determine the binding parameters of TraI for the ssDNA oligomers, we constructed a model-independent binding isotherm for each ssDNA oligomer. Because ssDNA 13-, 15-, and 17-mer did not create a significant shift in the titration curve, their binding isotherms could not be accurately determined. The binding isotherms for the 19-mer and longer oligomers are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The macroscopic binding constants (KN) for 31-mer and below were determined by analyzing the binding isotherms with Equation 10 because these DNA oligomers can only accept one TraI molecule; the results are summarized in Table 2. The dependence of KN on the length of ssDNA oligomers (N) can be clearly divided into two phases. KN increased relatively slowly when N < 25 but faster when N >25. A roughly linear relationship between KN and N was observed when N ranges from 25 to 31 nucleotides (Fig. 3C). An explanation for this linear relationship is that TraI experiences multiple potential binding sites on an ssDNA longer than 25 nucleotides, indicating that the ssDNA-binding site size of TraI is about 25 nucleotides. The observed dramatic increase in KN was caused by a statistical factor arising from the existence of multiple potential binding sites, instead of the formation of more contacts between TraI and ssDNA oligomers (28Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Anderson C.F. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1637-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). This statistical factor can be defined in terms of the intrinsic binding constant (Kint) and the total site size (m) (29Jezewska M.J. Galletto R. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 115-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 12. KN=(N−m+1)Kint(Eq. 12) This empirical linear relationship usually appears only when the length of the DNA oligomer is longer than the total site size. In contrast, the slow increase of KN with N, when N <25, likely reflects the formation of increasing contacts between TraI and DNA. The intrinsic binding constants (Kint) for the ssDNA that bind one TraI molecule were determined by analyzing the binding isotherms in Fig. 3A using Equation 9 under the condition m = 25. The results were summarized in Table 2. The Kint did not change significantly with the length of the ssDNA oligomers, ranging from 1.8 ± 0.5 to 2.6 ± 0.3 × 107 m−1. This result supports the estimation of the total site size to be 25 nucleotides.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters of TraI binding to ssDNA oligomers of length ranging from 19 to 31 nucleotides in standard DNA binding buffer at 25 °CT19T21T23T25T27T29T31n1111111KN ×107 (m−1)0.9 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.36.2 ± 0.310 ± 112 ± 1Kint × 107 (m−1)NANANA2.6 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Because the total site size is ∼25 nucleotides, complete engagement of the ssDNA-binding site of two TraI molecules should require ssDNA of at least 50 nucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W2020769436,"H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase; EC 3.6.1.1) drives proton transport against an electrochemical potential gradient by hydrolyzing pyrophosphate (PPi) and is found in various endomembranes of higher plants, bacteria, and some protists. H+-PPase contains seven highly conserved lysines. We examined the functional roles of these lysines, which are, for the most part, found in the cytosolic regions of mung bean H+-PPase by site-directed mutagenesis. Construction of mutants that each had a cytosolic and highly conserved lysine substituted with an alanine resulted in dramatic drops in the PPi hydrolytic activity. The effects caused by ions on the activities of WT and mutant H+-PPases suggest that Lys-730 may be in close proximity to the Mg2+-binding site, and the great resistance of the K694A and K695A mutants to fluoride inhibition suggests that these lysines are present in the active site. The modifier fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled a lysine at the H+-PPase active site but did not inhibit the hydrolytic activities of K250A, K250N, K250T, and K250S, which suggested that Lys-250 is essential for substrate binding and may be involved in proton translocation. Analysis of tryptic digests indicated that Lys-711 and Lys-717 help maintain the conformation of the active site. Proteolytic evidence also demonstrated that Lys-250 is the primary target of trypsin and confirmed its crucial role in H+-PPase hydrolysis. H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase; EC 3.6.1.1) drives proton transport against an electrochemical potential gradient by hydrolyzing pyrophosphate (PPi) and is found in various endomembranes of higher plants, bacteria, and some protists. H+-PPase contains seven highly conserved lysines. We examined the functional roles of these lysines, which are, for the most part, found in the cytosolic regions of mung bean H+-PPase by site-directed mutagenesis. Construction of mutants that each had a cytosolic and highly conserved lysine substituted with an alanine resulted in dramatic drops in the PPi hydrolytic activity. The effects caused by ions on the activities of WT and mutant H+-PPases suggest that Lys-730 may be in close proximity to the Mg2+-binding site, and the great resistance of the K694A and K695A mutants to fluoride inhibition suggests that these lysines are present in the active site. The modifier fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled a lysine at the H+-PPase active site but did not inhibit the hydrolytic activities of K250A, K250N, K250T, and K250S, which suggested that Lys-250 is essential for substrate binding and may be involved in proton translocation. Analysis of tryptic digests indicated that Lys-711 and Lys-717 help maintain the conformation of the active site. Proteolytic evidence also demonstrated that Lys-250 is the primary target of trypsin and confirmed its crucial role in H+-PPase hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2169437979,"Polydactyly is a common malformation and can be an isolated anomaly or part of a pleiotropic syndrome. The elucidation of the mutated genes that cause polydactyly provides insight into limb development pathways. The extra-toes spotting (Xs) mouse phenotype manifests anterior polydactyly, predominantly in the forelimbs, with ventral hypopigmenation. The mapping of Xs(J) to chromosome 7 was confirmed, and the interval was narrowed to 322 kb using intersubspecific crosses. Two mutations were identified in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C (Eif3c). An Eif3c c.907C>T mutation (p.Arg303X) was identified in Xs(J), and a c.1702_1758del mutation (p.Leu568_Leu586del) was identified in extra-toes spotting-like (Xsl), an allele of Xs(J). The effect of the Xs(J) mutation on the SHH/GLI3 pathway was analyzed by in situ hybridization analysis, and we show that Xs mouse embryos have ectopic Shh and Ptch1 expression in the anterior limb. In addition, anterior limb buds show aberrant Gli3 processing, consistent with perturbed SHH/GLI3 signaling. Based on the occurrence of Eif3c mutations in 2 Xs lines and haploinsufficiency of the Xs(J) allele, we conclude that the Xs phenotype is caused by a mutation in Eif3c, a component of the translation initiation complex, and that the phenotype is associated with aberrant SHH/GLI3 signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2033209454,"Ten years already? There have been cycles: When we produced the first sequence, we were all amazed to see the lower-than-expected gene count and the size of each of the categories of the functional class of gene products—even though we had no clue about the functional roles of at least one-half of them. Many of us also expected wide enthusiasm for more sequencing, more biology, and more discovery. Instead, the community was slow to warm up to genomics. Sequencing the first human genome really changed the way all biologists work, but it did not change many opinions about “big science.” Now, after several years of model organism genomes, deep surveys of genetic variation, and a burst of technical development, appetites are increasing for DNA sequencing and experiments on the scale of the human genome project. In studies of human biology, personal diploid genome sequences have shown the way forward, but the most exciting data now are from solving the genetics of individual Mendelian disorders, where the phenotype-genotype relationships really make sense. The new methods and the willingness to tackle human Mendelian genetics, with attention to modifiers and heterogeneity, will enable the realization of the impact of genomics in genetics. Genomics became a discipline that was separated from genetics more than 20 years ago, but now the two are coming back together."

If I ever knew the answer, I am becoming less clear all the time, thanks in part to discoveries related to the human genome. The irony is discomforting. As we gain precision, we seem to be losing conceptual clarity.

The “human” genome, it turns out, consists of sequences that are widely shared across the evolutionary tree. The microbes inside us, outnumbering our human cells ten to one, have their own genomes that interact with our DNA, contributing to our individual and species identity. Comparisons between the human genome and that of other primates, such as chimpanzees, suggest that the boundary of our much-vaunted human “uniqueness” is thin indeed. The sequence of a major portion of Neandertal DNA can now be compared with our own, and we are learning that Neandertals are hardly extinct, their DNA living on in many of us. Tantalizing discoveries now suggest that we once shared the planet with the newly discovered Denisova hominin, which appears to have interbred with some of our ancestors as recently as 40,000 years ago.

The Human Genome Project undermines cherished ideas about human uniqueness. But it also hints at a new vision of humanity. We are less clearly defined than we once thought, less set apart from the rest of life, but uniquely able to probe the data and ponder the questions. And, being humans, we let our discomfort give way to wonder. Who are we, and where will we go next?"
