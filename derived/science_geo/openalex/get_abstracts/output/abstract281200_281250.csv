https://openalex.org/W2029887423,"The relation of ozone dose to injury of susceptible mesophyll tissue under natural conditions has not been shown to be nonlinear. Apparent nonlinearity in the relation may be a consequence of not measuring ozone uptake, of ignoring the concentration- and time-dependent limitation imposed by stomatal closure, of disregarding the meaning of threshold dose, and of using a non-linear method of rating injury. It is probable that a constant related to the rate of absorption is the governing parameter under a given set in environmental conditions. Where the latter are varying, as in the field, it is necessary to apply to the ozone dose, computed from measurements taken at a given point, a correction factor such as one derivable from prevailing micrometeorological conditions, in order to arrive at an expression of effective ozone dose. 9 references."
