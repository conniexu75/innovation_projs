https://openalex.org/W1506453366,"The administration of leptin to leptin-deficient humans, and the analogous Lepob/Lepob mice, effectively reduces hyperphagia and obesity. But common obesity is associated with elevated leptin, which suggests that obese humans are resistant to this adipocyte hormone. In addition to regulating long-term energy balance, leptin also rapidly affects neuronal activity. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide-Y types of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are both principal sites of leptin receptor expression and the source of potent neuropeptide modulators, melanocortins and neuropeptide Y, which exert opposing effects on feeding and metabolism. These neurons are therefore ideal for characterizing leptin action and the mechanism of leptin resistance; however, their diffuse distribution makes them difficult to study. Here we report electrophysiological recordings on POMC neurons, which we identified by targeted expression of green fluorescent protein in transgenic mice. Leptin increases the frequency of action potentials in the anorexigenic POMC neurons by two mechanisms: depolarization through a nonspecific cation channel; and reduced inhibition by local orexigenic neuropeptide-Y/GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurons. Furthermore, we show that melanocortin peptides have an autoinhibitory effect on this circuit. On the basis of our results, we propose an integrated model of leptin action and neuronal architecture in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W1997369314,"Intracellular deposition of aggregated and ubiquitylated proteins is a prominent cytopathological feature of most neurodegenerative disorders. Whether protein aggregates themselves are pathogenic or are the consequence of an underlying molecular lesion is unclear. Here, we report that protein aggregation directly impaired the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Transient expression of two unrelated aggregation-prone proteins, a huntingtin fragment containing a pathogenic polyglutamine repeat and a folding mutant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, caused nearly complete inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because of the central role of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in regulating fundamental cellular events such as cell division and apoptosis, our data suggest a potential mechanism linking protein aggregation to cellular disregulation and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2030011352,"Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), the pathogenic agent of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a physiological metabolite in the brain. We examined the role of neprilysin, a candidate Abeta-degrading peptidase, in the metabolism using neprilysin gene-disrupted mice. Neprilysin deficiency resulted in defects both in the degradation of exogenously administered Abeta and in the metabolic suppression of the endogenous Abeta levels in a gene dose-dependent manner. The regional levels of Abeta in the neprilysin-deficient mouse brain were in the distinct order of hippocampus, cortex, thalamus/striatum, and cerebellum, where hippocampus has the highest level and cerebellum the lowest, correlating with the vulnerability to Abeta deposition in brains of humans with AD. Our observations suggest that even partial down-regulation of neprilysin activity, which could be caused by aging, can contribute to AD development by promoting Abeta accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2004623573,"Quantifying the impact of density, extrinsic climatic fluctuations, and demography on population fluctuations is a persistent challenge in ecology. We analyzed the effect of these processes on the irregular pattern of population crashes of Soay sheep on the St. Kilda archipelago, United Kingdom. Because the age and sex structure of the population fluctuates independently of population size, and because animals of different age and sex respond in different ways to density and weather, identical weather conditions can result in different dynamics in populations of equal size. In addition, the strength of density-dependent processes is a function of the distribution of weather events. Incorporating demographic heterogeneities into population models can influence dynamics and their response to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1973466311,"Impulsive choice is exemplified by choosing a small or poor reward that is available immediately, in preference to a larger but delayed reward. Impulsive choice contributes to drug addiction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania, and personality disorders, but its neuroanatomical basis is unclear. Here, we show that selective lesions of the nucleus accumbens core induce persistent impulsive choice in rats. In contrast, damage to two of its afferents, the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, had no effect on this capacity. Thus, dysfunction of the nucleus accumbens core may be a key element in the neuropathology of impulsivity."

Despite steep longitudinal and latitudinal gradients in total species richness, the composition of these key taxa is constrained within a remarkably narrow range of values. Regional-scale variation in reef biodiversity is best explained by large-scale patterns in the availability of shallow-water habitat. Once habitat area is accounted for, there is surprisingly little residual effect of latitude or longitude. Low-diversity regions are most vulnerable to human impacts such as global warming, underscoring the urgent need for integrated management at multinational scales."

https://openalex.org/W1976149501,"Dysfunction of the tubby protein results in maturity-onset obesity in mice. Tubby has been implicated as a transcription regulator, but details of the molecular mechanism underlying its function remain unclear. Here we show that tubby functions in signal transduction from heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. Tubby localizes to the plasma membrane by binding phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate through its carboxyl terminal ""tubby domain."" X-ray crystallography reveals the atomic-level basis of this interaction and implicates tubby domains as phosphorylated-phosphatidyl- inositol binding factors. Receptor-mediated activation of G protein alphaq (Galphaq) releases tubby from the plasma membrane through the action of phospholipase C-beta, triggering translocation of tubby to the cell nucleus. The localization of tubby-like protein 3 (TULP3) is similarly regulated. These data suggest that tubby proteins function as membrane-bound transcription regulators that translocate to the nucleus in response to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, providing a direct link between G-protein signaling and the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1991198986,"Restoration of blood flow to ischemic myocardial tissue results in an increase in the production of oxygen radicals. Highly reactive, free radical species have the potential to damage cellular components. Clearly, maintenance of cellular viability is dependent, in part, on the removal of altered protein. The proteasome is a major intracellular proteolytic system which degrades oxidized and ubiquitinated forms of protein. Utilizing an in vivo rat model, we demonstrate that coronary occlusion/reperfusion resulted in declines in chymotrypsin-like, peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase, and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome as assayed in cytosolic extracts. Analysis of purified 20 S proteasome revealed that declines in peptidase activities were accompanied by oxidative modification of the protein. We provide conclusive evidence that, upon coronary occlusion/reperfusion, the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal selectively modifies 20 S proteasome α-like subunits iota, C3, and an isoform of XAPC7. Occlusion/reperfusion-induced declines in trypsin-like activity were largely preserved upon proteasome purification. In contrast, loss in chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities observed in cytosolic extracts were not evident upon purification. Thus, decreases in proteasome activity are likely due to both direct oxidative modification of the enzyme and inhibition of fluorogenic peptide hydrolysis by endogenous cytosolic inhibitory protein(s) and/or substrate(s). Along with inhibition of the proteasome, increases in cytosolic levels of oxidized and ubiquitinated protein(s) were observed. Taken together, our findings provide insight into potential mechanisms of coronary occlusion/reperfusion-induced proteasome inactivation and cellular consequences of these events.

Thus, the presence of oxidized protein could impact cellular function by changing the catalytic and/or regulatory properties of specific proteins and by placing abnormal demands on finite cellular volume. Clearly, the level of oxidatively modified protein reflects the balance between free radical damage and proteolytic degradation. It is therefore important to investigate the response of proteases involved in the degradation of oxidized protein to coronary ischemia/reperfusion. Oxidatively modified proteins are preferentially degraded in vitro by the 20 S proteasome in an ATP-independent fashion (18Friguet B. Szweda L.I. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem.

The 20 S proteasome is the catalytic core of the 26 S proteasome and is comprised of four heptameric rings arranged coaxially.

Thus, alterations in proteasome activity during coronary occlusion/reperfusion would be expected to significantly impact a number of cellular events, thereby influencing the outcome of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion. The current study was undertaken to characterize the effects of coronary occlusion/reperfusion on proteasome peptidase activities and to begin to assess how alterations in proteasome function may contribute to the development of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results demonstrate that in vivo coronary occlusion/reperfusion induced significant declines in proteasome function. This was accompanied by selective free radical derived modification of specific proteasome subunits. Increases in the cytosolic levels of oxidatively modified and ubiquitinated proteins occurred commensurate with declines in proteasome peptidase activities. Mechanisms by which oxidative modification of the proteasome leads to enzyme inactivation are discussed in light of previous in vitro findings. In addition, potential physiological consequences of loss of proteasome activity are related to observed increases in cytosolic levels of oxidized protein and declines in the ability of myocytes to degrade ubiquitinated protein. In a modification of a previously described procedure (36Powers S.K. Demirel H.A. Vincent H.K. Coombes J.S. Naito H. Hamilton K.L. Shanely R.A. Jessup J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1468-1477PubMed Google Scholar), male Harlan-Sprague Dawley rats were anesthetized by intramuscular administration of a mixture of xylazine, ketamine/HCl, and acepromazine (3:3:1) (0.5–0.75 ml/kg). To ensure the stability of blood pH throughout the experiments, a solution composed of 0.9% NaCl, 8.4% NaHCO3, 50% dextrose (4:3:3) was injected intraperitoneally (200–300 µl/g) 30 min prior to administration of anesthesia. An endotracheal tube was inserted and used for ventilation with oxygen-supplemented room air using a positive pressure respirator (5–15 mm Hg). Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a rectal probe attached to a thermocoupled thermometer and an appropriate heating lamp. The heart was exposed by performing a midline thoracotomy. After the animal had been allowed to stabilize for 15 min, a ligature was placed around the left anterior descending coronary artery close to its origin from the aorta. The ends were exteriorized and passed through polyethylene tubing. Coronary occlusion was achieved by pressing the tube against the heart muscle while pulling on the ligature followed by clamping the tube with a hemostat. This was accompanied by immediate palor of the left ventricular free wall and a marked drop in blood pressure. Reflow was initiated by releasing the ligature. This was accompanied by immediate hyperemia of the left ventricular free wall as well as a marked increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Experimental conditions tested were: 1) 90 min of control perfusion; and 2) 30 min of LAD coronary occlusion followed by 60 min of reperfusion (n = 5 rats for each procedure). Cytosolic fractions were prepared from the left ventricular free wall following each experimental protocol. Briefly, hearts were excised and the left ventricular free wall rapidly removed and minced. Tissue was then immersed and rinsed in cold homogenization buffers (180 mm KCl, 5 mmMOPS,1 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.25). This was followed by homogenization in 25 ml of homogenization buffer/g of ventricle with a Polytron homogenizer (low setting, 3 s). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C yielding a pellet corresponding to crude nuclear fraction. The 500 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The 5,000 × g supernatant represents the crude cytosolic fraction. Protein determinations were made using the BCA method (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cytosolic fractions were immediately frozen at −70 °C for later assay. Control experiments indicated no differences between proteasome peptidase activities assayed immediately upon isolation of cytosolic fractions versus those measured using frozen and thawed samples. Proteasome peptidase substrates and products Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (LLVY-MCA),N-t-Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-7-amido-4-methyl-coumarin (LSTR-MCA), N-Cbz-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide (LLE-NA), 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, and β-naphthylamine were purchased from Sigma. Chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities of the proteasome were assayed using the fluorogenic peptides LLVY-MCA (25 µm), LSTR-MCA (40 µm), and LLE-NA (150 µm), respectively (37Conconi M. Friguet B. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 45-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Conconi M. Petropoulos I. Emod I. Turlin E. Biville F. Friguet B. Biochem.

Assays were carried out using 10 µg of cytosolic protein in a total volume of 200 µl. The assay buffer was composed of 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 and contained the appropriate peptide substrate. Following incubation at 37 °C for 0 to 30 min, the reaction was quenched by addition of 300 µl of acid or ethanol. A 2.0-ml aliquot of H2O was then added and the fluorescence of the samples was evaluated using a Bio-Tek Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorimeter. The excitation/emission wavelengths are 350/440 and 333/410 nm for aminomethycoumarin and β-naphthylamine products, respectively. Peptidase activities were measured in the absence and presence (20 µm) of the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG-132 (N-Cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal) and the difference between the two rates was attributed to the proteasome. Specific peptidase activities were determined by comparison to a standard curve generated using pure fluorescent products. As determined in control experiments, peptidase activities were linear for 60 min under the conditions of the assays. For assay of purified 20 S proteasome peptidase activities, 2.0 µg of protein was utilized. The 20 S proteasome was purified from cytosolic fractions obtained from left ventricular homogenate as previously described, with minor modifications (18Friguet B. Szweda L.I. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Conconi M. Friguet B. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 45-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rivett A.J. Savory P.J.

Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Prior to purification of the proteasome, respective cytosolic extracts prepared after 90 min of control perfusion (n = 5) or 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 60 min of reperfusion (n = 5) were pooled. Briefly, pooled cytosolic fractions containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol were subjected to an ammonium sulfate cut (35 and 60% saturation). The 60% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2, and dialyzed at 4 °C against the same buffer. Purification was then achieved by ion exchange chromatography over a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) utilizing a Beckman Gold liquid chromatograph. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Novex Minicell II). For detection of protein-associated carbonyl groups, samples were treated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, as summarized below, prior to resolution of protein(s) by SDS-PAGE. The polyacrylamide content of gels for particular experiments was as indicated in the figure legends. Typically, one gel of a series was stained with Coomassie Blue. The second gel was used to electroblot protein onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were processed according to standard protocols with minor modifications, depending on the primary antibody utilized, as detailed below. Proteasome complexes present in cytosolic extracts were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis followed by activity staining or immunoblotting. Cytosolic proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions as described (41Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Reinheckel T. Sitte N. Ullrich O. Kuckelkorn U. Davies K.J. Grune T. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The stacking and running gels contained 3 and 6% polyacrylamide, respectively, and the gel was run for 650 V-h at 4 °C. The gel was incubated in 50 mm Tris, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, at pH 7.8 for 15 min at 37 °C. The gel was then mounted on a light box and bathed in the same solution containing 100 µmLLVY-MCA and 5.0 mm ATP. Activities of the proteasome complexes were visualized after exposure of the gel to substrate for 30.0 min. For Western blot experiments, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with appropriate primary antibodies. For both activity and Western blot staining, assignment of proteasome complexes was accomplished by comparison with purified 20 S and 26 S complexes. The first dimension was performed utilizing Immobilines Drystrips (pH 3–10, length 13 cm) and the Multiphor II isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 15-µg aliquot of purified proteasome was diluted in sample buffer (9 m urea, 2% Chaps, 2% Pharmalytes pH 3–10, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue). The Drystrip was rehydrated in this solution in a Re-swelling Tray (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at room temperature and then focused for 50,000 V-h (23 h). After focusing, the Immobilines Drystrips were equilibrated for 10 min in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1% w/v SDS) supplemented with 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol followed by 10 min in equilibration buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide. The second dimension, SDS-PAGE, was performed using a 12% (w/v) gel and the Protean II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were stained with silver nitrate and the gel digitized utilizing a JX-330 Sharp scanner. Spot detection and quantification were performed using Imagemaster two-dimensional Elite software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The subunit pattern and spot densities of 20 S proteasome purified after reperfusion (Fig. 3 B) were evaluated utilizing those obtained following perfusion (Fig.3 A) as a reference. To select unambiguous modifications in the pattern of proteasome subunits between the two samples, the level of significance was set to a 2-fold variation in the protein spot intensity as determined by computerized analysis. For two-dimensional Western blot experiments, two-dimensional gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed using appropriate primary antibodies. One- and two-dimensional Western blots were evaluated utilizing a series of primary antibodies, as indicated. Blocking buffer was composed of 0.2% (w/v) I-block (Tropix) in PBS supplemented with Tween 20 (0.05% w/v). Washing buffer was comprised of phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20. Primary antibody binding was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase based chemiluminescence assay (Tropix and Amersham). As indicated, control experiments were performed in which normal rabbit serum was utilized instead of primary antibodies. Polyclonal antibody raised against purified 20 S proteasome has previously been prepared (rabbit host) (40Conconi M. Szweda L.I. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Friguet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to proteasome subunits C2 (MCP 20), C3 (MCP 21), XAPC7 (MCP 34), and Rpt1 (ATPase subunit of PA700) were obtained from Affiniti Research Products Limited. Antibody IB5, which is specific for the iota subunit, was a gift from Mathias Kroll (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Prior to gel electrophoresis, protein-associated carbonyls were derivatized by treatment of protein samples with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine utilizing Intergen reagents and protocols (Oxyblot kit). We have previously prepared and characterized polyclonal antibodies specific to 1:1 amino acid-HNE Michael adducts (rabbit host) (43Uchida K. Szweda L.I. Chae H.Z. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8742-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies (rabbit host) specific to ubiquitin were obtained from StressGen and Dako. The effects of occlusion/reperfusion on peptidase activities of cardiac proteasome were evaluated utilizing anin vivo rat model in which coronary occlusion was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery and reperfusion was initiated by removal of the ligature. In this study, anesthetized rats were subjected to 90 min of instrumented perfusion or 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Upon completion of each experimental protocol, the left ventricle was homogenized and cytosolic fractions were prepared. Chymotrypsin-like, peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase, and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome present in cytosolic extracts were then assayed using appropriate fluorogenic peptide substrates. As shown in Fig.1, each of these peptidase activities declined as a result of coronary occlusion/reperfusion. Trypsin-like activity was most sensitive to inactivation, exhibiting a 75% decline in activity relative to perfusion values, while chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities decreased 43 and 30%, respectively. In control experiments, it was determined that peptidase activities did not vary between 0 and 90 min of instrumented perfusion, indicating that observed alterations in proteasome function were due to events which occurred during coronary occlusion/reperfusion. Furthermore, declines in peptidase activities were not due to a loss in tissue proteasome content, as judged by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis utilizing polyclonal antibodies prepared to purified 20 S proteasome and Rpt1, a subunit of the PA700 complex of the 26 S proteasome (not shown) (40Conconi M.

The mechanism by which enucleation occurs is not well understood. Here we show that deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II) is indispensable for definitive erythropoiesis in mouse fetal liver. No live DNase II–null mice were born, owing to severe anemia. When mutant fetal liver cells were transferred into lethally irradiated wild-type mice, mature red blood cells were generated from the mutant cells, suggesting that DNase II functions in a non–cell-autonomous manner. Histochemical analyses indicated that the critical cellular sources of DNase II are macrophages present at the site of definitive erythropoiesis in the fetal liver. Thus, DNase II in macrophages appears to be responsible for destroying the nuclear DNA expelled from erythroid precursor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000291134,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels are activated by various metabolic stresses, including hypoxia. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the area with the highest expression of K(ATP) channels in the brain, plays a pivotal role in the control of seizures. Mutant mice lacking the Kir6.2 subunit of K(ATP) channels [knockout (KO) mice] were susceptible to generalized seizures after brief hypoxia. In normal mice, SNr neuron activity was inactivated during hypoxia by the opening of the postsynaptic K(ATP) channels, whereas in KO mice, the activity of these neurons was enhanced. K(ATP) channels exert a depressant effect on SNr neuronal activity during hypoxia and may be involved in the nigral protection mechanism against generalized seizures."

The specific membranes to which cPLA2 translocates and the [Ca2+]isignals required were investigated. Plasmids of EGFP fused to full-length cPLA2 (EGFP-FL) or to the cPLA2 C2 domain (EGFP-C2) were used in Ca2+/EGFP imaging experiments of cells treated with [Ca2+]i-mobilizing agonists. EGFP-FL and -C2 translocated to Golgi in response to sustained [Ca2+]i greater than ∼100–125 nm and to Golgi, ER, and perinuclear membranes (PNM) at [Ca2+]i greater than ∼210–280 nm. In response to short duration [Ca2+]i transients, EGFP-C2 translocated to Golgi, ER, and PNM, but EGFP-FL translocation was restricted to Golgi. However, EGFP-FL translocated to Golgi, ER, and PNM in response to long duration transients. In response to declining [Ca2+]i, EGFP-C2 readily dissociated from Golgi, but EGFP-FL dissociation was delayed. Agonist-induced arachidonic acid release was proportional to the [Ca2+]i and to the extent of cPLA2translocation. In summary, we find that the differential translocation of cPLA2 to Golgi or to ER and PNM is a function of [Ca2+]i amplitude and duration.

However, there has been little evidence for assigning a specific organelle as the target of Ca2+-induced translocation, and few studies have attempted localization of cPLA2 with high spatial resolution (16Glover S. de Carvalho M.S.

Previous studies have determined, however, that cPLA2 does not translocate to the plasma membrane. A number of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists regulate cPLA2 activity and AA release (8Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.-L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For example, in MDCK cells, P2Y2 (P2U) receptor activation and an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated intracellular [Ca2+]i release mediate cPLA2-dependent AA release (19Xing M. Firestein B.L.

Other studies have associated cPLA2-mediated AA release with an agonist-induced, extracellular [Ca2+]i influx, resulting in a sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i(17Hirabayashi T. Kume K. Hirose K.

In addition to a [Ca2+]i increase, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is involved in cPLA2 regulation and is required for AA release in MDCK cells (22Xing M. Insel P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In other cell types, both an increase in [Ca2+]i and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation is required for maximal cPLA2 activation (11Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 23Qiu Z.-H. Gijón M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the [Ca2+]i signals that regulate cPLA2translocation or AA release have not been investigated rigorously in live cells. To determine the specific [Ca2+]i requirements for translocation of cPLA2 and to verify the identity of the membranes to which cPLA2 translocates, we used MDCK cells expressing full-length cPLA2 or the cPLA2C2 domain fused to an EGFP marker. Using immunocytochemical methods and a live cell dye, we identified Golgi, ER, and a perinuclear membrane (PNM) as targets of cPLA2 translocation. Simultaneous EGFP/Fura2 imaging of cells in response to sustained [Ca2+]i of increasing amplitudes revealed that full-length cPLA2 and the cPLA2 C2 domain exhibited similar [Ca2+]i requirements for translocation to Golgi, ER, and PNM but that the [Ca2+]i threshold for translocation to the Golgi was lower than it was to the ER and PNM. Imaging experiments in response to transient [Ca2+]i signals of different duration showed that the cPLA2 C2 domain translocated more rapidly to membrane than did full-length cPLA2. In response to [Ca2+]ideclines, full-length cPLA2 remained associated with membrane targets longer than the cPLA2 C2 domain. AA release was found to be proportional to the extent of translocation and to the [Ca2+]i. These results demonstrate that the Golgi, ER, and PNM are principle targets of cPLA2translocation. They also reveal a differential membrane targeting mechanism that is dependent on [Ca2+]i amplitude and duration. These results suggest that the C2 domain is involved in differential, Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting and that the catalytic domain retards translocation and is required for prolonged enzyme residence at the membrane. DNA encoding human cPLA2 was cloned into the vector pCR2.1 as previously described (11Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J.

Using the polylinkerSacI and PstI sites, the cPLA2-containing fragment was cloned into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) to create pEGFP-cPLA2full-length (pEGFP-FL). For construction of pEGFP-C2, the C2 region of cPLA2 (encoding Ser17 to Met148) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pEGFP-FL using the primers 5′-CTCAAGCTTTCCCACAAGTTTACGGTA-3′ (which contains aHindIII restriction site) and 5′-GATCCCGGGCATACTAAATCGTAGGTC-3′ (which contains a SmaI restriction site). The PCR product was cut with HindIII andSmaI and cloned into pEGFP-C3 using the HindIII and SmaI sites. Empty vector (pEGFP-C3) was used for control. The constructions were confirmed by sequencing. MDCK cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.292 mg/ml glutamine (growth medium) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subconfluent cells (1 × 104 cells/cm2) were transfected with 1 µg of the relevant plasmid using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.292 mg/ml glutamine (labeling medium) following the manufacturer's protocol. For studies using transient transfection, MDCK cells were grown on a glass-bottomed 35-mm tissue culture plate (MatTek, Ashland, MA), transfected, and used within 24 h. Stable lines of transfected cells were generated by growing transfected cells in growth medium for 3 days, supplementing the growth medium with 5 mg/ml Geneticin (antibiotic G418-sulfate), and culturing for an additional 2 weeks in Geneticin. Cells expressing EGFP fluorescence were selected using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The EGFP-positive cells were maintained in growth medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml Geneticin. For imaging studies, stably transfected cells were plated on MatTek dishes at 1 × 104cells/cm2 in growth medium with G418, incubated overnight, changed into labeling medium (without G418) to quiesce the cells, incubated overnight, and used the next day. Stable transfectants were grown on 100-mm dishes at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in growth medium. Cells were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 200 µm sodium vanadate, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. Laemmli electrophoresis sample buffer (5×) was added to the lysates, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed using 35 µg of lysate protein (24Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M.

Transiently transfected cells on MatTek plates were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HHBSS) and stimulated with either 100 µm ATP or 10 µm ionomycin (IONO). Cells were fixed 45 s after stimulation in PBS containing 3.2% paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed in PBS, and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then labeled with either a 1:100 dilution of anti-golgin 97 antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or with a 1:100 dilution of anti-nucleoporin 97 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 60 min. After washing with PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were stained with a TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were visualized using a Nikon diaphot inverted microscope with a 60×, 1.4 NA oil immersion lens and a Photometrics CCD camera using FITC filters for the EGFP fluorescence and TRITC filters for the antibody fluorescence. Images were acquired with IP Labs software (Scanalytics, Inc.) and processed with Adobe Photoshop. Stably transfected cells grown on MatTek plates were washed with HHBSS containing 1 mm probenecid and incubated with 10 µmFura2-AM (Calbiochem) in HHBSS, 1 mm probenecid, and 1% Me2SO for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with HHBSS containing 1 mm probenecid and imaged after a 30-min incubation for de-esterification of the Fura2-AM. Single-cell imaging was performed on a Nikon inverted microscope using a 40×, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective, Fura2 and FITC filter sets (Chroma), and a CCD camera (Cooke). Image acquisition and analysis were performed with SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). For calcium clamping experiments, images of Fura2 and EGFP fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm and 480 nm, respectively, were taken at each extracellular [Ca2+]. For time lapse imaging, Fura2/EGFP image sets were taken at 4–11-s intervals. The [Ca2+]i was determined using the equation, [Ca2+]i = K D × β × (R −R min)/(R max −R) (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where R was determined from the average background-corrected pixel values of the Fura2 fluorescence from the cytoplasmic area of individual cells from 340- and 380-nm image pairs;R min, R max, and β were determined by in situ calibration at the conclusion of each experiment; and a value of 224 nm was used for theK D of Fura2. EGFP fluorescence was determined for different regions of interest by calculating theF t/F 0, whereF t is the background- and bleach-corrected EGFP fluorescence at time t, and F 0 is the background-corrected EGFP fluorescence at time 0. Profile plots of EGFP fluorescence were performed using NIH Image software (developed by the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Time lapse EGFP imaging not involving [Ca2+]i measurements (see Figs. 2, 3,J–L, and 4, D–G and K–N) were performed using an inverted Nikon microscope using a 60×, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective, a Photometrics CCD camera, FITC filters (Chroma), and IP Labs software.Figure 3Disruption of Golgi structure with BFA or NOC. See the Fig. 3 movies at http://www.jbc.org. EGFP-C2-transfected cells were incubated with 10 µg/ml BFA (A–C) or 20 µm NOC (H–J) for 3 h at 37 °C in HHBSS. Cells were stimulated with 100 µm ATP and stained with anti-golgin 97 antibody as described in Fig. 2. ATP stimulation of BFA-treated cells resulted in a punctate distribution of EGFP-C2 fluorescence (A) that was similar to the pattern of golgin 97 distribution (B), resulting in a considerable overlap of the two fluorescence signals (C). In time lapse imaging of cells incubated with 10 µg/ml BFA for 3 h and stimulated with 100 µm ATP (D and E), EGFP-C2 fluorescence exhibited a punctate distribution, which was reversed by a 2-h wash-out of the drug and readdition of ATP (F andG). ATP stimulation of NOC-treated cells resulted in a punctate distribution of EGFP-C2 fluorescence consistent with the ministack formation (H) that was similar to the pattern of golgin 97 distribution (I), resulting in a considerable overlap of the two fluorescence signals (J). In time lapse imaging of cells incubated with 20 µm NOC for 3 h and stimulated with 100 µm ATP (K andL), EGFP-C2 fluorescence exhibited a punctate distribution, which was reversed by a 1-h wash-out of the drug and readdition of ATP (M and N).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Translocation of EGFP-FL at sustained [Ca2+]i. Stably transfected cells expressing EGFP-FL, loaded with Fura2, were subjected to step increases in the [Ca2+]e of an EGTA-buffered bath solution that resulted in step increases in the [Ca2+]i of the cells (calcium clamp conditions). Fura2 ratio pair and EGFP images were taken at each [Ca2+]i step, and the [Ca2+]i was determined. B–F, EGFP-FL fluorescence images at the indicated [Ca2+]ivalues are shown. G, plot profiles along vectors (shown inA) of the EGFP intensity across regions of ER, Golgi, and the PNM were produced at each [Ca2+]i step (B–F). Intensity measurements across ER also included surrounding regions of cytoplasm (cyt). Intensity measurements across the PNM also included surrounding regions of cytoplasm (cyt) and nucleoplasm (nuc).

Briefly, MDCK cells were freshly plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 104cells/well (1 × 104 cells/cm2) and incubated in growth medium overnight. Cells were then washed with labeling medium and labeled with 0.2 µCi of [3H]arachidonic acid/well in labeling medium overnight. Cells were stimulated with the agonist of choice, and the medium was collected at appropriate time points. The medium was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the amount of radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. Cells were scraped in 0.5 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 for determining the total cellular radioactivity. Previous immunocytochemical and GFP fusion protein studies have consistently described the pattern of cPLA2 translocation in response to a saturating [Ca2+]i as perinuclear (10Perisic O.

To identify the membrane domains to which cPLA2 translocates in response to an increase in [Ca2+]i, EGFP-cPLA2 fusion proteins were constructed (Fig.1 A) and expressed in MDCK cells. Previous studies have shown that EGFP fused to the amino terminus of cPLA2 does not affect its function (11Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, the EGFP fusion of full-length cPLA2(EGFP-FL) was expressed in MDCK cells at approximately the same level as the endogenous cPLA2. The EGFP fusion containing the cPLA2 C2 domain (EGFP-C2, amino acids 17–148) was also expressed in MDCK cells at the same level as endogenous cPLA2. Structural studies and a previous GFP fusion protein study showed that amino acids 1–16 do not contribute to the C2 domain structure (2Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J.

Rapid translocation of the EGFP-FL fusion protein in response to saturating [Ca2+]i was elicited by bath application of the Ca2+ ionophore IONO (10 µm) and observed in live cells by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 C). EGFP-FL distribution was mostly cytoplasmic in resting cells but not totally homogeneous, since a dark reticulated structure was apparent in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C). EGFP-FL fusion protein translocated from the cytoplasm to three distinct intracellular regions in response to an increase in [Ca2+]i: a juxtanuclear region, a perinuclear region, and a reticulated region in the cytoplasm. A similar pattern of translocation was observed with the EGFP-C2 fusion protein, but no translocation of the empty EGFP vector was observed after stimulation with IONO (not shown). The fluorescence patterns of the translocated EGFP-FL and -C2 fusions are similar to what has been observed in previous studies using high dose ionophore to elicit a supraphysiological [Ca2+]i increase and translocation (10Perisic O.

To confirm the identity of the intracellular membranes targeted by cPLA2, we used immunocytochemical methods and a live cell organelle-specific dye. Cells expressing EGFP-FL and -C2 were stimulated with the P2Y2 agonist ATP or IONO to elicit an increase in the [Ca2+]i, fixed, and stained with antibodies for a cis-Golgi marker (golgin 97) or a nuclear membrane marker (nucleoporin 62). An increase in EGFP-FL fluorescence in a juxtanuclear position 45 s after treatment with 100 µm ATP was observed in >90% of cells (Fig.2 A) and overlapped completely with a region identified by the cis-Golgi marker (Fig. 2,B and C). As a comparison with the physiological agonist and with previously published cPLA2 localization studies, we also used high dose ionophore as an agonist.

https://openalex.org/W2057414105,"The Ran guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) controls nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle formation, and nuclear envelope assembly. These functions rely on the association of the Ran-specific exchange factor, RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1), with chromatin. We find that RCC1 binds directly to mononucleosomes and to histones H2A and H2B. RCC1 utilizes these histones to bind Xenopus sperm chromatin, and the binding of RCC1 to nucleosomes or histones stimulates the catalytic activity of RCC1. We propose that the docking of RCC1 to H2A/H2B establishes the polarity of the Ran-GTP gradient that drives nuclear envelope assembly, nuclear transport, and other nuclear events."
https://openalex.org/W1980409596,"A fossil from the Early Jurassic (Sinemurian, approximately 195 million years ago) represents a new lineage of mammaliaforms, the extinct groups more closely related to the living mammals than to nonmammaliaform cynodonts. It has an enlarged cranial cavity, but no postdentary trough on the mandible, indicating separation of the middle ear bones from the mandible. This extends the earliest record of these crucial mammalian features by some 45 million years and suggests that separation of the middle ear bones from the mandible and the expanded brain vault could be correlated. It shows that several key mammalian evolutionary innovations in the ear region, the temporomandibular joint, and the brain vault evolved incrementally through mammaliaform evolution and long before the differentiation of the living mammal groups. With an estimated body weight of only 2 grams, its coexistence with other larger mammaliaforms with similar ""triconodont-like"" teeth for insectivory within the same fauna suggests a great trophic diversity within the mammaliaform insectivore feeding guild, as inferred from the range of body sizes."
https://openalex.org/W1965544850,"Arthropod hemocyanins and phenoloxidases serve different physiological functions as oxygen transporters and enzymes involved in defense reactions, respectively. However, they are equipped with a structurally similar oxygen-binding center. We have shown that the clotting enzyme of the horseshoe crab, <i>Tachypleus tridentatus</i>, functionally converts hemocyanin to phenoloxidase by forming a complex without proteolytic cleavage (Nagai, T., and Kawabata, S. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 275, 35297–35301). Here we show that chitin-binding antimicrobial peptides of the horseshoe crab induce the intrinsic phenoloxidase activity of hemocyanin. Tachyplesin, a major <i>Tachypleus</i> antimicrobial peptide with an amphiphilic structure, converted the hemocyanin to phenoloxidase. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed the specific interaction of tachyplesin with hemocyanin at <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> = 3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>6</sup>m. The chemical modification of Trp or Tyr in tachyplesin, but not Lys or Arg, dramatically reduced the affinity to hemocyanin, suggesting that the binding site is located in the hydrophobic face of tachyplesin. Hemocyanin has no affinity with chitin, but it significantly binds to tachyplesin-coated chitin, leading to the expression of phenoloxidase activity. The chitin coated with antimicrobial peptides may serve as a scaffold for the binding of hemocyanin, and the resulting phenoloxidase activity appears to function as a trigger of exoskeleton wound healing."

https://openalex.org/W2099921758,"Abstract Nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and its metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) play a crucial role in the induction of lung cancer, and NNAL-O-glucuronide formation and elimination are important steps in detoxification of these compounds. In the present study, we investigated the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein, MRP1 (ABCC1), as a candidate transporter responsible for NNAL-O-glucuronide export. MRP1 mediates the active transport of numerous GSH-, sulfate-, and glucuronide-conjugated organic anions and can transport certain xenobiotics by a mechanism that may involve co-transport with GSH. Using membrane vesicles prepared from transfected cells, we found that MRP1 transports [3H]NNAL-O-glucuronide but is dependent on the presence of GSH (K m 39 μm, V max 48 pmol mg−1 min−1). We also found that the sulfur atom in GSH was dispensable because transport was supported by the GSH analog, γ-glutamyl-α-aminobutyryl-glycine. Despite stimulation of NNAL-O-glucuronide transport by GSH, there was no detectable reciprocal stimulation of [3H]GSH transport. Moreover, whereas the MRP1 substrates leukotriene C4(LTC4) and 17β-estradiol 17β-(d-glucuronide) (E217βG) inhibited GSH-dependent uptake of [3H]NNAL-O-glucuronide, only [3H]LTC4 transport was inhibited by NNAL-O-glucuronide (+GSH) and the kinetics of inhibition were complex. A mutant form of MRP1, which transports LTC4but not E217βG, also did not transport NNAL-O-glucuronide suggesting a commonality in the binding elements for these two glucuronidated substrates, despite their lack of reciprocal transport inhibition. Finally, the related MRP2 transported NNAL-O-glucuronide with higher efficiency than MRP1 and unexpectedly, GSH inhibited rather than stimulated uptake. These studies provide further insight into the complex interactions of the MRP-related proteins with GSH and their conjugated organic anion substrates, and extend the range of xenotoxins transported by MRP1 and MRP2 to include metabolites of known carcinogens involved in the etiology of lung and other cancers."

Together, these data indicate that the Cbl proteins are important regulators of intracellular signaling and consequently of cell function and development. Cbl proteins are negative regulators of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. This was first shown by genetic studies inCaenorhabditis elegans, which demonstrated that Sli-1 (theC. elegans Cbl homologue) is a negative regulator of the Let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase (the EGFR homologue) in vulva development (3Yoon C.H.

Genetics. 1995; 139: 1553-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila Cbl protein (D-Cbl) has been shown to associate with the EGFR, and overexpression of D-Cbl in the eye of Drosophila embryos inhibits EGFR-dependent photoreceptor cell development (4Hime G.R.

Several studies have shown that mammalian Cbl proteins become phosphorylated and recruited to the EGFR upon stimulation (11Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Ota S. Douillard P.

Cbl proteins function as ubiquitin protein ligases, which mediate the ubiquitination of activated tyrosine kinases including the EGFR and target them for degradation (20Ettenberg S.A. Rubinstein Y.R.

Ubiquitination of proteins occurs via the sequential activation and conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) (32Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6829) Google Scholar). The E3 confers specificity to the ubiquitination process. An increasing number of RING finger proteins has been demonstrated to function as E3 proteins or as part of E3 complexes, and in each of them the RING finger is essential to this activity (33Honda R.

The highly conserved TKB and RING finger domains of Cbl proteins are essential and sufficient for their E3 activity, and together these domains target the ubiquitination of activated tyrosine kinases such as the EGFR (20–31). Here, we show that EGF activation induces a coordinated degradation of the EGFR, Cbl proteins, and other proteins of the EGFR signaling complex. These results suggest that Cbl proteins regulate degradation of multiple proteins in the active EGFR-signaling complex. The expression plasmid for HA epitope-tagged Cbl-b, c-Cbl, and the control vector (pCEFL) have been previously described (18Ettenberg S.A. Keane M.M. Nau M.M. Frankel M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1855-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged Cbl-b N1/3 (amino acids 1–349) and C2/3 (327) were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning into the pCEFL vector. The N-terminal half (N1/2) of Cbl-b (amino acids 1–483) was created by deleting the C-terminal of the full-length wild type Cbl-b in pCEFL, and in the process the HA epitope was lost. The GST fusion protein for Cbl-b N1/2 (amino acids 29–483) was created by in-frame cloning of a polymerase chain reaction-generated N-terminal fragment of Cbl-b into pGEX 2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The C373A was created in both the full-length wild type Cbl-b in pCEFL and in the GST-Cbl-b N1/2 fusion protein by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene). All of the mutant Cbl-b constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The EGFR Y1045F mutant expression construct in pcDNA3 has been previously described (26Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

The GFP expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1/zeo) was obtained from Invitrogen. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (18Ettenberg S.A. Keane M.M. Nau M.M. Frankel M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1855-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Anti-Akt (New England Biolabs), anti-Cbl-b (H454; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EGFR (1005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ERK-2 antibody (SC154; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Grb-2 (C-23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (06–195; Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-Shc (Transduction Laboratories, Inc.) were used for immunoblotting. Ubiquitination was assayed as previously described using a rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (44Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen J.P. Nguygen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Ab-3; Oncogene Science) and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation. MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Stable clones overexpressing wild type and mutant forms of Cbl-b were generated as previously described (20Ettenberg S.A. Rubinstein Y.R. Banerjee P. Nau M.M. Keane M.M. Lipkowitz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To measure the biochemical effects of EGF stimulation, MDA-MB-468 cells were grown to 50–70% confluence, starved overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml; Collaborative Biomedical Products) for the times indicated. To harvest proteins, the cells were washed two times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (Complete tabs®, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. In experiments to rule out sequestration of Cbl-b upon EGF stimulation, the cells were lysed in SDS buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 µmdithiothreitol), boiled for 5 min, sonicated, and then run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels without clarification of the lysates. To assess the biochemical effects in the presence of protease inhibitors (e.g. lactacystin, NH4Cl, or Z-VAD-fmk), cells were starved as above, the protease inhibitor was added 2 h before EGF, and lysates were prepared as above. To induce apoptosis in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, cells were incubated with the combination of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and doxorubicin as previously described (45Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Russell E.K. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 734-741PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and transfected with various constructs using calcium phosphate (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) according to the protocol included with the reagents. To measure the effects of EGF stimulation, 293T cells were grown to 70% confluence, starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the times indicated. Proteins were harvested as describe above for MDA-MB-468 cells. Autoubiquitination of Cbl proteins was performed as previously described (40Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant wheat E2 (20 ng; UbcH5B) along with recombinant wheat E1 (20 ng) and 32P-Labeled ubiquitin (2 × 104 cpm), in ubiquitination buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm adenosine 5′-triphosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction mixture was separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized with a Storm PhosphorImager and Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). After exposure, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure that similar amounts of GST fusion proteins had been used. In prior work, we demonstrated that overexpressing Cbl-b in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line enhances EGF-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the EGFR (20Ettenberg S.A. Rubinstein Y.R. Banerjee P. Nau M.M. Keane M.M. Lipkowitz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This results in inhibition of EGFR function. During further investigations of activation-induced down-regulation of the EGFR by Cbl-b in these MDA-MB-468 cells, we observed that there was an activation-induced loss of Cbl-b that parallels the decrease in the EGFR (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–7). In the absence of Cbl-b, the EGFR showed only minimal degradation (Fig. 1 A, lanes 8–14). Cbl-b degradation did not reflect a general decrease of cellular proteins, as Akt and ERK-2 protein levels did not change. These results were confirmed in multiple independent Cbl-b and vector clones. This change in protein level was not due to changes in mRNA, as the level of exogenous Cbl-b mRNA, measured by Northern analysis, was stable throughout the time course of the experiment (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate that the observed decrease in Cbl-b protein represented a loss of protein and not sequestration in an insoluble compartment, cell lysates were prepared from EGF-starved and stimulated cells by resuspending the cells in a 2% SDS lysing buffer, boiling, and then sonicating the lysates. The lysates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels without clarification. In these lysates, Cbl-b protein levels still were observed to decrease upon EGF stimulation (Fig.1 C). Clones of the MDA-MBA-468 cell line, which expressed higher levels of Cbl-b, demonstrated progressively less EGF-induced down-regulation of Cbl-b (Fig. 2 A). This suggested that the mechanism of EGF-induced down-regulation of Cbl-b is saturable. When high levels of Cbl-b are expressed (as in clone B.29), EGF induces down-regulation of only a small fraction of the total Cbl-b. Thus, changes in the Cbl-b protein level are not appreciated in the highest expressors. In contrast, all of the Cbl-b clones down-regulated the EGFR to an equal degree as the clone shown in Fig. 1(data not shown). This indicates that even the lowest expressing clone has sufficient Cbl-b to effectively target the EGFR for degradation. These observations further suggest that there might be a stoichiometric relationship between the levels of Cbl-b, the EGFR, and the down-regulation of both proteins. To test whether levels of each protein (EGFR and Cbl-b) affected the degradation of the other, a constant amount of the EGFR was co-expressed in 293T cells with varying amounts of Cbl-b (Fig.2 B). When 3.0 µg of Cbl-b plasmid was transfected along with 1.0 µg of the EGFR plasmid, no EGF-induced decrease in Cbl-b was observed despite down-regulation of the EGFR (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, when 0.3 µg of Cbl-b plasmid was transfected along with 1.0 µg of the EGFR plasmid, EGF induced a decrease in the Cbl-b protein but no decrease in the EGFR (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). When the expression of both proteins is titrated optimally, EGF-induced down-regulation of both proteins was observed (Fig. 2 C;lane 4). In addition, to determine whether EGF induced a similar down-regulation of c-Cbl, c-Cbl and EGFR were transiently co-expressed in 293T cells. Activation-induced down-regulation of c-Cbl and the EGFR was observed (Fig. 2 C; lane 8). Varying the amounts of c-Cbl and the EGFR plasmids transfected yielded results similar to the titration of Cbl-b presented in Fig.2 B (data not shown). When the EGFR or the Cbl proteins were expressed alone in 293T cells, EGF did not induce down-regulation of the respective transfected proteins (Fig. 2 C; lanes 2, 6, and 10). To test if EGF induced degradation of endogenous Cbl proteins, MDA-MB-468 cells were stimulated with EGF, lysates were prepared, and protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 D). EGF induced degradation of the endogenous c-Cbl and Cbl-b (Fig.2 D, lane 2). In these cells there was only slight degradation of the EGFR. This result is concordant with the titration data described above (Fig. 2, A–C), since these cells have high levels of the EGFR and relatively low levels of endogenous Cbl proteins. These results confirmed that EGF induces degradation of endogenous Cbl proteins and further confirmed the stoichiometric relationship described above. Degradation of activated EGFRs is sensitive to both proteasome and lysosome inhibitors (22Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 46Galcheva-Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar,47Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Thus, EGFR degradation is dependent on both the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. To test if Cbl-b degradation occurred by a mechanism similar to that of EGFR degradation, MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing Cbl-b were stimulated with EGF in the presence or absence of lactacystin (an inhibitor of proteasomes (48Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar)). Lactacystin inhibited EGF-induced degradation of both Cbl-b and the EGFR proteins but had little or no effect on the level of the proteins in the absence of EGF simulation (Fig. 3 A;top panels). Similar inhibition of EGF-induced degradation was seen when cells were incubated with inhibitors of lysosome function (e.g. ammonium chloride (47Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar)) (data not shown). In contrast, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk did not block EGF-induced degradation of Cbl-b or the EGFR (Fig. 3 A; bottom panels). Cbl proteins have been shown to be degraded during apoptosis (49Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the combination of TRAIL and doxorubicin induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells, and this can be blocked by caspase inhibitors (45Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Russell E.K. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 734-741PubMed Google Scholar). Z-VAD-fmk inhibited the degradation of Cbl-b and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which occurs during apoptosis (Fig. 3 B). These inhibitor experiments suggest that EGF induces a common degradation pathway for both Cbl-b and the EGFR involving both the proteasome and the lysosome. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the degradation of Cbl-b induced by EGF occurs via a distinct mechanism from the degradation seen during apoptosis. The EGFR is targeted for degradation by activation-induced ubiquitination mediated by the Cbl proteins (20Ettenberg S.A. Rubinstein Y.R. Banerjee P. Nau M.M. Keane M.M. Lipkowitz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y.

To test if Cbl-b is also ubiquitinated, Cbl-b was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates starved or stimulated with EGF in the presence of lactacystin and then immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 4). In cells overexpressing Cbl-b, EGF activation results in the appearance of a smear of anti-ubiquitin immunoreactive species in the Cbl-b immunoprecipitates, indicative of the addition of multiple ubiquitin molecules to Cbl-b (Fig. 4; lane 4). Similarly, EGF induced ubiquitination of the EGFR (Fig. 4, lane 8). Notably, the ubiquitinated forms of Cbl-b begin at a smaller size (∼125 kDa) than the un-ubiquitinated EGFR (∼180 kDa), indicating that the higher molecular mass ubiquitinated proteins are not co-precipitating ubiquitinated EGFRs. Similarly, the ubiquitinated species detected in the EGFR immunoprecipitates migrate above the position of the un-ubiquitinated EGFR (Fig. 4, lane 8). Thus, Cbl-b becomes ubiquitinated upon EGF activation. The ability of Cbl proteins to induce ubiquitination and degradation of activated EGFRs requires an intact TKB and RING finger domain (23Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

To assess the structural requirements for Cbl-b ubiquitination and degradation, stable clones of the MDA-MB-468 cell line expressing mutant forms of Cbl-b were generated. EGF activation of cells expressing full-length Cbl-b or the Cbl-b N1/2 (which contains both the TKB and RING finger domains) resulted in down-regulation of both the Cbl-b and EGFR proteins (Fig.5 A). Both of these forms of Cbl-b are recruited to the EGFR upon activation. These results also demonstrate that proline-rich SH3 docking sites and the ubiquitin-associated domain in the C-terminal half of Cbl-b are not required for Cbl-b or EGFR down-regulation.

Chelation of intracellular Ca2+, using 1,2-bis (o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxy- methyl) ester (BAPTA-AM), resulted in >95% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The calmodulin antagonist, W13, inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 60%. Both BAPTA-AM and W13 inhibited Akt phosphorylation by 70–75%. However, analysis of insulin-dose response curves indicated that this inhibition was not sufficient to explain the effects of BAPTA-AM and W13 on glucose uptake. BAPTA-AM inhibited insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 by 50%, as determined by plasma membrane lawn assay and subcellular fractionation. In contrast, the insulin-stimulated appearance of HA-tagged GLUT4 at the cell surface, as measured by surface binding, was blocked by BAPTA-AM. While the ionophores A23187 or ionomycin prevented the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation by BAPTA-AM, they did not overcome the inhibition of glucose transport. Moreover, glucose uptake of cells pretreated with insulin followed by rapid cooling to 4 °C, to promote cell surface expression of GLUT4 and prevent subsequent endocytosis, was inhibited specifically by BAPTA-AM. This indicates that inhibition of glucose uptake by BAPTA-AM is independent of both trafficking and signal transduction. These data indicate that Ca2+ is involved in at least two different steps of the insulin-dependent recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. One involves the translocation step. The second involves the fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+/calmodulin plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic vesicle docking and fusion. Finally, BAPTA-AM may inhibit the activity of the facilitative transporters by binding directly to the transporter itself.

In recent years considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the downstream signal transduction pathways that are activated by insulin to mediate the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Upon insulin binding, the activated insulin receptor (IR)1 tyrosine kinase phosphorylates a number of downstream substrates, most notably the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family of proteins, including IRS-1 and IRS-2 (1White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2 serve as docking stations for SH2 domain-containing proteins such as the class Ia (p85/p110-type) PI 3-kinase (1White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase is essential for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake (2Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) with generation of phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate at the plasma membrane (PM) (3Oatey P.B. Venkateswarlu K.

Recent evidence indicates that the pleckstrin homology domain-containing Ser/Thr kinase Akt (otherwise called protein kinase B) plays a fundamental role in mediating insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (4Kohn A.D.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A direct link between the insulin-signaling cascade and the more distal events associated with GLUT4 trafficking is yet to be identified. The precise nature of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage vesicle (GSV) and a detailed molecular description of how insulin promotes translocation of the GSV to the PM remain to be defined. In contrast, the mechanism by which GSVs dock and fuse with the PM is better understood, in part because of the similarity with synaptic vesicle trafficking in neurons. Both of these events involve the pairing of protein complexes in the vesicle compartment (v-SNARES, forvesicle membrane SNAP receptors) with cognate receptor complexes at the target membrane (t-SNARES, fortarget membrane SNAP receptors). Interactions between v-SNARE and t-SNARE proteins, as well as additional accessory proteins, are responsible for formation of the core complex, which is required for membrane docking and fusion (7Mayer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In adipocytes the core complex is comprised of the v-SNARE, VAMP2, and the t-SNAREs, syntaxin 4 and SNAP23 (8Rea S. James D. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the similarity in molecular regulation between GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes and synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons, it has been suggested that GLUT4 translocation may represent a form of regulated exocytosis. Most regulated exocytic processes share several characteristic features. These include segregation of the cargo to be transported, increased delivery of this cargo to the cell surface in response to secretagogue, and the involvement of Ca2+ in the delivery process. Although numerous studies have examined the role of Ca2+ in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, there remains little consensus concerning its overall role in this process. Investigations in L6 muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, and adipocytes failed to find a clear link between Ca2+ and glucose metabolism (9Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E297-E304PubMed Google Scholar, 10Klip A. Ramlal T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9141-9146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kelly K.L. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol.

In contrast, reduction of intracellular Ca2+ in rat adipocytes markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport (13Draznin B. Sussman K. Kao M. Lewis D. Sherman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14385-14388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pershadsingh H.A. Shade D.L. Delfert D.M. McDonald J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ca2+ may play a permissive role, or it may actively drive one or more of the steps involved in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking. In the latter case insulin may increase cytosolic Ca2+ by regulating the activity of a Ca2+channel. In the former case there may be no change in cytosolic Ca2+ with insulin stimulation. Intuitively one might imagine at least two loci where Ca2+ might be involved in mediating the effects of insulin on glucose uptake. Firstly, Ca2+/calmodulin has been implicated in mediating insulin activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt in rat hepatocytes and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Benzeroual K. Pandey S.K. Srivastava A.K. van de Werve G. Haddad P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Yang C. Watson R.T. Elmendorf J.S. Sacks D.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Secondly, several recent studies have reported a key role for Ca2+/calmodulin in the late stages of vesicle docking/fusion (18Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 19Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J.

Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ could be required both for the proximal signaling events of the insulin cascade and/or in the final stages of docking of GSVs with the plasma membrane. In the present investigation we have re-evaluated the role of Ca2+ in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To do this we have employed the membrane permeable form of the Ca2+-chelating agent BAPTA-AM and the calmodulin antagonist W13. BAPTA-AM and W13 reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 95 and 60% and Akt phosphorylation by 75 and 70%, respectively. BAPTA-AM reduced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane by 50% as determined by subcellular fractionation analyses. However, by using an antibody binding assay that measured insertion of glucose transporters into the membrane, we observed almost 100% inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in response to BAPTA-AM. We also found that treatment with ionophores prevented the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation by BAPTA-AM. These data indicate that Ca2+/calmodulin is required for the efficient activation of Akt and are consistent with an obligate role for Ca2+ at a late post-docking stage in GLUT4 vesicle fusion.

James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells stably overexpressing the IR (CHO.IR cells) were cultured as described previously (25Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In all experiments cells were serum-starved in Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for at least 2 h at 37 °C, and all further treatments were performed in the same buffer except where insulin stimulation and 2-DOG uptake were carried out in KRP buffer without Ca2+. In these experiments cells were rinsed in prewarmed KRP buffer as described above, except that it was without CaCl2 and supplemented with 5 mm EGTA, and incubated in this buffer for the duration of insulin stimulation and 2-DOG uptake. Where indicated, cells were incubated with BAPTA-AM (50 µm, made up in Me2SO) for 10 min followed by insulin (1 µm) for 15 min at 37 °C in the continued presence of BAPTA-AM. Incubation of cells in KRP with 0.2% BSA supplemented with 3 mm pyruvate gave comparable results (data not shown). In other experiments, cells were incubated with W13 (70 µm (17Yang C. Watson R.T. Elmendorf J.S. Sacks D.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), made up in H2O) for 20 min followed by insulin (1 µm) for 15 min at 37 °C in the continued presence of W13. In experiments to investigate the effects of BAPTA-AM on glucose uptake post-insulin treatment, cells were incubated with insulin (1 µm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Following this, cells were rapidly cooled to 4 °C by washing with ice-cold KRP and incubated in the same buffer on ice. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C in the absence or the presence of BAPTA-AM, BAPTA, or EGTA-AM (all at 50 µm) or W13 (70 µm) for the times indicated, such that all cells were incubated at 4 °C for the same duration. In experiments involving the ionophores, A23187 or ionomycin (0.1 µm, made up in MeOH) was added simultaneously to the addition of BAPTA-AM. Treatment of cells with vehicle alone or in combination (at the appropriate final concentrations) was without effect in control experiments (data not shown). Following incubation with the appropriate agents, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with ice-cold HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) and homogenized in the same buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmtetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 250 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Subcellular fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation as previously detailed (25Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or by a modified protocol that gave comparable results. The modified protocol differed from that described (25Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) in the preparation of the PM fraction. In brief, centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min was performed to remove mitochondria, nuclei, and unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the crude PM fraction. This pellet was resuspended in HES buffer containing inhibitors and centrifuged again at 2,000 × g for 10 min to remove contaminating material. The supernatant from this was then centrifuged again at 18,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the PM fraction. The high speed pellet (otherwise termed low density microsomal fraction) was prepared from the supernatant from the first 18,000 × g spin as described (25Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The protein content of all samples was determined using BCA reagent. The samples (10 µg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), and the membranes were probed with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Supersignal, Pierce). The protein bands were quantified by densitometry (GS-700 Imaging densitometer, Bio-Rad) using nonsaturated exposed x-ray films. 2-Deoxy-[3H]glucose uptake was measured as described previously (26Clark S.F. Molero J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3819-3826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 12-well plates were incubated in the absence or the presence of compounds, as indicated, in 500 µl of KRP with 0.2% BSA. The assay was initiated by adding 50 µl of 1 mm2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (20 µCi/mmol)/KRP and terminated after 1–2 min by washing cells rapidly three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, and 3H was quantitated by scintillation counting (Packard 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer, Packard Instrument Co.). Glucose uptake was measured in duplicate in all treatments. Nonspecific uptake of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose was determined by the addition of cytochalasin B (50 µm) to the appropriate controls prior to the commencement of assays. Measurement of the transport of the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 3-O-[methyl-3H]glucose was performed essentially as described above except that the assay was terminated after 45 s by washing cells three times in ice-cold PBS containing phloretin (100 µm). The PM lawn assay was performed essentially as described (27Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In brief, 3T3-L1 adipocytes grown on glass coverslips were treated as indicated and then sonicated using a probe sonicator (Kontes Co., Vineland, NJ) to generate a lawn of PM fragments attached to the coverslip. The coverslips were then incubated in GLUT4-specific antiserum, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted onto glass microscope slides, and viewed using a 63×/1.4 Zeiss oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal imaging system. Duplicate coverslips were prepared for each condition, and six random images of PM lawn were collected from each. The images were quantified using NIH 1.62 software. An exofacial HA epitope-tagged GLUT4 construct containing a single HA epitope in the first exofacial loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Quon, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was inserted into the retroviral expression vector pBabepuro and used to generate 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing HA-GLUT4 as described (23Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Following treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing HA-GLUT4 cells were rinsed once in ice-cold PBS and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde with PBS for 15 min. Excess fixative was neutralized with 0.15 m glycine with PBS and blocked using 1% BSA with PBS for 30 min. The coverslips were incubated in anti-HA antibody (16B12) in 1% BSA with PBS for 1 h followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody in 1% BSA with PBS for 30 min. The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted onto glass microscope slides, and viewed as described above. 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing HA-GLUT4 were grown in 24-well plates. Following the appropriate treatment cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde with PBS for five min. The cells were blocked in 2.5% normal swine serum with PBS for 30 min and then incubated in anti-HA antibody (16B12 at 1:500) in 1% normal swine serum with PBS or 1% normal swine serum with PBS alone as a control for 60 min. After washing in 0.1% BSA with PBS (3 times for 10 min each time), the cells were incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000) in 2.5% normal rat serum with PBS for 30 min. The cells were then washed in PBS (3 × 10 min) followed by incubation ino-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent made up according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) for 30 min in the dark. Finally, the A of the supernatant was read at 450 nm. The data were normalized to the insulin response detected in the same experiment and are expressed as percentages of the average insulin effect observed. The significance of various treatments was determined using the Student's ttest. For reasons of clarity, statistical significance, or lack thereof, between parameters is detailed only in situations pertinent to the discussion. It has been suggested that extracellular Ca2+ may play a role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes (13Draznin B. Sussman K. Kao M. Lewis D. Sherman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14385-14388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this we observed a 30% decrease in insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake when cells were incubated in Ca2+ free buffer supplemented with 5 mm EGTA (Fig. 1A). To further investigate the role of Ca2+ in this process we performed experiments using the membrane-permeable form of BAPTA, namely BAPTA-AM, which is freely taken up into cells where it is hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases and trapped intracellularly as the active chelator BAPTA. This reagent exchanges Ca2+ more than 100 times faster than other agents such as EGTA, because of the faster rates of association and dissociation. Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with BAPTA-AM for 10 min resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake with an IC50 of 15 µm (Fig. 1 B). In all further experiments we used a BAPTA-AM concentration of 50 µm, at which we observed almost complete (>95%) inhibition of insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 1 C). BAPTA-AM also caused significant inhibition of basal 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 1 C). Identical results were obtained when cells were treated with BAPTA-AM in Ca2+-free buffer (basal, 10% ± 2; BAPTA-AM, 6% ± 1; insulin, 100%; insulin + BAPTA-AM, 9% ± 2; n = 4). Moreover, the nonesterified form of BAPTA or EGTA-AM had no significant effect on basal (control, 10% ± 2; BAPTA, 11% ± 3; EGTA-AM, 12% ± 2; n = 3) or insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake (control, 100%; BAPTA, 102% ± 5; EGTA-AM, 97% ± 3; n = 3). The inhibitory effect of BAPTA-AM did not involve an effect on intracellular ATP levels or hexokinase activity because it also inhibited insulin-stimulated transport of the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 3-O-methylglucose (Fig. 1 D). We next examined the effects of BAPTA-AM on GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface using the PM lawn assay (Fig. 2). The morphology of the plasma membrane fragments was unaffected by BAPTA-AM. Insulin increased the level of GLUT4 at the PM by 4–5-fold. Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 levels in the PM lawns by ∼ 50%. It has previously been reported that BAPTA-AM has no effect on GLUT4 translocation using this assay (28Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, quantitation of GLUT4 in PM lawns was not performed in that study, in which case it is conceivable that a 50% inhibition may have been overlooked. To further investigate the apparent inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by BAPTA-AM, we examined its effects on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by subcellular fractionation using differential centrifugation and immunoblotting (Fig.3). In the absence of insulin very little GLUT4 was detected in the PM fraction obtained from basal cells. Consistent with the PM lawn data, insulin treatment resulted in a 5-fold increase in GLUT4 levels within the PM fraction (Fig. 3). Although BAPTA-AM alone had no significant effect on GLUT4 translocation, it caused a significant reduction (∼ 50%) in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Moreover, insulin-stimulated translocation of the insulin responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP), which shows virtually identical trafficking properties to GLUT4 (29Garza L.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was similarly inhibited by BAPTA-AM (Fig. 3 A). The above data suggest that although BAPTA-AM caused almost quantitative inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, this reagent inhibited GLUT4 translocation by only 50%. This discrepancy is unlikely to reflect a technical limitation of our ability to quantify GLUT4 translocation because we observed quantitatively similar results using two different fractionation techniques. In view of recent findings implicating a role for Ca2+ at a post-docking step in vesicle transport (7Mayer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we reasoned that in the presence of BAPTA-AM, GSVs may dock at the PM but be blocked in their ability to fuse with the cell surface. Such docked vesicles may remain attached to the PM during preparation of PM fractions by the lawn technique or by subcellular fractionation, but because they have not fused with the cell surface they may not contribute to glucose entry into the cell. To examine this possibility we developed a surface binding assay utilizing 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing an exofacial tagged HA-GLUT4 construct (23Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This assay will only detect GLUT4 if it has inserted into the cell surface lipid bilayer, thus providing an estimate of vesicle docking and fusion. In the absence of insulin, we observed no detectable labeling of the cell surface using the anti-HA antibody in cells expressing HA-GLUT4 (Fig.4A). In insulin-treated cells we observed a marked increase in surface labeling of most cells in the culture (Fig. 4 A). Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM resulted in complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface (Fig. 4 A). To obtain more quantitative data we performed further experiments where the cell surface expression of HA-GLUT4 was quantified using a colorimetric assay (Fig. 4 B) (30Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, pretreatment with BAPTA-AM resulted in an almost total inhibition of insulin-stimulated cell surface expression of HA-GLUT4. These data implicate a role for Ca2+ in the fusion of GSVs with the plasma membrane and potentially resolve the discrepancy between the effects of BAPTA-AM on glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation as measured by the PM lawn technique or differential centrifugation (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The above data implicate a role for Ca2+ at two different stages of the GLUT4 translocation process. Firstly, BAPTA-AM was shown to inhibit the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface by ∼50%. Secondly, BAPTA-AM blocked the apparent insertion of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane. Collectively, these two effects may account for the almost complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by BAPTA-AM. The first effect of BAPTA-AM may involve a limitation in the availability of docking or fusion sites at the plasma membrane or an additional inhibitory effect of BAPTA-AM at a step between insulin binding to its receptor and that of GLUT4 docking at the PM. Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated t"
https://openalex.org/W2014440450,"1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase is a key enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway. Recent studies raise the possibility that 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) is regulated not only transcriptionally but also post-translationally. To elucidate post-translational ACS regulation, we analyzed the modification of LE-ACS2 protein, a wound-inducible isozyme in the ACS family, in tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) using an anti-LE-ACS2 antibody. We detected phosphorylated LE-ACS2 at 55-kDa using immunoprecipitation from an extract of wounded fruit fed with [32P]inorganic phosphate. Analysis of LE-ACS2 phosphoamino acids indicated that serine residue(s) were phosphorylated. In vitro phosphorylation analyses using site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant LE-ACS2 as a substrate demonstrate that serine 460 located at the C-terminal region of ACS is phosphorylated. During tomato ripening stages, expression of bothLE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 mRNA increased. LE-ACS4, however, was not phosphorylated in vitro. These results suggest that ACS isozymes have different post-translational regulatory mechanisms, such as phosphorylation. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase is a key enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway.

S-adenosyl-l-methionine 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ACC synthase pyridoxal 5′-phosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Coomassie Brilliant Blue protein phosphatase 2A λ protein phosphatase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Ethylene influences numerous plant growth and developmental processes (1Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Saltveit Jr., M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). Ethylene is biosynthesized from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)1 via 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). The rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis is the conversion of AdoMet to ACC (2Adams D.O. Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 170-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This step is catalyzed by ACC synthase (ACS; EC 4.4.1.14), which is encoded by a multigene family (3Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The ACS genes have been cloned from various species, and their expression patterns have been studied. Distinct subsets of ACS genes are expressed in response to various developmental, environmental, and hormonal factors (3Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 4Zarembinski T.I. Theologis A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1579-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Increases in ACS activity under various conditions correlate with increased levels of ACS mRNA, as shown by Northern blot or RNase protection assays, suggesting that ACS is transcriptionally regulated (3Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Some reports, however, suggest the possibility that ACS is also regulated post-transcriptionally or post-translationally. Unspliced and spliced LE-ACS3accumulate in flooded tomato roots (5Olson D.C. Oetiker J.H. Yang S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14056-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In cell suspension cultures, cycloheximide suppresses the increase of ACS activity induced by stress, whereas cordycepin and actinomycin D do not (6Chappell J. Hahlbrock K. Boller T. Planta. 1984; 161: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Felix G. Grosskopf D.G. Regenass M. Basse C.W. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In other reports, the accumulation of ACS transcripts did not correlate with ACS activity or the rate of ethylene production. This phenomenon was observed in tomato suspension cells treated with elicitor (8Oetiker J.H. Olson D.C. Shiu O.Y. Yang S.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in etiolated seedlings of Arabidopsis mutantseto1 and eto3, which produce elevated levels of ethylene (9Woeste K.E. Ye C. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and in cytokinin-treated Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings (10Vogel J.P. Woeste K.E. Theologis A. Kieber J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms underlying post-transcriptional regulation of ACS genes are still unknown, possible mechanisms of the post-translational regulation of ACS proteins include modifications of ACS that result in a change in activity or stability and mechanism-based inactivation of ACS by the substrate AdoMet (11Satoh S. Yang S.F. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1036-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on previous studies (12Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li N. Huxtable S. Yang S.F. Kung S.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), one possible modification of ACS is a truncation of the C-terminal region, which increases enzyme activity. In previous studies, the molecular masses of some purified ACS isozymes were smaller than those of the in vitro translation products (14Nakajima N. Nakagawa N. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 989-998Google Scholar, 15Sato T. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6621-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Edelman L. Kende H. Planta. 1990; 182: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and smaller than those of ACSs expressed in Escherichia coli harboring ACS cDNA (17Van der Straeten D. Van Wiemeersch L. Goodman H.M. Van Montagu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4859-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Sato T. Oeller P.W. Theologis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, proteolysis of ACS was thought to occur during extraction and purification from plants. Deletion of 52 amino acid residues from the C terminus of ACS increased enzymatic activity (12Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas deletion of the first 27 amino acid residues from the N terminus of ACS completely abolished ACS activity (13Li N. Huxtable S. Yang S.F. Kung S.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these results, ACSs are thought to be cleaved at the C-terminal region and proteolytic processing of this region to increase enzymatic activity. There is no experimental evidence, however, that this regulation occurs in vivo. ACS might also be modified by protein phosphorylation. In tomato suspension cells, a protein kinase inhibitor, K-252a, blocked elicitor-induced ACS activity, and a protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, induced a rapid increase in ACS activity in the absence of elicitors and accelerated the rate of increase of elicitor-inducible ACS activity (19Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An attempt to detect phosphorylated ACS by immunoprecipitation, however, was unsuccessful. Thus, Spanu et al. (19Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested that protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation was involved in the regulation of ACS not by regulating the catalytic activity but by controlling the rate of enzyme turnover. Tuomainenet al. (20Tuomainen J. Betz C. Kangasjarvi J. Ernst D. Yin Z.-H. Langebartels C. Sandermann Jr., H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1151-1162Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) observed the same phenomenon in ozone-exposed tomato leaves and suggested that protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulated ACS activity. These results were obtained using only inhibitors. Therefore, it is still unknown whether ACS was directly phosphorylated or whether other proteins that control ACS activity or stability were phosphorylated. To understand post-translational ACS regulation, we used the wound-inducible isozyme in tomato, LE-ACS2, and an anti-LE-ACS2 antibody. Crude extracts from wounded tomato fruit fed with [32P]Pi were immunoprecipitated. We report here that LE-ACS2 is phosphorylated at Ser-460 at the C-terminal region in wounded tomato fruit. This is the first report to directly demonstrate the phosphorylation of ACS at the molecular level. Tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Super First) was obtained from a local market or harvested at the Aichi Agricultural Research Center. Wounded tissues were prepared by slicing pericarp tissues (1.0 × 0.3 × 0.3 cm3) and incubating them for 3 h at 25 °C. The following sets of primers were used for polymerase chain reaction to amplify DNA fragments of LE-ACS2, -3, and -4. LE-ACS2 wild-type, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGATTTGAGATTGCA-3′), antisense (5′-TTCCTCGAGGCTAAGACAAATTATGATGTC-3′); LE-ACS2 mutant deletion C terminus, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGATTTGAGATTGCA-3′), antisense (5′-ATTCCTCGAGTTAACTTTTCTCAACACCTACGA-3′); LE-ACS2mutant S460G, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGATTTGAGATTGCA-3′), antisense (5′-CTTTTCGAAAAACCAAGTCTCAAATTATTC-3′), sense (5′-GAATAATTTGAGACTTGGTTTTTCGAAAAG-3′), antisense (5′-TTCCTCGAGGCTAAGACAAATTATGATGTC-3′); LE-ACS2 mutant S462G, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGATTTGAGATTGCA-3′), antisense (5′-CTTTTCCCAAAACTAAGTCTCAAATTATTC-3′), sense (5′-GAATAATTTGAGACTTAGTTTTGGGAAAAG-3′), antisense (5′-TTCCTCGAGGCTAAGACAAATTATGATGTC-3′); LE-ACS2 mutant S(460, 462)G, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGATTTGAGATTGCA-3′), antisense (5′-CTTTTCCCAAAACCAAGTCTCAAATTATTC-3′), sense (5′-GAATAATTTGAGACTTGGTTTTGGGAAAAG-3′);LE-ACS2 mutant S460E, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGGATTTGAGATTGCA-3′), antisense (5′-CTTTTCGAAAACTCAAGTCTCAAATTATTC-3′), sense (5′-GAATAATTTGAGACTTGAGTTTTCGAAAAG-3′), antisense (5′-TTCCTCGAGGCTAAGACAAATTATGATGTC-3′); LE-ACS3wild-type, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGAAACTATTGTCAGAG-3′), antisense (5′-CGCGGATCCCTATCGTTCTCTTTGA-3′); LE-ACS4 wild-type, sense (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGATTTGGAGACGAGT-3′), antisense (5′-CGCGGATCCAGCTAATAACATTTT-3′). cDNA fragments of LE-ACS2, -3, and -4 containing the full coding region (21Tatsuki M. Mori H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction. cDNAs created by site-directed mutagenesis were constructed using a polymerase chain reaction-based method (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar). These DNA fragments were cloned into BSII TSK− (23Ichihara Y. Kurosawa Y. Gene. 1993; 130: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or pZErOTM-2.1 vectors (Invitrogen). Mutant cDNAs were sequenced in their entirety to verify that the desired codon changes were the only mutations in the cDNA. The final cDNAs were cloned into a pET 32a vector (Novagen). The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLys (Novagen). Induction was performed with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-galactoside. Thioredoxin and His-6 fusion proteins of LE-ACSs were affinity-purified with TALONTMmetal affinity resin (CLONTECH). For production of the anti-LE-ACS2 antibody, a rabbit was immunized with purified wild-type recombinant LE-ACS2 using multiple intradermal injection methods (24Vaitukaitis J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For affinity purification of the anti-LE-ACS2 antibody, wild-type recombinant LE-ACS2 was digested with enterokinase (Enterokinase MaxTM, Invitrogen) to remove the thioredoxin and His-6 tags. The LE-ACS2 protein was cross-linked to a HiTrap NHS-activated column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The anti-LE-ACS2 antibody was purified by affinity chromatography using the LE-ACS2 column. The bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 mglycine-HCl (pH 3.0) and immediately adjusted to pH 8.0. To remove antibodies against E. coli DnaK and GroEL proteins, which contaminated the anti-LE-ACS2 antibody, DnaK and GroEL proteins were expressed in E. coli, and the purified proteins were cross-linked to a HiTrap NHS-activated column as described above. The anti-LE-ACS2 antibody was applied to the DnaK and GroEL column, and the unbound fraction was collected as purified anti-LE-ACS2 antibody. Purified anti-LE-ACS2 antibody did not cross-react with Hsp70 and Hsp60 of plants (data not shown). ACS was extracted with Buffer A (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 µm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, proteinase inhibitors (CompleteTM, EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 15000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant proteins were precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (between 30 and 75% saturation), and the resulting pellets were dissolved in Buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl instead of 200 mm Tris-HCl in Buffer A) and then desalted with PD10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. Protein kinase was extracted from wounded tomato fruit with Buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, CompleteTM). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15000 × g for 10 min and fractionated with polyethylene glycol. Proteins precipitating between 5 and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol were collected by centrifugation at 15000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in Buffer D (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, CompleteTM) and were used as the crude protein kinase fraction. Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; 10% acrylamide gels) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (BA-S 85; Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). Purified anti-LE-ACS2 antibody was used at a concentration of 50 µg/ml. The membrane was washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and then reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) at a dilution of 1:20,000. Detection was achieved using Super Signal West FemtoTM (Pierce). ACS activity was assayed as described previously (25Yoshii H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 369-379Google Scholar), and ACC was determined using the method of Lizada and Yang (26Lizada M.C.C. Yang S.F. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). 1 unit of enzyme converts 1 nmol of AdoMet to ACC per hour at 30 °C. Sliced tomato fruit was incubated for 3 h as described above and then fed with 1 mCi of [32P]Pi (PBS13; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h. Radiolabeled proteins were extracted, and the 30 to 75% (NH4)2SO4 fraction of the extract was dissolved in Buffer B and desalted on a PD10 column that was pre-equilibrated with Buffer B as described above. Affinity-purified anti-LE-ACS2 antibodies (1.5 µg) were added to this sample, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the mixture was rotated for 30 min and then centrifuged. The resulting pellets were washed six times with Buffer E, which contained 0.5% Triton X-100 in Buffer B. The immune complexes were eluted from the washed pellets with SDS sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.3m β-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol) and separated using SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gels). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) solution (0.05% CBB, 50% MeOH, and 10% acetic acid) and destained with 50% MeOH and 10% acetic acid. The dried gel was placed on an imaging plate for 1 day, and the radiographic image was analyzed using a bioimaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photofilm Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). 32P-Labeled proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE as described above and then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphorylated protein band was excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and partially hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl for 1 h at 110 °C (27Kamps M.D. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The hydrolyzed amino acids were separated using two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension and at pH 3.5 in the second dimension (28King M.M. Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9925-9930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards were separated with the labeled samples. The dried thin-layer plates were sprayed with ninhydrin (Ninhydrin spray; Wako, Tokyo, Japan) to locate the phosphoamino acid standards and then placed on an imaging plate for 1 week to detect the radiographic image as described above. Incorporation of [32P]Pi into the thioredoxin LE-ACS fusion protein was performed in a kinase reaction mixture (40 µl) that consisted of 70 pmol of purified recombinant LE-ACS2s as substrate proteins, 1 µg of the kinase fraction, and 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.22 nCi/pmol) in Buffer D with 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 0.5 mm EGTA. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C and stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The polypeptides were separated using SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity incorporated in the LE-ACS isozymes was detected as described above. [32P]Pi was incorporated into the synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal region of LE-ACS2 in a kinase reaction mixture (40 µl), which consisted of 10 nmol of synthetic peptide (P1, NH2-HHHHHHMYDESVLSPLSSPIPPSPLVR; P2, NH2-HHHHHHNLRLSFSKRMYDESVLSPLSS; P3, NH2-HHHHHHMEKKQQWKKNNLRLSFSKR; P4, NH2-HHHHHHFVGVEKSGDKSSSMEKKQQ; P5, NH2-HHHHHHFANMDDGTVDIALARIRRFV), 0.8 µg of the kinase fraction, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP in Buffer D with 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 0.5 mm EGTA. Following a 10-min incubation, a 20-µl aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman). The papers were washed three times in excess 75 mmH3PO4 (10 min per wash). 32P incorporation into the peptide was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. The 30 to 75% (NH4)2SO4 fractions of the wounded fruit extracts were dissolved in Buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 µm PLP, CompleteTM) and desalted on PD 10 columns that were pre-equilibrated with Buffer F. This sample was incubated in PP2A reaction mixture (2 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01 mm MnCl2, 1% glycerol, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 µm PLP, CompleteTM, 0.04 units of purified PP2A from human red blood cells (Upstate Biotechnology)) or in λ-PPase reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 2 mmMnCl2, 10 µm PLP, CompleteTM, 80 units of recombinant λ-PPase (New England BioLabs)) for 10 min at 30 °C. The protein samples (100 µl) were added to 500 µl of ACS assay buffer (25Yoshii H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 369-379Google Scholar), and the activity was measured. We prepared an anti-LE-ACS2 antibody using recombinant LE-ACS2 expressed in E. coli as the antigen. To confirm that the purified antibody recognized LE-ACS2, Western blot analysis was performed with wounded fruit extract. Wounded pink tissues were homogenized with proteinase inhibitors to prevent proteolysis. The anti-LE-ACS2 antibody specifically recognized a 55-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1A, left). Next, the ACS activity was assayed in wounded fruit extracts before and after immunoprecipitation. The anti-LE-ACS2 antibody completely precipitated the wound-induced enzymatic activity, whereas the preimmune IgG did not (data not shown). This result indicated that the anti-LE-ACS2 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the native form of LE-ACS2 in the fruit extracts. Previous reports suggested that proteolytic processing of ACS occursin vivo and in vitro (3Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Our finding that LE-ACS2 was a 55-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1A, left), the molecular mass that corresponds to the one calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence, suggested that proteolytic processing did not occur in vivo. To clarify how the apparent proteolytic processing occurred, we prepared wounded fruit extracts without proteinase inhibitors and analyzed them using Western blot analyses. In this sample, 49- and 47-kDa polypeptides were detected (Fig.1 A, right). ACS activity was detected in both extracts, which were prepared with or without proteinase inhibitors; the activity (± standard deviation; units/mg total protein) of the extracts prepared with proteinase inhibitors was 7.59 ± 0.31 and that without was 10.6 ± 0.37. These results suggest that the truncated form, the 49- or 47-kDa polypeptide, remained enzymatically active. To further clarify whether the 49- or 47-kDa polypeptides were derived from the 55-kDa polypeptide, a crude extract was prepared with proteinase inhibitors, and the inhibitors were then removed from the extract by gel filtration. When this sample was incubated at 25 °C, the amount of the 55-kDa polypeptide decreased with time, and that of the 49- and 47-kDa polypeptides simultaneously increased (Fig.1 B). Thus, the in vivo molecular mass of LE-ACS2 is 55 kDa, and it is converted to the 49- and 47-kDa polypeptides during extraction by proteinases in the absence of proteinase inhibitors. In addition, after the proteinase inhibitors were removed from the extract, LE-ACS2 was readily digested by the trace amounts of proteinases that remained active in the extract, suggesting that LE-ACS2 was easily attacked by proteinases. To determine whether ACS is phosphorylated in vivo, pericarp tissues of pink fruit were sliced, fed with [32P]Pi, and homogenized with proteinase inhibitors. A 55-kDa 32P-labeled phosphoprotein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-LE-ACS2 antibody (Fig.2A, lane 3) but not with preimmune IgG (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The size of the 32P-labeled phosphoprotein was consistent with the 55-kDa polypeptide that was detected in the total extract using Western blot analysis with the anti-LE-ACS2 antibody (Fig. 2 B). Non-radiolabeled recombinant LE-ACS2 expressed in E. colicompeted with the 32P-labeled protein in immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). These results confirm that the 32P-labeled 55-kDa protein is LE-ACS2. When the extraction was performed without proteinase inhibitors, radiolabeled polypeptides were not immunoprecipitated with the anti-LE-ACS2 (data not shown), although the 49- and 47-kDa polypeptides were detectable by the anti-LE-ACS2 antibody in the total extract with Western blot analysis (data not shown). This finding suggests that the smaller proteolytic polypeptides derived from LE-ACS2 were not phosphorylated. To determine which amino acid residue(s) were phosphorylated,32P-labeled LE-ACS2 was acid-hydrolyzed, and the resulting amino acids were separated using two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis. A radioactive spot was located at the phosphoserine site (Fig. 3), indicating that LE-ACS2 was phosphorylated on serine residue(s). To establish an in vitro ACS phosphorylation system, purified recombinant LE-ACS2 was used as a protein kinase substrate that was extracted from wounded tomato fruit. The 5 to 20% polyethylene glycol fractions were used as the crude protein kinase fraction, because its specific activity of 335 (nmol of phosphate/min/mg of substrate/mg of protein) was higher than that of the 30 to 60% (NH4)2SO4 fractions of 15 (nmol of phosphate/min/mg of substrate/mg of protein). The molecular mass of recombinant LE-ACS2 is 72 kDa, because tag proteins are also included. Fig. 4shows the results of in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant LE-ACS2. Incubation of the substrates with ATP and a fraction of the protein kinase resulted in the incorporation of 32P from γ-labeled ATP into the 72-kDa polypeptides in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A andB). 25% of the total recombinant LE-ACS2 was phosphorylated in the in vitro ACS phosphorylation system after a 10-min incubation, assuming that the LE-ACS2 possessed only one phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation did not occur in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that phosphorylation of recombinant LE-ACS2 is Ca2+-dependent. The in vitrophosphorylation system was used to determine the phosphorylation site of LE-ACS2 using various mutant LE-ACS2s and synthetic polypeptides as substrates. The C-terminal-deleted LE-ACS2, which was digested by the proteinase during extraction, was not phosphorylated (data not shown), and the deletion mutant LE-ACS2, which lacked 46 amino acids from the C-terminal, was not phosphorylated (Fig.5B, lane 2), suggesting that the C-terminal region includes the phosphorylation site. To determine which serine residue(s) were phosphorylated, we used various synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal region of ACS as substrates (Fig. 6A). Fig.6 B shows that peptides 2 and 3 were highly phosphorylated. These findings suggest that Ser-460 and/or Ser-462 are phosphorylated. Thus, we constructed site-directed mutagenized recombinant LE-ACS2s, S460G (which converted Ser-460 into Gly), S462G, S(460, 462)G (which converted Ser-460 and Ser-462 into Gly), and S460E. All mutant LE-ACS2s that converted Ser-460 into another residue were not phosphorylated (Fig. 7B), indicating that Ser-460 is the LE-ACS2 phosphorylation site.Figure 5In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant LE-ACS2 mutants. Wild-type recombinant LE-ACS2 (lane 1) and C-terminal deletion mutant LE-ACS2 (lane 2) were incubated for 10 min with a protein kinase fraction in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP.

To determine whether other isozymes that have a phosphorylation site similar to that of LE-ACS2 are phosphorylated, in vitro phosphorylation was performed using other tomato isozymes, LE-ACS3 and LE-ACS4. LE-ACS3 has the same sequence as LE-ACS2, and LE-ACS4 does not. Although recombinant LE-ACS3 was phosphorylated similarly to LE-ACS2, LE-ACS4 was not (Fig.9). These results suggest that LE-ACS3 is also phosphorylated in vivo and that isozymes that possess the amino acid sequence surrounding the LE-ACS2 phosphorylation site of the C-terminal region can be phosphorylated.Figure 9In vitro phosphorylation of ACS isozymes. Purified recombinant LE-ACS2 (lane 1), LE-ACS3 (lane 2), and LE-ACS4 (lane 3), which were expressed in E. coli, were incubated with a protein kinase fraction as described in the legend for Fig. 4. A, CBB staining; B, radiographic image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the effect of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on enzymatic activity, the activity of wound-inducible ACSs, which include mainly phosphorylated LE-ACS2, was assayed after dephosphorylation by PP2A and λ-PPase. The activity (± standard deviation; units/mg of total protein) of the ACS that was treated with PP2A was 4.99 ± 0.42, and that of native ACS was 5.16 ± 0.13. The activity of the ACS that was treated with λ-PPase was 4.01 ± 0.18, and that of native ACS was 4.32 ± 0.12. There was no significant difference between native and dephosphorylated ACS activity. Furthermore, the specific activity of in vitrophosphorylated recombinant LE-ACS2 was the same as that of the non-phosphorylated recombinant LE-ACS2; the activities (± standard deviation) of phosphorylated recombinant LE-ACS2 and non-phosphorylated LE-ACS2 were 153109 ± 2001 and 156566 ± 6313 units/mg of total protein, respectively. Recombinant LE-ACS2, which was site-directed mutagenized (Ser-460 to Glu) to introduce a negative charge despite phosphorylation, also did not change the specific activity (151328 ± 2087 units/mg of total protein). These results indicate that phosphorylation of LE-ACS2 did not affect enzymatic activity. The findings of the present study indicate that LE-ACS2 is phosphorylated on Ser-460 at the C-terminal region. Previous studies using protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors indicated that protein phosphorylation was involved in the regulation of ACS (19Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Tuomainen J. Betz C. Kangasjarvi J. Ernst D. Yin Z.-H. Langebartels C. Sandermann Jr., H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1151-1162Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). There was no direct evidence of this, however, at the molecular level. Our results clearly show that protein phosphorylation of ACS occursin vivo. ACSs are thought to cleave at the C-terminal region, and cleavage of this region increases enzymatic activity (12Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results indicate that the molecular mass of LE-ACS2 is 55 kDa, however, which is consistent with that calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 1), indicating that cleavage does not occur in vivo. The 55-kDa polypeptide was easily cleaved during extraction with a proteinase, resulting in the 47-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1). Because both the 47-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1) and the recombinant ACSs that were truncated at the C-terminal region (12Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had enzymatic activity, the 47-kDa polypeptide is probably truncated at the C terminus and not at the N terminus. This is supported by the finding that crystallized apple ACS lacks a segment of ∼5-kDa at the C terminus (29Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although proteolytic processing of the C-terminal region does not occurin vivo, ACS is phosphorylated at the C-terminal region, which was thought to be cleaved from ACS. Our results led us to speculate that the failure of Spanu et al. (19Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to detect phosphorylated ACS was because of the deletion of the phosphorylation site from the C terminus during extraction in the absence of suitable or effective proteinase inhibitors. The deduced amino acid sequences of various ACS isozymes reported so far reveal that the C-terminal regions of ACSs are not conserved despite a high degree of similarity in the rest of the protein (3Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Some ACSs possess the (F/L)RLS(F/L) sequence at the C-terminal region (Fig. 8). Recombinant LE-ACS3, which has this sequence as a substrate, was phosphorylated in vitro, whereas LE-ACS4, which does not have this phosphorylation site, was not phosphorylated. These results suggest that the (F/L)RLS(F/F) sequence is also phosphorylated in other ACSs. Although various protein kinase substrate recognition motifs have been reported in plants (30Hardie D.G. Shewry P.R. Halford N.G. Hooley R. Protein Phosphorylation in Plants. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 3-15Google Scholar), this is the first report of the LE-ACS phosphorylation site. Characterization of the specific protein kinases involved and the determination of substrate specificity are necessary to further understand the phosphorylation of ACSs. Spanu et al. (19Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that although treatment with protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors affected ACS activity, the ACS activity in the extracts from elicitor-treated cells was not affected by protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A from rabbit muscle or alkaline phosphatase (19Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, treatment of extracts from wounded tomato fruit with PP2A and λ-PPase did not affect ACS activity. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of recombinant LE-ACS2 did not change after in vitro phosphorylation. Thus, we suggest that phosphorylation of ACS does not change enzymatic activity. The possibility that phosphorylation of ACS regulates ethylene production is supported by the finding that alteration of the C-terminal region of Arabidopsis ACS5 induces theeto2–1 mutant to overproduce ethylene (10Vogel J.P. Woeste K.E. Theologis A. Kieber J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Vogel et al. (10Vogel J.P. Woeste K.E. Theologis A. Kieber J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) reported that eto2–1 has a single base pair insertion 35 base pairs upstream from the stop codon and that this frameshift mutation was predicted to change the 12 terminal amino acids of ACS5 from RVSYTDRVPDER to PGFMDRSCT (Fig. 8). Comparing the deduced amino acid sequence among the various ACS isozymes, ACS5 could be phosphorylated at RVS, that is, Ser-400, in vivo. If this is the case, the eto2–1 version ofACS5 lost the deduced phosphorylation site. Because alteration of this region resulted in a 20-fold increase in ethylene production in eto2–1 relative to the wild-type, Vogelet al. (10Vogel J.P. Woeste K.E. Theologis A. Kieber J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) suggested that this domain acts as a negative regulator of ACS5 function. Although mutation of the C-terminal region of ACS5 leads to increased ethylene production, the eto2–1version of ACS5 had a specific activity comparable with that of the wild-type expressed in E. coli. It seems that the role of ACS phosphorylation is not to regulate specific activity. Spanuet al. (19Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that a protein kinase inhibitor blocked elicitor-induced ACS activity, and a protein phosphatase inhibitor increased ACS activity. Furthermore, Ecker's group recently identified the ETO1 gene (31Cosgrove D.J. Gilroy S. Kao T.-H. Ma H. Schultz J.C. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They reported that the ETO1 protein bound to the C-terminal region of ACS5 and inhibited its activity. These reports and our results suggest that the C-terminal domain has a pivotal role in the regulation of ACS turnover. One possible mechanism of regulation by phosphorylation is that the non-phosphorylated C-terminal region of ACS might be the target of some proteins (e.g. ETO1) involved in a degradation system, such as the ubiquitin system. The loss of the deduced phosphorylation site, such as the eto2–1 version of ACS5, might prevent the binding of some proteins, whereas phosphorylation might impede the binding of some proteins to the C-terminal domain. Consequently, phosphorylated ACS would be protected from the degradation system, the turnover of phosphorylated ACS would be prolonged, ACS would accumulate, and ACS activity would increase, especially in the case of the explosive increase of ACS activity following stimulation. The change of the C-terminal sequence (e.g. eto2–1) might mimic this phenomenon. Further study of the difference in turnover on non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated ACS and the identification of protein kinase(s), protein phosphatase(s) involved in ACSs phosphorylation states, and hypothetical binding proteins are needed. Because the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site is conserved in various ACSs, phosphorylation might be a general feature of the ACSs in other species besides tomato. Although we could not determine the physiologic role of LE-ACS2 phosphorylation, the present results suggest that different isozymes are regulated by different phosphorylation states. Of particular interest is that LE-ACS4 does not have the deduced phosphorylation site (Fig. 8) and is not phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 9). During tomato-ripening stages, expression of both LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4mRNAs increase. Although the contribution of LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 enzyme activities to the production of ethylene during ripening stages has not been demonstrated, these isozymes might have different post-translational regulatory mechanisms, such as phosphorylation. To clarify how ACS is regulated by its phosphorylation state, further studies are needed to determine whether the phosphorylation of ACS is reversible and whether other ACS isozymes are phosphorylated. In conclusion, the tomato wound-inducible ACS isozyme, LE-ACS2, is phosphorylated at the C-terminal region, which was previously thought to be truncated. The present study will help to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of ethylene biosynthesis by post-translational regulation of ACS. We thank Dr. S. Huber and Dr. K. Izui for valuable discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2010084732,"We have demonstrated previously that the Slit proteins, which are involved in axonal guidance and related developmental processes in nervous tissue, are ligands of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 in brain (Liang, Y., Annan, R. S., Carr, S. A., Popp, S., Mevissen, M., Margolis, R. K., and Margolis, R. U. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17885--17892). To characterize these interactions in more detail, recombinant human Slit-2 protein and the N- and C-terminal portions generated by in vivo proteolytic processing were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the binding of a glypican-Fc fusion protein. Saturable and reversible high affinity binding to the full-length protein and to the C-terminal portion that is released from the cell membrane was seen, with dissociation constants in the 80-110 nm range, whereas only a relatively low level of binding to the larger N-terminal segment was detected. Co-transfection of 293 cells with Slit and glypican-1 cDNAs followed by immunoprecipitation demonstrated that these interactions also occur in vivo, and immunocytochemical studies showed colocalization in the embryonic and adult central nervous system. The binding affinity of the glypican core protein to Slit is an order of magnitude lower than that of the glycanated proteoglycan. Glypican binding to Slit was also decreased 80--90% by heparin (2 microg/ml), enzymatic removal of the heparan sulfate chains, and by chlorate inhibition of glypican sulfation. The differential effects of N- or O-desulfated heparin on glypican binding also indicate that O-sulfate groups on the heparan sulfate chains play a critical role in heparin interactions with Slit. Our data suggest that glypican binding to the releasable C-terminal portion of Slit may serve as a mechanism for regulating the biological activity of Slit and/or the proteoglycan."

In the present report, a polyclonal antibody directed against rat calpain 10 was developed. This antibody was used to monitor the expression of calpain 10 protein in tissues from rats, mice, and humans. Calpain 10 protein was found to be present in all tissues examined by Western blotting including the lens, retina, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Although some calpain 10 was detectable in the water-soluble protein fraction of these tissues, it was preferentially found in the water-insoluble fraction. In the lens, immunohistochemistry revealed that calpain 10 was predominately located in the cytoplasm of epithelial and newly differentiating lens fibers at the transition zone. However, calpain 10 was found to be associated with the plasma membrane of differentiated lens fiber cells and the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle. In the lens epithelium-derived cell line, αTN4–1, the calpain 10 protein was found in a punctate distribution in the cell nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. After the elevation of intracellular calcium levels with ionomycin, calpain 10 protein levels in the nucleus of αTN4–1 cells increased markedly, whereas those in the cytoplasm decreased. In the lens, the elevation of intracellular calcium levels after selenite administration resulted in increased levels of calpain 10 RNA within 1 day and a loss of calpain 10 protein from the lens nucleus coincident with the onset of selenite cataract.

The typical four-domain structure of the catalytic subunit is comprised of domain I (autolytic activation), domain II (cysteine catalytic site), domain III (“electrostatic switch”), and domain IV (calmodulin-like calcium binding sites) (3Hosfield C.M.

Recently, atypical calpains including calpains 5, 6, and 10 have been described, where certain domains have been replaced or deleted (11Barnes T.M. Hodgkin J.

Calpain 10 is especially interesting, because the calmodulin domain was replaced with a divergent T domain containing no calcium-binding EF-hand structures. TRA-3, an atypical calpain fromCaenorhabditis elegans likewise has the T domain replacement, yet TRA-3 exhibited Ca2+-dependent protease activity (15Sokol S.B. Kuwabara P.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 901-906PubMed Google Scholar). Transcripts for calpain 10 were ubiquitously found in many human (16Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y.

This raised the real possibility that most tissues contain a calpain that either does not need calcium for activity or uses an activation mechanism different from the traditional calpains. Furthermore, Horikawa et al. (16Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E.H. Bosque-Plata L.D. Horikawa Y. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I.

Alternative splicing may generate at least eight forms of calpain 10, some of which would also lack the protease domain. Altered expression of calpain 10 enzyme in pancreatic, muscle, and fat cells was postulated to lead to abnormal glucose homeostasis because of modification in an unknown calpain 10-dependent pathway. To our knowledge, nothing is known about the protein expression or cellular localization of calpain 10 or whether calpain 10 is altered under conditions of elevated cellular calcium. Such data would be important for understanding the mechanism of action of calpain 10 in both normal and disease conditions. Thus, in the experiments reported below we developed and used an antibody to measure calpain 10 protein expression in normal human, rat, and mouse tissues as well as in cultured lens epithelial cells and experimental cataract, in which cellular calcium was elevated. Experimental cataract was used because it is a well documented example of excessive calpain activity leading to a pathologic condition (18Shearer T.R. Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Mol. Vis. 1997; 3 (abstr.): 8PubMed Google Scholar) All animals were handled in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines (28National Institutes of Health (1985) Guiding Principles in Care and Use of Animals, DHEW Publication no. 86-23.Google Scholar). To produce nuclear cataract in rats, a single subcutaneous injection of sodium selenite at 30 µmol/kg of body weight was administered to 12-day-old Harlan Sprague–Dawley rats (B & K International, Fremont, CA) as described previously (18Shearer T.R. Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Mol. Vis. 1997; 3 (abstr.): 8PubMed Google Scholar). Lenses were subsequently removed by a posterior approach, and lens capsule/epithelium dissections were performed under a dissecting microscope (×16) by removing the capsule with adhering epithelium. Ten preparations were pooled to obtain sufficient material. The interface between the cortex and nucleus of the remaining lens mass was determined by the appearance of cold cataract, and cortical and nuclear regions were dissected at ∼50% of the lens radius. All lens and soft tissues were chilled throughout the dissection to prevent breakdown of RNA. After homogenization in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 ml/100 mg of tissue, RNA was extracted according to manufacturer instructions. Total RNA was then treated with DNase to remove genomic DNA, and quantitation was performed spectrophotometrically. PCR1 cloning was performed on rat lens total RNA. On the basis of the cDNA sequence for mouse calpain-like protease formerly named calpain 8 (17Braum C. Engel M. Theisinger B. Welter C. Seifert M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the PCR primers used to amplify the partial rat calpain 10 cDNA were: upstream, 5′-GAA GGG GAG CCC AGG GCG CCG AAG ATG-3′, and downstream, 5′-GCA GTG TTG CTG TAG GGT GAT ACG GAT G-3′. Five µg of lens RNA were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed for 40 min at 42 °C in a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc.). The mixture was then heated to 70 °C for 5 min. A 1-µl RT reaction mixture was subsequently transferred to a PCR tube containing one Ready-To-Go PCR bead (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.2 µm each upstream and downstream primers. Water was then added up to a final volume of 25 µl. For PCR, 35 cycles were executed as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products (15 µl) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining (10 mg/ml) and subcloned by a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The resulting 1700-nucleotide PCR product was gel-purified and subcloned using the TA cloning kit. The inserts from three independent clones were sequenced and found to consist of a portion of the 5′-untranslanted region 1677 bases of the coding sequence from calpain 10. For cloning the 3′ end of rat calpain 10 cDNA, 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR was performed with the 3′ system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends according to manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). First-strand cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 50 min with 5 µg of rat lens total RNA using an Adapter primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The next PCR amplification using this cDNA as a template and Ready-To-Go PCR bead was performed as follows: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 5 min with 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends universal amplification primer and the target-specific primer based on the sequences of rat calpain 10. The resultant PCR products were subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector and sequenced according to manufacturer protocols (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR analysis, 2.5 µg of RNA from various rat tissues were used for the first-strand RT reaction using the oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. One-tenth of the resulting cDNA was subjected to 35 PCR cycles using the same downstream primer listed above and the upstream primer 5′-AAC CCA GCG AGG TGT GTG TGG CTG TT-3′. Ten µl of the amplified DNA samples were resolved in a 1.5% agarose gel. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) and scanned by Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad). To allow direct comparison between multiple samples, QuantumRNA 18S internal standard was used as the internal control (Ambion). The PCR conditions of this relative RT-PCR for calpain 10 were 94 °C for 2 min followed by 33 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 63 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products for both calpain 10 and 18S internal standard were evaluated during the exponential phase of the amplification process. Ten µl of amplified DNA samples were size-separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) and scanned by Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad). NIH Image 1.57 software was used to invert the image and measure the uncalibrated optical density of the bands corresponding to PCR products. To compare multiple samples, the ratio of densities for target/18S rRNA was calculated for each reaction. cDNA for the entire calpain 10 coding region from mouse was subcloned into the pFastBacHTb vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing N-terminal His tags and rTEV protease cleavage sites betweenSalI and XbaI. The calpain 10 plasmid was transformed into DH10 Bac-competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). High molecular weight DNA was prepared from selected Escherichia coli clones containing the calpain 10 bacmid; then this DNA was transfected to insect Sf9 cells. The cells were maintained in Sf-900 II SFM medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin and were collected 5 days after transfection. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and homogenized on ice in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithioerythritol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The antibody for calpain 10 for potential use with rat, mouse, and human samples was generated by first chemically synthesizing the peptide WSLKDIRKASGQQDRPSGGE, which corresponds to a 20-amino acid sequence in domain II of rat calpain 10 (Fig. 2A). The similarity of the rat immunogenic peptide to the sequence in mouse and human calpain 10 was 90 and 50%, respectively, with 100% similarity among all three species for a shorter amino acid sequence predicted to be surface epitopes (underlined in the peptide sequence above). The peptide was high pressure liquid chromatography-purified and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide conjugation (TriplePoint Biologics, Portland, OR). The first immunization was with Freund's complete adjuvant, and subsequent immunizations were at 4-week intervals with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were anesthetized and exsanguinated, and the antibody was purified from serum using the peptide bound to Aminolink resin (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The antibody gave positive staining after immunoblotting and/or immunohistochemistry against rat, mouse, and human tissues, an αTN4–1 mouse cell line, and recombinant mouse calpain 10 overexpressed in insect cells (discussed below). The antibody did not cross-react with rat Lp82 calpain or m-calpain on immunoblots (data not shown), suggesting that the antibody possessed significant specificity for calpain 10. Lenses and other soft tissues from 12-day-old and mother rats were homogenized in buffer A containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Human lenses from organ donors (Lions Eye Bank of Oregon) were homogenized in the same buffer A. Soluble proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed in buffer A again. The remaining pellets were resuspended in the same buffer for analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye-binding reagent with BSA as standard. Proteins were separated on pre-cast 1.0-mm thick 8 × 8-cm 8% polyacrylamide mini-gels (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting was performed by electrotransferring the proteins from the mini-polyacrylamide gels to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 30 volts (constant) for 90 min at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h. The affinity-purified polyclonal antibody made against rat calpain 10 was used at 1:200 dilution, and immunoreactivity was visualized with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and BCIP/NBT (Bio-Rad). Images of gels and immunoblots were digitized on a flat-bed scanner, and image analysis was performed by NIH Image 1.57 software. For immunohistochemistry, unfixed lenses were embedded in tissue-freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical, Durham, NC), and 15-µm frozen sections were prepared as described previously (19Reed N.A. Dong-Jin O. Czymmek K.J. Duncan M.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 253: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Calpain proteins were detected with the antibodies described below. The primary antibody for calpain 10 was diluted 1:200 in PBS with 1% BSA. The bound nonfluoresceinated antibodies were visualized after incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated, 1:50 dilution in PBS with 1% BSA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the cell nuclei were detected by counterstaining with SYTO-13 (1:1000 dilution in PBS; Molecular Probes). The slides were coverslipped, and 50 µl of mounting medium (9.25 mm p-phenylenediamine in 90% glycerol with PBS) were added to each slide. The slides were stored at −20 °C until confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope configured with an Argon/Krypton laser (488- and 568-nm excitation lines). For immunofluorescence with cell lines, maintenance and preparation of the αTN4–1 cells were followed as described previously (20Ma H. Shih M. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Duncan M. Reed N. Richard I. Beckmann J.S. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4232-4239PubMed Google Scholar). αΤN4–1 cells (1.0–1.2 × 105) were inoculated on a chambered 1.5-mm cover-glassed tissue culture dish (Lab Tech II) for 20 h. The cells were treated with various concentrations of ionomycin for 30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The chambers were rinsed three times with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 75 min. The primary antibody was incubated at a 1:200 dilution in each chamber with 3% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C with shaking. The chambers were rinsed three times with 3% BSA in PBS for 10 min. The following steps were performed in a dimly lit work area. The secondary antibody was added at a 1:200 dilution in PBS with 3% BSA (Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated, Molecular Probes), and the cell nuclei were detected by counterstaining with SYTO-13 at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS (Molecular Probes) for 60 min. The chambers were rinsed three times with 3% BSA in PBS and rinsed once with 1× PBS. The PBS was removed, and two drops of SlowFade Component B (S-2828, Molecular Probes) was added just before scanning on a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope configured with an argon/krypton laser (488 and 568 nm excitation lines). The cDNA for calpain 10 from young rat lens total RNA was cloned and sequenced to provide the complete coding region along with portions of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (GenBank accession no. AF227909). The nucleotide sequence was 70 and 91% identical with human and mouse calpain 10, respectively (16Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E.H. Bosque-Plata L.D. Horikawa Y. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I. Colilla S. Polonsky K.S. Wei S. Concannon P. Iwasaki N. Schulze J. Baier L.J. Bogardus C. Groop L. Boerwinkle E. Hanis C.L. Bell G.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The single long open reading frame in the cDNA for calpain 10 coded for 666 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 74,527 Da. The protein for rat calpain 10 could be divided into the canonical four-domain structure typical of calpains (Fig. 2 A). Domain II contained the Cys, His, and Asn residues found in the active site of other calpain catalytic subunits (1Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Sugihara H. Imajoh S. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9465-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The divergent C-terminal domain T showed no significant similarity to the calmodulin-like Ca-binding domain IV of the traditional calpains. The overall similarity of rat calpain 10 with the catalytic subunit of ubiquitous m-calpain was only 15%, and the similarity with lens-specific calpain Lp82 was 18%. RT-PCR revealed that calpain 10 transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in all rat tissues examined (Fig. 1A). The highest level of expression in young rat was in brain, and the lowest was in spleen, whereas in the adult human, heart showed the highest level of expression (16Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E.H. Bosque-Plata L.D. Horikawa Y. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I. Colilla S. Polonsky K.S. Wei S. Concannon P. Iwasaki N. Schulze J. Baier L.J. Bogardus C. Groop L. Boerwinkle E. Hanis C.L. Bell G.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Lens was studied in detail in the present experiments as an example of a terminally differentiated tissue with very little protein turnover in the center (nucleus) during the lifetime of the host (21Harding J. Cataract: Biochemistry, Epidemiology, and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, London1991: 21Google Scholar). mRNA for calpain 10 was detected in all lens regions with the most abundant in the outer region of lens epithelium (Fig.1 B). The oldest portion of the lens, the inner nucleus region, showed the lowest level of mRNA for calpain 10. The cDNA sequence was shown to be a translatable message, because insect cells infected with the mouse cDNA overexpressed recombinant calpain 10 in the soluble and insoluble fractions at the expected 78.8 kDa position (extra 36 amino acids on the N terminus of the recombinant protein) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 5, solid arrow). The lower immunoreactive band was presumed to be endogenous calpain 10, because it migrated at the expected size of 74.5 kDa for native calpain 10, and it was ubiquitously expressed in infected as well as noninfected cells (lanes 2 and 3). Immunoblotting also confirmed that calpain 10 transcripts were ubiquitously translated in tissues from young rats and that the protein was stable (Fig.3, lanes 1–10). Two protein bands were present in most tissues near the expected size of 74.5 kDa (arrows). In these tissues, a large fraction of the calpain 10 protein was not readily soluble in aqueous buffers (data not shown). The full-length cDNA of mouse calpain 10 was also subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector for transient expression in COS-7 cells. Preliminary results showed two similar immunoreactive bands (data not shown).Figure 3Expression of calpain 10 protein in rat tissues. An immunoblot for calpain 10 in the soluble proteins from various tissues from 12-day-old rats. The arrows indicate two major bands for calpain 10. The higher molecular mass bands in heart and muscle are unidentified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoblotting also identified calpain 10 orthologues in human lenses (Fig. 4). Young human lens showed immunopositive proteins near 74.5 kDa in both the soluble and insoluble lens proteins. Appreciable levels of immunostaining were found only in young lenses up to 3 years of age. Calpain 10 proteins were not detectable in aged human lenses (69–85 year old). These results suggested that calpain 10 protein expression was associated with developing lens and then lost with aging. Immunohistochemistry with the calpain 10 antibody revealed that calpain 10 was located mainly in the cytoplasm of the epithelium and transition zone of the newborn mouse lens (Fig. 5, A andB), whereas the primary and secondary fibers in the cortex and nucleus showed much lower levels. Calpain 10 in human lens was also concentrated in the lens epithelium (Fig. 5, C andD). However, in the outer fiber cells of human lens, calpain 10 was concentrated at the plasma membranes (Fig. 5 C,arrow head). Similarly, calpain 10 immunoreactivity was predominantly found at the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle fibers from young mice (Fig. 5 E, arrow head). Note that because not all of the immunopositive bands on immunoblots with calpain have been positively identified, we cannot exclude the possibility that the antibody may be labeling other proteins in addition to calpain 10. Calpain 10 in cultured αTN4–1 mouse lens epithelial cells was not only present in the cytosol but also in the nucleus in a punctate arrangement (Fig. 6B). Double staining of this region for both calpain 10 and DNA showed that calpain 10 was not associated with DNA in the nucleus (Fig. 6 C). The nuclear localization of calpain 10 was confirmed further by a Z-series analysis with the confocal microscope that showed that calpain 10 was partially localized in the nucleus in micro compartments (data not shown). These observations agree with the computer-aided PSORT analysis for nuclear localization signals. The predicted calpain 10gene product showed a characteristic nuclear localization signal of +0.46 located in domain III. This was in contrast to the nuclear localization signal score of −0.10 for m-calpain, which accumulated only in the cytoplasm of αTN4–1 mouse cells (20Ma H. Shih M. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Duncan M. Reed N. Richard I. Beckmann J.S. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4232-4239PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, some of the immunostaining may be caused by non-calpain proteins, but the observations suggested that the calpain 10 may function by association with nuclear proteins. Interestingly, the elevation of intracellular calcium with 10 µm ionomycin caused decreased staining in the cytoplasm and increased staining in the nucleus (Fig. 6, E and F). A selenite nuclear cataract model was used to further investigate the influence of massive increases in cellular calcium on calpain 10. The concentration of calcium in the nuclear region of lenses with selenite cataract is known to reach over 100 µm free calcium compared with 0.2 µm for the normal nucleus (18Shearer T.R. Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Mol. Vis. 1997; 3 (abstr.): 8PubMed Google Scholar). mRNA levels for calpain 10 increased in the outer regions (epithelium and cortex) of lens during selenite cataract formation (Fig. 7A). Calpain 10 protein levels in rat lens in the epithelium (Fig.7 B) of selenite cataract decreased after day 3, whereas in nucleus (Fig. 7 C) calpain 10 was already lost by day 3 when the cataract appeared. Thus, calpain 10 transcripts were rapidly up-regulated in the outer regions of the lens during nuclear cataract formation, but calpain 10 protein was degraded when cataract was present. The data presented above provide the first evidence for the expression of the protein for calpain 10 in mouse, rat, and human tissues. This was important, because previous publications demonstrated transcription of thecalpain 10 gene (14Permutt M.A. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Inoue H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 819-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E.H. Bosque-Plata L.D. Horikawa Y. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I. Colilla S. Polonsky K.S. Wei S. Concannon P. Iwasaki N. Schulze J. Baier L.J. Bogardus C. Groop L. Boerwinkle E. Hanis C.L. Bell G.I. Nat.

Bogardus C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R69-R73Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), but no data have been provided until now that calpain 10 was actually translated in tissues. Our immunoblotting data demonstrated that calpain 10 protein was indeed ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined. Calpain 10 is thus the third ubiquitous calpain in tissues along with m- and µ-calpains. Most rat tissues showed at least two major protein bands near the expected 74.5-kDa predicted by the cDNA calpain 10. The highest concentration of calpain 10 was in the water-insoluble fraction of tissues, suggesting that a significant portion of cellular calpain 10 may be insoluble in the cytosol or associated with membranes or cytoskeletal elements. Calpain 10 protein expression varied with the particular tissue. Young lens was dominated by two proteins, whereas retina showed at least four protein bands. This variability was interesting, because Horikawa et al. (16Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E.H. Bosque-Plata L.D. Horikawa Y. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I. Colilla S. Polonsky K.S. Wei S. Concannon P. Iwasaki N. Schulze J. Baier L.J. Bogardus C. Groop L. Boerwinkle E. Hanis C.L. Bell G.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) hypothesized that polymorphism in thecalpain 10 gene contributed to the genetic susceptibility to diabetes type 2 in certain human population groups. In our studies, at least four factors may be responsible for variable calpain 10 expression patterns. 1) Protein degradation and autolysis: the traditional calpains are well known to undergo autolysis and degradation after calcium activation or aging (1Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Sugihara H. Imajoh S. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9465-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Recent studies also show that calpains are even substrates for each other after activation by calcium. 2H. Ma, C. Fukiage, Y. H. Kim, M. K. Duncan, N. A. Reed, M. Shih, M. Azuma, and T. R. Shearer, unpublished obersvations. 2) Aging: advancing age was associated with major losses in calpain 10 protein levels. Very little calpain 10 was present in the lenses of mature human and rat lenses, and the oldest region of the rat lens, the nucleus, also contained the lowest concentration of calpain 10 protein. In contrast, the high level of calpain 10 observed in the outer regions of lens may be needed for proteolysis occurring in this region during cell remodeling for terminal differentiation of lens fiber cells. This extensive remodeling is characterized by conversion of the outer cuboidal epithelial cells to long fibers with concomitant loss of all organelles as the fibers are pushed into the interior of the lens. Our results suggested that calpain 10 protein expression was associated with developing lens cells and then lost with aging. 3) mRNA processing: eight splice variants of the calpain 10 gene were identified in man (16Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E.H. Bosque-Plata L.D. Horikawa Y. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I. Colilla S. Polonsky K.S. Wei S. Concannon P. Iwasaki N. Schulze J. Baier L.J. Bogardus C. Groop L. Boerwinkle E. Hanis C.L. Bell G.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), and potentially at least five of these could be recognized by our antibody. Furthermore, two lens-specific splice variants, Lp82 and Lp85 of calpain 3, were found in rodent lenses (8Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 454-461PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ma H. Shih M. Hata I. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Curr. Eye Res. 2000; 20: 182-189Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, some of the multiple forms of calpain 10 observed in normal tissues may be splice variants generated by alternative exon usage. 4) Nonspecific immunostaining is also possible, and the various calpain 10 bands need to be sequenced. Future studies will be needed to determine whether calpain 10-specific proteins are associated with different functions or increased susceptibility to diseases. To understand the function of calpain 10 in pathologic conditions, we also tested whether calpain 10 was responsive to increases in cellular calcium using two model systems. 1) Selenite cataract: selenite cataract is caused by a well documented mechanism involving calcium accumulation in the nuclear region of the lens and proteolysis of the structural proteins called crystallins by m-calpain and Lp82 (23David L.L. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 1275-1283PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shearer T.R. David L.L. Anderson R.S. Azuma M. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Like m-calpain (25Ma H. Shih M. Throneberg D.B David L.L Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), calpain 10 transcripts increased rapidly in the outer regions of young rat lens 24 h after selenite injection before the onset of nuclear cataract. This may be because of up-regulation in response to increased calpain 10 activity or another calpain 10-dependent process such as signal transduction. Apoptosis was also increased in selenite cataract (26Tanaka Y. Fukiage C. Nakamura Y. Azuma M. Kim Y.H. Shearer T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and calpain 10 may influence apoptosis by controlling IκBα turnover similar to that proposed for calpain 3 (27Baghdiguian S. Martin M. Richard I. Pons F. Astier C. Bourg N. Hay R.T. Chemaly Y. Halaby G. Loiselet J. Anderson L.V.B. Munain A.L.D. Fardeau M. Mangeat P. Beckmann J.S. Lefrans G. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Calpain 10 is degraded by Lp82 and m-calpain in vitro, 3C. Fukiage, Y. H. Kim, and T. R. Shearer; unpublished data. and these enzymes could also contribute to the loss of calpain 10 in selenite cataract. 2) Treatment of αTN4–1 cells with ionomycin: the subcellular distribution of calpain 10 was unusual among the calpains with partial localization to the cell nucleus but not in association with DNA. This nuclear localization was enhanced in αTN4–1 cells by the elevation of intracellular calcium levels with 10 µm ionomycin, suggesting binding of calpain 10 to nuclear components involved in signal transduction. Thus, the two lines of evidence above clearly indicated that calpain 10 levels were influenced by changes in the calcium level within cells. At present it is not clear if this is a direct effect of calpain 10 activation or an indirect effect caused by other proteases. Calpain 10 lacks the typical calmodulin-like domain found in traditional calpains, and we have not yet been able to measure appreciable calcium-activated calpain 10 activity in animal tissues using zymography or fluorescence-labeled casein assays even when exogenous calmodulin was added. The acidic residues in domain III in m-calpain have also been proposed for targeting m-calpain to membranes (3Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and membrane binding was a prominent feature of calpain 10 in the present studies. Caution must be exercised because of the low amino acid similarity of calpain 10 to m-calpain, but the issues of calcium activation and calpain 10 targeting are important. The current studies have shown that calpain 10 protein is ubiquitously expressed in tissues from insects cells to human, in which it could potentially affect a number of tissue processes ranging from lens differentiation to susceptibility to diabetes. For example, calpain 10 may have a role in normal lens development and fiber differentiation, and the uptake of calpain 10 in the nuclei of lens epithelial cells could also be part of the mechanism for experimental cataract formation.

https://openalex.org/W2023363336,"Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an early response gene that is induced rapidly during in vivo situations of cellular growth such as liver regeneration. However, neither the physiological function nor the potential target genes of this transcription factor related to cellular proliferation have been identified in the liver or other tissues. We demonstrate here that endogenous ATF3 mRNA expression is rapidly induced up to 4-fold upon mitogenic stimulation of quiescent Hepa 1–6 mouse hepatoma cells. Overexpression of exogenous ATF3 results in a significant, dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis of up to 140% over control cells. ATF3-transfected cells also display significantly higher rates of [3H]thymidine incorporation in comparison with nontransfected controls in the presence of serum. Northern blot analysis and co-transfection experiments demonstrate that overexpression of ATF3 enhances cyclin D1 mRNA expression and activates the cyclin D1 promoter 2.5-fold when activating protein-1 (AP-1) and cyclic AMP response element (CRE) sites within the promoter are intact. ATF3-mediated promoter activation is reduced to 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively when the AP-1 or CRE sites are mutated, and mutation of both sites simultaneously leads to the complete abrogation of promoter activation. Furthermore, DNA-binding studies demonstrate that ATF3 binds directly to the AP-1 site within the cyclin D1 promoter. These results indicate thatATF3 expression stimulates hepatocellular proliferation, suggesting that this effect is mediated, at least in part, by the ATF3-dependent activation of cyclin D1 transcription.

Goyette M. Shank P.R. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3111-3117PubMed Google Scholar, 4Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin.

Among these genes are many of the proto-oncogenes implicated in cancer growth. Also induced during this immediate-early response is activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3).1 ATF3 encodes a 21-kDa leucine zipper transcription factor that shows high sequence homology to the murine transcription factor LRG-21 (6Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and to LRF-1 (rat liver regeneration factor-1) (7Hsu J-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). ATF3 is expressed at very low levels in normal, quiescent cells but can be rapidly and highly induced in different cell types by multiple and diverse extracellular signals including mitogens (serum, epidermal growth factor) (8Weir E. Chen Q. DeFrances M.C. Bell A. Taub R. Zarnegar R. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), cytokines (interferon γ, interleukin-4) (6Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and genotoxic agents (ionizing radiation, UV light) (9Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, ATF3 is highly expressed in situations of cellular growth or stress, such as liver regeneration, brain seizure, ischemia-reperfusion of the heart, or nerve damage (7Hsu J-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell.

ATF3 contains the basic region and leucine zipper (bZIP) motif characteristic of the bZIP superfamily of transcription factors, which includes members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, the Jun/Fos (AP-1) family, and the ATF/CREB family (of which ATF3 is a member) (7Hsu J-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). ATF3 can homodimerize, but it preferentially heterodimerizes with c-Jun, JunB, JunD, ATF2, and gadd153/CHOP10 (growth arrest/DNA damage C/EBP homologous protein) to facilitate DNA binding to AP-1 or ATF/CRE consensus sites. Depending on dimerization partner, target promoter, and cellular context, ATF3 can act either as a transcriptional activator or repressor (7Hsu J-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 14Hsu J-C.

Relatively little is known about the regulation or biological importance of ATF3 induction. Although most ATF3 studies to date have focused on DNA binding and heterodimer formation during cellular stress responses (Ref. 9Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar and references therein), a few studies have shown increased ATF3 expression in cancer cell lines (17Ishiguro T. Nakajima M. Naito M. Muto T. Tsurno T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 875-879PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ishiguro T. Naito M. Hanaoka K. Nagawa H. Muto T. Tsurno T. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1998; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and an interaction between ATF3 and the X protein of the hepatitis B virus (19Barnabas S. Hai T. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20684-20690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Tarn C. Bilodeau L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). X protein has been implicated in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma during chronic hepatitis B virus infection via transactivation of viral and cellular transcription (21Feitelson M.A. Duan L-X. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1141-1157PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATF3 expression has been shown to be elevated during the promotion and progression stages of the in vivoresistant hepatocyte model of liver carcinogenesis (22Liao D.-Z. Blanck A. Gustafsson J.-A. Hällstrom I.P. Cancer Lett. 1996; 100: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the biological functions of ATF3 have yet to be elucidated, there is strong circumstantial evidence that this transcription factor plays an important role in the regulation of normal and neoplastic hepatocyte growth responses. The expression of ATF3 and other immediate-early genes is followed by the sequential expression of a set of delayed-early genes and the onset of DNA synthesis (23Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This ordered progression through the cell cycle is controlled to a large extent by the cyclin-dependent kinases and their specific regulatory subunits, the cyclin proteins (24Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 25Palmero I. Peters G.

Biol. 1999; 472: 73-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of specific cyclins have been isolated and characterized in mammalian cells, and their temporal patterns of expression have been mapped to specific phases of the cell cycle. For example, cyclins A, B1, and B2 demonstrate maximal expression relatively late in the cell cycle and are thought to regulate the cell's transition to mitosis, whereas cyclins C, D1, D2, D3, and E reach peak expression during the G1 phase and appear to drive cells toward the G1/S transition (24Pestell R.G.

Previous studies have demonstrated an up-regulation of cyclin D1 during the G1 phase of the hepatic cell cycle following partial hepatectomy (28Lu X.P. Koch K.S. Lew D.J. Dulic V. Pines J. Reed S.I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11484-11492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), as well as during the continuous in vivo liver regeneration that occurs in chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis (29Albrecht J.H. Hoffman J.S. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G857-G864PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, amplification and/or overexpression of cyclin D1 has been implicated in many human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinogenesis (31Motokura T. Arnold A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Y.J. Jiang W. Chen C.J. Lee C.S. Kahn S.M. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Histopathol. 1997; 12: 1019-1025PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that cyclin D1 may be a critical mediator of the cell cycle in the liver and elsewhere. In the present study, we have utilized the Hepa 1–6 mouse hepatoma cell line (36Darlington G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 151: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to characterize the expression and biological effects of ATF3 during in vitro hepatic cell growth. We demonstrate that ATF3 is rapidly and highly induced in quiescent Hepa 1–6 cells following treatment with serum or hepatic mitogens. Based on these results and the findings of previous studies (7Hsu J-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Weir E. Chen Q. DeFrances M.C. Bell A. Taub R. Zarnegar R. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ATF3 is an important regulator of hepatocyte proliferation and that overexpression of ATF3 would lead to increased cellular growth via transcriptional activation of downstream cell cycle mediators. In the search for potential molecular targets of ATF3, cyclin D1 represented a logical possibility for several reasons. Cyclin D1 exhibits delayed-early expression kinetics in the liver, peaking mid-to-late G1 (3Thompson N.L. Mead J.E. Braun L. Goyette M. Shank P.R. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3111-3117PubMed Google Scholar, 5Taub R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 29Albrecht J.H. Hoffman J.S. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G857-G864PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that, from a temporal perspective, the pattern of cyclin D1 expression is consistent with that of an ATF3 target. More importantly, the cyclin D1 promoter contains two of the consensus binding sites for ATF3: an AP-1 (TGAGTCAG) site at −953 and an ATF/CRE (TAACGTCA) at −54 (37Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar, 38Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Finally, the cyclin D1 promoter has previously been shown to be activated by other members of the bZIP superfamily of transcription factors, including c-Jun (38Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), c-Fos, FosB (39Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H.

We report here a novel role for ATF3 during hepatocyte proliferation and suggest that ATF3 regulates hepatocyte growth in vitro by activating the cyclin D1 promoter. The Hepa 1–6 mouse hepatoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Hepa 1–6 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 µg/ml), at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto culture dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish (RNA studies), 7.0 × 106 cells/100-mm dish (protein studies), 1.0 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates (DNA synthesis studies), and 4.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates (reporter gene studies). All media, sera, and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc. All tissue culture plastics were from Sarstedt Inc., St. Leonard, QC, Canada. Cells were cultured as described above. 24 h after plating, cells were serum-starved for a further 36 h to synchronize cultures into quiescence. Following serum starvation, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of FBS (10%), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/ml), or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (20 ng/ml). At specified times, cells were washed once in cold PBS and scraped directly into TrizolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total cellular RNA was isolated per the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA (15 µg) from each time point was DNase-treated (DNA-freeTM, Ambion, Austin, TX) before being subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% formaldehyde/agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer (48 h). Membranes were UV-cross-linked and prehybridized at 42 °C for 1 h in 6 × SSPE (saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA), 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardts' reagent, 20 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide. cDNA probes for murine ATF3 (6Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. B. Drysdale, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, MD) and cyclin D1 (ATCC) were radiolabeled using 50 µCi of [α-32P]dCTP and the Rediprime® random primer labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radiolabeled cDNA probes were incubated with the membranes at 42 °C for 18 h in a solution identical to the prehybridization solution. Membranes were subjected to two low stringency washes (15 min each) in 2 × SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and one high stringency wash (15 min) in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C (cyclin D1) and 60 °C (ATF3). Northern blots were analyzed using a Molecular GS250 Imager (Bio-Rad) located in the Clarice Chalmers Molecular Imaging Facility, Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph. To normalize RNA load, membranes were rehybridized with a radiolabeled cDNA probe for murine 7 S RNA (Dr. A. Balmain, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA). Band intensity was quantified with the Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) software program and expressed as a percentage of the level at quiescence. A 1010-base pairEcoRI/BstEII cDNA fragment representing the entire coding region of murine ATF3 (6Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ expression plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using standard cloning techniques (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The cyclin D1 promoter/reporter constructs −964CD1LUC, −964AP-1mutCD1LUC, −1745CD1LUC, and −1745CREmutCD1LUC were constructed as described previously using the pA3LUC vector (38Albanese C. Johnson J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), and the −1745AP-1/ CREmutCD1LUC was generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis to mutate both the AP-1 site at −953 and the CRE site at −54 (Fig. 6 A). The cytomegalovirus (CMV Sport β-galTM, Life Technologies, Inc.) reporter plasmid (0.150 µg/ml) was co-transfected and used as a control for transfection efficiency in all transfection experiments. The fidelity of all plasmids was determined using restriction mapping and confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 DNA automated sequencer at the Molecular Supercentre, University of Guelph.Figure 6Activation of cyclin D1 by ATF3 in Hepa 1–6 cells. Panel A shows a schematic representation of the cyclin D1 promoter constructs in the vector pA3LUC, and indicates the areas homologous to the AP-1 (checkered oval) and CRE (gray oval) consensus elements, the transcriptional start site (black rectangle), and the luciferase coding sequence (striped box). Mutated promoter elements are indicated by an X. Quiescent cells were co-transfected (12 h) with 1.5 µg/ml of each of the cyclin D1 promoter constructs and 0 or 100 ng/ml of the pcDNA3.1/ATF3 expression vector. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Panel B shows the relative luciferase activity as compared with control (cell transfected in the absence of ATF3). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. (n = 15 separate transfections). Paired samples were compared by paired ttest; *, p < 0.01, and **, p < 0.05, represent a significant increase in promoter activity relative to control; δ, p < 0.01, represents a significant loss of promoter activity in the mutated constructs relative to their respective parental wild-type constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells were cultured as described above. 24 h after plating, cells were serum-starved for a further 36 h to synchronize cultures into quiescence. Following serum starvation, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA-liposome complexes were formed by incubating 0.05–1.5 µg/ml plasmid DNA and 12 µg/ml LipofectAMINETM for 30 min in serum-free DMEM. The DNA-liposome complexes were then added dropwise to each culture dish and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 12 h. Following transfection, cells were maintained in culture in serum-free DMEM. Transfection conditions for Hepa 1–6 cells were previously optimized to yield an average transfection efficiency of ∼50% (data not shown). Cells were cultured and transfected as described above. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and harvested in radioimmune precititation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in 1× PBS) supplemented with 100 µg/ml aprotinin, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Whole cell lysates (30 µg) for each sample were subjected to electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon™, Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electrophoretic transfer at 300 mA for 3 h. After transfer, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm transfer efficiency. Membranes were incubated for 18 h in a blocking solution (5% skim milk, 0.05% Tween 20). After blocking, the abundance of ATF3 protein was quantified using a rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody for ATF3 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h, washed (4 times) with the blocking solution, and then incubated (1 h) with a biotin-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10000, Sigma). ATF3 protein was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 48 h after transfection, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of FBS (0–20%) for 24 h and then labeled with 0.5 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (1.3 TBq/mmol; ICN, Aurora, OH) for 4 h. Radioactive medium was removed, cells were detached using 250 µl of cell lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 100 mm NaOH), rocked gently for 1 h, and harvested into 5 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (Ecolite, ICN). [3H]thymidine incorporation was assessed using a Tri Carb 2900TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard) and expressed as a percentage of control ([3H]thymidine incorporation in nontransfected cells). Data were presented as the mean ± S.E. of the mean (n = 15). Paired samples were compared by paired t test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were harvested with 150 µl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were snap-frozen on dry ice, thawed, vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. Cell extracts were collected and stored at −70 °C. To measure luciferase activity, 100 µl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) was added to 20 µl of diluted (1:10) cell extract. Each sample was vortexed for 3 s, and the light intensity was measured for 10 s in a Turner Luminometer 20e (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). To measure β-galactosidase activity, 50 µl of diluted (1:10) cell extract was added to 50 µl of 2× assay buffer (Promega) in a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 µl of 1m sodium bicarbonate (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured at 410 nm using a microplate autoreader (Titertek Multiskan® MCC/340, Flow Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). After adjusting for the dilution factor, luciferase values for each sample were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity and expressed as a percentage of control (luciferase activity in cells transfected in the absence of the pcDNA3.1/ATF3 expression plasmid). Data were presented as the mean ± S.E. of the mean (n = 15). Paired samples were compared by pairedt test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, harvested in 1 ml of PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 3 volumes of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT). The cells were disrupted with 20 up-and-down strokes with a type B Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min to isolate crude nuclei. The crude nuclei were resuspended in 1 volume of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 600 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT). The nuclei were extracted for 30 min with continuous gentle mixing and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The resulting nuclear extracts were collected and stored at −70 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously (6Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Hsu J-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, pre-annealed high pressure liquid chromatography-purified double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 (5′-AAAAAATGAGTCAGAATGGAGATC-3′) and CRE (5′-ACAACAGTAACGTCACACGGACTA-3′) sites in the cyclin D1 promoter were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) (underlines indicate consensus sequences). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides (25,000 cpm) were mixed with 1.5 µg of nuclear extract from nontransfected, serum-stimulated cells or ATF3-transfected cells and incubated in binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol) at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were electrophoresed in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel with Tris-glycine buffer. DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. To determine whether ATF3 represented the specific DNA-binding protein identified by the EMSA, a DNA-binding assay utilizing biotinylated oligonucleotides and streptavidin-agarose was performed as described previously (42Scotto C. Delphin C. Deloulme J.C. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7168-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The binding reaction was carried out as described above using 30–50 µg of nuclear extract and 0.6 µg/ml biotinylated AP-1 and CRE oligonucleotides identical in sequence to those used for the EMSA. Streptavidin-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was treated with 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA to block nonspecific binding, diluted 1:5, and equilibrated for 1 h in binding buffer. The pretreated streptavidin-agarose was subsequently added to the DNA-protein complexes and incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature with continuous mixing. The streptavidin-agarose was washed (3 times) with 1 ml of binding buffer. Proteins bound to biotin-target DNA were collected after a 1-h incubation in 1% SDS, 10 mm DTT and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described above. In an attempt to mimic the resting G0 state of the normal in vivo liver, cultured cells were synchronized into quiescence by serum deprivation before mitogenic stimulation. Endogenous ATF3 mRNA was expressed at very low levels in quiescent cells but was rapidly and highly induced as early as 0.5 h following treatment with 10% FBS (Fig.1 A). Densitometric analysis (Fig. 1 B) confirmed that ATF3 expression showed peak induction 1 h after serum stimulation and rapidly dropped off to below base-line levels by 4 h. Furthermore, treatment of quiescent Hepa 1–6 cells with either HGF (20 ng/ml) or EGF (10 ng/ml) resulted in a similar trend of ATF3 mRNA induction (Fig.1 C), although the magnitude of ATF3 induction by HGF was slightly higher than that induced by EGF (Fig. 1 D). Again, peak expression occurred 1 h after growth factor stimulation and t"
https://openalex.org/W2064727462,"ATM mutations are responsible for the genetic disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T).ATM encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation-induced double strand DNA breaks. Cells derived from A-T patients show many abnormalities, including accelerated telomere loss and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation; they enter into mitosis and apoptosis after DNA damage. Pin2 was originally identified as a protein involved in G2/M regulation and is almost identical to TRF1, a telomeric protein that negatively regulates telomere elongation. Pin2 and TRF1, probably encoded by the same gene,PIN2/TRF1, are regulated during the cell cycle. Furthermore, up-regulation of Pin2 or TRF1 induces mitotic entry and apoptosis, a phenotype similar to that of A-T cells after DNA damage. These results suggest that ATM may regulate the function of Pin2/TRF1, but their exact relationship remains unknown. Here we show that Pin2/TRF1 coimmunoprecipitated with ATM, and its phosphorylation was increased in an ATM-dependent manner by ionizing DNA damage. Furthermore, activated ATM directly phosphorylated Pin2/TRF1 preferentially on the conserved Ser219-Gln sitein vitro and in vivo. The biological significance of this phosphorylation is substantiated by functional analyses of the phosphorylation site mutants. Although expression of Pin2 and its mutants has no detectable effect on telomere length in transient transfection, a Pin2 mutant refractory to ATM phosphorylation on Ser219 potently induces mitotic entry and apoptosis and increases radiation hypersensitivity of A-T cells. In contrast, Pin2 mutants mimicking ATM phosphorylation on Ser219 completely fail to induce apoptosis and also reduce radiation hypersensitivity of A-T cells. Interestingly, the phenotype of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutants is the same as that which resulted from inhibition of endogenous Pin2/TRF1 in A-T cells by its dominant-negative mutants. These results demonstrate for the first time that ATM interacts with and phosphorylates Pin2/TRF1 and suggest that Pin2/TRF1 may be involved in the cellular response to double strand DNA breaks.

Identification of these ATM target proteins opens new avenues for understanding the physiological function of ATM as well as for explaining the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with ATM mutations in A-T patients and cells. Double strand DNA breaks induced by ionizing irradiation activate ATM and trigger multiple pathways to ensure that cells delay entry into mitosis following DNA damage to repair the damaged DNA before cell division. Many of these pathways ultimately lead to the inhibition of cyclin B/Cdc2, a major protein kinase that regulates entry into mitosis (7Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L.

Furthermore, ATM has recently been shown to regulate the interaction between telomeres and the nuclear matrix (35Smilenov L.B. Dhar S. Pandita T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, the yeast ATM homologues TEL1 and MEC1 control telomere length and the G2/M checkpoint; their mutations result in shortened telomeres, a G2/M checkpoint defect, and genomic instability (36Greenwell P.W.

Furthermore, TEL1 substitutes for ATM in rescuing telomere shortening, radiation hypersensitivity, and the G2/M checkpoint defect in A-T cells (39Fritz E. Friedl A.A. Zwacka R.M. Eckardt-Schupp F. Meyn M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2605-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ATM plays a crucial role in regulating telomere length and the DNA damage mitotic checkpoint. However, it is not fully clear how ATM is involved in coordinating these two events. Telomeres are composed of repetitive DNA sequences of TTAGGG arrays concealed by a complex of telomeric proteins that protect the ends from exonucleolytic attack, fusion, and incomplete replication (40Zakian V.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 41Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Sci. Am. 1996; 274: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 42Lundblad V. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence suggests that telomere length is regulated by telomeric DNA-binding proteins in yeast and mammalian cells (43McEachern M.J. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 44Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1996; 383: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 45Marcand S. Gilson E.

In human cells, inhibition of one such protein, TRF1, by the dominant-negative mutant increases telomere length, whereas overexpression of TRF1 accelerates telomere loss (47van Steensel B. de Lange T.

Science. 1995; 270: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These results indicate that TRF1 negatively regulates telomere maintenance. In our genetic search for proteins that are able to suppress premature mitotic entry induced by the mitotic kinase NIMA (never-in-mitosis A), we identified three proteins, Pin1–3, which are all involved in mitotic regulation (49Lu K.P.

Pin2 is identical to TRF1 apart from an internal deletion of 20 amino acids and forms a homodimer or heterodimer with TRF1 (50Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In cells, Pin2 is 5–10-fold more abundant than TRF1 (50Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and Pin2 and TRF1 are probably two alternatively spliced isoforms of the PIN2/TRF1 gene, as suggested by Young et al. (57Young A.C. Chavez M. Giambernardi T.A. Mattern V. McGill J.R. Harris J.M. Sarosdy M.F. Patel P. Sakaguchi A.Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For clarity, we will here use TRF1 for the 20-amino acid-containing isoform and Pin2 for the 20-amino acid deletion isoform, as they were originally identified (48Chong L. Van S.B. Broccoli D. Erdjument B.H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T. Science. 1995; 270: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar,50Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but refer to endogenous proteins as Pin2/TRF1 because it is still difficult to physically and functionally separate these isoforms. Pin2 and TRF1 contain a structural motif similar to destruction boxes present in mitotic cyclins, and their levels are regulated during the cell cycle, with a striking increase in late G2 and M (50Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), as is the case for mitotic cyclins (58King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Pin2 induces mitotic entry and then apoptosis in cells containing short telomeres (59Kishi S. Wulf G. Nakamura M. Lu K.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Pin2/TRF1 may play a role in the regulation of mitotic entry. However, little is known about the regulation and function of Pin2/TRF1 in cell cycle checkpoints. Here we show that Pin2/TRF1 formed stable complexes with ATM in cells. Furthermore, following ionizing radiation, activated ATM phosphorylated Pin2/TRF1 preferentially on Ser219 both in vitroand in vivo. Significantly, like Pin2, Pin2S219Ainduced mitotic entry and apoptosis and increased radiation hypersensitivity of A-T cells. In contrast, Pin2S219D or Pin2S219E completely failed to induce apoptosis and reduced radiation hypersensitivity of A-T cells. Interestingly, these phenotypes of phospho-mimicking Pin2 mutants were the same as those that resulted from inhibition of endogenous Pin2/TRF1 in A-T cells by dominant-negative mutants. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Pin2 on Ser219 by ATM probably inhibits its function after DNA damage. The mutants of Pin2 were generated using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis procedures and confirmed by sequencing. GST fusion proteins containing Pin2 and various mutants were purified as described (50Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For coimmunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer I (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Pin2/TRF1 antibody (5804), preimmune sera, anti-ATM antibody (Ab-3/ATM-6), or anti-c-Abl antibody (Ab-3) as described (50Shen M. Haggblom C. Vogt M. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the detection of the endogenous protein interaction with anti-ATM antibodies, nuclear extracts were used for immunoprecipitation as described (63Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). We used cell lysates that were five times more than those in inputs, and we only loaded half of the immunoprecipitates to the gel for Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. To detect binding of ATM and 35S-Pin2 in vitro, the cDNA encoding Pin2, Pin21–316, and Pin2317–419 were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and subjected to in vitro transcription and translation (Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met. Translated proteins were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C in 500 µl of buffer II (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with ATM that was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of lysates prepared from HeLa or A-T22IJE-T cells. After being washed three times with buffer II plus 0.25% Triton X-100, precipitated proteins were visualized by SDS-containing gels, followed by autoradiography and immunoblotting analysis with anti-ATM antibodies. To detect the interaction between GST-Pin2 proteins and ATM, ATM that was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of HeLa lysates was mixed with GST-Pin2 and its mutants. After incubation for 12 h at 4 °C in 500 µl of buffer II with protein A beads, complexes of beads were washed three times with buffer II plus 0.25% Triton X-100, and precipitated proteins were visualized by SDS-containing gels, followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-GST and anti-ATM antibodies, respectively. For the detection of in vivo phosphorylation of Pin2/TRF1, HeLa cells were labeled overnight with [32P]orthophosphate (54Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and Pin2/TRF1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Pin2/TRF1 antibodies, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phospho-amino acid analysis as described (50Shen M.

For transient expression of ATM, pcDNA3 vectors containing wild-type FLAG-ATM or its kinase-dead mutant were transfected to 293T cells, and expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated using M2 antibody, followed by Pin2 phosphorylation as described (7Banin S.

Briefly, cells were lysed by freezing and thawing in buffer III (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2% dodecyl maltoside, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNaVO4, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). ATM was then immunoprecipitated with anti-ATM polyclonal antibody (Ab-3). Immune complexes were washed twice with buffer III, once with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m LiCl, and twice with a kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 100 µm NaVO4, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 1 µg of GST-Pin2 or its mutant proteins and 5 µm [γ-32P]ATP were added; the reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min; and the reaction products were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Combinatorial immunostaining and telomere fluorescencein situ hybridization was carried out as described (66Scherthan H. Weich S. Schwegler H. Heyting C. Harle M. Cremer T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1109-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were washed once in Tris-buffered saline and incubated in 3.7% formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized and blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 2% normal goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Transfected HA-Pin2 and its mutants were first immunostained with the anti-HA (12CA5) antibody and with TRITC-conjugated mouse secondary antibodies. After immonostaining, the cells were fixed again under the same conditions as the first time. These prepared cells were then denatured in a hybridization mixture containing 70% deionized formamide, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 nm fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peptide nucleic acid telomere repeat probe (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) for 10 min at 80 °C. A hybridization was performed for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, DNA was counterstained with 0.5 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and preparations were mounted in antifade solution (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). For the preparation of samples for flow cytometric analysis, cells were harvested by trypsinization, and suspended cells were fixed and stained as described above. Flow cytometric analysis was performed by FACScanTM (Becton Dickinson). Transfected cells were gated by FL2 channel, and the intensity of telomere fluorescence was determined by FL1 channel as described (67Rufer N. Dragowska W. Thornbury G. Roosnek E. Lansdorp P.M. Nat.

To examine whether ATM is involved in the regulation of Pin2/TRF1, we first determined whether Pin2/TRF1 interacts with ATM.

Alternatively, the spin-relaxation lifetime was reduced by a factor of 12. This reduction is associated with the metallic nature of the step edge.

Nucleoside transport across cell membranes plays important roles both in prokaryotic and in eukaryotic organisms. For example, uptake is essential for nucleotide synthesis via salvage pathways in cells, such as mammalian bone marrow cells and many protozoan parasites of mammals, which lack de novo biosynthetic pathways (1Baldwin S.A.

In contrast the concentrative transport processes, which have been functionally identified in specialized tissues such as intestinal and renal epithelia, liver, and choroid plexus, are typically insensitive to NBMPR and have been divided into three major classes on the basis of their permeant selectivities (1Baldwin S.A.

These ∼650-residue proteins comprise a single family of transporters, unrelated to the equilibrative transporter family of mammals or to other known transporter families, which we have designated the CNT (concentrative nucleoside transporter) family. Members of the family with cit-type activity are designated CNT1, those withcif-type activity are designated CNT2, and those withcib-type activity are designated CNT3. Genome sequencing projects have revealed that CNT family members are present in other eukaryotes, including Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans, and also in prokaryotes. The best characterized example of a bacterial CNT family member is theEscherichia coli nucleoside transporter NupC, which differs from its eukaryote homologs not only in being considerably smaller (∼400 residues) but also in catalyzing the symport of nucleosides with protons rather than with sodium ions (13Craig J.E. Zhang Y. Gallagher M.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple CNT family members in mammals presumably reflects a variety of physiological roles for these transporters. Gaining a better understanding of these roles will require a knowledge not only of the detailed kinetic properties of the transporters, but also of their tissue and subcellular distributions. Northern blotting analyses have shown the expression of CNT1 and CNT2 mRNAs in many tissues (1Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), but in most cases it is uncertain whether these findings reflect the presence of physiologically significant amounts of transport proteins; results from Western blotting have so far revealed the presence of the rat cit-type transporter rCNT1 in liver, kidney, and intestine, and the cif-type transporter rCNT2 in liver and kidney (14Felipe A. Valdes R. del Santo B. Lloberas J. Casado J. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J. Henderson P.J.F. Gallagher M.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: P50-P51Google Scholar). Similarly, although site-directed mutagenesis experiments are beginning to reveal regions of the transporters which may be involved in substrate recognition (16Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Loewen S.K. Ng A.M.L. Yao S.Y.M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24475-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), their interpretation is very much dependent upon a knowledge of the arrangement of the proteins in the membrane. Initial hydropathic analysis of the cit-type transporter rCNT1 from rat jejunum, which was then the only eukaryote CNT family member to have been identified, tentatively suggested that this protein possessed between 10 and 14 transmembrane (TM) α-helices, and it was predicted that both the N and C termini of the protein were located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (7Huang Q.-Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17757-17760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence for this topology has so far been presented, and no predictions of the topology of the now extended CNT family, including shorter bacterial members, have been made. The aim of the present investigation was to gain a greater understanding of both the physiological roles and the structure-function relationships of a eukaryotic CNT protein. To this end polyclonal antibodies were raised against fragments of the ratcit-type transporter, rCNT1. The tissue and subcellular distributions of the transporter were assessed in a range of rat tissues by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Transporter topology was investigated by using the antibodies to detect recombinant rCNT1 following its production in CHO cells or in Xenopusoocytes. In combination with endoglycosidase F treatment, production in the latter system enabled us to assess the glycosylation status both of the wild-type transporter and of a series of glycosylation mutants. The resultant information, together with topological analysis of multiple CNT family protein sequences now available, has allowed us to predict a much refined model for the arrangement of rCNT1 in the membrane. Glycosylation sites were introduced into or removed from rCNT1 using a Quik-Change™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the plasmid pQQH (7Huang Q.-Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17757-17760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template. After mutagenesis of the potential glycosylation sites at Asn605 and/or Asn643, BamHI-XbaI cassettes (477 base pairs) encoding the mutated C-terminal region of the protein were used to replace the corresponding region in pQQH, yielding the constructs pSRH3 (N605T), pSRH4 (N643T) and pSRH5 (N605T/N643T). Similarly, after mutation of Gln6 to Thr to introduce a potential glycosylation site in the N-terminal region of the protein at Asn4, a 532-base pair NdeI-EcoNI fragment bearing the Q6T mutation was used to replace the corresponding region of pSRH5, yielding the construct designated pSRH22. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites were also introduced into rCNT1 by insertion of the 33-residue extracellular loop of human GLUT4, which contains the site of glycosylation of this transporter at Asn57 (18Fukumoto H. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Edwards Y. Pilch P.F. Bell G.I. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7776-7779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate this loop, oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify by polymerase chain reaction the region encoding residues 46–78 from human GLUT4 cDNA and to incorporate the flanking KpnI sites. The latter were used to insert the loop region into a unique KpnI site that had been introduced by mutagenesis immediately downstream of the nucleotides encoding Arg200 of rCNT1 in pSRH5. The presence of KpnI sites flanking the insert introduced a glycine-threonine sequence at each end of the GLUT4 sequence, yielding an insert that was 37 residues long. cDNAs for wild-type rCNT1 and hCNT1 (GenBankTM accession U62968) were subcloned into the vector pGEM-HE (19Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) for enhanced expression in Xenopus oocytes. Deletion of the regions encoding the first 173 residues of rCNT1 and the first 174 residues of hCNT1 was performed by a deletion polymerase chain reaction strategy using Pfu DNA polymerase. The forward primer (ATATGAATTCATGCAGCGGCCTGAGCAGCT) was designed to contain a start codon (underlined) as well as an insert sequence corresponding to the site of truncation. Because of sequence identity between rCNT1 and hCNT1 in this region, the same primer was used to construct both rCNT1/5′D3 and hCNT1/5′D3. The reverse primer corresponded to a region within the vector multiple cloning site (AAGGATCCCCGGGGAATTGATCTGCCAAAGTTG). Plasmid DNAs were linearized with XbaI (for plasmids encoding wild-type rCNT1 and glycosylation site mutants) orNheI (for wild-type and truncated rCNT1 and hCNT1 in pGEM-HE) and then transcribed with T7 polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINETM (Ambion) transcription system. Production of recombinant transporters in Xenopus oocytes and [14C]uridine uptake assays was then performed as described previously (7Huang Q.-Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E.

For preparation of membranes, oocytes were lysed at 0 °C by repeated pipetting in 7.5 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g to remove nuclei, membranes in the supernatant were collected, and subsequently washed twice, by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes (10 µg of total protein) from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant nucleoside transporters were suspended in 50 µl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.2, containing 50 mmEDTA, 0.2% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. They were then incubated overnight at 22 °C with or without 0.125 unit of endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For heterologous expression in CHO-K1 cells pDAH1 was constructed by subcloning rCNT1 cDNA into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen™) as an EcoRI-XbaI fragment from pSRH1, a derivative of pQQH from which anEcoRI site internal to the rCNT1 coding region had been silently removed by site-directed mutagenesis of Glu27 (GAA → GAG). CHO-K1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 46–67 and 505–524 of rCNT1 (designated anti-rCNT146–67 and anti-rCNT1505–524) were raised in rabbits and affinity purified using procedures described previously (21Davies A. Ciardelli T.L. Lienhard G.E. Boyle J.M. Whetton A.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 799-808PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum was also prepared against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein bearing residues 21–78 of rCNT1, prepared using the vector pGEX-KT (22Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The antibodies (designated anti-rCNT121–78) were purified by passage of the antiserum through a column of immobilized GST (Pierce) followed by adsorption to the fusion protein immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B. Tissues from male rats were homogenized at 4 °C in 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmEDTA, 2 µg/ml aprotonin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 µm leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml pepstatin A. After removal of nuclei and unbroken cells by low speed centrifugation, crude membrane fractions were prepared by centrifugation for l h at 100,000 ×g. For Western blotting, protein samples were electrophoresed on SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, incubated with 2 µg/ml primary antibody overnight and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Blots were developed with chemiluminescent substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunocytochemical investigation of liver and small intestine, tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound and frozen in isopentane. Cryostat sections (8 µm) on Vectabond™-coated slides were air dried for 1 h and then fixed with acetone for 3 min at room temperature. After incubation for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-rCNT1505–524 serum or preimmune serum, at a dilution of 1:100. Sections were incubated subsequently for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC-conjugate (Sigma), washed, then mounted in Vectashield® medium. For immunocytochemical investigation of kidney, the organ was perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS until the tissue surface was blanched evenly. After overnight incubation in 0.5m sucrose at 4 °C sections were quenched by incubation with 1 mg/ml sodium tetraborohydride and blocked using an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were stained as described above, except that anti-rCNT121–78 was used at a concentration of 2.2 µg/ml followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) in combination with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Extravidin™ (Sigma) to amplify the signal. Parallel sections were stained with 10 µg/ml control rabbit IgG or with antiserum raised against GST or against residues 477–492 of rat GLUT1, each at a dilution of 1:400. For immunocytochemical investigations of heterologously expressed rCNT1, transfected CHO-K1 cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS, then blocked with 6% normal goat serum in PBS for 45 min. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with 10 µg/ml anti-rCNT145–67 in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum (antibody buffer) with or without 0.1% saponin. After subsequent washing with PBS, they were incubated for 30 min with a goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate in antibody buffer with or without saponin, then washed and mounted as described above. Confocal microscopy was performed for all samples using an inverted Nikon Diaphot TMD fitted with a Leica confocal laser. The locations of TM helices in CNT family members were predicted by analysis of individual amino acid sequences using the hidden Markov model procedure of Sonnhammer et al. as implemented in the computer program TMHMM (version 1.0) (23Sonnhammer E.L.L. von Heijne G.

AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1998: 175-182Google Scholar). In addition, multiple sequence alignments were analyzed for putative TM helices using the TMAP procedure of Persson and Argos (24Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and the neural network approach (PHDhtm) of Rostet al. (25Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Analyses were performed on the following 18 members of the concentrative nucleoside transporter family: rCNT1 (GenBankTM accession U10279), hCNT1 (U62968), pkCNT1 (AF009673), rCNT2 (U25055), mCNT2 (AF079853), hCNT2 (AF036109), hfCNT (AF132298), F27E11.1 (AF016413), F27E11.2 (AF016413), NUPC_HELPY (AE000623), YUTK_BACSU (Z99120), YEIM_HAEIN (Swiss-Prot accessionP44742), YEIM_ECOLI (P33024), YEIJ_ECOLI (P33021), YXJA_BACSU (P42312), NUPC_ECOLI (P33031), NUPC_BACSU (P39141), NUPC_STREP (open reading frame present in contig 188 from the Streptococcus pyogenesgenome sequencing project, Oklahoma University). To investigate the distribution of rCNT1 in rat tissues, polyclonal antibodies (anti-rCNT1505–524) were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the region containing residues 505–524 of the protein. This region is hydrophilic and exhibits only 60% identity to the homologous transporter rCNT2. The specificity of anti-rCNT1505–524 was confirmed by its ability to recognize recombinant rCNT1 and hCNT1 (85% identical in sequence in this region) but not rCNT2 or hCNT2 on Western blots of membranes fromXenopus oocytes producing these proteins (Fig.1and data not shown). Western blotting of membrane fractions prepared from eight rat tissues showed strongly immunoreactive bands with an apparent size between 60 and 66 kDa in small intestine, kidney, and liver, but essentially no immunoreactivity of heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, or testis membranes (Fig.2). A faint cross-reactive band with an apparent size of ∼120 kDa was observed in brain; the identity of the corresponding protein, which was not visible in other tissues, is unclear. The presence of rCNT1 in kidney and liver confirmed the findings of other workers (14Felipe A. Valdes R. del Santo B. Lloberas J. Casado J. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Identical blots of small intestine, kidney, and liver membranes incubated with control rabbit IgG showed no immunoreactivity, confirming the specificity of the reaction (data not shown).Figure 2Western blot analysis of the distribution of rCNT1 in rat tissues. 70-µg samples of membranes prepared from rat brain (B), heart (H), small intestine (I), kidney (K), liver (L), skeletal muscle (M), spleen (S), and testis (T) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and then stained with 2 µg/ml affinity-purified anti-rCNT1505–524. The mobilities of standard proteins of known molecular mass are indicated by the arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The subcellular location of rCNT1 was examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Preliminary experiments revealed that paraformaldehyde fixation prevented recognition of the transporter by anti-rCNT1505–524; however, frozen tissue sections, fixed with acetone postsectioning, retained immunoreactivity and so were used for studies of intestine and liver. Specificity of rCNT1 staining was indicated by the absence of staining when preimmune serum was used (Fig. 3, insets). In sections of rat jejunum, strong staining for rCNT1 was observed at the brush-border membrane of the absorptive epithelial cells, whereas no staining was apparent on the basolateral membranes (Fig. 3, A and B). Staining of the absorptive epithelial cells was apparent from the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn to the tips of the villi, but was absent from the goblet cells. The location of rCNT1 is consistent with the reported presence of both cit- and cif-type sodium-linked nucleoside transport processes in rat and human brush-border membrane vesicles (26Iseki K. Sugawara M. Fujiwara T. Naasani I. Kobayashi M. Miyazaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1278: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Patil S.D. Unadkat J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: G1314-G1320Google Scholar). In contrast, nucleoside (formycin B) transport across the basolateral membrane of rabbit jejunal cells lacks sodium dependence and is probably mediated by an es-type transporter (28Roden M. Paterson A.R. Turnheim K. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 1553-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The abundance of rCNT1 at the enterocyte brush border, revealed by immunocytochemistry, suggests its involvement in the absorption of luminal nucleosides derived from the diet and from cells shed from the villus tip. Although enterocytes have been reported in some studies to possess the capacity for de novonucleotide synthesis, the energetically favorable salvage pathways are likely to be of particular importance for such rapidly dividing cells (29Young J.D. Cheeseman C.I. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Barrett K.E. Donowitz M. Gastrointestinal Transport. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 329-378Google Scholar). In liver, rCNT1 was found only in the hepatic parenchymal cells and was restricted to the bile canalicular membranes, being absent from the basolateral membranes (Fig. 3 C). The liver is the main nondietary source of nucleosides for cells, such as leukocytes a"

The observations provide evidence for a true accretion disk that is about the size of our solar system and located around a massive star. A model of the radio emission suggests the presence of a binary protostellar system. The primary protostar, G192 S1, at the center of the outflow, with a protostar mass of about 8 to 10 times the solar mass, is surrounded by an accretion disk with a diameter of 130 astronomical units (AU). The mass of the disk is on the order of the protostar mass. The outflow is poorly collimated with a full opening angle of about 40 degrees; there is no indication of a more highly collimated jetlike component. The companion source, G192 S2, is located 80 AU north of the primary source."

It is of importance to note that the redox status of Trx is essential for most, if not all, of its many vital functions. Consequently perturbations of the TrxR activity are implicated in a number of cell proliferative or immunological diseases, and the enzyme is increasingly being recognized as an important pharmacological target in a number of medical conditions (9Becker K.

Further insights into the functional roles the enzyme plays on a cellular level can be gained from a knowledge of the mechanisms regulating its expression. However, no reports exist regarding the structure or function of the promoter guiding TrxR1 transcription. Here we report the identification and characterization of the proximal promoter for human TrxR1 found to display the typical characteristics of a promoter for a housekeeping gene. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an ARE-regulated gene with transcription guided from a housekeeping-type promoter. We propose that this functional organization may be explained by the intimate link between intracellular signaling via reactive oxygen species (32Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and protection against oxidative damage, indicating a vital role played by TrxR1 for maintaining a functional balance in this regulation, and we propose the molecular mechanisms for how this can be achieved.DISCUSSIONThis is the first study of any mammalian thioredoxin reductase promoter; therefore no comparison of functional motifs conserved between species or between TrxR isoenzymes can be made. Nonetheless some conclusions can be drawn regarding the basal activity and structure of the promoter for human TrxR1 described here. The cloned 0.8-kb genomic fragment had strong transcriptional activity in the different cell types analyzed. Because the deletion analysis revealed that the promoter activity was maintained within the −115 to +167 region (the Δ3 construct), we considered this region the core promoter and concentrated on its characterization.The core promoter lacked classical TATA or CCAAT boxes but had an increased GC content and a probable CpG island involving the first part of the first exon. Using the shift assay approach four regions of the core promoter were found not to bind transcription factors present in crude nuclear extracts of A549 cells, whereas six specific fragments were identified as clearly binding nuclear proteins. We were able to identify transcription factors participating in the binding complexes for four of these six regions. The only regions producing shifts in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis for which we have yet to identify the participating transcription factors are those covered by oligo-6 and oligo-9. In the other analyses of the transcription factor complexes, it was clear that Oct-1 bound oligo-1, whereas Sp1 bound oligo-4, oligo-7, and oligo-10. However, it should be noted that oligo-2 and oligo-3 also contained possible Sp1 sites as predicted by the computer analyses; these were found to be nonfunctional in this analysis. Moreover, the shift of oligo-7 was different from that of oligo-4 and oligo-10 in that Sp1 antibodies abolished the shifted band instead of producing a supershift, probably indicating that Sp1 indirectly bound other transcription factors binding oligo-7 and that this protein-protein interaction and thereby the complete DNA binding was abolished by the antibodies. Oligo-4 and oligo-10 bound Sp1 directly, and these two fragments also shared a strong consensus tandem Sp1 site. Finally we also showed that Sp3 bound the same oligonucleotides as those complexed by Sp1. The overall structure of the core promoter, its basal activity, and the profile of binding transcription factors have led to some conclusions regarding the nature of the regulation of transcription for human TrxR1.Lack of classical TATA or CCAAT boxes, an increased GC content with functional Sp1 site(s) in the proximal promoter region, and a CpG island close to the transcriptional initiation site are features typical of housekeeping genes such as glycolytic enzymes, thymidylate synthase, adenine deaminase, and dihydrofolate reductase (44Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the latter being studied as a model housekeeping promoter (45Jensen D.E. Black A.R. Swick A.G. Azizkhan J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also Oct-1 is ubiquitously expressed and believed to govern the transcription of many housekeeping genes (46Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). TrxR1 mRNA is also well known to be expressed in many diverse lineages of cells and growth conditions as illustrated by the presence of TrxR1 mRNA detected in all human cells or tissues analyzed with general Northern blot screening methods (27Koishi R. Kawashima I. Yoshimura C. Sugawara M. Serizawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2570-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Gasdaska J.R. Gasdaska P.Y. Gallegos A. Powis G. Genomics. 1996; 37: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or by the fact that cDNA sequences for TrxR1 have been cloned from more than 30 different types of cells or tissues. 3As compiled from GenBankTM data in the NCBI UniGene cluster “Hs. 13046 TXNRD1” the human TrxR1 mRNA has been cloned as cDNA from at least the following cells or tissues: aorta, amnion fluid, B-cells, bladder, bone, bone marrow, brain, cervix, central nervous system, colon, ear, eye, foreskin, gall bladder, germ cell, head and neck, heart, kidney, lung, lymph, ovary, pancreas, placenta, prostate, skin, stomach, testis, thyroid, tonsil, uterus, and whole embryo. Additional data base mining revealed TrxR1 cDNA that was derived from at least liver, spleen, melanocytes, umbilical vein endothelium, retina, senescent fibroblasts, and T-cells. The transcriptional activity of the core promoter in the different cell types analyzed in the present study is hence in agreement, in principle, with the ubiquitous expression of the native gene. Based upon this expression pattern in combination with the structure and function of the core promoter as described herein, we thereby propose that TrxR1 should be considered to clearly belong to the class of human housekeeping genes. However, a significant difference from other housekeeping genes is found in the pattern of regulation of TrxR1 in response to cellular signaling.TrxR1 is known to display a significant and fast (within hours) increase of protein as well as mRNA upon treatment of cells with different exogenous agents. This includes human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells treated with epidermal growth factor, H2O2, or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (20Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) or thyrocytes treated with calcium ionophore (A23187) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (47Howie A.F. Arthur J.R. Nicol F. Walker S.W. Beech S.G. Beckett G.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 2052-2058PubMed Google Scholar). The latter agents induced TrxR also in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, although that induction was much less pronounced due to more than 10-fold higher basal TrxR levels in these cells compared with thyrocytes (48Anema S.M. Walker S.W. Howie A.F. Arthur J.R. Nicol F. Beckett G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (KM-102) both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in combination with A23187 or, alternatively, treatment with interleukin-1β or lipopolysaccharide significantly increased the TrxR1 mRNA levels within 4 h (27Koishi R. Kawashima I. Yoshimura C. Sugawara M. Serizawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2570-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In peripheral blood monocytes and myeloid leukemia cells (49Schutze N. Fritsche J. Ebert-Dumig R. Schneider D. Kohrle J. Andreesen R. Kreutz M. Jakob F. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as well as osteoblasts (50Schutze N. Bachthaler M. Lechner A. Kohrle J. Jakob F. Biofactors. 1998; 7: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) TrxR1 mRNA levels were shown to be increased above basal levels in a fast but transient manner by vitamin D3 treatment. How is the increase of TrxR1 levels upon these diverse exogenous stimuli transmitted? It is clear that housekeeping-type promoters also may have responsive promoter elements and distant enhancers or silencers. It is interesting to note that Sp1 and Oct-1 are known to be able to physically interact (51Gunther M. Laithier M. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 10: 131-142Crossref Google Scholar), an interaction that cooperatively stimulates expression in the case of the small nuclear U2 RNA gene (52Strom A.C. Forsberg M. Lillhager P. Westin G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Such Sp1/Oct-1 interaction may be one mechanism involved in executing the basal activity of the TrxR promoter. Binding of both Sp1 and Sp3 to the same GC boxes, as found in the present study, is known, and because Sp3 acts either as a repressor or an activator depending on the cellular context it has been suggested that variations in the cellular ratio between Sp1 and Sp3 may be another level of regulation. This mechanism of regulation has been reviewed elsewhere (43Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Also, both Oct-1 and Sp1 are, like many other transcription factors, known to be sensitive to their redox status (53Lickteig K. Lamb K. Brigman K. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 54Wu X. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Murphy B.J. Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The redox regulation of Oct-1 or Sp1 is, however, highly intricate, complex, and difficult to conclusively assess. For example, when transcription factors (including Sp1) are oxidized they often lose DNA binding activity (53Lickteig K. Lamb K. Brigman K. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 54Wu X. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Murphy B.J. Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However,in vivo induction of O-linked glycosylation of Sp1 upon cellular production of reactive oxygen species was found to increase its transcriptional activation (55Du X.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). On the other hand, oxidative damage to the Sp1-binding DNA motif in a promoter by formation of a single 8-oxodeoxyguanosine residue may disrupt the Sp1-dependent activation (56Ghosh R. Mitchell D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3213-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The promoter-driven regulation of TrxR1 transcription should certainly be studied further in diverse cellular contexts, also including distant regulatory elements. Yet an additional and alternative model for TrxR1 regulation can also be proposed considering the unique functional organization of a housekeeping-type promoter in combination with ARE-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.The presence of 3′-UTR AREs may enable a quick stabilization of mRNA and can thereby up-regulate protein levels in fast response to various signals (28Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Upon many different exogenous stimuli, ROS are also produced as common mediators for intracellular signaling (35Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 56Ghosh R. Mitchell D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3213-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). One regulatory protein that is rapidly up-regulated upon formation of ROS is the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (57Allen R.G. Tresini M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The stress-activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in turn up-regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) (58Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Interestingly MK2 was recently shown to induce stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs thereby executing their stabilization under intracellular formation of ROS (59Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26484-26491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TrxR1 contains several functional AREs (25Gasdaska J.R. Harney J.W. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25379-25385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Koishi R. Kawashima I. Yoshimura C. Sugawara M. Serizawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2570-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is also known to be up-regulated by many exogenous agents (see above), which in turn are known to mediate intracellular ROS formation as a common denominator (32Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 56Ghosh R. Mitchell D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3213-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition in cells, the TrxR1 protein has been reported to be rapidly inactivated by ROS targeting the selenocysteine residue (20Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This chain of events makes it possible to propose an interesting model for TrxR1 regulation and function. With a strong constitutive transcription (suggested here) combined with ARE-regulated mRNA turnover and generally a short mRNA half-life in nonstimulated cells (25Gasdaska J.R. Harney J.W. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25379-25385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), TrxR1 thereby has the inherent capacity for a fast response to an increase of intracellular ROS in their role of stabilizing the mRNA via MK2 and the ARE motifs; this would occur concomitant with a momentary inactivation of the enzyme (20Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, once more TrxR1 has been synthesized rapidly as a result of the stabilized mRNA, the antioxidant properties of the newly produced enzyme would then be able to carry the cells back to a correct basal balance of the intracellular redox status while having allowed a transient burst of ROS to be a necessary component for the many diverse systems of intracellular signaling. This proposed model for TrxR1 regulation needs to be confirmed and is now the basis for our further studies of the cellular function and regulation of TrxR1.In conclusion, we have cloned the proximal promoter for human TrxR1, and based upon its structure, basal activity, and the ubiquitous expression we have proposed that TrxR1 fulfills all the criteria of a housekeeping gene. However, a housekeeping gene with ARE-regulated mRNA degradation is to our knowledge a novel concept. This functional organization could possibly be explained by a role for TrxR1 in continuous protection of cells against oxidative damage while being in tune with and allowing bursts of reactive oxygen species generated at events of intracellular signaling cascades. The mammalian thioredoxin system consists of thioredoxin (Trx),1 thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and NADPH. Trx is reduced by TrxR and participates in many different types of reactions (1Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) including synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (2Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol.

It is of importance to note that the redox status of Trx is essential for most, if not all, of its many vital functions. Consequently perturbations of the TrxR activity are implicated in a number of cell proliferative or immunological diseases, and the enzyme is increasingly being recognized as an important pharmacological target in a number of medical conditions (9Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Muller S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6118-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms guiding the TrxR1 expression therefore also has medical relevance.

Although it is known that γ binds tightly to αβ, the binding affinity for each γ subunit to αβ, the domains on γ that interact with αβ, and the allosteric interactions between γ and the regulatory and catalytic regions on αβ are not well understood. We show here that the γ subunit binds to two distinct sites on the catalytic αβ dimer (K D1 < 1 pm, K D2 = 3 pm) when the regulatory GAF domains of bovine rod PDE6 are occupied by cGMP. Binding heterogeneity of γ to αβ is absent when cAMP occupies the noncatalytic sites. Two major domains on γ can interact independently with αβ with the N-terminal half of γ binding with 50-fold greater affinity than its C-terminal, inhibitory region.

The catalytic subunits contain GAF domains that are responsible for high affinity, noncatalytic binding of two cGMP molecules/holoenzyme. It is well established that relief of the inhibitory constraint on PDE6 arises from the binding of activated heterotrimeric G protein (transducin) to Pγ following photoactivation of the visual pigment, rhodopsin (reviewed in Refs.1Pfister C.

In addition, it has not been conclusively demonstrated whether both Pγ molecules bind with equal affinity to Pαβ to form the nonactivated holoenzyme (although two different binding sites on Pαβ have been inferred using mutant Pγ (10Berger A.L. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). Finally, recent evidence suggests that binding of activated transducin to PDE6 relieves inhibition at only one of the two active sites, further supporting the idea of catalytic subunit heterogeneity with respect to Pγ binding (11Melia T.J.

The C-terminal residues of Pγ (amino acids 77–87) have been shown to interact directly with the catalytic sites of Pαβ to inhibit catalysis (7Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Furthermore, Pγ does not bind with equal affinity to the two sites on Pαβ when cGMP occupies the noncatalytic regulatory sites located on the Pαβ dimer. We also demonstrate that the central region of Pγ stabilizes high affinity cGMP binding to the noncatalytic sites, and the affinity of the central region of Pγ exceeds by 50-fold the affinity of its C-terminal region. Finally, using a series of synthetic peptides, we identify important residues in the central region that contribute to the stabilization of Pγ binding to Pαβ.DISCUSSIONThis paper shows that Pγ binds to two distinct high affinity binding sites on Pαβ when cGMP occupies the noncatalytic sites. Our work also describes the reciprocal allosteric regulation of PDE6 resulting from Pγ binding to Pαβ and cGMP binding to high affinity sites in the GAF domains of Pαβ. Because no direct allosteric communication between the GAF domains and the active sites is detected, we conclude that the Pγ subunit is required to facilitate allosteric communication between the regulatory and catalytic domains of PDE6. Finally, we have mapped regions within the N-terminal half of the molecule that interact with Pαβ, some of which induce conformational changes at the GAF domain.Implications of High Affinity, Two-site Pγ Binding to Pαβ for PDE FunctionOur quantitative analysis of Pγ binding to Pαβ helps to make sense of the wide range of apparent binding affinities reported in the literature. The majority of studies of the Pγ affinity for Pαβ have been carried out with concentrations of enzyme much greater than the K D value for Pγ binding. Under these conditions, Pγ will bind in a stoichiometric manner (Fig. 1). Even when the appropriate model is applied to the binding data (i.e. Equation 2), it is difficult to extract meaningful values for the K D values. For example, we were unable to satisfactorily fit data obtained at >800 pmPαβ concentrations to Equation 2, primarily because the estimate of the free Pγ concentration is very uncertain.2 In previous reports where the PDE concentration was lowered into the picomolar range (5Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Prot. Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Hamilton S.E. Prusti R.K. Bentley J.K. Beavo J.A. Hurley J.B.

J. 1999; 340: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the binding affinities of Pγ for Pαβ were much closer to the values we report. Previous evidence supporting two distinct Pγ binding sites on Pαβ has mostly been obtained indirectly, based on heterogeneity in transducin activation of PDE6 (11Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F.

However, Berger et al. (10Berger A.L. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have reported two classes of Pγ binding sites on Pαβ when probed with a fluorescently labeled mutant of Pγ.The functional heterogeneity in Pγ binding to Pαβ is a consequence of the state of occupancy of the noncatalytic sites with cGMP (Fig. 2)—but not cAMP. Because the membrane-associated bovine rod PDE6 holoenzyme has one exchangeable and one nonexchangeable cGMP binding site (25Mou H. Grazio H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the very high affinity (K D < 1 pm) Pγ binding site may correlate with this nonexchangeable cGMP site. This Pγ binding site associated with the nonexchangeable cGMP site is unlikely to function during visual transduction. Instead, it may serve a structural role in stabilizing the native conformation of the PDE6 holoenzyme. This idea is supported by studies showing that mutations in the GAF domains of PDE6 (Ref. 37Gal A. Orth U. Baehr W. Schwinger E. Rosenberg T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 38Dryja T.P. Rucinski D.E. Chen S.H. Berson E.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Science. 1996; 272: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) can affect the levels of expression and/or activation of PDE6. It might also explain the difficulty in expressing functional PDE6 in various expression systems (40Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samual G. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been proposed (43Conti M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that a common regulatory feature of the N-terminal domain is to alter the inhibitory constraint on catalysis via conformational changes in the catalytic dimer. Almost half of the known PDE families (PDE2, PDE5, PDE6, PDE10, and PDE11) contain two tandem GAF domains (44Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) that in most cases code for functional, noncatalytic cGMP binding sites. For PDE2 and PDE5, binding of cGMP to the GAF domain induces a conformational change in the catalytic dimer that either directly or indirectly stimulates catalysis (31Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yamamoto T. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For PDE6, we show that loading the GAF domain with cGMP has no direct influence on PDE6 kinetic parameters (Table I).Nonetheless, cGMP binding to the GAF domain of PDE6 does induce a conformational change in the catalytic dimer. Occupancy of the noncatalytic sites enhances the interaction of Pγ (Fig. 2) or Pγ1–45 (Fig. 5 A) to the catalytic dimer. This effect is specific for cGMP (Fig. 5 A). Conversely, the addition of Pγ to bovine rod Pαβ enhances cyclic nucleotide binding affinity to the noncatalytic sites (Fig. 3) in a reciprocal manner. For cGMP, Pγ acts to restore high affinity binding to a low affinity class of sites on bovine Pαβ; the other, high affinity class of cGMP sites undergoes no change in affinity (25Mou H. Grazio H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For cAMP, addition of Pγ or Pγ1–45 to Pαβ increases the binding affinity 10-fold to both noncatalytic sites on Pαβ (Fig. 3).We conclude that unlike PDE2 or PDE5, the GAF domain in the PDE6 catalytic subunit is allosterically uncoupled from its catalytic domain unless Pγ is bound to bridge the two domains. Furthermore, the heterogeneity in Pγ binding to Pαβ suggests that only one Pγ binding site on Pαβ is sensitive to cGMP occupancy of the noncatalytic sites. Future efforts will identify which catalytic subunit contains the cGMP-sensitive Pγ binding site and the high affinity noncatalytic site on Pαβ.Pγ Is a Multi-functional Subunit with Several Sites of Interaction with the PDE6 Transduction ComplexThe Pγ subunit of PDE6 contains within its 87-amino acid sequence numerous sites of interactions with Pαβ, transducin, RGS-9, and perhaps other proteins (see the Introduction). In this study, we have focused on Pγ-Pαβ interactions and find that the N-terminal half of Pγ binds 50-fold more tightly to the catalytic dimer than the C-terminal region (Pγ63–87). This high affinity binding domain in the region of residues 18–41 of Pγ explains why αt* activation of the PDE6 holoenzyme sometimes displaces the inhibitory constraint of Pγ without causing complete dissociation of Pγ from Pαβ (5Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Prot. Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,47Clerc A. Bennett N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6620-6627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation of Pγ dissociation from transducin-activated PDE with loss of cGMP from the GAF domain (12Norton A.W. D'Amours M.R. Grazio H.J. Hebert T.L. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38611-38619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) also makes sense based on the reduced binding affinity of Pγ or Pγ1–45 in the absence of cGMP (Figs. 2 and 5).Within the central region of the Pγ subunit, amino acids 18–20 and 35–41 contribute to stabilizing Pγ binding to Pαβ (Fig. 6). Other Pγ interaction sites probably exist within this polycationic region that went undetected with our selected peptides, including potential sites of regulation via phosphorylation at Thr22and/or Thr35 (48Tsuboi S.

However, the N terminus of Pγ probably contains weak sites of interaction with Pαβ and may help stabilize a high affinity conformation of the 18–41 region of Pγ.Significantly, the one peptide that shows no detectable interaction with Pαβ, namely Pγ55–75, contains a major site of interaction with activated transducin, αt* (see the Introduction). A recent structural determination of the interaction of the C-terminal half of Pγ with αt* has shown that αt* binds to several residues in the vicinity of Trp70 of Pγ to cause the displacement of the C-terminal residues of Pγ known to block the active site (22Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).SummaryOur results extend previous models postulating two major sites of interaction between PDE6 and activated transducin, both of which are mediated through the inhibitory Pγ subunit. The extreme C terminus of Pγ functions to block catalysis at the active site but has relatively low affinity for Pαβ. It is the high affinity interactions of the central, polycationic region of Pγ (particularly residues 18–41) that stabilize binding to Pαβ, thereby insuring that a very small fraction of PDE6 holoenzyme is catalytically active prior to light activation. High levels of cGMP in dark-adapted photoreceptor cells result in saturation of the noncatalytic sites on PDE6, further enhancing Pγ affinity to one binding site on the PDE6 holoenzyme. Upon activation of the phototransduction cascade, binding of activated transducin to the PDE6 holoenzyme, specifically in the vicinity of Trp70 of Pγ, is sufficient to displace the Pγ C terminus and cause activation at one active site on Pαβ. (The very high affinity Pγ binding site (K D < pm) when cGMP is present likely prevents αt* displacement of Pγ at the second active site (11Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Norton A.W. D'Amours M.R. Grazio H.J. Hebert T.L. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38611-38619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).) At early times following light stimulation, αt* remains associated with the PDE6 holoenzyme and does not physically dissociate as a αt*-Pγ complex. Following PDE6 activation, cGMP levels in the outer segment drop and remain low until the inactivation process reinhibits PDE6. The positive cooperativity between the GAF domains and the central region of Pγ suggests that a sustained lowering of cGMP levels (e.g. during light adaptation) will lead to cGMP dissociation and a lowered Pγ affinity for Pαβ. This cGMP-dependent allosteric transition could cause the multi-functional Pγ subunit to become available to interact with RGS-9 to facilitate an enhanced GTPase rate on αt*, consistent with biochemical and structural studies (22Slep K.C.

Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), we still lack crystal structures revealing the interactions of each Pγ molecule with the α and β subunits of the rod PDE6 heterodimer. The present study provides the biochemical basis for understanding how the central and C-terminal domains of Pγ bridge the regulatory and catalytic domains of the rod PDE6 heterodimer to control the magnitude and duration of PDE activation during visual excitation, recovery, and light adaptation. The extent and lifetime of activation of the photoreceptor cGMP PDE1 (PDE6; EC 3.1.4.35) must be precisely regulated in rod and cone cells to control the exquisite sensitivity, speed, and adaptational properties of the visual transduction pathway in vertebrate photoreceptors. The membrane-associated rod photoreceptor PDE6 consists of a dimer of two homologous catalytic subunits (Pαβ) to which two low molecular weight inhibitory subunits (Pγ) bind (holoenzyme stoichiometry, αβγ2). The catalytic subunits contain GAF domains that are responsible for high affinity, noncatalytic binding of two cGMP molecules/holoenzyme. It is well established that relief of the inhibitory constraint on PDE6 arises from the binding of activated heterotrimeric G protein (transducin) to Pγ following photoactivation of the visual pigment, rhodopsin (reviewed in Refs.1Pfister C.

In addition, it has not been conclusively demonstrated whether both Pγ molecules bind with equal affinity to Pαβ to form the nonactivated holoenzyme (although two different binding sites on Pαβ have been inferred using mutant Pγ (10Berger A.L. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). Finally, recent evidence suggests that binding of activated transducin to PDE6 relieves inhibition at only one of the two active sites, further supporting the idea of catalytic subunit heterogeneity with respect to Pγ binding (11Melia T.J.

In the type II FAS system, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) enzymes are central to the initiation and elongation steps and play a pivotal role in the regulation of the entire pathway (9Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KAS I (FabB), II (FabF), and III (FabH) catalyze the condensation of malonyl-ACP with either acetyl-CoA (in the case of FabH) or the growing ACP-linked acyl chain to form the corresponding β-ketoacyl-ACP substrate for the subsequent reduction step in the elongation cycle catalyzed by FabG. FabH actsvia a ping-pong mechanism (10Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsay J.T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J.

Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) both utilize acyl-ACPs as primers. Also, unlike FabB and FabF, which are sensitive to both cerulenin and thiolactomycin (TLM), FabH is insensitive to cerulenin and much less sensitive to TLM (3Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O.

FabH also possesses acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activityin vitro, albeit at a rate ∼200-fold lower than that of the condensing activity. The physiological role of the transacylase reaction is unknown. The crystal structure of Escherichia coli FabH was recently solved (16Qiu X. Janson C.A. Konstantinidis A.K. Nwagwu S. Silverman C.

In addition, co-crystallization of FabH with acetyl-CoA provided direct evidence that Cys-112 is the catalytic nucleophile (16Qiu X. Janson C.A. Konstantinidis A.K. Nwagwu S. Silverman C. Smith W.W.

Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the similar folds, the substrate specificities for FabH from various bacterial species appear to be quite different.E. coli FabH was most selective for acetyl-CoA and inactive with longer chain acyl-CoAs (23Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bacillus subtilis FabH displayed low activity with acetyl-CoA but was active with 4- to 8-carbon straight-chain acyl-CoA and all branched-chain acyl-CoA molecules (24Choi K.H. Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), whereas the order of reactivity of Streptomyces glaucescens FabH was butyryl-CoA→acetyl-CoA→isobutyryl-CoA (25Han L. Lobo S. Reynolds K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Choi et al. (26Choi K.H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28201-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the FabH homolog of Mycobacterium tuberculosis prefers long-chain (C10-C16) acyl-CoA substrates over either short- or branched-chain primers, thus distinguishing it from the other FabH molecules. The role of FabH in fatty acid biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a clinically relevant Gram-positive bacterium, has been poorly understood. We have recently identified the S. pneumoniae homologue of E. coli FabH, and in this paper we describe its cloning and characterization. Our results show that S. pneumoniae FabH is able to utilize short (C2-C4) straight- and branched-chain acyl-CoAs, although activity with the straight-chain acyl-CoA was significantly higher. In addition, our studies have identified SB418011 as an inhibitor of S. pneumoniae FabH that is significantly more potent than TLM and cerulenin. SB418011 also inhibited E. coli andHemophilus influenzae FabH but not human FAS. The availability of purified and well characterized S. pneumoniae FabH will greatly facilitate structural and kinetic studies and the discovery of potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial inhibitors. Purified human testes FAS and chicken FAS proteins used for specificity assays were obtained from Dr. Zining Wu (Glaxo SmithKline, King of Prussia, PA) and Dr. Salih Wakil (Baylor College of Medicine), respectively. E. coli FabH was purified as described before (22Khandekar S.S. Konstantinidis A.K. Silverman C. Janson C.A. McNulty D.E. Nwagwu S. Van Aller G.S. Doyle M.L. Kane J.F. Qiu X. Lonsdale J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hexahistidine (His6)-tagged H. influenzae FabH was expressed and purified from the E. coli cell lysate 2D. Gentry, M. Grooms, S. Khandekar, and J. Lonsdale, unpublished results.Reagents otherwise noted were purchased from Sigma. The S. pneumoniae fabH gene was cloned via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) taking advantage of the conserved genomic structure between S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inspection of the publicly available S. pyogenes sequence revealed the presence of a contig containing the N-terminal coding region of the S. pyogenes fabH gene along with considerable upstream sequence. This contig was used as a query to search the S. pneumoniae sequence database, and a S. pneumoniae contig that was likely to lie upstream offabH was identified. The primers SPYOH1 and SPYOH2 (TableI) were designed from the upstream contig that shared homology with the S. pyogenes contig whereas the primers EKG8 and EKG10 were designed from the already available partialfabH gene sequence. PCR of S. pneumoniae genomic DNA using all four possible primer combinations yielded products around the expected size of 1.0 to 1.2 kilobase pairs. Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presence of the N terminus offabH. In this way, two of the S. pneumoniaecontigs were joined, and the full-length sequence of fabHwas obtained.Table IPrimers used in the present studyPCR primerSequenceEKG8AGAGGGTTTCACTACCAATCEKG10GACTGTGCGTCCATCCATCTFabH3′CGCGGATCCACAATGTGTTCACCACATGATTACFabH5′TGCGGAATTCCATATGGCTTTTGCAAAAATAAGTCAGGTSPYOH1GACGTCCTTCAAGTAATTCCSPYOH2AAAGACTGGCAGGGTTACGCTA Open table in a new tab A plasmid directing the overproduction of S. pneumoniae FabH with a His10 tag (decahistidine tag) and thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) at its N terminus was constructed. Primers fabH5′ and fabH3′ (Table I) were used to amplify fabH from S. pneumoniae genomic DNA. After purification from free primers, the PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and gel-purified. The gel-purified product was then ligated with gel-purified pET16b digested with NdeI and BamHI. Candidate plasmids containing correctly sized inserts were screened for over-production of S. pneumoniae FabH by SDS-PAGE. The inserts of plasmids shown to produce FabH were sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced by the PCR process. To obtain soluble protein, E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with vector pFabH1 containing the fabH gene. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to an optical density (A 600 nm) of 1.0 and then were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for additional 2.5 h (optical density of 2.6). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the resultant cell pellet was stored at −70 °C until further use. All lysis and purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. 10 g of E. coli cells over-expressing tagged S. pneumoniae FabH were resuspended in 300 ml of lysis buffer (buffer A) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm sodium chloride, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mmimidazole, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were lysed twice at 10,000 p.s.i. using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corporation). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (Sorvall RC-5B) at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a 15-ml Ni-NTA metal affinity column (Qiagen) at 2 ml/min equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 10-column-volumes of buffer A and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mmsodium chloride, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing FabH were pooled, dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and applied to a 15-ml Source Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 10-column-volumes of buffer B and then eluted with a 20-column-volume linear gradient of 0–1.0m sodium chloride in buffer B. FabH, which eluted at 300–400 mm NaCl, was next applied to a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (2.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, and 5 mm DTT. Yield of purified protein was ∼10 mg/gm wet weight of E. coli. SDS-PAGE, native isoelectric focusing (IEF), N-terminal sequence, and amino acid composition analyses were performed as described (22Khandekar S.S. Konstantinidis A.K. Silverman C. Janson C.A. McNulty D.E. Nwagwu S. Van Aller G.S. Doyle M.L. Kane J.F. Qiu X. Lonsdale J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of S. pneumoniae FabH was determined by size exclusion chromatography on analytical Superdex 200 or Superdex 75 (1.6 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. The column was calibrated with the following molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad): thyroglobulin (658 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1 kDa). A 200-µg (3 mg/ml) sample of purified S. pneumoniae FabH was injected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. S. pneumoniae FabH-directed acetoacetyl-ACP formation was specifically measured using [3H]acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP. Malonyl-ACP was generatedde novo by malonyl-CoA: acyl carrier protein transacylase (FabD) (12Tsay J.T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate [3H]acetyl-CoA is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid whereas the resulting [3H]acetoacetyl-ACP is not. Final reaction conditions in 25 µl were typically as follows: 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 175 µm ACP, 200 µm malonyl-CoA, 15 ng of purified S. aureusFabD, 3G. Van Aller, S. Khandekar, and J. Lonsdale, unpublished data. 40 µm acetyl-CoA, 0.5 µm[3H]acetyl-CoA (specific activity 7 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals), and 4 nm S. pneumoniae FabH. ACP, malonyl-CoA, and FabD were preincubated with buffer and DTT for 10 min at 33 °C prior to addition of acetyl-CoA and FabH. FabH was added last to start the reaction, and reactions were then incubated at 33 °C for 10–15 min. 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction, and stopped reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min prior to filtration. Reaction mixtures were filtered and washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid on Packard GF/C filter plates using a Packard Filtermate harvester. The filter plates were then dried completely at 60 °C, and the radioactivity was quantified using Wallac Supermix scintillation mixture and a Wallac Microbeta 1450 liquid scintillation counter. Malonyl-ACP formation was determined in the filtration assay format as described above for FabH. Final reaction conditions typically were 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 50 µm malonyl-CoA, 8 µm[14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity 56 mCi/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals), 15 ng of FabD, and 25 µm ACP. Reactions were stopped, filtered, and quantified as for the FabH filtration assay. To assay different non-radiolabeled acyl-CoAs as primers for FabH, a spectrophotometric assay was employed. α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase has been used previously to specifically quantify free CoA (27Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 10c-12cCrossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and was used as coupling enzyme to follow FabH activity. Reaction conditions in 50 µl of final volume were as follows: 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 500 µm NAD, 1 mm α-ketoglutaric acid, 0.025 units of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, 75 µm various acyl-CoAs, 20 µm malonyl-ACP, and 4 nm S. pneumoniae FabH. Assays were started by the addition of FabH and followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. For inhibition studies, cerulenin (0.011–666 µm), TLM (0.0034–200 µm) and SB418011 (0.0003–200 µm) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and tested for their ability to inhibit S. pneumoniae, E. coli, H. influenzae FabH, and human FAS proteins using the filtration assay as described above. IC50 values were determined by using GraFit version 4.09 fitting the data to the equation: v =V m/(1 + I/IC50). The concentration of FabH in the assay reactions was: 4 nm S. pneumoniae FabH, 0.5 nm E. coli FabH, and 1 nm H. influenzae FabH, respectively. The concentrations of ACP (75 µm for S. pneumoniae, 20 µm for E. coli, and 62.5 µm for H. influenzae FabH, respectively), malonyl-CoA (100 µm for S. pneumoniae, 40 µm for E. coli, and 90 µm forH. influenzae FabH, respectively), and acetyl-CoA (40 µm for S. pneumoniae, 10 µm forE. coli, and 18 µm for H. influenzae FabH, respectively) were based on the turnover ratio of FabD and K m values for malonyl-ACP and acetyl-CoA. IC50 values against human FAS were determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the oxidation of NADPH to NADP at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 4 mm DTT, 11 µmacetyl-CoA, 190 µm NADPH, and 10 nm human FAS. The reaction was started by the addition of 75 µmmalonyl-CoA and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-710 CD instrument using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette cell. Data (seven accumulations) were collected using a time constant of 4 s, at 50 nm/min, and with a 1-nm spectral bandwidth. A buffer-only spectrum was subtracted from the FabH spectrum, and the resulting ellipticity data, θ (in degrees), were converted to difference molar extinction coefficient data as described (28Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Concentration of residues was determined by absorbance at 210 nm using an extinction coefficient of 22 ml/mg and an average molecular mass of 110/residue. The data were analyzed for secondary structure prediction by Softsec for Windows Version 1.2 software provided by the manufacturer (Jasco). Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation was carried out while monitoring the secondary structure of FabH by CD at 220 nm. Purified FabH was diluted into denaturant to a 0.2 mg/ml final concentration at 20 °C and incubated for 10 min before taking the measurements. Dynamic light scattering analysis was performed on purified protein (1–6 mg/ml) using a DynaPro-MSTC instrument (Protein Solutions, Inc.) as described previously (22Khandekar S.S. Konstantinidis A.K. Silverman C. Janson C.A. McNulty D.E. Nwagwu S. Van Aller G.S. Doyle M.L. Kane J.F. Qiu X. Lonsdale J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TheS. pneumoniae fabH gene was cloned via PCR taking advantage of conserved genomic structure between S. pneumoniae andS. pyogenes as described under “Materials and Methods.” PCR of S. pneumoniae genomic DNA using all four possible primer combinations yielded products around the expected size of 1.0–1.2 kilobase pairs. Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presence of the N terminus of fabH. In this way two S. pneumoniae contigs were joined and the full-length sequence of fabH was obtained. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 324 amino acids (Fig.1). The calculated molecular mass of the encoded protein is 34,901 Da, and the isoelectric point is 4.9. The alignment in Fig. 1 was manually constructed with the aid of the sequence homology search algorithm PSI-BLAST. A FabH sequence profile was generated via five iterations of PSI-BLAST using the S. pneumoniae amino acid sequence as a query against an all-bacteria protein database. The profile was then used to search a Homo sapiens-specific protein database. The alignment was optimized by manual inspection using the x-ray crystal structure of E. coli FabH (16Qiu X. Janson C.A. Konstantinidis A.K. Nwagwu S. Silverman C. Smith W.W. Khandekar S. Lonsdale J. Abdel-Meguid S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36465-36471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the predicted secondary structure of the eukaryotic FAS-β-ketoacyl synthase domain. The species shown are a subset of the alignment containing 43 members of the FabH family representing 38 different species including green plants andPlasmodium falciparum. S. pneumoniae FabH is ∼41, 39, and 38% identical toB. subtilis, E. coli, and H. influenzae FabH, respectively and only 19% identical to the β-ketoacyl synthase domain of human and chicken FAS molecules. The active site of E. coli FabH comprises Cys-112, His-244, and Asn-274 (16Qiu X. Janson C.A. Konstantinidis A.K. Nwagwu S. Silverman C. Smith W.W. Khandekar S. Lonsdale J. Abdel-Meguid S.S. J. Biol.

Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in S. pneumoniae FabH (Cys-112, His-249, and Asn-279) (Fig. 1, highlighted in bold) as well as in other bacterial species (24Choi K.H. Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Choi K.H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28201-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Asn-343 is conserved across all bacterial FabH species, but is replaced by His-330 in eukaryotic FAS proteins. With the exception of Phe-157, the hydrophobic residues that make up the active site pocket in the E. coli structure, including Phe-87′ that protrudes into the active site of the opposite dimer-pair, are not rigorously conserved in S. pneumoniae(Leu-142, Phe-157, Leu-189, Leu-205, and Phe-87′). The E. coli FabH residues, Trp-32 and Arg-151, are invariant within the FabH family, presumably preserving their side-chain interactions with the adenine ring of CoA as suggested in E. coli but different in human and chicken FAS. In addition, the residues that form hydrogen bonds to pantotheinate, Gly-209 and Asn-247, are invariant in the FabH family but again are different in eukaryotic FAS. Although the high degree of sequence conservation within the bacterial FabH protein family easily distinguishes this member of the β-ketoacyl synthase superfamily from FabF and the eukaryotic fatty acid synthases, distant similarities can be found using sensitive search algorithms such as PSI-BLAST. Structural similarities between FabF and FabH are easily recognizable and, from this analysis, one would predict a similar structure for the corresponding domain in eukaryotic FAS. FabH was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal decahistidine-tagged fusion protein. FabH expressed well and was purified from E. coli cell lysate using a combination of Ni-NTA, anion exchange, and preparative Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography as described under “Materials and Methods.” The overall yield of the purified FabH was ∼10 mg/gm (wet weight) ofE. coli cells. Purified FabH was nearly homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A). N-terminal sequence analysis confirmed the 34-kDa band as N-terminal decahistidine-taggedS. pneumoniae FabH. The amino acid composition was in complete agreement with the predicted composition based upon the primary amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the expressed protein (not shown). Purified FabH migrated predominantly with a pI of ∼6.1 under native conditions (Fig. 2 B), which is in close agreement to its theoretical pI of 6.02 calculated from the amino acid sequence of decahistidine-tagged S. pneumoniaeFabH. Our previous studies showed that the molecular mass of E. coli FabH by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering performed under nondenaturing conditions was ∼65 kDa, implying the non-covalent dimeric nature of the protein (22Khandekar S.S. Konstantinidis A.K. Silverman C. Janson C.A. McNulty D.E. Nwagwu S. Van Aller G.S. Doyle M.L. Kane J.F. Qiu X. Lonsdale J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In agreement with the solution studies, the crystal structure of theE. coli FabH in the presence and absence of acetyl-CoA revealed a non-covalent homodimer (16Qiu X. Janson C.A. Konstantinidis A.K.

https://openalex.org/W2121817707,"The myeloperoxidase-derived oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is thought to contribute to endothelial dysfunction, but the mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect are unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that HOCl andl-arginine (l-Arg) react to form novel compounds that adversely affect endothelial function by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) formation. Using spectrophotometric techniques, we found that HOCl and l-Arg react rapidly (k= 7.1 × 105m−1s−1) to form two major products that were identified by mass spectrometry as monochlorinated and dichlorinated adducts of l-Arg. Pretreatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells with the chlorinated l-Arg metabolites (Cl-l-Arg) inhibited the A23187-induced formation of the NO metabolites nitrate (NO 3−) and nitrite (NO 2−) in a concentration-dependent manner. Preincubation of rat aortic ring segments with Cl-l-Arg resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of acetylcholine-induced relaxation. In contrast, blood vessels relaxed normally to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside. In vivo administration of Cl-l-Arg to anesthetized rats increased carotid artery vascular resistance. A greater than 10-fold excess of l-Arg was required to reverse the inhibitory effects of Cl-l-Argin vivo and in vitro. Reaction of HOCl withd-arginine (d-Arg) did not result in the formation of inhibitory products. These results suggest that HOCl reacts with l-Arg to form chlorinated products that act as nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors. The myeloperoxidase-derived oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is thought to contribute to endothelial dysfunction, but the mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect are unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that HOCl andl-arginine (l-Arg) react to form novel compounds that adversely affect endothelial function by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) formation. Using spectrophotometric techniques, we found that HOCl and l-Arg react rapidly (k= 7.1 × 105m−1s−1) to form two major products that were identified by mass spectrometry as monochlorinated and dichlorinated adducts of l-Arg.

Under inflammatory conditions, neutrophil activation initiates the assembly of cellular components of an NADPH oxidase that generates the oxidants superoxide (O 2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The heme protein myeloperoxidase (MPO)1 is an additional component of neutrophils that is released from intracellular granules into phagocytic vacuoles as well as the extracellular space (7Nauseef W.M. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase catalyzes the oxidation of chloride by H2O2, resulting in the formation of the chlorinating and oxidizing species hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (8Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E.

Immunopharmacology. 1997; 37: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hypochlorous acid reacts avidly with a variety of cellular substrates, including thiols, nucleotides, unsaturated fatty acids, and amines (10Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. Wardman P. Arch. Biochem.

It is estimated that nearly 50% of the H2O2 produced by an activated neutrophil is converted to HOCl by MPO and that, under inflammatory conditions, HOCl may reach concentrations to effectively damage host tissues (11Fliss H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 84: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase and HOCl are emerging as critical pathogenic mediators of vascular injury associated with sepsis, atherosclerosis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury (1Heinecke J.W. J. Lab. Clin.

In this respect, HOCl facilitates the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins by inhibiting TIMP-1 and enhancing the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (14Shabani F. McNeil J. Tippett L.

It also reduces α1-antiproteinase activity, leading to an increase in elastase concentration and tissue degradation at sites of inflammation (15Desrochers P.E. Weiss S.J. J. Clin.

The MPO/HOCl system also promotes atherogenesis via modification of the apolipoprotein moiety of very low density lipoprotein, thus promoting cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages (18Whitman S.C.

Previous studies show that HOCl converts α-amino acids to N-chloroamines (27Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A. Anderson M.M. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4997-5005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,28Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6864-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Herein, data are presented showing that HOCl reacts with the amino acid l-Arg to form novel chlorinated metabolites. These compounds have a potent inhibitory effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation in vivo andin vitro and display similar pharmacological properties as traditional nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors. It is postulated that chlorinated l-Arg metabolites (Cl-l-Arg) represent endogenous competitive inhibitors of the endothelial NOS isoform (NOS III). l-Arg, d-Arg,N α-acetyl-l-Arg, A23187, Ach, SNP, phenylephrine (PE), taurine, hypochlorous acid, and sodium phosphate were obtained from Sigma.N ω-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and nitrite assay kits were from Calbiochem. Diaion® CR11 beads were from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Water was deionized with a MilliQ system and had a conductance greater than 18 megaohms. Hypochlorous acid concentration was determined by monitoring the absorbance of hypochlorite at 292 nm (ε = 350m−1 cm−1) in 0.1 n NaOH using a Beckman diode array spectrophotometer model DU 7000. Ten-week-old male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan Breeding Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). All rats were maintained at constant humidity (60 ± 5%), temperature (24 ± 1 °C), and light cycle (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and were fed a standard rat pellet diet (Ralston Purina diet) ad libitum. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and were consistent with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication 85–23, revised 1985). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were isolated from aortas obtained from a local abattoir. BAECs were maintained in phenol red-free Medium 199 (M199) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% iron-supplemented calf serum, 10 µmthymidine and penicillin/streptomycin. Low passage (subcultures 4–7) BAECs were serum-deprived 18 h prior to study. Human leukemia (HL-60) cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Me2SO (1.3% v/v) was added to the cells for 7 days to induce differentiation to a neutrophilic phenotype. On day 7, differentiated HL-60 cells were washed with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and counted on a hemocytometer. The apparent rate constants of the reactions of hypochlorite with l-Arg and taurine were determined at pH 7.4 in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer. Phosphate buffer was prepared with Diaion® CR11 beads to remove trace metal contamination. Decay of hypochlorite was followed at 315 nm to avoid interference with the chlorinated l-Arg product that absorbed in the low UV range but did not absorb at 315 nm. Reaction traces were obtained on an Applied Photophysics SK.MV18 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, United Kingdom). First order exponential fits were performed with the Applied Photophysicssoftware using a Levenburg-Marquardt nonlinear fitting routine. Stoichiometry of the reaction of l-Arg (in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) with hypochlorite was determined on a HP 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Consecutive additions of limiting l-Arg were added to excess hypochlorite in a stirred 3-ml cuvette. Decay of hypochlorite was followed at 315 nm with an extinction coefficient determined to be 155m−1cm−1. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) was used to characterize the reaction products of HOCl andl-Arg. Samples of l-Arg or l-Arg mixed with an equimolar concentration of HOCl were flow-injected into the electrospray interface of a PE Sciex (Concorde, Ontario, Canada) API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode. Parent ion/daughter ion pairs were analyzed by MS-MS to identify fragments of the principal products formed. We will refer to HOCl + l-Arg reaction sample as Cl-l-Arg, recognizing that it is a mixture of mono- and dichlorinated species. Differentiated HL-60 cells (4 × 107 cells/ml) were suspended in 2 ml of PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mml-Arg. Cells were then activated with PMA (10 µm) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were next centrifuged for 5 min (2,000 × g; 4 °C), and the supernatant was removed and passed through a 0.45-µm cellulose filter. The UV absorbance spectrum of this material was then obtained. Trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) was added to the reaction mixture prior to monitoring product formation by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Reaction mixtures were separated by high performance liquid chromatography using a 10 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter, C-8 Aquapore reverse-phase column under isocratic conditions. The mobile phase (10 mm ammonium acetate) flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The column eluant was split and passed into the electrospray ionization interface of the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of ∼25 µl/min. Specific parent ion/daughter ion combinations were used in multiple reaction ion monitoring (MRM) to detect l-Arg (175/70) and Cl-l-Arg (209/70 and 243/146), respectively. Data were analyzed using commercially available software (MassSpec version 3.3, PE Sciex, Inc.). Nitric oxide production in BAECs was assessed by monitoring the formation of the metabolites nitrate (NO 3−) and nitrite (NO 2−). BAECs were pretreated with Cl-l-Arg (0–10 µm) in serum-free media for 1 h followed by washout. Cells were then exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 µm) for 2 h. Superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml) was added to the incubation medium to minimize cellular superoxide content. Aliquots of the media were sampled at the end of this period. Nitrate in samples was enzymatically reduced to NO 2− by treatment with Escherichia coli-enriched nitrate reductase. Total NO 2− was used as an index of NO production. Nitrite was detected using the fluorophore 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (Calbiochem). Under alkaline conditions, NO 2− converts 2,3-diaminonaphthalene to the fluorescent compound 1(H)-naphthotriazole. Nitrite concentration was monitored by the spectrofluorometric excitation of 1(H)-naphthotriazole at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm. A standard curve was constructed for NaNO2 (0.1–1,000 nm). Isometric tension was measured in isolated aortic ring segments of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Upon sacrifice, the aorta was excised and cleansed of fat and adhering tissue. The vessel was cut into individual ring segments (2–3 mm in width) and suspended from a force-displacement transducer in a tissue bath. Ring segments were bathed in a bicarbonate-buffered, Krebs-Henseleit solution of the following composition (mm): NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.6; NaHCO3, 27.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; MgSO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 1.75; Na2EDTA, 0.03; and glucose, 11.1. A passive load of 2 g was applied to all ring segments and maintained at this level throughout the experiment. At the beginning of each experiment, indomethacin-treated ring segments were depolarized with KCl (70 mm) to determine the maximal contractile capacity of the vessel. Rings were then thoroughly washed and allowed to equilibrate. In subsequent experiments, vessels were submaximally contracted (50% of KCl response) with PE (∼3 × 10−8–10−7m). When tension development reached a plateau, Ach (10−9 to 3 × 10−6m) was added cumulatively to the bath to evoke endothelium-dependent relaxation. Endothelium-independent relaxation was tested by cumulative addition of the NO donor SNP. In some experiments, ring segments were pretreated with Cl-l-Arg at concentrations of 0–10 µmfor 1 h, followed by thorough rinsing. The concentration of Cl-l-Arg in these experiments is expressed in terms of molar equivalents of arginine. Parallel experiments were performed using d-Arg and the product of HOCl + d-Arg (Cl-d-Arg). In other experiments, rings were pretreated with a fixed amount of Cl-l-Arg (10 µm) and increasing concentrations of l-Arg (0–1,000 µm), prior to monitoring endothelium-dependent relaxation. Additional control experiments were performed to compare the relative sensitivity of ring segments to inhibition of Ach-mediated relaxation byl-NAME. Real time data were collected for all experiments and downloaded to an IBM PC for analysis using WorkBench PC for Windows (Strawberry Tree, Inc./DASYTECH version 3). Dose-response profiles for different experimental conditions were analyzed and tested for differences in relaxation parameters. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg). A catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery for measurement of blood pressure. An additional catheter was inserted in the left jugular vein for drug administration. A Doppler flow probe (Transonic Systems, Inc.) was inserted around the right common carotid artery. The study was divided into three periods: 1) control infusion of 0.9% NaCl; 2) sequential infusion of 1.5, 15, and 150 µmol/kg Cl-l-Arg for 10 min each; and 3) infusion of 1.5 mmol/kg l-Arg. Vascular resistance was calculated from blood pressure and blood flow measurements (r = BP/F) for each infusion. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Dose-response profiles for different experimental conditions were analyzed and tested to determine differences in relaxation responses using the Sigma Stat statistical analysis program. Unpaired observations were assessed by one-way analysis of variance and multiple range tests. Hypochlorous acid absorbs maximally at 292 nm, while l-Arg has an absorbance (A) maximum at 210 nm at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1). On mixing HOCl and l-Arg, the HOCl absorbance disappeared, and a new broad band was evident at 252 nm, consistent with the formation of a new product(s) (Fig. 1). Using stopped-flow spectrometry, we found that HOCl rapidly reacted with l-Arg with an apparent second order rate of reaction of k = 7.1 × 105m−1s−1 (Fig. 1). As a control, we measured the reaction rate of HOCl with taurine, which yielded a value of 1.6 × 106m−1s−1 in agreement with previous measurements (10Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. Wardman P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To characterize the reaction products of HOCl andl-Arg, we employed positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Representative mass spectra for l-Arg and Cl-l-Arg are shown in Fig.2. Electrospray ionization ofl-Arg gave a major peak with an m/zof 175, corresponding to the molecular ion + H+ under these positive ionization conditions (Fig. 2). In the HOCl-treated sample,l-Arg was almost completely consumed, and major new products were detected. Peaks were observed atm/z 209/211 with a ratio indicating the presence of one chlorine. Peaks were also observed at 243/245 with a ratio consistent with the presence of two chlorines (Fig. 2). MS-MS analyses revealed that parent ion/daughter ion monitoring ofm/z of 175 and 209/211 share a common fragment with an m/z of 70. A pair of chlorinated species detected at m/z 146/148 was identified as a daughter fragment of the dichlorinated product (data not shown). To determine the sites of chlorine addition to l-Arg, we employed spectrophotometric techniques. Progressive addition of HOCl (0–1 mm) to a fixed amount of l-Arg (1 mm) resulted in an increased absorbance at 252 nm (A 252) consistent with the formation of an α-amino-monochloramine (Fig. 3; Ref.29Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). HOCl also increased the absorbance at 207 nm, indicating chlorination of a guanidino nitrogen (29Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In control experiments, we added HOCl to taurine, a simple amine that possesses an α-amino group but lacks a guanidino nitrogen. At molar ratios up to 1:1, we found an increase in A 252 but no change inA 207 (not shown). Thus, an α-amino-monochloramine derivative of taurine was the only product generated under these conditions. The lack of anA 207 peak in the taurine sample further supports our identification of the 207 peak in the l-Arg sample as an N-chloroguanidino derivative. Absorbance spectra for the HOCl + l-Arg reaction samples were corrected using molar extinction coefficients for chlorinated amines at 207 (ε = 3,000m−1 cm−1) and 252 (ε = 429 m−1cm−1) and are depicted in Fig. 3 (29Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data are consistent with HOCl chlorinating the α-amino group to form an α-amino-monochloramine, followed by chlorination of the guanidino group to yield a dichlorinated product (29Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The ratio of mono- to dichlorinated products formed under these conditions was 4:1, suggesting that the monochloramine is the principal metabolite generated. Based on the spectral analyses of the reaction products of HOCl and l-Arg, we have assigned structures for the mono- (N α-chloro-l-Arg) and dichlorinated (N α,N ω-dichloro-l-Arg) products as shown in Fig. 4.Figure 4Proposed structures of chlorinatedl-arginine products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We hypothesized that l-Arg chlorination products may share similar pharmacological properties with traditional NOS inhibitors. We therefore monitored the effect of Cl-l-Arg pretreatment on NO 3− and NO 2− formation in A23187-stimulated BAECs. Over a 2 h treatment period, 1 µmA23187 stimulated a 44% increase in NO 3− and NO 2− above base line (Fig. 5). Prior exposure of BAECs to Cl-l-Arg, followed by washout, inhibited theA23187-mediated increase in NO 3− and NO 2− formation in a concentration-dependent manner, with 1 µmCl-l-Arg blocking the peak increase in total NO 2− by 35% and 10 µm by 95% (Fig.5). Since our results suggested that Cl-l-Arg inhibits NO formation by endothelial cells, we assessed the effects of this reaction product on endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated blood vessels. Ring segments were incubated with Cl-l-Arg at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 µm. After a 1-h incubation period, the tissue bath was thoroughly rinsed, and residual effects of this treatment on vessel function were tested. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was monitored in precontracted ring segments by exposure to Ach. Endothelium-dependent relaxation in the absence of Cl-l-Arg treatment was normal (Fig.6). Cl-l-Arg pretreatment resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of Ach-induced relaxation with an ED50 and maximum inhibitory effect (R max) occurring at 5 and 10 µm, respectively (Fig. 6). On a molar basis, Cl-l-Arg was equipotent to the commonly used NOS inhibitorl-NAME in inhibiting NO formation (not shown). The inhibitory effect of Cl-l-Arg on endothelium-dependent relaxation persisted for time periods up to 2 h after washout. In contrast, endothelium-independent relaxation induced by the NO donor SNP was not altered by prior exposure to Cl-l-Arg, suggesting that the endothelium was the target of action of the chlorinated l-Arg metabolite (Fig. 6). The inhibitory effect of 10 µmCl-l-Arg on endothelium-dependent relaxation could be reversed by concurrent incubation of ring segments with higher concentrations of l-Arg (Fig.7). A 10-fold molar excess ofl-Arg to Cl-l-Arg resulted in ∼60% reduction in the inhibitory response to 10 µm Cl-l-Arg, while a 100-fold excess of l-Arg completely blocked the effects of Cl-l-Arg on NO bioactivity (Fig. 7). To test for the selectivity of Cl-l-Arg in the inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation, we performed similar experiments using d-Arg, which is not a substrate for NO production. A stock solution of Cl-d-Arg was prepared by reacting 100 mmd-Arg and 100 mmHOCl. Ring segments were incubated with unmodified d-Arg or Cl-d-Arg at a concentration of 10 µm for 1 h. Tissue baths were then rinsed thoroughly. In contrast to Cl-l-Arg, incubation of rat aortic ring segments with Cl-d-Arg did not inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxation (Fig. 8). Effects of Cl-l-Arg administration were tested in vivo by monitoring blood flow responses in anesthetized rats. Fig.9 shows that intravenous administration of Cl-l-Arg results in a significant increase in resistance to carotid artery blood flow. Sequential infusion of increasing doses of Cl-l-Arg resulted in vasoconstriction, as reflected by a dose-dependent increase in carotid flow resistance (Fig.9). The peak increase in vascular resistance occurred at 150 µmol/kg Cl-l-Arg. Subsequent infusion of a 10-fold molar excess ofl-Arg (1.5 mmol/kg) resulted in a 67% decrease in carotid resistance. In a final series of experiments, neutrophilic HL60 cells, bathed in PBS containing l-Arg, were stimulated with PMA to induce a respiratory burst. After 30 min, the PBS was collected for analysis. UV spectra revealed the formation of a product with similar absorbance properties as synthetic Cl-l-Arg (Fig.10). In the absence of PMA, a reduced absorbance corresponding to l-Arg was observed at 210 nm. Nondifferentiated HL60 cells bathed in PBS containing l-Arg yielded a similar UV absorbance spectrum (not shown). Analysis by LC-MS indicated the presence of two major peaks in PBS of PMA-treated cells with discrete retention times. One of the products had a retention time that was identical to l-Arg (2.75 min). The other peak (retention time = 2 min) was not detected in buffer samples in the absence of PMA (Fig. 10). The peaks were collected and directly injected into the interface of the mass spectrometer. The formation of parent/daughter ion pairs was assessed using MRM, which allows the detection of specific fragmentation products. MRM analysis revealed the presence of l-Arg andN α-chloro-l-Arg (175/70 and 209/70, respectively). No parent/daughter ion pairs corresponding toN α,N ω-dichloro-l-Arg (243/146) were observed. These results indicate that the primary chlorinated metabolite generated by neutrophilic HL60 cells is a monochloramine. Results of the current studies show that HOCl reacts withl-Arg to form novel chlorinated products that inhibit endothelial NO synthesis. The rate at which this reaction proceeds is rapid and is of similar magnitude as that reported for HOCl with other amino acids (10Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. Wardman P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Results of mass spectrometry and spectrophotometric studies facilitated the structural analysis of these l-Arg metabolites. Our data suggest that the α-amino and guanidino nitrogens of l-Arg are sites of HOCl-dependent chlorination. Previous reports show that the HOCl-dependent formation of amino acid-basedN-chloramines occurs via modification of the α-amino nitrogen (27Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A. Anderson M.M. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4997-5005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The reaction products of HOCl and l-Arg (at a 1:1 molar ratio) were the α-amino-monochloramineN α-chloro-l-Arg and the dichlorinated productN α,N ω-dichloro-l-Arg. The yield of N α-chloro-l-Arg was 4-fold greater, suggesting that the monochloramine is the predominant species formed under these conditions. We also found evidence for the formation of an α-amino-dichloramine (N α,N α-dichloro-l-Arg) when HOCl was added in excess of l-Arg; however, the yield of this product was low. Commercially available NOS inhibitors are widely used to study mechanisms of NO production and action in cells and tissues, and most inhibitors currently in use are structural variants ofl-Arg. The mechanism of action ofN ω-substituted analogues such asl-NAME is to compete with l-Arg for binding to the active site of NOS. The reversibility of NOS inhibition varies among these compounds (30Wong J.M. Billiar T.R. Ignarro L. Murad F. in Nitric oxide: Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Therapeutic Implications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 155-170Google Scholar). One of the goals of our study was to explore the pharmacological properties of the chlorinatedl-Arg metabolites. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that chlorination of l-Arg interferes with NO synthesis. Results of cellular studies showed that prior exposure of BAECs to Cl-l-Arg inhibited the A23187-mediated formation of NO 3− and NO 2− in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that Cl-l-Arg acts as an inhibitor of NOS III. Using an in vitro bioassay system, preincubation of rat aortic ring segments with Cl-l-Arg inhibited Ach-induced relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. The relative potency (ED50) of Cl-l-Arg for the inhibition of Ach-induced relaxation was ∼5 µm, which is similar to that reported for the commonly used NOS III inhibitorsl-NMMA and l-NAME (31Rees D.D. Palmer R.M.J. Schulz R. Hodson H.F. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 101: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). In contrast, the vasodilator response to SNP was not affected, revealing that vascular smooth muscle is not a target of Cl-l-Arg action, since the machinery required for vessel relaxation was fully intact. Rather, the inhibitory effect of Cl-l-Arg was mediated at the level of the vascular endothelium. In vivo studies showed that infusion of Cl-l-Arg in anesthetized rats resulted in a significant increase in the resistance to carotid artery blood flow, consistent with the vascular response to infusion of NOS inhibitors (30Wong J.M. Billiar T.R. Ignarro L. Murad F. in Nitric oxide: Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Therapeutic Implications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 155-170Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of chlorinated metabolites was specifically related to the modification of l-Arg, since incubation of ring segments with the reaction product of HOCl and d-Arg did not blunt endothelium-dependent relaxation. The production of NO from arginine is stereospecific for thel-isoform, since d-Arg does not bind to NOS, and the inhibitory effect of Cl-l-Arg on endothelium-dependent relaxation appears to display stereospecificity as well (32Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Mathie R.T. Griffith T.M. The Haemodynamic Effects of Nitric Oxide. Imperial College Press, London1999: 52-81Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, higher concentrations ofl-Arg competed away the inhibitory effect of Cl-l-Arg. A 10-fold molar excess of l-Arg (100 µm) reduced the inhibitory effect of 10 µmCl-l-Arg by ∼60%, and a 100-fold excess completely blocked the response to Cl-l-Arg. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of l-Arg under these conditions is not clear and may be more complicated than a simple competitive interaction between Cl-l-Arg and endogenousl-Arg. At higher concentrations, l-Arg may effectively displace Cl-l-Arg binding to NOS III inside the endothelial cell. Neutrophil adhesion contributes to the impairment of endothelial cell function in models of inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury, with neutrophil binding inhibiting both basal and stimulated release of NO (4Vinten-Johansen J. Zhao Z.Q. Nakamura M. Jordan J.E. Ronson R.S. Thourani V.H. Guyton R.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 874: 354-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). While some data suggest that increased vascular MPO content and HOCl formation contribute to endothelial dysfunction, few studies have directly assessed the effect of these molecules on NO bioactivity (26Leipert B. Becker B.F. Gerlach E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1676-H1683PubMed Google Scholar). A previous report showed that infusion of 2 µm HOCl into the guinea pig coronary circulation, followed by washout, resulted in a 50% reduction in basal flow (26Leipert B. Becker B.F. Gerlach E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1676-H1683PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the coronary flow response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators Ach, bradykinin, and adenosine was completely blocked by prior exposure to HOCl (26Leipert B. Becker B.F. Gerlach E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1676-H1683PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HOCl inhibited vascular relaxation was not addressed. Other studies suggest that the biochemical modification ofl-Arg results in the formation of an inactive substrate for NO production and that reduced NO bioactivity contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory cardiovascular disease (33Miyazaki H. Matsuoka H. Cooke J.P. Usui M. Ueda S. Okuda S. Imaizumi T. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In this respect, it was shown that methylation of l-Arg is enhanced in endothelial cells in response to hypercholesterolemia, with the formation of dimethyl arginine, an inactive substrate for NO production (34Ito A. Tsao P.S. Adimoolam S. Kimoto M. Ogawa T. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3092-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 35Boger R.H. Bode-Boger S.M. Szuba A. Tsao P.S. Chan J.R. Tangphao O. Blaschke T.F. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1842-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). In the current study, we present data showing that HOCl reacts with l-Arg, resulting in the formation of chlorinated metabolites. These products have a potent inhibitory effect on endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in vivoand in vitro. A physiological role for Cl-l-Arg is supported by our observation that neutrophilic HL60 cells generateN α-chloro-l-Arg, a component of synthetic Cl-l-Arg. We hypothesize that the MPO-derived oxidant HOCl decreases NO bioactivity by biochemical modification ofl-Arg substrate and that this pathway may represent a significant pathogenic mechanism underlying endothelial dysfunction in diverse cardiovascular inflammatory diseases."

Although its COOH terminus interacts with intermediate filaments, its NH2 terminus is important for its recruitment into HDs. To identify proteins that interact with the NH2terminus of human eBPAG1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, which uncovered a protein belonging to the LAP/LERP (for LRRand PDZ domain) protein family with 16 NH2-terminal leucine-rich repeats and a COOH-terminal PDZ domain. The gene for this LAP/LERP protein comprises at least 26 exons located on the long arm of chromosome 5. In most human tissues, several transcripts were detected differing in the coding region situated upstream of or within the PDZ domain. One of the encoded variants was found to correspond to the recently described protein ERBIN. In yeast and in vitro binding experiments, ERBIN was shown to interact not only with eBPAG1 but also with the COOH-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β4 subunit, another component of HDs. Antibodies raised against the COOH terminus showed that ERBIN is expressed in keratinocytes. In transfected epithelial cells the protein, however, was not localized in HDs but was either diffusely distributed over the cytoplasm or concentrated at the basolateral plasma membrane. Because ERBIN had been shown previously to interact with the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor Erb-B2, which in turn associates with the integrin β4 subunit, we suggest that ERBIN provides a link between HD assembly and Erb-B2 receptor signaling.

Specifically, cell transfection and yeast two-hybrid analyses have demonstrated that the last 768 residues of human eBPAG1 contain sequences important for their interaction with intermediate filaments (7Yang Y.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, BPAG1-knockout mice show discrete signs of blistering, most likely as a result of an impaired attachment of keratin-intermediate filaments to HDs leading to the mechanical fragility of basal keratinocytes (13Guo L. Degenstein L. Dowling J., Yu, Q.C. Wollmann R. Perman B. Fuchs E. Cell. 1995; 81: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). These mice also develop neurological degeneration with dystonia and ataxia, which results from the concomitant inactivation of the neuronal isoforms of eBPAG1, nBPAG1, or dystonin, which differ from eBPAG1 exclusively at their NH2 termini (13Guo L.

This region associates with the cytoplasmic domain of two transmembrane components of HDs, the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPAG2, also termed BP180) and the integrin β4 subunit (9Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). BPAG2 is a type II transmembrane collagenous molecule (16Giudice G.J. Emery D.J. Diaz L.A. J. Invest.

The large collagenous extracellular domain serves as a cell surface receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. The α6β4 integrin plays a key role in HD assembly and in cell adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 2Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest.

The cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β4 subunit consists of over 1000 amino acids and contains two pairs of type III fibronectin (FN-III) repeats separated by a connecting segment. It interacts with both BPAG2 and plectin, another cytoplasmic component of HDs (17Schaapveld R.Q. Borradori L. Geerts D. van Leusden M.R. Kuikman I. Nievers M.G. Niessen C.M. Steenbergen R.D.

The α6β4 integrin is a cell surface receptor that binds to various isoforms of laminin including laminin 5. Furthermore, α6β4 is implicated in signaling pathways that control cell growth and cell cycle progression (reviewed in Ref. 22Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Activation of the α6β4 integrin in response to clustering or cell adhesion results in the sequential phosphorylation of β4 and recruitment of the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2. In turn, Grb2 associates with exchange factor mSOS, leading to the activation of the Ras-Erk pathways. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 also occurs as a result of treatment of epithelial cells with epidermal growth factor, which has been associated with the disassembly of HDs and reduction of adhesion but is not associated with Shc recruitment (23Mainiero F. Pepe A. Yeon M. Ren Y. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the phosphorylation state of β4 controls the interaction of the various components of HDs with each other and the cytoskeleton. To identify proteins that interact with the NH2-terminal domain of eBPAG1 that might be implicated in the assembly of HDs and their regulation, we have screened, using the yeast two-hybrid system, a human keratinocyte cDNA library. We found that in addition to the two hemidesmosomal components BPAG2 and the integrin β4 subunit, eBPAG1 binds in yeast and in vitro binding experiments to a protein belonging to a recently recognized family of proteins containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and PDZ domain (LAP/LERP) 3The abbreviation LAP is also commonly used for leucine aminopeptidase. Thus, we suggest the unequivocal abbreviation LERP to refer to the family of proteins containing leucine-rich repeats and PDZ domain(s). 3The abbreviation LAP is also commonly used for leucine aminopeptidase. Thus, we suggest the unequivocal abbreviation LERP to refer to the family of proteins containing leucine-rich repeats and PDZ domain(s). (reviewed in Ref.24Bryant P.J. Huwe A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: E141-E143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We here describe the cloning of the full-length cDNA coding for this protein and the identification of several variants at the RNA level as well as their tissue expression. One of the splice variants of this novel protein corresponds to the recently described protein ERBIN, which has been found to associate via its PDZ domain with the COOH terminus of the tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor Erb-B2 (25Borg J.P.

Because ERBIN was shown previously to interact with the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor Erb-B2, which in turn associates with the integrin β4 subunit (26Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nistico P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp.

Yeast strain PJ69–4A (a gift of P. James, University of Wisconsin, Madison WI), the genotype of which is MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4, gal80, GAL2-ADE2, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, met2::GAL7-lacZ, was used as host for all yeast two-hybrid experiments. The yeast two-hybrid screening of a human keratinocyte cDNA library (CLONTECH) with the NH2 half of human eBPAG1, residues 1–1593 fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain (BD) in pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) as a bait, was performed as described previously (32James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis with two defined constructs in pAS2–1 or pACT2 (CLONTECH) was performed in two steps. After yeast transformation, double transformants were selected on agar synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking leucine and tryptophane. For each transformation eight colonies were arrayed in 96-well microtiter plates and then transferred onto agar SC medium lacking leucine and tryptophane (positive control), SC medium lacking leucine and tryptophane without adenine, and SC medium lacking leucine and tryptophane without histidine and supplemented with 2 mm3-amino 1,2,4-triazole. Growth was estimated after a 5-day incubation at 30 °C. Transactivation controls were systematically performed for each construct with the opposite vector without insert. Selected positive clones were further confirmed by colony-lift filter assay for β-galactosidase activity in the yeast strain Y190 as recommended by the supplier (CLONTECH). The insert of the prey plasmid 67, isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen of a human keratinocyte cDNA library with GAL4-BD-eBPAG11–1593 as a bait, was completely sequenced and compared with those in the GenBankTM data base. The 3′ end of EST N40602 was identical to the 5′ end of the insert of the prey plasmid 67, and its sequence was used to design the following primers: 1) 5′-CCTAAGTCAACAGAACAA; 2) 5′-GTCATGTGGTTCAGTCCTATTAG; and 3) 5′-ACTGGGAAGTTTCCTCAGAATGTC for a 5′-RACE with the kit from Life Technologies, Inc. (2.0 version) according to manufacturer protocol. Total RNA was purified from NHK cells grown in low Ca2+(0.07 mm) medium with the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 3 µg of total RNA/reaction. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. Then, the same strategy as described above was applied for a second round of 5′-RACE. The 3′ end of EST AA427786 was completely identical to the 5′ end of the longest 5′-RACE amplicon. The following three primers were designed based on the EST sequence and used in a second 5′-RACE: 1) 5′-TTCAACGAACCAATAGTCTCA; 2) 5′-TAGGAGGTCTTGAAGGTTTTCACAGCTGCTGAAGTGAATTGCTTGA; and 3) 5′-TAGGAGGTCTTGAAGGTTTTCAC. Sequencing of the cloned amplicons of the second nested PCR and data base analysis indicated that the translation initiation codon of the protein partially encoded by the insert of the prey plasmid 67 had been reached (see Fig. 1, A andB). To clone the entire cDNA encoding the novel protein, RT-PCR (Superscript one-step RT-PCR system, Life Technologies, Inc.) was performed with total RNA (0.2-µg/25-µl reaction mixture) isolated from NHK cells with three sets of forward and reverse primers, 5′-TATGACTACAAAACGAAGTTTGTTTGTG and 5′-GGTTTGAACAGTTTTGACCATA TTC, 5′-GCGGGCTCAAGTTGCATTTG and 5′-GGATTTTGTTTGGAGTGCCACA, and 5′-GCACTTGGAAAATGGAAACAAGTG and 5′-CCCCGCTTTTTTTGTCCACAGT, to amplify three overlapping cDNA fragments corresponding to the 5′ end, the middle part, and the 3′ end of the entire coding sequence, respectively (see Fig. 1, B and C). The RT-PCR amplicons were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) digested with EcoRV and completely sequenced. The three cDNA pieces were sequentially fused in pcDNA3 to obtain a full-length ORF. The cDNA sequence has been given the GenBankTM accession number AF276423. The isolated cDNA was later found to be a variant of ERBIN. To attach a HA tag either at the NH2 or COOH terminus of the identified protein, an adaptor coding for the HA tag and introducing an HpaI and a BsaBI site as well as an initiation and stop codon was inserted between the BamHI and NotI sites of pcDNA3, resulting in a vector called pcDNA3-HA1. The sequence of the forward primer was GATCCGCCACCAT GTTAACCTATCCATATGATGTCCCAGATTATGCTGATTAACATCGC, with the HpaI and BsaBI sequences underlined and the initiation and stop codons in bold. The reverse primer had a complementary sequence with terminal sequences creatingBamHI and NotI overhangs. To tag the novel protein at its NH2 terminus, the 5′ end was amplified with the first set of RT-PCR primers (see above) and cloned into pcDNA3-HA1 digested with BsaBI. To tag its COOH terminus, the 3′ end of its ORF was amplified with the forward primer of the third set of RT-PCR primers (see above) and the reverse primer 5′-GAGGAAACTTCTCGTACAATGATGAG and cloned into pcDNA3-HA1 digested with HpaI. Then the rest of the ORF was subcloned into these plasmids to obtain a full-length ORF. The COOH terminus of the identified protein, residues 932–1412, was fused in frame with the COOH terminus of enhanced GFP (EGFP) by transferring the SalI fragment from the yeast two-hybrid prey plasmid 67 into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) digested with XhoI. cDNAs encoding various portions of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β4 subunit were derived from expression plasmids described in detail elsewhere (19Geerts D. Fontao L. Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Purkis P.E. Wheeler G.N. Lane E.B. Leigh I.M. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3-HA2 (kindly provided by E. Sander, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam) allowing the expression of HA-tagged fusion proteins. The expression plasmid pMT2 encoding a HA-tagged COOH-terminal truncation of eBPAG1 encompassing residues 1–2161, HA-eBPAG11–2161, is described elsewhere. 4J. Koster and A. Sonnenberg, manuscript in preparation. Correctness of all constructs was verified by sequence analysis. Sequencing reactions were performed with Thermo Sequenase dye terminator cycle sequencing premix kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed on an ABI 373 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Various cDNA fragments encoding residues 805–1179, 805–1412, and 1307–1412 of the novel protein were amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase from variant 1 cDNA and cloned in frame with the COOH terminus sequence of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cut with SmaI. Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen) was transformed with these constructs or the vector pGEX-2T without insert. Expression of GST or GST-fusion proteins was induced by adding 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the broth medium for 3 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EDTA, and lysed by sonication. Purification of GST-fusion proteins was performed as described previously (19Geerts D. Fontao L. Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Purkis P.E. Wheeler G.N. Lane E.B. Leigh I.M. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined with the protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For pull-down assays, glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with bound GST or GST-fusion proteins were equilibrated in CHAPS buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), pH 7.5), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin diluted in CHAPS buffer. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-HA2-β41115–1752, pcDNA3-HA2-β41115–1328, or pMT2-HA-eBPAG11–2161 were lysed and scraped in ice-cold CHAPS buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin and 1 mm di-isopropyl fluorophosphate). Lysates were precleared by two incubations of 1 h at 4 °C with 10 µg of GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Precleared lysates were then incubated for 2–16 h at 4 °C with 200 pmol of GST-fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads equilibrated in CHAPS buffer. After five washes with CHAPS buffer, bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The level of expression of ERBIN transcripts in 24 human tissues was determined by using a human Rapid-Scan panel (OriGene Technologies). In each well of the 96-well microtiter plate, 25 µl of the following PCR reaction mixture was added: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm (each) dNTP mixture, 0.2 mm each of forward (5′-GTAGTGTGTCCTCCACAGCC) and reverse (5′-CCCCGCTTTTTTTGTCCACAGT) primers, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR conditions were: 1 × 94 °C for 90 s, 35 × (94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min), and 1 × 72 °C for 10 min in a GenAmp 9600 cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At the end of the PCR, two control reactions, without template and with 10 fg of pcDNA3 plasmid containing the 3′ end of ERBIN cDNA, were performed with the same PCR reaction mixture (kept on ice) and cycling conditions. The probe was labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) antigen using the PCR DIG labeling mix (Roche) with the forward and reverse primers 5′-TCCCCATTGTTCTCCTAGACAA and 5′-GAGGAAACTTCTCGTACAATGATGAG, respectively, from a plasmid derived from the yeast two-hybrid prey plasmid 67 and lacking both primer sequences used in the semiquantitative analysis of the transcripts from a human Rapid-Scan panel (see above). Labeling and Southern blotting were carried out exactly as described by the manufacturer. The Southern blot was developed with nitroblue tetrazolium salt and 5–5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates for the alkaline phosphatase coupled to the anti-DIG Ab. For Northern blotting, a 3.8-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment from ERBIN cDNA was used as template to synthesize by PCR an antisense DIG-labeled DNA probe with the reverse primer 5′-CCCCGCTTTTTTTGTCCACAGT. Northern blotting was carried out exactly as described by the manufacturer (Roche). The DIG-labeled probe was detected on the Northern blot with nitroblue tetrazolium salt and 5–5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates for the alkaline phosphatase coupled to the anti-DIG Ab. The different constructs in pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-HA1 were transcribed and translatedin vitro with the kit TNT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) as indicated by the supplier. A peptide corresponding to the 16 COOH-terminal residues of the novel protein (NH2-TFQNTVELIIVREVSS-COOH) was synthesized, isolated to 70% purity, and conjugated to Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde by the company Eurogentech (Belgium). Two rabbits were immunized with the prepared antigen and bled 3 weeks after the third immunization at Eurogentech. The antiserum from one rabbit was precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar), and IgG was isolated from this fraction after dialysis by chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B according to manufacturer protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Isolated IgG was purified by affinity chromatography (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar) on a column prepared by coupling 10 mg of COOH-terminal peptide dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, to N-hydroxy-succinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 15 h. Eluted anti-COOH-terminal peptide IgG (anti-ERBIN Ab) was finally concentrated by filtration on an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore), aliquoted, and stored frozen until use for Western blotting. When skin sections or cultured keratinocytes were subjected to immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining procedures, no specific signal could be detected with the anti-ERBIN Ab because of significant background. NHK cells were cultured in Keratinocyte-SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) or grown for 48 h in Ham's F-12:Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:3) as described previously (17Schaapveld R.Q.

The structural features that render it susceptible to shedding are poorly understood. We therefore analyzed the shedding of a series of mutant and chimeric L-selectin molecules. Although murine L-selectin is cleaved at a specific location in the juxtamembrane region 11 amino acids distal to the cell membrane, this cleavage has little sequence specificity. However, proline substitution at the P2′ or P3′ position or deletion of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain completely blocks the rapid phorbol ester-induced cleavage, but does not affect the slower basal proteolytic shedding. Insertion of the 15-residue membrane-proximal region (MPR) of L-selectin into the heterologous protein B7.2 results in a molecule that undergoes constitutive proteolytic turnover. In contrast, insertion of both the EGF domain and the MPR confers susceptibility to both slow constitutive shedding and the rapid proteolytic cleavage induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Membrane protein shedding is also implicated in several disease processes. Inherited mutations in the p55 TNF-α1 receptor lessen its sensitivity to proteolysis, cause its decreased proteolytic clearance from the cell surface, and result in a family of inherited autoinflammatory syndromes (13McDermott M.F.

L-selectin (CD62L) is a leukocyte transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates the initial adhesive interaction of lymphocytes to specialized vascular endothelial cells in lymph node high endothelial venules and of leukocytes to endothelium at sites of inflammation. In addition to being required for the homing of lymphocytes to lymph nodes (33Gallatin W.M. Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1983; 304: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar), L-selectin may transduce co-stimulatory signals for cell activation and for the up-regulation of integrin adhesiveness necessary for the transition from rolling to firm adhesion (34Murakawa Y.

The expression of L-selectin is differentially regulated by resting and activated lymphocytes at the transcriptional, mRNA, and post-translational levels (41Kaldjian E.P. Stoolman L.M. J.

In resting cells, L-selectin undergoes relatively slow, constitutive shedding. Stimulation by PMA or, for T cells, through the T cell receptor, induces the rapid up-regulation of shedding, releasing the soluble, ligand-binding ectodomain fragment into the supernatant and removing most of the protein from the cell surface within a few minutes (42Chao C.C.

Human neutrophils similarly shed L-selectin after treatment with chemotactic agents, phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharide, or calmodulin antagonists (44Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C.

The presence of the soluble L-selectin fragment in normal serum indicates that this proteolytic shedding process also takes place in vivo (46Schleiffenbaum B. Spertini O. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). L-selectin shedding regulates the rolling velocity of loosely adherent leukocytes along the endothelium, an early step in leukocyte-endothelial interaction (47Walcheck B. Kahn J. Fisher J.M.

Med. 1999; 189: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We have suggested that L-selectin cleavage may be required for de-adhesion during the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes through the high endothelial venule vessel wall and into the lymph node parenchyma (49Dailey M.O. Shimizu Y. Lymphocyte Adhesion Molecules. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1993: 75-104Google Scholar), a proposal supported by the observation that lymphocytes down-regulate L-selectin during migration through high endothelial monolayers in vitro (50Ager A.

The phorbol ester-induced proteolytic shedding of L-selectin is mediated by the same enzyme, TACE, that processes pro-TNF-α and is blocked by inhibitors of zinc-dependent metalloproteases (26Peschon J.J.

TACE cleaves both human and mouse L-selectin at homologous sites just external to the cell membrane (Fig.1), releasing the majority of the protein into the supernatant and leaving a membrane-retained fragment (MRF) consisting of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and the first 11 amino acids of the extracellular juxtamembrane region (54Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 55Zhao, L. C., Edgar, J., and Dailey, M. O. (2001) Dev. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar). Metalloproteolytic shedding of most proteins shows little specificity for the sequence around the cleavage site, and the structural features that determine transmembrane protein susceptibility to shedding are therefore poorly understood. One general feature of protease recognition is that the cleavage is positioned primarily with respect to the proximal extracellular globular domain, requiring only a susceptible membrane-proximal stalk of sufficient length to permit access of the protease to the substrate (1Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 3Schlöndorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, it has even been proposed that membrane secretases will cleave any surface protein that lacks a bulky globular domain close to the cell surface (4Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The shedding of human L-selectin is relatively sequence-nonspecific, and other determinants of protease recognition of membrane L-selectin have not been defined (54Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 56Chen A. Engel P. Tedder T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 182: 519-530Google Scholar, 57Migaki G.I.

In the present studies, we analyzed the regulation of proteolytic shedding in transfectants expressing a series of point and domain swap mutants of murine L-selectin. Although shedding is not blocked by most point mutations in the membrane-proximal region, some mutations and deletions completely block PMA-induced proteolysis. Surprisingly, however, these mutant molecules still undergo the constitutive metalloproteolytic shedding that is characteristic of unactivated cells, demonstrating that these two processes are inherently separable and may be mediated by different enzymes. Furthermore, while the short juxtamembrane region of L-selectin is sufficient to confer susceptibility to this basal cleavage, the EGF domain is required for rapid phorbol ester-induced shedding. The EGF domain therefore likely serves as a recognition motif for the phorbol ester-stimulated protease, enhancing its interaction with substrate and increasing the rate of proteolytic cleavage. An L-selectin-negative subclone of the mouse T lymphoma cell line TK-1 was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (20 mm), HEPES, and β-mercaptoethanol (50 mm). The stable transfectant lines were maintained in the complete medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). The following antibodies were used in this study: MEL-14: rat IgG2a, anti-mouse L-selectin (33Gallatin W.M. Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1983; 304: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar); T28: mouse IgG2b, anti-mouse L-selectin of the Ly22+ allotype (58Siegelman M.H. Cheng I.C. Weissman I.L. Wakeland E.K. Cell. 1990; 61: 611-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); GL-1: rat IgG2a, anti-mouse B7.2 (59Hathcock K.S. Laszlo G. Dickler H.B. Bradshaw J. Linsley P. Hodes R.J. Science. 1993; 262: 905-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). mAbs were isolated from tissue culture supernatants and conjugated to biotin or phycoerythrin (PE) in this laboratory or were used unpurified in two-stage staining (for GL-1). PE-labeled streptavidin and PE-conjugated goat-anti-rat Ig antibody were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Five × 105 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10% horse serum (FACS buffer) in test tubes. For testing PMA-induced shedding, the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml PMA at 37 °C for the times indicated, followed by staining with PE-conjugated MEL-14 for L-selectin expression, or with GL-1 followed by PE-conjugated goat-anti-rat Ig for B7.2 expression. For testing the effect of a metalloprotease inhibitor on PMA-induced shedding of L-selectin mutants or chimeric molecules, the cells were preincubated with 50 µm Ro 31-9790 (51Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) at room temperature for 20 min. Then, PMA was added at 100 ng/ml and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by staining as described above. For all experiments, cells treated with the same concentration of Me2SO as the experimental tubes were used as a control. To determine the Ly22 allotype of the L-selectin expressed in the transfectants, cells were stained with biotin-conjugated T28 followed by PE-labeled streptavidin. Cells stained with normal Ig were used as negative controls. All immunofluorescence was analyzed on a FACS Vantage (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). A peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of mouse L-selectin (NH2-RRLKKGKKSQERMDDPY-COOH) conjugated to diphtheria toxoid (Chiron Mimotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia) was used to immunize rabbits. Specific antibody was then purified by passing the resulting antisera over a column containing the cytoplasmic domain peptide bound to Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluting it at low pH. The purified antibodies were conjugated to Sepharose beads and used for immunoprecipitation. To confirm the specificity of the anti-cytoplasmic peptide antibody, normal spleen cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with MEL-14 or the polyclonal antibody and then analyzed by Western blot as described below. Both the monoclonal MEL-14 and polyclonal rabbit antibody precipitated protein with the mobility of murine lymphocyte L-selectin. In cross-clearing experiments, precipitating cell lysates with MEL-14 removed all such material precipitable with the polyclonal serum and vice versa (data not shown). Furthermore, PMA treatment results in the down-regulation of membrane protein detectable with both antibodies, as shown in several of the figures herein. Site-specific mutations, domain deletions, domain swap, and chimeric molecules were generated using a sequential PCR method. Ala184 (GCA) in the cDNAs of wild-type and all L-selectin mutants was changed to Glu (GAA) to mark them with the Ly22− allotype. The DNA sequence encoding the MPR of L-selectin was inserted between the transmembrane domain and extracellular domain of B7.2 to generate the cDNA of B7.2/MPR. Then, a HindIII site (AAGCTT) was introduced into the B7.2/MPR cDNA between the sequence of the MPR and B7.2 extracellular domain. The DNA fragments encoding the EGF domain, SCR domain, or EGF plus one SCR domain of L-selectin, with flankingHindIII sites, were amplified from wild-type L-selectin cDNA. These amplified DNA fragments were cloned into B7.2/MPR cDNAs using the introduced HindIII site to generate the chimeras B7.2/MPR/EGF, B7.2/MPR/SCR, and B7.2/MPR/EGF+SCR. Wild-type L-selectin, all L-selectin mutants, and the chimeric cDNAs were inserted into the pHSE vector, kindly provided by Dr. D. Raulet (60Pircher H. Mak T.W. Lang R. Ballhausen W. Ruedi E. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Burki K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The sequences of all of these mutants were verified by sequencing. The cDNAs encoding the wild-type L-selectin, L-selectin mutants, and the B7.2 chimeric molecules in the pHSE vector were used to cotransfect L-selectin-negative TK-1 cells with pCDNA3. After electroporation, the cells were selected in complete medium containing 2 mg/ml G418. Ten to 20 clones from each transfection were tested by flow cytometry after staining with PE-conjugated MEL-14 for L-selectin, or GL-1 for B7.2 expression. To ensure that endogenous L-selectin (Ly22+ allotype) expression was not induced, all clones positive for MEL-14 staining were confirmed to be Ly22-negative by staining the cells with T28. At least three clones of each transfectant with positive staining for MEL-14 or GL-1, but negative for T28, were used in these studies. Since the EGF domain deletion mutant (ΔEGF) cannot be recognized by either MEL-14 or T28, its expression was detected by Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibody specific for the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin. Plasma membrane expression of this mutant L-selectin was confirmed by its ability to be surface-labeled with 125I, and its smaller size distinguished it from endogenous wild-type L-selectin, as shown under “Results.” Untreated or PMA (100 ng/ml)-stimulated normal lymphocytes or transfectants were lysed, precleared with nonimmune rabbit IgG-Sepharose beads, and immunoprecipitated with Sepharose beads coupled to the rabbit anti-L-selectin cytoplasmic domain antibody. Eluates were separated on 10–20% Tricine-SDS gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and then probed with the polyclonal anti-cytoplasmic domain peptide antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection with LumiGLO Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Maryland) and Kodak BioMax Light-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cell surface proteins were labeled with 125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the glucose oxidase-lactoperoxidase method (61Morrison M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline. Three to 6 × 107 cells were labeled with 1 mCi of 125I in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm KI, 5 mm glucose, 0.4 unit of glucose oxidase, and 20 µg of lactoperoxidase. After labeling, cells were washed extensively and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. In mock labeling experiments, treating cells with unlabeled KI under oxidizing conditions did not cause any down-regulation of L-selectin (data not shown). For analysis of PMA-induced shedding, about 3 × 107 125I-labeled cells were left untreated or were treated with 100 ng/ml PMA, with or without pretreatment with Ro 31-9790 for 20 min. Cells incubated in the same concentration of Me2SO (0.1%) were used as a negative control. After the various treatments, the cells were lysed. Lysates and supernatants were precleared with Sepharose conjugated to irrelevant rat IgG2a antibody and then immunoprecipitated with protein G beads precoated with MEL-14 or, for B7.2 chimeras, with GL-1 antibody. Eluates from these beads were then resolved by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To remove N-linked oligosaccharides from the immunoprecipitated proteins, the antigens were eluted by boiling the beads in incubation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide) containing 0.5% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol and digested with N-glycanase (Oxford GlycoSciences, Wakefield, MA). Labeled proteins were detected by exposing dried gels to Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film at −70 °C. Treatment with phorbol esters that activate protein kinase C causes rapid L-selectin shedding from the surface of normal lymphocytes (43Jung T.M. Dailey M.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3130-3136PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.2 A, L-selectin expression on normal lymphocytes, detected by flow cytometric analysis using the mAb MEL-14, decreases rapidly after PMA treatment, with about 90% loss in 30 min. This down-regulation is not affected by treatment with inhibitors of serine and several other proteases (43Jung T.M. Dailey M.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3130-3136PubMed Google Scholar). 2M. O. Dailey, unpublished data. However, pretreatment of the cells with Ro 31-9790, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease inhibitor, blocks this down-regulation, suggesting that it is mediated by a metalloproteolytic secretase. To confirm that the down-regulation of L-selectin was due to a proteolytic mechanism, PMA-treated and untreated cells were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody specific for the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin and then examined by Western blot analysis, probing the membrane with the same polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2 B). In untreated normal lymphocytes, there is a broad 95-kDa band corresponding to intact L-selectin. In addition, there is a 6-kDa band that represents the protein fragment remaining in the membrane after L-selectin shedding. The presence of this MRF in the lysates of untreated cells shows that L-selectin undergoes base-line constitutive shedding in the absence of PMA, as we have demonstrated previously (43Jung T.M. Dailey M.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3130-3136PubMed Google Scholar). After PMA treatment, the 95-kDa band decreases in intensity, as expected, while that of the MRF increases at 5, 10, and 15 min after PMA treatment, reflecting its generation during proteolytic cleavage. Then, the intensity of the MRF band decreases as the fragments are gradually cleared from the cell surface. These data show that, upon PMA stimulation, L-selectin in normal murine lymphocytes is proteolytically cleaved and shed by a membrane metalloprotease in a process similar to that shown in human cell lines (54Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Based upon the mobility of the MRF bands, the proteolytic cleavage site appears to be the same for both the slow basal cleavage and the rapid PMA-stimulated shedding. To de"

Eukaryotic cellular responses to stress involve immediate post-transcriptional events within the maze of signal transduction pathways (1Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6084-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways often leads to further changes in gene expression and de novo synthesis of proteins that exert a protective effect on the cell. Whereas tremendous progress has been achieved in identification and characterization of key regulatory elements of separate signaling pathways, the complexity of coordination between simultaneously induced and transduced signals and the role of these interactions in the outcome of signaling are largely underestimated and yet to be understood. Activation of the stress-activated protein kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)1 and p38 kinases) and IκB kinases (IKK) followed by AP1/ATF- and NF-κB-dependent transcription orchestrates the rapid cellular response to a wide spectrum of exogenous and endogenous stress-induced agents. These pleiotropic mediators of stress-induced gene expression play a critical role in cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, and adaptive responses to changes in cellular redox balance (reviewed in Refs. 2Davis R.J.

The JNK and p38 pathways are preferentially activated by a diverse array of cellular stresses including UV light, x-rays, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), heat and osmotic shock, and withdrawal of growth factors. JNK are activated via upstream phosphorylation by two distinct JNKKs, JNKK1/MKK4/SEK1 (4Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Eleven different kinases capable of phosphorylating JNK and p38 kinases (including MEKK1–4, ASK1 and -2, TAK1, and others) have been identified as upstream activators of the JNK/p38 pathway (reviewed in Ref. 2Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms of their activation by stress are not yet comprehended in full. The outcome of JNK/p38 signaling is stress-inducible phosphorylation-dependent activation of their substrate proteins, which include transcription factors (c-Jun, ATF2, Elk1, etc.), apoptosis regulators (Bcl2, Bid, etc.), and other effectors. Modulation of gene expression due to an increase in transactivation potential and protein stability of proteins phosphorylated by JNK/p38 are among the mechanisms of JNK/p38-mediated effects. Recent evidence for the role of JNK/p38 kinases in stabilization of the short lived mRNAs of cytokines and growth factors (10Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M.

NF-κB is a dimeric transcription factor composed of members of the Rel family. A large number of stress stimuli including UV irradiation, ionizing radiation, viral infection, and reactive oxygen species can activate NF-κB and its target genes. These target genes include those involved in the immune response, inflammatory response, cell adhesion, cell growth, and apoptosis. The activity of NF-κB is tightly regulated at the level of its localization by a family of inhibitory proteins, IκBs, that sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBs in response to stress results in the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB (reviewed in Ref. 15Verma I.M. Stevenson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11758-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Most of the stress stimuli, which induce NF-κB, trigger a cascade of events resulting in the activation of IκB kinases (IKK). IKK is a large (>700-kDa) multicomponent enzyme complex containing two closely related kinase subunits with identical structural domains, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and two accessory proteins, IKKγ and IKAP (reviewed in Ref. 3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Two members of the MAP kinase family, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and MEKK1, have been shown to directly interact with IKK and activate the kinase subunits in experiments based on overexpression of the recombinant proteins. The requirements of NIK and MEKK1 for activation of IKK by the relevant physiological stimuli have not been proven, and the upstream kinases in this signaling pathway remain to be identified (reviewed in Ref. 3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). As an outcome of their activation, IKK mediate phosphorylation of IκB on two critical serine residues (e.g. serines 32 and 36 in IκBα, serines 19 and 23 in IκBβ, and serines 18 and 22 in IκBε). This phosphorylation serves as a recognition signal for seven WD40 repeats located at the carboxyl-terminal domains of β-TrCP (16Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V.

Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Binding of β-TrCP/Fbw1a (or its close relative HOS/Fbw1b) proteins to IκB mediates IκB ubiquitination (and subsequent 26S proteasome-dependent degradation) through recruitment of the SCFβ-TrCP-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (reviewed in Refs. 18Deshaies R.J.

Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The endogenous levels of β-TrCP are low. These levels can be up-regulated in some cells by the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (31Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the functional Tcf was apparently required for up-regulation of β-TrCP, we have failed to completely inhibit the effect of Wnt (but not β-catenin) on β-TrCP levels by co-expression of the dominant negative Tcf4. Moreover, it was consistently observed that expression of Wnt was more efficient in the increase in β-TrCP levels and NF-κB transcriptional activity as compared with expression of the stable β-catenin mutant (31Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Since it has been shown that Wnt exerts some of its effects in a β-catenin-independent manner via the JNK pathway (32Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the activation of JNK signaling can actually regulate the abundance and activity of β-TrCP. In this study, we first demonstrate that cellular stress and induction of stress-activated protein kinases increase the levels and activities of β-TrCP via stabilization of β-TrCP mRNA. These data provide a mechanism for the positive cooperation between activated JNK and IKK in regulating the NF-κB transcriptional activity in response to cellular stress. The constitutively active IKKβS177E,S181E (IKKSE), 2x-κB-luciferase and glutathioneS-transferase-IκB expression vectors (33Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Constitutively active MEKK1 (ΔMEKK1) and dominant negative SEK1/MKK4 (SEKAL) were kindly provided by A. Minden and J. Woodgett. The expression vector for constitutively active MEK1 (MEKEL) was a kind gift of S. Aaronson. β-TrCP expression vector containing the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) was a gift of R.

Monoclonal antibodies against FLAG tag (M2; Sigma), MEKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and SEK1 (New England Biolabs) were purchased. Polyclonal antibodies against β-TrCP were raised by Zymed Laboratories Inc. against synthetic peptide encompassing amino acid residues NSSEREDCNNGEPPRKIIPEKNSLRQTY of β-TrCP and purified via a peptide affinity column. Twenty µg of total RNA isolated from freshly harvested cells using TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) was subjected to Northern blotting analysis using random primer-labeled probes for human β-TrCP. The membranes were stripped and rehybridized with a probe to 7S RNA to verify that equal amounts of RNA were loaded and transferred. A nuclear run-on assay was performed as previously described (31Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). HeLa epithelial cells and 293T human embryo kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were performed by the calcium precipitate method or lipofection (LipofectAMINE Plus; Life Technologies, Inc.). The overall amount of DNA in transfection mixtures was kept constant by the addition of pCDNA3. Preparation of cell lysates and immunoblotting were performed as described elsewhere (17Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, for detection of endogenous β-TrCP, 1 mg of protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with β-TrCP antibody (1 µg), separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with β-TrCP antibody at a 1:500 dilution. Membranes were developed with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to film. Loading of cell lysates on gels was normalized for protein concentration. The luciferase assay was performed using a kit (Promega), and the data were normalized per transfection efficiency. JNK and IKK activity in whole cell extracts (10 µg) was assessed in the solid phase kinase assay with bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (amino acids 5–89) or glutathioneS-transferase-IκB (amino acids 1–54) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (50 cpm/fmol) as described elsewhere (37Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). We have tested the effects of JNK on β-TrCP levels by forced expression of N terminus truncated MEKK1 (ΔMEKK1), which is known as a very potent upstream activator of JNK pathway. As is evident from Fig.1 A, transfection of 293T human embryo kidney cells with the ΔMEKK1 construct led to a robust increase in the steady state levels of β-TrCPmRNA, whereas the expression of the β-TrCPclose relative HOS (17Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was hardly affected. In the overexpression experiments, ΔMEKK1 was reported to activate JNK as well as IKK (38Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and MEK (39Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To investigate which of those pathways contribute to induction of β-TrCP, we expressed the constructs encoding constitutively active IKK (IKKβSE (15Verma I.M. Stevenson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11758-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)), activator of JNK (JNKKCAA(10Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)), activator of p38 (MKK6D/D (10Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)), and activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1S218E,S222L, MEKEL (40Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). We found that transfection of 293T cells with JNKKCAA but not with IKKβSE or MEKEL elevated the steady state levels ofβ-TrCP. A moderate increase inβ-TrCP levels was observed after expression of MKK6D/D (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that activation of JNK (and, to some extent, the p38 kinase pathway) results in the induction of β-TrCP. JNK and p38 belong to a subfamily of stress-activated protein kinases, and their activities are drastically up-regulated in response to a variety of stress stimuli including oxidative and osmotic stress. Thus, we next tested whether cellular stress affects the expression ofβ-TrCP. An oxidative stress caused by treatment of 293T cells with H2O2 resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase in the steady state levels ofβ-TrCP mRNA (Fig.2 A). This increase was observed within 30 min and lasted up to 2 h. Similar extent and kinetics of the up-regulation of β-TrCPmRNA levels were achieved by incubation of cells in the presence of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα; 20 ng/ml). Irradiated 293T cells with UV led to even more robust (up to 8–10-fold) and prolonged (up to 8 h) elevation of the steady state levels of β-TrCP mRNA (Fig.2 B). Comparable results were obtained in the cells treated with sorbitol (0.6 m) to induce a hyperosmotic shock. 2V. Spiegelman and S. Fuchs, unpublished data. Altogether, these data provide the evidence that cellular stress and induction of stress-activated protein kinases up-regulate the levels of β-TrCP mRNA. The induction of two major β-TrCP mRNA species did not seem to be coordinate; the accumulation of a longer transcript was more pronounced in the stressed cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This observation may reflect an alteration of β-TrCP mRNA processing in response to stress, although the exact nature of this phenomenon remains to be elucidated. In order to follow up the stress-inducible changes in the β-TrCP protein expression, we have developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody (see “Materials and Methods”) as a probe for endogenous β-TrCP. This antibody readily recognized recombinant β-TrCP protein, whose expression was driven by cytomegalovirus-based vector in 293T human kidney cells or by baculovirus expression system in insect cells (Fig.3 A). The antibody specifically interacted with β-TrCP but not with another F-box protein Fbx7 (Fig.3 B). Forced expression of ΔMEKK1 in 293T cells resulted in a robust activation of JNK (Fig. 3 C, panel V), modest (if any) activation of IKK (Fig. 3 C, panel IV), and noticeable accumulation of endogenous β-TrCP protein (Fig. 3 C, panel I). All of those effects of ΔMEKK1 were largely inhibited by co-expression of a dominant negative JNKK/SEK construct (SEKAL (41Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar)). The control immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the effects of SEKAL could not be explained by changes in the truncated MEKK1 expression (Fig. 3 C, panel II). Treatment of cells with physiological JNK inducers UV, H2O2, and TNFα also increased the steady state levels of β-TrCP (Fig. 3 D). These data indicate that cellular stress and stress-mediated activation of JNK pathway leads to an increase in the levels of β-TrCP protein. The Wnt pathway was shown to elevate the β-TrCP levels in a manner that is not dependent on β-TrCP gene transcription. To investigate whether β-TrCP transcription is required for induction of β-TrCP by the JNK pathway, we have carried out a run-on assay with nuclei isolated from 293T cells transfected with constitutively active ΔMEKK1 or pCDNA3 plasmids. Expression of ΔMEKK1 led to a robust increase in transcription of c-jun, a well known downstream target of the JNK pathway (2Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar, 3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). We did not detect any corresponding increase in the rate ofβ-TrCP transcription (Fig.4 A). These results suggest that activation of β-TrCP gene promotor is not required for up-regulation of β-TrCP by stress and JNK activation. Treatment of 293T cells (transfected with inactive JNKKAA) with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription allowed us to observe degradation of endogenous β-TrCP mRNA within 2–4 h (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to that, littleβ-TrCP mRNA degradation was seen in the cells expressing constitutively active JNKKCAA (Fig.4 B). These data indicate that activation of JNK may lead to stabilization of β-TrCP mRNA. To further analyze the mechanisms underlying an increase in β-TrCP levels by cellular stress and JNK activation, we utilized the expression of exogenous human cytomegalovirus-driven β-TrCP construct containing an intact 3′-UTR in mouse NIH-3T3 cells. These cells did not express any amounts of endogenous β-TrCP, which were detectable by Northern blot analysis with either human (Fig.5 A) or mouse (data not shown) probe. Treatment of NIH-3T3 cells, which express exogenous β-TrCP, with H2O2 led to accumulation of β-TrCP mRNA (Fig. 5 A). Co-expression of constitutively active JNKKCAA (but not of inactive JNKKAA) also increased the steady state levels of exogenous β-TrCP (Fig.5 B). Before finally concluding on a posttranscriptional mechanism of β-TrCP induction, the effects of stress still needed to be tested in the absence of the cytomegalovirus-driven transcription. To this end, we have inhibited transcription by treating the transfected NIH 3T3 cells with actinomycin D and assessed the rate of degradation of the exogenously expressed β-TrCP mRNA. This mRNA was found rather unstable in the nonstressed cells (with the estimated half-life of ∼40 min). However, incubation of cells in the presence of both actinomycin D and H2O2prevented the degradation of β-TrCP-3′-UTR mRNA (Fig.5 C). Altogether, these findings strongly indicate that the cellular stress-mediated increase in β-TrCP levels is realized through stabilization of β-TrCP mRNA. Elevation of the endogenous levels of β-TrCP may result in an increase in the efficiency of IκB ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (31Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have indeed observed a cooperative effect of constitutively active IKK and JNKK on acceleration of IκB degradation measured by pulse chase in 293T cells.2 It has been previously shown that ΔMEKK1 is capable of activating the NF-κB driven reporters under overexpression conditions (38Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 42Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the possible effect of JNK-mediated accumulation of β-TrCP on NF-κB activities, we chose the conditions under which JNK is activated by expression of its immediately upstream and most specific activator JNKK. In order to exclude any effects on IKK activities, we saturated IκB phosphorylation by forced expression of constitutively active IKKSE. Expression of this construct in 293T cells readily elevated the activity of NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter. Remarkably, co-transfection of JNKKCAA resulted in further increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells. We did not detect any effects of JNKKCAA on the activity of IKKSE measured in an immunokinase assay with recombinant bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase-IκBα as a substrate (data not shown). These data suggest that JNK cooperates with IKK in induction of NF-κB transcriptional activity and that JNK-mediated up-regulation of β-TrCP may serve as a mechanism of this cooperation. Activation of NF-κB by stress and proinflammatory cytokines requires that NF-κB be released from its cytoplasmic retention by IκB. Ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB requires both phosphorylation of IκB by IKK and recognition of phosphorylated IκB by β-TrCP/Fbw1a (27Spencer E. Jiang J. Chen Z.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 29Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 43Suzuki H. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Fujita T. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Shikama H. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2877-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the cellular levels of Fbw1 proteins are critical for IκB ubiquitination. First, β-TrCP basal expression is very low, and β-TrCP protein is hardly detected by a direct immunoblotting analysis (Ref. 31Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and this study). Second, the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB is readily inhibited in living cells by squelching β-TrCP with the phosphopeptides mimicking the phosphorylated IκB (44Yaron A. Gonen H. Alkalay I. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Beyth S. Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6486-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or by expression of F-box-deficient dominant negative β-TrCP mutants (24Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M.

Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Third, an increase in β-TrCP levels by Wnt signaling promotes the transcriptional activation of NF-κB in response to an increase in IκB phosphorylation by constitutively active IKKβ (31Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that cellular stress and activation of JNK pathway results in accumulation of β-TrCP via stabilization ofβ-TrCP mRNA. The elevated levels of β-TrCP together with activation of IKK and subsequent IκB phosphorylation contributes to a rapid IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation in response to stress (Fig.7). Therefore, the findings reported here identify a mechanism underlying the cooperation between stress-induced activation of IKK and JNK pathways in the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. Moreover, activation of JNK by Dsh (32Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) may play a role in the induction of β-TrCP by the Wnt pathway (31Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in addition to β-catenin/Tcf-dependent mechanisms (Fig. 7). Simultaneous activation of JNK and NF-κB by stress and proinflammatory cytokines has been long reported and often attributed to the common components. Although several common signaling effectors (e.g. TRAF2 (45Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 46Shi C.S. Leonardi A. Kyriakis J. Siebenlist U. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3279-3285PubMed Google Scholar), MEKK1 (38Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and CIKS (47Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) are known to signal to both JNK/p38 and IKK activation, little information is available about the cooperation of those signaling pathways. Activation of p38 kinase by salicylates was reported to inhibit IκB degradation and NF-κB activation via suppression of IKK activities (48Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Alpert D. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10925-10929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We observed only a very modest accumulation of β-TrCP mRNA in response to the p38 pathway activation (Fig. 1 B). It has been recently found that DNA binding and transcriptional activation of NF-κB induced by thioredoxin requires activation of JNK and can be inhibited by overexpression of the dominant negative JNKK/JNK constructs (50Das K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4662-4670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These data are in agreement with our findings that JNK activation promotes NF-κB transcriptional activities. Coordinated effects of IKK and JNK activation on IκB phosphorylation and the recognition of phosphorylated IκB by SCFβ-TrCP-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase provide a good explanation for efficient activation of NF-κB by a broad spectrum of cellular stress stimuli. Our findings also suggest that some of the important cellular functions of JNK may be attributed to its regulation of NF-κB transcriptional output. For example, there is a positive correlation between JNK and NF-κB activation in the regulation of apoptosis. In T lymphocytes, activation of both signaling pathways results in induction of apoptosis (51Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2021-2031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some other cell types, both JNK and NF-κB are shown to hold antiapoptotic function. For example, X protein of hepatitis B virus inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis and is associated with up-regulation of both stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (53Diao J. Khine A.A. Sarangi F. Hsu E.

However, the suggested β-TrCP-dependent mechanism of cooperation between JNK and NF-κB pathways may not necessarily exist in all types of cells. Some cells (e.g. NIH-3T3) do not express detectable levels of endogenous β-TrCP (Fig. 5), and, therefore, they are not capable of modulation of NF-κB activity by JNK through induction of β-TrCP. Thus, one should not expect a universal concordance in JNK and NF-κB cellular functions including the regulation of apoptosis. Cellular stress and JNK activation elevate the steady state levels of β-TrCP in a transcription-independent manner. The finding that JNK up-regulates the levels of β-TrCP via stabilization of its mRNA is not entirely surprising. Activation of the JNK pathway has been implicated in the stabilization of many short-lived mRNAs including interleukin-2 (10Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), interleukin-3 (12Ming X.F. Kaiser M. Moroni C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6039-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial growth factor (14Pages G. Berra E. Milanini J. Levy A.P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26484-26491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and others. The effectors of stress, which mediate such stabilization are largely unknown. Stability of many short lived mRNAs, which contain AU-rich elements, is often controlled by HuR, the ubiquitously expressed member of the ELAV protein family (reviewed in Ref. 13Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Analysis of the β-TrCP mRNA sequence revealed three AU-rich elements, two of which are located in the 3′-UTR. Translocation of the nuclear HuR protein to the cytoplasm is suggested to constitute one of the mechanisms of HuR-mediated stabilization of p21CIP/WAF mRNA in response to stress (36Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition to three AU-rich elements, β-TrCP mRNA contains an ACUACUGCCCAGTTTCC sequence in its 3′-UTR. This sequence closely resembles a distal part of the JNK response element, which was found in the 5′-UTR of interleukin-2 mRNA and mediated its stabilization by ΔMEKK1 (11Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YB-1 and nucleolin proteins were shown to bind to the JNK response element (11Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies will determine the role of these and other factors as well as AU-rich and JNK-response elements in the regulation of β-TrCP mRNA stability. Our data do not allow us to exclude the possibility that additional mechanisms of stress-inducible accumulation of β-TrCP protein (e.g. protein stabilization) may exist. The exact modes of β-TrCP induction by JNK are yet to be identified and future studies are required to further delineate the mechanisms of β-TrCP-mediated cooperation between JNK and NF-κB activation.

These different sequences enable interactions to occur with a broad array of protein ligands that modulate a wide range of biological functions in development, differentiation, homeostasis, and bacterial/viral entry (reviewed in Refs. 10Rosenberg R.D.

The specificity of HS-protein interactions is largely dictated by arrangements of sulfate groups and uronic acid epimers along the chain. For example, the pentasaccharide sequence GlcNAc/NS6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S ± 6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S represents the minimum sequence for antithrombin (AT) binding, where the 3S and 6S groups constitute the most critical elements involved in the interaction (17Atha D.H.

However, the NS, 2S, 6S, GlcUA, and IdoUA units are always present in the AT-binding pentasaccharides prepared from both heparin and heparan sulfate (20Loganathan D. Wang H.M. Mallis L.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4362-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

To delineate the biosynthetic pathway that regulates anticoagulantly active heparan sulfate (HSact) biosynthesis, our laboratory has purified and molecularly cloned 3-OST-1 (8Shworak N.W. Liu J.

Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Liu J.

The overall structure of HSact and HSinactdiffers at the disaccharide level (21Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5681-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In general, the AT binding oligosaccharides always have a 2-O-sulfated IdoUA adjacent to the 3-O-sulfated glucosamine unit. To understand how 2-O-sulfation contributes to HSact biosynthesis and AT binding, we used a 2-O-sulfation-defective Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant designated pgsF-17 (24Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This mutant does not express mRNA for 2-OST and therefore synthesizes HS chains without 2-O-sulfated IdoUA or GlcUA residues. Interestingly, this mutant has higher amounts of GlcNS residues compared with parental wild-type cells, suggesting that 2-O-sulfation suppresses the action of the GlcN N-sulfotransferases (24Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We now report that 3-OST-1 can act in the absence of 2-O-sulfation and still generate AT-binding sequences. One of the functions of 2-O-sulfation is apparently to restrict the action of 3-OST-1 at certain sites along the chain. Wild-type CHO cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61; ATCC, Manassas, VA). Wild-type cells and the 2-O-sulfotransferase-deficient mutant pgsF-17 (24Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 µg/ml) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity. The cells were passaged every 3–4 days with 0.125% (w/v) trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, and after 10–15 cycles, fresh cells were revived from stocks stored under liquid nitrogen. Low sulfate medium was composed of Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and fetal bovine serum that had been dialyzed 200-fold against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (25Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). All tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise indicated. The PHOENIX ecotropic retroviral packaging cell line (ATCC no. SD 3444) was a generous gift from Dr. Gary Nolan (Stanford University Medical Center). PHOENIX ecotropic cells were maintained as described (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant pgsF-17 cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 10 µg of pcB7-ECOTROPIC (a generous gift from Dr. Harvey Lodish) using calcium phosphate precipitation (27Perucho M. Hanahan D. Wigler M. Cell. 1980; 22: 309-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The plasmid contains MCAT1, an ecotropic retrovirus receptor, and hygromycin resistance genes from separate constitutive promoters. The transfected cells were selected for resistance to 200 µg/ml hygromycin B (Life technologies, Inc.). Each stable hygromycin-resistant clone was assayed for its ability to be infected by the reporter virus MSCVPLAP, containing alkaline phosphatase (28Fields-Berry S.C. Halliday A.L. Cepko C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The retrovirus plasmid pMSCVpac was a generous gift of Dr. Robert Hawley (University of Toronto) (29Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV3-OST-1 was digested with BglII and XhoI to release the wild-type murine 3-OST-1 cDNA (8Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Logeart D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28008-28019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment (1,623 base pairs) was cloned into theBglII + XhoI sites in pMSCVpac. All plasmid DNA prepared for transfection was made with the Invitrogen SNAP-MIDI kit according to manufacturer directions. Infectious virions were produced by programming ecotropic PHOENIX packaging cells with recombinant provirus plasmids using the calcium phosphate transfection technique as described previously (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). After the precipitation step, the cells were re-fed with 2 ml/well of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated overnight. Viral supernatants were collected, either flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C or used directly after low speed centrifugation. Wild-type and mutant cells containing ecotropic receptors were treated with trypsin and then plated at 150,000 cells/well in a 6-well dish. One day later, target cells (<70% confluent) were incubated overnight with viral supernatants containing 5 µg/ml Polybrene surfactant. After 12 h, the virus containing medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. Wild-type and mutant cells were exposed to recombinant retrovirus three times and selected and maintained in 7.5 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma). More than 90% of mutant cell populations express 3-OST-1 after three rounds of viral exposure. The standard reaction mixture for preparing fluorescent AT contained 20 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 0.3 mmCaCl2, 25 µg of PBS-dialyzed AT (GlycoMed), 4 milliunits neuraminidase (Worthington), 4 milliunits galactose oxidase (Worthington), and 125 µg/ml fluorescein hydrazide (C-356, Molecular Probes) in a final volume of 280 µl. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. PBS (1 ml) and a 50% slurry of heparin-Sepharose in PBS (100 µl) was added and mixed end-over-end for 20 min. After centrifugation, the heparin-Sepharose beads were washed four times with PBS (1 ml). Labeled AT was eluted with four 0.25-ml aliquots of 10× concentrated PBS and desalted by centrifugation for 35 min at 14,000 rpm through two Microcon-10 columns (Millipore). The concentrated AT was diluted with 0.5 ml of 10% FBS in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and used directly for cell labeling studies. Fluorescent FGF-2 was prepared by mixing 50 µl of 1 msodium bicarbonate to 0.5 ml of PBS containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 3 µg of FGF-2. The mixture was then transferred to a vial of reactive dye (Alexa 594, Molecular Probes) and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The isolation of the labeled FGF-2 was identical to that described above for labeled AT. Nearly confluent monolayers of cells were detached by adding 10 ml of 2 mm EDTA in PBS containing 10% FBS and centrifuged. The cell pellets were placed on ice, and 50 µl each of fluorescein-AT and Alexa 594-FGF-2 was added. After 30 min, the cells were washed once and resuspended in 1 ml of 10% FBS in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. Flow cytometry and cell sorting was performed on FACScan and FACStar instruments (Becton Dickinson) using dual color detection filters. Double-positive cells were subsequently single-cell-sorted into a 96-well plate. The single cell clones were expanded and frozen for further analysis. Twelve F17 clones were obtained as described above. The number of copies of 3-OST-1 in the individual clones was determined by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA (10 µg) was digested with 40 units ofEcoRI overnight at 37 °C, electrophoresed on a 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and probed with 3-OST-1 cDNA labeled with the Megaprimer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were hybridized with ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) containing the 3-OST-1 probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml), followed by autoradiography. Cell monolayers were labeled overnight with 100 µCi/ml sodium [35S]sulfate (carrier free, ICN) in sulfate-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), and 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS. Metabolic labeling with [6-3H]glucosamine was done by incubating cells overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm glucose, 10% dialyzed FBS, and 100 µCi/ml d-[6-3H]glucosamine (40 Ci/mmol, ICN). The proteoglycan fraction was isolated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (30Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and beta-eliminated in 0.5 mNaBH4 in 0.4 m NaOH at 4 °C overnight. The samples were neutralized with 5 m acetic acid until bubble formation ceased, and the released chains were purified by another round of DEAE-Sepharose chromatography followed by ethanol precipitation. The pellet from centrifugation was washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in water. The glycosaminoglycans were digested with 20 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Inc.) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 8.0). Complete digestion of chondroitin sulfate by chondroitinase ABC was assured by monitoring the extent of conversion of the carrier to disaccharides (100 µg = 1.14 absorbance units at 232 nm). HS was purified from chondroitinase-degraded products by phenol/chloroform (1:1 (v/v)) extraction and ethanol precipitation. After washing the pellets with 0.5 ml of 75% ethanol, the HS was dissolved in water for further analysis. HS chains were analyzed by gel filtration HPLC (TSK G3000SW, 60 cm × 7.5 mm inner diameter, TosoHass, Inc.). The column was equilibrated in 100 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.2% CHAPS and 0.5 m NaCl and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Blue dextran (Sigma) and [35S]sulfate were used to determine the V o andV t of the column, respectively. Radioactivity in the effluent was determined by in-line liquid scintillation spectrometry (Packard) with a 12-s sampling rate, and the data were averaged over 1-min intervals. The absolute levels of HS were determined by a modified Alcian blue staining assay. A dye stock containing 0.5% Alcian blue, 0.018m H2SO4, and 0.4 mguanidine HCl was centrifuged and filtered (0.2 µm). The working dye solution contained 0.25% Triton X-100 and 0.018m H2SO4; the 5% dye stock was similarly clarified. Ten µl of a solution containing 0.027m H2SO4, 0.375% Triton X-100, and 4 m guanidine HCl was added to samples or standards in water (10 µl) along with 100 µl of working dye solution. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was dissolved in 8 m guanidine HCl. The absorbance at 600 nm was measured, and the HS concentration was determined from a standard curve. The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.075 mg/ml protamine chloride, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, metabolically labeled [3H]HS, [35S]HS, or nonradioactive HS chains, cold PAPS (0.5 mm) or [35S]PAPS (25 µm, 2 × 107 cpm), and 70 ng of purified baculovirus-expressed murine 3-OST-1 in a final volume of 50 µl (31Shukla D.

The mixtures were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and 200 µg of chondroitin sulfate C was added. HS was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and anion exchange chromatography on 0.25-ml columns of DEAE-Sephacel packed in 1-ml syringes (21Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

After ethanol precipitation, the pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, dried under a vacuum, and dissolved in water for further analysis. AT-HS complexes were created by mixing 3-O-sulfated HS in 500 µl of HB buffer (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4)) with 2.5 mm AT, 100 µg of chondroitin sulfate, 0.002% Triton X-100, and 1 mm each of CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2 (32Zhang L.

HB containing ∼50% slurry of Concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (60 µl) was then added. AT complexes were bound to Concanavalin A by way of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides. After 1 h at room temperature, the beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the beads were washed three times with 1.25 ml of HB containing 0.0004% Triton X-100. The supernatant and washing solutions contained HSinact. HSact was eluted with three successive washes with 100 µl of HB containing 1 m NaCl and 0.0004% Triton X-100. After adding 100 µg of chondroitin sulfate as carrier to HSact, the sample was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and ethanol precipitation. The pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, dried briefly under a vacuum, and dissolved in water. Radiolabeled HS samples were mixed with 10 µg of bovine kidney HS (ICN) and depolymerized by hydrazinolysis and nitrous acid degradation (22Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M.

Disaccharides were purified by Bio-Gel P2 chromatography and resolved by ion-pairing reverse-phase HPLC with appropriate disaccharide standards. Bio-Gel P2 columns (0.75 × 200 cm) were equilibrated with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Radiolabeled samples (200 µl) were mixed with dextran blue (5 µg) and phenol red (5 µg) and loaded onto the column. The samples were eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/h, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. The desired fractions were either pooled or dried individually under a vacuum to remove ammonium bicarbonate. HS was digested at 37 °C for 4 h in 100 µl of 40 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 milliunit of heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8, Seikagaku Corp.) and analyzed on a P6 column (0.75 × 200 cm) as described above. For iduronidase digestion, 10% of the total radiolabeled disaccharides collected from Bio-Gel P2 chromatography was dissolved in 400 µl of 1 × incubation buffer (glycosaminoglycan-5006, Oxford GlycoSciences) with 0.5 α-iduronidase (glycosaminoglycan-5006) at 37 °C for 16 h. After adding 400 µl of 333 mm tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate, the digested sample was injected into ion-pairing reverse-phase HPLC. Affinity co-electrophoresis was done as described (33Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). HSact from both wild type and mutants was electrophoresed in an agarose gel through zones containing AT at different concentrations. The migration of HSact was retarded by the presence of AT, with the degree of retardation dependent on AT concentration. A plot of R/[AT] versus R (where R = (M 0 −M)/M 0, M 0 is the migration of [35S]HS in the absence of AT, andM is the observed migration of HS in the presence of AT) was used to determine the apparent K d values (33Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin (4 mg/ml 50% glycerol, 3,000 units/mg) and factor Xa (10.4 mg/ml 50% glycerol, 820 units/mg) were from Hematologic Technologies. Factor Xa and α-thrombin were diluted 1:200 with PBS containing 1 mg of bovine serum albumin (4 units/ml and 15 units/ml, respectively). AT (2.5 mg/ml) was diluted 1:200 to give a 2 × 10−7m stock solution. The chromogenic substrates, S-2765 (factor Xa assays) and S-2238 (thrombin assays), were from Chromogenix. Both substrates were made up at 1 mmwith 1 mg/ml Polybrene in water. Heparin (174 international units/mg, Sigma) was used as a standard. HSact was used for factor Xa (≤25 ng) and thrombin assays (≤62.5 ng). The protocol involved adding 25 µl of AT (2 × 10−7m) to 25 µl of a serial dilution of heparin standards or HSact from wild-type or mutant cells in Tris-EDTA (50 mm Tris, 7.5 mm EDTA, and 175 mm NaCl (pH 8.4)) buffer in a 96-well plate. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 75 s. Factor Xa (25 µl, 4 units/ml) or thrombin (25 µl, 6 units/ml check concentration) was added. After incubating at 37 °C for 195 s, 25 µl of S-2765 or S-2238 was added. The absorbance at 405 nm was read every minute for 10 min in a SpectroMAX Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc.). The inhibition rate constant (k 2) for AT inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa were derived from the equation 1/[E]t − 1/[E]o =k 2 t, where [E]o and [E]t are the concentrations of active enzyme at the initial and measured times of the reaction, respectively. The concentration of Xa was calculated based on the activity measured in the absence of inhibitor (34Fersht A. Enzyme Structures and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar). CHO wild-type and pgsF-17 cells do not express 3-OST-1 and therefore do not make detectable 3-O-sulfate containing saccharides or bind to AT. The lack of uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase activity in the mutant also prevents binding to FGF-2 (24Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To study the effect of 3-OST-1 on ligand binding, mutant and wild-type cells were stably transduced with multiple copies of 3-OST-1 cDNA. As shown by flow cytometry, the expression of 3-OST-1 gave rise to wild-type and mutant cells that bound AT, but the binding of FGF-2 was unchanged (Fig.1). The wild-type transductant contained three copies of 3-OST-1 (B, broken line), whereas the population of transduced mutant cells (D, broken line) contained one or more copies of the gene based on the observation that 90% of the cells exhibited binding to AT (D, broken line). The mutant cells that exhibited high AT binding were single-cell-sorted into a 96-well plate, and 12 clones were expanded for further analysis. Genomic DNA from the clones was digested with EcoRI and probed for 3-OST-1 by Southern blot (Fig.2). All the clones, including wild-type cells and the original mutant, have an endogenous copy of 3-OST-1. No enzyme activity was found in nontransduced wild-type and mutant cells, indicating that the endogenous gene was inactive. The 12 clones have 1–5 inserted copies of the gene. 3-OST-1 activity roughly correlated with the number of extra copies of the gene (coefficient of correlation = 0.948; data not shown). We have shown previously that 3-OST-1 generally acts on glucosamine units located to the reducing side of GlcUA to generate products containing GlcUA-GlcNS3S and GlcUA-GlcNS3S6S (8Shworak N.W. Liu J.

To determine whether removing uronyl 2-O-sulfation affects the specificity of the 3-OST-1, metabolically labeled [35S]HS from the mutant was 3-O-sulfated in vitro with purified 3-OST-1 and cold PAPS. [35H]HS chains were purified and depolymerized completely by hydrazinolysis and nitrous acid, and the resultant disaccharides were analyzed by IPRP-HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). The predominant sulfated disaccharides in the mutant cells (Fig. 3, solid line) consist of GlcUA-aManR6S (peak 2) and IdoUA-aManR6S (peak 3). In vitrotreatment of mutant HS with pure 3-OST-1 and cold PAPS yielded two new disulfated disaccharides (Fig. 3, dotted line). The first unknown disaccharide (peak 4) has the same retention time as an IdoUA-[3-O-35S]aManR6S standard on IPRP-HPLC (36Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The second disaccharide (peak 5) has the same retention time as a GlcUA-[3-O-35S]aManR6S standard. This result suggests that the addition of 3-O-sulfate to an IdoUA-[6-O-35S]GlcNS residue occurs in the mutant HS chain in vitro. To test whether the addition of 3-O-sulfate to an IdoUA-[6-O-35S]GlcNS residue occurs in vivo and whether the addition of 3-O-sulfate occurs in an IdoUA-GlcNS residue that can not be observed by using a metabolically labeled [35S]HS chain, [6-3H]GlcN-labeled HS preparations from transduced F17 clones 2, 3, 10, and 12 (containing one, three, five, and four copies of 3-OST-1, respectively) were analyzed and compared with the transduced wild-type and parental lines. [3H]HS chains were purified and depolymerized completely by hydrazinolysis and nitrous acid, and the resultant disaccharides were analyzed by IPRP-HPLC (see ”Experimental Procedures“). As shown previously, the predominant monosulfated disaccharides in CHO cells consist of GlcUA-aManR6S (peak 4) and IdoUA-aManR6S (peak 5), and the major disulfated species consists of IdoUA2S-aManR6S (peak 7) (35Bame K.J.

DNA polymerase δ (pol δ)1 is one of the at least 12 DNA polymerases identified thus far in mammalian cells (1Woodgate R.

Studies of in vitro reconstituted SV40 DNA replication established the requirement of two DNA polymerases, pol δ and pol α. pol δ is capable of highly processive DNA synthesis in association with the molecular sliding clamp, PCNA, and thus plays a role in the synthesis of the leading strand at the replication fork. pol α/primase functions to synthesize RNA-DNA primers for initiation on the leading strand, but it is thought that pol δ is required for the completion of Okazaki fragment synthesis (3Waga S.

Several lines of evidences have shown that pol δ may also be involved in nucleotide excision repair (5Zeng X.R. Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Hao H. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

The catalytic subunit is a 125-kDa protein that is encoded by thePOLD1 gene in human cells (12Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Zhu L. Toomey N.L. Lee M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The transcriptional level of pol δ mRNA is regulated during the cell cycle (13Zeng X.R. Hao H. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24027-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is induced in serum-stimulated cells (14Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Zhang P. Zeng R.X. Lee M.Y. Chromosoma. 1992; 102: S121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The POLD1 gene promoter is TATA-less, GC-rich, and has been reported to be activated by Sp1 and Sp3 transcriptional factors that bind specifically to two repeat sequences in the promoter (15Zhao L. Chang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4869-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the effects of other transcriptional factors on POLD1 promoter remain unknown.The p53 tumor suppressor gene product functions as a checkpoint in maintaining genome stability. More than half of a wide spectrum of human cancers contain mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, and more than 90% of the p53 missense mutations are clustered within the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain, suggesting that functional inactivation of p53, especially the DNA binding activity of p53, is a crucial and often obligatory step in pathways to tumorigenesis. p53 protein is induced and/or activated in response to a variety of stimuli such as DNA damage or the expression of viral oncogenes. Activation of p53 leads to one of the two major cellular pathways, either apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, that prevents cells from progressing to S phase until the damaged DNA is fully repaired (16Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The transcriptional functions of p53 are well established to be important in arresting the cell cycle, although this is less clear in p53-mediated apoptosis.As a transcription activator, p53 recognizes a specific consensus DNA sequence consisting of two copies of a 10-bp motif, 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3′, separated by a 0–13-bp spacer. Wild-type p53 transactivates the expression of its target genes by specifically binding to p53-binding sites in the sequences of these genes (17Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Among the p53-transactivated genes isp21/WAF1/Cip1, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (18El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). It is evident that the p53-induced transcription of p21/WAF1/Cip1 is responsible in large measure for p53-dependent G1 arrest (19Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar,20Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Moreover, p21/WAF1/Cip1 has been shown to directly inhibit DNA replication by binding tightly to and masking the elements on PCNA that are required for its interaction with DNA polymerase δ (21Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The product of another p53-transactivated gene, Gadd45, has been shown to interact with PCNA and inhibit DNA excision repair (22Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Other evidence has also suggested that p53 may play one or more roles in regulating processes such as DNA replication, repair, and recombination (16Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). p53 not only acts as a transcriptional activator but also has been shown to repress the activity of a broad range of viral and cellular gene promoters that lack p53 binding sites, including but not limited to those of the α-fetoprotein gene (ARF), bcl-2, cdc2, c-fos, cyclooxygenase-2 gene (Cox-2), DNA topoisomerase IIα gene, insulin-like growth factor I receptor gene (IGF-IR), microtubule-associated protein gene (Map4), retinoblastoma gene (Rb), and Werner helicase gene (WRN) (16Ko L.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6191-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Because of its critical role in DNA synthesis, we investigated whether the DNA polymerase δ catalytic subunit gene, POLD1, is one of the transcriptional targets of the p53 tumor suppressor. The study described here demonstrates that the expression of the POLD1gene mRNA is repressed by wild-type p53 in response to DNA damage. This p53-mediated repression is at the transcriptional level and is mediated largely through a specific interaction between p53 and a p53-binding site in the POLD1 promoter. Evidence was also obtained for a mechanism in which p53 exerts its repressive effect by exclusion of the binding of Sp1 transcriptional factor to a Sp1-binding site harbored within the p53 binding site.DISCUSSIONp53 is a powerful tumor suppressor that acts as a checkpoint in maintaining genomic stability by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis after DNA damage, largely through its function as a transcriptional regulator. Following enhanced expression and activation of p53 as a transcription factor, it also participates in a process by which DNA replication pauses, presumably until DNA repair is complete. Only a few p53 target genes have been identified as involved in the inhibition of DNA replication. Among these arep21/Cip1/WAF1 (18El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar) andGadd45 (22Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as evidenced by the example ofp21/Cip1/WAF1, regulation of a single p53 transcriptional target gene is generally not sufficient to account for the biological functions of p53 (19Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 20Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). In this regard, the identification of p53 target genes that participate in the regulation of DNA replication is an important objective, because the control of DNA synthesis is clearly one of the key cellular processes that is impacted by p53. In this study, the POLD1 gene was identified as a novel target of p53 transcriptional regulation, and evidence was obtained for a competition by p53 with Sp1 at a novel p53 binding sequence (P4), which harbors an internal Sp1 site.Care was taken in this study to use a tet-off cell system in which ectopic wt-p53 expression was induced to a level similar to that observed in MMS-treated MCF7 cells. The H24-p53-14 cell line used in this study is one of the tet-off cell lines that has been utilized to investigate the role of p53 in G1 cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Transcripts of genes such asp21/Waf1/Cip1, mdm2,Gadd45, and bax were also shown to be activated in these cell lines (29Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In this study, POLD1 mRNA was found to be repressed in response to both MMS- and tetracycline-induced p53 expression, suggesting that POLD1 repression by p53 is physiologically relevant.The results from this study provide evidence for a mechanism involving competition between p53 and Sp1 for binding to the P4 site of thePOLD1 promoter, which contains both a p53 and a Sp1 site. This type of exclusion mechanism for p53 transcriptional repression may be more general, as evidence has been found for competition between p53 and other transcriptional factors in other systems. The repression of α-fetoprotein expression by p53 was found to involve competition between binding of p53 and hepatic nuclear factor-3 for overlapping sites in the α-fetoprotein promoter (23Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), a situation similar to that observed for the POLD1 promoter. Studies of the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-2 gene by p53 have revealed that p53 competes with TATA-binding protein in a 40-bp region in the promoter close to the transcription start site; however, the specific sequence elements involved have not been identified (24Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Chung W.J. Mestre J.R. Sampat A. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10911-10915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In vitro competition between p53 and Sp1 for binding to overlapping DNA sequences has been reported for the SV40 and HIV-LTR (human immunodeficiency virus) viral promoters (38Perrem K. Rayner J. Voss T. Sturzbecher H. Jackson P. Braithwaite A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1299-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 935-949PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for multiple Sp1 binding sites within the p53-responsive region for the transcriptional inhibitory effect of wild-type p53 has recently been shown on cellular promoters for vascular endothelial growth factor gene (VEGF) (40Zhang L., Yu, D.

Therefore, the findings that p53 is able to exclude the binding of Sp1 by overlapping binding sites and exert a repressive effect onPOLD1 gene transcription provides an important example of Sp1-p53 exclusion on a cellular gene promoter, considering a wealth of recent evidence that p53 is able to inhibit Sp1-mediated promoter activity of many genes such as insulin-like growth factor-I receptor gene (26Ohlsson C. Kley N. Werner H. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Werner helicase gene (27Yamabe Y. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Yokota J. Sugawara M. Furuichi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6191-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the multiple drug resistance-associated protein gene (42Wang Q. Beck W.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5762-5769PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1-binding sites are present in the promoters of many growth-regulated genes (43Azizkhan J. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). It may be important to consider that such inhibitory effects of p53 on Sp1-mediated promoter activity could be extended to the regulation of other cellular promoters that contain overlapping p53- and Sp1-binding sites. There is also evidence that there are structural similarities in the binding motifs for Sp1 and p53 (44MacLeod M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), providing a structural rationale for the existence of overlapping Sp1-p53 binding sites.Biochemical evidence for physical interactions between p53 and Sp1 has been lacking. Attempts to detect a stable Sp1-p53 heterocomplex using cell extracts from MMS-treated MCF7 cells in the presence or absence of P4 oligonucleotide were negative, although positive signals were obtained from experiments with extracts in which p53 was expressed ectopically (data not shown). In addition, we were unable to detect a Sp1-p53-DNA complex in our EMSA experiment (Fig. 9). The negative results for Sp1-p53 heterocomplex formation are consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation and EMSA results obtained by Bargonetti et al. (39Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 935-949PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in some studies, Sp1 has been found to form a heterocomplex with mutant or proliferative forms of p53 in regulating promoter activities (45Gualberto A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 46Borellini F. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we cannot exclude the operation of a second level of transrepression involving p53 interaction with other transcription factors, as the co-transfection experiments involving Sp1 and p53 indicated that a competition at the P4 site would account for only about half of the observed p53 effects on Sp1-driven promoter activity.p53 has been shown to transrepress several other DNA replication-related genes. In a “DEX-on” cell line, dexamethasone-induced wild-type p53 protein expression led to cell growth inhibition and a significant decrease in steady-state mRNA level of DNA polymerase α catalytic subunit gene. The mechanism of such inhibition has not been investigated (47Lin D. Shields M.T. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9210-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 also confers cell line-dependent repression of the promoter ofPCNA gene, the product of which is well established to be involved in DNA replication/repair and cell cycle regulation (48Jackson P. Ridgway P. Rayner J. Noble J. Braithwaite A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 49Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsuoka S. Takahashi T. Matsukage A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Wild-type but not mutant p53 induced by DNA damaging agents was able to cause a decrease in DNA topoisomerase IIα mRNA and promoter activity. However, such transrepression is not by p53 sequence-specific binding (25Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Sandri M.I. Isaacs R.J. Ongkeko W.M. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Broggini M. Sikhanskaya F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4464-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent studies of genes regulated by p53 have revealed additional DNA replication genes that are repressed by p53, including DNA primase polypeptide I, chromosomal protein HMG-17, and RFC 37, which encodes one of the small subunits of replication factor C (RFC) that loads and unloads PCNA clamps (51Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 52Kannan K. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Givol D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 53Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).The exact biological functions/consequences of the transrepression of DNA replication-related genes are still unclear. These genes are generally expressed in late G1/S-phase when cells have already passed the cell cycle restriction point and are committed to enter S phase and initiate DNA synthesis. It is conceivable that p53-mediated POLD1 repression serves to halt DNA replication as the consequence of p53-induced cell cycle arrest, which involves immediate-early genes such as c-jun, c-fos, c-myc, and other cell cycle regulation genes such asp21/WAF1/Cip1,Cyclin/Cdk, and Rb. It is also possible that the transcriptional repression of POLD1 and other DNA replication genes may be the result of p53-induced prolonged, probably permanent, G1 delay based on the fact that the expression of DNA polymerase α (54Moore A.L. Wang T.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 485-494PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA polymerase δ 2B. Li and M. Y. W. Lee, unpublished data. are significantly inhibited during myeloid and erythroleukemia cell terminal differentiation. Growing lines of evidence have argued that loss of p53 results in decreased genomic stability, not because of loss of transient checkpoint controls but because of a failure to prevent severely damaged cells from surviving and propagating, underscoring the important role of prolonged G1 arrest in maintaining DNA integrity (55Carr A.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1765-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed for insightful understanding of the biological effects of the p53 transrepression of DNA polymerase δ catalytic subunit gene. However, it is possible that loss of wild-type p53 function in cancer cells might rescue thePOLD1 promoter activity normally repressed by wild-type p53, contributing to unregulated cancer cell growth and proliferation.It seems paradoxical that after the genome is harmed by DNA-damaging agents, p53, the “genome guardian,” represses the transcription ofPOLD1 gene, the product of which is also suggested to be involved in DNA repair. A possible scenario is that p53 arrests cell cycle, halts DNA replication, and leads to the repression of POLD1 transcription. Simultaneously, p53 stimulates initiation of DNA repair, which involves DNA polymerase ε and DNA polymerase β. There are some reports that provide support for this possibility. 1) pol ε functions as a sensor for DNA replication coordinating the transcriptional and cell cycle response to replication block (56Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). 2) pol ε or pol δ components perform equally well in reconstituted nucleotide-excision repair assays (6Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). 3) In yeast genetic studies, pol ε and pol δ are able to efficiently substitute for each other in nucleotide excision repair after uv damage (57Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2173-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). (4Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Transcription of pol β, the major DNA polymerase in base-excision repair, is not repressed by overexpressed p53 (49Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsuoka S. Takahashi T. Matsukage A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In summary, the present studies show that POLD1 gene expression is repressed by wild-type p53. The evidence indicates that the majority of transcriptional repression was mediated by sequence-specific binding of p53 to the P4 p53-binding site in thePOLD1 promoter. Examination of the mechanism by which p53 represses the POLD1 promoter led to the identification of a competition between p53 and Sp1 for overlapping binding sites in the P4 sequence of the POLD1 promoter. Thus, the present finding that POLD1 is subject to p53 transrepression adds the DNA polymerase δ catalytic subunit gene, a central enzyme of DNA replication, to the growing group of DNA replication/repair genes inhibited by p53. These findings also add to the currently emerging body of evidence that sequence-specific binding of p53 to promoter sequences can result in transcriptional repression in addition to the known effects of p53 as a transcriptional activator. However, the biological functions/consequences of the transrepression ofPOLD1 by p53 in response to DNA damage is more complicated and remain to be determined. Future investigation of POLD1 transcriptional regulation by other cis-elements andtrans-factors and the interaction between p53 andtrans-factors may be helpful in understanding the biological significance of POLD1 gene regulation by p53 in response to DNA damage in cellular processes such as DNA replication/repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. DNA replication is a highly organized process that involves many enzymes and proteins, including several DNA polymerases. DNA polymerase δ (pol δ)1 is one of the at least 12 DNA polymerases identified thus far in mammalian cells (1Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,2Dominguez O. Ruiz J.F. De Lera T.L. Garcia-Diaz M. Gonzalez M.A. Kirchhoff T. Martinez-A C. Bernad A. Blanco L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of in vitro reconstituted SV40 DNA replication established the requirement of two DNA polymerases, pol δ and pol α. pol δ is capable of highly processive DNA synthesis in association with the molecular sliding clamp, PCNA, and thus plays a role in the synthesis of the leading strand at the replication fork. pol α/primase functions to synthesize RNA-DNA primers for initiation on the leading strand, but it is thought that pol δ is required for the completion of Okazaki fragment synthesis (3Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 4Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidences have shown that pol δ may also be involved in nucleotide excision repair (5Zeng X.R. Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Hao H. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 96: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The pol δ enzyme is now thought to consist of at least four subunits in human and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (10Liu L. Mo J. Rodriguez-Belmonte E.M. Lee M.Y. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1986630778,"The Bacillus subtilis CwlC and theBacillus polymyxa var. colistinus CwlV are the cell wall lytic N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases in the CwlB (LytC) family. Deletion in the CwlC amidase from the C terminus to residue 177 did not change the amidase activity. However, when the deletion was extended slightly toward the N terminus, the amidase activity was entirely lost. Further, the N-terminal deletion mutant without the first 19 amino acids did not have the amidase activity. These results indicate that the N-terminal half (residues 1–176) of the CwlC amidase, the region homologous to the truncated CwlV (CwlVt), is a catalytic domain. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on 20 highly conserved amino acid residues within the catalytic domain of CwlC. The amidase activity was lost completely on single amino acid substitutions at two residues (Glu-24 and Glu-141). Similarly, the substitution of the two glutamic acid residues (E26Q and E142Q) of the truncated CwlV (CwlV1), which corresponded to Glu-24 and Glu-141 of CwlC, was critical to the amidase activity. The EDTA-treated CwlV1 did not have amidase activity. The amidase activity of the EDTA-treated CwlV1 was restored by the addition of Zn2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ but not by the addition of Mg2+ and Ca2+.

Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymer consisting of glycan strands cross-linked by peptides. In the spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis, there may be 30 or more peptidoglycan hydrolases (1Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan hydrolases are involved in important biological processes such as cell wall turnover (2Holtje J.-V.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6230-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amidases specifically cleave the amido bond between the lactyl group of muramic acid and the α-amino group of l-alanine, which is the first amino acid of the stem peptide (11Harz H. Burgdorf K. Holtje J.-V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 120-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis CwlC amidase gene, whose product has an overall amino acid identity of 73% with the CwlM amidase from Bacillus licheniformis (12Kuroda A. Sugimoto Y. Funahashi T. Sekiguchi J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was cloned (13Kuroda A. Asami Y. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6260-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The CwlC amidase is a polypeptide of 255 amino acids with a molecular mass of 27 kDa. The CwlC amidase is secreted from sporulating cells (7Smith T.J. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the CwlC amidase hydrolyzed both B. subtilis vegetative cell wall and spore peptidoglycan in vitro, a cwlC-deficient mutant did not cause significant changes in sporulation, resistance of spores against heat and lysozyme, and germination. Recently, it was found that mother cells of a strain insertionally inactivated incwlC and major amidase gene cwlB(lytC) (14Kuroda A. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7304-7312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are expressed at sporulation and vegetative phases, respectively, were not lysed at the end of sporulation (7Smith T.J. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the cwlV amidase gene fromBacillus polymyxa var. colistinus was recently cloned and sequenced in our laboratory (15Ishikawa S. Kawahara S. Sekiguchi J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The cwlV gene encodes a polypeptide of 499 amino acid residues, and the mature CwlV (CwlVt, Fig. 1) purified from the supernatant of the culture was a C-terminal protein (183 amino acids, 20.1 kDa) with cell wall lytic activity.The catalytic mechanism of the bacterial cell wall lytic amidases such as CwlB, CwlC, and CwlV is not well understood. In a previous study, we concluded that the CwlC amidase does not have catalytic action similar to that of serine protease as judged from the resistivity of the CwlC amidase to the serine protease inhibitor (16Shida T. Hattori H. Ise F. Sekiguchi J. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1522-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to obtain new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cell wall lysis by the amidases. For this purpose, we designed a series of mutants of CwlC and CwlV amidases. First, we constructed mutants with deletions from the N-terminal or the C-terminal sides of the CwlC amidase to determine the catalytic domain. Second, to determine the catalytic amino acid residues, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on 20 amino acid residues within the N-terminal 175 amino acids (catalytic domain) of the CwlC amidase and on two amino acid residues of the truncated CwlV amidase (CwlV1). Furthermore, the influence of divalent metal cations on the activity of the CwlV1 amidase was investigated.DISCUSSIONA wide variety of lytic enzymes of bacterial cell wall have been isolated from bacteria and bacteriophages as well as the animal and plant kingdoms. Lysozymes (endo-N-acetylmuramidase) have long served as model systems for the study of protein structure and function (27Blake C.C.F. Nature. 1965; 206: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 28Kelly J.A. Sielecki A.R. Sykes B.D. James M.N.G. Phillips D.C. Nature. 1979; 282: 875-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Hen egg white lysozyme is one of the enzymes in which the catalytic mechanism has been extensively investigated (29Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 30Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed.

In contrast, although theN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, which lyse the cell wall of bacteria and are widely found in living organisms, play important roles in cell cycles, their enzymatic characterizations have been little studied. To consider reaction mechanism of the amidases in the CwlB family, we performed mutational analyses at first with respect to the CwlC and the truncated CwlV (CwlV1) amidases to elucidate their catalytic residues. Next we examined the influence of divalent metal cations on amidase activity.Catalytic Amino Acid Residues of the Cell Wall Lytic N-Acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine AmidasesThe results of the mutagenesis in the catalytic domains of the CwlC and CwlV1 amidases indicated that Glu-24 and Glu-141 in the CwlC amidase and Glu-26 and Glu-142 in the CwlV1 amidase are catalytically essential. These two glutamic acids are strictly conserved throughN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases and the proteins with the homologous amino acid sequence listed in Fig.9. The mutant E141Q of the CwlC amidase and the mutant E142Q of the CwlV1 amidase were overproduced in E. coli and purified. The changes from glutamic acid to glutamine were isosteric. The CD spectra of these mutants were identical with those of the wild-type amidases. This suggests that the loss of the amidase activities of these mutants is not attributable to destruction of the structure of the amidases. Similar purification of the mutant amidases (E24Q of CwlC and E26Q of CwlV1) was attempted, but both mutants formed inclusion bodies in E. coli. Because the E24A mutant of CwlC did not form inclusion bodies, it was overproduced inE. coli and purified. The CD spectrum of the E24A mutant (Fig. 5 A) showed that it was almost identical with the wild-type in structure. Furthermore, to reconfirm the indispensability of the two glutamic acids, CwlC mutants, in which aspartic acid was substituted for Glu-24 and/or Glu-141, were constructed and their amidase activities were examined. The E24D and E141D mutations reduced appreciably the amidase activities, compared with the wild-type CwlC. The double-substituted E24/141D mutant lost all amidase activity. The decrease in both side-chain lengths with the change of the glutamic acid residues to aspartic acid residues is attributable to the shortening of the distance between the glutamic acid residues at the catalytic site. From these results, we propose that Glu-24 and Glu-141 of CwlC and Glu-26 and Glu-142 of CwlV1 are the most likely candidates for the essential catalytic residues.Figure 9Alignment of regions containing the proposed catalytic glutamic acid residues of the homologous amidases.

On the other hand, Mg2+ and Ca2+ are not entirely essential cofactors of the amidase. Comparisons of amidase activities in mixtures of Zn2+ and either Mg2+ or Ca2+suggested that Zn2+ bound to the amidase with higher affinity than Mg2+ and Ca2+ (data not shown). We also observed a peak for the optimal concentration of Zn2+ at ∼0.2 mm and that of Co2+at ∼1.0 mm. But higher concentrations of these cations were inhibitory (data not shown). The reason for the decreased activity at higher concentrations is not clear. However, the most striking result from these experiments was the observation that the heavy metal cations Zn2+, Mn2+, and Co2+supported the cell wall lytic activity of the CwlV amidase, whereas Mg2+ and Ca2+, the presumed physiologically relevant cations, did not. This observation prompted us to examine whether Zn2+ or any of the other catalytic metal cations could serve as cofactors for cleavage of the amide bond of the peptidoglycan.Catalytic Mechanism of the N-Acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine AmidaseT7 lysozyme (amidase) cuts the amido bond between the lactyl group of the muramic acid residue and the α-amino group of thel-alanine residue in the peptidoglycan similar to B. subtilis CwlC amidase or B. polymyxa var.colistinus CwlV amidase. But T7 lysozyme is very different from the CwlC amidase family in amino acid sequence. With respect to the catalytic residues of T7 lysozyme, no acidic amino acid residue is found inside of the cleft, in which Zn2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ is chelated as a cofactor (32Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Consequently, we can say that the reaction mechanisms of the CwlC and CwlV amidases differ from that of T7 lysozyme, because the critical catalytic residues of the bacterial amidases are two glutamic acids.Comparison of the structures of matrilysin, thermolysin, and carboxypeptidase A, which are zinc metalloendopeptidases, reveals both similarities and differences in their active sites (33Auld D.S. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 89: 29-50Crossref Google Scholar). The metalloenzymes have a common catalytic zinc site in which the zinc atom is coordinated by three protein ligands and a Glu residue is considered to act as a nucleophile or general base (34Mackenzie L.F. Brookes G.S. Cutfield J.F. Sullivan P.A. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Vazeux G. Wang J. Corvol P. Llores-Cortes C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9069-9074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the type of the ligand and the scaffolding of the zinc site are not the same. Thus three His residues in the catalytic site chelate the zinc ion of matrilysin directly, whereas two His residues and one Glu residue chelate the zinc ion of thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A directly. In the amidases listed in Fig. 9, His-10 and His-79 of CwlC are conserved residues that correspond to His-10 and His-80 of CwlV1. The amidase activities of the H10Q and H79N mutants of the CwlC amidase were reduced to 23% and 15%, respectively (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, the H79L mutant did not show detectable activity. The E142Q of CwlV1 contained one cobalt ion per protein molecule (Table I) suggesting Glu-26 not Glu-142 of CwlV1 is essential for binding of the divalent metal cation. Consequently, it would be possible to argue that one of the critical Glu residues (Glu24-CwlC, Glu26-CwlV1) and the two conserved His residues act as ligands of the zinc ion. Furthermore, the carbonyl oxygen of the amide bond of the peptidoglycan might coordinate with the zinc ion, and then the resulting polarization of the carbonyl bond might accelerate the cleavage reaction of the amide bond of the peptidoglycan. The remaining Glu residue (Glu-141-CwlC, Glu-142-CwlV1) might act as a nucleophile or a general base catalyst in the subsequent reaction step.In this study, it has become apparent that the two conserved glutamic acids of the cell wall lytic amidases are the main catalytic amino acid residues and divalent metal cations such as Zn2+ act as a cofactor for the activity of the amidases. To elucidate the reaction mechanism and the peptidoglycan recognition mechanism of the amidases, further studies, including crystallization experiments and/or deliberated site-directed mutagenesis, are necessary. The cell wall of Bacillus subtilis is ∼25–30 nm thick and contains roughly 50% by weight peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymer consisting of glycan strands cross-linked by peptides. In the spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis, there may be 30 or more peptidoglycan hydrolases (1Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan hydrolases are involved in important biological processes such as cell wall turnover (2Holtje J.-V.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) during vegetative growth, sporulation, and germination. N-Acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases are classified into one of the cell wall hydrolase groups (1Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 10Nugroho F.A. Yamamoto H. Kobayashi Y. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6230-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amidases specifically cleave the amido bond between the lactyl group of muramic acid and the α-amino group of l-alanine, which is the first amino acid of the stem peptide (11Harz H. Burgdorf K. Holtje J.-V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 120-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis CwlC amidase gene, whose product has an overall amino acid identity of 73% with the CwlM amidase from Bacillus licheniformis (12Kuroda A. Sugimoto Y. Funahashi T. Sekiguchi J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was cloned (13Kuroda A. Asami Y. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6260-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The CwlC amidase is a polypeptide of 255 amino acids with a molecular mass of 27 kDa. The CwlC amidase is secreted from sporulating cells (7Smith T.J. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the CwlC amidase hydrolyzed both B. subtilis vegetative cell wall and spore peptidoglycan in vitro, a cwlC-deficient mutant did not cause significant changes in sporulation, resistance of spores against heat and lysozyme, and germination. Recently, it was found that mother cells of a strain insertionally inactivated incwlC and major amidase gene cwlB(lytC) (14Kuroda A. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7304-7312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are expressed at sporulation and vegetative phases, respectively, were not lysed at the end of sporulation (7Smith T.J. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the cwlV amidase gene fromBacillus polymyxa var. colistinus was recently cloned and sequenced in our laboratory (15Ishikawa S. Kawahara S. Sekiguchi J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The cwlV gene encodes a polypeptide of 499 amino acid residues, and the mature CwlV (CwlVt, Fig. 1) purified from the supernatant of the culture was a C-terminal protein (183 amino acids, 20.1 kDa) with cell wall lytic activity. The catalytic mechanism of the bacterial cell wall lytic amidases such as CwlB, CwlC, and CwlV is not well understood. In a previous study, we concluded that the CwlC amidase does not have catalytic action similar to that of serine protease as judged from the resistivity of the CwlC amidase to the serine protease inhibitor (16Shida T. Hattori H. Ise F. Sekiguchi J. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1522-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to obtain new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cell wall lysis by the amidases. For this purpose, we designed a series of mutants of CwlC and CwlV amidases. First, we constructed mutants with deletions from the N-terminal or the C-terminal sides of the CwlC amidase to determine the catalytic domain. Second, to determine the catalytic amino acid residues, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on 20 amino acid residues within the N-terminal 175 amino acids (catalytic domain) of the CwlC amidase and on two amino acid residues of the truncated CwlV amidase (CwlV1). Furthermore, the influence of divalent metal cations on the activity of the CwlV1 amidase was investigated. DISCUSSIONA wide variety of lytic enzymes of bacterial cell wall have been isolated from bacteria and bacteriophages as well as the animal and plant kingdoms. Lysozymes (endo-N-acetylmuramidase) have long served as model systems for the study of protein structure and function (27Blake C.C.F. Nature. 1965; 206: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 28Kelly J.A. Sielecki A.R. Sykes B.D. James M.N.G. Phillips D.C. Nature. 1979; 282: 875-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Hen egg white lysozyme is one of the enzymes in which the catalytic mechanism has been extensively investigated (29Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 30Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed.

In contrast, although theN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, which lyse the cell wall of bacteria and are widely found in living organisms, play important roles in cell cycles, their enzymatic characterizations have been little studied. To consider reaction mechanism of the amidases in the CwlB family, we performed mutational analyses at first with respect to the CwlC and the truncated CwlV (CwlV1) amidases to elucidate their catalytic residues. Next we examined the influence of divalent metal cations on amidase activity.Catalytic Amino Acid Residues of the Cell Wall Lytic N-Acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine AmidasesThe results of the mutagenesis in the catalytic domains of the CwlC and CwlV1 amidases indicated that Glu-24 and Glu-141 in the CwlC amidase and Glu-26 and Glu-142 in the CwlV1 amidase are catalytically essential. These two glutamic acids are strictly conserved throughN-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases and the proteins with the homologous amino acid sequence listed in Fig.9. The mutant E141Q of the CwlC amidase and the mutant E142Q of the CwlV1 amidase were overproduced in E. coli and purified. The changes from glutamic acid to glutamine were isosteric. The CD spectra of these mutants were identical with those of the wild-type amidases. This suggests that the loss of the amidase activities of these mutants is not attributable to destruction of the structure of the amidases. Similar purification of the mutant amidases (E24Q of CwlC and E26Q of CwlV1) was attempted, but both mutants formed inclusion bodies in E. coli. Because the E24A mutant of CwlC did not form inclusion bodies, it was overproduced inE. coli and purified. The CD spectrum of the E24A mutant (Fig. 5 A) showed that it was almost identical with the wild-type in structure. Furthermore, to reconfirm the indispensability of the two glutamic acids, CwlC mutants, in which aspartic acid was substituted for Glu-24 and/or Glu-141, were constructed and their amidase activities were examined. The E24D and E141D mutations reduced appreciably the amidase activities, compared with the wild-type CwlC. The double-substituted E24/141D mutant lost all amidase activity. The decrease in both side-chain lengths with the change of the glutamic acid residues to aspartic acid residues is attributable to the shortening of the distance between the glutamic acid residues at the catalytic site. From these results, we propose that Glu-24 and Glu-141 of CwlC and Glu-26 and Glu-142 of CwlV1 are the most likely candidates for the essential catalytic residues.Influence of Divalent Metal Cations on Amidase ActivityOur analysis shows that Zn2+ can serve as a cofactor for the activity of the CwlV amidase, but it is less effective than Mn2+ and Co2+. On the other hand, Mg2+ and Ca2+ are not entirely essential cofactors of the amidase.

We also observed a peak for the optimal concentration of Zn2+ at ∼0.2 mm and that of Co2+at ∼1.0 mm. But higher concentrations of these cations were inhibitory (data not shown).

Coexpression of PICK1 and mGluR7a in heterologous cells induces coclustering of these two proteins. To examine the role of the different structural motifs of PICK1 in synaptic aggregation of PICK1 and mGluR7a coclustering, several PICK1 mutants were generated to analyze their distribution in transfected hippocampal cultured neurons and to test their ability to induce coclusters with mGluR7a when coexpressed in fibroblast cells. The PDZ and coiled-coil domains are both required, whereas the acidic region plays an inhibitory role in these processes. Our data suggest that synaptic aggregation and receptor coclustering depend on PICK1 binding to a target membrane receptor, e.g. mGluR7a, by a PDZ-mediated interaction and on PICK1 oligomerization through the coiled-coil domain.

For instance, at glutamate excitatory synapses of the hippocampus, the ionotropic glutamateN-methyl-d-aspartate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylsoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)1 receptors are both concentrated at postsynaptic sites (1Takumi Y. Matsubara A. Rinvik E. Ottersen O.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Recent studies showed the importance of PDZ domain-containing proteins in mediating the specific synaptic aggregation of neurotransmitter receptors and in regulating receptor signaling at synapses (3Craven S.E.

However, PICK1 might not be primarily involved in the synaptic clustering or stabilization of AMPA receptors (13Osten P. Khatri L. Perez J.L. Kohr G. Giese G. Daly C. Schulz T.W. Wensky A. Lee L.M.

PICK1 interaction with the dopamine transporter has been implicated in the proper targeting of the latter in midbrain dopaminergic neurons (12Torres G.E. Yao W. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thus, PICK1 could have different functions depending on the cerebral region and the specific complement and nature of PICK1 binding partners. In accordance with its biological effects, immunocytochemical data demonstrated that PICK1 is concentrated at excitatory synapses in hippocampal cultured neurons (7Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 485-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of PICK1 immunoreactivity in synaptic vesicle fractions as well as in postsynaptic density fractions (7Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Huganir R.L.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that PICK1 is expressed in both presynaptic and postsynaptic domains. PICK1 distribution has been shown to be dynamically regulated upon PKC activation, which triggered mobilization of PICK1 to excitatory synaptic sites (15Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular determinants within PICK1 important for synaptic clustering and receptor coclustering are unknown. Although the three-dimensional structure of PICK1 is not known, its primary structure contains motifs that predict the existence of different structural domains including a PDZ domain, a coiled-coil domain, and an acidic region constituted of a stretch of glutamic and aspartic acid residues. PDZ and coiled-coil domains are typically involved in protein-protein interaction and/or protein dimerization (20Burkhard P. Strelkov S.V. Stetefeld J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 21Lupas A. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Indeed, the putative carboxylate binding loop in the PICK1 PDZ domain has been shown to bind the C terminus of PKC, GluR2/3, and mGluR7a (8Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 9Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S.

To examine the role of the different structural domains of PICK1 in the mechanisms underlying PICK1 synaptic localization and mGluR7a coclustering, several Myc epitope-tagged mutant PICK1 constructs were generated to analyze their distribution in transfected hippocampal cultured neurons. In addition, their ability to induce coclusters with mGluR7a was tested when coexpressed in fibroblast cells. We show that the three domains correspond to functional signals for PICK1 synaptic localization and mGluR7a coclustering; the PDZ and coiled-coil domains are both required, whereas the acidic region plays an inhibitory role in these processes. Our data suggest that synaptic aggregation and receptor coclustering depend on PICK1 binding to a target membrane receptor, e.g. mGluR7a, by a PDZ-mediated interaction and on PICK1 oligomerization through the coiled-coil domain. All the PICK1 cDNA constructs used for mammalian cell expression described in this study contained a Myc-epitope tag of 12 amino acids originally inserted into the pRK5 vector (modified from Genentech) to produce N-terminally tagged proteins. PICK1-WT and PICK1 mutated in its PDZ domain (mutation of Lys27 and Asp28 to alanines: PICK1-KD/AA) in pPC86 (8Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) were subcloned into theSalI/NotI sites of the Myc-pRK5 vector. PICK1 deleted of its coiled-coil domain (PICK1-ΔCC) and of its acidic region (PICK1-ΔDE) were obtained by a two-step polymerase chain reaction strategy using appropriate primers, and the resulting polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into theSalI/Eco47III sites andEco47III/NotI sites of Myc-pRK5-PICK1-WT for PICK1-ΔCC and PICK1-ΔDE construction, respectively. These mutants were then subcloned into pPC97 and pPC86 (24Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) for yeast expression. Several other constructs were generated for the yeast two-hybrid assay. Fragments corresponding to each domain of PICK1 were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification to generate the PDZ (encoding amino acids 20–110), PDZ-KD/AA (encoding amino acids 20–110 with Lys27 and Asp28 substituted to alanines), coiled-coil (CC, encoding amino acids 139–166), and acidic (DE, encoding amino acids 380–390) fragments. All of these fragments were inserted into the SalI/NotI sites of pPC97. Construction of GW1-mGluR7a and pPC97-CT7 (encoding the C-terminal tail of mGluR7a) was described previously (10Boudin H. Doan A. Xia J. Shigemoto R. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Craig A.M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 485-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryonic day-18 rat hippocampi were dissected and dissociated by trypsin and trituration. Before plating, neurons were transfected by a lipid-mediated gene transfer method using the Effectene kit (Qiagen). Approximately 4 × 105 cells were incubated with 1 µg of DNA for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 8 µl of Enhancer and 15 µl of Effectene transfection reagents and were then plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in fresh medium at a density of 14,000 cells/cm2. Cells were maintained in serum-free N2.1 medium suspended above a glial feeder layer cultured from newborn rat forebrain (25Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Rat Hippocampal Neurons in Low Density Culture in Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). For transfection after plating, 9 daysin vitro (DIV) neurons on coverslips were removed from the culture dish and incubated in the transfection mixture containing the plasmid DNA for 90 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were then placed back into the culture dish. At 15 DIV, the cells were fixed to proceed to the immunostaining. Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.25% Triton X-100. For experiments involving N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR1 immunostaining, neurons were fixed in methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. The cells were blocked for 30 min in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (clone 9E10) and anti-GAD6 were used at 1:40 and 1:2 dilutions, respectively (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); the rabbit anti-synapsin antibody was used at 1:10,000 (Sigma); the mouse anti-NR1 was used at a concentration of 0.1–0.3 µg/ml (PharMingen); and the rabbit anti-PICK1 (1:400) and rabbit anti-GluR1 (1:2000) were generous gifts from Dr. R. Huganir (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and Dr. R. McIlhinney (Oxford, United Kingdom), respectively. The cells were then incubated with appropriate Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories), and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides for microscopy analysis. Each coverslip was systematically scanned on a Zeiss Axioskop with an ×25 lens, and images of each transfected cell were acquired with a × 63 1.4 numerical aperture objective using a Photometrics Sensys cooled charge-coupled device camera and Metamorph software. The colocalization of recombinant Myc-PICK1-WT with synapsin, GluR1, and NR1 as well as PICK1-KD/AA, PICK1-ΔCC, and PICK1-ΔDE with synapsin was quantified using Metamorph software as described previously (26Rao A. Cha E.M. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8344-8353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity and size of the endogenous and recombinant Myc-PICK1-WT clusters were quantified on 60 and 150 clusters, respectively, using Metamorph software. For each Myc-PICK1 construct, between 30 and 60 transfected neurons were analyzed from 5 independent experiments. The images for presentation were prepared for printing with Adobe Photoshop. Fibroblast CV1 cells were cotransfected with mGluR7a-GW1 and Myc-PICK1-WT-pRK5 or Myc-PICK1-KD/AA-pRK5, or Myc-PICK1-ΔCC-pRK5, or Myc-PICK1-ΔDE-pRK5 cDNAs using the Effectene kit (Qiagen). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked for 30 min in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a mixture of rabbit anti-mGluR7a 1:2000 (generously provided by Dr. R. Shigemoto, Japan) and mouse anti-Myc 1:40 antibodies. The cells were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies, and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides for microscopy analysis. For each experiment (n = 3), coverslips were scanned, and all cotransfected cells were scored as exhibiting a diffuse or clustered mGluR7a/Myc-PICK1 staining. To test the interaction between two protein constructs, the corresponding cDNAs were cotransformed in the yeast strain PJ69-4A harboring the HIS3,ADE2, and lacZ reporter genes (27James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and positive clones were selected on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. The positive clones were further confirmed by growing in a medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine and were then tested in four independent experiments for β-galactosidase activity using a colorimetric assay (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 13.6.2-13.6.3Google Scholar). Positive clones in this assay were selected by a β-galactosidase activity of at least five times above the control values obtained from untransformed PJ69-4A yeast. The different PICK1 constructs PICK1-KD/AA, PICK1-ΔCC, and PICK1-ΔDE cloned into pPC97 (which contains the GAL4 binding domain) were tested for their interaction with PICK1-WT and the C-terminal tail of mGluR7a (CT7), both cloned into pPC86 (which contains the GAL4 DNA activation domain). Interaction of specific fragments of PICK1 inserted in pPC97 (PDZ, PDZ-KD/AA, CC, and DE fragments) were also tested with PICK1-WT in pPC86. To determine which domain of PICK1 is required for the synaptic localization and clustering properties, several Myc epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant protein constructs of PICK1 were generated and expressed in hippocampal cultured neurons by a lipid-mediated transfection. Initial experiments were conducted to determine whether the exogenously expressed recombinant wild-type Myc-PICK1 localized appropriately in neurons. Neurons were transfected either the day of plating or at 9 DIV. The distribution of the recombinant Myc-PICK1 was analyzed at 15 DIV by immunofluorescence using a Myc monoclonal antibody. Myc-PICK1 expressed by transfection was distributed in clusters along dendrites and, although to a lesser extent, along axons as well (Fig.1). In addition, some diffuse labeling was often detected, most prominently in large dendrites close to the cell body. Double labeling with the synaptic marker synapsin showed that most of the PICK1-containing clusters in both dendrites and axons were synaptic (Fig. 1). A similar distribution was observed in transfected pyramidal cells and interneurons, which represent the two types of cells present in this hippocampal culture model (differentiated based on both morphological features and glutamic acid decarboxylase immunostaining), suggesting no cell type-specific targeting of PICK1. No difference in either Myc-PICK1 distribution or intensity of immunoreactivity was observed between neurons transfected the day of plating or at 9 DIV. To compare the PICK1 expression level between transfected and untransfected neurons, quantitative analyses were performed in the same culture after PICK1 staining to label endogenous as well as exogenous PICK1. Although the intensity of PICK1 immunoreactivity was clearly much higher in a few neurons, likely corresponding to the transfected ones, double labeling with the Myc antibody was performed to confirm that these brighter PICK1-expressing neurons corresponded to the Myc-PICK1-transfected neurons. The fluorescence intensity and size of the recombinant Myc-PICK1 clusters determined by PICK1 immunostaining were on average four and six times higher, respectively, than for the endogenous protein. To determine whether the transfected PICK1 was selectively associated with excitatory synapses, as reported for the endogenous protein, double immunostainings were performed with markers for excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Fig. 2). Double immunolocalization of recombinant Myc-PICK1 and the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor showed a good overlap of the two proteins, although some clusters of Myc-PICK1 lacked concentrations of GluR1 and vice versa. Quantitative analysis indicated that 65% of transfected Myc-PICK1 clusters colocalized with GluR1. Similarly, 54% of recombinant PICK1 clusters were associated with theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR1-positive synapses. By contrast, no colocalization was observed between PICK1-positive clusters and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-positive synapses, indicating that recombinant PICK1 was specifically targeted to excitatory synapses and excluded from inhibitory ones. These data indicate that even with a high level of protein expression, the recombinant Myc-PICK1 expressed by transfection in hippocampal cultured neurons was specifically concentrated at a subset of excitatory synapses. Therefore, this transfected neuron system could be exploited to elucidate the function of the different structural domains of PICK1 in synaptic clustering properties. Analysis of the PICK1 amino acid sequence suggests the presence of three distinct structural domains: a PDZ domain (amino acids 20–110), a coiled-coil domain (amino acids 139–166), and an acidic region containing 10 acidic amino acids, either aspartic or glutamic acid residues (amino acids 380–390) (8Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 23Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To determine the involvement of each of these domains in the synaptic localization of PICK1, several constructs of PICK1 were generated by deletion or mutation, and the resulting PICK1 mutants were expressed by transfection in hippocampal-cultured neurons to study their distribution by immunofluorescence. A mutant of the putative carboxylate-binding loop of the PDZ domain was generated by substitution of the Lys-Asp residues into Ala-Ala residues (PICK1-KD/AA). This mutation has been shown to disrupt the interaction of PICK1 with protein kinase C (23Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), the AMPA glutamate receptor subunits GluR2/3 (8Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants of the coiled-coil domain and the acidic region were constructed by deletion of the whole coiled-coil domain (PICK1-ΔCC) or acidic region (PICK1-ΔDE), respectively. Similar to what was observed for the wild-type protein, all the mutated PICK1 variants were expressed in both dendrites and axons without any detectable differences. However, marked differences were observed with regard to their synaptic clustering ability (Fig.3). The mutants PICK1-KD/AA and PICK1-ΔCC did not form clusters but were diffusely distributed throughout the processes, although GluR1, NR1, and synapsin staining remained unaffected, suggesting that the synapses were normal (not shown). To compare the ability to form synaptic clusters among the different Myc-PICK1 constructs, quantitative analysis was performed on neurons double-labeled with the synaptic marker synapsin. The number of PICK1 synaptic clusters was recorded and normalized for 100 µm of dendrites (Fig. 4). PICK1-WT formed an average of 13 synaptic clusters/100 µm of dendrites, whereas only 3 synaptic clusters/100 µm of dendrites were observed in neurons transfected with PICK1-KD/AA or PICK1-ΔCC. The mutant PICK1-ΔDE showed a significant increase in the number of synaptic clusters compared with the wild-type protein, with an average of 21 clusters/100 µm of dendrites. Importantly, the average Myc-PICK1 immunofluorescence intensity measured in neuronal cell bodies was similar for the various constructs (Fig. 4), indicating that the differential distribution observed for the PICK1 mutants was not caused by a different protein expression level but rather to a different targeting mechanism. These data indicate that both the PDZ and coiled-coil domains are critical for PICK1 synaptic clustering and that the acidic region plays an inhibitory role in this process.Figure 4Quantitative analysis of Myc-PICK1 synaptic clusters in hippocampal neurons. A, schematic representation of the different Myc-PICK1 constructs. B, quantification of the number of Myc-PICK1 synaptic clusters/100 µm dendrites. Mutation of the PDZ domain and deletion of the coiled-coil domain significantly decrease the number of PICK1 synaptic clusters. By contrast, deletion of the acidic region significantly increases the number of synaptic clusters (for each construct, n = 30–60 cells from five independent experiments; t test, ***,p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01).C, quantification of the average somatic immunofluorescence intensity for each PICK1 construct shows no difference between each construct, suggesting that the level of expression is similar for the four different PICK1 constructs (n = 10 cells for each construct; t test, p > 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously reported that PICK1 and the mGluR7a receptor expressed alone in fibroblast cells were distributed diffusely throughout the cell but that coexpression of PICK1 and mGluR7a receptor induced coclustering of these two proteins (10Boudin H.

Kidera A. Nakamura H.

In the present study, we show that anti-NP Abs can be classified using the H3 rules and that this system coincided well with the maturation pathways. In addition, we also performed CD measurements of a series of anti-NP Abs and obtained evidence that the manner in which NP bound to the Ab depended on the maturation pathway employed.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in order to interpret the role of CDR-H3 in the conformational versatility of the Ag-combining site. In exploring 55 Ab structures from Protein Data Bank entries, we uncovered novel rules for the structural classification of CDR-H3 from the primary amino acid sequence only (8Shirai H. Kidera A. Nakamura H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and then established these as H3 rules by confirmation using 45 new entries of antibody structures (7Shirai H. Kidera A. Nakamura H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This set of rules also served to predict the flexibility of CDR-H3. In the present study, we show that anti-NP Abs can be classified using the H3 rules and that this system coincided well with the maturation pathways. In addition, we also performed CD measurements of a series of anti-NP Abs and obtained evidence that the manner in which NP bound to the Ab depended on the maturation pathway employed.

It occurs between the µ and δ genes and contains numerous transcription factor binding sites, predominantly octamer and µE5 motifs of consensus and variant sequences. It lacks the classical µA-µE3(CBF)-µB core array of binding motifs seen within mammalian IgH Eµ enhancers. To determine the functionally important motifs, a series of mutant enhancers was created using sequence-targeted polymerase chain reaction. Whereas the mutation of consensus and variant octamer motifs (individually or in multiples) decreased enhancer function, mutation of a single consensus µE5 motif destroyed the function of this enhancer in mammalian plasmacytomas. Mutation of this consensus µE5 site, combined with mutations of certain octamer sites, destroyed function in catfish B cells. Experiments using artificial enhancers containing multimers of motifs or short regions of the native enhancer suggested that the minimal Eµ3′ enhancer (a) contains a consensus µE5 site and two octamer sites, (b) is B cell-specific, and (c) is active across species.

In both mammals and bony fish the VH,1 D, JH, and C gene segments are in tandem arrays, also known as the translocon arrangement (1Rast J.P. Anderson M.K. Litman G.W. Honjo T. Alt F.W. Immunoglobulin Genes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 315-341Crossref Google Scholar). Within the IgH locus of mammals, there are six described enhancers, required for the processes of V-D-J recombination, class switching, somatic hypermutation, and expression of the functionally rearranged locus (2Chen J. Young F. Bottaro A. Stewart V. Smith R.K. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4635-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3Cogne M. Lansford R. Bottaro A. Zhang J. Gorman J. Young F. Cheng H.L.

These enhancers are both internal to and 3′ of the locus and are tightly regulated in function at different stages of B cell development (5Michaelson J.S. Giannini S.L. Birshtein B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Arulampalam V. Eckhardt L. Pettersson S. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Eµ enhancer, located in the JH-Cµ intron, is arguably the most important; not only is it required for expression of the rearranged IgH locus, but it also plays an important role in the processes of VH-D-JH recombination and somatic hypermutation and is not deleted by any of the recombination processes that occur during B cell development. The IgH locus of the channel catfish, the best-established model for the teleost immune system, is less complex than that of mammals; only two classes of immunoglobulin (IgM and IgD) are produced through alternative processing of the primary transcript from the IgH locus (7Wilson M.R. Bengten E. Miller N. Clem L.W. DuPasquier L. Warr G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4593-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Bengten E. Wilson M. Miller N. Clem L.W. Pilstrom L. Warr G.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 248: 189-219PubMed Google Scholar). Class switching by chromosomal recombination does not occur in teleost fish. The single identified enhancer (Eµ3′) driving IgH transcription is located in the µ-δ intergenic region (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and organization of Eµ and Eµ3′ differ greatly. Mammalian Eµ is ∼500 bp in length and contains several DNA binding motifs (µE1–5, E-box, µA, µB, CBF, Oct) each present only once (10Calame K. Ghosh S. Honjo T. Alt F.W. Immunoglobulin Genes. 2nd Ed.

Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3145-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Eµ3′ enhancer region of the channel catfish is considerably larger, 1.8 kilobases in length, and it contains many repeats of octamer and µE motifs of both consensus and variant sequences (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these differences Eµ and Eµ3′ are both strong B cell-specific transcriptional activators that function in both mouse and catfish B cells (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar, 13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W.

Here we report the results of an analysis of Eµ3′, defining the functional motifs essential for its activity and identifying a minimal enhancer. CAT reporter constructs to test enhancer function at a distal site were based upon those previously described (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar, 13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutated enhancers were inserted at the KpnI site of the pFVH/CAT/modified vector that contains the full promoter region of a goldfish VH gene (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar). To test DNA binding motifs and enhancer fragments at a proximal (promoter) position, the pΔ56/CAT construct was used (16Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This vector contains the minimal c-fos promoter, from −56 to +109 bp relative to the transcription start site, and includes a minimal TATA box (16Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). All PCR-generated enhancer or promoter fragments were made using Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), with restriction sites incorporated in the primer sequences to facilitate cloning. Mutagenesis of the full enhancer was performed in a modified pUC19 (Life Technologies, Inc.) vector, pUC19ΔHinDIII. TheHinDIII site of pUC19 was destroyed by digestion withHinDIII and Klenow fill-in to permit the screening of clones for mutations by the introduction of a HinDIII site. The 1782-bp enhancer fragment that contains full activity (ELF11), hereafter referred to as the full enhancer, was ligated into pUC19ΔHinDIII via the KpnI site of the polylinker and subjected to mutagenesis. After successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing, the mutant enhancer was recloned into theKpnI site of pFVH/CAT/modified (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers were designed to replace the DNA binding motif of interest with a sequence of identical length containing a HinDIII site. The only exception was the combined mutation of octamers 10 and 11, in which 13 bp between the two motifs were deleted. To create multiple DNA binding motif mutations in a single construct, PCR mutagenesis was performed on enhancers in which sites had already been mutated. For PCR amplification of longer sequences (including complete vectors) the ExpandTM long template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or GeneAmp® XL PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were utilized. The bp number refers to the position of the DNA binding motif in 12C (recombinant catfish genomic λ-phage clone, EMBL accession number X79482), and the HinDIII sites are underlined (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar). Motifs were selected for mutation based on their degree of similarity to the mammalian consensus motifs and, in the case of octamer motifs, their ability to drive transcription (13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The five motifs that have previously been demonstrated to show the strongest transcriptional activity, i.e. octamers 5, 7, 10, 11, and 14 were selected for mutation. The remaining octamer motifs have been shown to be inactive or only weakly active in catfish B cells (13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers (upper and lower) for use with the ExpandTM and GeneAmp® XL PCR kits were as follows: octamers 10 and 11 at 10,695 and 10,716 bp, 5′-TTTAAGCTTGTAGCACTTCTTCCTGTGCAGGTG-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTGCAGTGTTTTGCCTGTTATGTAAA-3′; octamer 7 at 10,217 bp, 5′-TTTAAGCTTAAGTTTGGTCTGTTCTCTGTTTCTTC-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTTTGTAGTTTCTGTACTCATTTCACCT-3′; octamer 14 at 11,308 bp, 5′-TTTAAGCTTATATTCACTCACCAAAAAGGCAGT-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTTTACTGGCCAATTATGTTTGACC-3′; µE3 motif at 10,135 bp, 5′-ATAAAGCTTAAATGGCTACGTTTTTTGATCTA-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTCAGCAATATATTCTCTTTGTTACT-3′; µE5-1 and octamer 5 at 9,844 and 9,848 bp, 5′-TTTAAGCTTAATAATCAACACCTTGAAATTGTT-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTAAGAAATATGTCTATCATATTCTA-3′; µE5-2 (mammalian consensus) at 10,740 bp, 5′-TTTAAGCTTTCACTCCATCTCAGAGATGCAG-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTCAGGAAGAAGTGCTACATTTACAT-3′; µE5-3 at 10,896 bp, 5′-TTTAAGCTTAAACACGAAAAACTGT GAAACAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTGGCTAGAGGAAGGAGTGCAGGACA-3′; µE5-4 at 11,378 bp, 5′-TTTAAGCTTCAACTTATGACCT GATTGTCACAA-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTAGACAAGAGAGAAAATCATACATT-3′. Because the mammalian consensus octamer motif (octamer 5) overlaps the µE5-1 variant, the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate the non-overlapping bases, thereby preserving one motif and mutating the other to an inactive sequence (the mutation is underlined). Mutagenic primers for use in this protocol were as follows: octamer 5, 5′-ATATTTCTTACACATGCAGGGAATCAACACCTTGAAATTG-3′ and 5′-GACAATTTCAAGGTGTTGATTCCCTGCATGTGTAAGAAATATG-3′; µE5-1, 5′-GATAGACATATTTCTTATGTATGCAAATAATCAACACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTTGATTATTTG- CATACATAAGAAATATGTCTATC-3′. Multimers of motifs were created to test the ability of an individual motif to drive transcription at a proximal position relative to the CAT reporter gene. Oligonucleotides were designed to contain three direct repeats of a DNA binding motif centered 20 bp apart. The oligonucleotides (Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina) were synthesized such that, after annealing, HinDIII overhangs would be created to facilitate cloning. Oligonucleotide pairs containing three copies of the binding motifs (bold, underlined) were as follows: µE5-1 variant DNA binding motif, 5′-AGCTTGATACACATGCAGAACGCGTACTTACACATGCAGACTCGAGTACT TACACATGCAGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCTGCATGTGTAAGTACTCGAGTCTGCATGTGTAAGTACGCGTTCTGCATGTGTATCA-3′; µE5-2 mammalian consensus DNA binding motif, 5′-AGCTTGATTGCAGGTGTGGAACGCGTACTTTGCAGGTGTGGACTCGAGTACTTTGCAGGTGTGGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCCACACCTGCAAAGTACTCGAGTCCACACCTGCAAAGTACGCGTTCCACACCTGCAATCA-3′; µE5-3 variant DNA binding motif, 5′-AGCTTGATACACCGGCAGAACGCGTACTTACACCGGCAGACTCGAGTACTTACACCGGCAGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCTGCCGGTGTAAGTACTCGAGTCTGCCGGTGTAAGTACGCGTTCTGCCGGTGTATCA-3′; µE5-4 variant DNA binding motif, 5′-AGCTTGATTAGGTGTTGAACGCGTACTTTAGGTGTTGACTCGAGTACTTTAGGTGTTGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCAACACCTAAAGTACTCGAGTCAACACCTAAAGTACGCGTTCAACACCTAATCA-3′; µE3 variant DNA binding motif, 5′-AGCTTGATTACCACATGAGAACGCGTACTTTACCACATGAGACTCGAGTACTTTACCACATGAGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCTCATGTGGTAAAGTACTCGAGTCTCATGTGGTAAAGTACGCGTTCTCATGTGGTAATCA-3′; mammalian consensus octamer (octamer 5) DNA binding motif, 5′-AGCTTGATATGCAAATGAACGCGTACTTATGCAAATGACTCGAGTACTTATGCAAATGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCATTTGCATAAGTACTCGAGTCATTTGCATAAGTACGCGTTCATTTGCATATCA-3′; octamer 10 and 11 DNA binding motif, 5′-AGCTTGATATGTAAATGAACGCGTACTTATGTAAATGACTCGAGTACTTATGTAAATGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCATTTACATAAGTACTCGA- GTCATTTACATAAGTACGCGTTCATTTACATATCA-3′. After annealing, the double-stranded DNA fragment was purified by electrophoresis on a 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by electroelution. Purified fragments were cloned into theHinDIII site of the pΔ56 c-fos/CAT construct. Clones were sequenced to confirm the presence and copy number of the motif. Reporter constructs containing the full enhancer (Eµ3′) or small regions (∼300 bp) of the full enhancer were generated by PCR and inserted into the pΔ56 c-fos/CAT vector at theHinDIII site in the same orientation as they appear in the full enhancer. Primers designed to amplify the full enhancer (Eµ3′) with the addition of HinDIII ends were as follows: 5′-TTTAAGCTTACATCATCTAGCCTACCATAAGTA-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTCAGAGAAGACGGCACTACTATATG-3′. Primers designed to amplify region 1 (see Fig. 1) of the full enhancer, which contains the mammalian consensus octamer 5, variant µE5-1 motif, and variant octamer 6, with the addition of HinDIII ends were as follows: 5′-TTTAAGCTTCAAAAAGCAAAAAGCACTCTTTAC-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTGCATCTCTGAGATGGAGTGAAAC-3′. Primers designed to amplify region 2 (see Fig. 1) of the full enhancer, which contains variant octamer 10, variant octamer 11, and the mammalian consensus µE5-2 motif, with the addition ofHinDIII ends were as follows: 5′-TTTAAGCTTAAGCCTTTTTAGAATATGATAGAC-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTGTATCTCTCTTTTTTATGGTGAAT-3′. Primers designed to amplify region 3 (see Fig. 1) of the full enhancer, which contains the octamer variant 13 motif, variant octamer 14, and variant µE5-4 motif, with the addition of HinDIII ends were as follows: 5′-TTTAAGCTTACAGAAAATTAAGAGAAAGGATG-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGCTTGTGACAATCAGGTCATAAGTTGAAC-3′. PCR-amplified regions from the full enhancer were purified by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels and extracted using the NucleoTrap gel extraction kit (Clontech). Clones were sequenced to confirm enhancer fragment presence, sequence, and copy number. Plasmids for mutagenesis and transfection were prepared by transformation of chemically competent XL1 Blue MRF′ cells (Stratagene), grown under ampicillin selection. Subsequent purification of DNA was accomplished using QiaFilter Plasmid maxi and mega kits (Qiagen). The catfish B lymphoblastoid cell line 1B10 and the catfish T cell line G14D, derived from mitogenic stimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes, have been described previously (17Miller N.W. Rycyzyn M.A. Wilson M.R. Warr G.W. Naftel J.P. Clem L.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2180-2189PubMed Google Scholar). These cell lines were maintained in AL-5 medium (50% AIM V (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50% Leibovitz-L15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) adjusted to catfish isotonicity by diluting 9:1 with water). AL-5 was supplemented with heat-inactivated catfish serum to a final concentration of 5% (17Miller N.W. Rycyzyn M.A. Wilson M.R. Warr G.W. Naftel J.P. Clem L.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2180-2189PubMed Google Scholar), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (ICN), 100 units/ml penicillin (ICN), 50 µm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma). 1B10 and G14D cells were cultured at 27 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The murine plasmacytoma cell lines J558L and S194 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a final concentration of 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. All transfections were done using a BTX600 electroporator and 2-mm gap cuvettes (Biotechnologies & Experimental Research, Inc.). Cells were harvested during logarithmic growth, washed in serum-free RPMI 1640 (at the appropriate tonicity), and resuspended again in serum-free RPMI 1640 for transfection. Directly prior to transfection, 180 µl of cells (8 × 106 cells of 1B10, 5 × 106 cells of G14D, or 4 × 106 cells of J558L and S194) were mixed with 20 µl of a DNA mixture. DNA solutions contained 2.3–8.9 pmol (7–21 µg) of DNA depending on the cell line transfected. Three to nine µg of a second DNA construct, pRSV/Luc (18de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 6: 725-737Crossref Scopus (2466) Google Scholar), expressing firefly luciferase driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, were cotransfected to permit assessment of transfection efficiencies. Optimal electroporation values were determined as previously described (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1B10 cells harvested at a density of 3.5–4.0 × 106 cells/ml were electroporated at 210 V, 1100 microfarads, and 48 ohms. G14D cells harvested at a density of 2.6–3.0 × 106 cells/ml were electroporated at 190 V, 1100 microfarads, and 48 ohms. J558L and S194 cells, harvested at a density of 8.0 × 105cells/ml, were electroporated at 130 or 168 V, respectively, 1100 microfarads, and 48 ohms. Expression of reporter constructs was measured 30–48 h (depending upon the cell line) after electroporation. CAT and luciferase activities were measured using cell extracts prepared with Promega reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 100 µl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation and aliquoted for immediate use. Luciferase was measured using the Promega luciferase assay system (Promega) and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Instruments) set to standard sensitivity. Values were corrected to exclude background activity. CAT activity was measured using CAT assay graded-threo-[dichloroacetyl-1,2-14C]-chloramphenicol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and n-butyryl coenzyme A (Sigma) (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar). CAT values were corrected for background activity and for transfection efficiency by normalizing with luciferase values. Sequencing of PCR-mutated enhancers, Eµ3′ fragment multimers, and multimers of DNA binding was accomplished using the Circumvent DNA sequencing kit (New England Biolabs) or the sequencing facility of the Medical University of South Carolina. Although it has previously been demonstrated that transcription of the catfish IgH locus is driven by the Eµ3′ enhancer (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar), the motifs and transcription factors through which it functions are unknown. Indeed, the Eµ3′ enhancer contains significant numbers of motifs that have the potential to contribute to function. As illustrated in Fig.1, these include 10 consensus and variant octamer motifs, of which eight have been shown to be transcriptionally active (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar), a single variant µE3 site, and four µE5 sites of consensus or variant sequence. To determine the degree to which each of these sites might contribute to enhancer function, targeted mutations were made in the enhancer. In an initial experiment each µE5 site and the µE3 site were mutated individually, whereas the consensus octamer 5 (ATGCAAAT) was mutated in conjunction with the µE5-1 site that it overlaps, and the closely spaced dimer of octamers (octamers 10 and 11) of identical sequence (ATGtAAAT) were mutated together. The function of the mutated enhancers was tested in mouse plasmacytomas S194 (Fig. 2A) and J558L (Fig.2 B) and the catfish B cell line 1B10 (Fig. 2 C). The effects of mutating specific motifs varied between the mammalian and catfish cell lines. In the murine cell lines S194 and J558L, mutation of the µE5-3 and µE5-4 sites was either without effect or resulted in a small increase in activity. Mutation of the µE3 motif or the µE5-1 site (which overlaps the consensus octamer 5) produced a slight decrease in activity in mammalian cells. The mutation of the octamer pair (octamers 10 and 11) reduced enhancer function by 30–40%, but the most striking effect was seen with mutation of the mammalian consensus µE5 site (number 2), which essentially eliminated function in the enhancer (Fig. 2, A and B). The effects of these mutations were different when tested in catfish B cells (Fig. 2 C). All of the mutations reduced activity to some extent, with loss of the µE5-4 site or µE5-1 site and overlapping consensus octamer 5 having the least effect (∼20% reduction in activity) and the consensus µE5-2 having the greatest effect, with a 55% reduction in activity. Thus, whereas the µE5-2 motif is essential to the function of the enhancer in murine plasmacytomas, in the homologous (catfish) B cells it can be inferred to cooperate with additional transcription factor binding motifs. Because the effect of mutating the overlapping consensus octamer (ATGCAAAT) and µE5-1 (variant) site reduced enhancer function in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2), the role that each of the two overlapping sites played, individually, in the native enhancer was examined. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to destroy one site while leaving the other intact. Mutation of the variant µE5-1 site alone increased enhancer activity by 30%, whereas mutation of the consensus octamer motif decreased transcription by 40% (Fig. 2 D), showing that the functional site is the consensus octamer and that the presence of the overlapping µE5-1 site reduces its activity. Constructs in which the consensus µE5-2 motif was mutated in combination with octamer motifs were tested in catfish B cells (Fig. 3A). A combination of the µE5-2 mutation with mutations of any one of five octamer sites further reduced the residual activity of the enhancer. The degree of this reduction depended on the particular octamer(s). Combining the mutation of µE5-2 with the octamer dimer 10 and 11 essentially eliminated all function of the enhancer in catfish B cells (Fig.3 A). When the µE5-2 motif mutation was combined with that of octamers 7 or 14, the reductions in activity, in catfish B cells, were 86 and 75%, respectively. Mutation of the consensus octamer 5, in combination with the consensus µE5-2 motif, also showed a greater than 90% reduction in activity (Fig. 3 A). When tested in mammalian J558L cells (Fig. 3 B), enhancers with combined mutations of the consensus µE5-2 site and the octamer sites showed no activity, as predicted from the effects of deleting the µE5-2 site alone (Fig. 2 B). From these results (Figs. 2and 3) it appears that factors bound to the µE5-2 motif and as many as five octamer sites act synergistically in the Eµ3′ enhancer in catfish B cells. With the consensus µE5-2 motif left intact, mutation of three octamer sites (the variant octamer dimer composed of octamer motifs 10 and 11, along with the consensus octamer 5, which also overlaps the µE5-1 site) reduced function in catfish B cells by only around 35% (Fig. 3 A), a similar effect to that seen with mutation of the octamer pair (octamers 10 and 11) alone. However, mutation of this particular combination of three octamer motifs reduced enhancer function by >70% in murine J558L plasmacytoma cells (Fig. 3 C), indicating further differences in the function of this enhancer in fish and mouse B cells. Because mutations of several octamer motifs and the consensus µE5-2 motif strongly affect native enhancer function, the ability of these individual motifs to drive transcription of a reporter construct was tested. Trimers of µE5 and µE3 failed to function as promoters in both catfish and murine cell lines (Fig. 4, Aand B). In contrast, trimers of octamer sequences, either consensus 5 or variant 10 and 11, increased the rate of transcription in both catfish and mouse B cell lines 14–17-fold. These results indicate that in catfish B cells, the function of µE motifs is dependent upon the presence of additional transcription factors bound to other sites, whereas octamer motifs are functional by themselves when associated with a minimal promoter. Inspection of the organization of the Eµ3′ enhancer (Fig. 1) reveals that it contains a repeating substructure: a µE5 motif associated with two octamer motifs. This occurs three times (regions 1–3; Fig. 1). The results of the motif mutation experiments suggest that the second of these regions (containing the µE5-2 consensus and octamers 10 and 11) may be a minimal functional unit within the enhancer, and experiments were undertaken to test this and to determine whether the other two regions (1 and 3; Fig. 1) were transcriptionally active. Accordingly, fragments ∼300 bp in length were PCR-amplified from the three regions of the native enhancer identified in Fig. 1 and ligated into reporter constructs. In catfish B cells the full enhancer increased reporter activity 6-fold, whereas enhancer region 2 (containing the µE5-2 and octamer 10 and 11 motifs) increased reporter gene expression almost 5-fold. Other regions failed to activate transcription above control levels (Fig. 5A). To test the contribution of the consensus µE5-2 site to the function of this fragment, this motif was mutated. This mutation reduced the activity of the enhancer fragment, as was also observed upon mutation of this motif within the full enhancer (Fig. 2 C). When tested in murine J558L cells (Fig. 5 B), the full enhancer increased reporter activity almost 15-fold, whereas region 2 alone increased reporter gene expression almost 10-fold. Other regions failed to activate transcription above control levels. Mutation of the mammalian consensus µE5-2 site from region 2 reduced activity by more than 60% in J558L cells (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether the activity of region 2 was B cell-specific, its ability to activate transcription in catfish T cells was evaluated (Fig. 5 C). Both the full enhancer and all three regions of the enhancer failed to drive transcription of the reporter gene in these T cells. Thus, region 2 of the enhancer shows the same B cell specificity as the full enhancer (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar, 13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Ross D.A. Magor B.G.

The results of this study demonstrate that the function of Eµ3′, the enhancer driving expression of the IgH locus of the catfish, depends on transcription factors binding to a single consensus µE5 motif and to a number of octamer motifs, only one of which is of consensus sequence. This contrasts with the situation in the mammalian IgH locus, where, although µE5 and octamer sites play contributory roles in the enhancers, a number of other motifs play major, indeed essential, roles (19Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 236: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 20Dang W. Nikolajczyk B.S. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This is particularly clear in the case of the Eµ enhancer, found in the mammalian JH-Cµ intron, where the core of this enhancer has been shown to consist of a small region containing three motifs: a µA site, a µE3 or a CBF site, and a µB site (21Erman B. Cortes M. Nikolajczyk B.S. Speck N.A. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The factors binding to these sites (Ets-1 binding to µA, PU.1 binding to µB, and TFE 3 or core binding factor binding to the µE3/CBF site) interact in a manner that requires precise spacing and orientation of the binding sites (22Nikolajczyk B.S. Nelsen B. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4544-4554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rao E. Dang W. Tian G. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6722-6732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of additional sites in the catfish Eµ3′ enhancer cannot yet be completely discounted, there is no evidence that it utilizes ETS family transcription factors; nor does it appear to require TFE 3 binding sites (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar, 13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Of the multiple µE5 sites identified in the catfish enhancer, only the site of exact mammalian consensus sequence was shown to exert a major positive influence on transcription. In fact, the µE5-1 site, which differs by one base from consensus and which overlaps the consensus octamer site, appeared to have a negative influence, by depressing the contribution to function made by the overlapping octamer motif (Fig. 2). In contrast, the octamer sites within Eµ3′ that differed from consensus sequence by single base changes in the 5′half of the site (i.e. ATGC, the binding site for the POU-specific domain of Oct transcription factors) retained function. This is consistent with the previously described ability of these variant octamer sequences both to bind catfish Oct2 and to drive transcription in B cells when placed at the promoter site of a reporter construct (13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Ross D.A. Magor B.G. Middleton D.L. Wilson M.R. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Warr G.W. J.

Immunol. 1999; 23: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One unusual aspect of the catfish Eµ3′ enhancer revealed in the present study is the potential of multiple octamer sites to act cooperatively with a single consensus µE5 site. Although two of the octamers (octamers 10 and 11) are spaced two full turns of the DNA helix apart, which might facilitate the interaction of bound transcription factors, other octamers that are shown to have function in the enhancer are distributed over 1.4 kilobases. The consensus µE5 site is only 24 bp away from the closest functional octamer, whereas the other octamers that function are as far away from the µE5 site as 892 bp. This cooperative action of transcription factors bound to widely separated sites is consistent with the involvement of coactivators, the nature of which is not known. A coactivator, OCA-B2, has been postulated to explain the action of Oct2 bound to octamer sites in the mammalian Eµ enhancer (24Annweiler A. Muller-Immergluck M. Wirth T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3107-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Annweiler A. Zwilling S. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4250-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Wirth T. Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Zwilling S. Konig H. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Octamer-binding transcription factors (in particular two isoforms of Oct2) have been cloned in the catfish and show clear similarity with their mammalian homologues, including strong sequence conservation of the DNA binding site, the presence of N- and C-terminal domains that are probably transcriptional activators, and the ability to act synergistically with the OCA-B (BOB-1) coactivator (14Ross D.A. Magor B.G. Middleton D.L. Wilson M.R. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3874-3882PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ross D.A. Lyles M. Ledford B.E. Magor B.G. Wilson M.R. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). They have a restricted tissue distribution similar to that described for mammalian Oct2 (14Ross D.A. Magor B.G. Middleton D.L. Wilson M.R. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3874-3882PubMed Google Scholar). The factor(s) binding to the catfish µE5 site are not yet defined. In mammals the USF proteins, the E2A-encoded basic helix-loop-helix motif proteins E12 and E47, and the zinc finger protein ZEB bind to both µE5 and µE2 sites and are implicated in regulation of the Eµ enhancer in B cells (27Gregoire J.M. Romeo P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6567-6578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Sloan S.R. Shen C. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell.

Enhancer function dependent upon Oct transcription factors and factors bound to a µE5 site has not been described in mammalian systems. The definition of a B cell-specific functional subunit of the catfish Eµ3′ enhancer, which contains the consensus µE5 motif and two functional octamer motifs, and in which both µE5 and octamer sites are functional (Fig. 1), will permit the study of potential interactions between octamer- and µE5-binding transcription factors in a simpler system than is afforded by the full, native enhancer. The comparison of enhancers between the IgH loci of catfish and mammals reveals substantial differences that contrast with the overall conservation of exon structure observed in vertebrate Ig genes. The enhancers differ in position, size, composition, and mechanism of action. This probably reflects the complexity of the mammalian locus, which undergoes class switching by chromosomal recombination (which does not occur in fish), and a very complex program of B cell development (6Arulampalam V. Eckhardt L. Pettersson S. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In light of their substantial differences, it is surprising that the catfish Eµ3′ and mouse Eµ enhancers both function effectively and B cell-specifically when transfected across species (9Magor B.G. Wilson R.M. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5556-5563PubMed Google Scholar, 13Magor B.G. Ross D.A. Middleton D.L. Warr G.W. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This observation would be explicable if B lineage cells of all vertebrates possessed a large complement of transcription factors, of both tissue-specific and ubiquitous expression. Different Ig enhancers would then be able to use different combinations of these transcription factors to drive B cell-specific transcription, with the details of the particular mechanisms reflecting specific needs for fine control of B cell development and differentiation."

VMAT2 transports a wide range of substrates including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and is inhibited by a number of drugs including reserpine, tetrabenazine (TBZ), and ketanserin.

Based on amino acid sequence, the prediction is that VMAT2 has 12 transmembrane (TM) helices, a structural commonality with a number of other transporters including plasma membrane monoamine reuptake transporters and P-glycoprotein.

These studies have suggested important residues that may contribute to ligand binding and monoamine transport. In addition, two significant observations that have contributed VMAT2 structural information are the discovery that a lysine in predicted TM 2 and an aspartate in predicted TM 11 interact functionally as an ion pair (20Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol.

Although the reasonable inferences from molecular biology and the biochemical structural information from photoaffinity labeling have provided significant and novel information, a more general approach that can be applied to obtain structural information from the entire molecule and to map ligand binding sites has been sought. With a few notable exceptions, large membrane proteins like VMAT2 have represented an enormous challenge to structural biology, and in most cases still pose serious technical difficulties to analysis by crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Recently, a creative combination of protein engineering and biochemical methods has been applied to large membrane proteins including receptors, transporters, and ion channels, to obtain information about membrane protein structure, function, and ligand binding sites. Many of these methods utilize native or engineered cysteines as sites of unique chemical reactivity within the membrane protein, and require either a molecule that is devoid of native cysteine residues or a molecule with a non-reactive background of remaining cysteines for the assays being applied (22Frillingos S.

Cysteine-based assays, including site-directed labeling with chemical probes (i.e. sulfhydryl-reactive methanethiosulfonate reagents) and intramolecular cysteine cross-linking to determine helix proximity and orientation, have proven useful and general approaches.

Inspired by the example of a number of functional cysteine-less membrane proteins and the flexibility and utility of cysteine-based methods, we sought to apply such methods to the study of human VMAT2. In this paper, we report a study of the role of the 10 native cysteines in human VMAT2 expression, ligand binding, and monoamine transport, and demonstrate by cysteine replacement, derivatization, and protection experiments that certain cysteines are in important positions for human VMAT2 [3H]TBZOH binding and [3H]serotonin transport. The following materials used in this research were from the indicated sources (in parentheses): plasmids pCDNA 3.1- and pBlueBac 4.5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); Miniprep and large scale plasmid DNA preparation kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; Promega, Madison, WI; Bio-Rad); Amplitaq FS and Big Dye DNA sequencing reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, through University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center); COS-7 or -7L cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA; Life Technologies, Inc.); QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); gene-editor mutagenesis kit (Promega); restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; Promega); Pfu andTaq precision DNA polymerase (Stratagene); DMEM, penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, Fungizone, cell culture trypsin, and PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.); [3H]sodium borohydride, and [3H] serotonin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); tetrabenazine (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI); methanethiosulfonate reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada) ethylamine (MTSEA), ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET), and 2-sulfonatoethyl (MTSES, a gift from Dr. Cynthia Czajkowski, University of Wisconsin-Madison); anti-HA antibody (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA); cysteamine, polyethyleneimine, ATP, 2-mercaptoethanol, and anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma); goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibody, electroporation cuvettes, precast electrophoresis ready gels, SDS sample buffer, and prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad); Supersignal West pico chemiluminescent substrate and Superblock PBS blocking buffer (Pierce); Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); GF/B filters (Whatman via Fisher; or Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD); 0.22- and 0.45-µm filters (Millipore via Fisher); transfection-competentEscherichia coli (Stratagene; Novagen, Madison, WI); emulsifier Safe scintillation mixture (Packard, Meriden, CT). Other reagents (sucrose, HEPES, KCl, MgSO4, NaOH, KOH, Tris, DTT, additional restriction enzymes, etc.) were from reputable and readily available sources. A cDNA encoding human VMAT2 was the kind gift of Dr. Robert H. Edwards (University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA). 5′-Forward and 3′-reverse oligonucleotides with desired restriction sites (5′ BglII, 3′ HindIII) were used to amplify the cDNA by PCR, the restriction-cleaved PCR product was ligated into the plasmid pBlueBac 4.5, and the entire VMAT2 coding region was checked for mutations by DNA sequencing. The 3′ reverse PCR primer incorporated a FLAG epitope, enterokinase cleavage site, and a 6-histidine epitope at the C terminus of the protein, adding the amino acids -Y-K-D-D-D-D-K-H-H-H-H-H-H. The correct FLAG- and 6-histidine-tagged human VMAT2 cDNA was then subcloned from pBlueBac 4.5 into the mammalian cell expression plasmid pCDNA 3.1- at the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites. An N-terminal FLAG-tagged construct was compared with the C-terminal tagged construct in a single high concentration [3H]TBZOH binding experiment and found to have less overall ligand binding (data not shown). Therefore, all human VMAT2 constructs used in this study were derived from the initial C-terminal FLAG- and 6-histidine tagged construct, which hereafter will be referred to as “WT.” Except for the C-terminal epitope tags, the sequence of this base construct is identical to the sequences for human VMAT2 deposited in GenBank™ under accession nos. L14269 and L23205. Each of the 10 individual cysteine residues in human VMAT2 were replaced by one of several site-directed mutagenesis methods. In the incremental process of creating a cysteine-less human VMAT2, all of the cysteines were changed to serines. However in generating 10 separate single cysteine mutants, some cysteine replacements were to serine and some to alanine (as indicated in Fig. 1 C). The methods employed in the replacement of cysteines included the GeneEditor (Promega) and QuickChange (Stratagene) methods, a PCR-based method, and a mutually priming oligo extension method. In every case, the resulting constructs were thoroughly sequenced to ensure the absence of any unwanted mutations in the human VMAT2 protein. To facilitate assessment of relative expression levels by Western blot, each of the four consensus glycosylation sites were mutated in the third position, from N-X-(S/T) to N-X-(V/A), and an HA epitope was added (Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A) after arginine 94 in the large lumenal loop (see Fig. 2 B). (The four mutations were Thr58→ Ala, Thr86 → Val, Thr93 → Val, and Ser111 → Ala.) Constructs which had this set of mutations and the HA insertion were designated “G−HA,” for “glycosylation-negative, HA epitope” Additional desired mutations introduced by one of the above methods included “silent” mutations (which did not change the encoded protein sequence) to introduce restriction sites. Among others, these included a particularly usefulKpnI restriction site between predicted TM segments 2 and 3, and sites added with the replacement of many of the cysteine residues to facilitate screening by restriction digests.Figure 2A cysteine-less human VMAT2 is expressed but not functional. A, [3H]TBZOH ligand binding curves for WT human VMAT2, Cys-less VMAT2 (a construct in which all 10 cysteines were replaced by serines), and mock-transfected COS cells. The mock-transfected condition was treated the same as the other two conditions, including COS cell electroporation, but purified plasmid DNA was not added. Error bars show the S.E. of multiple measurements at each [3H]TBZOH concentration. WT, solid square; Cys-less,solid diamond; mock, solid triangle. Cys-less human VMAT2 does not show [3H]TBZOH binding or [3H]serotonin transport (data not shown) above the level of mock-transfected COS-7 cells. B, to facilitate detection by Western blot, the four consensus glycosylation sequences were mutated and an HA epitope tag was added, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This set of mutations was designated G−HA. C, Western blots of cell homogenates from COS cells transfected with the WT G−HA and Cys-less G−HA constructs showed equivalent levels of human VMAT2 G−HA immunoreactivity. An equal amount of transfected COS homogenate (2 µg, assessed by the Bradford protein assay) was loaded for each lane. These data demonstrated that the total lack of ligand binding or transport by Cys-less human VMAT2 was not due to significant differences in protein expression. Wild type COS cells showed no immunoreactivity at the position of G−HA human VMAT2, and very little HA immunoreactivity overall (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The large quantities of DNA needed for transfection and assay of human VMAT2 constructs in mammalian cells were obtained by growth in LB medium of transformed E. coli followed by DNA purification on Qiagen DNA Prep columns. COS-7 cells were grown on 150-mm plates at 37 °C in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc. catalog no. 11965-084) with 9% cosmic calf serum (HyClone catalog no. SH30087.02), penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (10 ml/liter; Life Technologies catalog no. 10378-016), in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. On some occasions the medium was also supplemented with less than 2 mg/liter anti-mycotic fungizone (amphotericin B), which at the concentration used did not seem to have any noticeable effect on the growth or appearance of the COS cells, or on expressed human VMAT2 function. For most experiments, three 150-mm plates of COS-7 cells were transfected for each VMAT construct being tested. As an internal control, WT (C-FLAG/His) human VMAT2 was transfected and assayed on each occasion of COS cell expression. Transfection was performed by electroporation of COS cells in PBS with 15–50 µg of DNA (equal for all constructs in a given experiment) in 0.4-cm gap width cuvettes with the voltage of the Bio-Rad GenePulser/capacitance extender unit set at 0.226 mV and the capacitance set at 0.950 microfarads. Cells were harvested 1.5–4 days after transfection, the cell culture medium usually being changed once within that time period. Cells were detached with trypsin, washed with 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), protease inhibitor-containing buffer (generally 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 100 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 µm benzamidine, 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and homogenized with a custom-built steel ball homogenizer, or “cell cracker” (29Martin T.F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 168: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After 30–50 passages through the cell cracker, the homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 735 × g, and the vesicle containing supernatant was collected for use in assays. Protein concentrations for COS vesicle preparations were assessed by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and were generally in the range of 2–5 mg/ml. Thus, assays that used 50 µl of COS homogenate generally contained between 0.1 and 0.25 mg of total protein. Assays were performed on freshly prepared samples (not frozen) of COS cell homogenates, and results were normalized per milligram of COS homogenate protein. The radioligand used in binding assays was [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine ([3H]TBZOH). This was synthesized by reaction at room temperature of equal volumes (0.5–1 ml) of a 1.5 mg/ml solution of TBZ in 100% methanol with 5–25 mCi of [3H]sodium borohydride (50–75 Ci/mmol, in 0.1 m NaOH). Reduction occurs at the ketone, incorporating the 3H label. After >3 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated under a stream of nitrogen, diluted with 100% methanol, reconcentrated a number of times to remove water, and then streaked onto a silica gel TLC plate and developed with a solvent mixture of 5 parts ethyl acetate to 1 part methanol. The major [3H]TBZOH product, in a chemical amount visible upon illumination with a hand-held UV light, migrated with an approximate RF of 0.75, and was confirmed by comparison with the nonradioactive standard compound. The [3H]TBZOH was extracted from the silica gel with five 1-ml aliquots of methanol and quantitated by scintillation counting. The resulting [3H]TBZOH was chemically stable for use during at least 2 years when stored at −20 °C. Ligand binding curves were performed by incubation of 50 µl of COS homogenate (generally 2–5 µg/µl protein by the Bradford protein assay) with 200 µl of 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) buffer containing the [3H]TBZOH. Curves were derived from binding measurements at four to seven different concentrations of [3H]TBZOH, generally in the range of 1–50 nm. Specific binding was assessed by addition of excess non-radioactive TBZ (∼50 µm). In addition to some nonspecific or non-TBZ-protectable binding, it was found that non-transfected COS cells themselves have a low level of “specific,” or TBZ-protectable, [3H]TBZOH binding. This was controlled for by performing parallel analysis of non-transfected or mock-transfected COS cells. In instances where this was not done (some of the many binding curves summarized in Fig. 1 C), a calculated adjustment was made by subtracting an average COS cell specific binding background value (derived from multiple experiments) at each ligand concentration. Ligand binding at 30 °C reached a maximum level by ∼10 min (data not shown), but was generally allowed to proceed for >20 min. Monoamine uptake experiments were performed by incubation at 30 °C of 50 µl of COS homogenate in the presence or absence of ∼50 µm TBZ (5 µm proton ionophore FCCP inhibited uptake to the same extent, data not shown) with 200 µl of buffer (sucrose/HEPES/protease inhibitors/ATP and salts) for final concentrations of 50 nm[3H]serotonin, 5 mm ATP, 5 mmMgSO4, 4 mm KCl. From time-course studies, 3 min was considered to be in the initial linear range, and steady state accumulation was reached by times shortly after 5 min. Human VMAT2-containing vesicles with bound [3H]TBZOH or accumulated [3H]serotonin were collected on filters (usually Whatman GF/B, occasionally Millipore nitrocellulose/cellulose acetate) by vacuum filtration on Millipore 12-well filtration manifolds or on a Brandel M-48 BIT cell harvester. Ligand binding and uptake assays, which were vacuum-filtered on the Millipore manifolds, were performed in glass test tubes, and the test tubes were generally rinsed with 2 × 4 ml of buffer (which was also vacuum-filtered). Assays filtered using the Brandel cell harvester were performed in 1.2-ml well volume polypropylene 96-well plates, and the wells were rinsed with 5 × 1 ml of buffer. Radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting in a Packard model 1600CA or 2000CA scintillation counter. Bradford protein assays were used to quantitate protein concentrations to ensure equal loading of COS homogenate for each construct in Western blots. Protein samples were dissolved in SDS sample buffer at a protein concentration of 0.1–0.5 µg/µl, and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigels (12%). Proteins were transferred to a 0.2-µm nitrocellulose membrane, and nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the blot 1 h or longer in Superblock PBS (Pierce) + 0.05% Tween 20. Anti-HA antibody was diluted 1:850–1:1000 in 15 ml of Superblock + 0.05% Tween and allowed to bind for 1 h or longer, followed by at least six washes of 5 min or longer with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. The secondary antibody conjugate was goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), diluted 1:50,000–1:65,000 in 15 ml of Superblock, 0.05% Tween, and was allowed to bind for at least 1 h, followed by a second set of six 5-min washes in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween. Pierce ECL reagents were used following the manufacturer's recommendations, and then the blots were imaged using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sulfhydryl modifying MTS reagents or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (added from concentrated solution stocks) were allowed to react with transfected COS cell vesicles (generally 0.10–0.25 mg in a 50-µl volume) containing WT human VMAT2 and cysteine replacement constructs at sulfhydryl-reagent concentrations of 0.5–5 mm, as indicated in the figures. Parallel reactions were performed on mock-transfected COS cells and were subtracted as background. Reaction occurred for 10 min at 30 °C, in a volume of 50 µl, after which the reaction was diluted 10- or 20-fold (to a volume of 500 or 1000 µl) by addition of [3H]TBZOH-containing sucrose/HEPES buffer to terminate (or greatly reduce the rate of) any further cysteine modification reaction. Supporting this role for the dilution step, treatment with low concentrations of MTSEA (0.2 mm) for 10–20 min at 30 °C has essentially no effect on [3H]TBZOH binding by WT human VMAT2 (data not shown). In an experiment assessing the ability of NEM to block reaction at the MTSEA primary site, pretreatment was performed sequentially with the two cysteine-modifying reagents (i.e. first 1.5 mm NEM, then 3 mm MTSEA) for 10 min each prior to dilution. Dilution with [3H]TBZOH-containing buffer initiated the ligand binding portion of the experiment, which was for >15 min at 30 °C, and was followed by filtration and scintillation counting. In experiments assessing the ability of 100 mm DTT, β-mercaptoethanol, or cysteamine to reverse the effects of MTSEA derivatization, 100 mm reducing agent was added to the COS vesicles with the [3H]TBZOH-containing dilution buffer (after 10-min pretreatment of the COS vesicles with 2 mm MTSEA) and was present throughout the ligand binding incubation period. For the experiment demonstrating the requirement for sulfhydryl reactivity for MTSEA efficacy, the concentrated stock solution of MTSEA (25 mm) was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with an 8-fold molar excess of β-mercaptoethanol (200 mm) prior to addition to the homogenized COS vesicles. During MTSEA reaction with human VMAT2-containing COS vesicles, the MTSEA concentration was 2 mm, and the β-mercaptoethanol concentration was 16 mm. Subsequent 10-fold dilution with [3H]TBZOH-containing sucrose/HEPES buffer to initiate the [3H]TBZOH binding portion of the experiment resulted in final concentrations of 0.2 mm MTSEA, 1.6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 nm [3H]TBZOH. [3H]TBZOH protection against MTSEA inhibition of ligand binding was demonstrated by an assay that utilized [3H]TBZOH both to protect the binding site during the MTSEA reaction and as radioligand during the ligand binding experiment. Parallel MTSEA inhibition curve experiments were performed with the same concentrations of MTSEA, with [3H]TBZOH added either before or after treatment with MTSEA. For all conditions, a control experiment was performed with mock-transfected COS cells and subtracted as background. As with the other assays, results were normalized for the amount of COS homogenate protein, which for this set of experiments varied slightly between constructs in the range of 0.11–0."
https://openalex.org/W1993867787,"Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) has five domains: a, b, b′, a′ and c, all of which except c have a thioredoxin fold. A single catalytic domain (a or a′) is effective in catalyzing oxidation of a reduced protein but not isomerization of disulfides (Darby, N. J., and Creighton, T. E. (1995) Biochemistry34, 11725–11735). To examine the structural basis for this oxidase and isomerase activity of PDI, shuffled domain mutants were generated using a method that should be generally applicable to multidomain proteins. Domains a and a′ along with constructs ab, aa′, aba′, ab′a′ display low disulfide isomerase activity, but all show significant reactivity with mammalian thioredoxin reductase, suggesting that the structure is not seriously compromised. The only domain order that retains significant isomerase activity has the b′ domain coupled to the N terminus of the a′ domain. This b′a′c has 38% of the isomerase activity of wild-type PDI, equivalent to the activity of full-length PDI with one of the active sites inactivated by mutation (Walker, K. W., Lyles, M. M., and Gilbert, H. F. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 1972–1980). Individual a and a′ domains, despite their very low isomerase activities in vitro, support wild-type growth of apdi1Δ Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain yeast. Thus, most of the PDI structure is dispensable for its essential function in yeast, and high-level isomerase activity appears not required for viability or rapid growth. Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) has five domains: a, b, b′, a′ and c, all of which except c have a thioredoxin fold.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 2Creighton T.E. Zapun A. Darby N.J. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 18-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI),1 a major 55-kDa protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions during protein folding that introduce disulfides and rearrange those that are incorrectly paired (1Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Structurally, PDI consists of five discrete domains, each of which is structurally related to thioredoxin (3Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10517-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The catalytically active domains, like thioredoxin, also contain a CXXC motif that is responsible for the active site chemistry. The multidomain nature of PDI was initially recognized from an analysis of its amino acid sequence in which four domains, denoted a,b, b′, and a′, were identified. These four structural domains are followed by a stretch of acidic residues at the C terminus (designated c) (4Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The domain boundaries were confirmed and refined by proteolytic mapping and heterologous expression of individual domains (3Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10517-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The a anda′ domains are homologous both to each other (47% identity) and to thioredoxin (27% identity). Each of these domains contains an active site CGHC motif that can be reduced by mammalian thioredoxin reductase, which further supports a close structural relationship to thioredoxin (5Lundström J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The b and b′ domains have similar sequences (28% identical), but show no or very low sequence relatedness to thioredoxin. NMR structures of the isolated a and b domains provided the first detailed structural information about PDI. As expected, the structure of the a domain resembles that of thioredoxin (6Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), but surprisingly, the b domain also has a thioredoxin-like fold (7Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Sequence homology between the band b′ and a and a′ imply that PDI consists of four tandem domains with thioredoxin structure. Both the active sites contribute to PDI activity (8Vuori K. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the two domains are not equivalent in catalytic properties (9Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The isolateda and a′ domains are folded and catalytically active as oxidases with activities that approach that of the full-length molecule. However, neither domain by itself exhibits significant catalysis of disulfide isomerization during the refolding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (10Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Reconstruction of the PDI molecule from the isolated a anda′ domains results in a progressive increase in isomerase activity as more domains are added (11Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A recent study shows that theb′ domain provides the principal peptide-binding site of PDI, but other domains must contribute to the binding of larger protein substrates (12Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Sun et al., by contrast, report very low isomerase activity (∼10%) for all constructs with one or more domains deleted, including constructs that contain the b′domain (13Sun X. Dai Y. Liu H. Chen S. Wang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They suggest that all of the domains contribute significantly to the interactions between PDI and protein substrates. In yeast, haploid pdi1ΔD mutants are not viable (14Farquhar R. Honey N. Murant S.J. Bossier P. Schultz L. Montgomery D. Ellis R.W. Freedman R.B. Tuite M.F. Gene. 1991; 108: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, this lethal mutation can be rescued by the expression of full-length, wild-type PDI, or a mutant PDI in which one of the two active site cysteines is replaced with serine (CGHS) (15Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because CGHS mutants of PDI have very low oxidase activity (<2.5%) but reasonable isomerase activity (∼25%), it was concluded that the isomerase activity is essential. However, recent findings involving a pathway of electron transfer from substrate proteins to PDI and then to the ERO1 protein of the ER indicate that the oxidase function of PDI dominates kinetically over the isomerase activity in yeast (16Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A dominant role for PDI in ER protein oxidation would suggest that the requirements for high isomerase in vitro may not parallel structural and functional requirements for the features of the molecule that are required for efficient in vivo function. To clarify the relationships between the domain structure of PDI, the isomerase activity, and the ability to rescue the lethal deletion of PDI in yeast, we developed a new, general method for combining protein domains that may be useful in other systems with well defined domain boundaries. We have directly compared the catalytic properties of new and previously reported constructs under the same conditions. Our data show that the catalytically inactive domains, b′ andc, contribute significantly to isomerase activity only when they recapitulate the natural organization of the b′-a′-cdomains, suggesting that the a and b domains contribute little to the interactions of protein substrates with thea′ domain. The inactive b and b′domains may function to ensure that the catalytic domains can function independently. Although PDI mutants with low oxidase activity rescue the pdi1Δ mutation, no attempt has been made to rescue species that have normal oxidase activity but no isomerase activity. Surprisingly, the a and a′ domains not only rescue the lethal PDI1 deletion in yeast but support wild-type growth rates, despite a very low in vitro isomerase activity. There is no correlation between in vitro isomerase activity and the ability to support wild-type growth in vivo. Either a very small amount of isomerase activity is required to support substrate isomerization in vivo or the ER environment provides additional mechanisms to supplement substrate isomerization. The cloned gene for rat PDI was kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Edman (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Recombinant rat thioredoxin reductase containing selenocysteine was a kind gift of Dr Elias Arner (18Arner E.S. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol.

Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and dithiothreitol (DTT) were from Saveen Biotech AB. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. The yeast strain carrying the Δpdi1 null mutation was obtained from Ron Raines (Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) (15Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol.

Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the extinction coefficients listed in Table I. Reduced RNase (10 mg) was prepared by incubating with DTT (130 mm) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 6 m Guanidine-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 with glacial acetic acid, and the protein was separated from excess DTT and buffer by gel filtration (PD10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mm HCl. Reduced RNase was stored at −20 °C in aliquots. Thiol content was determined according to (19Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar). The formation of active RNase was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring hydrolysis of the RNase substrate, cCMP, at 296 nm (20Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F.

Each sample cuvette contained 4.5 mm cCMP, 1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm GSSG, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0–40 µm RNase and 1 µm PDI or 5 µm PDI variants. The assay was performed at 25 °C and initiated by the addition of RNase. The concentration of native RNase at any time was calculated from the first derivative of the absorbance with respect to time and corrected for the depletion of cCMP and the product inhibition of RNase by CMP. The initial velocity of RNase folding was determined from the steady-state slope of active RNase concentration versus time after the lag period.Table IPDI individual domains and domain combination used in this studyFragmentPDI residuesɛcm−1m−1aGlu-4 to Arg-11519300a′Val-352 to Gly-46215460bAla-120 to Leu-2171280b′Val-219 to Lys-3508490abGlu-4 to Leu-21720580b′a′Val-219 to Gly-46223950b′a′cVal-219 to Leu-49123950aa′Glu-4 to Arg-115Gly Ser Val-352 to Gly-46234760aba′Glu-4 to Leu-217 Gly Ser Val-352 to Gly-46236040ab′a′Glu-4 to Arg-115 Gly Ser Val-219 to Gly-46243250abb′a′cGlu-4 to Arg-115 Gly SerAla-120 to Leu-217 Gly Ser44530Val-219 to Lys-350 Gly Ser Val-352 to Leu-491The nomenclature adopted for the polypeptide constructs is based upon the domain structure established for human PDI but the sequence numbers refer to the rat PDI sequence.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Reactions with thioredoxin reductase were carried out essentially as described by Luthman and Holmgren (21Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained 0.3 mm insulin, 86 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3.3 mm EDTA, 0.7 mm NADPH and PDI or PDI domains in a final volume of 120 µl. The reaction was started by the addition of thioredoxin reductase to a final concentration of 9–30 nm. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of 0.5 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm DTNB, and the concentration of SH groups was determined at 412 nm. DNA sequences corresponding to different domains of PDI were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the rat PDI gene as template. All primers to the 5′ terminus of the domain sequence contained aBglII restriction site, and all primers to the 3′ terminus contained a BamHI restriction site. The PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (CLONTECH, Stockholm, Sweden). The strategy for combining DNA fragments together in an appropriate order is shown in Fig.1. The pGEM-T vector, carrying the DNA-encoding domain that was to be on the N terminus of the expressed protein, was excised with ApaI and BamHI, while the pGEM-T vector, harboring DNA fragment encoding the domain that was to be at the C terminus of the expressed protein, was excised withBglII and SalI. The fragments were gel-purified, mixed in equimolar amounts with pGEM-T vector previously digested withApaI and SalI. The mixture was incubated with T4 ligase (Promega) at 4 °C overnight and then used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α. Only domain combination linked head to tail will circularize the pGEM-T vector enabling the growth of DH5α in the presence of ampicillin. Such constructs generate proteins with a spacer of two amino acids, glycine and serine between the two domains. To produce full-length abb′a′c, the above procedure was repeated. The sequences of all individual domains were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing and found to be free of mutations. The appropriate linkage of combined domains was verified by diagnostic PCR. A vector for the expression of PDI domain and domain combinations (pET15rx) was constructed from pET15b (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene) was used to insert an extra nucleotide, A, into the XhoI site to place the BamHI site in-frame with the rest of the coding sequence. In addition, a stop codon, TAG, was added immediately after the BamHI site. The mutant plasmid was digested withNcoI and EcoRI, and the 390-bp fragment carrying the mutation was ligated back into the corresponding site of a pET15b previously cleaved with NcoI and EcoRI. The sequence of the 390 bp was confirmed by dideoxy sequence analysis. For expression of individual PDI domains and domain combinations, the constructed gene segment was excised from the pGEM-T vector byBglII-BamHI and cloned into pET15rx previously digested with BamHI. The expression plasmids containing theBglII-BamHI fragment in the proper orientation were identified by diagnostic PCR. Domain borders and presence of amino acid linker sequence in constructs are shown in Table I. Protein production was carried out in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), which also contained the pLysS plasmid to control leak-through expression. Cells transformed with the appropriate pET15rx vector were grown at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm and induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in ice-cold start buffer (pH 7.5, 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precharged with nickel and equilibrated with start buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of start buffer and then with 5 ml of elution buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Fractions of the eluate were analyzed on a 20% SDS-PAGE under reducing condition, and those containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA to remove the imidazole. Purified protein was concentrated by Diaflo (Amicon, Inc.) under N2. A PDI expression cassette was inserted into the plasmid pRS424 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid is a 2-µm-based multicopy yeast-bacterial shuttle vector with a TRP1 yeast-selectable marker. The pRS424 plasmid was digested withKpnI and SalI and a 780-bp fragment encoding the Gal1–10 promoter was inserted. This was followed by digestion with BclI and NotI and insertion of the 116-bp expression cassette fragment. This expression cassette containsBglII/BamHI sites that are in-frame with an N-terminal rat PDI signal sequence to direct the expressed protein to the ER and a C-terminal yeast ER-retention sequence (HDEL). PDI domains were PCR-amplified to contain a 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-BglII site to permit directional, in-frame insertion into the expression plasmid. The correct sequence of the entire cassette including the PDI insert was verified by dideoxy sequencing. The viability of the yeast strain YPH274 with the chromosomal copy of the PDI1gene disrupted by deletion is maintained by an episomal plasmid, pCT37, that expresses wild-type yeast PDI and contains a URA3 selection marker. This strain is not viable on media containing 5-FOA, a compound that is toxic to cells expressing the URA3 gene (15Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). After transformation with a plasmid containing the PDI or its domains, colonies were grown on minimal medium with all amino acids except tryptophan (TRP selection media) and in the presence of galactose to induce PDI expression. Several individual colonies that survived this selection were streaked onto 5-FOA (1 mg/ml 5-FOA) plates in TRP selection media that contained galactose. Only cells containing a galactose-inducible activity that provide the essential activity of PDI are able to lose pCT37 plasmid and grow on 5-FOA-containing plates. The transformed cells were selected on plates without tryptophan, then induced with galactose and replated on plates containing 5-FOA. Individual colonies were picked and cultured overnight in liquid media. An equal number of cells (approximated by absorbance at 600 nm) were diluted into fresh media and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured at different time intervals. Individual catalytic domains of PDI (a anda′) and various domain combinations were constructed using a systematic genetic engineering approach that allows the directed combination of any of the PDI domains in any order. We have combined such domains in a controlled manner, but the same principle could be used to randomly reorganize DNA pieces. The system involves bordering each domain construct with in-frame BglII/BamHI sites and then linking two domains in a directed fashion that creates a hybrid BglII/BamHI site at the fusion of the domains but leaves a BamHI site in the C-terminal domain and a BglII site in N-terminal domain. Repeating this cycle of cleavage/ligation enables the combination of any of the PDI domains in a directed fashion. The in-frame, hybridBglII/BamHI site at the domain junctions inserts six extra nucleotides, GGATCT, resulting in a glycine-serine linker between domains when the protein is expressed. Domain boundaries were based on the experiments of Darby and Creighton (10Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) who used a combination of expression and proteolysis to accurately establish the structural domains. In addition to those individual domains and domain constructs that have been reported previously (a,a′, ab, b′a′ and b′a′c (11Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and abc, a′c (13Sun X. Dai Y. Liu H. Chen S. Wang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), we also produced several new, multidomain constructs, aba′, ab′a′, andaa′ as well as the reconstruction of the entire molecule with the substitution of Gly-Ser in the linker region(abb′a′c) (TableI ). The validity of the method is demonstrated by the similar activity of the reassembeled PDI,abb′a′c (nPDI), compared with that of wtPDI (see below). Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using a N-terminal His6 tag (Table I). Each of the proteins could be isolated in a soluble and sufficiently pure form to characterize their catalytic properties. Fig.2shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified single and multidomain PDI constructs used in this study. For each of the constructs, the activity was measured for catalysis of disulfide bond isomerization during the refolding of reduced, denatured RNase. Native disulfide formation was followed as the rate of hydrolysis of 2′,3′cCMP catalyzed by the native RNase that is formed (20Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Darby and Creighton failed to detect isomerase activity of the individual a anda′ domains with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor as the substrate (23Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although, the activity with RNase refolding is low, it is real and measurable over background isomerization at a concentration of 5 µm active sites. Low but significant isomerase activities could be measured for all of the constructs including those with multiple domains and P34H thioredoxin, a mutant thioredoxin with a PDI-like active site sequence (24Krause G. Lundström J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of the various domain combinations that were examined are shown in Fig. 3. The b′a′cconstruct is the only domain combination with high isomerization activity. At increasing concentrations of reduced RNase, the reaction reaches saturation at 30 µm (data not shown), which is similar to the behavior of a 21-kDa C-terminal PDI fragment (25Puig A. Primm T.P. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Ballard K.D. Orkiszewski R.S. Makarov V. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reconstructed PDI molecule in which the natural linker between the domains has been replaced by Gly-Ser (abb′a′c) has the same activity as wtPDI. PDI is a substrate for mammalian thioredoxin reductasein vitro and will replace thioredoxin in the NADPH-dependent reduction of the disulfides of insulin (5Lundström J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay depends on interactions between thioredoxin reductase and PDI so that high activity can be used to verify that the domain constructs have wild-type active site conformations (Fig.4). The K m andk cat values were determined using 9 or 15 nm thioredoxin reductase and are summarized in TableII. The formation of SH groups of insulin in the presence of thioredoxin reductase is the result of two serial reactions: the reduction of PDI by thioredoxin reductase, and the reduction of insulin by PDI. Because the rate of the reaction was dependent on the thioredoxin reductase concentration, the reduction of PDI by thioredoxin reductase is rate-limiting. Thus, the apparentK m and k cat values in TableII reflect interactions with thioredoxin reductase and structural similarity to thioredoxin. All of the constructs with an aor a′ domain have activity that is very similar to wtPDI. All constructs involving the a domains have higher catalytic activity than PDI, suggesting that the a domain may be partially shielded when it is a part of a whole PDI molecule or that the presence of other domains may inhibit the binding to thioredoxin reductase.Table IIThe activities of PDI individual domains and domain combinations with thioredoxin reductaseK mk catk cat/K mµmmin−12-a9 nm thioredoxin reductase was used.PDIa13.9 ± 1.43000215.8PDIa′29.6 ± 1.7770262-a9 nm thioredoxin reductase was used.PDIab9.7 ± 2.21900195.9PDIb′a′60.5 ± 8.067011.1PDIb′a′c77.6 ± 10.2110014.2PDI13.3 ± 1.61400105.32-bReconstructed PDI in which the natural linker between the domains has been replaced by Gly-Ser.PDIabb′a′c13 ± 2.580062K m and K cat were determined by fitting the experimental data using nonlinear least squares fitting to the equation of a rectangular hyperbola.2-a 9 nm thioredoxin reductase was used.2-b Reconstructed PDI in which the natural linker between the domains has been replaced by Gly-Ser. Open table in a new tab K m and K cat were determined by fitting the experimental data using nonlinear least squares fitting to the equation of a rectangular hyperbola. The a domain and its extended form, ab, both haveK m values for thioredoxin reductase that are similar to PDI, but the a′, b′a′, and b′a′chave K m values that are 2.1, 4.7, and 6.0-fold greater than PDI, respectively. The turnover number of a is around 3000 min−1 and close to thek cat of rat liver thioredoxin reductase with thioredoxin (21Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). This is 2-fold higher than the turnover for intact PDI (1400 × min−1) and 4-fold higher than the turnover number of the recombined PDI molecule, abb′a′c. Thek cat for a′ reveals substantial activity (55%) when compared directly to the intact PDI. Full-length rat PDI is very efficient in rescuing yeast cells with a deleted PDI gene. PDI mutants with undetectable (<5%) oxidase activity (9Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) are capable of complementing the lethal null mutation, leading to the conclusion that the isomerase activity is the essential function of PDI in vivo (26Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 431-437PubMed Google Scholar). However, the converse experiment has not been performed with PDI species that have significant oxidase activity but low isomerase activity. Given the very low isomerase activity of the individual a and a′domains, it is surprising to find that these isolated domains provide sufficient activity to support viability when overexpressed. Control experiments show that all tested strains grow on Trp-deficient medium (Fig. 5), but only wtPDI, a,and a′ support growth on 5-FOA medium. The vector alone or the vector containing inserts of b orb′ fail to grow when the plasmid-expressing yeast PDI is selected against in 5-FOA medium. PDI and the a and a′ domains are overexpressed under the control of a galactose-dependent promoter (Gal1–10) that can be repressed with increasing concentrations of glucose. The concentration of glucose that is required to inhibit cell growth is almost identical for wild-type PDI and the aand a′ domains (Fig. 6), suggesting that a comparable activity of Gal1–10 promoter is needed to supply the proper amounts of either wtPDI or the a anda′ domains. Single copy plasmids yield the same results; thea and a′ domains alone provide all of the essential activity of wtPDI and support wild-type growth rates. PDI is thought to have evolved via duplications of genes encoding structures similar to thioredoxin. An overall structure with repetitions of thioredoxin domains is also present in several PDI homologues (27Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). It is clear that the multidomain structure of PDI is essential for substrate binding and for high isomerase activity. In this study, except for the b′-a′-c construct, all of the new PDI constructs with one or two domains have less than 10% the activity of the wild-type protein similar to the thioredoxin variant P34H Trx. Thus, the presence of one or two domains is not sufficient to generate high isomerase activity in vitro. In contrast, the same constructs have activities similar to PDI or higher in reactions with thioredoxin reductase and insulin, suggesting that they are folded and have reactive active sites. The b′a′c construct is the only one with significant isomerase activity. In fact, the isomerase activity of theb′a′c fragment is equivalent to that observed with a full-length PDI in which the N-terminal active site is inactivated by mutation (Fig. 3), suggesting that the a′ active site must function locally and derive little from the presence of thea and b domains. By contrast, the aand b domains rely heavily on the C-terminal portion of the molecule. The activity of a full-length mutant, abb′a′c in which the a′ active site has been inactivated by mutation is considerably higher than that of the constructs ab orabc. The assistance to the a domain is derived principally from the b′ and c domains becauseaba′, ab′a′ and abc all have low activity. The b′ domain is thought to contain a peptide/protein binding site; however, other sites may contribute to the binding of larger unfolded protein substrates (11Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that theb′ domain by itself provides insufficient substrate interactions to support high isomerase activity because the constructsb′a′ and ab′a′ have low activity. Puig et al. reported that “weePDI” (residues 307–491) has 16% of wild-type PDI isomerase activity (25Puig A. Primm T.P. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Ballard K.D. Orkiszewski R.S. Makarov V. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Ourb′a′c construct (residues 219–491) is based on boundaries defined structurally by Darby (3Darby N.J. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10517-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The difference compared with weePDI is 88 amino acids. Thus the N-terminal portion of the b′domains is important for activity. This importance is further supported by data published by Sun et al. (13Sun X. Dai Y. Liu H. Chen S. Wang C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) who reported that the isomerase activity of b′a′c with a deletion of 33 residues at the N terminus of b′ domain (residue 248–419) is 6% of wild type. Although, their b′a′c construct is less truncated compared with weePDI, it displays weaker isomerase activity. The possible discrepancy may be explained by the difference in method and substrate used to measure activity. Constructs lacking the c domain (b′a′,ab′a′) also have lower isomerase activity. This is somewhat surprising because the c domain in wtPDI has been reported to contribute insignificantly to the isomerase activity of PDI (28Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At least for RNase as a substrate, the acidic c region contributes substantially to substrate interactions in truncated PDI variants. Because the a-b-b′a′ construct has wild-type activity, the interactions with c that are important to the activity of b′a′c must be replaced by other interactions that are available in the a and b domains. It is clear that the ability of various PDI domains to contribute to high isomerase activity is a function of context rather than the property of any individual domain. The multidomain structure of PDI is important to the ability of the molecule to provide high isomerase activity in vitro. Surprisingly, this conclusion does not extend to the molecule in vivo. Because pdi1Δ yeast transfected with either thea or a′ domain grow at rates that are comparable with strains transfected with the wild-type PDI, most of the PDI structure is dispensable for fulfilling its essential function at least in S. cerevisiae under conditions of laboratory culture. It is unlikely that the amounts of a and a′ that are expressed greatly exceed the amount of wtPDI because all are repressed at approximately the same level of glucose. If a higher expression level of one of the constructs were required to support growth, growth inhibition would be expected at lower concentration of glucose (Fig.6). Thus, the a and a′ domains with only 3–4% of the isomerase activity of wtPDI can provide the essential function(s) of PDI and support wild-type growth rates. Except for full-length wtPDI with at least one intact active site, no other PDI variants support normal growth rates (29Holst B. Tachibana C. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chivers et al.found that the thioredoxin variant P34H Trx, which has similar isomerase activity as the a or a′, would rescue the PDI-null mutation; however, the growth rate is significantly below wild-type (30Chivers P.T. Laboissiere M.C. Raines R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2659-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PDI is a very abundant ER protein; its concentration in the ER is estimated at 0.2–0.5 mm (31Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J. Freedman R.B. Proteins. 1992; 14: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PDI with no active site cysteines and no redox-related activity will not complement the deletion of the yeast PDI1 gene (15Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) showing that a redox function of PDI is required. If only a small fraction (<5%) of the isomerase activity is necessary for wild-type growth, the requirement for high ER concentration of PDI is likely to be related to the capacity of the oxidative pathway where electrons are passed from substrate protein thiols via PDI to the protein ERO1 (17Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Both a anda′ are as active as wtPDI in incorporating a disulfide bond into a model peptide corresponding to a natural disulfide in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (10Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), implying that aand a′ could fulfill the substrate oxidase requirements in the ER. That a and a′ support wild-type growth rates also suggests that they can be oxidized by ERO1 at a rate that is sufficiently high to meet the oxidative requirements encountered in protein secretion. Reoxidation of PDI by ERO1 seems to be a kinetically efficient reaction because all of the PDI is in the oxidized form when trapped in vivo with thiolalkylating agents (17Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This would promote fast incorporation of disulfide bonds and might be equally well fulfilled by individual a or a′ domain as by wtPDI. However, because isomerization requires a reduced PDI active site (9Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), extensive oxidation of a or a′ would decrease the available isomerase activity in vivo even more. It has been shown that cellular glutathione does not play a direct role in protein disulfide bond formation but contributes net reducing equivalents to the ER (32Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These reducing equivalents might reduce oxidized PDI to the dithiol state thus regenerating its isomerase activity. The low (<5%)in vitro activities of a and a′ were measured under optimal redox conditions where PDI is present in nearly equal proportions of oxidized and reduced active sites. How thein vivo requirements for isomerase and oxidase activities are balanced with the amount of PDI protein and the redox states of the PDI active sites will require further experiments."

The biological functions of the FACITs are not yet fully understood. Rapid and reversible production of collagen XII by fibroblasts submitted to mechanical stress has been observed (10Chiquet M. Matthisson M. Koch M. Tannheimer M. Chiquet- Ehrismann R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Trachslin J. Koch M. Chiquet M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 247: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Collagens XII and XIV potentially facilitate the contraction of collagen gels by fibroblasts (12Nishiyama T. McDonough A.M. Bruns R.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28193-28199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they are known to interact with other components of the extracellular matrix (13Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D.

This suggests that they contribute to the cohesion and the modulation of the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. Collagen XIV is also a potential reservoir for procollagen N-proteinase (16Colige A. Beschin A. Samyn B. Goebels Y. Van Beeumen J. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16724-16730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and promotes the adhesion of different cells (17Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Lampe B. Schuppan D.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The assembly of fibril-forming collagens (collagen types I, II, III, V, and XI) is a complex process in which three chains must fold into a triple-helix. This results from chain association, nucleation, and propagation of the folding occurring from the C to N termini in a zipper-like fashion (19Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The C-terminal non-triple-helical domains, called the C-propeptides, play an important role in the initial steps of chain association (21Bachinger H.P. Davis J.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P.

Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, in the case of FACITs, the C-propeptides are replaced by significantly shorter non-triple-helical domains, NC1. These small domains consist of just about 75 amino acids for collagen XII and less than 30 amino acids for collagen IX, whereas the C-propeptides of the fibrillar collagens contain some 260 amino acids. The NC1 domains of the FACITs do not share common sequences. In addition, structural variations in the NC1 domains of rat and mouse collagen XII, generated by tissue-specific alternative splicing, have been shown (25Kania A.M. Reichenberger E. Baur S.T. Karimbux N.Y. Taylor R.W. Olsen B.R. Nishimura I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22053-22059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, FACITs display remarkable similarities in their COL1 domains with respect to their similar size and to two corresponding imperfections within the triple-helix. At the junction of the COL1 and NC1 domains, two cysteines separated by four amino acids are responsible for interchain disulfide bonding. These data suggest that the COL1 domain and the junction may serve a common function in all FACITs.The critical role of the COL1 domain in the assembly of the collagen XII molecule has first been suggested by the necessity to stabilize this domain by the hydroxylation of prolyl residues to obtain disulfide-bonded trimers. Indeed, reduction or inhibition of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) prevented the formation of disulfide-bonded trimers in HeLa and insect cells, which produced a chicken minicollagen XII consisting of the C-terminal domains COL1 and NC1 (26Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mazzorana M. Snellman A. Kivirikko K.I. van der Rest M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29003-29008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, a deletion covering most of the NC1 domain of chicken collagen XII, except for seven residues of the COL1/NC1 junction, does not prevent the formation of disulfide-bonded trimers correctly folded into a triple-helix (28Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this report, we analyze the respective roles of the COL1 domain and of the junction in the formation of the homotrimeric collagen XII molecule. We show that the formation of the COL1 triple-helix is the key step of the trimeric association of the α chains of minicollagen XII, which is then stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHiTrap Q, HiTrap SP, and Superose 6 and 12 (HR 10/30) columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Recombinant baculovirus transfer vector constructs coding for chicken minicollagen XII with shortened COL1 domains were generated by PCR overlap extension using pRc/CMV COL XII 23 as a template (28Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). PVL-XII-PCR1 was generated using a 5′-oligonucleotide primer H1 (5′-GCAGTCCTCGAGGGCTCCACAGGATCACGAGG-3′) complementary to the sequence downstream of the second imperfection of the COL1 domain (an XhoI site has been introduced in this oligonucleotide to facilitate subsequent subcloning) and a 3′-oligonucleotide primer H2 (5′-AGGCACAGTCGAGGC-3′) complementary to the sequence of the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) located 50 nucleotides downstream of theXbaI site of the polylinker. PCR yielded a 415-bp fragment (PCR1), which was cut by XhoI and XbaI and subcloned in BKS ENS 23 (28) digested by the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid BKS XII-PCR1 contains also the signal peptide of the α1 chain of human collagen I and two tagging sequences, each consisting of a short fragment of human c-Myc protein. BKS XII-PCR1 is digested by HindIII and XbaI, and the resulting fragment is then cloned in the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV, giving rise to pRc/CMV XII-PCR1. Concurrently, BKS XII-PCR1 and the baculovirus transfer vector pVL 1392 (PharMingen) are linearized by HindIII and NotI, respectively, and filled with Klenow. Both are then digested with XbaI. TheHindIII-filled/XbaI fragment of BKS XII-PCR1 is then ligated to pVL 1392 containing a NotI-filled extremity and a cohesive XbaI extremity. pVL XII-PCR2 has been prepared in the same way using a 5′-oligonucleotide primer I (5′-GCAGTCCTCGAGGGAAATGCGGGTATTCG-3′) complementary to the sequence coding for the last 15 amino acids of COL1 and H2 as 3′-oligonucleotide primer. The PCR2 fragment was 363 bp in size. In the final baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1392, the minigenes of interest are inserted downstream of the polyhedrin promoter. In view of homologous recombination, each of the two recombinant pVL constructs has been co-transfected into Spodoptera frugiperdaSf9 cells together with wild type-purified DNA ofAutographa californica polyhedrosis virus. The resultant viral pool was collected, amplified, and plaque-purified to screen for recombinant viruses (29Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agric. Exp. Station Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-57Google Scholar). After several rounds of purification, the ensuing recombinant viruses, called XII-PCR1 and XII-PCR2, were checked by a PCR-based method (30Malitschek B. Schartl M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 177-178PubMed Google Scholar), amplified, and stored at 4 °C in the dark until use.Infection of Insect Cells with Recombinant BaculovirusesTrichoplusia ni Tn-SB1-4 cells (marketed by Invitrogen as High Five cells) were infected with COL XII 23, XII-PCR1, or XII-PCR2 viruses together with recombinant viruses encoding the α and β subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (31Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These viruses were a generous gift from Prof. Taı̈na Pihlajaniemi, University of Oulu, Finland. Cells were cultured at 27 °C in serum-free medium containing 0.1% pluronic acid, penicillin, and streptomycin. For cells cultured in plates, 6 × 106 cells were seeded per 100-mm culture dish. For cells cultured in suspension in a spinner system (Cell Spin, Integra Biosciences), 100 ml of medium was inoculated with 108 cells in a 250-ml spinner flask to ensure proper aeration and stirred continuously at 40 rpm until the cells were adapted to suspension culture conditions. Cells were maintained at 106 cells/ml by removing the excess of cell suspension and replacing it with fresh culture medium. They were infected when they had reached 98% viability and 18- to 24-h doubling time. In both culture conditions, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection 5:1:1 for the recombinant baculoviruses coding for any one of the minicollagens, the α subunit, and the β subunit of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase, respectively. Sodium ascorbate was added daily at 50 µg/ml immediately after the replacement of the viral inocula with fresh medium (7 ml) for cells cultured in plates or 1 h after inoculation of the viruses for the cells cultured in suspension. Cells and media were collected 48 h after infection. Cell fractions were used either immediately or stored as pellets at −80 °C after freezing in liquid nitrogen. Media were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C after addition of protease inhibitors (10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NEM, and 1 mm PMSF) and frozen at −80 °C.Transient Transfection of HeLa CellsCells (106) were plated in 100-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. After cell adhesion and spreading, 5 µg of expression vector pRc/CMV XII-PCR1 and 10 µg of plasmid carrier DNA were used to transfect the cells using the calcium-phosphate procedure (32Kriegler M. Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual. Stockton Press, NY1990Crossref Google Scholar). After 16 h of contact with the DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitate, cells were rinsed and sodium ascorbate (50 µg/ml) was added in 7 ml of fresh medium. After 24 h, medium and cells were collected for immunodetection experiments.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting AnalysisThe cells cultured in plates were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNEM, and 1 mm PMSF, 300 µl/106 cells). Aliquots of homogenates or cell extracts and of the corresponding conditioned media were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with antibody Myc-9E10.2 (designated here as 9E10). This antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the tagging sequences derived from the human c-Myc protein present at the N terminus of minicollagen XII constructs.Purification of Minicollagen XII from Medium of Infected Insect Cells Cultured in SuspensionConditioned medium containing protease inhibitors was chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose. After rinsing of the gel with 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NEM, elution of minicollagen XII was performed with the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Minicollagen XII was further purified with an anion exchange fast-protein liquid chromatography column (HiTrap Q, 5 ml) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mNaCl and 5 mm EDTA. A linear gradient of 0.1 to 0.7m NaCl in 50 min was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. In this gradient, species that migrate as single bands with an apparent molecular mass corresponding to monomers in SDS-gels elute earlier than trimers. These fractions were separately injected to a Superose 6 fast-protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated in 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 0.4 ml/min. This gel filtration allows preparation of two fractions corresponding to trimers and monomers, which elute after 12 and 16 ml, respectively.Pepsin Digestion of Minicollagen XIIMinicollagen XII (about 700 µg) purified from the medium of infected insect cells cultured in suspension as described above (except that the gel-filtration step was omitted) was adjusted to pH 3 with acetic acid and incubated in the presence of pepsin (20 µg) for 18 h at 4 °C. Fresh pepsin was added (30 µg), and after 90 min at 20 °C digested minicollagen XII was purified by gel filtration on Superose 6.Purification of XII-PCR1 and XII-PCR2 from Insect Cell ExtractsXII-PCR1Infected High Five cells were homogenized (3.4 × 106 cells/ml) in cold extraction buffer (0.2m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NEM, and 1 mm PMSF). After 30-min incubation on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The extract was diluted 2-fold with extraction buffer lacking NaCl and chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in 0.1m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NEM, pH 7.4. Elution was performed by raising the NaCl concentration to 0.5 m. XII-PCR1 was further purified by HiTrap Q chromatography (a 100-min linear gradient of 0.1 to 0.5m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 1 ml/min) followed by gel filtration on Superose 6 performed as described for minicollagen XII.XII-PCR2Infected High Five cells were homogenized, and the extract was subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described for XII-PCR1. Monomers elute in the flow-through, whereas dimers elute with the 0.5 m NaCl-containing buffer. Monomers were further purified by HiTrap Q chromatography using a 0.1 to 0.3 mNaCl gradient. For the analysis of the XII-PCR2 hydroxylation state, an additional reverse phase chromatography on C18 was performed before trypsin digestion.Trypsin/Chymotrypsin DigestionsThe fractions (3–6 µg) equilibrated for 5 min at the digestion temperature were incubated 3 min at 21 °C unless otherwise indicated in the presence of a mixture of trypsin (1–1.5 µg) and chymotrypsin (3–4.5 µg).Purification of the COL1 Domain of Minicollagen XIIAn extract corresponding to 25 × 106 infected insect cells cultured in plates was adjusted to pH 2–2.5 with HCl before digestion with 1.5 mg of pepsin for 2 h at 20 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 12000 × g, the supernatant was neutralized with NaOH, filtered, and applied to a HiTrap Q column. The unbound fraction was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.1, and batch-incubated with CM-cellulose. Pepsinized minicollagen was eluted with 0.15m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and chromatographed on Superose 6 as described for the full-length minicollagen XII. An aliquot of pepsinized minicollagen XII (0.4 mg) was further digested using a mixture of trypsin (20 µg) and chymotrypsin (50 µg) for 15 min at 25 °C and then 30 min at 20 °C. The digest was injected to a HiTrap sulfopropyl column, and the trimeric disulfide-bonded COL1 domain was eluted using a 0 to 0.25m NaCl gradient in Bis-Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.7. Further purification was achieved by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column equilibrated in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 0.4 ml/min.Labeling of Cysteine Residues with MPBIsolated T, Mt, and Mm forms of minicollagen XII (0.1 mg/ml) were reacted with 120 µm MPB for 35 min at 30 °C either directly or after incubation for 15 min at 45 °C in the presence of 5 mm DTT followed by removal of DTT by reverse phase chromatography. The MPB labeling was stopped by addition of reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Aliquots (0.1 µg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting. MPB-modified proteins were detected after incubation with avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (ExtrAvidin, Sigma) using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Bio-Rad).Analysis of XII-PCR2 Hydroxylation StateXII-PCR2 (120 µg) in 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, was incubated 20 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 µg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega). The digest was chromatographed on a C18 reverse phase column (Supelcosyl LC-318, 25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, Supelco) using an aqueous acetonitrile gradient (0–45%) over 60 min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1.2 ml/min. An aliquot of each peak was tested by a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for its recognition by a monoclonal antibody (17-8H11) whose epitope is located within the 22 first residues of the NC1 domain of chicken collagen XII. 2M.

Summer K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (5–200 µl) were assayed for GSSG in a final volume of 1 ml of a 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl buffer (pH 8) containing 0.2 mm NADPH by addition of 0.6 unit of yeast glutathione reductase (120 units/ml) and monitoring the absorbance decrease at 340 nm. NADPH consumption was quantified using an extinction coefficient of 6.34 mm−1cm−1.Other ProceduresSDS-PAGE analysis was performed according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. Alternatively, the procedure of Schägger and von Jagow (35Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10434) Google Scholar) was used. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer using the trifluoroacetic acid conversion program provided by the manufacturer. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on an electrospray apparatus API 165 Sciex (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an ion spray source.DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported here demonstrate that the COL1 domain is the key element in the assembly of minicollagen XII. The characterization of recombinant minicollagen XII produced in insect cells cultured in suspension shows the presence of a mixture of correctly folded trimers in which the cysteines of the COL1/NC1 junction are inter- or intrachain-linked. Their trimeric, triple-helical structure, with the three chains in register, has been demonstrated. The intrachain bonds rearrange to form interchain disulfide bonds under reducing conditions, providing that the triple-helix is maintained. In contrast, the disruption of the triple-helix prevents the intra- to interchain bond rearrangement.In vitro reassociation studies of monomers of minicollagen XII or of its COL1 domain show that the triple-helix forms to the same degree independent of whether the redox state of the cysteines is involved in intrachain disulfide bonds or totally reduced.These results show that interchain disulfide bond formation is not a prerequisite for the association of the α chains, nucleation, and folding of the collagen XII molecules in trimers with a triple-helical COL1 domain. They are similar to those previously described for the fibrillar collagen III (38Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and are in favor of a mechanism in which the collagenous part has first to fold into a triple-helical conformation before interchain disulfide bond formation occurs. Because the triple-helix formation is the rate-limiting step, when the redox conditions are too oxidative, the cysteines of monomers form intrachain disulfide bonds. In this respect, the COL1/NC1 junction of collagen XII produced in cells cultured in suspension shows the same behavior as a synthetic peptide containing the COL1/NC1 junction of collagen XIV, (GPO)3GYCDPSSCAG, in reassociation studies. Indeed, air oxidation of this peptide mainly leads to formation of an intrachain disulfide bond (36Lesage A. Penin F. Geourjon C. Marion D.,. van der Rest M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9647-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This could explain why, in the case of minicollagen XII produced in insect cells cultured in suspension, significant amounts of non-disulfide-bonded trimers are observed. However, when the redox conditions are less oxidative (cells cultured in plates), interchain disulfide bonding occurs as soon as the triple-helix has formed, because very few non-disulfide-bonded trimers are observed.3 In vitro reassociation data also show that the COL1 domain and the COL1/NC1 junction contain all the information necessary for trimerization of minicollagen XII and nucleation of its triple-helix. These results confirm those previously obtained in HeLa cells transfected with a minigene of collagen XII coding only for the COL1 domain and the COL1/NC1 junction, which showed that triple-helical disulfide-bonded trimers were produced (28Mazzorana M. Giry-Lozinguez C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).To determine the respective roles of COL1 and of the junction in assembly, two shortened minicollagens XII, XII-PCR1 and XII-PCR2, constituted of the complete NC1 domain and of a COL1 domain reduced to its one-third or one-sixth C-terminal extremity, respectively, have been produced in insect cells. We show that the presence of one-third of the COL1 domain is sufficient to promote the formation of interchain disulfide-bonded trimers in which the ten remaining GXY triplets of COL1 have folded into a triple-helix. This result is also true at 37 °C, as shown by transfection experiments in HeLa cells. In contrast, XII-PCR2 does not form trimers neither disulfide-bonded nor non-disulfide-bonded. Because XII-PCR2 still contains the five C-terminal GXY triplets of COL1, a difference in reactivity of the cysteines of the junction due to a different environment is unlikely. Neither the hydroxylation state of the two prolyl residues in the Y position of the two remaining GPP triplets nor the redox state of the cysteines is responsible for the inability of the α chains of XII-PCR2 to associate into trimers, because we have shown that the two prolyl residues are hydroxylated and that the cysteines are mainly reduced. These results show that the COL1/NC1 junction is not sufficient to promote the association of the three chains, and that COL1, or a part of it, is required to ensure trimerization. A similar conclusion has emerged from studies using synthetic peptides corresponding to the NC1 sequences of collagen IX (39Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or to the sequence of the COL1/NC1 junction of collagen XIV (36Lesage A. Penin F. Geourjon C. Marion D.,. van der Rest M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9647-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sequence of COL1 is crucial for the trimeric assembly of minicollagen XII. Taking into account the natural tendency of the GXY triplets to fold into a triple-helix, it is tempting to speculate that the nucleation of the helix is the driving force for the assembly process. In this case, the collagenous part of XII-PCR2 is probably too short to form a stable triple-helix. Indeed, the thermal stability of triple-helices has been reported for (GPO)npeptides of various lengths and the melting temper"
https://openalex.org/W2005974099,"During its first ≃100,000 years, the universe was a fully ionized plasma with a tight coupling by Thompson scattering between the photons and matter. The trade-off between gravitational collapse and photon pressure causes acoustic oscillations in this primordial fluid. These oscillations will leave predictable imprints in the spectra of the cosmic microwave background and the present-day matter-density distribution. Recently, the BOOMERANG and MAXIMA teams announced the detection of these acoustic oscillations in the cosmic microwave background (observed at redshift ≃ 1000). Here, we compare these CMB detections with the corresponding acoustic oscillations in the matter-density power spectrum (observed at redshift ≃ 0.1).

This protein, which we termed ShIF, was isolated based on its ability to support proliferation of a mutant clone S21, which was established from Ba/F3 cells that are usually interleukin-3-dependent but became dependent on a stroma cell line ST2 after chemical mutagenesis. ISF, a membrane protein harboring six transmembrane domains, was reported to have immunosuppressive functions. The coding region of ShIF started from the third transmembrane domain of ISF. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that ShIF was expressed in both the secreted and membrane-bound forms of 27-kDa protein, which was supposed to have an internal ATG present in the third transmembrane domain of ISF as a start codon. In addition to the full-length form of ISF, a major protein with a molecular size of 27 kDa was also expressed through the proteolytic process of ISF. ShIF resembles this naturally occurring short form of ISF (sISF). Deletion analysis of the major domains of ISF cDNA revealed that ShIF is an active functional domain of ISF with a capability to support proliferation of S21 cells. Enforced expression of ShIF in MS10 cells, bone marrow stroma cells that do not express endogenous ShIF or ISF, conferred on the cells an ability to support the growth of S21 cells as well as bone marrow cells. Interestingly, ShIF shows a high sequence homology to the C-terminal part of a 95-kDa yeast vacuolar H (+)-ATPase subunit, Vph1p (39%), and a 116-kDa proton pump (VPP1) (54%) of the rat and bovine synaptic vesicle. Therefore, it is possible that ShIF also acts as a proton pump and somehow prevents the cells from undergoing apoptosis.

Genetics. 1991; 129: 975-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), programmed cell death in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (2Metzstein M.M. Stanfield G.M. Horvitz H.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and embryonic pattern formation in the fly,Drosophila melanogaster (3Nusslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (3015) Google Scholar). Such screening uses a three-step procedure that entails: first, random mutagenesis of a large number of organisms; second, screening of the resulting mutants to identify those with a defect in the process of interest; and finally, identification of the mutations in specific genes that underlie the resultant phenotypes of interest. Thus, because of the ability of mutations to alter the function of a single product, the forward genetic screening is a powerful method in the identification of genes that regulate biological processes within the context of a complex cellular environment. We exploited this concept in a novel strategy to search for stroma-derived growth factors. The critical roles of bone marrow stroma cells in inducing proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells are well recognized, and many stroma-derived growth factors have been identified and proved to play critical roles in hematopoiesis (4Kincade P.W. Lee G. Pietrangeli C.E. Hayashi S. Gimble J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 111-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Dorshkind K. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 4088-4095PubMed Google Scholar). To search for unidentified stroma-derived factors, we designed a strategy in which a genetic approach was combined with retrovirus-mediated expression screening. We chemically mutagenized an interleukin-3 (IL-3)1-dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3, which does not proliferate on most stromal cell lines, and isolated mutant clones that were stroma cell-dependent. These mutant cells were then used as indicator cells in retrovirus-mediated expression cloning of stroma-derived factors that support the growth of the mutant Ba/F3 cells. One of the Ba/F3 mutants, S21, was able to grow on stromal cell line ST2 but not on MS10 cells. The introduction of a ST2-derived cDNA library into MS10 cells yielded identification of a cDNA having a product that supported the growth of S21 but not the parent Ba/F3 cells. This cDNA contained a putative open reading frame of 263 amino acids, a peptide named ShIF, which turned out to be the C-terminal part of a known protein, ISF (immune suppressor factor) (8Lee C. Ghoshal K. Beaman K.D. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ShIF cDNA expressed both soluble and membrane-bound forms of 27-kDa proteins, and deletion analysis of ISF revealed that ShIF corresponded to a functional domain of the full-length ISF protein. The findings of this paper suggest that ShIF, identified in this study, corresponds to a naturally occurring short form of ISF. Its growth-supporting activities on S21 cells as well as on bone marrow hematopoietic cells further suggest that ShIF is a growth stimulatory peptide involved in the regulation of cell growth. Recombinant murine (m)IL-3 was purified (9Miyajima A. Otsu K. Schreurs J. Bond M.W. Abrams J.S. Arai K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine GM-CSF, mIL-5, and mSCF, and neutralizing antibodies (anti-macrophage-CSF, anti-SCF, and anti-IL-1) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). An anti-FLAG BioM2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. A retrovirus packaging cell line, BOSC23, for ecotropic retroviruses (10Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (DMEM-10% FCS) and guanine phosphoribosyltransferase selection reagents (GPT; Specialty Media, Lavelette, NJ). The cells were transferred into DMEM-10% FCS without GPT selection reagents 2 days before transfection. A murine pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS in the presence of 1 ng/ml mIL-3. The mouse bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines ST2, PA6, and CF-1 were cultured in DMEM-F-12 containing 10% FCS. MS10, another mouse bone marrow-derived stroma, was cultured in minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FCS. COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM-10% FCS. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) was purchased from Sigma. The following protease inhibitors were also purchased from Sigma:p-aminobenzoyl-Gly-Pro-d-Leu-d-Ala-hydroxamic acid, captopril, bestatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and bacitracin. All of the protease inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO as 10 mm stock solutions. Ba/F3 cells (1 × 107) were chemically mutagenized with EMS at 10 µm for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To determine an appropriate dose and duration of EMS treatment, we constructed a dose-response curve over a time course period and monitored the percentage of surviving cells after a 24-h recovery period. The above chosen conditions resulted in the survival of 10–20% of the cells. After 2 h of EMS treatment, the cells were recovered by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min) and washed once with medium to remove residual EMS. The mutagenized cells were resuspended in a culture medium, allowed to recover for 24 h in the presence of mIL-3, collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min), and resuspended in DMEM-F-12–10% FCS before seeding on stroma cell layers. ST2 cells (5 × 106) were cultured in 100-mm plates and grown to confluence. Mutated BaF3 cells were seeded at 1 × 106cells/plate, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the absence of mIL-3. The medium was changed every 4 or 5 days. Only half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium, gently so as not to detach the cells from the stromal cells. Nonmutated cells were also cocultured with the stroma as a control. Colonies of mutant cells that proliferated on the stroma were isolated using cylindrical rings followed by trypsin-EDTA treatment and in some cases through direct pipetting using a thin tip. Individual clones were obtained by limiting dilution in 96-well plates, and 48 clones were isolated. All 48 clones were recultured on ST2 cells to confirm stroma-dependent proliferation of each clone, and clones in which proliferation was not inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to known cytokines were chosen for further analysis. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from a mouse bone marrow stroma cell line, ST2, using FASTTRACK (Invitrogen). A cDNA library was constructed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript Plasmid System, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with some modifications (11Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT) primer. BstXI adapters (Invitrogen) were added to the cDNAs for bidirectional cloning, which was then size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Complementary DNAs larger than 1.0 kilobase pair were cloned into theBstXI sites of a retroviral vector pMX (13Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). The ligation mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli DH10B by electroporation using the GenePulser electroporation apparatus (Bio-Rad). The cDNA library contained 4.1 × 107independent clones. BOSC23 cells (2 × 106) were seeded in 6-cm plates a day before transfection. DNAs derived from the subdivided library of ST2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate a high titer retrovirus stock. After 2 days, the culture supernatant was used to infect MS10 cells, which did not support the growth of S21 mutants. About 1 × 104MS10 cells/well were seeded into 24-well plates the night before infection and incubated with 0.5 ml of virus stock representing each subdivided library for 4 h in the presence of 10 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Then, 0.5 ml fresh DMEM-10% FCS was added to the culture and the incubation continued. The medium containing the retrovirus was changed to fresh DMEM-10% FCS 24 h later. Three days after the library transduction, S21 cells were cocultured (1 × 104 cells/well) on the transduced MS10 cells. To monitor the infection efficiency of cDNA libraries, a pMX vector containing enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA (CLONTECH) (pMX-GFP) (14Onishi M. Mui A.L. Morikawa Y. Cho L. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Gorman D.M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Blood. 1996; 88: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a control. The pMX-GFP retroviruses prepared similarly were infected to MS10 cells, and the infection efficiency was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The sequencing reaction was performed using a dRhodamine Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), and the sequence was analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 DNA sequencer. The full-length gene of the murine ISF was cloned from ST2-derived cDNAs by 5′RACE using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). A primer specific for ISF (GSP-1, 5′-TCTTGCTGGTTGGGAACAGGAAC-3′) was designed from the N-terminal end of C121, which was expected to amplify a region upstream of C121. GSP-1 was designed such that the product could overlap a 210-base pair sequence in C121 with a unique restriction site (AccI). Polymerase chain reaction was performed according to the recommended protocols of CLONTECH using the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix. One major band in the polymerase chain reaction product was detected corresponding to about 2.0 kilobase pairs in size. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned directly into a TA vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and identified as the 5′-end of ISF. A full-length cDNA was generated by ligation of C121 with the 5′RACE product using the unique restriction site present in the overlapping sequence. FLAG-tagged forms of ShIF and ISF cDNA were constructed at the C terminus by replacing their termination codons with the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDKI) through a NotI site. The resulting constructs were cloned into a mammalian expression vector pME18S (15Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5082-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which is driven by the SRα promoter. cDNAs used in deletion experiments were generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers obtained from the ISF cDNA sequence. All deletion mutants were FLAG-tagged at the C terminus and cloned into pME18S. The sequences of these mutants were confirmed by sequencing. To detect the secreted form of ShIF, COS7 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates a day before transfection and transfected with the FLAG-tagged pME-ShIF construct using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h of culture, the supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG BioM2 affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmNaVO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) three times. The bound proteins were eluted by the sample buffer, applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with anti-FLAG BioM2 antibody, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated complex, and subsequently developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to ECL Hyperfilm. To detect membrane-bound ShIF, cells were lysed with lysis buffer and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG affinity gel, and detection of the FLAG fusion protein was performed as described above. One liter of culture supernatant produced from COS7 cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged construct of ShIF cDNA was applied to an anti-FLAG affinity gel column. Bound proteins were eluted from the column by competition with FLAG peptide (60 µg/ml) at 1 ml/min, and 2-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 10–16, which contained the purified FLAG fusion protein, were used for the bioassay. COS7 cells were grown on coverslips for 1 day in the culture media and were transfected with FLAG-tagged ShIF or ISF constructs using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, the cells were cultured for 2 days, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 2 h. The cells were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under dark conditions for 1 h. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were viewed under a fluorescence microscope. Ba/F3 or S21 cells (1 × 104/well) were cultured in 96-well plates (100 µl culture volume) in the presence of either the culture supernatant derived from ShIF-transfected COS7 cells or the purified ShIF protein for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell growth was determined using a standard assay kit (Cell Titer 96 Assay) by Promega. To confirm the activity of ShIF, ShIF was removed from the supernatant by incubation with an anti-FLAG affinity gel for 2 h at 4 °C. The anti-FLAG-ShIF complex was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and the stripped supernatant was used for cell assay. Stable cell lines of PA6 and MS10 cells expressing ShIF were generated by infecting PA6 and MS10 cells with virus supernatant derived from pMX-neo-ShIF-transfected packaging cells followed by selection with G418 (1.2 mg/ml). Two 8-week-old mice (female, ICR strain) were used in the preparation of bone marrow cells using standard procedures. The unfractionated bone marrow cells (1 × 104 per well) were seeded on stromal layers that had been grown in 24-well plates for 48 h and were cultured for 1 week before photographs were taken. COS7 cells were plated (2 × 105/well) in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection and transfected with 1 µg of FLAG-tagged ShIF or ISF expression construct/well for 4 h using the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method. Then, the transfection solution was removed and was replaced with fresh DMEM-10% FCS. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 10 and 100 µm of various protease inhibitors. Supernatants and cell lysates were collected after 48 h, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and FLAG fusion protein was detected by ECL Western blotting reagents as described. Culture of EMS-treated Ba/F3 cells on ST2 stromal cells took about 5–6 weeks before distinct colonies were visualized adhering to the stromal layer (Fig.1). In the case of nonmutated Ba/F3 cells (a negative control), the cells failed to survive after 6 days of coculture, and no visible colonies were found after 6 weeks. Of the 48 clones isolated, 8 clones failed to proliferate when they were recultured on ST2 stroma cells, and 19 clones responded to GM-CSF and proliferated, indicating that those mutants ectopically expressed the receptor for GM-CSF by mutagenesis. Among the remaining 21 clones, 4 clones (S6, S9, S21, and S24) that showed strong proliferation were challenged by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against macrophage-CSF, SCF, and IL-1. Of these 4 clones, only 1 clone (S24) was affected by antibody against mSCF (data not shown). Of the remaining 3 clones, S21 showed the best proliferative response and was subjected for further experiments. 12,000 independent clones derived from an ST2 cDNA library were screened using subdivided pools. In the screening, the library was divided into small pools (120 clones/pool). Miniprep DNA was prepared from each pool, which was then used to transfect BOSC23 cells to obtain library-derived retroviruses. The resulting retroviruses were infected to MS10 cells that did not support the growth of S21 cells, and 2 days after infection S21 cells were seeded on the infected MS10 cells. After about 3–4 weeks of culture, one of the 96 screened pools (No. 2-21) was identified to support proliferation of S21 cells. A total of 148 single clones was picked from this pool for further screening. Two single clones (2-21-C121 and 2-21-C126) were found to give a phenotype identical with that of the original pool 2-21. The mutant S21 cells attached and proliferated on the MS10 cell layer transduced with clone 2-21-C121 (Fig. 2 a) and with clone 2-21-C126 (data not shown) but not on uninfected cells (Fig.2 b) or on cells infected with another clone (Fig.2 c). Parental Ba/F3 cells did not proliferate on MS10 cells transduced with the positive clone (Fig. 2 d). The two positive clones (C121 and C126) turned out to include the same sequence. The cDNA insert of clones C121 and C126 was 1.22 kilobase pairs long and contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 263 amino acids (Fig.3 A). The N-terminal 14 amino acid residues constituted a hydrophobic amino acid sequence typical of signal peptides with a predicted cleavage site between amino acids 20 and 21 (indicated by an arrowhead) (von Heijne method, PSORT II prediction). The initiator codon (ATG) was 75 bases from the 5′-end of the insert. No typical consensus sequence for translation initiation was found in the 5′-untranslated region. Hydrophobicity analysis for the reading frame predicted three membrane spanning segments (underlined). We searched sequence data bases and found that our sequence matched to a C-terminal part of a protein named immune suppressor factor (ISF) (8Lee C. Ghoshal K. Beaman K.D. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To confirm whether ISF was also expressed in ST2 cells, we cloned a full-length ISF gene by 5′RACE from cDNA derived from ST2 cells and obtained a full-length cDNA, which was identical with the published sequence (EMBL M31226). The full-length cDNA was 3010 base pairs long with a coding region of 2568 nucleotides (856 amino acids). There were at least six transmembrane regions in ISF, and ShIF contains three of these hydrophobic domains (Fig. 3 B). ShIF showed 39% sequence identity with the 95-kDa yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit, STV1 (16Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 54% with human and rat, 53% with bovine, and 42% with the C. elegans 116-kDa synaptic vesicle proton pump (VPP1) (17Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Xie X.S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the amino acid level. To determine the expression of the mRNA corresponding to the C121 cDNA, Northern blot analysis was carried out using the C121 cDNA as a probe. Three transcripts were ubiquitously detected with sizes of about 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 kilobases in all of the mouse tissues examined. Relatively higher expression levels were observed in kidney and liver, whereas lower levels of expression were observed in the spleen, testis, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 A). Among various mouse stroma cell lines tested, only ST2 and ST0 cells expressed the transcripts hybridizing C121 cDNA, whereas the other mouse-derived cell lines including MS10 did not express them (Fig.4 B). First, we asked whether ShIF was secreted into the culture media. To this end, we analyzed the supernatant and cell extract of COS7 cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged ShIF expression construct or a FLAG-tagged ISF expression construct. The FLAG-tagged ShIF protein was detected in the supernatant (Fig. 5, lane 3) as well as in the cell extract (Fig. 5, lane 4), suggesting that the membrane-integrated ShIF was shed into the supernatant. The predicted mature protein encoded by the ShIF cDNA consisted of 243 amino acids with a calculated molecular size of 27 kDa. The apparent molecular weight of the FLAG-tagged protein in the Western blot for both supernatant and cell extract samples (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4, respectively) was consistent with the predicted molecular weight. Thus, it was concluded that ShIF existed as a secreted protein as well as a membrane-integrated protein. Second, we attempted to express a full-length ISF cDNA in COS7 cells to test whether the full-length form was also secreted into the medium. Interestingly, we only detected a 27-kDa protein species in the supernatant of the transfected COS7 cells which co-migrated with ShIF (Fig. 5, lane 5). In addition to this short form ISF (sISF), a putative full-length form of the ISF protein was also detected in the cell extract but not in the supernatant. The apparent molecular weight of the putative full-length form was 87 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 6). In an immunofluorescence study, the membrane localization of ShIF and ISF was confirmed (Fig. 6).Figure 6Subcellular localization of ShIF and ISF. COS7 cells were grown in tissue culture coverslips and transfected with FLAG-tagged pME-ShIF or pME-ISF construct. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with anti-FLAG BioM2 antibody then with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. a, COS7 cells under epi-illumination showing immunofluorescent surface staining of ShIF. b, the same field of COS7 cells under visible light. c, COS7 cells under epi-illumination showing immunofluorescent surface staining of ISF.d, same field of COS7 cells under visible light. Control experiments using anti-FLAG alone (e) and secondary antibody alone (f) are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ISF is composed of a 400-amino acid extracellular domain, a 409-amino acid region spanning at least six transmembrane domains, and a short (47 amino acids) cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3 A). To examine the functional relevance of these domains, we generated a series of deletion mutants of ISF (Fig. 7 A). DNAs were transiently transfected into COS7 cells in 6-well plates, and the supernatant and the cell extracts were examined for expression of the FLAG-tagged protein. As shown in Fig. 7 B, all but for the ShIF deletion mutant (Δ ShIF) produced the secreted form of the protein (left panel). When the cell extracts were examined (right panel), the membrane-bound FLAG-tagged products were detected, confirming that all of the constructs were efficiently transfected and expressed membrane-bound forms of the wild type and the mutant ISF. These results indicated that a ShIF-like molecule indeed existed as a naturally occurring form sISF of the molecule. Culture supernatants obtained from ShIF-transfected COS7 cells were able to support the growth of S21 but not the parent Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 8 A). When ShIF was removed from the supernatant using anti-FLAG affinity gel, this activity was abolished, thereby confirming that the growth of the mutant cells depended on the presence of the soluble ShIF (data not shown). The growth-promoting activity of ShIF on S21 cells was also confirmed by an assay using purified recombinant ShIF (Fig.8 B).Figure 8Proliferative responses of S21 mutant and parental Ba/F3 cells to ShIF. A, S21 cells (closed symbols) but not Ba/F3 cells (open symbols) proliferated in response to ShIF. Culture supernatants from COS7 cells transfected with ShIF (triangles) as well as from empty vector (squares) started at 25% by volume were serially diluted 2-fold across 12 wells in a 96-well plate.

Conc., concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enforced expression of ShIF in MS10 cells, bone marrow stroma cells that do not express endogenous ISF, conferred the cells with an ability to support the growth of S21 cells (data not shown), which was more efficient than that of the culture supernatant of ShIF-transfected COS7 cells. This result indicated that the membrane-bound form ShIF was more potent than soluble ShIF in promoting proliferation of S21 cells. To examine the role of ShIF/sISF in normal hematopoiesis, we cultured bone marrow cells on stroma cells MS5 and ST2 that expressed endogenous ShIF and stroma cells PA6 and MS10 that did not express endogenous ISF but were stably transduced with ShIF. After 1 week of culture, we found that stroma cells MS5 (Fig.9 a) and ST2 (Fig. 9 b) that expressed endogenous ISF as well as PA6 and MS10 stroma transduced with ShIF (Fig. 9, g and h, respectively), supported substantial proliferation of bone marrow cells. PA6 and MS10 cells that had not been transduced with ShIF or that had been transduced only with the empty vector (Fig. 9, c–f) did not support proliferation of bone marrow cells. These results suggested that ShIF/sISF promoted proliferation of normal hematopoietic cells as well. To examine the regulation of ShIF/sISF secretion, we used a number of protease inhibitors and determined whether they inhibited the release of ShIF/sISF from the membrane. Addition of all the protease inhibitors tested blocked the release of ShIF/sISF into the medium (Fig.10, A and C) in both ShIF- and ISF-transfected cells. On the other hand, the membrane-bound form remained unchanged in ShIF-transfected cells and mostly unchanged in ISF-transfected cells (Fig. 10 B). In addition to the block of ShIF/sISF secretion, pepstatin A and leupeptin also blocked formation of sISF from ISF. Interestingly, a small amount of the full-length ISF was released into the supernatant, which was not blocked by any protease inhibitors (Fig. 10 C). In ISF-transfected cells, expression of the membrane-bound ISF was either partially or completely inhibited by some of the inhibitors used (Fig.10 D). Even lower concentrations of the inhibitors (10 µm) still blocked the release of the soluble form of the protein except for bestatin (data not shown). Thus, it was indicated that the release of ShIF/sISF as well as formation of sISF from ISF was due to proteolytic processing. In this paper, we have presented a novel approach of cloning cDNAs encoding stroma-derived proteins that would support proliferation of hematopoietic cells. The strategy consists of the following procedures: 1) mutagenesis of a factor-dependent cell line, Ba/F3; 2) establishment of stroma-dependent Ba/F3 mutants; 3) identification of supportive and nonsupportive stroma cell lines for each mutant; and 4) complementation cloning of the factor that stimulates proliferation of a mutant Ba/F3 clone. A unique feature of Ba/F3 cells has made this approach possible; they proliferate in response to a single cytokine, IL-3. In combination with EMS mutagenesis, theoretically all soluble growth factors derived from stroma cells can be identified by this screening. In addition, retrovirus-mediated expression cloning has made it possible to identify membrane-bound growth factors that require cell-cell contact to support cell growth. Using this strategy, we identified the ShIF protein from ST2 cells that supported the growth of Ba/F3 mutant S21 as well as bone marrow cells. A data base search demonstrated that the ShIF protein is a C-terminal part (263 amino acids) of ISF (856 amino acids) (8Lee C. Ghoshal K. Beaman K.D. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ISF protein was originally isolated from a T cell hybridoma using antibodies that bind proteins involved in modulating immune responses using in vitro translated products (8Lee C. Ghoshal K. Beaman K.D. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was reported that ISF suppressed a mixed lymphocyte reaction. We performed a similar assay using purified recombinant ShIF; however, we did not detect the inhibitory activities in mixed lymphocyte reaction (data not shown). When we expressed ShIF in COS7 cells, both secreted and membrane-bound forms were detected. We then expressed ISF to examine whether the full-length mature protein could also be expressed, and interestingly what was released into the medium was mainly sISF, the short form of ISF. Analysis of the cell extract obtained from the cells transfected with the ISF cDNA showed that in addition to the full-length mature protein, a smaller membrane-bound form (sISF) was present that corresponded to ShIF. Thus, a ShIF-like molecule, sISF, also exists as a naturally occurring protein. Experiments using protease inhibitors indicated that sISF was a proteolytic product of ISF. All protease inhibitors tested blocked the release of ShIF/sISF to the culture supernatant. The responsive protease and the proteolytic sites are still to be determined. Deletion analysis of the major domains of ISF indicated the importance of the ShIF/sISF domain of the molecule. In fact, MS10 cells expressing the ShIF-deletion mutant were not able to support the growth of S21 cells (data not shown). Finally, the high homology of ShIF and ISF to vacuolar proton pumps suggested the possibility that these proteins are involved in coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation thereby contributing to cell growth through yet unidentified mechanisms. It is also unclear at present how S21 became ST2 stroma-dependent by mutagenesis. In the complementation experiment presented here, the mutant cell was supposed to express a receptor for a stroma-derived factor. However, we do not know whether a receptor for proton pump exists. Increased proton export through pumps or ion exchange channels itself could be a mechanism by which these molecules protect cells from undergoing apoptosis (18Gottlieb R.A. Gruol D.L. Zhu J.Y. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2391-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For instance, in hematopoietic stem cells, GM-CSF delays apoptosis by cytoplasmic alkalinization through activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (19Rajotte D. Haddad P. Haman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9980-9987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The findings of the present study indicate that ShIF corresponds to a naturally occurring short form of ISF protein produced by the proteolytic machinery, suggesting that a proton pump-like molecule, ISF, plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation."
