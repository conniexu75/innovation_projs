Patients with heart failure who were hetero- or homozygous for the Gly-49 variant of the β1AR (Gly-49-β1AR) showed improved long-term survival as compared with those with the Ser-49 genotype. Here, the functional consequences of this polymorphism were studied in cells expressing either variant. The Gly-49-β1AR demonstrated characteristic features of constitutively active receptors. In cells expressing the Gly-49-β1AR, both basal and agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were higher than in cells expressing the Ser-49 variant (Ser-49-β1AR). The Gly-49-β1AR was more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the inverse agonist metoprolol and displayed increased affinity for agonists. Isoproterenol potency for adenylyl cyclase activation was higher on membranes expressing the Gly-49-β1AR than on those expressing the Ser-49-β1AR. After incubation with saturating concentrations of catecholamines or sustained stimulation, the Gly-49 variant showed a much higher desensitization, which largely prevailed over constitutive activity in terms of cAMP accumulation. The Gly-49-β1AR also displayed a more profound agonist-promoted down-regulation than the Ser-49 variant. The stronger regulation of the Gly-49-β1AR could explain the beneficial effect of the Gly-49 genotypes on survival, further supporting the concept that β1AR desensitization is protective in heart failure.

Stimulation of myocardial β1AR by catecholamines results in the activation of the heterotrimeric Gs protein, which, in turn, activates the adenylyl cyclase (AC) and promotes the production of cAMP. During chronic heart failure (HF) the persistent compensatory increase of catecholamines causes β1AR desensitization and down-regulation. The resulting partial loss of β1AR function is believed to be an adaptive mechanism to counteract the cardiotoxicity of chronic adrenergic signaling (2Bristow M.R. Circulation. 2000; 101: 558-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that β1-adrenergic blockade has proved to be effective in the treatment of chronic HF (3MERITH-HF Study groupLancet. 1999; 353: 2001-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar, 4CIBIS-II Investigators and CommitteésLancet. 1999; 353: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar).

Heart J. 1999; 20: 629Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), myocardial disease. In contrast, the allelic distribution of β1AR polymorphism at codon 49 was found to be associated with long term survival of patients with chronic HF (5Borjesson M. Magnusson Y. Hjalmarson A. Andersson B. Eur. Heart J. 2000; 21: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Patients with the Ser-49 genotype showed a high mortality rate (46%) after 5 years, whereas patients either homozygous or heterozygous for the Gly-49 variant showed a mortality rate of only 23%. Because of the major role of β1AR in both normal and failing myocardium, the beneficial effect of the Gly-49-β1AR on survival in HF patients might be due to specific features of this variant in terms of receptor signaling and/or regulation. To address this question, we compared the pharmacological and functional properties of Ser-49-β1AR and Gly-49-β1AR after stable transfection in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Our data show that the Gly-49 and Ser-49 variants differ in terms of coupling to the downstream adenylyl cyclase pathway and agonist-dependent regulation. They also provide a plausible explanation for the myocardial-protective effect of the Gly-49-β1AR in patients with chronic HF. The deoxyadenosine at position 145 in the coding sequence for Ser-49 of the human β1AR gene was changed for a deoxycytidine by site-directed mutagenesis, using the method of Kunkel (10Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar), to generate a codon for glycine at position 49. The mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Both Ser- and Gly-encoding β1AR cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. Nearly confluent human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 1 mm glutamine at 37 °C and transfected with 8 μg of vector coding for either the Ser-49-β1AR or the Gly-49-β1AR. Clones resistant to 1 mg/ml G418 were screened for β1AR expression by radioligand binding assay using 125I-CYP (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) as ligand. Fresh human left ventricular myocardium specimens were obtained from two patients with chronic HF during implantation of left ventricular mechanical support. The patients were enrolled in the national registry for dilated cardiomyopathy, approved by the Ethics Committee at Göteborg University, and had given informed consent. Crude membranes were prepared by homogenization in ice-cold buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitors as described below), filtered through gauze fiber, and immediately analyzed for AC activity. Radioligand binding assays were performed on membranes, prepared as described previously (11Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar), or on whole cells in a final volume of 250 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12 mm MgCl2, and 0–400 pm125I-CYP. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol. Membranes were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C, filtered through Whatman GF/C filters, and washed three times with the same ice-cold buffer. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Competition binding experiments were performed with 80 pm125I-CYP and increasing concentrations of various agonists and antagonists. Ligand affinities were calculated using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Non-exposed cells or cells exposed to 10 μmisoproterenol (ISO) and 10 μm ascorbic acid or 10 μm ascorbic acid alone for 20 min at 37 °C were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffer saline and harvested mechanically using a pipette. After centrifugation at 800 ×g, cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, and 10 mg/liter benzamidine) and membranes were prepared (11Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). The AC activity was determined in 2–5 μg of membranes resuspended in 60 μl of 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm ATP, 0.053 mm GTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 2.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mCi of [α-32P]ATP, 0.2 unit of pyruvate kinase, 1 unit of myokinase, and [3H]cAMP (∼60,000 cpm). Enzyme activity was determined in the absence or presence of 0.1 nm to 100 μm ISO or 100 μm metoprolol for 15 min at 37 °C. Membranes incubated with 10 μm forskolin were used as positive controls. The reaction was stopped with 200 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m HCl, followed by 5 min of boiling. Samples were buffered with 0.2 ml of 1.5 m imidazole, pH 7.5, and finally applied to Al2O2 columns. [α-32P]cAMP was eluted with 3 ml of 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, and counted in a β-counter (LKB Wallac). Dose-response curves of AC activity were analyzed using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software). Intracellular cAMP was measured in intact cells exposed to the indicated concentrations of ISO, norepinephrine (NE), or metoprolol, in the presence of IBMX for 10 min at 37 °C (dose-response experiments), or in the absence of IBMX, for 0–8 h at 37 °C, with fresh ligands added every other hour (time-course experiments). Ascorbic acid (10 μm) was added in the incubation medium to prevent catecholamine oxidation. After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA. The suspension was boiled for 3 min and centrifuged. The cAMP contained in the supernatant was measured with a [3H]cAMP assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Receptor internalization was determined by measuring the number of “sequestered” receptors that became inaccessible to the hydrophilic membrane-impermeable ligand CGP-12177A after agonist stimulation, as previously described (12Nantel F. Bonin H. Emorine L.J. Zilberfarb V. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 548-555PubMed Google Scholar). The total number of receptors was measured using the membrane-permeable125I-CYP radioligand, and the amount of intracellular receptors was determined as the number of 125I-CYP binding sites that could not be displaced by a 3.5-h incubation with 3 μm CGP-12177A at 13 °C. Surface receptors were calculated as the difference between total and intracellular receptors. Sequestered receptors correspond to the loss of surface receptors induced by agonist stimulation. Receptor down-regulation was determined in nearly confluent cells incubated with 1 μm ISO and 10 μm ascorbic acid, for 0–20 h at 37 °C, in culture medium containing 5 μg/ml cycloheximide. Values are mean ± S.E. or mean ± S.D. as given in the figure legends. Significant differences between means were calculated with Student's ttest for either paired or unpaired observations. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To test the hypothesis that the natural substitution of a serine by a glycine residue in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the β1AR may affect its functional properties, the cDNAs of the Gly-49-β1AR and of the Ser-49-β1AR were transfected in human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells. Stable clones expressing variable amounts (∼0.5 to ∼5 pmol/mg) of either β1AR variant were selected. Both Ser-49 and Gly-49 receptor variants bound catecholamine agonists with a rank order of potency that is characteristic of the β1AR subtype: isoproterenol > norepinephrine > epinephrine (data not shown). High and low affinity states for agonists were resolved for both receptor variants (Table I). The percentage of receptors found in the high affinity state for agonists was comparable in the two variants, although the Gly-49-β1AR displayed a general trend toward a stronger affinity for agonists. The high affinity constant of the Gly-49-β1AR for NE was significantly lower than that of the Ser-49-β1AR (50 ± 16 and 137 ± 26 nm, respectively, p < 0.05) as was its low affinity constant for ISO (182 ± 16 and 268 ± 17 nm, respectively, p < 0.01). Competition binding experiments with antagonists on membrane fractions did not show any significant difference between receptor variants (Table I).Table ILigand binding properties of the Ser-49 and Gly-49 variants of β1ARLigandKiHighKiLowRHighnm%Ser-49-β1ARISO0.43 ± 0.2268 ± 1723 ± 2.4NE137 ± 263602 ± 67627 ± 6.8ICYP57 ± 41-aKd values for125I-CYP are expressed in pm.ALP3.2 ± 0.8METO54 ± 9Gly-49-β1ARISO0.23 ± 0.11187 ± 161-bp < 0.01 versusSer-49-β1AR.24 ± 2.8NE50 ± 161-cp < 0.05 versusSer-49-β1AR.2413 ± 70817 ± 1.4ICYP62 ± 61-aKd values for125I-CYP are expressed in pm.ALP3.4 ± 0.5METO72 ± 131-a Kd values for125I-CYP are expressed in pm.1-b p < 0.01 versusSer-49-β1AR.1-c p < 0.05 versusSer-49-β1AR. Open table in a new tab β1ARs are known to couple exclusively to Gs proteins, leading to the activation of AC. To investigate whether β1AR polymorphism at codon 49 might affect receptor coupling efficacy to Gs, basal and ISO-stimulated AC activities were measured in membranes prepared from cell clones expressing various densities of either β1AR variant (Fig.1). Maximal, membrane-associated, AC activity promoted by forskolin was comparable in the two groups of clones (267 ± 59 and 279 ± 57 pmol/mg/min for Ser-49-β1AR and Gly-49-β1AR, respectively, n = 6, data not shown). Dose-response curves of Ser-49 and Gly-49 clones for AC activation were compared either at “low” (Fig. 1A) or “high” (Fig. 1B) densities of receptors. In both cases, basal and maximal ISO-dependent AC activities were significantly higher in membranes expressing the Gly-49-β1AR. In addition, the Gly-49 variant exhibited a significantly higher potency for ISO than the Ser-49 variant (EC50 of 11.0 ± 4.1 versus 35.0 ± 5.5 nm, p < 0.05). To confirm this observation, basal and maximal ISO-dependent AC activities were measured in additional cell clones (Fig. 1, C and D). On average, basal AC activity was 4-fold higher in membranes prepared from Gly-49-β1AR cells than in membranes from Ser-49-β1AR cells (n = 11, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1C). Similarly, maximal ISO-stimulated AC activity was, on average, 2-fold higher in Gly-49-β1AR membranes than in Ser-49-β1AR membranes (n = 11, p < 0.01) (Fig.1D). From the results above, it appears that the replacement of the Ser-49 residue of the human β1AR by a Gly residue is associated with striking changes of receptor function, including constitutive activation of basal cAMP production and amplification of the response to ISO. According to previous studies on constitutively active receptors, β1-adrenergic inverse agonists would be expected to cause a stronger inhibition of the basal AC activity in Gly-49-β1AR membranes than in Ser-49-β1AR membranes. Metoprolol, a β1-selective β-blocker widely used for the treatment of chronic HF, is a weak inverse agonist of the β1AR, as shown in transfected fibroblasts expressing exogenous constitutively active receptors and in transgenic mice overexpressing the β1AR (13Lattion A. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Engelhardt S. Grimmer Y. Fan G.H. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar). Basal AC activity was reduced upon incubation with 100 μm metoprolol in both Ser-49 and Gly-49 membranes (from 8.3 ± 1.3 to 5.7 ± 0.8 pmol/mg/min, p < 0.05, and from 25 ± 4.3 to 14 ± 2.4 pmol/mg/min, p < 0.01, respectively). However, the inhibition was significantly stronger in Gly-49 membranes (42 ± 1.7% versus 29 ± 5.6%, p < 0.05) (Table II). The higher inverse agonism of metoprolol on Gly-49-β1AR was confirmed in intact cells. A 10-min incubation with metoprolol caused a significant decrease of cAMP accumulation only in cells expressing the Gly-49-β1AR variant (from 54 to 30 pmol/mg, p < 0.05).Table IIInverse agonism of metoprolol on the Ser-49 and Gly-49 variants of β1ARMembranal AC activity% change from basalIntracellular cAMP level% change from basalBasalMetoprololBasalMetoprololpmol/mg/minpmol/mgSer-49-β1AR8.3 ± 1.35.7 ± 0.82-ap < 0.05versus basal.−29 ± 5.621 ± 7.717 ± 4.3−14 ± 8.6Gly-49-β1AR25 ± 4.315 ± 2.42-bp < 0.01 versusbasal.−42 ± 1.72-cp < 0.05 versusSer-49-β1AR.54 ± 1130 ± 1.02-ap < 0.05versus basal.−40 ± 9.12-cp < 0.05 versusSer-49-β1AR.2-a p < 0.05versus basal.2-b p < 0.01 versusbasal.2-c p < 0.05 versusSer-49-β1AR. Open table in a new tab Functional differences between receptor variants may also arise from the duration of the cellular signal they generate, which, in turn, depends on desensitization mechanisms (15Bohn L.M. Gainetdinov R.R. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Desensitization was first studied by comparing the AC activity in membranes from cells, expressing ∼1 pmol of receptor per milligram of protein, pre-stimulated or not with ISO for 20 min. In both cases, receptor desensitization was characterized by a reduction of maximal AC activity and by a rightward shift of dose-response curves (Fig.2). Although a 2-fold increase of EC50 values was observed for both variants, there was a marked difference in the extent to which the two β1AR variants were desensitized. Maximal AC activity was reduced by 57 ± 8% in membranes expressing the Gly-49-β1AR, whereas the reduction was only 19 ± 3% for Ser-49-β1AR (p < 0.01). The study of additional cell clones expressing various receptor densities of either β1AR variant showed that the different degrees of desensitization observed in these experiments are indeed attributable to the intrinsic properties of each variant (Fig. 3).FIG. 3Short-term desensitization of AC activity as a function of receptor density. Maximal desensitization of AC activity, measured on membranes prepared from cells expressing various densities of Ser-49-β1AR (○) and Gly-49-β1AR (●).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the different extent of desensitization between the two β1AR variants observed in membrane preparations could affect the concentration of cAMP reached in intact cells, dose-response assays of agonist-promoted cAMP accumulation were carried out on cells from the same clones as in Fig. 3. The intracellular cAMP, accumulated during 10-min incubation with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX alone, was higher in Gly-49 cells than in Ser-49 cells (56 ± 11 versus 25 ± 5.2 pmol/mg, p < 0.05), which reflected well the differences of basal AC activity found between the two variants (Fig.4). The intracellular cAMP concentration reached in Gly-49 and Ser-49 cells, after 10-min stimulation with 1 nm ISO (a concentration 10–30 times below the EC50 of AC stimulation, as determined in Fig. 1), was comparable. However, after stimulation with higher concentrations of ISO, cAMP was significantly lower in cells expressing the Gly variant than in Ser-49 cells. Similar results were obtained with the natural ligand NE: intracellular cAMP was significant lower in cells expressing the Gly variant upon stimulation with NE at concentrations of 1 μm or above (data not shown). The myocardium of patients with chronic HF is permanently subjected to increased levels of endogenous catecholamines. We investigated whether, in the context of sustained stimulation with ISO or NE, the different desensitization profile of β1AR variants would result in distinct cAMP responses in the HEK-293 model. Cells expressing either receptor variant were incubated for up to 8 h with saturating concentrations of agonists (Fig. 5). Maximal stimulation with ISO or NE promoted a comparable raise of intracellular cAMP at 2 min, for Ser and Gly (431 ± 40 and 335 ± 30 pmol/mg, respectively, in the presence of ISO; 428 ± 32 and 360 ± 27 pmol/mg, respectively, in the presence of NE). However, for longer incubation times with agonist, a significant decrease of intracellular cAMP was observed in Gly-49-β1AR cells compared with Ser-49-β1AR cells. To investigate if sustained stimulation with non-saturating concentrations of natural ligand would also promote a different cAMP accumulation in cells expressing either the Gly-49-β1AR or the Ser-49-β1AR variant, cells were exposed to 1 μm NE (Fig. 6). In cells expressing the Ser-49 variant, stimulated cAMP levels remained stable throughout the experiment (159 ± 13 and 154 ± 6.8 pmol/mg, at times 10 min and 8 h, respectively). In contrast, stimulated cAMP levels decreased with time in cells expressing the Gly-49-β1AR, reaching a maximal decrease of 50% at 8 h (from 140 ± 5 to 67 ± 0.1 pmol/mg, from times 10 min to 8 h).FIG. 6Intracellular cAMP in cells expressing the Ser-49 or Gly-49 variants of β1AR and submitted to sustained activation by non-saturating concentrations of NE. Intact cells expressing either the Ser-49-β1AR (○) or the Gly-49-β1AR (●) were exposed to 1 μm NE for 10 min to 8 h. Values are mean ± S.D. of two experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Taken together, desensitization studies indicate that, in the presence of a sustained stimulation by catecholamines, the signal promoted by the “myocardium-protective” Gly-49-β1AR is turned off much faster and more completely than that promoted by the Ser-49-β1AR. Previous studies have shown that β1ARs are much more resistant to ligand-promoted endocytosis than β2ARs (11Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We examined whether the different desensitization profile reported above might be reflected at the level of β1AR trafficking. Receptor sequestration assays, based on competition between the membrane-impermeable ligand CGP-12177A and the membrane-permeable radioligand 125I-CYP, showed that pretreatment with 10 μm ISO for 30 min did not significantly affect the number of surface β1ARs in cells expressing the Ser-49 variant, whereas ∼15% of the Gly-49-β1AR was sequestered under the same conditions (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, important differences between variants were observed for longer times of exposure to the agonist (Fig. 7B). ISO stimulation of cells expressing Gly-49-β1AR for 15 min to 20 h resulted in a time-dependent reduction of the total number of receptors, reaching 40% after 20 h (p < 0.01, n = 5). This down-regulation mainly affected surface receptors (Fig. 7B, inset). In contrast, the Ser-49-β1AR was not down-regulated under the same conditions (5.0 ± 10%, p = NS). In the present study we have shown that the polymorphism of the 49th codon of the β1AR, which was previously found to be associated with the duration of survival among patients with chronic HF, determines important functional differences between receptor variants. The Gly-49-β1AR mediated higher basal and agonist-stimulated AC activities compared with the Ser-49 variant and was more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the inverse agonist metoprolol. In addition, the Gly-49-β1AR displayed a moderate but significant increase of affinity for agonists, and ISO showed a higher potency for AC activation in membranes prepared from cells expressing the Gly-49-β1AR than in Ser-49 membranes. Most properties summarized above are characteristic of constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The marked amplification of the response to the agonist and the moderate changes of Kd and Kact values are less common, but they were reported for some GPCRs with constitutive activity, such as the Asn-111 mutant of the AT1A receptor (17Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1822-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). According to the modified ternary complex model of GPCR activation (18Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutations causing constitutive activation are likely to facilitate the isomerization between active and inactive conformations of the receptor. Although most receptor-activating mutations lie in intracellular regions interacting with G proteins or in adjacent transmembrane domains, they can also occur in extracellular regions. For example, several mutations of the extracellular domain of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor were reported to cause constitutive activation of the receptor in patients with toxic adenomas (19Parma J. Van Sande J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymorphism within the N-terminal region was also found for the β2AR. The Gly-16-β2AR, for example, showed a 5-fold increase of agonist sensitivity, although this variant did not display higher basal activity as in the case of the Gly-49-β1AR. The mechanism, by which the Ser-49 → Gly substitution facilitates β1AR activation, will remain speculative before structural studies. However, it is plausible that, because of the very different conformational preferences of glycine and serine residues (20Koehl P. Levitt M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the Ser → Gly substitution may cause a sliding or a change in the orientation of the adjacent transmembrane domain and, consequently, in the overall conformation of the receptor. This hypothesis is consistent with the current model of GPCR stimulation by peptides, which activate the receptors by interacting with amino acid residues located in their extracellular regions (21Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). A second striking feature of the Gly-49 variant of the β1AR is its high propensity for desensitization. Increased desensitization was evident for high concentrations of catecholamines and/or sustained stimulation of the receptor. Under these conditions, the level of cAMP was indeed much lower in cells expressing the Gly-49 variant than in cells expressing the less active Ser-49-β1AR. The association between constitutive activity and increased sensitivity to desensitization is probably not fortuitous, because a number of adrenergic receptor mutants generatedin vitro were characterized by structural instability (22Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), increased phosphorylation (23Ren Q. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), or changes in endocytosis (25Mhaouty-Kodja S. Barak L.S. Scheer A. Abuin L. Diviani D. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The higher level of Gly-49-β1AR desensitization might be explained by higher affinities of protein kinase A and/or G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) for this variant, as reported for constitutively active β2AR mutants (24Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that phosphorylation by both protein kinase A and GRKs contribute to β1AR desensitization (26Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The observation, that the desensitization of the Gly-49-β1AR was more noticeable in the case of sustained agonist activation or in the presence of agonist concentrations close to or above the Kd, suggests that GRKs are involved in this phenomenon, because it is well established that these kinases only phosphorylate receptors that are bound by the agonist. Sustained activation by the agonist failed to induce any significant down-regulation of the Ser-49-β1AR, whereas a substantial loss of receptor binding sites was observed in cells expressing the Gly-49 variant. GPCR down-regulation may be caused by the sorting of internalized receptors to the lysosomal compartment where they are degraded by resident proteases. The different down-regulation profile of the two β1AR variants might thus be explained by their different internalization rate (no significant internalization for the Ser variant versus 15% internalization for the Gly variant). Alternatively, because of its relatively low level of internalization, the Gly-β1AR might be directly degraded at the plasma membrane by proteases recognizing the activated conformation of the receptor. Such a mechanism, which does not require receptor internalization, was reported for the β2AR (27Jockers R. Angers S., Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The observation that the frequency of Gly-49-β1AR genotypes are not different between healthy controls and patients with congestive HF or patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (5Borjesson M. Magnusson Y. Hjalmarson A. Andersson B. Eur. Heart J. 2000; 21: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Magnusson Y. Börjesson M. Karrstedt E.-L. Hjalmarson A. Andersson B. Eur. Heart J. 1999; 20: 629Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggests that the functional properties of this variant are not sufficient, by themselves, to promote a myocardial disease. However, the improved survival of patients with chronic HF and of either a Gly-49/Ser-49 or a Gly-49/Gly-49 genotype, might reflect a direct contribution of the Gly-49-β1AR to the more favorable prognosis. In patients with HF, the impairment of cardiac output is compensated by a chronic increase of the sympathetic drive, resulting in permanently high concentrations of blood catecholamines. A number of studies, however, indicated that chronic adrenergic signaling in general and its β1AR component in particular, are harmful for myocardial tissue. Norepinephrine, the β1AR-selective catecholamine, was found to be cardiotoxic and to produce cardiac myocyte injury at concentrations found in failing human heart (28Mann D.L. Kent R.L. Parsons B. Cooper G.t. Circulation. 1992; 85: 790-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, a 5- to 40-fold overexpression of cardiac β1AR was reported to induce heart failure within months (29Engelhardt S. Hein L. Wiesmann F. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7059-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 30Bisognano J.D. Weinberger H.D. Bohlmeyer T.J. Pende A. Raynolds M.V. Sastravaha A. Roden R. Asano K. Blaxall B.C., Wu, S.C. Communal C. Singh K. Colucci W. Bristow M.R. Port D.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 817-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Similarly, a 3-fold overexpression of Gαs led to myocardial damage characterized by cellular degeneration, hypertrophy, and sudden death (31Iwase M. Bishop S.P. Uechi M. Vatner D.E. Shannon R.P. Kudej R.K. Wight D.C. Wagner T.E. Ishikawa Y. Homcy C.J. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In adult rat myocytes, the β1AR mediates apoptotic signal through Gs stimulation, whereas the β2AR is anti-apoptotic via its coupling to Giproteins (32Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In the failing heart, β-adrenergic signaling is reduced as a consequence of βAR desensitization and down-regulation and of increased activity of Gi proteins (33Bristow M.R. Hershberger R.E. Port J.D. Gilbert E.M. Sandoval A. Rasmussen R. Cates A.E. Feldman A.M. Circulation. 1990; 82: I12-I25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was proposed that this loss of β-adrenergic-transducing capacity might represent a protective/adaptive mechanism against catecholamine overload (2Bristow M.R. Circulation. 2000; 101: 558-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The rationale for β-adrenergic receptor blockade, the current established treatment of compensated chronic HF (3MERITH-HF Study groupLancet. 1999; 353: 2001-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar, 4CIBIS-II Investigators and CommitteésLancet. 1999; 353: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar), is in close accordance with this concept. Taken together, these data suggest that the protective effect of the Gly-49-β1AR in HF patients may depend on the higher sensitivity of this receptor variant to catecholamine-induced desensitization. In the context of the chronic adrenergic stimulation occurring in HF, the increased desensitization of the Gly-49 variant is likely to largely override its basal constitutive activity. This hypothesis is consistent with the much lower level of cAMP measured in cells expressing Gly-49-β1AR, compared with Ser-49-β1AR cells, upon sustained receptor activation. In addition, the observation that the inverse agonist metoprolol could decrease basal AC activity and cAMP content in cells expressing the Gly-49-β1AR suggests that inverse agonists might be more beneficial than neutral β-blockers in the treatment of patients with HF, which are homo- or heterozygous for the Gly-49 variant. Interestingly, during the time of the study, we could examine two myocardial specimens, one from a patient with Ser-49-β1AR (homozygous Ser-49 genotype), the other from a patient with Gly-49 (heterozygous Gly-49/Ser-49 genotype). Metoprolol displayed a significant β1AR inverse agonism in myocardial membranes from the patient with Gly-49 but not in membranes from the patient with Ser-49-β1AR (28 ± 5 versus 5 ± 5% reduction of basal AC activity, p < 0.005). Furthermore, basal and maximal AC activities were higher in membranes from the Gly-49 patient than in Ser-49 membranes (4 ± 0.2versus 0.6 ± 0.1 and 13 ± 0.6 versus2 ± 0.2 pmol/mg/min, respectively). The βAR densities were 37 and 30 fmol/mg, respectively. Although these data must be considered with caution due to inherent variability in the human population, they are consistent with the results obtained in transfected cells and with a previous clinical study showing that patients with at least one Gly-49-β1AR allele tended to respond better to β-blockers than patients devoid of this allele. The majority of these patients being treated with the inverse agonist metoprolol (5Borjesson M. Magnusson Y. Hjalmarson A. Andersson B. Eur. Heart J. 2000; 21: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have reported the first example of polymorphism associated with constitutive adrenergic receptor activation (13Lattion A. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S.

Although without known consequences in healthy subjects, the functional properties of the variants may affect long term prognosis of patients with chronic HF.

They are characterized by the presence of two regions of homology in the C-terminal non-catalytic domain, termed polo-box 1 (PB1) and polo-box 2 (PB2). Here we demonstrate that both PB1 and PB2 are required for targeting the catalytic activity of Plk1 to centrosomes, midbody, and kinetochores. Expression of either kinase-inactive PLK1/K82M or the C-terminalplk1ΔN induced a pre-anaphase arrest with elevated Cdc2 and Plk1 activity. Prophase-arrested cells exhibited randomly oriented spindle structures, whereas metaphase cells exhibited aberrant bipolar spindles with Mad2 localization at kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes. Microtubule nucleation activity of centrosomes was not compromised. In vivo time-lapse studies revealed that expression of plk1ΔN resulted in repeated cycles of bipolar spindle formation and disruption, suggestive of a defect in spindle stability. A prolonged arrest frequently led to the generation of micronucleated cells in the absence of sisterchromatid separation and centrosome duplication, indicating that micronucleation is not a result of accumulated cytokinesis failures. Interestingly, bypass of the mitotic arrest by dominant-negative spindle checkpoint components led to a failure in completion of cytokinesis.

Characterization of mutations in the prototype of these members, Drosophila polo, revealed that polo is important for the function of spindle poles and bipolar spindle formation at several developmental stages (1Sunkel C.L.

Microinjection of anti-Plks antibodies into either Xenopus embryos or cultured mammalian cells resulted in the formation of monopolar spindles (3Qian Y.W. Erikson E., Li, C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) with centrosome maturation defect, as evidenced by a decreased amount of γ-tubulin and MPM-2 antigens recruited to the centrosomes (4Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a kinase-inactive form of mammalian polo-like kinase Plk1 in most tumor cell lines was shown to induce centrosome maturation defect in combination with mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis (5Cogswell J.P. Brown C.E. Bisi J.E. Neill S.D. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 615-623PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that, in Plk1-deficient cells, a defect in centrosome maturation is the primary cause of a defect in bipolar spindle formation, which ultimately leads to cell death.A growing body of evidence suggests that Plks also play important roles in mitotic entry, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis. Xenopuspolo-like kinase Plx1 phosphorylates and activates Cdc25, which in turn dephosphorylates and activates Cdc2 (6Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct role of Plx1 in regulating mitotic entry. In addition, studies in various organisms have demonstrated that Plks are important in mitotic exit. Plk1 has been suggested to directly phosphorylate components of anaphase-promoting complex (APC)1 including Cdc27 and activate the latter (7Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Activated APC subsequently ubiquitinates mitotic cyclins, leading to their degradation and the inactivation of Cdc2 (for review, see Refs. 8Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 9Page A.M. Hieter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 583-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Plks also appear to contribute to the onset of cytokinesis in various low eucaryotic organisms (for review, see Ref. 10Glover D.M. Hagan I.M. Tavares A.A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies show thatDrosophila polo9 and polo10 mutants are defective in the metaphase/anaphase transition due to the activation of a tension-dependent spindle checkpoint (11Donaldson M.M. Tavares A.A. Ohkura H. Deak P. Glover D.M. J.

This separation is normally prevented by the spindle checkpoint until all the kinetochores are properly attached with stable bipolar spindles.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) as components regulating this pathway. In metazoan cells, homologues of these checkpoint proteins were shown to localize to unattached kinetochores to inactivate Cdc20/fizzy, a protein that directs the APC to a specific set of substrates (for review, see Refs.18Amon A.

Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), they may function in a concerted manner since loss of either one abrogates spindle checkpoint arrest in vivo (23Chan G.K.

Alignment of the C-terminal regions of known polo kinases revealed that they are composed of two domains with significant homology (polo-box 1 (PB1), from amino acids 405 to 494, and polo-box 2 (PB2), from amino acids 505 to 598 in Plk1) (25Hudson J.W.

In budding yeast, a highly conserved motif in PB1 of the budding yeast polo kinase Cdc5 is critical for its subcellular localization and mitotic functions. In mammalian cells, however, it is not yet known whether the PB1 and PB2 are important for subcellular localization or for a specific function of Plk1 during M-phase progression. To address these issues, we expressed various forms of Plk1 in U-2 OS cells using an adenovirus expression system. We show that both PB1 and PB2 are required for efficient subcellular localization of Plk1. Expression ofplk1ΔN, which contains both PB1 and PB2, induces a pronounced defect in establishing normal bipolar spindles and leads to the activation of a Mad2-dependent spindle checkpoint pathway. These arrested cells exhibited apparently normal centrosome maturation and microtubule nucleation activity, suggesting that expression of plk1ΔN induced a defect in forming normal bipolar spindles without influencing centrosome function. In addition, bypass of the spindle checkpoint arrest led to a failure in completing cytokinesis.

Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), they may function in a concerted manner since loss of either one abrogates spindle checkpoint arrest in vivo (23Chan G.K.

In addition to the kinase domain, the polo subfamily members are characterized by the presence of conserved regions of homology in the C-terminal non-catalytic domain. Alignment of the C-terminal regions of known polo kinases revealed that they are composed of two domains with significant homology (polo-box 1 (PB1), from amino acids 405 to 494, and polo-box 2 (PB2), from amino acids 505 to 598 in Plk1) (25Hudson J.W.

In budding yeast, a highly conserved motif in PB1 of the budding yeast polo kinase Cdc5 is critical for its subcellular localization and mitotic functions. In mammalian cells, however, it is not yet known whether the PB1 and PB2 are important for subcellular localization or for a specific function of Plk1 during M-phase progression. To address these issues, we expressed various forms of Plk1 in U-2 OS cells using an adenovirus expression system. We show that both PB1 and PB2 are required for efficient subcellular localization of Plk1. Expression ofplk1ΔN, which contains both PB1 and PB2, induces a pronounced defect in establishing normal bipolar spindles and leads to the activation of a Mad2-dependent spindle checkpoint pathway. These arrested cells exhibited apparently normal centrosome maturation and microtubule nucleation activity, suggesting that expression of plk1ΔN induced a defect in forming normal bipolar spindles without influencing centrosome function. In addition, bypass of the spindle checkpoint arrest led to a failure in completing cytokinesis. Our data suggest that the polo-box-dependent Plk1 function is required for bipolar spindle formation and cytokinesis. We are grateful to T.-C. He and B.

https://openalex.org/W2125943680,"The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) shares ∼20% sequence identity with the major histocompatibility complex class 1/CD1 family of molecules, accelerates the thrombin-thrombomodulin-dependent generation of activated protein C, a natural anticoagulant, binds to activated neutrophils, and can undergo translocation from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Blocking protein C/activated protein C binding to the receptor inhibits not only protein C activation but the ability of the host to respond appropriately to bacterial challenge, exacerbating both the coagulant and inflammatory responses. To understand how EPCR accomplishes these multiple tasks, we solved the crystal structure of EPCR alone and in complex with the phospholipid binding domain of protein C. The structures were strikingly similar to CD1d. A tightly bound phospholipid resides in the groove typically involved in antigen presentation. The protein C binding site is outside this conserved groove and is distal from the membrane-spanning domain. Extraction of the lipid resulted in loss of protein C binding, which could be restored by lipid reconstitution. CD1d augments the immune response by presenting glycolipid antigens.

Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complexes contain the zymogen, a membrane-bound enzyme, a cofactor protein, and Ca2+ ions all assembled on a negatively charged phospholipid surface. Complete complex assembly is essential to rapid activation of the bound zymogen. In most cases, binding of the zymogen and the protease to the membrane is mediated by a specialized vitamin K-dependent domain containing γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla, and referred to as the Gla domain). For these complexes to function efficiently, it is critical that negatively charged phospholipids be mobilized to the cell surface, an event that requires a potent cell agonist (2Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W.C. Harmsma M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 973-986PubMed Google Scholar). Balancing the clotting system are several natural anticoagulant mechanisms. One of the most potent is the protein C anticoagulant pathway. The critical nature of the pathway is demonstrated by the clinical observation that homozygous deficiency results in neonatal or embryonic lethality in man and mice (for review, see Ref. 3Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Protein C activation occurs on the surface of the endothelium when thrombin binds to thrombomodulin (for review, see Ref. 4Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated protein C (APC)1 generated by this complex then binds to protein S on negatively charged membrane surfaces and inactivates the critical cofactors, factors Va and VIIIa, preventing further thrombin generation. Recently protein C activation has been shown to be augmented by EPCR. Direct binding of protein C to EPCR circumvents the requirement for endothelial cell activation for these cells to support protein C activation effectively (5Xu J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6704-6710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Binding of protein C to EPCR has been shown to be mediated almost entirely by the vitamin K-dependent Gla domain (6Regan L.M. Mollica J.S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26279-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), normally considered to be primarily involved in binding to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces. In addition to binding protein C, EPCR appears to perform other functions. It binds proteinase 3, the autoantigen in Wegener's granulomatosis. This complex then binds to Mac-1 on activated neutrophils (7Kurosawa S. Esmon C.T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4697-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) where it apparently inhibits tight leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelium. The proteinase 3 and protein C binding sites appear to be distinct. Another property of EPCR is that it can translocate from the membrane surface to the nucleus. EPCR shares sequence homology with the major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC class 1) and CD1 family of molecules (8Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, these molecules bind ligands in a deep hydrophobic groove formed by two α-helices that overlie the eight-stranded β-pleated sheet (9Burmeister W.P. Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Blum M.L. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). CD1 molecules can bind lipid antigens and present these antigens to T cells. Like the CD1 molecules, the structure presented here indicates that EPCR has its groove filled with a lipid molecule, but unlike the CD1 molecules, EPCR is missing the α3 domain and does not associate with β2-microglobulin. Mutagenesis studies of EPCR have indicated that protein C binding is mediated at the tip of EPCR and does not involve the groove (10Liaw P.C.Y. Mather T. Oganesyan N. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8364-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). rsEPCR was expressed and purified essentially as described previously (11Fukudome K. Kurosawa S.

Crystals were grown in hanging drops by the vapor diffusion method. Data collection for the native form was performed with a synchrotron x-ray source (National Synchrotron Light Source, X9B) where the crystal diffracted to 2.0 Å and for derivatives was performed on a MAR345 image plate detector (MAR Research, Norderstedt, Hamburg, Germany) mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator (MSC, The Woodlands, TX) and equipped with an Oxford cooling system. The crystals of human rsEPCR belong to the P3121 space group with the cell parameters a = b = 69.6 Å, c = 96.0 Å. The asymmetric unit contains one rsEPCR molecule. The data were processed using the HKL2000 package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The rsEPCR crystal in 6 m sodium formate, TBS, and 0.02% NaN3 was soaked overnight at room temperature with 10−4mK2Pt(SCN)6. Three binding sites were revealed. When the rsEPCR crystal in 4 m sodium formate, TBS, and 0.02% NaN3 was soaked overnight in 10−4m p-chloromercuribenzoate, three derivatized sites were also detected. After solvent flattening and density modification, the phases were used to calculate the electron density map. The electron density was clearly interpretable and allowed placement of 150 consecutive residues. All the calculations were done using CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P.

Protein C was isolated from a vitamin K-dependent protein concentrate (a generous gift from Baxter AG) essentially as described previously (15Taylor F.B., Jr. Chang A. Esmon C.T. D'Angelo A. Vigano-D'Angelo S. Blick K.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). rsEPCR was mixed with protein C at a ratio of 1.1 to 1. The mixture in TBS, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3 was concentrated to 20 mg/ml. The crystallization condition was: 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 5% (v/v) polyethylene glycol. The crystal was washed for 5–10 s in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 22% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400 and then flash cooled on the goniometer head. The resolution limit of the diffraction was about 1.55 Å on the in-house machine. Data were processed using HKL2000. Data statistics are summarized in Table I. The crystal belongs to the P21 space group with cell parameters a = 59.22 Å, b = 62.36 Å, c = 71.03 Å, β = 101.81°. The asymmetric unit contains two complexes. Briefly, rsEPCR was used as a competitor to block the binding of active site fluorescently labeled APC to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (11Fukudome K. Kurosawa S.

Inhibition of APC binding was analyzed by flow cytometry (16Liaw P.C.Y. Neuenschwander P.F. Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5447-5452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). All extraction experiments were performed at room temperature. 1 ml of 2 mg/ml rsEPCR in TBS, 5 mm EDTA was mixed with 100 μl of 10% Triton X-100. After 1 h, 2 ml of 1-butanol/diisopropyl ether (DIPE) (40:60, v/v) was added, and the sample was rocked overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 2 min (17Cham B.E. Knowles B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was removed and washed with pure DIPE to remove possible traces of 1-butanol. The organic phase was evaporated under nitrogen to minimize the possible oxidation of the lipid. The dried organic phase served as the source of lipid for functional reconstitution. The delipidated rsEPCR in the aqueous phase was divided into two 300-μl aliquots. An equal volume of TBS containing 2%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added to each aliquot of rsEPCR. No additions were made to the first aliquot of delipidated rsEPCR. To the second aliquot we added 4 μl of dried lipid extracted from EPCR, and the solution was mixed. The “dried” lipid was a very viscous material that could be pipetted. Tubes were rocked for 2 h at room temperature and then dialyzed overnight against TBS. To help elucidate how EPCR carries out its wide range of functions, we solved the structure of rsEPCR alone and also bound to the Gla domain of protein C. Although the crystal packing environments for the two crystals were very different, there appeared to be little change in the EPCR structure upon binding the protein C Gla domain. Specifically the root mean square disposition between two non-crystallographically related rsEPCR molecules in the presence of the protein C Gla domain was as large as the difference seen between either rsEPCR in that structure or the rsEPCR crystal formed in the absence of the protein C Gla domain (root mean square disposition, 0.4 Å). The only large shift involved the side chain of the Arg156, which moved to open a hydrophobic pocket in EPCR that can accommodate Phe4 of the protein C Gla domain. The overall fold of rsEPCR is similar to the rest of the members of the MHC class 1 and CD1 families (Fig. 1). A groove is formed by two α-helices overlying a β-pleated sheet. In MHC class 1 molecules that bind peptides, the distance between the α-helices is larger than in rsEPCR or CD1d. Although the CD1d x-ray structure has been solved (18Zeng Z.-H. Castano A.R. Segelke B.W. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1997; 277: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), the lipid molecule was not modeled. The rsEPCR and the CD1d molecules were superimposed to compare the lipid binding grooves. The comparison revealed that of 18 residues making contacts between rsEPCR and the lipid molecule, seven are identical, and six residues have similar properties in CD1d (Fig.2). The other five residues are different, but they belong to part of the structure that does not superimpose.Figure 2Stereodiagram showing the EPCR molecule in coil presentation. The lipid molecule, and the residues within 3.5Å of the lipid, are represented in the ball-and-stickpresentation. Superimposition of EPCR and CD1d1 molecules revealed seven identical (shown in black outline) and six similar amino acids (shown in red outline) within the hydrophobic groove that occupy similar positions. Most of the identical residues are clustered around the less curved fatty acid chain, whereas most of the similar ones are around the kinkedchain. Such clustering might be an indication of the different specificity of EPCR and CD1d1 toward fatty acid chains. Prepared using Molscript (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The protein C Gla domain-rsEPCR crystal provided higher resolution data (1.55 Å) than the crystal of rsEPCR (2.0 Å) alone. This higher resolution data allowed us to identify the bound lipid as either phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 1). The fatty acid side chains of the lipid interact with the hydrophobic residues within the groove. The helices cover these fatty acid side chains, apparently restricting solvent access (Fig.3) and perhaps protecting the fatty acids from oxidation. The head group is solvent-exposed compromising exact crystallographic determination. Although crystallization was attempted between rsEPCR and intact protein C, electron density from only the first 33 amino acid residues of protein C could be identified. Positions 42 and 44 in protein C are known to be highly susceptible to cleavage by chymotrypsin-like enzymes. Cleavage at these sites apparently occurred during crystallization. This fortuitous cleavage may have allowed the crystals to form. Binding of protein C to EPCR is Ca2+-dependent. The Ca2+ ions in the protein C Gla domain (shown in magenta in Fig. 1) are clearly visible in the structure. Only one contact is made between the Ca2+ ions bound to the protein C Gla domain and EPCR (residue Glu86 of EPCR) (Fig.4). In addition to coordinating one of the Ca2+ ions, Glu86 is within hydrogen bonding distances from Gla7, Gla25, and Gla29. Other hydrogen bonds between EPCR (first residue) and protein C (second residue) include Gln150 to Gla7, Arg87 to Gla25, and Tyr154 to Gla7. A network of hydrophobic interactions involve Leu82-Gla7, Tyr154-Phe4, Thr157-Phe4, and Leu82-Leu8. The role of calcium is most likely to help stabilize the hydrophobic “ω” loop of protein C where residues Phe4 and Leu8 within this loop contribute the majority of the interactions with EPCR. In addition, the Ca2+ ions bound to protein C may help to position the Gla residues to facilitate hydrogen bonding interactions with EPCR. The direct contribution of the lipid in EPCR to protein C binding seems to be relatively minor. The closest contact is 4.3 Å away from Phe4 of the protein C molecule. However, the fatty acid forms the base of a hydrophobic pocket into which Phe4 is inserted. Interestingly Phe4 and Leu8 of the ω loop in the protein C appear to be required for protein C binding to phospholipid, which is also a Ca2+ion-dependent process (19Christiansen W.T. Jalbert L.R. Robertson R.M. Jhingan A. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10376-10382Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ ions within the Gla domain are in positions very similar to those seen in prothrombin fragment 1 (Protein Data Bank code 2PF2) and factor VIIa (Protein Data Bank code 1DAN). To determine whether the presence of lipid in the groove is important for protein C binding, the lipid from rsEPCR was extracted and reconstituted with the endogenous lipid extract. Each form was tested for its ability to bind APC measured indirectly by the ability of the rsEPCR to inhibit fluorescently labeled APC binding to endothelial cells that express full-length EPCR (11Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J., He, X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our initial studies indicated that the lipid molecule in rsEPCR was very tightly bound since extensive washing in buffer with or without Triton X-100 failed to remove the bound lipid. Compared with native rsEPCR, lipid extraction reduced the ability of EPCR to block activated protein C binding to HUVECs (Fig. 5). The remaining inhibitory activity could be due either to residual bound lipid or partial retention of activated protein C binding activity. Reconstitution of the lipid derived from rsEPCR restored the inhibitory activity. The lipids alone treated by the reconstitution approach had no inhibitory activity (data not shown). The results suggest that the bound lipid is important for rsEPCR-protein C interaction, possibly related to maintaining EPCR structure. Some potentially important biological proposals can be derived from the structure. A model of intact APC can be built by annealing the Gla domain shown in this structure with the remainder of the APC structure (20Mather T. Oganesyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) essentially as described previously (10Liaw P.C.Y. Mather T. Oganesyan N. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8364-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of EPCR would be inserted into the membrane, while activated protein C would bind at nearly the opposite end of EPCR and point away from the membrane surface. This would be predicted to elevate the active site about 35 ± 5 Å further from the membrane than would occur if activated protein C were bound directly to phospholipid. The altered distance of the active site from the membrane surface could favor cleavage of cell surface proteins and might contribute to the observed EPCR dependence of some cell signaling events (21Shu F. Kobayashi H. Fukudome K. Tsuneyoshi N. Kimoto M. Terao T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structure of EPCR helps to explain why it can function without β2-microglobulin and the α3 domain. In CD1 proteins, the α3 domain is positioned on the opposite side of the β-sheet from the ligand binding groove and diagonally opposite to the protein C binding site. The residues in the β-sheet that interact with the α3 domain in CD1d are not conserved in EPCR. Hydrophobic interactions exist between the CD1d β-sheet and β2-microglobulin, which is located between α1α2 and α3 domains. Although EPCR has hydrophobic residues at that region, carbohydrates in that region of EPCR would prevent interaction with β2-microglobulin. Despite its relatively small size, EPCR can bind three ligands simultaneously: proteinase 3, protein C/APC, and phospholipid. The lipid is required for protein C binding, but further characterization of the lipid binding specificity of EPCR and analysis of the role of the lipid in cellular trafficking and EPCR-proteinase 3 interactions remain to be completed. The structure of rsEPCR with its tightly bound phospholipid may provide insights into how CD1 family members bind lipids. Most of the residues contacting the lipid in EPCR are identical or highly conserved in CD1d, suggesting that CD1d binds lipids for antigen presentation in a manner analogous to EPCR. It is tempting to speculate that EPCR may share with CD1d (22Hong S. Scherer D.C. Singh N. Mendiratta S.K. Serizawa I. Koezuka Y. Van Kaer L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 169: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) the ability to present lipid antigens, to play a role in host defense from infection, and perhaps, when compromised, to augment autoimmunity. The latter possibility would be consistent with the observation that anti-phospholipid antibodies associated with thrombosis often have a more dramatic impact on the protein C anticoagulant pathway than on procoagulant complexes (23Esmon N.L. Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given that EPCR-null mice exhibit early embryonic lethality (24Gu J.-M. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2000; 96 (Abstr. 3516): 814aGoogle Scholar), proof of these hypotheses will require improved strategies to acquire viable mice for this analysis. We thank T. Burnett and B. Carpenter for help in protein purification; S. N. Barnard for help in manuscript preparation; and O. Safa, K. Hensley, and X. C. Zhang for helpful discussions."

We examined the effect of Parkin overexpression on cellular levels of oxidative damage, antioxidant defenses, nitric oxide production, and proteasomal enzyme activity. Increasing expression of Parkin by gene transfection in NT-2 and SK-N-MC cells led to increased proteasomal activity, decreased levels of protein carbonyls, 3-nitrotyrosine-containing proteins, and a trend to a reduction in ubiquitinated protein levels. Transfection of these cells with DNA encoding three mutant Parkins associated with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (Del 3–5, T240R, and Q311X) gave smaller increases in proteasomal activity and led to elevated levels of protein carbonyls and lipid peroxidation. Turnover of the mutant proteins was slower than that of the wild-type protein, and both could be blocked by the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. A rise in levels of nitrated proteins and increased levels of NO2−/NO3− was also observed in cells transfected with mutant Parkins, apparently because of increased levels of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase. The presence of mutant Parkin in substantia nigra in juvenile parkinsonism may increase oxidative stress and nitric oxide production, sensitizing cells to death induced by other insults.

Transfection of these cells with DNA encoding three mutant Parkins associated with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (Del 3–5, T240R, and Q311X) gave smaller increases in proteasomal activity and led to elevated levels of protein carbonyls and lipid peroxidation. Turnover of the mutant proteins was slower than that of the wild-type protein, and both could be blocked by the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. A rise in levels of nitrated proteins and increased levels of NO2−/NO3− was also observed in cells transfected with mutant Parkins, apparently because of increased levels of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase. The presence of mutant Parkin in substantia nigra in juvenile parkinsonism may increase oxidative stress and nitric oxide production, sensitizing cells to death induced by other insults.

Consistent with this view, increased levels of oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids and decreased levels of GSH are found in substantia nigra in PD (1Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Ann.

Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP), an early onset form of PD, is characterized by loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurones in substantia nigra pars compacta and locus ceruleus, usually without Lewy body formation (6Ishikawa A. Takahashi H. J. Neurol. 1998; 245 Suppl. 3: P4-P9Crossref Google Scholar). Various mutations (including deletion or point mutations) in the Parkin gene located on chromosome 6 (6q25.2-q27) have been found in AR-JP patients, but no clear correlations exist between types of Parkin mutations and clinical or pathologic features (7Hattori N.

Parkin has been identified as a ubiquitin-protein ligase containing 465 amino acids, which consists of a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain in the N terminus, two ring-finger motifs (termed RING1 and RING2) flanking a Cys-rich domain, named as the in-between RING (IBR) (9Kitada T.

An additional segment is a linker region that connects two regions of UBL and RING1-IBR-RING2 (named as the RING box). Deletional analysis of Parkin revealed that UBL and the linker region are not necessary for association with a specific E2 enzyme. In contrast, the full region of the RING box is necessary for non-covalent association with E2. Therefore, missense mutations in the RING box of Parkin in AR-JP patients have almost completely lost the specific E2-binding activity. 2N. Hattori, S.-I. Kubo, and Y. Mizuno, unpublished data. Thus, mutations in the RING finger motifs such as T240R and T415N could cause a loss of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity due to no recruiting of E2 (15Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In our previous study (16Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N.

The ubiquitin/proteasome system plays an important role in cellular function, e.g. it degrades oxidatively damaged, nitrated, and ubiquitinated proteins (20Grune T. Blasig I.E. Sitte N. Roloff B.

Indeed, decreases in proteasomal enzyme activity as measured by trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolase (PGPH) activities are found in substantia nigra in PD (24McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which mutations in Parkin induce cell death in AR-JP are far from clear, a rise in levels of abnormal proteins due to proteasomal dysfunction may induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and formation of protein aggregates that might be cytotoxic (25Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar, 26Mezey E. Dehejia A. Harta G. Papp M.I. Polymeropoulos M.H. Brownstein M.J. Nat.

In the present study, we investigated how overexpression of wild-type and mutant Parkin proteins (Del 3–5, T240R, and Q311X) modulates proteasomal activity, the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, indices of oxidative stress, nitric oxide production, and antioxidant defenses. We chose two very different cell types, a human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-MC cells (29Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schner M. Freeman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar), and a human teratocarcinoma cell line, NT-2 cells, with cholinergic characteristics (30Angulo A. Suto C. Ghazal P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to examine whether the effects could be reproduced in different cell lines. NT-2, SK-N-MC and their Parkin transfectants were maintained in 100-mm tissue culture plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) containing high glucose-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) under humidified 5% CO2and 95% air. pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-neo, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-wild-type parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-Del 3–4 mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-Del 3–5 mutantparkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-Del 5 mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-R42P mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-K161N mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-K211N mutantparkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-T240R mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-R275W mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-C289G mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-Q311X mutantparkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-R334C mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1 (+)-myc-T415N mutant parkin, pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-G430D mutant parkin and pcDNA3.1(+)-myc-W453X mutant parkin were used. Transfection of these cDNAs into NT-2 and SK-N-MC cell lines was performed as described by Lee et al. (31Lee M. Hyun D.-H. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Lee M. Hyun D.-H. Jenner P. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 (a neomycin analogue, Invitrogen). Twenty clones from each transfectant were selected as stably expressing wild-type or mutant Parkin (Del 3–5, T240R, and Q311X) in both cell lines. After control experiments measuring growth rate and protein expression, 10 clones were chosen, which showed consistent traits as follows: 1) stable protein expression and 2) similar growth rates. For viability tests, four clones were used. For parameters of oxidative stress (levels of GSH and oxidative damage), levels of ubiquitinated proteins, proteasome activity, and enzyme activity, six clones were used. Cells were lysed with a buffer containing 5 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml pepstastin A (Sigma), and 10% SDS (Sigma) and placed on ice for 5 min. The lysates were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatants were transferred into new Eppendorf tubes. Protein levels were measured (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 269-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and a total of 50 μg of protein was then electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for 1.5 h (100 V). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 20 V overnight. The membranes were incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen, Groningen, the Netherlands) for 2 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (1:500 dilution, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. A color reaction was performed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma). The blotting membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to stop the color reaction and then were dried for determining the amount of expressed protein in an image analyzer (Imaging System, St. Catherine, Ontario, Canada). The ubiquitin-protein ligase activity was assessed by measuring formation of ubiquitinated protein. Cell extracts (after lysis using 0.5% Nonidet P-40) were incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing Enzyme E1 (Affiniti Research Products, Exeter, UK), UbcH7 (3 μg, Affiniti Research Products), and free ubiquitin (1 μg, Sigma). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The levels of ubiquitinated proteins were measured as described below. Viability assays (trypan blue exclusion test and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test) were performed as described by Kelner et al. (34Kelner G.S. Lee M. Clark M.E.

Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 μm lactacystin for an appropriate time. Cycloheximide (0.5 μm) was also added to prevent further protein synthesis. Then cells were lysed for Western blotting. Activities of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD2), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase were measured as described by Lee et al. (31Lee M. Hyun D.-H. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GSH level was assessed as described by Hissin and Hilf (35Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar) with 105 cells. This assay detects GSH by its reaction with o-phthalaldehyde at pH 8. A standard curve was made using commercial GSH (Sigma). DNA extraction and assessment of purity were carried out as described by Lyraset al. (36Lyras L. Cairns N.J. Jenner A. Jenner P. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). DNA hydrolysis with formic acid and separation of modified 8-hydroxyguanine by HPLC were performed as described by Kaur and Halliwell (37Kaur H. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 21-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Protein carbonyl content was determined by method A of Lyras et al. (38Lyras L. Evans P.J. Shaw P.J. Ince P.G. Halliwell B. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except that the final protein pellets were dissolved in 1 ml of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. Carbonyl content was calculated as nmol/mg protein (39Reznick A.Z. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 223: 357-363Crossref Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). Measurement of protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine content was carried out as described by Khan et al. (40Khan J. Brennand D.M. Bradley N. Gao B. Bruckdorfer R. Jacobs M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 807-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) was prepared in a quenched flow reaction system (41Yermilov V. Rubio J. Ohshima H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Nitrated bovine serum albumin was prepared as described by Whiteman and Halliwell (42Whiteman M. Halliwell B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The conjugation of horseradish peroxidase with anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody was performed with the periodate method as described by Harlow and Lane (43Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-612Google Scholar). For measuring lipid peroxidation, thiobarbituric acid-reactive material was measured by HPLC as described by Lyras et al. (44Lyras L. Perry R.H. Perry E.K. Ince P.G. Jenner A. Jenner P. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), employing 3 × 106 cells. Levels of NO2−/NO3− and expression of nitric-oxide synthase were measured as described by Lee et al. (31Lee M. Hyun D.-H. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The levels of NO2−/NO3− in medium alone (including fetal bovine serum) were subtracted from the levels of NO2−/NO3− in cells plus medium. The levels of NO2−/NO3− in cells plus medium were 20–25 μm and in medium (plus fetal bovine serum) alone 10–12 μm. Three different proteasome activities were measured as described by Canu et al. (45Canu N. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Serafino A. Dus L. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 589-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using fluorogenic substrates, Suc-LLVY-MCA (50 μm, Sigma), Boc-LRR-MCA (100 μm, Bachem, Merseyside, UK). or Z-LLE-βNap (400 μm, Sigma). Hydrolysis of these substrates was independent of the ubiquitin system. Standard curves were made with 20 S proteasome (Calbiochem) and trypsin (Sigma). Protein ubiquitination was assessed by dot blotting with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognize free ubiquitin and mono-ubiquitinated proteins, as described by Lee et al.(31Lee M. Hyun D.-H. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After cell lysis, the lysates were filtered to remove free ubiquitin (Centricon, molecular weight cut-off 10,000, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The conjugation of alkaline phosphatase with anti-ubiquitin antibody was performed with the periodate method as described by Harlow and Lane (43Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-612Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by densitometry (Imaging System, St. Catherine, Ontario, Canada). Statistical differences were analyzed by one- and two-way ANOVA tests. Trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide data were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA test. Multiple comparisons were performed by the post hoc Bonferroni t test. Overexpression of wild-type or mutant Parkin did not significantly affect the viability of either NT-2 or SK-N-MC cell lines compared with nontransfected cells and vector-only transfectants under normal culture conditions over the time period of our experiments. Expression of wild-type and mutant Parkins in both NT-2 and SK-N-MC cell lines was examined using Western blotting (Fig.1 A). Wild-type and the three mutant Parkin proteins were stably expressed. The ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of Parkin proteins was also assessed. Both NT-2 and SK-N-MC cell lines contained basal levels of the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (Fig. 1 B). Overexpression of wild-type and Del 3–5 mutant Parkins elevated the enzymatic activity 2.5-fold compared with non- or vector-only transfectants. However, the enzyme activity in T240R or Q311X mutant Parkin transfectants was not significantly increased despite increased protein expression (Fig.1 A). The turnover rate of Parkins was examined. The half-life of wild-type Parkin was 7.31 ± 0.54 h, and the turnover could be almost completely blocked by 1 μm lactacystin (Fig.1 C). The mutant proteins turned over less rapidly (half-life 13.78 ± 1.17 h), and this was again blocked by lactacystin. Expression of wild-type or mutant Parkins did not affect activities of antioxidant enzymes, namely Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD2), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase (TableI). However, levels of GSH in cells expressing mutant Parkins measured at 5 days were lowered (p < 0.01). Levels of 8-hydroxyguanine as a biomarker of oxidative damage to DNA (46Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 246-350Google Scholar) were not significantly different in nontransfectants and Parkin transfectants, whether with the mutant or wild-type enzyme (Table II), although there was a trend for a rise with mutant Parkins in both cell types. Protein carbonyl levels were significantly lowered in both cell lines expressing wild-type Parkin (p < 0.01). However, transfection with mutant Parkins produced a significant rise in carbonyls in both cell types (p < 0.01). Lipid peroxidation was measured as the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive material by using an HPLC-based assay to remove interfering chromogens (47Chirico S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Levels of lipid peroxidation were higher in cells expressing mutant Parkins (p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between control cells and wild-type Parkin transfectants. The possible role of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and/or other reactive nitrogen species was assessed by measuring the level of protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine, a biomarker of attack upon proteins by such species (48Halliwell B.

https://openalex.org/W2058720172,"Amplification or overexpression of the HER-2/neu gene in breast cancers is associated with aggressive behavior and resistance to therapeutic regimens. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to therapeutic resistance/survival of HER-2/neu-overexpressing tumor cells have not been well defined. To determine if phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling contributes to cell survival in HER-2/neu-positive breast cancers, we performed immunohistochemical analyses to evaluate expression of HER-2/neu and AKT in a series of 52 breast carcinomas. Elevated expression of HER-2/neu was found to correlate with overexpression of AKT2 protein and activation of AKT kinase. HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines were resistant to apoptosis induced by UV treatment and hypoxia, which was suppressed in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, indicating a link between AKT activation and stress resistance in HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. These observations suggest that AKT signaling augments resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells overexpressing HER-2/neu."

Of about 100,000 different peptides surmised to exist in all of these species, less than 0.02% are well characterized. Scorpion toxins are classified into four groups according to their effects on specific ion channels, such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl−) channels. Voltage-sensitive Na+ channel toxins are long-chain toxins containing 60–70 amino acid residues with four disulfide bridges (4Possani L.D. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Tytgat J. Eur. J.

A subset of short-chain scorpion toxins has been found to interact with the voltage-dependent or Ca2+-activated K+ channels or Cl− channels. Potassium toxins typically contain 31–38 amino acids with three or four disulfide bridges (2Garcia M.L. Hanner M. Knaus H.G. Koch R. Schmalhofer W. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Adv.

H. fulvipes is widely distributed in South India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Much of the research attention on the venom has been directed toward isolation of enzymes and to study the effect of the crude venom in animals (14Ramanaiah M. Parthasarathy P.R. Venkaiah B. Biochem.

Here we report for the first time purification, solution NMR, and functional characterization of a novel toxin, κ-hefutoxin 1, from the venom of H. fulvipes.κ-Hefutoxin 1 is a 22-residue peptide with two disulfide bridges, the shortest scorpion toxin reported so far, and possesses a unique three-dimensional structure and biological activity. Based on the presence of the functional diad (Tyr5 and Lys19), we hypothesized its function as a potassium channel toxin. κ-Hefutoxin 1 indeed blocks the Kv1.3 and Kv1.2 currents and also slows the activation kinetics of Kv1.3 currents, a novel feature of κ-hefutoxin 1, unlike all other scorpion toxins, which are considered solely pore blockers. Alanine mutants of the functional diad (Y5A, K19A, and Y5A/K19A) failed to block the channels, indicating the importance of the functional diad in recognizing the voltage-gated potassium channel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsVenom from H. fulvipes was milked by electrical stimulation as described previously (17Gopalakrishnakone P. Cheah J. Gwee M.C.E. Lab. Animals. 1995; 29: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Prepacked Superdex 30 and Sephasil C18 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Fisher and Fluka Chemika-Biochemika (Buchs, Switzerland), respectively. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and all reagents for the peptide synthesis and sequencing were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Chiba, Japan). Chemicals used for electrophysiological studies were of analytical grade and from Sigma.Purification of κ-Hefutoxinsκ-Hefutoxins were purified from the crude venom by two-step purification procedures of gel filtration followed by reverse α phase HPLC.1 The lyophilized crude venom was applied on to a Superdex 30 Hiload (16/60) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Proteins eluted were monitored at 280 nm. The biologically active fraction (fraction 5) was then applied onto a Sephasil C18 reverse α phase column, equilibrated with trifluoroacetic acid. The bound peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of acetonitrile. Elution was monitored at 215 nm.Electrospray Ionization Mass SpectrometrySamples were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ion spray interface (Sciex, Ontario, Canada). The ion spray voltage was set to 4600 V, and the orifice voltage was set at 30 V. The mass was determined by flow injection analysis at a flow rate of 50 μl/min using Shimadzu 10 AD pumps as the solvent delivery system.N-terminal Amino Acid SequenceThe N-terminal amino acid sequence of the peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 494 pulsed liquid phase sequencer equipped with an on-line 785A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer.Peptide Synthesisκ-Hefutoxin 1 and the three alanine mutants (Y5A κ-hefutoxin 1, K19A κ-hefutoxin 1, and Y5A/K19A κ-hefutoxin 1) were synthesized by solid phase methodology using Fmoc chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer and were purified by HPLC. The purified peptides were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry measurements.Circular Dichroism of Wild-type and Mutant κ-Hefutoxin 1CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter in H2O solution (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) at 20 °C, with a quartz cell of 1-mm path length. The results are expressed as molar ellipticity [θ].NMR Spectroscopy and Structure CalculationNMR spectra of the κ-hefutoxin 1 (5 mm) were recorded on a Bruker DMX 600-MHz spectrometer in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH 4.0 and a temperature of 25 °C. The two-dimensional experiments included TOCSY (18Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1986: 130-199Google Scholar), NOESY (18Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1986: 130-199Google Scholar), DQF-COSY (18Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1986: 130-199Google Scholar), and E-COSY (19Greisinger C. Sorenson O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 479-485Google Scholar) experiments with 4094 data points in thef2 dimension and 512 increments in thef1 dimension over a spectral width corresponding to 12 ppm. Slow exchanging amide protons were identified in a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra following the dissolution of the toxin in D2O at 25 °C (pH 4.0).The structure of κ-hefutoxin 1 was calculated based on distance restraints derived from the NOESY spectra collected in 90% H2O, 10% D2O with a mixing time of 200 ms using X-PLOR version 3.85. The backbone dihedral angle restraints derived from 3JNHαH coupling constants (20Pardi A. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and the χ1 dihedral angles derived from E-COSY spectra (21Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.P. Schaumann T., Go, N. Wuthrich K.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref Scopus (636) Google Scholar) were used as additional constraints for the structure calculation. The structures were calculated using the standard simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols.Oocyte ExpressionThe three Kv1 type channels studied were respectively from rats (Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels) and humans (Kv1.3 channels).Kv1.1For in vitro transcription, plasmids were first linearized with PstI (New England Biolabs) 3′ to the 3′-nontranslated β-globin sequence in our custom made high expression vector for oocytes, pGEMHE (22Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), and then transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and a cap analogue, diguanosine triphosphate (Promega, Madison, WI).Kv1.2The cDNA encoding Kv1.2 (originally termed RCK5) in its original vector, pAKS2, was first subcloned into pGEM-HE (22Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The insert was released by double restriction digest withBglII and EcoRI. The cDNA was loaded onto an agarose gel, fragments of interest were cut, cleaned (Qiagen, CA), and ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEM-HE. For in vitro transcription, the cDNA was linearized with SphI and transcribed using the large scale T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit (Ambion).Kv1.3The plasmid pCI.neo containing the gene for Kv1.3 was linearized with NotI (New England Biolabs) and transcribed like Kv1.2. Stage V-VI Xenopus laevisoocytes were isolated by partial ovariectomy under anesthesia (tricaine; 1 g/liter). Anesthetized animals were then kept on ice during dissection. The oocytes were defolliculated by treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) in calcium-free ND-96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHepes, pH 7.5, supplemented with 50 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate). Between 2 and 24 h after defolliculation, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 1–100 ng/μl cRNA. The oocytes were then incubated in ND-96 solution at 18 °C for 1–4 days.ElectrophysiologyWhole-cell currents from oocytes were recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Voltage and current electrodes (0.4–2 megaohms) were filled with 3 m KCl. Current records were sampled at 5-ms intervals after low pass filtering at 0.1 kHz. Linear components of capacity and leak currents were not subtracted. All experiments were performed at room temperature (19–23 °C). Steady-state blockade of the toxin was measured at the end of the test pulses at different test potentials by stepping from a holding potential of −90 mV. Fitted Kd values were obtained after calculating the percentage of current left over after application of several toxin concentrations in different oocyte experiments (mean ± S.E., n).DISCUSSIONScorpion venom contains a mixture of polypeptide toxins that affects the physiology of various ion channels. κ-Hefutoxin 1 purified from H. fulvipes venom is 22 amino acids long packed by two disulfide bridges. The toxin bears no sequence homology to any known toxins reported so far, which interested us in studying its structure and function. Solution NMR data revealed that κ-hefutoxin 1 adopts a unique three-dimensional fold of two parallel α-helices held together by two disulfide bridges and separated by a loop with no evidence of β-sheets. All known scorpion toxins possess a highly conserved three-dimensional arrangement comprising double- or triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a stretch of α-helix maintained by a couple of disulfide bridges (4Possani L.D. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar,12Possani L.D. Merino E. Corona M. Bolivar F. Becerril B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).Protein toxins bind to receptors/acceptors with high specificity. In general, only a small number of critical residues contribute to these protein-protein interactions (30Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J-C.

In addition, proteins that bind to the same site of a receptor/acceptor protein share similar structural features. Such a structural convergence in functional sites is well exemplified among toxins that interact with voltage-gated potassium channels. As shown in Fig.6A, these potassium channel toxins isolated from the venoms of snake, scorpion, spider, sea anemone, and cone snail have distinctly different three-dimensional structures. However, these toxins possess a diad, consisting of a lysine and a hydrophobic residue (mostly Phe or Tyr), that is fully exposed from a flat surface and plays a critical role in their interaction with voltage-gated K+ channels (31Stampe P.

Despite their differences in the protein folding, the conserved diads are superimposable, and the average distance between the lysine α-carbon and the center of the aromatic ring of the hydrophobic residue was ∼6.52 ± 0.62 Å (Fig. 6, B and C). Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that the diad is critical for toxin-channel interaction (33Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C.L.

Interestingly, in κ-hefutoxin 1, Tyr5 and Lys19 protrude out of the flat surface formed by the edges of the two parallel α-helices. The average distance between the lysine α-carbon and the center of the aromatic ring of tyrosine in the 20 conformers was 6.0 ± 1.0 Å. This diad was superimposable with the critical diads of other potassium channel toxins (Fig. 6C). Therefore, we predicted that κ-hefutoxin 1 might be a new class of potassium channel toxin with different topography.κ-Hefutoxin 1 was found to block the Kv1.3 voltage-gated K+-channel, and it also modifies the gating kinetics. Indeed, all known potassium channel toxins, except for hanatoxin from the tarantula Grammostola spatulata (37Takahashi H. Kim J.I. Sato K. Swartz K.J. Shimada I. Min H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and to some extent dendrotoxin K from the elapid Dendroaspis polylepis polylepis (38Brian R. David O. John S. Carolynn B. Claire N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), merely block these channels by physically plugging the pore without affecting the kinetics of channel gating. In the case of hanatoxin, channel inhibition and gating modification seem to result exclusively from the interaction with the voltage-sensing domains of the potassium channel. As a consequence, the midpoint (V12) of the Boltzmann steady-state activation curve is shifted to more depolarized potentials (39Li-Smerin Y. Swartz K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8590-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). With κ-hefutoxin 1, a voltage-independent modification of the gating kinetics was favored (in a final, voltage-independent step before opening of the channel).Mutational AnalysisTo determine the structure-function relationships and the role of critical diad, three mutants were synthesized in which lysine and tyrosine were substituted by alanine: Y5A, K19A, and Y5A/K19A. Although there may be local structural difference around replaced residues, we consider that the mutation did not affect the overall conformation of κ-hefutoxin 1 (Fig.7A). Minor differences observed in the CD spectra of κ-hefutoxin 1 and its mutants (Y5A and Y5A/K19A) could be attributed to the contribution of the phenolic side chain of Tyr5. It is well documented that losses of aromatic side chains affect significantly the CD spectra of peptides/proteins (40Kim J.I. Ohtake A. Sato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All three mutants, despite having similar conformation failed to reduce the K+ current of Kv1.3 and Kv1.2 channels (Fig. 7, B and C). These results support the importance of Tyr5 and Lys19 in the mechanism of action of κ-hefutoxin 1 in its potassium channel activity. Except for the lack of affinity on two-pore background K+ channels (TASK-1), the pacemaker channel (HCN2) and hH1 Na+ channels, 2K. N. Srinivasan, I. Huys, T. Sasaki, K. Sato, J. Tytgat, H. J.

These results provide a strong impetus to structure-based recognition of biological function of newly discovered proteins in the postgenomic era. Scorpions, the largest arachnids, are among the oldest (more than 450 million years) living groups of animals (1Loret E.P. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Mansuelle P. Sampieri F. Granier C. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There are ∼1500 distinct species of scorpions around the world, and their venoms are rich sources of toxins that affect the ion channel functions of excitable and nonexcitable cells (2Garcia M.L.

Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Of about 100,000 different peptides surmised to exist in all of these species, less than 0.02% are well characterized. Scorpion toxins are classified into four groups according to their effects on specific ion channels, such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl−) channels. Voltage-sensitive Na+ channel toxins are long-chain toxins containing 60–70 amino acid residues with four disulfide bridges (4Possani L.D. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). A subset of short-chain scorpion toxins has been found to interact with the voltage-dependent or Ca2+-activated K+ channels or Cl− channels. Potassium toxins typically contain 31–38 amino acids with three or four disulfide bridges (2Garcia M.L. Hanner M. Knaus H.G. Koch R. Schmalhofer W. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 17: 425-471Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3Tytgat J. Chandy G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Physiol.

Recently, a 23-residue toxin closely packed by three disulfide bridges was purified from the scorpion Tityus cambridgei and was reported to block reversibly the Shaker B K+ channels (7Batista C.V. Gomez-Lagunas F. Lucas S. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two scorpion peptides have been reported to modify the binding of ryanodine to Ca2+ channels. Imperatoxin A, which is 33 amino acids long, increases the binding of ryanodine (8Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Arévalo C. Sreekumar R. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), resulting in continuous Ca2+ channel stimulation. Imperatoxin I is a heterodimer (104 and 27 amino acids, respectively) that blocks Ca2+ channel by inhibition of ryanodine binding (9Zamudio F.Z. Conde R. Arévalo C. Becerril B. Martin B.M.

Scorpion toxins that inhibit Cl−channels are ∼36 amino acids long with four disulfide bridges (10Lippens G. Najib J. Wodak S.J. Tartar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,11Debin J.A. Maggio J.E. Strichartz G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C361-C369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scorpion toxins possess a highly conserved secondary structure arrangement comprising double- or triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a stretch of α-helix maintained by a couple of disulfide bridges (4Possani L.D. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 12Possani L.D. Merino E. Corona M. Bolivar F. Becerril B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Heterometrus fulvipes, also known as the Asian forest black scorpion, belongs to the family Scorpionidae, members of which are reported to be less lethal than the scorpions belonging to the Buthidae family, which include the Indian red scorpionMesobuthus tamulus, the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch, and the Israeli scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus (13Gwee M.C.E. Gopalakrishnakone P. Cheah L.S. Wong P.T.H. Gong J.P. Kini R.M. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1996; 15: 37-57Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). H. fulvipes is widely distributed in South India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Much of the research attention on the venom has been directed toward isolation of enzymes and to study the effect of the crude venom in animals (14Ramanaiah M. Parthasarathy P.R. Venkaiah B. Biochem. Int. 1990; 20: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar, 15Venkaiah B. Parthasarathy P.R. Biochem. Int. 1983; 7: 235-239PubMed Google Scholar, 16Venkateswarlu D. Babu K.S. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1977; 15: 1056-1058PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of neurotoxins that interacts with ion channel function has not been reported so far. Here we report for the first time purification, solution NMR, and functional characterization of a novel toxin, κ-hefutoxin 1, from the venom of H. fulvipes. κ-Hefutoxin 1 is a 22-residue peptide with two disulfide bridges, the shortest scorpion toxin reported so far, and possesses a unique three-dimensional structure and biological activity. Based on the presence of the functional diad (Tyr5 and Lys19), we hypothesized its function as a potassium channel toxin. κ-Hefutoxin 1 indeed blocks the Kv1.3 and Kv1.2 currents and also slows the activation kinetics of Kv1.3 currents, a novel feature of κ-hefutoxin 1, unlike all other scorpion toxins, which are considered solely pore blockers. Alanine mutants of the functional diad (Y5A, K19A, and Y5A/K19A) failed to block the channels, indicating the importance of the functional diad in recognizing the v"

InEscherichia coli this enzyme, encoded by thefadD gene, is required for the coupled import and activation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids. The E. coli FACS (FadD) contains two sequence elements, which comprise the ATP/AMP signature motif (213YTGGTTGVAKGA224and 356GYGLTE361) placing it in the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes. A series of site-directed mutations were generated in the fadD gene within the ATP/AMP signature motif site to evaluate the role of this conserved region to enzyme function and to fatty acid transport. This approach revealed two major classes of fadD mutants with depressed enzyme activity: 1) those with 25–45% wild type activity (fadDG216A, fadDT217A, fadDG219A, and fadDK222A) and 2) those with 10% or less wild-type activity (fadDY213A, fadDT214A, and fadDE361A). Using anti-FadD sera, Western blots demonstrated the different mutant forms of FadD that were present and had localization patterns equivalent to the wild type. The defect in the first class was attributed to a reduced catalytic efficiency although several mutant forms also had a reduced affinity for ATP. The mutations resulting in these biochemical phenotypes reduced or essentially eliminated the transport of exogenous long-chain fatty acids. These data support the hypothesis that the FACS FadD functions in the vectorial movement of exogenous fatty acids across the plasma membrane by acting as a metabolic trap, which results in the formation of acyl-CoA esters.

InEscherichia coli the FACS FadD is hypothesized to catalyze the activation of long-chain fatty acid to CoA thioesters concomitant with transport by a process termed vectorial esterification (16Black P.N. Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 305S-309SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The concerted activities of FadD and the outer membrane fatty acid transport protein FadL essentially render the process of fatty acid transport unidirectional. The seminal work of Overath and colleagues (18Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) showed that FACS activity was found both within the membrane and soluble fractions suggesting that this enzyme moves between the cytosol and plasma membrane to facilitate the vectorial esterification of exogenous fatty acids. Indeed, subsequent studies have suggested that the enzyme is recruited to the plasma membrane, but no information has been amassed on the underlying mechanism (19Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The membrane association of FadD may be similar to that of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, an enzyme required for phospholipid biosynthesis that is catalytically active in the membrane and inactive when soluble (20Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5686-5692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FACS catalyzes the formation of fatty acyl-CoA by a two-step process that proceeds through the hydrolysis of ATP to yield pyrophosphate. One of the key features of this catalysis is the formation of an adenylated intermediate (21Groot P.H. Scholte H.R. Hulsmann W.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1976; 14: 75-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation step involves the linking of the carboxyl group of the fatty acid through an acyl bond to the phosphoryl group of AMP. Subsequently a transfer of the fatty acyl group to the sulfhydryl group of coenzyme A occurs releasing AMP. By analogy with acetyl-CoA synthetase, it is likely this reaction precedes via a Bi-Uni, Uni-Bi Ter-molecular ping-pong mechanism with fatty acid, ATP, and CoA all serving as substrates (22Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 173-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fatty acid+ATP⇒fatty acyl−AMP+PPi(Eq. 1) Fatty acyl­AMP+CoA⇒fatty acyl­CoA+AMP(Eq. 2) The formation of an enzyme-bound adenylated intermediate is a common mechanism used by a number of enzymes to activate their substrates. Sequence comparisons of adenylate-forming enzymes have identified two highly conserved sequence elements (YTSGTTGXPKGV and GYGXTE) that comprise the ATP/AMP signature motif (24Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first sequence is generally 125–130 residues upstream from the second. A third less-conserved element that is thought to contribute to ATP/AMP binding overlaps the FACS signature (70–75 residues downstream from the second), which we have shown is involved in both catalysis and specificity of the fatty acid substrate (25Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The focus of the present work was to identify specific residues within the ATP/AMP signature critical for function and to further investigate the role of this enzyme in the process of long-chain fatty acid transport. A series of alanine substitutions were generated in the region of FadD corresponding to the ATP/AMP signature motif site. Subsequent analyses of the mutant forms of the enzyme permitted classification into three groups. Those with wild-type or nearly wild-type levels of oleoyl-CoA synthetase activity, those with oleoyl-CoA synthetase activities reduced 40–80% when compared with wild-type, and those with essentially undetectable levels of oleoyl-CoA synthetase activity. Several of the altered forms of the enzyme with detectable oleoyl-CoA synthetase activity had reduced catalytic rates as opposed to a reduction in affinity for ATP attesting to the importance of this highly conserved region for catalysis. Substitutions within the ATP/AMP signature motif of FadD, which resulted in depressed FACS activities also had depressed fatty acid transport levels. These data support the notion the membrane-associated fatty acyl-CoA synthetase FadD plays a central role in the transmembrane movement and metabolic activation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids in E. coli. The bacterial strains used in this study were: BMH 71-18 (thi supEΔ(lac proAB) mutS::Tn10[F′ proAB lacIqZΔM15]), JM109 (endA1 relA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 (rK−, mK+) relA supE44 a Δ(lacproAB) [F′ traD36proAB lacIqZΔM15]), LS6928 (fadR fadD88zea::Tn10), LS1547 (prototrophic wild-type), LS1548 (ΔfadR), LS1908 (ΔfadR fadD::Kanr), LS6952 (recBC), and BL21 (λDE3)/pLysS. Strain LS1908 was constructed by replacing the coding region of fadD with the kanamycin resistance gene cartridge (Kanr;Amersham Biosciences) using a two-step process. First, the coding region of fadD in pN300 (24Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was deleted and replaced by the Kanr cartridge thereby maintaining >500 bp of flanking DNA to generate pJW201. Second, this plasmid was digested with BamHI to generate a linear DNA molecule, transformed into strain LS6952 and movement ofΔfadD::Kanr by P1 transduction into strain LS1548 to generate the ΔfadR ΔfadD::Kanr strain LS1908. ThefadD deletion in LS1908 was confirmed by PCR of chromosomal DNA using primers specific to bacterial DNA flanking the deletion and by a loss of acyl-CoA synthetase activity. Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C in a gyratory shaker in Luria broth or tryptone broth (TB). When minimal media was required, medium E supplemented with vitamin B1 (EB1) was used (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Carbon sources, sterilized separately, were added to final concentrations of 25 mm glucose, 25 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm decanoate, or 5 mm oleate. When oleate or decanoate were used as a carbon source, polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether (Brij 58) was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. As required, amino acids were added to a final concentration of 0.01%. When required to maintain plasmids, antibiotics were added to 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml kanamycin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, and 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Growth of bacterial cultures was routinely monitored using a Klett-SummersonTM colorimeter equipped with a blue filter. Protein sequence comparisons were performed using MultAlign version 5.3.3 (27Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar) with sequences that were conserved among the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases or members of the adenylate forming superfamily. Sequence comparisons were directed against the SWIS-PROT data base using a 0.01 probability threshold with complexity filtering and blosum62 score table. Site-directed mutations within the fadD gene were generated using the Altered SitesTM mutagenesis system from Promega as previously described (28Black P.N. Zhang Q. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Specific mutations were confirmed using dideoxysequencing and fadD-specific oligonucleotides (24Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once the mutation was confirmed, BamHI orSacII-SalI fragments containing the differentfadD alleles were purified and ligated into pACYC177. The designations of the final constructions are given in Table I. The plasmid constructs were then transformed into the host strain LS1908 (ΔfadRΔfadD::Kanr) for analysis.Table ISite-directed fadD mutations within the ATP/AMP-binding signature, corresponding mutagenic oligonucleotides, and pACYC177 derivativesfadD alleleMutagenic oligonucleotide sequencePlasmid designationfadDY213ATTCTGCAAGCCACCGGCGpNJW108fadDT214ATGCAATACGCCGGCGGCpNJW109fadDG216ACACCGGCGCCACCACTGpNJW111fadDT217ACCGGCGGCGCCACTGGTpNJW112fadDG219ACACCACTGCTGTGGCGpNJW114fadDK222AGTGTGGCGGCAGGCGCGApNJW115fadDE361AGGCCTTACCGCGTGTGCGCCGpN3551 Open table in a new tab Strain BL21 (λDE3)(pLysS) was transformed with plasmid pN3576 encoding the bacterial fatty acyl-CoA synthetase FadD containing a hexameric histidine tag (25Black P.N.

The expression and purification of His6FadD has been previously described (25Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 90 min and the enzyme was purified from a clarified cell extract using Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen). The His-tagged enzyme elutes as a single band between 250 and 300 mm imidazole. Antisera were prepared against purified FadD using a commercial vendor (BioWorld, Dublin, OH). SelectedfadD alleles were subcloned as cassettes into pN3576 for expression and purification of mutant forms of the enzyme as detailed under “Results.” Western blotting of cell extracts from wild-type and ΔfadD strains transformed with the plasmid constructs harboring the different fadD alleles was performed as previously described (30Kumar G.B. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15469-15476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly total cellular protein or isolated membrane and cytosolic fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (pore size, 0.45 μm) (Micron Separations Inc.). Following transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were pretreated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking in 5% powdered milk + 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TTBS; 20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5). Following this blocking step, anti-FadD sera (1:25,000 dilution) was added directly and incubated an additional hour. Membranes were washed with TTBS three times and subsequently incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:7,500) in 5% powdered milk + TTBS for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in TTBS as detailed above and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL;Amersham Biosciences) or by the addition of the peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidene as specified by the vendor (Promega). The soluble and particulate fractions of cells containing the differentfadD alleles were separated and probed for FadD and mutant forms of FadD using Western blots and anti-FadD sera. Briefly, cells were grown as detailed above and lysed using a French pressure cell at 12,000 p.s.i. The cell lysates were clarified to remove unbroken cells and the supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation (60,000 × g for 30 min; TLA-100 rotor) to separate the membrane (particulate) fraction from the cytosolic fraction. The membranes were resuspended and centrifugation repeated. The protein concentrations of the membrane and cytosolic fractions were adjusted to 8–10 μg/10 μl and analyzed by Western blots as detailed above. The distribution between the membrane and cytosolic fractions of the mutant forms of FadD were compared with those from wild-type FadD. FACS activity was monitored using a modification of a protocol defined by Kameda and Nunn (29Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared from wild-typefadD strains by sonication on ice as previously described (25Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were added to reaction mixtures containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μm[3H]oleate, 0.5 mm coenzyme A and incubated 10 min at 37 °C. For the kinetic experiments the concentration of ATP was varied between 0.05 and 2.5 mm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of CoA and terminated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, n-heptane, 1 mH2SO4 (40:10:1). The aqueous phase, containing acyl-CoA formed during the reaction, was extracted 3 times with 2.5 ml of n-heptane and subjected to scintillation counting. Oleate transport was measured as previously described (30Kumar G.B. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15469-15476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following growth to mid-log phase (5 × 108 cells/ml) in TB, cells were harvested, washed once with minimal media EB1, and resuspended in EB1 containing 0.5% Brij 58 and 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were starved for an exogenous energy source with aeration for 30 min at 30 °C. Following this starvation period, 1 ml of cells was added to 1 ml of an assay mixture containing 200 μm [3H]oleate (potassium salt). At appropriate time points (t = 0, 2, and 4 min), duplicate aliquots (100 μl) were rapidly pipetted onto prewetted GN-6 filters (Gelman), washed twice with EB1 containing 0.5% Brij 58, air-dried, and counted. Results were expressed as picomole of oleate transported/min/mg of cell protein. For the kinetic experiments on selected fadD mutant alleles, the final concentration of oleate was varied (10–100 μm) in the reaction mixture. The values presented from the transport experiments represent the means (±S.E) from at least three independent experiments. All transport data were subjected to analysis of variance using StatView (Abacus Concepts, Inc.). [3H]Oleic acid and [α-35S]dATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]Decanoate was obtained from Sigma. Enzymes for routine DNA manipulations were obtained from Promega, Invitrogen, or New England Biolabs. Antibiotics and other supplements for bacterial growth were obtained from Difco and Sigma. All other chemicals were obtained from standard suppliers and were of reagent grade. One of the key features of the catalytic mechanism of FACS is the formation of an adenylated intermediate (21Groot P.H. Scholte H.R. Hulsmann W.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1976; 14: 75-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation step involves the linking of the carboxyl group of the fatty acid to the phosphoryl group of AMP and subsequent transfer of the acyl chain to the acceptor molecule coenzyme A. The formation of an enzyme-bound adenylated intermediate was a common mechanism used by a number of enzymes to activate their substrates. Sequence comparisons of enzymes, which share this catalytic property, identified two highly conserved sequence elements that comprise the ATP/AMP-binding signature motif (Fig.1). Within the family of adenylate forming enzymes there was a third sequence element of this signature that was less well conserved and partially overlaps the FACS signature motif (25Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the E. coli FACS FadD, the two regions comprising the ATP/AMP signature have been identified on the basis of sequence similarities as213YTGGTTGVAKGA224 and356GYGLTE361. The homologies noted above served to guide studies using site-directed mutagenesis to define whether this region of FACS was essential for enzyme activity. Based on data from other adenylate-forming enzymes, the two highly conserved sequence elements contribute to a region of the enzyme hypothesized to be required for ATP binding and catalysis. A number of specific amino acid residues within the ATP/AMP signature motif were substituted with alanine to assess their contribution to enzymatic activity (Fig. 1, Table I). Western blots using anti-FadD sera demonstrated the protein levels of wild-type FadD and the mutant forms of FadD were equivalent (Fig. 2). These data support the notion that the mutant forms of FadD were expressed at levels approximating the wild type and there was no indication the proteins had reduced stability compared with the wild type. FadD was found in both the soluble and particulate fractions of the bacterial cell (18Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 29Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we monitored the levels of FadD and mutant forms of FadD in both the soluble and particulate fractions using Western blots and found no discernable changes in patterns indicating that amino acid substitutions within the ATP/AMP signature did not result in an enzyme with altered cellular localization (Table II). As the specific amino acids targeted for substitution were postulated to reside within the catalytic center of the enzyme, it seems likely that subtle conformational changes will result that cannot be detected using these methods. Whereas the anti-FadD sera was prepared using highly purifiedHis6FadD, two additional proteins were recognized, which are likely to be other adenylate-forming enzymes that share epitopes in common with FadD (Fig. 2). One of these was likely to be the undefined open reading frame designated YDID, which encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase-like protein that was 30% identical to FadD. YDID does not, however, contribute long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity. 2P. Black and C.

Open table in a new tab This work was driven by the hypothesis that the ATP/AMP signature sequence elements were required for ATP binding and the formation of the adenylated intermediate. FACS activities were monitored in whole cell extracts using oleate (C18:1) and decanoate (C10:0) as substrates in the ΔfadD strain LS1908 transformed with pN300 (wild-type fadD), the plasmid vector pACYC177 and plasmids encoding the collection of fadD alleles (Table II). The alleles fadDY213A, fadDT214A, fadDG216A, fadDT217A, fadDG219A, and fadDK222A (within the first sequence element of the signature) and fadDE361A (within the second element) had markedly reduced enzymatic activities using oleate as the fatty acid substrate. As with our previous studies describing the FACS signature motif (25Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the present studies also revealed two major classes of mutants with depressed enzyme activity: 1) those with 25–45% wild type activity (fadDG216A, fadDT217A, fadDG219A, and fadDK222A) and 2) those with 10% or less wild-type activity (fadDY213A, fadDT214A, and fadDE361A) (Table II). Given that these mutant forms of FadD were expressed at wild-type levels and had the same localization patterns, these data would argue that these residues were crucial for catalytic activity. The data presented above indicated that specific residues within the ATP/AMP signature were important for enzymatic activity. To investigate this further, kinetic studies were undertaken to specifically evaluate the role of ATP in catalysis (Table III, Fig.3). We suspected that several of thefadD mutants with substitutions within the ATP/AMP signature would be defective for ATP binding and thus would have a significantly higher Km for ATP when compared with the wild-type enzyme. As shown in Fig. 3, the fadDY213A and fadDE361A alleles resulted in enzymes with no measurable activity over a range of ATP concentrations. FadDY213A may be defective in ATP binding as is the case for the comparable residue in the mammalian fatty acid transport protein FATP1, which also was a member of the adenylate-forming family of enzymes (31Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M.

By comparison with the phenylalanine activating subunit (PheA) of gramicidin synthetase in Bacillus brevis, Glu361 was essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The homologous amino acid in PheA was a glutamate, which appears to function in concert with a neighboring tyrosine to coordinate the binding of Mg2+-AMP (33Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In this regard, Glu361 may specifically contribute to ATP binding.Table IIIKinetic properties of selected forms of FadD containing substitutions in the ATP/AMP signature using ATP as the variable substrateFACSKinetic parameters3-aKinetic constants (Km and Vmax) defined using the Lineweaver-Burk equation.Vmax3-bNanomole of oleoyl-CoA formed/min/mg of protein.Km3-cMillimolar ATP.kcat3-dSecond−1.kcat/Km3-eMillimole−1 second−1.FadD22.510.130.0290.223FadDY213A0.06<000FadDT214A2.240.130.0030.023FadDG216A5.520.110.0080.073FadDT217A6.100.530.0080.015FadDG219A13.030.060.0170.283FadDK222A7.710.440.0080.018FadDE361A0.03<0003-a Kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) defined using the Lineweaver-Burk equation.3-b Nanomole of oleoyl-CoA formed/min/mg of protein.3-c Millimolar ATP.3-d Second−1.3-e Millimole−1 second−1. Open table in a new tab Three different fadD alleles (fadDT214A, fadDG216A and fadDG219A) resulted in enzyme activities that had kcat values 2–15-fold lower than wild-type, whereas the Km values for ATP were relatively unchanged. This suggests that the primary role of these residues were for catalysis as opposed to ATP binding. Two other alleles (fadDT217A and fadDK222A) affected both Km and kcat. Both mutants had kcat values that were reduced nearly 4-fold and Km values that were increased when compared with the wild type. These results were consistent with the notion that these two residues contribute to ATP binding. On the basis of previous work on PheA, the positive charge on the comparable lysine residue was thought to function by directing ATP to the binding site (33Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar).

Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This matrix is synthesized in a highly regulated fashion (2Weber K.T. Sun Y. Katwa L.C. Herz. 1995; 20: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar), and once assembled, it serves as a framework to maintain tissue architecture and house resident cells. Changes in ECM composition can alter matrix structure and consequently modify matrix-matrix and matrix-cell interactions, impairing organ function (3Fonseca C. Abraham D. Black C.M. Springer Semin.

To prevent as well as improve the treatment and management of fibrotic conditions, it is necessary to identify matrix components, establish their interactions with one another and resident cells, and ascertain changes in the ECM that occur as a consequence of specific pathological conditions. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-inducible gene-h3 (βig-h3) is a matrix component originally obtained from fetal bovine nuchal ligament by reductive saline extraction (designated MP78) (6Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hypothesized to be a microfibrillar protein. More recently, βig-h3 was cloned from TGF-β-stimulated A549 cells (7Skonier J. Neubauer M. Madisen L. Bennett K. Plowman G.D. Purchio A.F.

Several studies have revealed that βig-h3 is a widely expressed component of the ECM in a number of organ systems where it associates with other matrix macromolecules. In bovine tissues, βig-h3 was found with collagen fibers in developing nuchal ligament, aorta, lung, and mature cornea (11Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was also present in capsule and tubule basement membranes of developing kidney and reticular fibers in fetal spleen. We recently reported that βig-h3 is expressed by primary human lung and bladder smooth muscle cells and fibroblast cells in vitrowhere it is secreted into the culture medium and incorporated in the matrix (12Billings P.C.

In human tissue, the protein is deposited in the matrix surrounding individual smooth muscle cells in the bladder detrusor (13Billings P.C. Herrick D.J. Kucich U. Engelsberg B.N. Macarak E.J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Howard P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in septal tips of alveolar ducts, and in the walls of alveoli and bronchioles in lung (12Billings P.C. Herrick D.J. Howard P.S. Kucich U. Engelsberg B.N. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alterations in βig-h3 have been directly linked to human disease. Mutations in the coding region of βig-h3 have been identified in patients with hereditary corneal dystrophies (14Munier F.L. Korvatska E. Djemai A., Le Paslier D. Zografos L. Pescia G. Schorderet D.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15 (, 247–251): 224-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). These mutations map to positions 124 (Arg → Cys or His) and 555 (Arg → Gln or Trp) and are believed to cause the protein to denature, resulting in the formation of amyloidogenic intermediates that eventually precipitate (14Munier F.L. Korvatska E. Djemai A., Le Paslier D. Zografos L. Pescia G. Schorderet D.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15 (, 247–251): 224-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15Klintworth G.K. Valnickova Z.

At the present time, it is not known whether these mutations produce other clinical manifestations in addition to their effect on vision. Kim et al. (16Kim J.E. Kim E.H. Han E.H. Park R.W. Park I.H. Jun S.H. Kim J.C. Young M.F. Kim I.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) demonstrated that βig-h3 is down-regulated in melorheostosis, a rare disorder characterized by hyperostosis. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous βig-h3 to osteoblasts in culture inhibited bone nodule formation, suggesting that it plays a direct role in osteogenesis (16Kim J.E. Kim E.H. Han E.H. Park R.W. Park I.H. Jun S.H. Kim J.C. Young M.F. Kim I.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, periostin, which is closely related to βig-h3, is expressed by TGF-β-stimulated primary osteoblast cells and supports cell attachment and spreading in vitro (17Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M. Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In tissue, periostin localizes to the periosteum and periodontal ligament and is speculated to play a role in the adherence of osteoblast precursor cells in the periosteum (17Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M. Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Consequently, in addition to being a structural component of the ECM, βig-h3 and its relatives may regulate bone production by osteoblasts. Although the precise physiological function of βig-h3 is not known, it has been suggested that it interconnects different matrix components and resident cells (11Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S.

In this report, we demonstrate that βig-h3 supports cell attachment and spreading, induces actin stress fiber formation, and binds fibronectin, an abundant glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix. Affi-Gel-10 affinity chromatography support was purchased from Bio-Rad. Renaissance chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, purified human fibronectin (FN), FN proteolytic fragments, and toluidine blue were purchased from Sigma. Novex SDS-polyacrylamide minigels, oligonucleotide primers, and Sf-900 serum-free insect cell culture medium were supplied by Invitrogen. Talon cobalt affinity chromatography resin was obtained from CLONTECH. BA-85 nitrocellulose membranes were supplied by Schleicher & Schuell. SP-Sepharose cation exchange resin was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-βig-h3 antibodies 1073 and 1077 were developed in rabbits against synthetic peptides present in the N- and C-terminal regions of human βig-h3 and affinity-purified as described previously (12Billings P.C. Herrick D.J. Howard P.S. Kucich U. Engelsberg B.N. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For immobilization, anti-βig-h3 antibody 1077 and preimmune rabbit IgG were covalently attached to Affi-Gel-10 support resin following the protocols recommended by the manufacturer. Proteins were resolved on Novex 8–16% polyacrylamide gradient gels under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (12Billings P.C. Herrick D.J. Howard P.S. Kucich U.

After transfer, the membranes were blocked in PBST and 5% nonfat dry milk and subsequently incubated with anti-βig-h3 antibodies diluted 1:2000 in PBST, 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Bound antibody was detected with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate and developed with chemiluminescence or chloronaphthol substrate. Recombinant βig-h3 was expressed using the BV system employing established protocols (for review see Ref. 18Willis S.H. Peng C. Ponce de Leon M. Nicola A.V. Rux A.H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Brown S.M. MacLean A.R. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Herpes Simplex Virus Protocols. 10. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 131-156Google Scholar). The cDNA containing the entire open reading frame for βig-h3 (encompassing amino acid residues 24–683, the sequence of the full-length secreted protein) was amplified by PCR. The forward and reverse primers were (for 24/Bcl1) 5′-GGCATGA TCAT GGT CCC GCC AAG TCG CC-3′ and (rev 683/SstI) 5′-GGCAGAGCTCCTA GTG GTG ATG ATG GTG ATG CTT CAT CCT CTC TAA TAA C-3′ (restriction sites are underlined), respectively, under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and finally an extension of 72 °C for 7 min. The resulting product (∼2 kb) was digested with Bcl1 and SstI, gel-purified, and ligated into the BamH1/SstI site of the pVT-Bac transfer vector in-frame with a vector-derived signal peptide. This construct targets the recombinant open reading frame to the polyhedron locus of the BV genome. To facilitate purification, His6 residues were placed on the C terminus of the protein. The construct was sequenced to verify its accuracy and subsequently transfected along with BV DNA (BaculoGold, BD PharMingen) into insect cells. Recombinant virus was plaque-purified and used for protein expression. Using this system, the expressed protein is secreted into the culture medium. For the production of recombinant βig-h3, Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf-9) insect cells were infected with virus (4 plaque-forming unit/cell) and grown in suspension culture in Sf-900 medium for 3 days (∼70% survival). The cells next were pelleted by centrifugation (3600 rpm, 30 min at 4 °C). The medium containing soluble βig-h3 was extracted batchwise with S-Sepharose, and the resin was washed with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl; bound βig-h3 was eluted from the resin with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 350 mm NaCl. The eluting fraction was incubated with Talon resin (30 min at 4 °C), the resin was washed, and bound protein was eluted with 10 mm phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole. Our yield is ∼3 mg of purified βig-h3/liter of culture medium. Primary human bladder fibroblast cells were isolated as described previously (19Coplen D.E. Howard P.S. Duckett J.W. Snyder H.M.

Biol. 1994; 30A: 604-608Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Conditioned medium was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a HiTrap Mono S (strong cation exchange) column (Amersham Biosciences), the column was washed with 10 ml of 50 mm phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl salt gradient (0.05–1 m) in the same buffer. Aliquots from each fraction were analyzed on Western blots. Microtiter plates were coated with purified matrix component, or other proteins (50 μg/ml) diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBST and blocked with PBST containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the plates were incubated with βig-h3 overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with PBST. Bound βig-h3 was detected using anti-βig-h3 Ab1077 followed by incubation with anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:2000 in PBST). The plates were washed three times with PBST, incubated with peroxidase substrateO-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 4.6), 0.01% H2O2 for 30 min, and read at 450 nm. This assay design gave very consistent results. Polystyrene beads (0.125-inches diameter) were coated with gelatin or FN (100 μg/ml) in PBS in 3-ml siliconized Vacutainer tubes (no additives) for 15 h at 4 °C. To block the remaining sites and minimize nonspecific binding, the beads were washed and incubated with PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h (20Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J.

After the blocking step, the beads were used for binding studies. Two beads were incubated with 1 ml of βig-h3 (0.5 μg/ml) in PBST containing 0.3% BSA on a rocker (15 h at 4 °C). The beads were washed with PBST. Bound protein remaining on the beads was extracted and analyzed on Western blots. Falcon 96-well microtiter plates were coated with BSA or purified βig-h3, type I collagen, or full-length human FN (50 μg/ml) for 24 h at 4 °C. After coating, they were washed with PBS, and the remaining sites were blocked with PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h at 20 °C. Human fibroblast cells were gently trypsinized from flasks. Trypsinization was monitored microscopically, and as soon as the cells detached, they were immediately washed twice in serum-free medium containing 1% BSA and soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml). The cells were diluted in serum-free medium containing 1% BSA, seeded into wells (2.5 × 104 cells/well), and incubated for 1 h at 37C. The wells were washed twice with PBS and examined microscopically. To obtain a quantitative assessment of binding, microtiter plates were coated with purified matrix components (see above), the plates were washed, and remaining sites were blocked with PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h at 20 °C. To determine binding, the plates were seeded with human fibroblasts in serum-free medium containing 1% BSA (2.5 × 104 cells/well). The plates were incubated (37 °C for 1 h), washed twice with PBS, and the attached cells were stained with 1% toluidine blue in PBS, 10% formalin overnight. The plates were washed next with water, and the attached cells were lysed by the addition of 1% SDS (100 μl/well). The plates were read in a plate reader at 595 nm (21Retta S.F. Ternullo M. Tarone G. Dejana E. Corada M. Methods in Molecular Biology: Adhesion Protein Protocols. 96. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 125-130Google Scholar). For phalloidin staining, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with buffered formalin (10 min at 20 °C), washed with PBS, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA. The cells were incubated next with fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (diluted 1:200 in PBS, 0.3% BSA) at 4 °C overnight, washed three times with PBS, and examined with an Olympus FluoView confocal microscope equipped with an argon ion (488 nm) laser. To obtain sufficient quantities of protein for biochemical studies, full-length βig-h3 cDNA was cloned into BV and expressed in Sf-9 cells. The BV-expressed protein is secreted into the culture medium and isolated by a combination of cation exchange and metal chelate affinity chromatography (18Willis S.H. Peng C. Ponce de Leon M. Nicola A.V. Rux A.H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Brown S.M. MacLean A.R. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Herpes Simplex Virus Protocols. 10. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 131-156Google Scholar). The purified protein has a mass of ∼70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, close to the theoretical value derived from its amino acid sequence, and reacted well with our anti-βig-h3 antibody (Fig. 1). To verify that the recombinant protein is biologically active, we assessed its ability to serve as a support for cell attachment. Human fibroblasts were seeded into microtiter plates coated with purified matrix protein. After 1 h, the cells attached and began spreading on wells coated with βig-h3, Col I, and FN (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the cells seeded in BSA-coated wells were poorly attached and readily washed from the wells (Fig. 2 A). Cell binding was also examined using a quantitative binding assay. The cells were seeded into microtiter plates coated with purified matrix components. After a 1-h incubation, the plates were washed, and attached cells were stained with toluidine blue. The cells exhibited comparable levels of attachment to βig-h3, Col I, or FN but did not adhere to BSA-coated wells (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Cell attachment to matrix proteins.

To determine the effect of βig-h3 on intracellular actin, the cells were seeded into coated wells in serum-free medium, allowed to attach, and stained with phalloidin. Prominent actin stress fibers were present in cells seeded onto βig-h3 and Col I and FN (Fig. 3). Therefore, recombinant βig-h3 supports cell attachment, spreading, and actin stress fiber formation. Several studies have reported that βig-h3 is a component of the ECM, but its ability to interact with specific matrix components has not been examined in a detailed manner. The binding studies were performed by first coating microtiter plates with BSA, gelatin, Col I, or FN. The plates were washed, blocked, and subsequently incubated with βig-h3. No binding was detected to wells coated with gelatin (Fig.4) or BSA (data not shown). In contrast, we observed the saturable binding of βig-h3 to Col 1 and FN (Fig. 4). The calculated K d for βig-h3-FN interaction was 72 nm. These results verify that βig-h3 is capable of interacting with matrix proteins and exhibits relatively high affinity binding to FN. Additional experiments were undertaken to examine these interactions in greater detail. To establish specificity, competitive binding assays were performed by assessing βig-h3 binding to immobilized FN in the presence of increasing amounts of soluble FN. βig-h3 binding was inhibited with soluble competitor FN (Fig.5). To assess the stability of this interaction, plastic beads were coated with FN and subsequently incubated with βig-h3. The beads were washed next with buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl, and bound protein remaining on the beads was eluted and analyzed on Western blots. This analysis revealed that the FN·βig-h3 complex was stable at >250 mm NaCl (Fig.6).Figure 5Competitive binding assay.

The heparin binding fragment is present as a ∼30-kDa fragment on the N-terminal region of the FN molecule, whereas the collagen/gelatin binding fragment is contained within a 40-kDa fragment adjacent to the heparin binding domain. These fragments are generated by mild proteolytic digestion of human fibronectin and purified by ion-exchange chromatography (27Hynes R.O. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix, Anchor, and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1999: 422-425Google Scholar). Both fragments were obtained from Sigma and are >95% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.7). For binding studies, each peptide was immobilized on microtiter plates for use in solid phase binding assays. We found high affinity binding of βig-h3 to the collagen/gelatin domain (Fig. 8). In contrast, inconsistent binding to the heparin recognition site was observed (data not shown).Figure 8βig-h3 binding to FN domain.

An analysis of conditioned medium from these cells by Bio Gel P200 gel filtration chromatography (exclusion limit ∼200 kDa) revealed that the bulk of βig-h3 elutes with the void volume and an apparent M r > 200 (data not shown). This was unexpected given that the protein has mass of 70 kDa (see Fig. 1) and suggests that βig-h3 is present as a complex with itself or other proteins. To clarify this observation, the conditioned medium was fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography, and each fraction was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blots. βig-h3 was found to elute with ∼0.5 m NaCl (Fig.9 A). Subsequent incubation of the blots with an antibody to FN revealed that it eluted with the same ionic strength as βig-h3, suggesting that these proteins associate with each other in conditioned medium. To confirm that these proteins interact, additional experiments were undertaken. Anti-βig-h3 antibody 1077 was covalently attached to Affi-Gel-10. The conditioned medium was incubated with the immobilized antibody resin, the resin was washed extensively with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted and examined on Western blots probed with anti-βig-h3 and anti-FN antibodies. As expected, βig-h3 binds to the immobilized βig-h3 antibody (Fig. 9 B). In addition, FN also binds this resin. No binding of either protein was observed to preimmune IgG. Hence, FN immunoprecipitates with βig-h3. The structural integrity of the ECM is necessary for proper organ development and function. Matrix structure is in turn determined by precise interactions among individual matrix components (1Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol.

A primary goal of this study was to investigate the interaction of purified βig-h3 with specific components of the ECM. Full-length recombinant human βig-h3 was produced under native conditions in the baculovirus expression system. The purified protein supported the attachment and spreading of human fibroblasts. Similar results have been reported with dermal fibroblasts (28LeBaron R.G. Bezverkov K.I. Zimber M.P. Pavelec R. Skonier J. Purchio A.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 844-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and corneal epithelial cells (29Kim J.E. Kim S.J. Lee B.H. Park R.W. Kim K.S. Kim I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), suggesting that βig-h3 serves as an attachment factor for these cells as well. We also observed the formation of actin stress fibers in cells seeded on βig-h3-coated wells. The appearance of these fibers was similar to those observed in cells plated on Col I. The binding of cell surface integrins to specific ECM components activates intracellular GTPases and downstream effectors, resulting in actin polymerization and stress fiber formation (22Condeelis J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 288-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Defilippi P. Olivo C. Venturino M. Dolce L. Silengo L. Tarone G. Microsc. Res.

Shen M. Yan W. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Fujimoto K. Tanne K. Kato Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated that antibodies to α1β1 integrin block the attachment of chick cells to bacterially expressed βig-h3. Surprisingly, a recent report identified the pentapeptides NKDIL and EPDIM present in the second and fourth domains of βig-h3 as mediating corneal epithelial cell attachment to βig-h3 via α3β1 integrin (29Kim J.E. Kim S.J. Lee B.H. Park R.W. Kim K.S. Kim I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that cell attachment, spreading, and actin stress fiber formation are probably a consequence of βig-h3 engagement of specific cell surface integrins. The fractionation of conditioned medium by ion-exchange chromatography revealed that FN has a similar elution profile to βig-h3 (Fig.9 A). One interpretation of this finding is that these proteins associate with each other. Indeed, the results from this study support this hypothesis. FN was immunoprecipitated with βig-h3 from this same medium. Furthermore, recombinant βig-h3 exhibited high affinity binding to FN with a K d ∼70 nm (Fig. 4). Once formed, the βig-h3·FN complex was stable in >250 mm salt. By using peptides encompassing defined regions of FN in solid phase binding assays, we mapped one binding site for βig-h3 to the collagen/gelatin domain in the N-terminal region of FN (Fig. 8). Hence, these studies provide strong evidence that βig-h3 directly interacts with FN. A surprising result obtained in the course of our studies is that we were unable to completely block βig-h3 binding to immobilized FN with soluble competitor. This may be a reflection of differences in the interaction between βig-h3 and immobilized and soluble FN. The immobilization of FN may reveal βig-h3 binding sites that are not well exposed in soluble FN. Alternatively, there may be a nonspecific binding component in bound FN that cannot be totally eliminated with soluble competitor FN. FN is a dimeric glycoprotein (M r ∼440) and an abundant ECM component. It is involved in a wide range of physiological functions including cell attachment and spreading, wound healing, and vascularization. FN contains several well defined structural domains that interact with a number of macromolecules including collagen, fibrin, heparin, laminin, and cell surface integrins (for review see Ref. 25Magnusson M.K. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of FN arise via alternative splicing. These isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (25Magnusson M.K. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Romberger D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and differentially expressed during embryonic development and in certain pathological conditions (31Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Macleod J.N. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Kosmehl H. Berndt A. Katenkamp D. Virchows Arch. 1996; 429: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ability of FN to interact with a wide range of cell types and matrix proteins enables it to perform a wide range of functions. The results presented in the this report strongly suggest that FN is a candidate ligand for βig-h3 in the ECM, allowing βig-h3 to serve a linker function. In this capacity, βig-h3 could directly interact with cells via α1β1 and α3β1 integrins and other matrix components via FN. Alterations in the primary sequence of βig-h3 such as those observed in individuals with hereditary corneal dystrophies (14Munier F.L. Korvatska E. Djemai A., Le Paslier D. Zografos L. Pescia G. Schorderet D.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15 (, 247–251): 224-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) could directly effect its interactions with FN or other ECM components, altering the corneal matrix structure. In addition, βig-h3 has a theoretical isoelectric point of ∼7.3, and alterations in its primary structure may make the protein more prone to precipitating out of solution. This would be expected to have extreme effects on βig-h3-cell and βig-h3-matrix interactions. The results presented in the current report should provide a framework to address these issues in future studies.

The intrinsic resistance of P. aeruginosa results from a synergy of low outer membrane permeability and chromosomally encoded tripartite efflux systems (2Hancock R.E.W. Clin. Infect.

Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These efflux systems consist of an inner membrane drug-proton antiporter of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family (MexB, MexD, MexF and MexY), an outer membrane channel-forming component (OprM, OprJ, and OprN), and a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MexA, MexC, MexE, and MexX), which couples the inner and outer membranes for direct extrusion of antibiotics across both membranes (5Poole K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 255-264PubMed Google Scholar). The MexAB-OprM system is the first of the four efflux systems that have been described in P. aeruginosa and shows the broadest substrate range (11Poole K. Tetro K. Zhao Q. Neshat S. Heinrichs D.E.

Mutations inmexR lead to hyperexpression of the mexAB-oprMoperon, resulting in increased resistance to multiple antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, tetracycline, macrolides, chloramphenicol, novobiocin, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides (13Srikumar R.

Signaling molecules utilized in quorum sensing have also been implied as substrates for the efflux pumps in P. aeruginosa. Overexpression of the MexAB-OprM efflux system has been found to decrease intracellular accumulation of the P. aeruginosaautoinducer 3-O-dodecanoylhomoserine lactone (PAI-I) resulting in reduced expression of autoinducer regulated virulence factors (17Evans K. Passador L. Srikumar R. Tsang E. Nezezon J. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5443-5447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pearson J.P. van Delden C. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MexR is a member of the MarR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators (19Sulavik M.C. Gambino L.F. Miller P.F. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 436-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The marR gene is a component and negative regulator of the marRAB locus in Escherichia coli(20Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemther. 1997; 41: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the MarR family regulate the expression of resistance to multiple antibiotics, organic solvents, detergents and oxidative stress agents, and of pathogenic factors (21Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 410-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 22Miller P.F. Sulavik M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). By regulating the expression of the transcriptional activator MarA, MarR is able to regulate several MarA-regulated genes involved in antimicrobial resistance. The recently determined crystal structure of MarR in complex with the effector salicylate (23Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), revealed a dimeric structure with a winged helix DNA binding motif (24Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) in each MarR monomer. Two molecules of the effector salicylate, which inhibits DNA binding by MarR (21Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 410-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4669-4672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were bound to each subunit and located on either side of the proposed recognition helix in the DNA binding domain (denoted SAL-A and SAL-B). To understand the specific regulation of MexAB-OprM expression in Pseudomonas and to gain further insights into the molecular regulation of the DNA binding activity of other members of the MarR family, we have determined the crystal structure of MexR. We show that salicylate is not an effector for MexR and have also modeled the MexR-DNA complex, using the MexR operator sequence identified by previous footprinting studies (26Evans K. Adewoye L. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on our structural analysis of MexR, our model of the MexR-DNA complex and a comparison with the crystal structure of the MarR-salicylate complex (23Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we propose an allosteric mechanism of regulation of the DNA binding activity of MexR that likely differs from that of MarR. A wild type expression vector was constructed by PCR amplification of the mexR open reading frame (encoding residues 1–147 with no tags or additional residues) from the previously described vector pKLE1 (26Evans K. Adewoye L. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into the pET41a vector (Novagen) and used for the production of native and selenomethionine (SeMet)1-labeled MexR protein from Escherichia coli strain BL21 λDE3. An overnight seed culture (grown in LB with 50 μg/ml of kanamycin) was used to inoculate M9 medium (with 1:100 dilution) supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 4 g/liter glycerol. For the production of native protein, the medium was also supplemented with 2.5 g/liter of casamino acids. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ∼0.5, at which point isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for the production of native protein. For the production SeMet-labeled protein, 100 mg each of Thr, Lys, Phe, and 50 mg each of Leu, Ile, and SeMet were added per liter of culture at an OD600 of ∼0.5 with the subsequent addition of 0.5 mm IPTG after 15 min. Cells were shifted to room temperature and MexR expression was allowed to proceed overnight. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C, and the same procedure was used for both native and SeMet-labeled proteins. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min and frozen at −80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in a harvest buffer consisting of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were sonicated on ice (3 × 10 min, 30% pulse, 50% power), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied onto a SP-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with harvest buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.2 m NaCl. Unbound MexR protein in the initial flow-through was recovered and purified with a second pass over the SP-Sepharose column. Peak fractions as assessed by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled, diluted 5-fold with harvest buffer, and applied onto a heparin-agrose (Sigma) column (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with harvest buffer. MexR protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to ∼0.5 ml, and applied onto a Sephacryl-100 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column (2 × 65 cm) equilibrated with 10 mmtris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris-HCl; pH 8), 150 mmNaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 80–128 mg/ml as measured by the Bradford assay. The protein was assessed to be >90% pure by SDS-PAGE. Complete substitution of methionines in SeMet-labeled protein was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Crystals of MexR were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using protein solutions diluted to 8.8 mg/ml with water and with the addition of tris-(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride to a final concentration 10 mm. For native MexR, 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution consisting of 20 mm CaCl2, 65 mm NaCl, 6 mm MES (pH 6), 4 mmsodium acetate (pH 5), and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). For SeMet-labeled MexR, 2 μl of protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution consisting of 46 mmCaCl2, 105 mm NaCl, 6 mm MES (pH 6), 4 mm sodium acetate (pH 5), and 10 mm DTT. Crystals of both native and SeMet-labeled MexR grew after equilibration over 1 ml of reservoir solution for 12–24 h at 20 °C reaching dimensions of up to ∼0.15 × 0.15 × 0.3 mm for native crystals and 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm for SeMet-labeled crystals. MexR crystals were harvested in buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 6 mm MES (pH 6), 4 mm sodium acetate (pH 5), and 10 mm DTT. Crystals were cryo-protected by gradual transfer in ten increments to 33% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 20 mmCaCl2, 128 mm NaCl, 6 mm MES (pH 6), 4 mm sodium acetate (pH 5), and 10 mm DTT and were flash-frozen in a nitrogen cold stream prior to data collection. The increase in salt concentration with the addition of polyethylene glycol 400 was necessary to prevent shrinkage of the unit cell to a pseudo-tetragonal cell with pseudo-merohedral twinning. Due to their superior diffraction over native crystals, data from SeMet-labeled crystals were used for both structure determination and refinement. MAD data were collected at beam line 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, while a high resolution data set was collected at beam line X8-C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Data were processed using the HKL package (27Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Issacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar) and programs from the CCP4 software suite (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Following solvent flattening with RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar), an initial electron density map was sufficiently interpretable to allow Cα tracing (in XtalView; Ref. 31McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar) of one of the four MexR dimers in the asymmetric unit. This initial trace was manually positioned into the density regions for the remaining dimers, which were then used to derive non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators. A significantly improved electron density map was obtained after NCS averaging and phase extension to 2.15 Å with DM (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar), from which a nearly complete model of the asymmetric unit was built (Fig. 1). Due to the asymmetry of the MexR dimer, 4-fold multidomain averaging was done with the two monomers in each dimer treated as separate domains. The model was completed with iterative rounds of manual fitting and refinement in CNS (without NCS restraints). MAD phasing and model refinement statistics are given in Table I. Structure superpositions were made using LSQKAB (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar) and ALIGN (32Cohen G.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Interhelical angles and distances were measured using the program INTERHLX (33Yap K. INTERHLX program. University of Toronto, 1998nmr.uhnres.utoronto.ca/kyoko/new_prog/Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all figures were created with Molscript (34Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (35Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar). The MexR crystal structure and the MexR operator sequences identified by previous footprinting studies (26Evans K. Adewoye L. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) provide geometric constraints to guide the modeling of the MexR-DNA complex. Both the MexR dimer and the operator DNA sequence contain a 2-fold rotation axis relating the two MexR monomers and the inverted repeats, respectively, and these two axes are expected to coincide in the MexR-DNA complex. Each inverted repeat is five base pairs in length (5′-GTTGA) and is spaced five base pairs apart. Assuming that the MexR operator DNA adopts a canonical linear B-DNA conformation with 10.5 bp per turn, the major grooves of the inverted repeats would be positioned on the same side of the DNA, to which MexR is expected to bind. Taking these geometric constraints into consideration, MexR was manually docked onto an ideal model of the operator DNA with the MexR dimer oriented such that the DNA binding domains faced the major grooves of the inverted repeats. The crystal structure of MexR was determined using MAD data collected from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal. The final refined model shows good stereochemistry with 94.0% of residues in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystllogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and one residue in the disallowed region (Gln90 in chain D), which is located in a region of poor electron density. The overall structure (Fig.1 a) is predominantly α-helical and appears to resemble that of MarR (23Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The MexR dimer is triangular in shape and contains two winged helix DNA binding domains (residues 36–97 of each monomer), each connected via two long helices (α1 and α5) to a dimerization domain made up of the N- and C-terminal regions (residues 5–17 and 120–139) from the two monomers (Fig. 1, a andb). Hydrophobic residues from α1, α5, and α6 are buried at the dimerization interface. The total buried surface area ranges from 4360 to 4930 Å2 for the four MexR dimers in the asymmetric unit. The electrostatic interactions observed between the DNA binding domains of MarR (Asp67 of one monomer with Arg73′ from the other monomer and the reciprocal pair; Ref.23Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) are not present in MexR. The molecular packing in the MexR crystal has provided eight independent observations of the MexR monomer structure. A significant degree of flexibility is seen in the MexR structure as evidenced by the large deviations between the eight copies of the MexR monomer in the asymmetric unit, with overall r.m.s. (root mean square) deviations of 0.70–2.1 Å relative to monomer A for 512 pairs of main chain atoms (Fig.2 a). The regions encompassing helices α1, α5, and α6 (residues 4–32 and 99–139) show main chain r.m.s. deviations of 0.40–1.29 Å relative to monomer A, with the largest differences seen between monomers A and B. Flexibility at loop regions (residues 33–34, 97–98, and 121–123) allows helix α1 to deviate by 17.0° and 4.9 Å, α5 by 6.8° and 1.7 Å, and α6 by 12.1° and 8.2 Å in helix orientation and midpoint position, respectively. In contrast to MarR, clear main chain density is observed for α5, including Ser113, which corresponds to the poorly ordered region of Gly116 in MarR (a proposed flexible hinge region; Ref. 23Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition to the conformational differences among individual monomers, we also observe significant variations in the relative disposition of the two monomers at the dimerization interface in each of the four independent dimers in the asymmetric unit. These positional variations in the MexR dimer give rise to major differences in the disposition of the two DNA binding domains relative to each other (Fig.2 b). The interhelical interactions at the dimerization interface primarily consist of van der Waals contacts between hydrophobic side chains, which unlike hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, do not require specific geometric arrangements for the interacting atoms and therefore could accommodate significant reorientation of the dimerization helices relative to each other. With the exception of the W1 region, the winged-helix domain moves as a relatively rigid and well ordered entity. There is little deviation between the eight copies in the asymmetric unit (r.m.s. deviations of 0.31–0.57 Å relative to chain A for main chain atoms in residues 33–84 and 93–98). Superposition of the four observed MexR dimers using main chain atoms from one DNA binding domain per dimer (residues 33–84 and 93–98) shows a maximum helix midpoint displacement of 7.7 Å (between dimers AB and CD) for the recognition helix α4 in the other DNA binding domain. Of the four MexR dimers in the asymmetric unit, dimer CD shows the largest spacing between the DNA binding domains with a Cα-Cα distance of 29.2 Å between Arg73 and Arg73′ (from helix α4), which is close to the 34 Å spacing between major grooves in linear B-DNA. Manual docking of dimer CD onto the operator DNA produced a model with a reasonable match of the spacing between the recognition helices (α4 and α4′) with the spacing between the major grooves in the inverted repeats (Fig.3 a). Given the observed conformational adaptability of the dimerization interface, it is likely that in solution the spacing between the recognition helices may be further increased to provide an even closer match with the major groove spacing on the operator DNA. In our current model, the wings (W1) are well positioned to make minor groove or phosphate backbone contacts, presumably allowing for increased affinity in the interaction. Loss of one of the two inverted repeats on a 28-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the MexR binding site II (26Evans K. Adewoye L. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) byHincII digestion prevents binding by MexR (Fig.3 b) and is consistent with a single MexR dimer binding to both inverted repeats simultaneously. The predicted interactions of the recognition helices and wings with the major and minor grooves of the operator DNA for MexR would be similar to those observed in the CAP-DNA complex (37Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 38Parkinson G. Wilson C. Gunasekera A. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.E. Berman H.M. J. Mol.

All samples contained 247 ng of a 28-bp DNA oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′ATTTTA GTT↓GA CCTTA TCAAC CTTGTTT (the HincII site is in bold with the cleavage site indicated by ↓) corresponding to the MexR binding site II identified by previous footprinting studies (26Evans K. Adewoye L. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The DNA inlanes 3 and 4 were digested withHincII for 1 h and 40 min at 37 °C. Prior to loading onto the gel, 12.8 μg of SeMet-substituted MexR protein were added to samples in lanes 2 and 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An analysis of the interactions of the MexR C-terminal tail region with a neighboring MexR dimer in the crystal structure suggests that different conformations of the MexR dimer observed in the crystal structure may represent each of the distinct DNA- and effector-bound conformations. The C-terminal tail immediately follows α6 and consists of residues 140–147. While the C-terminal tail is disordered in most of the MexR monomers, interpretable electron density is visible for the C-terminal tail of monomer C (average B-factor of 38.7 Å2 for residues 140–147), which is inserted in between the DNA binding domains of dimer AB (Fig. 3 c). Interestingly, dimer AB exhibits the shortest spacing between its DNA binding domains (Cα-Cα distance of 22.6 Å between Arg73 and Arg73′). In contrast, dimer CD exhibits the largest spacing (Cα-Cα distance of 29.2 Å between Arg73 and Arg73′) between its DNA binding domains and shows no density for the C-terminal tail in the region between its DNA binding domains (Fig. 2 b). While dimer CD can be manually docked onto a linear model of the MexR operator DNA, the spacing of the recognition helices in dimer AB is incompatible with DNA binding as predicted by our model (Fig. 3, a and c), so that the conformations shown by dimers CD and AB can be interpreted as open (able to bind DNA) and closed (unable to bind DNA) states, respectively. The observation of an ordered C-terminal tail in between the DNA binding domains in the closed conformation (but not in the open conformation) suggests that binding of the C-terminal tail or a ligand resembling this peptide can inhibit DNA binding by inducing the closed conformation. In the absence of an effector or an effector-like ligand, repulsion between positively charged side chains (Arg21, His41, Arg63, and Arg70) lining the crevice between the DNA binding domains likely help to maintain the MexR dimer in the DNA binding conformation (Fig. 3, d ande). These charges are partially neutralized by Glu145, Asp146, and the C-terminal carboxylate on the C-terminal tail. Presumably the effector ligand will also have these acidic characteristics. Additionally Pro143, Leu144, and Ile147 from the C-terminal tail make a number of van der Waals contacts with hydrophobic side chains from dimer AB. Peptide binding at a homodimeric interface was also observed in the crystal structure of the natriuretic peptide receptor dimer (human NPR-C) in complex with a 22-amino acid natriuretic peptide (CNP), in which peptide binding induced a 20-Å closure of the membrane-proximal domains that interact with the peptide (39He X.-L. Chow D.-C. Martic M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1647-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Regulation of DNA binding activity by altering the spacing of the DNA binding domains in dimeric DNA-binding proteins has also been observed in the tetracycline repressor (40Orth P. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and the FadR repressor (41van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism proposed here for MexR is unique in that each MexR homodimer binds one effector molecule in contrast to the situation of one dimer binding two effector molecules observed in these other repressor systems (40Orth P. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 41van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An examination of the crystal packing of MexR predicts that interdimer interactions between the MexR C-terminal tail and DNA binding domains lead to the formation of MexR filaments, which is inconsistent with the high solubility of this protein. The interaction of the DNA binding domains with the C-terminal tail therefore likely occurs only under crystallization conditions, and the affinity is likely to be weak in solution, so that the C-terminal tail itself is unlikely to be thein vivo effector. However in the context of the MexR conformations observed in the crystal structure and the proposed model of the MexR-DNA complex, the C-terminal tail has identified a potential effector binding site on MexR and a conformation of the MexR dimer that is expected to be unable to bind DNA is apparently linked to interaction with the C-terminal tail. An overall structure-based alignment of MexR (monomer D) with the MarR monomer gives an r.m.s. deviation of 1.8 Å for 116 Cα positions. This relatively large overall r.m.s. deviation mostly results from conformational differences in the dimerization helices (α1, α5, and α6), since a superposition of the DNA binding domains gives an r.m.s. deviation of 1.2 Å (for 256 main chain atoms). The multiple conformations observed in the crystal structure of MexR contrast with the situation in MarR, in which the dimer 2-fold rotation axis coincides with a crystallographic 2-fold axis, so that the MarR asymmetric unit contains only one monomer (23Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The conformational flexibility seen in MexR is therefore not observed in MarR and may be accounted for in part by the salt bridge interactions, which tether the DNA binding domains of MarR and which are not conserved in MexR. The single dimer conformation observed for MarR differs drastically from the observed MexR dimer conformations. A superposition of the MexR and MarR (CD) dimers using the main chain atoms from one DNA binding domain for each dimer shows that the second recognition helix (α4′) of MarR is displaced 18.8 Å relative to that of MexR (Fig. 4 a). Given the unusual “zigzag” arrangement of the recognition helices in MarR and the expected positions of the inverted repeats being on opposite faces of the MarR operator DNA (42Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5456-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the mode of DNA binding by MarR is unclear and does not appear to resemble our proposed model of DNA binding for MexR. The salicylate binding sites in the MarR-salicylate complex were located on either side of the recognition helix (Fig. 4 b; Ref. 23Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The SAL-A site is located in a crevice between the recognition helix (α4) and the β-sheet (from which W1 loops out), while the SAL-B site is located on the opposite side of α4. In the absence of an apo MarR structure, the effect of salicylate binding to MarR on the dimer conformation (if any) is unclear; however, the observed positions of the SAL-A and SAL-B sites are distant from and seem unlikely to affect the conformation of the dimerization domain. Of the two salicylate binding sites observed in the MarR crystal structure, only for SAL-A are the structural characteristics similar for the corresponding region in MexR, while for SAL-B the binding of salicylate as observed in MarR would not be possible in MexR. However, sodium salicylate at a concentration of 5 mm is unable to dissociate the MexR-DNA complex as assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 4 c), which directly indicates differences in effector specificity between MexR and MarR. The results of this study indicate that the effector binding and mode of regulation between MexR and MarR are very different despite clear similarities in sequence and structure. This raises the possibility that members of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators may be diverse in the types of effector molecules recognized and in the ways their DNA binding activity is regulated. The inability of salicylate to inhibit DNA binding by MexR and the interactions of the C-terminal tail with the DNA binding domains of the MexR dimer suggest that the effector for MexR may be a peptide signaling molecule or the C terminus of a protein ligand. Further work is needed to identify the in vivo effector(s) for MexR, which will also shed light on the physiological function of the MexAB-OprM multidrug efflux system regulated by MexR.

There are multiple GABAA receptor subunit genes encoding the α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε, θ, and π subunits. These subunits co-assemble in different pentameric combinations throughout development to form functional receptors (reviewed in, e.g., Ref. 1Stephenson F.A. Stephenson F.A. Turner A.J. Amino Acid Neurotransmission. Portland Press, London1998: 65-92Google Scholar). The major GABAAreceptor subtype in adult brain is composed of α1, β2/3, and γ2 subunits with a probable stoichiometry of 2α1, 2β2/3, 1γ2. This subunit combination is expressed predominantly at the synapse, whereas other subunit combinations have different subcellular localizations, e.g. δ subunit-containing GABAAreceptors are localized extrasynaptically in cerebellar granule cells (2Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α2 subunit-containing receptors are found uniquely at axon initial segments in hippocampal pyramidal cells (3Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Benke D. Fritschy J.-M. Somogyi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11939-11944Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). By analogy with other neurotransmitter receptor systems, it is thought that GABAA receptor-associated proteins exist that determine receptor subcellular localization, mediate receptor clustering, and regulate receptor activity. For example, Sigel and colleagues (4Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported co-purification of α1 subunit-containing GABAAreceptors and several proteins including actin and tubulin. Some of these proteins were identified as GABAA receptor-tubulin complex-associated proteins, thus showing a link between the receptors and the cytoskeleton. One of these proteins, GABAAreceptor-tubulin complex-associated protein 34, was shown to be a novel serine kinase with specificity for β3 subunits (5Kannenberg K. Schaerer M.T. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21257-21264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). More recently, the same group identified this protein as the mitochondrial, multifunctional protein, gC1q-R (6Schaerer M.T. Kannenberg K. Hunziker P. Baumann S. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26597-266604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The glycine receptor-associated protein, gephyrin, has also been implicated in the synaptic clustering of GABAA receptors, although a direct association between the two proteins has not been shown (reviewed in Refs. 7Betz H. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 541-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and 8Sassoe-Pognetto M. Fristchy J.-M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2205-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Knock-out γ2 (−/−) mice have a parallel deficiency in both gephyrin and clustered post-synaptic GABAA receptors (9Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.-M. Luscher B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). More recently, the yeast two-hybrid system has been used to identify GABAA receptor-associated proteins. Proteins identified via this route include GABARAP (GABAA receptor-associated protein), Plic-1 (GABAA receptor-associated ubiquitin-like protein), and microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B). MAP-1B was shown to link GABAC receptors to the cytoskeleton at retinal synapses (10Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). GABARAP is a 13.9-kDa microtubule-associated protein that binds specifically to the γ2 subunit and promotes the clustering of GABAA receptors expressed in Qt-6 quail fibroblasts (11Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 12Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Differences in functional properties were reported between the clustered and unclustered receptors (12Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It has also recently been reported to mediate intracellular transport of GABAA receptors by virtue of its specific interaction withN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (13Kittler J.T. Rostaing P. Schiavo G. Fritschy J.-M. Olsen R.W. Triller A. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Plic-1 (formerly GRUB1) is a GABAA receptor-associated ubiquitin-like protein that binds the α1 subunit and plays a role in the stabilization of cell surface receptors (14Bedford F.K. Kittler J.T. Uren J.M. Thomas P. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. Suppl. 2000; 12 (016.14)Google Scholar, 15Bedford F.K. Kittler J.T. Muller E. Thomas P. Uren J.M. Merlo D. Wisden W. Triller A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify GABAAreceptor-associated proteins. Using the GABAA receptor β2 intracellular loop (β2-IL) as a bait, we have discovered a novel protein GABAA receptor interacting factor (GRIF-1) that is expressed predominantly in excitable tissues. The characterization of this protein is reported in this paper. The IL of the GABAA receptor β2 subunit was selected as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The coding sequence of the human β2-IL (aa 301–426; Ref. 16Ymer S. Schofield P.R. Draguhn A. Werner P. Kohler M. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1989; 9: 1665-1670Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing primers that containedEcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The product was subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the bait vector, pAS2–1 (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Likewise, constructs encoding Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD) fusion proteins of the rat GABAA receptor α1 (aa 304–384), β1 (aa 293–426), β3 (aa 293–426), and γ2L (aa 317–411) subunit ILs and β2-TM3/IL/TM4 (aa 292–439) and β2-IL/TM4 (aa 272–439) in pAS2–1 were prepared. The authenticity of all constructs was verified by nucleotide sequencing utilizing ABI PRISM dye terminator chemistry on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer and immunoblotting of respective yeast protein extracts. All bait constructs tested negative for auto-activation of reporter gene activity in the yeast two-hybrid reporter strains, CG1945 and AH109. Yeast cultures were grown on standard solid or in liquid media using either YPAD (yeast, peptone, adenine, dextrose; 2% (w/v) peptone, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.003% (w/v) adenine) or SD (synthetic dropout medium; 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (BD PharMingen, Cowley, Oxford, UK), 2% (w/v) glucose, 1× dropout supplement (CLONTECH) as appropriate for the selection involved). All transformations were performed using the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method (17Geitz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CG1945 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, cyhr2, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL417-mer (3x)-CYC1TATA-lacZ) was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library (in vector, pGAD10; CLONTECH) with pAS2–1β2-IL as a bait. Resulting colonies were assessed for reporter gene activation by initial nutritional selection (growth on SD −His) and subsequentlacZ activity assay. lacZ activity was determined by filter lift analysis, including appropriate positive and negative interaction controls. Clones encoding putative interacting proteins were isolated and analyzed following standard procedures (18Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). Their association with the GABAA receptor β2-IL was verified by reconstitution assays with a selection of different bait constructs introduced by both yeast mating assays and repeated co-transformation. β-Galactosidase reporter gene activity was determined by liquid culture assays using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate according to protocols provided by CLONTECH. Briefly, double transformants of yeast strain AH109 expressing the appropriate GAL4 BD and AD fusions were grown overnight in selective medium followed by expansion to mid-log phase in YPAD medium. Cells were harvested, washed once with Z-buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4), and resuspended in 0.2 of the original volume in Z-buffer. For each sample, 100 μl of cell suspension was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, and then 0.96 ml of Z-buffer containing 38 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.16 mmo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside was added. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min to overnight depending on the time taken for color development. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 m Na2CO3 (0.4 ml), cellular debris removed by centrifugation, and OD at λ = 420 nm measured against Z-buffer blanks. Values of β-galactosidase activity were normalized to the cell density of the expansion culture and then expressed as a percentage of wild-type Gal4p. The full-length GRIF-1 cDNA was obtained by a combination of cDNA library screening and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The clone resulting from the initial yeast two-hybrid screen was labeled with α-32P by the random primer method (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). It was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library by colony hybridization. DNA from positive clones were sequenced and used for subsequent screenings. In addition, 5′- and 3′-RACE was performed on rat brain cDNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification system (CLONTECH). RACE products were TA-subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) for further analysis. Cloned fragments and RACE PCR products were sequenced as described. The GRIF-1 contig was assembled using Lasergene software (DNAstar Inc., Madison, WI). The assembled cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence were subjected to analysis by a variety of predictive algorithms. BLAST searches were conducted against GenBankTM and EMBL data bases. Procrustes (20Gelfand M.S. Mironov A.A. Pevzner P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) analysis and a selection of hits obtained by BLAST searches against the human subset of GenBankTM and EMBL sequences were used to assemble the cDNA sequence of the human homologue of GRIF-1. Sequence alignments were performed with CLUSTAL. Structure predictions used a variety of publicly available resources such as psort (Ref. 21Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar; psort.nibb.ac.jp) and SMART (Ref. 22Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar; smart.embl-heidelberg.de). GRIF-1 cDNA fragments were radiolabeled with α-32P by a standard random priming method and used to probe a rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). Hybridization was carried out using ExpressHyb solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. After final washing (0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 °C), the blot was exposed to imaging plates for 20 h. Plates were read with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Aylesbury, Bucks., UK) and analyzed using ImageQuant software. A set of PCR reactions with primers spanning the whole GRIF-1 coding region was employed to screen for alternative spliced isoforms in rat brain. Amplification was usually performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 1× PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 0.2 μm each primer, 0.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.5 μl of cDNA (CLONTECH). Reactions were cycled through a profile consisting of 5 min of initial denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles consisting each of 25 s at 94 °C, 25 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step of 7 min at 72 °C on a Hybaid OmniGene thermal cycler. PCR products were separated by flatbed agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and analyzed using the EDAS120 imaging system (Eastman Kodak Co.). A fusion protein was used to generate anti-GRIF-1 polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. For the fusion protein, the DNA encoding GRIF-1-(8–633), i.e. the original library clone, was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector, pTrcHisB (Invitrogen). BL 21 Escherichia coli transformed with the recombinant pTrcHisBGRIF-1-(8–633) were cultured overnight, diluted 1:50 with LB and grown at 37 °C until mid-log phase (OD λ = 600 nm= 0.6). Expression of the poly(His)-GRIF-1-(8–633) fusion protein was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–5 h at 30 °C. The E. coli culture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer, which was 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 500 mm sodium chloride (10 ml) at 37 °C. The lysate was stirred gently at room temperature for 10 min followed by sonication (three 5-s pulses at high intensity) on ice. The cleared suspension was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the poly(His)-GRIF-1-(8–633) fusion protein purified from the supernatant by Ni2+ affinity chromatography using ProBond columns exactly as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) followed by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The purified fusion protein, Mr ∼ 70 kDa, was used to generate anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies were affinity-purified by GRIF-1-(8–633)-Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography prior to use (23Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Samples were prepared using the chloroform/methanol method of protein precipitation, and immunoblotting was carried out as previously described using affinity-purified anti-GABAA receptor α1 subunit (24Pollard S.

Anti-rabbit and mouse immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a final dilution of 1:2000. Where applicable, immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using a Personal Densitometer and ImageQuant (AmershamBiosciences) in the linear range of the film. Tissues from rat forebrain, cerebellum, liver, kidney, heart, and spleen were each homogenized in nine volumes of homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, containing benzamidine (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)) at 4 °C using a hand-held glass-glass homogenizer. Skeletal and cardiac muscle was removed, minced using scissors, and homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax (six 10-s pulses at medium speed) followed by homogenization as above. Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and the P1 nuclear pellets re-homogenized in three volumes of homogenizing buffer and re-centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Both supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C to yield the soluble (S) and P2 membrane fractions. The P1 and P2 pellets were re-suspended in homogenizing buffer and stored at −20 °C until use. The cDNA encoding the full-length GRIF-1a was obtained by PCR from rat brain cDNA and subcloned into both the mammalian expression vectors, pCIS and pCMV-Tag4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The latter yielded a C-terminal FLAG-tagged GRIF-1. HEK 293 cells were cultured and transfected in 250-ml flasks using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (26Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pCIS GRIF-1a or pCMV-Tag4GRIF-1a alone (10 μg of DNA) or with the GABAA receptor clones pCDM8α1 (bovine), pCISβ2 (rat), pCDM8γ2L (bovine), and pCISGRIF-1 or pCMV-TagGRIF-1 in a 1:1:1:1 ratio with a total of 10 μg of DNA. Cells were harvested 24–48 h following transfection and analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunocytochemical studies, transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate method on HEK 293 cells adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips. Transfected cells were cultured for 40 h, the cover slips washed three times for 5 min each at 20 °C with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 145 mm NaCl (TBS), followed by fixation with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in TBS for 10 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed three times for 5 min each with TBS containing 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100 followed by three 5-min washes with TBS containing 20% (v/v) goat serum, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% (w/v)dl-lysine. Transfected cells were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with the primary antibody diluted appropriately in TBS containing 10% (v/v) goat serum, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% (w/v) dl-lysine followed by five 5-min washes with TBS at 20 °C. Incubation with the secondary antibody, either goat anti-rabbit Ig-Alexa Fluor 594 or goat anti-mouse Ig-AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:150 in TBS. Finally, cells were washed five times for 5 min each time with TBS, mounted in UV-free mounting medium (H.D. Supplies, Muratech Scientific, Aylesbury, Bucks., UK), and viewed with a Leica TCSSP confocal microscope. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with pCMV-Tag4GRIF-1a + pCISβ2; pCISβ2 + pCIS, pCMV-Tag4GRIF-1a + pCDM8α1, or pCMV-Tag4GRIF-1a + pCIS (1:1 ratio with 10 μg of total DNA). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors as described above under “Subcellular Fractionation of Rat Tissues.” The solubilized material was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, diluted 1:3 in 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA + protease inhibitors, and incubated (8 ml) with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (30 μl; Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 20 s at 3000 ×g and the pellet washed with two 0.5-ml (17 volumes) amounts of 10 mm HEPES, 75 mm NaCl, 12.5 mmKCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm EGTA + protease inhibitors, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, followed by 17 volumes of the same buffer but with a Triton X-100 concentration of 1% (v/v). The pellets were collected by centrifugation as above and analyzed by immunoblotting. BL 21 cells were transformed with either pTrcHisBGRIF-1-(8–633) or the empty, pTrcHisB expression vector and the respective bacterial cell lysates prepared as detailed under “Generation of Anti-GRIF-1 Antibodies.” ProBond resin (Invitrogen) was washed three times with seven volumes of distilled H2O followed by seven volumes of denaturing binding buffer, which was 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 m urea, 500 mm NaCl. The resin (25 μl) was incubated with either the pTrcHis-GRIF-(8–633) lysate, the pTrcHis lysate or lysis buffer (1 ml) for 10 min at 20 °C. Each resin was then washed two times with 14-volumes native binding buffer, which was 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl. A detergent-solubilized rat forebrain P2 extract was prepared by re-suspension of a 100,000 × gP2 pellet in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, benzamidine HCl (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) to a concentration of 3 mg of protein. Solubilization was carried out for 1 h at 4 °C and the detergent extract cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C. The derivatized resins were incubated with the solubilized P2 membrane proteins diluted 1:3 with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 17 mm KCl, with the protease inhibitors as above to give final concentrations of 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 25 mm KCl (1 ml of 1 mg/ml protein) overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation of the resins at 200 × g for 10 s at 4 °C. Each resin was washed once with 40 volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl., 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. The bound proteins were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 μl), heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and the supernatants analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using affinity-purified anti-β2 fragment 381–395 (25Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 547SCrossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), anti-α1 fragment 413–429 (27Duggan M.J. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and anti-NSE antibodies (Affiniti Research Products Ltd., Mamhead, Exeter, UK). The results were analyzed by paired Student's t test. A series of GRIF-1 fragments were constructed by either standard subcloning techniques from the isolated library clone, C3, or PCR amplification. These were subcloned into pGAD10, pACT2, or pGADT7 (CLONTECH) to yield Gal4 AD fusion proteins. Similarly, fragments of the β2-IL (aa 303–427, 303–370, 355–427, 371–427, 303–394, 324–394, and 324–427) were fused to the GAL4 BD in pAS2–1. The yeast strain AH109 (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4Δ, gal80D, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ; CLONTECH) was transformed with pair-wise combinations of β2-ILBD and GRIF-1AD fusions. The interaction between pairs of proteins was assayed by nutritional selection on SD −4 (−His, −Trp, −Ade, −Leu) plates as well as β-galactosidase and α-galactosidase (Mel1) activity. α-Galactosidase activity was determined by overlaying the plates with X-α Gal-top agar (0.4% (w/v) low melting point agarose, 0.001% (w/v) X-α Gal (Melford Laboratories, Cambridge, UK) in Z-buffer. Coloration usually occurred within 3–6 h. The GABAAreceptor β subunits have been reported to determine the subcellular localization of αβγ receptors (28Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The β2 subunit is the most abundantly expressed of the β isoforms in adult brain (see, e.g., Refs. 29Li M. De Blas A.L. J. Biol.

Therefore, the GABAAreceptor β2-IL was selected as a bait to identify β subunit interacting proteins that may function as targeting or clustering molecules. A yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screen of 1.5 × 106 independent transformants with the GABAAreceptor β2-IL as the bait yielded initially 36 positively growing clones of which one, C3, showed lacZ reporter gene activity. The plasmid isolated contained a 1.8-kb insert with an in-frame fusion encoding 626 aa. Re-transformation of this clone into yeast strain, AH109, with a variety of different GABAA receptor subunit IL bait constructs, i.e. α1, β1, β3, and γ2-ILs, showed that C3 interacted specifically with the β2-IL (Table I). Further, C3 did not yield reporter gene activity when alternative β2-IL constructs that incorporated either both TM3 and TM4, i.e. β2-TM3/ILTM4, or TM4 only, i.e. β2-IL/TM4, were used as baits (Table I). Quantification of lacZ reporter gene activity revealed a relative strength of the C3/β2-IL interaction of ∼1.5% relative to 100% of the pCL-1 (Gal4p wild-type) positive control (Table I).Table IA summary of the specificity of the GRIF-1/GABAA receptor subunit interactions in the yeast two-hybrid systemGal4 binding domain fusion constructActivation domain constructHIS3, ADE2, lacZ, MEL1 reporter gene activitieslacZ activity%pAS2–1α1-ILpGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpAS2–1β1-ILpGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpAS2–1β2-ILpGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)+1.5 ± 0.4 (n = 3)pAS2–1β3-ILpGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpAS2–1β2-TM3/IL/TM4pGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpAS2–1β2-IL/TM4pGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpAS2–1γ2-ILpGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpAS2–1β2-ILpGADT7GRIF-1-(1–913)+1.7 ± 0.4 (n = 3)pAS2–1β2-ILpGADT7KIAA0549-(1–483)+1.2 ± 0.4 (n = 3)pAS2–1β2-ILpGAD10KIAA0549-(446–914)−NDpGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpVA3–1pGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633)−NDpVA3–1PTD1–1+++100PCL-1+++100 Open table in a new tab Nucleotide sequencing revealed that C3 contained an open reading frame of novel sequence fused in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain.

https://openalex.org/W2083267106,"Inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) is characterized by florid tumor emboli within lymphovascular spaces termed lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Using a human-scid model of IBC (MARY-X), we have demonstrated using retrovirally-mediated dominant-negative E-cadherin mutant approaches (H-2K(d)-E-cad), that the tumor cell embolus (IBC spheroid) forms on the basis of an intact and overexpressed E-cadherin/alpha, beta-catenin axis which mediates tumor cell-tumor cell adhesion analogous to the embryonic blastocyst and accounts for the compactness of the embolus. The tumor cell embolus (IBC spheroid), in contrast, fails to bind the surrounding vascular endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo because of markedly decreased sialyl-Lewis X/A carbohydrate ligand-binding epitopes on its overexpressed MUC1 which are necessary for binding endothelial cell E-selectin. This tumor cell-endothelial cell aversion further contributes to the compactness of the IBC spheroid and its passivity in metastasis dissemination. This passivity is manifested by a dramatic increase in metastatic pulmonary emboli following palpation of the primary tumor. In assessing this passivity of metastatic dissemination, we compared the effects of palpation on MARY-X with the effects of palpation on a derived dominant-negative E-cadherin mutant (H-2K(d)-E-cad), as well as other well known human tumoral xenografts exhibiting no (MCF-7, T47D), low (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) or high (C8161, M24(met)) levels of spontaneous metastasis but no LVI. Palpation of each xenograft similarly increased intratumoral pressure by 200% (10-->30 mmHg) but dramatically increased the numbers and sizes of pulmonary metastases 10-100-fold (P<0.001) only in MARY-X. The mechanism of this effect was through an immediate post-palpation release of circulating tumor emboli detected 2-3 min after palpation (P<0.01) by human cytokeratin 19 RT-PCR of extracted RNA from 300 microl of murine blood. Although circulating human tumor cell-derived growth factors (IGF-I, IGF-II, TGF-alpha and TGF-beta) and angiogenic factors (VEGF and bFGF) were detected by ELISA in murine serum of MARY-X, palpation did not further increase the circulating levels of these factors (P>0.1). Our findings support the cooperative role of E-cadherin and sialyl-Lewis X/A-deficient MUC1 in the passive dissemination of tumor emboli in IBC."

Evidence suggests that HS interacts with both FGFs and FGFRs to form active ternary signaling complexes. Here we compare the interactions of two FGFRs with HS. We show that the ectodomains of FGFR1 IIIc and FGFR2 IIIc exhibit specific interactions with different characteristics for both heparin and porcine mucosal HS. These glycans are both known to activate FGF signaling via these receptors. FGFR2 interacts with a higher apparent affinity than FGFR1 despite both involving 6-O-, 2-O-, andN-sulfates. FGFR1 and FGFR2 bind heparin with mean association rate constants of 1.9 × 105 and 2.1 × 106m−1s−1, respectively, and dissociation rate constants of 1.2 × 10−2 and 2.7 × 10−2 s−1, respectively. These produced calculated affinities of 63 and 13 nm, respectively. Hence, FGFR1 and FGFR2 bind to heparin chains with markedly different kinetics and affinities.

Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). The FGFRs belong to a family of five genes (FGFR1–5), from which alternative splicing generates diverse isoforms (3Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. Prog.

Gene. 2001; 271: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate (HS) is a family of linear polysaccharides located at the surface of cells and in the extracellular matrix. HS chains are attached to core proteins, forming a class of glycoproteins called proteoglycans (5Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). HS consists of a backbone disaccharide repeat of alternating glucosamine and hexuronate monosaccharides on which are superimposed highly variable patterns ofN- and O-linked sulfate groups and uronate epimerization; that is, iduronate (IdoUA) or glucuronate residues. This creates diverse molecular motifs, which present unique displays of sulfate, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups (6Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The modifications are clustered, producing the domain structure of HS; that is, stretches of sulfated saccharides (termed NS domains or S domains) separated by N-acetyl-rich saccharides (termed NA domains). The NS domains are rich in IdoUA and the NA domains in glucuronate. Heparin can be regarded as a special class of HS expressed by mast cells and also oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte progenitor cells (7Stringer S.E. Mayer-Proschel M. Kalyani A. Rao M. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Heparin is highly sulfated, contains a high abundance of IdoUA, and lacks the ordered domain structure seen in HS (8Conrad H.E. Heparin Binding Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The sequences within heparin may in many aspects resemble those of highly sulfated NS domains of HS. It has been shown that heparin and HS bind to proteins and modulate their activities via specific sulfated sequences within the chains (commonly within the NS domains) (6Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M.

The latter only occur in the presence of active heparin or HS and are accompanied by a sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPKand p90RSK (33Delehedde M. Seve M. Sergeant N. Wartelle I. Lyon M.

The kinetics of ternary complex formation, therefore, may be important in determining the time scale of intracellular signaling and, as a result, cell fate. The rate constants of FGF2 binding to purified or cell surface HSPGs and FGFRs have been characterized (25Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The rate constants of FGF1 and FGF2 binding to heparin have also been investigated using optical biosensor methodology (34Mach H. Volkin D.B. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Linhardt R.J. Fromm J.R. Loganathan D. Mattsson L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5480-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35Kinsella L. Chen H.L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the kinetics of FGFR binding to heparin or HS have not been determined. In contrast, several studies have investigated the affinity of the interaction between FGFRs and heparins (29Loo B.M. Kreuger J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The values reported cover a very wide range from 10 nm to 104 μm. An explanation for this may be the different heparin and protein preparations or, more likely, the different techniques used. Furthermore, some of the studies differ in the presence of divalent cations, which have been observed to be required for the interaction of FGFR1 with heparin in one study (38Kan M. Wang F. To B. Gabriel J.L. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Signaling by FGFRs has been shown to be regulated by specific HS saccharides in both a receptor and ligand-specific manner (15Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The ability of HS saccharides to determine which of FGFR1 IIIc and FGFR2 IIIc is activated by a common ligand suggests that different receptors have the capacity to bind differently to HS sequences and that these differences may regulate FGF signaling (15Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To investigate whether FGFRs interact differently with heparin/HS, we have compared the direct interaction of soluble FGFR1 IIIc and FGFR2 IIIc ectodomains with both heparin and porcine mucosal HS (PMHS) in the absence of FGFs. The results show that under the same conditions FGFR1 and FGFR2 bind both heparin and PMHS differently despite having the same general requirements for 6-O- and N-sulfation of glucosamine and 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA. These receptors also bind heparin chains with different kinetics; FGFR2 possesses a faster association rate constant, resulting in a higher intrinsic affinity. These findings suggest that the dynamics of FGFR·HS binary complex formation are an important aspect of the mechanism by which HS/FGFR interactions regulate FGF signaling. PMHS was a gift from Organon (Oss, Netherlands). Bovine lung heparin and porcine intestinal mucosal heparin were purchased from Sigma. Chemically modified heparins were prepared from bovine lung heparin as previously described (39Yates E.A. Santini F. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Torri G. Casu B. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 294: 15-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMR characterization of the modified heparins indicated that selective removal of 2-O- and N-sulfates had been 80 and 100% successful, respectively, with no other alterations, whereas 6-O-desulfation had removed 90% of 6-O-sulfates but also 30% of 2-O-sulfates. Production of murine FGFR1 IIIc and human FGFR2 IIIc ectodomains as fusion proteins with human IgG1 Fc (FGFR-Fc) was as previously described (40Anderson J. Burns H.D. Enriquez-Harris P. Wilkie A.O. Heath J.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), except that the receptors were separated from co-purifying HSPG material by washing with 0.5 m NaCl while immobilized on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). FGFR-Fc proteins were also expressed in the presence of [3H]glucosamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (5 μCi/ml), which was added before transient transfection and maintained throughout expression. IgG1 Fc was purified by cleavage of the FGFR-Fc proteins at the junction between the receptor ectodomain and the Fc using the human rhinovirus 3C protease, as previously described (40Anderson J. Burns H.D. Enriquez-Harris P. Wilkie A.O. Heath J.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The concentrations of proteins were determined using a Coomassie assay kit (Pierce) and A 280 values with BSA standards. Proteins were analyzed using 7.5% Tris-glycine discontinuous SDS-PAGE with protein molecular mass markers as standards (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting using polyclonal goat anti-human IgG-Fc conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) detection. Material eluting in the 0.5 m NaCl wash of FGFR-Fc (expressed in the presence of [3H]glucosamine) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose was subjected to sequential treatment with alkali and nitrous acid as previously described (41Brickman Y.G. Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The material from each stage was applied to a Sepharose CL-6B (AmershamBiosciences) gel filtration column (0.7 × 50 cm), and the resulting fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Estimates of the size of HSPGs or HS chains from Sepharose CL-6B chromatography were based on published calibrations (42Laurent T.C. Tengblad A. Thunberg L. Hook M. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 43Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). BaF3 cells transfected with FGFR1 IIIc were maintained in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 ng/ml interleukin 3 (R & D systems). Dilutions of FGF2 and FGFR-Fc proteins and bovine lung heparin were prepared in RPMI growth medium. Cells were added to a final density of 104 cells/ml in medium without interleukin 3 and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 72 h before determining cell viability using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (15Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added for 4 h at the above conditions before solubilization by the addition of 100 μl of 10% SDS, 0.01 m HCl for 16 h.A 570 values were measured using a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). As a positive control, the cells were incubated as above in growth medium containing 1 ng/ml interleukin 3, whereas negative controls used growth medium alone. Radiolabeled FGFR-Fc or IgG1 Fc proteins (∼5000 or 250 cpm/pmol, respectively) were applied to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in PBS using an HPLC system (Shimadzu). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS, and bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl in PBS (0–1 m over 30 min at 1 ml/min). 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Sugars were biotinylated either at the reducing end or along the chain. For the former, bovine lung heparin was dissolved in 100 mm MES (pH 5.5) containing a 50-fold excess of 50 mm biocytin hydrazide (Sigma) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The polysaccharide was separated from unconjugated biocytin hydrazide by sequential runs over Sephadex G-25 HiTrap columns (AmershamBiosciences) using an HPLC system eluting in de-ionized water and monitoring absorbance at 232 nm. Biotinylation of porcine mucosal heparin and PMHS along the chain were performed as described previously (35Kinsella L. Chen H.L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or by modification of a published method (44Lee W.T. Conrad D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), respectively. For the latter, PMHS was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of sulfo-NHS-LC-LC biotin (Pierce) in a solution of 0.2 mNa2CO3 (pH 8.6) for 3 days at room temperature before ethanol precipitation and then gel filtration as described above. Three μg/ml streptavidin (ICN) in 0.1 mNa2CO3HCO3 (pH 9.6) was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc). The plates were blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma) (PBS5T), and then incubated with biotinylated bovine lung heparin or PMHS (∼ 5 or 75 μg/ml, respectively) in 1% (w/v) BSA, PBS5T for 1–2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBS5T, and serial dilutions of FGFR-Fc proteins in 1% (w/v) BSA, PBS5T were transferred to the wells and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h for binding to reach equilibrium. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of heparin or PMHS at 100× each FGFR concentration. The plates were washed in PBS5T and incubated with goat anti-human IgG Fc horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) diluted 1:1000 in 1% (w/v) BSA, PBS5T for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS5T the plates were developed with o-phenylenediamine (Dako), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and A 490values were measured using the microtiter plate reader. For competition experiments, the procedure was as detailed above, except that a constant concentration of FGFR-Fc was incubated with variable concentrations of soluble competitors in 1% (w/v) BSA, PBS5T. Equal masses of competitors were used, since the polydisperse nature of GAGs renders molecular weight determinations of full-length chain mixtures, and therefore calculated molarities, inaccurate. Four-parameter logistic equations were fitted to data, plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale using non-linear regression with Prism software (Graphpad, UK). Binding reactions were carried out in an IAsys resonant mirror biosensor at 20 °C using planar aminosilane surfaces derivatized with streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Labsystems, Cambridge, UK). Immobilization of biotinylated porcine mucosal heparin (ligand) on streptavidin-derivatized surfaces and the binding of soluble FGFR-Fc to the heparin surface were as described for FGFs previously (13Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, ligate (FGFR-Fc) was added at a known concentration in 30 μl of PBS, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS2T), and the association reaction was followed over a set time. The cuvette was washed 3 times with 50 μl of PBS2T, and the dissociation of bound ligate into the bulk PBS2T was followed over time. To remove residual bound ligate and so regenerate the immobilized ligand, the cuvette was washed three times with 50 μl of 2 m NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2). After a single wash with 50 μl of PBS2T, the dissociation of bound FGFR2-Fc into bulk PBS2T containing excess (5 mg/ml) heparin was also monitored. Binding parameters were calculated from the association and dissociation phases of the binding reactions using non-linear curve-fitting FastFit software (Affinity Sensors) provided with the instrument. Several experimental precautions were taken to minimize the influence of artifacts due to mass transport, steric hindrance, ligate bivalency, or ligand heterogeneity (45Powell A.K. Characterization of the Interaction of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors with Heparin Sulfate.Ph.D. thesis. University of Birmingham, 2001Google Scholar, 46Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 47O'Shannessy D.J. Winzor D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The amount of ligand immobilized was minimal, association curves were obtained using the minimal concentrations of ligate required to obtain an adequate response, whereas the dissociation of ligate from the surface was followed for high concentrations of ligate (greater than 700 nm). The FGFR-Fc proteins used in this study possess the Fc and hinge region of the human IgG1 variant and, hence, are purified as disulfide-linked dimers. Similar FGFR dimers have been found to bind FGF7 differently to analogous monomeric FGFRs (37LaRochelle W.J. Sakaguchi K. Atabey N. Cheon H.G. Takagi Y. Kinaia T. Day R.M. Miki T. Burgess W.H.

The FGFR-IgG1 Fc molecules are likely to adopt a distorted Y conformation (49Carrasco B. Garcia de la Torre J. Davis K.G. Jones S. Athwal D. Walters C. Burton D.R. Harding S.E. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 50Harris L.J. Skaletsky E. McPherson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), where the short hinge and single interchain disulfide bond, five residues from the hinge terminus nearest the Fc (51Brekke O.H. Michaelsen T.E. Sandlie I. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 85-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), provide the FGFR ectodomains of the FGFR-Fc molecules with limited flexibility but do not allow them to become juxtaposed. This combined with the precautions adopted makes it likely that the interactions characterized are those of FGFR ectodomains interacting with heparin chains without avidity effects. FGFR1 and FGFR2 IIIc ectodomains, comprising Ig-like domains I-III, were expressed as soluble FGFR-Fc fusion proteins using human epithelial kidney (HEK) 293T cells. Analysis of purified FGFR-Fc proteins (washed with 0.5 m NaCl: see next section below) using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) showed single species of ∼100 kDa. Glycosylation of the ectodomains and Fc would account for this apparent molecular mass being greater than the molecular mass of the fusion proteins predicted from the amino acid sequence (∼ 69 kDa) and the diffuse nature of the bands. Western blot analysis confirmed these species contain human Fc (data not shown). The use of a mammalian cell line for expression of the FGFR-Fc proteins prompted us to investigate whether endogenous HS, shed from the surface of the cells, was able to co-purify with the receptors. Preliminary experiments indicated that such material could block binding of the recombinant receptors to heparin (data not shown). Fusion proteins were expressed in the presence of [3H]glucosamine to incorporate radiolabel into HS. It had previously been shown that the interaction between FGFR1 and heparin could be disrupted using NaCl (28Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Analysis of 0.5 m NaCl washes of protein A-Sepharose-immobilized FGFR2-Fc by Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration showed a high molecular weight molecule eluting near the void volume (V o) of the columns (Fig.2 A). The elution position of this material shifted significantly away from V oupon treatment with alkali, which cleaves HS chains from the core proteins of HSPGs (Fig. 2 B). Upon treatment with nitrous acid, which cleaves at N-sulfated glucosamine residues, characteristic of GAG chains of the HS type (52Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), the material chromatographed predominantly in the total volume (V t) of the column (Fig. 2 C). Overall, the data indicate that the co-purifying material was an HSPG of ∼120 kDa displaying HS chains with a mass of ∼20 kDa. FGFR1-Fc and FGFR2-Fc, depleted of endogenous HS using a NaCl wash step as described above, were tested for their ability to inhibit FGF2/heparin-stimulated pro"

This process depends on the activation of protein kinase C and is mediated by the interaction of highly conserved sequences in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR)1 of the mRNA with neuronal-specific RNA-binding proteins (16Kohn D.T. Tsai K.-C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One of these proteins was identified as the ELAV-like protein HuD (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chung S.M. Eckrich M. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Kohn D.T. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6593-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Blocking endogenous HuD expression using antisense RNA was found to decrease the levels of the GAP-43 mRNA and protein in PC12 cells and to limit process outgrowth (18Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of HuD in PC12 cells causes an increase in GAP-43 protein levels and cellular differentiation, even in the absence of nerve growth factor (19Anderson K.D. Morin M.A. Beckel-Mitchener A. Mobarak C.D. Neve R.L. Furneaux H.M. Burry R. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we proposed that HuD is the main regulatory protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the GAP-43 gene. HuD belongs to the highly conserved elav(embryonic lethal abnormalvision) family of RNA-binding proteins (20Antic D. Keene J.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). HuD is one of four mammalian ELAV-like proteins that have been identified, three of which are exclusively expressed in the nervous system. These proteins contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs); RRMs I and II bind to AU-rich motifs (22Liu J. Dalmau J. Szabo A. Rosenfeld M. Huber J. Furneaux H.M. Neurology. 1995; 45: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas RRM III binds to long stretches of poly(A) (23Ma W.-J. Chung S. Furneaux H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Abe R. Sakashita E. Yamamoto K. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4895-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). HuD has been shown to bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) found in the 3′-UTRs of several mRNAs including c-Fos (25Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), tau (26Aranda-Abreu G.E. Behar L. Chung S. Furneaux H. Ginzburg I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6907-6917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p21 waf1 (27Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and GAP-43 (17Chung S.M. Eckrich M. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Kohn D.T. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6593-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the mechanism by which HuD stabilizes the GAP-43 mRNA using a combination of in vivo and cell-free mRNA decay assays. We found that HuD increases the stability of this mRNA in both systems. This process depends on the presence of the HuD binding element in the GAP-43 3′-UTR and on the size of the poly(A) tail. GAP-43 mRNAs with short tails (A30) were found not only to be less stable than their A150 counterparts, they were also unable to be stabilized by HuD. Consistent with these findings, we observed that the affinity of HuD for the GAP-43 mRNA increased ∼10-fold when the RNA contained long versus short tails. Altogether, our results suggest that HuD controls GAP-43 mRNA stability by binding to its recognition element in the 3′-UTR and decreasing the initial rate of deadenylation of mRNAs with long poly(A) tails. The construction of the inducible expression vectors used for in the in vivomRNA decay assays has been described previously (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kohn D.T. Tsai K.-C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the rat GAP-43 cDNA was cloned into the pMEP4 vector (Invitrogen), containing the human metallothionein-IIA promoter. In the presence of cadmium, this vector increases the expression of the transgene by ∼8–10-fold (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To co-express HuD in PC12 cells, we used a pcDNA3-derived construct containing the human HuD cDNA (a gift from H. Furneaux) downstream of the CMV promoter (pcHuD). As shown by Mobarak et al. (18Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), this construct directs the constitutive expression of HuD in PC12 cells increasing the levels of HuD protein in the cells 2–3-fold. In addition to the generation of mammalian expression vectors, additional constructs were generated for the synthesis of radiolabeled RNAs by in vitro transcription. A full-length rat GAP-43 cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using specific 5′- and 3′-UTR flanking primers (5′-GGAATAAGGATCCGAGGAGGAAAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GACGTCGACGCTAATTGGCACATTTGC-3′, respectively). This fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of the SP64-poly(A) (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield pSP64-GAP. When this plasmid is linearized withSmaI, the resulting transcript contains no poly(A) tail, but when it is digested with EcoRI, the RNA contains a tail of exactly 30 As. To delete the HuD binding site from the GAP-43 3′-UTR, we used a trans-PCR protocol described by Neve and Neve (28Neve R.L.N. Neve K.A. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 163-174Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR reactions used the full-length GAP-43 cDNA as template and the following primers, 5′-ACACACTTGGAACTCCCACAGGGCCACACGCACCAG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTGTGGGAGTTCCAAGTGTGTGTGTGCAATGTT-3′ to loop out the internal 27-nucleotide sequence. A second round of PCR used the flanking 5′- and 3′-UTR primers described above to yield the full-length product containing a single 3′-UTR deletion. This PCR product was then cloned into pCR-Script (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting plasmid was called pΔHuD. To verify the specificity of the in vitro decay assay, the entire GAP-43 3′-UTR was replaced by that of β-globin and cloned into pMEP4 as described by Tsai et al. (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid (called C2) was digested withHindIII and XhoI and the resulting insert, BG3′UTR, was cloned into pBlueScript II (Stratagene). GAP-43-deficient PC12 cells (PC12-N36 clone, a gift from Richard Burry) were maintained in RPMI media supplemented with 7.5% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum. PC12 cells were transfected by electroporation with pMEP4-GAP-43, pcHuD, or empty vectors as previously described (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kohn D.T. Tsai K.-C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were maintained in the presence of 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (for pMEP-4 constructs) and/or 500 μg/ml G418 (for pcDNA3-derived constructs), and used for GAP-43 expression analysis. In vivo mRNA decay studies were performed in pMEP-4-GAP-43-transfected PC12 cells essentially as described by Tsai et al. (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pre-incubated with 5 μm CdCl2 for 16 h to induce GAP-43 transcription from the human metallothionein IIA promoter. To start the decay analysis, the medium was washed out and replaced with fresh medium without cadmium (time 0). Cultures were incubated for various time periods, cells were then harvested, and RNA isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma). For H-mapping studies, the RNA was further purified using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fifteen μg of total RNA extracted from cells was run on 1.1% formaldehyde-agarose gel as previously described (9Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed for GAP-43 mRNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA using32P-radiolabeled cDNA probes generated by random priming (Prime-a-Gene, Promega). Membranes were scanned on a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Invitrogen) and analyzed using the ImageQuant software package. The density of the GAP-43 bands was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, and results were expressed as percentage of the mRNA remaining relative to time 0 as previously described (9Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). H-mapping was performed essentially as described by Brewer and Ross (29Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 203-209Google Scholar) with a few modifications. For in vivo decay assays, 30 μg of total RNA extracted from transfected cells were dissolved in 1 mm EDTA and annealed to an antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CTTAAAGTTCAGGCATGTTCTTGGT-3′) that is complementary to a sequence overlapping the beginning of the 3′-UTR. After digestion with RNase H (United States Biochemical Corp.) (0.75 units/reaction), the resulting fragments were run on a 1.35% NuSieve® 3:1 agarose gel (FMC, Rockland, ME) and probed as described above. For in vitro decay assays, radiolabeled RNAs were purified using RNeasy minicolumns. Purified RNAs were annealed to the antisense oligonucleotide and treated with RNase H as described above. Fragments were analyzed using 10% polyacrylamide-urea gels. Capped and polyadenylated RNAs were synthesized by a combination of in vitro transcription and subsequent polyadenylation. To radiolabel the body of the RNA, RNAs were transcribed in vitro in the presence of 1 mm cap analog 7mG(5′)ppp(5′)G (Invitrogen) and of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 80 Ci/mmol). Wild type full-length GAP-43 RNA was synthesized in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and pSP64 GAP. Constructs were linearized either with SmaI to prepare RNAs without tails or EcoRI to prepare RNAs with tails of 30 As. GAP-43 RNAs without the HuD binding site were synthesized using EcoRI-digested pΔHuD and T3 RNA polymerase. To prepare chimeric GAP-43 RNAs with the β-globin 3′-UTR, BG3′UTR was linearized with XhoI and plasmids transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase. For studies measuring the decay of the poly(A) tail, unlabeled RNAs were transcribed in the presence of cold nucleotides and poly(A) tails were labeled in vitro as described below. Radiolabeled RNAs were polyadenylated in vitro using 1.5–2 units/fmol RNA of yeast poly(A) polymerase (United States Biochemical Corp.) and 500 μm cold ATP according to the manufacturer's protocol. To prepare radioactive poly(A) tails, polyadenylation reactions were performed in the presence of 50 μm ATP plus 25 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. Comparison of the sizes of mRNA with and without tails against an RNA ladder (Invitrogen) revealed that under these conditions the length of the poly(A) tail was between 150 and 200 As (data not shown). In vitro decay reactions were performed as described by Brewer and Ross (29Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 203-209Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Radiolabeled RNAs (2 fmol/reaction) were preincubated in 25 μl of decay buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol (DTE). 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 1 mm ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, 0.1 mm spermine, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 80 units/ml RNasin) in the absence (control) or presence of 1 μg of recombinant GST-HuD fusion protein. Recombinant proteins were prepared using pGEX-2T-HuD (a gift from Henry Furneaux) as described by Chunget al. (25Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To control for the specificity of GST-HuD, some control reactions used 1 μg of GST protein instead of the fusion protein. No differences were observed in the presence or absence of GST protein (data not shown). To begin the decay, isolated polysomes (0.1A 600 unit/fmol of RNA) were added and samples incubated for various times. Decay reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2× PK buffer (200 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 440 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, and 25 mm EDTA). Following proteinase K digestion, RNAs were isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and samples were analyzed in denaturing 10% polyacrylamide TBE, 8.3m urea gels. All gels were dried and analyzed using a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and the accompanying Quantity One software. Filter binding studies were performed as described by Chung et al. (25Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 fmol of [α-32P]UTP-radiolabeled full-length GAP-43 RNAs, with tails of 30 or 150 As, were incubated in the presence of recombinant HuD protein in binding buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTE) at 37 °C for 10 min. Protein concentrations for these studies ranged from of 30 to 600 nm. Samples were then transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and counts were analyzed by scintillation counting. We have previously shown that HuD stabilizes the GAP-43 mRNA in transfected PC12 cells and neurons, leading to increased protein expression and neuronal differentiation (18Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Anderson K.D. Morin M.A. Beckel-Mitchener A. Mobarak C.D. Neve R.L. Furneaux H.M. Burry R. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Anderson K.D. Sengupta J. Morin M. Neve R.L. Valenzuela C.F. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 168: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to characterize the mechanism by which HuD exerts these effects using a combination of in vivo and in vitromRNA decay assays. Initial studies examined the decay of the GAP-43 mRNA in transfected GAP-43-deficient PC12 cells using an inducible expression system. The pMEP4-GAP vector allows the transient expression of the GAP-43 mRNA by cadmium induction; its subsequent decay can then be measured by Northern blot analysis in the absence of any transcriptional inhibitors (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kohn D.T. Tsai K.-C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, to assess the effect of HuD in GAP-43 mRNA stability, some cultures were co-transfected with a constitutive HuD expression vector (pcHuD) that increases HuD protein level in the cell by 2–3-fold (18Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of exogenous HuD, the GAP-43 mRNA decayed with a half-life (t 12) of ∼5 h, similar to that previously calculated using radioisotopic mRNA decay methods (9Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HuD decreased the overall rate of decay of the mRNA, and the resulting t 12 was calculated as 8.5 h. Regression analysis also indicated that the best fit for mRNA turnover in the presence of HuD was obtained using a two-rate exponential decay instead of a single rate as in the case of the GAP-43 mRNA alone. The biphasic decay profile consisted of an initial 3-h delay in the onset of degradation of the mRNA, followed a by similar second rate decay as in the absence of exogenous HuD. Delays in the onset of mRNA decay similar to this have been observed for mRNAs containing type I AREs in the 3′-UTR, such as c-Fos (31Chen C.Y., Xu, N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In that case, the lag in decay reflected the time required to degrade the poly(A) tail. To test whether a similar mechanism was operating on the GAP-43 mRNA, subsequent experiments used H-mapping to monitor the decay of the 3′ end of the mRNA. After in vivo decay assays, RNAs were annealed to an antisense oligonucleotide against the 5′ end of the GAP-43 3′-UTR and these RNA-DNA hybrids were digested with RNase H. The resulting fragments contained either the 5′-UTR and coding region or the entire GAP-43 3′-UTR and the poly(A) tail. As shown in Fig.2, in the absence of excess HuD, both fragments decayed simultaneously with a rate similar to that of the entire mRNA. While the 5′ end consisted of a band of unique size, the 3′ end fragments showed greater heterogeneity, possibly because they contain poly(A) tails of varying sizes. This heterogeneity did not change during the decay, as 3′ fragments disappeared without an apparent change in the relative abundance of the different size species. Therefore, the broad 3′ end bands are more likely caused by the imprecise nature of the polyadenylation reaction than to a distributive deadenylation. The results in Fig. 2 also show that overexpression of HuD protein resulted in the stabilization of both fragments. The finding of similar decay rates for the 3′ and 5′ end fragments without the formation of intermediate size products could be the result of one of two alternative decay mechanisms. The first possibility is that the decay reaction is very processive. Supporting this possibility, processive deadenylation was shown to occur during the degradation of other ARE-containing mRNAs such as that for GM-CSF (31Chen C.Y., Xu, N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mRNA may be the target of endonucleolytic attack. To address these issues, subsequent studies utilized a cell-free mRNA decay system where individual components could be controlled more easily. We used a polysome-based mRNA decay system (29Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 203-209Google Scholar) to examine the effect of HuD on the half-life of in vitrosynthesized GAP-43 mRNA. Isolated polysomes are known to contain all the enzymatic activities required for mRNA degradation. Although mRNAs decay at much faster rates in vitro thanin vivo, the system faithfully reproduces the effect ofcis- and trans-acting factors on mRNA half-life (32Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In vitro decay reactions used a radiolabeled capped and polyadenylated full-length GAP-43 mRNA as the substrate. Given that other RNA-binding proteins interact with the GAP-43 mRNA (16Kohn D.T. Tsai K.-C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was important to preserve the structure of the mRNA as closely as that in the cells. Radiolabeled mRNAs were added to decay reactions containing purified polysomes from adult rat brain, in the presence or absence of recombinant HuD protein. Control reactions used recombinant GST at the same molar concentration, whereas others omitted recombinant protein altogether. Both controls yielded identical results (data not shown). Initial studies evaluated the specificity of the in vitrodecay system by examining the structural requirements for GAP-43 mRNA decay. As shown in Fig. 3, the same structural elements that are necessary for effective translation, the 5′ cap and poly(A) tail, were also required for effective mRNA degradation. In addition, swapping the GAP-43 3′-UTR for that of β-globin dramatically increased the stability of the mRNA. This is consistent with the known stabilizing effect of the β-globin 3′-UTR when attached downstream of any unstable mRNA, including that of GAP-43, and is comparable with previous observations in cultured PC12 cells (10Tsai K. Cansino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R.L. Perrone-Biozerozz N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the specificity of the in vitro system was established, we examined the effect of HuD on the half-life of full-length GAP-43 mRNAs. Similar to the results obtained in PC12 cells (Fig. 1), addition of recombinant HuD protein increased the half-life of the GAP-43 mRNA by ∼2–3-fold (Fig. 4). However, we found virtually no delay in the onset of mRNA decayin vitro, and the GAP-43 mRNA began to decay 2 min after starting the reaction. The lack of an apparent delay in the cell-free system may be caused by the increased speed of mRNA degradation, which would make it difficult to detect small delays in the decay. Alternatively, additional factors not present in the in vitro system may contribute to the delay. In any case, it is clear that the presence of excess HuD protein increases GAP-43 mRNA stability both in vivo and in vitro. There are two possible explanations for this stabilization. First, HuD could be affecting the turnover of the mRNA by binding to both the 3′-UTR and the poly(A) tail. Alternatively, the third RNA recognition motif (RRM III) could be binding to the poly(A) tail nonspecifically, preventing degradation of the messenger RNA. To test the requirement of the interaction of HuD with the GAP-43 3′-UTR in mRNA stabilization, we synthesized a mRNA in which the single 27-nucleotide HuD binding site was deleted. This mRNA (ΔHuD) was then used in decay experiments in the presence or absence of GST-HuD protein. As shown in Fig. 5, HuD did not affect the decay of GAP-43 mRNAs that lack the HuD binding site, indicating that this protein must specifically bind to its recognition site in the 3′-UTR to stabilize the GAP-43 mRNA. This is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating that mutations of the ARE of tumor necrosis factor-α abolished the capacity of HuR to stabilize the mRNA (33Di Marco S. Hel Z. Lachance C. Furneaux H. Radzioch D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 863-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5HuD does not stabilize ΔHuD, a mRNA with a deletion in the HuD binding site in the 3′-UTR. A, pΔHuD was constructed and used for in vitro transcription as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the ΔHuD mRNA was analyzed by in vitro decay assays as described in Fig. 4.B, graph showing that the rate of degradation of the GAP-43 mRNA lacking the HuD binding site did not change in presence or absence of recombinant HuD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A separate question about the in vitro reaction was whether the decay of GAP-43 mRNA proceeded in a processive manner as was found to occur in vivo. To address this question, we used H-mapping to measure the decay of the 3′ and 5′ ends of the mRNA. As shown in Fig. 6, the fragments corresponding"

This is a novel regulatory mechanism of exocytosis that might involve the activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. neuronal calcium sensor-1 phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase G-protein-coupled receptor postnuclear supernatant(s) tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate secretogranin II high performance liquid chromatography 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate capacitative Ca2+ entry phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate inositol phosphate EF-hand-containing Ca2+-binding proteins include those of the neuronal calcium sensor family. This family of relatively small proteins (<30 kDa) is expressed in neuronal and neuroendocrine cell types and includes recoverin/S-modulin, visinin, visinin-like protein, neurocalcin, hippocalcin, frequenin, and neuronal Ca2+ sensor-1 (NCS-1)1 (1Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recoverin has a well defined role in signal transduction, regulating rhodopsin phosphorylation by inhibiting rhodopsin kinase (2Allen R.D., Al- Harbi I.S. Morris J.G. Clouston P.D. O'Connell P.J. Chapman J.R. Nankivell B.J. Transplantation. 1997; 63: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the functions of the other members of this family are unclear. Frequenin markedly enhances synaptic efficacy by increasing neurotransmitter release in Drosophila (3Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and Xenopus (4Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8001-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) through unknown mechanisms. Furthermore, the expression of NCS-1 (the mammalian homologue of frequenin) in other secretory cell types such as chromaffin cells suggests a more generalized role in exocytosis (5McFerran B.W.

In a model of synaptic transmission in PC12 cells, NCS-1 potentiated ATP-mediated exocytosis of dense core granules but did not affect Ca2+-induced exocytosis in permeabilized PC12 cells, suggesting that regulation by NCS-1 may be at the level of signal transduction rather than through direct effects on the exocytotic machinery (5McFerran B.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms for such enhancement remain unknown, recent accumulating evidence suggests that NCS-1 or frequenin could modulate ion channels such as non-L-type (7Weiss J.L.

Science. 2002; 295: 2276-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and A-type K+ channel (10Nakamura T.Y. Pountney D.J. Ozaita A. Nandi S. Ueda S. Rudy B. Coetzee W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12808-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which may explain such an increased exocytosis. In addition to ion channels, NCS-1 and/or frequenin binds to multiple proteins such as G-protein receptor kinase 1 (11De Castro E. Nef S. Fiumelli H. Lenz S.E. Kawamura S. Nef P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Iacovelli L. Sallese M. Mariggio S. de Blasi A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to regulate exocytosis and to substitute for calmodulin (13Schaad N.C., De Castro E. Nef S. Hegi S. Hinrichsen R. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H. Sikkink R. Rusnak F. Sygush J. Nef P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9253-9258Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, the yeast frequenin, but not vertebrate NCS-1 (14Bartlett S.E. Reynolds A.J. Weible M. Jeromin A. Roder J. Hendry I.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to bind to and activate phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PtdIns4K) isoform (1Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This class of enzyme is key to the supply of the phospholipase C substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and therefore has the potential to regulate phosphoinositide and Ca2+ signaling mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases. The potentiation of this signaling pathway may explain the enhancement of GPCR-mediated vesicle exocytosis by NCS-1. In the current study, we sought to test this hypothesis by examining the subcellular distribution of NCS-1 and its influence on GPCR-mediated phosphoinositide, elementary and/or global Ca2+ signaling, and exocytosis in PC12 cells. The immunolocalization of NCS-1 is consistent with a role for this protein in exocytosis. Further, we demonstrate that NCS-1 enhances UTP- and bradykinin-evoked exocytosis, and this is associated with enhanced agonist-mediated phosphoinositide signaling and potentiated elementary/global Ca2+ signaling events. These data suggest that the regulation of a PtdIns4K activity by NCS-1 (1Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) occurs in mammalian cells and could be the mechanism by which this protein enhances exocytotic responses. PC12 cells were grown as described previously (15Inoue K. Kenimer J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8157-8161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To establish stable NCS-1 clones, PC12 cells were transfected with the ratncs-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number L27421) in pClNeo (kindly provided by Jan Eggermont) and selected for neomycin resistance following standard protocols. Stable clones were further characterized by Western blotting and immunofluorescence as described below. NCS-1 cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation as previously described (16Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Cell. 1990; 60: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Passafaro M. Rosa P. Sala C. Clementi F. Sher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30096-30104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were homogenized in buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm(CH3COO)2Mg, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH and supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin A). To separate the membranes from cytosol, the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 20 min in a TLA 100.3 rotor using a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge. The pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer, loaded on the top of sucrose gradients (0.3–1.2 m sucrose), and then centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min (velocity gradient). Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top of the velocity gradients. 300 μl of each fraction from 4 to 8 were pooled and loaded on second sucrose gradients (1.1–2.0 m) and centrifuged at 110,000 ×g for 18 h (equilibrium gradients). Equal aliquots (250 μl) of both gradient fractions and equal amounts of proteins of PNS prepared from wild type and NCS-1 cells were analyzed by Western blotting as described (18Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after electrophoresis, samples were electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with antibodies. The blots were then washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase. The peroxidase was detected using chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The levels of NCS-1 in the PNS were quantified by measuring the intensity of the bands in the autoradiograms using the analysis program Image 1.61 (National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA). Double immunofluorescence and confocal analysis on fixed cells were carried out as described (18Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the fixed cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and then incubated with the polyclonal anti-NCS-1 antibody and monoclonal antibodies against either synaptophysin or chromogranin B. After washing, the cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to TRITC or fluorescein isothiocyanate, washed again, and mounted on glass coverslips with Mowiol. Images were collected in the MRC-1024 laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) with ×40 or ×60 objective lenses. For comparison of double-stained patterns, images from the fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC channels were acquired independently from the same area of sample and then superimposed. Images were processed using Photoshop 4 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Immunolabeling of frozen sections prepared from fixed and sucrose-embedded NCS-1 cells was performed as described (19Calegari F. Coco S. Taverna E. Bassetti M. Verderio C. Corradi N. Matteoli M. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the soluble granular proteins, chromogranin B and secretogranin II (SgII), were as previously described (19Calegari F. Coco S. Taverna E. Bassetti M. Verderio C. Corradi N. Matteoli M. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Anti-synaptophysin antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Changes in [Ca2+]i in single cells were measured by the fura-2 method as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with minor modification (22Koizumi S. Ikeda M. Inoue K. Nakazawa K. Brain Res. 1995; 673: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, the culture medium was replaced with balanced salt solution of the following composition: 150 mmNaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4. Cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with 5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester (fura-2/AM) at room temperature (20–22 °C) in balanced salt solution for 30 min, followed by a balanced salt solution wash and a further 30-min incubation to allow de-esterification of the loaded dye. Then the coverslips were mounted on a microscope (TMD-300, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a xenon lamp and band pass filters of 340- and 360-nm wavelength. Image data, recorded by a high sensitivity silicon intensifier target camera (C-2741–08, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) were regulated by a Ca2+ analyzing system (Furusawa Laboratory Appliances). For recording subcellular Ca2+ signals, the cells were loaded with 5 μmfluo-3/AM for 30–40 min at room temperature. After a further 20–30 min for de-esterification of the acetoxymethyl ester, the coverslips were mounted on a microscope (E-600; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CSU-10 laser-scanning unit (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan) and ICCD camera (C2400-87V; Hamamatsu Photonics). Fluo-3 was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon ion laser, and the emitted fluorescence was collected at wavelengths of >515 nm). A Nikon CFI Fluor ×60 water immersion objective (1.0 numerical aperture) was used. In order to compensate for uneven distribution of the fluo-3, self ratios were calculated (Rs =F/F0), which were subsequently converted into Ca2+ concentration using the following equation. [Ca2+]i=Rs*Kd/((Kd/[Ca2+]rest)−Rs)(Eq. 1) The Kd value of fluo-3 for PC12 cells was taken to be 707 nm, which was determined by an in vivo calibration method (23Thomas D. Tovey S.C. Collins T.J. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The procedure for the measurement of released dopamine was the same as that described by Koizumi et al. (22Koizumi S. Ikeda M. Inoue K. Nakazawa K. Brain Res. 1995; 673: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The amount of dopamine released to superfusate and that remaining in the cells was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with an electrochemical detector (LC-4B; Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN). The percentage of release was calculated by dividing supernatant values by the sum of supernatant and pellet values. Subconfluent cells were labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol (3 μCi/ml) for 48 h and were equilibrated for 15 min in the presence of 10 mmLiCl before challenge with UTP. Incubations were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant was recovered and neutralized, and [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]InsPx) accumulation was assessed as described previously (24Challiss R.A.J. Jenkinson S. Mistry R. Batty I.H. Nahorski S.R. Neuroprotocols. 1993; 3: 135-144Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell residues were extracted with acidified chloroform/methanol to recover the total lipid fraction, and deacylation and separation of glycerophosphoinositol (phosphates) was performed (25Chilvers E.R. Batty I.H. Challiss R.A. Barnes P.J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Experiments to measure changes in Ins(1,4,5)P3 mass were performed as described above except that cells were not prelabeled withmyo-[3H]inositol, and LiCl was omitted from the medium (26Challiss R.A. Batty I.H. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine the level of the expression and subcellular distribution of NCS-1, wild type or NCS-1-transfected PC12 cells were initially analyzed by immunoblotting and subcellular fractionation. Using a specific antibody, the levels of NCS-1 were analyzed in two different PC12 cell clones (clones 251 and N2) and in a number of stable transfected clones obtained from N2 cells (Fig. 1A). Whereas the level of endogenous NCS-1 was similar in the wild type clones, transfection with NCS-1 resulted in markedly enhanced levels of expression in a number of selected clones. The clone selected for further investigation (from here on referred to as NCS-1 cells) expressed ∼6 times more NCS-1 than the wild type N2 cells. Data from subcellular fractionation indicated a broad distribution of NCS-1 in transfected cells. As reported (5McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a certain portion of NCS-1 was soluble in the cytosol. To study the distribution of the portion of protein associated with cellular organelles, the PNS were subjected to high speed centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer. These were then analyzed by subcellular fractionation using two-step gradients. Analysis of the fractions obtained from the first (velocity) gradients, which separates organelles according to their size, revealed a broad distribution of NCS-1. In these velocity gradients, two peaks of NCS-1 were observed: one in the lighter fractions and the second in fractions 7–9 (Fig.1B). This distribution is similar to that of synaptophysin, a protein present in the membrane of vesicles highly related to synaptic vesicles (referred to as synaptic-like microvesicles) (27Thomas-Reetz A.C. De Camilli P. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and known to recycle through the early endosomal compartment in PC12 cells (28Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A well known marker of the secretory granules, SgII (30Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), peaked in fractions 4–8, where some synaptophysin and NCS-1 were also present. In order to further analyze whether a portion of NCS-1 could be present in the membranes of secretory granules, aliquots of fractions 4–8 were collected and loaded on the equilibrium gradients in order to achieve separation of organelles according to their density. Western blotting analysis of the fractions from these gradients revealed the presence of NCS-1 mainly in the earlier fractions. This distribution was again very similar to that of synaptophysin. There was no colocalization of NCS-1 with the marker for secretory granules, SgII, which was in the denser fractions. The cellular localization of NCS-1 in stably transfected PC12 cells was also studied by immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, when NCS-1 cells were labeled with NCS-1 antibodies, intense immunofluorescence was seen in a large number of cells (about 60%). The immunostaining for NCS-1 was partially diffuse in the positive cells in agreement with its partial distribution in the cytosol (Fig.2, A and B) (5McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The anti-NCS-1 antibody also gave a punctate staining and showed partial colocalization with the immunostaining pattern of synaptophysin (see Fig. 2, A–A″). In contrast, very little colocalization was observed with the immunofluorescent pattern of chromogranin B, a well known marker for the secretory granules of PC12 cells (Fig. 2, B–B″). In addition, NCS-1 immunostaining was observed at the periphery of the positive cells, raising the possibility that a certain amount of the protein could be bound to the plasma membrane. To confirm this possibility, ultrathin frozen sections prepared from NCS-1 cells were immunolabeled with anti-NCS-1 antibodies and secondarily labeled with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 5-nm gold particles. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, this revealed intracellular NCS-1 immunoreactivity, with gold particles distributed both in the cytoplasm and on small clear vesicles and tubules. In line with the immunofluorescence data, some gold particles were also found to decorate the plasma membrane, thus confirming the presence of NCS-1 at the cell surface in NCS-1 cells. Stimulation of PC12 cells with the P2Y2-selective agonist UTP results in the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the subsequent generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Indeed, U73122 (10 μm), an inhibitor of PLC, substantially decreased the UTP-evoked elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the cells. In the presence ofU73122, the UTP-evoked [Ca2+]i was decreased by 93.3 ± 0.5% (n = 53 cells from two independent experiments). In PC12 cells, the normal consequence of UTP stimulation is the rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive stores, followed by a more sustained Ca2+ entry across plasma membrane in response to store depletion (capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE)) (31Koizumi S. Nakazawa K. Inoue K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 1502-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the current study, a brief UTP stimulation caused a transient pattern of [Ca2+]i elevation consistent with Ca2+ mobilization and CCE in both vector-transfected control and NCS-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). However, UTP was significantly more potent in NCS-1 cells than in control cells (EC50 = 19 and 81 μm, respectively). Furthermore, the maximal [Ca2+]i responses evoked by 300 μm UTP were significantly greater in NCS-1 cells than control cells (363 ± 52 nmversus269 ± 31 nm, p < 0.05). The enhancement of Ca2+ responses was not a clonal artifact, because in another NCS-1-expressing clonal cell line (clone 3) whose NCS-1 levels are greater than control but less than that of NCS-1 cells, UTP was more potent than in control cells (Fig. 3A, c). Bradykinin also elevates [Ca2+]iin PC12 cells via the PLC-coupled bradykinin B2 receptor (32Appell K.C. Barefoot D.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar to the UTP-mediated responses, bradykinin elevated [Ca2+]i in NCS-1 cells more potently than in control cells (EC50 values; 6.0 and 8.5 nm, respectively), and the maximal response was again enhanced (315 ± 34 nmversus 232 ± 21 nm, p < 0.05; 100 nm bradykinin) (Fig.3B). This enhancement by NCS-1 of both UTP- and bradykinin-evoked Ca2+ signaling in NCS-1 cells was also apparent in the absence of extracellular Ca2+(Ca2+o) (Fig. 3, A (b) and B (b)), indicating that the Ca2+release process had itself been potentiated. U73122 (10 μm) also inhibited the Ca2+ responses to UTP in NCS-1 cells ([Ca2+]i elevation was 5.3 ± 0.62% of that with UTP alone; n = 52 cells from two independent experiments). In contrast to these differences in UTP- and bradykinin-evoked responses between NCS-1 cells and control cells, the elevations in [Ca2+]i evoked by depolarization with high K+ (25–100 mm) were almost identical in control and NCS-1 cells (Fig. 3B, a). To ascertain whether the CCE process per se was affected by NCS-1, we determined CCE directly in control and NCS-1 cells. CCE was activated by inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum using cyclopiazonic acid (30 μm). The elevations of [Ca2+]i induced by cyclopiazonic acid were not different in control and NCS-1 cells (Fig. 3C, a and d; 117.2 + 16.5% of control, p > 0.05, n = 32 cells), indicating that CCE per se was unaffected by overexpression of NCS-1. We next monitored Ca2+ release and CCE separately to investigate the relationship between UTP-evoked Ca2+release and Ca2+ entry. In the absence of Ca2+o, UTP produced concentration-dependent elevations of [Ca2+]i in both control and NCS-1 cells (Fig.3C, b and e). After the removal of UTP, readdition of Ca2+o produced a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i, which slowly returned to basal levels after ∼10 min. This rise was a consequence of CCE and was dependent upon the initial UTP concentration (Fig. 3C, b, c, e, and f). In other words, the extent of CCE is related to the extent of the UTP-mediated store depletion. In addition to Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors, PC12 cells express functional type 2 ryanodine receptors on intracellular Ca2+stores (33Bennett D.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cheek T.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Koizumi S. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activation of these Ca2+ release channels with 40 mm caffeine caused a rapid transient elevation in [Ca2+]i of similar magnitude in control and NCS-1 cells (85.7 ± 19.2% of control, n = 23 cells from two independent experiments). Since we have reported that luminal [Ca2+] affects the activity of both Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors and ryanodine receptors in PC12 cells (35Koizumi S. Bootman M.D. Bobanovic L.K. Schell M.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 36Koizumi S. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the Ca2+ contents of the intracellular stores in control and NCS-1 cells were compared. In the absence of Ca2+o, ionomycin (5 μm) releases almost all Ca2+ from the intracellular stores of PC12 cells (37Fasolato C. Zottini M. Clementi E. Zacchetti D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20159-20167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NCS-1 cells, ionomycin-mediated elevations in [Ca2+]i were similar to those in control cells (96.1 ± 6.3% of control, n = 32 cells from two independent experiments), indicating similar luminal Ca2+contents in the two cell lines. Elementary Ca2+ release signals, such as puffs and sparks, are the building blocks for global Ca2+ signals (38Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 39Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell. 1997; 91: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Such elementary events have been observed in a wide variety of cell types including PC12 cells (35Koizumi S. Bootman M.D. Bobanovic L.K. Schell M.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, using confocal microscopy, we investigated whether overexpression of NCS-1 affects elementary Ca2+ release events. Elementary Ca2+signals were observed spontaneously (Fig.4B, left traces), and these were facilitated upon stimulation with UTP concentrations (0.1 or 0.3 μm) that were subthreshold for global Ca2+ signaling. These elementary Ca2+ events were observed even in the absence of Ca2+o, suggesting that they were mainly due to Ca2+ release from Ca2+ stores. Low concentration (0.3 μm) of UTP increased both the number of responding cells and the number of active elementary Ca2+ release sites (Fig. 4C), and enhanced the event amplitude and frequency (Fig. 4D). When NCS-1 cells were stimulated with higher (e.g. 3 μm) concentrations of UTP, these elementary events were followed by global Ca2+ signals (Fig. 4, E and F). In control cells, spontaneous elementary Ca2+ events also occurred, but there were no significant differences with NCS-1 cells in either the proportion of cells in which events were observed or the event amplitude. However, in control cells, 0.3 μm UTP activated fewer additional elementary Ca2+ release sites in fewer cells. Furthermore, the frequency of UTP-stimulated elementary events was lower than that seen in NCS-1 cells. These data demonstrate that overexpression of NCS-1 enhanced elementary Ca2+release events mediated by PLC-linked GPCRs, and as a consequence the NCS-1-expressing cells displayed global Ca2+ signals at low levels of stimulation. UTP evokes the release of dopamine from PC12 cells (31Koizumi S. Nakazawa K. Inoue K. Br. J. Pharmaco"
https://openalex.org/W2319635879,"TGFbeta overexpression in human cancer cells has been shown to promote tumor progression. In the present study, we sought to determine whether sequestration of endogenous TGFbeta by the expression of a soluble TGFbeta type III receptor (sRIII), can reduce malignancy in human carcinoma cells and whether the tumor-suppressive activity of sRIII is associated with the inhibition of angiogenesis. Ectopic expression of sRIII significantly inhibited the growth of tumors formed by human colon carcinoma HCT116 and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-435 cells in nude mice. It also reduced the metastatic potential of the MDA-MB-435 cells. Thus, endogenous TGFbeta appears to be necessary for the progression of these two carcinomas. Furthermore, when the tumor cells were mixed with Matrigel and embedded subcutaneously in nude mice, the blood volume in Matrigel plugs containing sRIII-expressing cells as indicated by hemoglobin levels was significantly lower than that in Matrigel plugs containing the respective control cells. Blood vessel counts in paraffin sections of the Matrigel plugs containing sRIII-expressing cells were also significantly lower than those in paraffin sections of the Matrigel plugs containing control cells. Treatment of human endothelial cells with a recombinant sRIII significantly inhibited their ability to form a capillary web structure on Matrigel. These results for the first time indicate that the sRIII-induced tumor suppression appears to be in part due to the inhibition of angiogenesis."

Plasminogen activators, their inhibitors, and their cell-surface receptor(s) play central roles in these processes by regulating extracellular proteolysis, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. In tissues, extracellular proteolysis is controlled by the production of plasmin that is generated by plasminogen activators, mainly urokinase (uPA)1 (1Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Romer J. Almholt K. Dano K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), which binds to a specific membrane receptor, uPAR. Fully processed human uPAR is a 45–55-kDa glycoprotein linked to the outer membrane leaflet by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchor (2Ploug M. Rønne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein is composed of three homologous domains with a disulfide bonding pattern characteristic of the uPAR/Ly-6 superfamily (3Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides providing the cells with the means to perform directed extracellular matrix degradation, binding of uPA to uPAR has profound effects on cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (4Ossowski L.

Although binding to uPAR is always required, these latter processes are often independent of the proteolytic activity of uPA, strongly suggesting that other protein interactions are involved. Indeed, several data indicate that a conformational change in uPAR is capable of profoundly modifying its biological properties. First, it has been shown that uPA binding to uPAR causes the appearance of novel binding sites for vitronectin (Vn) (7Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

However, although extensive evidence has been presented that uPAR entertains complex interactions with other proteins, very little is known about how these interactions are regulated at the molecular level. In this paper we have addressed the possibility that uPA binding influences uPAR oligomerization and that uPAR oligomerization is a major determinant for its interaction with other proteins. As a paradigm, we have employed the ability of uPAR to bind Vn, a function that has been shown previously to induce cell adhesion (7Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sidenius N. Blasi F.

A soluble variant of uPAR (residues 1–277) was expressed and purified from culture supernatants of transfected CHO cells as described previously (16Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). SuPAR/FLAG was purified from transiently transfected COS-7 cells as described previously (17Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Pro-uPA, purified from eukaryotic cell culture supernatants, was a kind gift from Dr. Jack Henkin (Abbott). The amino-terminal fragments (ATF) of uPA and LMW-uPA were obtained from American Diagnostica. The growth factor-like domain of uPA (GFD, amino acids 1–48) was a kind gift from Dr. Steve Rosenberg. The exact molarity of suPAR and pro-uPA was established by amino acid analysis (Research Consortium Inc.) Urea-purified vitronectin was purchased from Promega. The monoclonal antibody R2 was kindly provided by Dr. Gunilla Høyer-Hansen (Finsen Laboratories, Copenhagen, Denmark). The monoclonal antibody M2 and thepNPP substrate were obtained from Sigma. Secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences (peroxidase-conjugated) and Dako (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated). Binding assays were performed in 96-well plates (NUNC Maxisorb) coated with Vn (0.1 ml/well, 1 μg/ml in 0.05m phosphate buffer, pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 0.15 ml of 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h. All subsequent incubations were performed with reagents diluted in dilution buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA) at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Initially, wells were incubated with suPAR and other reagents diluted to the indicated concentrations for 1 h at room temperature (Note: as described under “Results,” the way that reagents are mixed is important in determining the level of Vn binding obtained. To minimize possible experimental variability caused by this fact, the reagents were always mixed from 2-fold concentrated stocks (when 2 reagents were to be tested together) or 3-fold concentrated stocks (when 3 reagents were to be tested together), etc. and allowed to sit for >30 min at room temperature before being transferred to the Vn-coated wells.) After extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the wells were probed for bound suPAR or suPAR/FLAG (as indicated) using monoclonal antibodies (2 μg/ml) specific for the relevant molecule (R2 and M2, respectively) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the wells were probed for bound antibody by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:1000. After another round of washing, bound alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed using the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate and quantified by measuring the absorbance of samples at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader. The binding data from the experiments shown in Fig. 1 were fitted by minimizing square errors to a simple equilibrium model: {(i) L + R ↔ LR; (ii) RL + R ↔ LR2}, where L and R represent pro-uPA (ligand) and suPAR (receptor), respectively, and total suPAR binding to Vn is represented byB = a[LR2] +b[LR]. In order to fit the data it was necessary to allow for a ±25% error in the estimates of the relative concentrations of pro-uPA and suPAR, perhaps being due to loss of the reagent because of marginal unspecific binding to the substrate, or to other causes. For calculations of the predicted curves presented in Fig. 1, a concentration correction factor of 0.76 for pro-uPA was used. Computations were performed in the Mathlab software environment (Matworks, Natik, MA) on a personal computer. For immunoprecipitation analysis the indicated concentrations of suPAR, suPAR/FLAG, pro-uPA, ATF, or GFD were mixed in dilution buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. SuPAR/FLAG was then immunoprecipitated by addition of 20 μl of M2-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubation under gentle agitation for 1 h. After extensive washing of the beads with PBS-T, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, size-fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electroblotting (19Kyhse Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS-T, Western blots were developed by sequential incubations with biotinylated R2 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, followed by chemiluminescent detection. suPAR, pro-uPA, and suPAR·pro-uPA complexes were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography using a SuperdexTM 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). A sample volume of 20 μl was loaded onto the column that was developed with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl using a flow rate of 60 μl/min. The elution profile was recorded by measuring the absorbance of the eluted sample at 280 nm. The column was calibrated by measuring the retention times of several standard substances, calculating their corresponding K av values, and plotting theirK av values versus the logarithm of their molecular weights. The equation used to calculateK av was K av = (V e − V o )/(V t − V o ), where V e is the elution volume of the protein, V o the column void volume (= elution volume of blue dextran 2000), and V t the total bed volume (2.4 ml). The apparent molecular weights of pro-uPA, suPAR, and the 1:1 complex were determined by linear regression. The calibration molecules, their molecular weights, and their retention times (mean of two determinations ± S.D.) are as follows: thyroglobulin, 669 kDa, RT = 17.55 ± 0.08 min; ferritin, 440 kDa, 20.07 ± 0.02 min; catalase, 232 kDa, 22.41 ± 0.01 min; aldolase, 158 kDa, 22.83 ± 0.04 min; BSA, 67 kDa, 24.55 ± 0.02 min; ovalbumin, 43 kDa, 26.00 ± 0.04 min; chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa, 28.75 ± 0.01 min; ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa, 28.75 ± 0.01 min; and blue dextran 2000, >2000 kDa, 14.79 ± 0.06 min. To study the mechanism of uPAR binding to Vn, we have exploited a simplein vitro binding assay in which Vn-coated plastic surfaces are incubated with suPAR in the presence or absence of the reagents to be tested. After removal of unbound reagents, bound suPAR was quantitated by sequential incubations with reagent-specific primary antibodies, secondary enzyme-conjugated antibodies, and finally a colorimetric substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this assay, suPAR displays specific, high affinity, and ligand-dependent binding to Vn (Fig.1 A), indicating that the high affinity Vn-binding form of uPAR is a complex between uPAR and pro-uPA (7Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, although pro-uPA was clearly required for suPAR binding to Vn, it was also strongly inhibitory when present in excess of suPAR. This suggests that the mechanism of suPAR binding to immobilized Vn was more complex than a simple reaction in which one molecule of suPAR binds one molecule of pro-uPA forming a heterodimeric high affinity Vn-binding complex. To exclude the possibility that this unusual dose dependence of binding was an artifact caused by our detection system, we repeated the experiments using different antibodies to detect bound suPAR (a polyclonal rabbit antibody and two different mouse monoclonal antibodies), as well as using 125I-radiolabeled suPAR in which case no secondary reagent was required. However, independent of the method of detection, qualitatively identical binding curves were observed in all cases (results not shown), demonstrating that the behavior of the binding curves indeed reflects the ligand dependence of suPAR binding to immobilized Vn. To address the ligand dependence of suPAR binding to Vn, we further analyzed the extent of suPAR binding to immobilized Vn and its dependence on pro-uPA concentration (Fig. 1 B). No binding of suPAR was observed in the absence of low concentrations of pro-uPA. With increasing pro-uPA, we found a linear increase in suPAR binding, the extent of which was dependent only on the pro-uPA concentration (in the initial tract the curves superimpose for all concentrations of suPAR). Binding reached a maximum at a pro-uPA concentration close to one-half of the suPAR concentration and then declined at higher pro-uPAs. This suggests the existence of an optimal pro-uPA:suPAR stoichiometry for Vn binding, possibly 1:2. At pro-uPA concentrations above those of suPAR, the curves settle to a plateau close to one-third of the maximum, suggesting the formation of complex with 1:1 stoichiometry, less efficient in binding Vn. Curves of suPAR binding to Vn for increasing concentrations of suPAR (Fig. 1 C) rise linearly at suPAR concentrations up to one-half pro-uPA concentration (and superimpose at all concentrations of pro-uPA). At higher suPAR concentrations the slopes increase (and more so for higher pro-uPA concentrations) until the curves rather abruptly plateau at suPAR concentrations about twice those of pro-uPA. This again points to an optimal 1:2 pro-uPA:suPAR stoichiometry for Vn binding. The region of linear increase in Vn binding (pro-uPA/suPAR >1/2) and the more than linear increase between stoichiometry 2:1 and 1:2 again point to lower binding efficiency for complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry. Qualitatively, the experimental data thus suggest that suPAR binding to Vn may be explained by the binding of two stoichiometrically different pro-uPA·suPAR complexes. A high affinity 1:2 complex forms when suPAR is in excess of pro-uPA, and a low affinity 1:1 complex preferentially forms when pro-uPA is in excess of suPAR. To address mathematically the validity of this mechanism, a simple equilibrium model was fit to the experimental data shown in Reactions 1 and 2, L+R↔KD(i)LRReaction 1 LR+R↔KD(ii)LR2Reaction 2 where L and R represent pro-uPA and suPAR, respectively, and total suPAR binding to Vn is represented by B =a[LR2] + b[LR]. The effectiveness ratio (b/a) represents the relative Vn binding activity of the LR and LR2 complexes. The curves predicted by this model were slightly sensitive to theK D values for Reactions 1 and 2, and best fits were obtained for low values of these parameters, K D (ii) <10−10 and K D (i) even lower (some 50-fold). This suggests that binding under the applied experimental conditions might constitute an almost irreversible reaction, and an equilibrium model might not be the best way to describe the system. However, most aspects of the experimental binding data represented in Fig. 1 were fully and quantitatively accounted for by this model. Experimental estimates are available in the literature for the affinity of the uPA/uPAR interaction (K D (i) ≈10−10m (20Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28532-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). Therefore, fits were recalculated by constraining K D (i) to this value (Fig. 1, B and C, dotted lines). The resulting estimate for K D (ii) was 0.77 nm, and an effectiveness ratio (b/a) of 0.061 was estimated for binding ofLR and LR 2 complexes to Vn. As can be seen in Fig. 1, crossing of the curves in B and the decrease to plateau in A are well predicted. Although the above binding model closely predicts the binding curves, it should be noted that it does not take into account the likely presence of different multimeric forms of Vn in the binding assay. In fact, it is possible that the high affinity pro-uPA·suPAR·Vn complex may have a 1:2:2 stoichiometry and the low affinity complex an 1:1:1 stoichiometry, etc. However, binding experiments using different preparations of Vn (native and denatured) resulted in identical binding curves (data not shown) suggesting that after adsorption to plastic Vn exposes the same suPAR binding epitopes independently of its original state of oligomerization. Pro-uPA has also been reported previously (25Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to interact directly with Vn, and we therefore addressed the alternative possibility that pro-uPA in some way competes for an overlapping binding site on Vn. However, for several reasons this could not explain the inhibitory effect. First, the inhibitory effect of pro-uPA (Fig. 1) occurs at concentrations well below its apparent K m value for Vn (97 nm (25Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Second, the minimal concentration of pro-uPA required to observe inhibition was not fixed but correlated with the concentration of suPAR (Fig. 1). Third, preincubation of immobilized Vn with pro-uPA failed to prevent the concomitant binding of pro-uPA·suPAR complexes (Fig.2 A,columns F–I). Another possibility is that pro-uPA causes the release of pro-uPA·suPAR complexes from Vn. This might, for example, occur by proteolytic cleavage of suPAR by trace amounts of active two-chain uPA present in the pro-uPA preparation. However, even this did not explain the inhibitory effect as pro-uPA·suPAR complexes bound to Vn were resistant to release by an excess of free pro-uPA (Fig. 2 A, columns J–M). Taken together the data suggest that suPAR binding to Vn is inhibited by elevated pro-uPA due to a shift from binding-competent to less effective pro-uPA·suPAR complexes for binding to Vn. To test this possibility we performed binding experiments using pre-formed pro-uPA·suPAR complexes containing optimal amounts of pro-uPA and suPAR (Fig. 2 B). After a 1-h incubation, these pre-formed complexes were supplemented with increasing concentrations of pro-uPA, incubated for another hour, and then assayed for Vn binding activity (Fig. 2 B, columns F–H). For comparison, we analyzed the reaction having the same final concentrations of both components, but prepared without the two-step addition of pro-uPA (Fig.2 B, columns B–E). Indeed, the capacity of excess pro-uPA to inhibit suPAR binding to Vn was strongly reduced when the pro-uPA·suPAR complexes were allowed to form before the addition of the excess pro-uPA. These data demonstrate that what determines the level of suPAR binding to Vn is the ratio between suPAR and pro-uPA and not the absolute concentration of the two proteins. Consequently, the pro-uPA·suPAR complexes that bind with high affinity to Vn cannot be simple 1:1 complexes. A fundamental prediction of the model used to explain the binding data is the existence of complexes between pro-uPA and two (or more) molecules of suPAR. To address this possibility directly, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using two different epitope-tagged suPAR preparations (Fig. 3). We had previously constructed, expressed, and purified a suPAR variant in which a short peptide epitope had been engineered onto Pro-274 of uPAR generating a recognition epitope for the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (10Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The addition of this epitope involved the removal of the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids (Asp-Leu-Asp, amino acids 275–277) present on “wild-type” suPAR (amino acids 1–277), and resulted in the complete destruction of the recognition epitope for the monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody R2. In contrast to the differential recognition by monoclonal antibodies, these two suPAR variants (from here on termed suPAR and suPAR/FLAG) display indistinguishable pro-uPA and Vn binding (Fig. 3 and results not shown). We mixed the two forms of suPAR and immunoprecipitated the mixture with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody. When the immunoprecipitate was blotted with R2 antibody, R2 did not recognize any protein in the M2 precipitate (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). However, in the presence of pro-uPA, suPAR was readily identified in the M2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3 A, lane 8). The specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation procedure was verified by immunoprecipitation of samples in which one, two, or all three reactants had been omitted (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–6). In these samples no R2 reactive material was observed. We next compared the pro-uPA dose dependence of suPAR co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 B) and Vn binding (Fig.3 C). In these experiments an exact correlation between suPAR oligomerization, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation, and Vn binding was observed, demonstrating that the generation of the high affinity Vn-binding complex involves pro-uPA-induced suPAR oligomerization. As the suPAR:suPAR co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the existence of higher order suPAR·pro-uPA complexes in the absence of Vn, we next sought to identify these complexes by size exclusion chromatography. To this end we subjected purified suPAR, pro-uPA, and mixtures of the two proteins to analytical gel filtration on a SuperdexTM 200 column (Fig.4 A). Analyzed individually, both suPAR (dotted curves) and pro-uPA (gray curves) filtered as single peaks with highly reproducible retention times (24.80 ± 0.07 (n = 3) and 27.67 ± 0.04 (n = 3) min, respectively). When mixtures of the suPAR and pro-uPA were analyzed (black curves), a single new peak (retention time, 22.91 ± 0.02 min (n = 5)), corresponding to the 1:1 pro-uPA·suPAR complex was observed. No other complexes could be identified. Furthermore, no apparent difference in the retention time of the pro-uPA·suPAR complex could be observed when the complex was formed in the presence of excess pro-uPA (22.91 ± 0.01 min (n = 2)) or in the presence of excess suPAR (22.92 ± 0.01 min (n = 2)). To exclude that the failure to detect ternary complexes by gel filtration was caused by a lack of resolution, the column performance was validated using mixtures of reference proteins (Fig. 4 B). In these experiments an excellent resolution was observed with a linear correlation (correlation coefficient 0.99) between the K avand the log-transformed molecular weights of the reference proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on the calibrations curve, the relative molecular masses of pro-uPA, suPAR, and the 1:1 complex were calculated to be 28.1 ± 0.6, 75.2 ± 1.1, and 144.2 ± 2.2 kDa, respectively. It thus appears that in contrast to pro-uPA, which behaves as a very compact molecule, both suPAR and the 1:1 complex may have an extended (non-spherical) shape in solution. Within the presented series of gel filtrations, the maximal difference in retention time between independent runs of the same protein (11 different proteins) was 0.13 min. A reduction in the retention time for the 1:1 pro-uPA·suPAR complex of twice this size (0.26 min) translated into a molecular mass increase of 13.4 kDa (9.2%). We therefore concluded that if the ternary complex had formed stoichiometrically, we would have observed it even if its molecular size was only marginally different from that of the 1:1 complex. The gel filtrations presented in Fig. 4 were all performed in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl to prevent interactions between the solid phase and pro-uPA which was otherwise observed at physiological salt concentrations (data not shown). This is unlikely to explain the failure to detect higher order complexes as suPAR binding to Vn was unaffected under these conditions (data not shown). Although the use of physiological salt concentrations did not allow a quantitative recovery of injected pro-uPA, both suPAR and pro-uPA·suPAR complexes filtered normally under these conditions (not shown). However, even under these conditions no material eluting prior to the 1:1 complex was ever observed (not shown). The gel filtration experiments thus indicated that either the higher order pro-uPA·suPAR complexes are only marginally larger that the 1:1 complex or not abundant enough for detection using this method. In any case the gel filtration experiments allowed us to compare the relative abundance of free pro-uPA, suPAR, and pro-uPA·suPAR complexes, with the Vn binding activity. To this end, aliquots of the samples applied to the gel filtration column were diluted and assayed for their Vn binding activity (Fig. 4 C). Samples containing excess suPAR (filtrations I and II) displayed approximately twice the Vn bindin"

We report here, for the first time, the identification of p75-associated kinase that mediates NGF-driven NF-κB activation. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate an NGF-dependent association of interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) with the p75 neurotrophin receptor in PC12 cells. Our results reveal that IRAK is recruited to the p75-NGF receptor leading to formation of a complex between IRAK, atypical protein kinase C interacting protein, p62, and TRAF6. Activation of NF-κB occurs predominantly through the p75 receptor, and TrkA activity suppresses NF-κB activation and retards IκBβ degradation. In addition, we observe a requirement for the kinase activity of IRAK in mediating NGF-induced NF-κB activation, recruitment of the adapter protein p62 to the p75 receptor, and cell survival. Moreover, p75-IRAK-mediated κB activation and the recruitment of IKKβ, but not IKKα, to the receptor require p62.

Activation of NF-κB by an external stimulus involves phosphorylation and rapid degradation of IκB proteins by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα are the most well characterized stimuli that lead to the activation of NF-κB.Binding of interleukin-1 (IL-1) to its receptor promotes the association of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) with the receptor (4Cao Z.

Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). These kinases define a subgroup of cytoplasmic kinases called the serine/threonine innate immunity kinases (SIIK) group (9Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). IRAK is a multidomain protein containing an N-terminal death domain of 120 amino acids, a central 300-amino acid kinase domain, and an undetermined C-terminal domain that is absent in pelle (10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Two other IRAK-related proteins IRAK-2 and IRAK-M (for its higher levels of expression in cells of monocytic lineage), have been found in humans (8Weshe H. Gao X., Li, X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R.

Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Properties of IRAK resemble the serine/threonine kinase RIP, implicated in TNF signaling. TNF-R1 signaling to NF-κB activation is in part reported to be mediated by recruitment of mPLK, which, based upon chromosomal location and sequence identity, is the mouse homologue of the human IRAK (12Vig E. Green M. Liu Y. Donner D.B. Mukaida N. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13077-13084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In addition to IL-1 and TNFα, treatment of neuronal cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes NF-κB activation (13Wooten M.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), by binding to two distinct receptors, TrkA and p75. We demonstrated previously that in the NGF NF-κB activation pathway, the atypical PKC binding protein p62 serves as a scaffold by linking p75-TRAF6 and TrkA receptor components (13Wooten M.W.

Although TrkA has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (14Meakin S.O. Shooter E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), the p75 receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, has no known intrinsic kinase activity (15Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar, 16Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L.

Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Moreover, p75 has been shown to signal independently of TrkA in the NF-κB pathway and enhance the survival response of sensory neurons to NGF (18Hamnoue M. Middleton G. Wyatt S. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Davies A.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, we searched for a p75-associated kinase that mediates NGF-induced NF-κB signaling. We report here, for the first time, an NGF-dependent association of IRAK with p75 in PC12 cells leading to NF-κB activation. We demonstrate that IRAK is a critical component of this pathway. Overexpression of catalytically active IRAK in PC12 cells enhances cell survival, whereas catalytically inactive IRAK blocks activation of NF-κB through a mechanism whereby the association of the p62 scaffold was blocked from its association with the p75 receptor.DISCUSSIONA number of protein kinases have been known to associate with p75 (46Ohmichi M. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A 120/104-kDa kinase has been reported as a predominant protein kinase that co-immunoprecipitates with the p75 receptor in PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation (23Canossa M. Twiss J.L. Verity A.N. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the kinase remained elusive. We report here the identification of a 100/104-kDa serine/threonine kinase that co-immunoprecipitates with p75 in NGF-treated PC12 cells. In addition, the similarity in molecular weight and the ability of the kinase to co-immunoprecipitate with p75 receptor upon NGF stimulation suggests that the 104-kDa kinase previously reported by Canossa et al. (23Canossa M. Twiss J.L. Verity A.N. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) could likely be the 104-kDa kinase identified by us as IRAK.IRAK was initially shown to be a critical player in the IL-1 signaling pathway of NF-κB. The N-terminal region (residues 1–198) and the C-terminal region (residues 523–618) have been shown to be required for the IL-1-induced binding of IRAK to TRAF6 (31Li X. Cammane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Kinase activity of IRAK is not required for its function in the IL-1 system (12Vig E.

Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast to the IL-1 signaling pathway, the catalytic activity of mPLK/IRAK has been reported to be critical for TNF signaling (12Vig E. Green M. Liu Y. Donner D.B. Mukaida N. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13077-13084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study we show for the first time that overexpression of mPLK/IRAK can constitutively induce NGF-mediated NF-κB activation. Our results also demonstrate that, in NGF signaling, the kinase activity of mPLK/IRAK is required for NF-κB activation. Evolutionary conservation of IRAK structure and function reported between different species (4Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar,47Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and receptor systems may cause an even stronger overlap of their biological functions. Functional studies performed by us revealed that the catalytic activity of IRAK is required for p75-mediated NF-κB activation as well as NGF-mediated activation of NF-κB. In parallel, the catalytic activity of IRAK appears to be required for NGF-mediated survival of PC12 cells.Six different TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) have been identified so far of which TRAF2 and TRAF5 have been implicated in activating NF-κB in response to TNF-α. TRAF6 has been shown to be a signal transducer for the IL-1 receptor superfamily (6Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 48Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C., Ho, A. Morony S. Van Capparelli C.G. Kaufman S. Vander Haiden A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Although TRAF2 is recruited by receptor interacting protein (RIP) in TNF signaling, TRAF6 is recruited by IRAK (6Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). In addition, p62/ZIP interacts with TRAF6 and RIP in IL-1 and TNF signaling pathways, respectively (22Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Nakano H. Mosact J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sanz L. Sanchez P. Lallena M.-J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3044-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Previous reports have confirmed an interaction of TRAF6 with p75 (24Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Here we extend this observation and show an NGF-mediated association of TRAF6 and the atypical PKC interacting protein, p62, with IRAK. Furthermore, we find that IRAK-mediated κB activation and cell survival could be blocked in NGF signaling by the antisense construct of p62, thus suggesting that p62 is a downstream transducer of the p75-NGF/IRAK-mediated κB activation pathway. In addition, we demonstrate here that p62 is necessary for coupling of IκB kinase, IKKβ, with the p75-NGF receptor. The mechanisms whereby the IKKs are regulated are not yet completely understood. Ubiquitination, in addition to phosphorylation, has been shown to play a regulatory role in IKK activation. It was shown recently that TRAF6 functions as a ubiquitin ligase (E3), which, together with the E2 Ubc13/Uev1A, mediates the assembly of K63-linked polyUb chains required for IKK activation (49Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the ubiquitin binding property of p62 may also be relevant in regulating IKK activation.The NF-κB signaling pathway is conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates (8Weshe H. Gao X., Li, X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 50Wasserman S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The components of Toll signaling pathway, Toll, tube, pelle, dorsal, and cactus, which function to form the dorsal-ventral axis in the Drosophila embryo, show significant homology with IL-1R, MyD88, IRAK, NF-κB, and IκB of the IL-1 signaling pathway (51Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). A Drosophila homologue of TRAF protein (DTRAF-1) was recently identified (52Zapata J.M. Matsuzawa S.-I. Godzik A. Leo E. Wasserman S.A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12102-12107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our present study demonstrating the presence of a homologous signaling pathway in the NGF system reinforces the notion that the NF-κB signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved. The most striking feature that distinguishes IL-1- and NGF-mediated NF-κB activation seems to be the requirement of IRAK kinase activity in NGF signaling but not in IL-1 signaling. In this context p75-NGF receptor-mediated signaling shares greater homology with TNF signaling than IL-1 signaling, which could be due to the high degree of sequence similarity between TNF and p75 receptors (15Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar, 17Feinstein E. Kimichi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 53Rabizadeh S., Oh, J. Zhong L.T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note the requirement for the catalytic activity of IRAK exhibited by p75 for activation of NF-κB as well as survival signaling. In cells deficient in IRAK, NGF failed to activate NF-κB (Fig. 5 C) with a parallel reduction in NGF-induced survival (Fig. 7 B). Collectively, these findings support a role for the catalytic activity of IRAK as a bifunctional switch for p75-mediated survival in PC12 cells.Based upon these findings we propose a model for how IRAK signals NF-κB activation in the NGF system (Fig.8). Under basal conditions, IRAK is a cytoplasmic inactive kinase not bound to the receptor. Upon stimulation with NGF, an MyD88·IRAK complex forms that is recruited to the p75 receptor. After recruiting IRAK, MyD88 leaves the receptor complex. At the time of recruitment to the p75 receptor, IRAK is rapidly phosphorylated and activated by an unknown mechanism. NGF-induced activation of IRAK leads to recruitment of TRAF6 followed by binding of p62. Moreover, the kinase activity of IRAK is necessary for recruitment of p62 to the receptor complex to engage the NF-κB pathway. Our findings reveal that p75 is capable of activating NF-κB (Figs. 4,A–C, and 5 C). Co-expression of TrkA with p75 appears to suppress the kinetics and magnitude of the NF-κB response (Fig. 4 B), which is suppressed when TrkA is inhibited as noted by increased degradation of IκBβ. These findings further explain previous NGF-induced activation kinetics for the κB pathway (54Cosgaya J.M. Shooter E.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 55Wood J.N. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 192: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ability of p75 to engage the survival signaling pathway (Fig. 7, A and B) is consistent with its ability to activate NF-κB (Figs. 4 and 5). Additionally, use of the NGF 9/13 mutant, which fails to activate TrkA autophosphorylation, reveals that p75 is able to signal for survival autonomously of TrkA (56Hughes A.L. Messineo D. Lad S.P. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of K252a to enhance survival or block NGF-dependent survival is dose-dependent (57Buck H. Winter J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In our study we have used naı̈ve PC12 cells to examine NGF-dependent survival (Fig. 7 A), whereas other studies have employed 7-day-differentiated PC12 cells (58Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3555-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and were reported to be dependent upon TrkA for survival. In this case, K252a completely abrogated NGF-dependent survival. Clearly there are differences in the requirement for TrkA, depending upon the state of differentiation, the cell type used, and the co-expression of p75. Despite the differences in systems, our findings underscore the requirement of IRAK in promoting NF-κB activation, which is closely tied to cell survival. Moreover, because p62 can bind TrkA (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it is possible that TrkA competes for the p62 scaffold required by the p75 receptor for NF-κB activation thus explaining its ability to diminish the κB response (Figs. 4 and 5). Alternatively, the region of p62 where TrkA binds may play a regulatory role in NF-κB activation, and binding of TrkA prevents p62 from modulating κB signaling. Studies are underway to further examine the role of TrkA in the κB pathway.The atypical PKC isoforms phosphorylate the β subunit of the IKK complex (45Lallena M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby serving as an IKK kinase. NGF-induced activation of NF-κB stimulates the activity of the IKKs (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Transfection of antisense p62 has been shown to selectively block NGF-induced activation of IKKβ (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Herein we demonstrate that p62, the atypical PKC-interacting protein, plays a role in recruitment of IKKβ to the p75 receptor complex. This finding thus explains the ability of antisense p62 to block NGF-induced NF-κB activation. p62 serves not only as a scaffold protein that can bind TRAF6-aPKC as well as IRAK but also serves as a bridge by binding the TrkA receptor leading to the recruitment of p75 through TRAF6 (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, p62 emerges as a critical component of this pathway.The p75 receptor has also been reported to bind RIP2 (59Khursigara G. Bertin J. Yano H. Moffett H. DiStefano P.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 16: 5854-5863Crossref Google Scholar), an adaptor protein with serine/threonine kinase activity (60McCarthy J.V., Ni, J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The p75-RIP2 pathway regulates NGF-induced NF-κB activation in Schwann cells. Thus, two pathways emerge for regulation of NF-κB by the p75 receptor, one controlled by IRAK·TRAF6 in PC12 cells and the other by RIP2 in Schwann cells. The two pathways appear to be separate, because dominant negative RIP2 does not effect TRAF6-mediated activation of κB (59Khursigara G. Bertin J. Yano H. Moffett H. DiStefano P.S. Chao M.V. J.

Each of the kinases associated with these pathways is capable of activating NF-κB and likewise provides a bifunctional switch for cell survival or death. Further studies are warranted to fully understand the role p62 plays as a bridge between p75-TrkA receptors, the molecular mechanism of NF-κB activation via the p62 scaffold, and the influence exerted by p75/TrkA receptors as well as kinases such as IRAK and RIP2 in the context of neurotrophin cell survival and cell death decisions.Note Added in ProofWe have recently determined that k252a blocks NGF internalization in a dose-dependent manner, therefore prolonging p75-mediated signaling at the cell surface. These findings are consistent with survival signaling taking place at the cell surface (61Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 regulates the expression of a wide variety of genes involved in immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, and other cellular processes (1Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to an inhibitory protein of the IκB family. Activation of NF-κB by an external stimulus involves phosphorylation and rapid degradation of IκB proteins by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα are the most well characterized stimuli that lead to the activation of NF-κB. Binding of interleukin-1 (IL-1) to its receptor promotes the association of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) with the receptor (4Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), through the adapter protein MyD88 (5Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.-L., Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). IRAK then gets highly phosphorylated and leaves the receptor complex to interact with TRAF6, a member of the TNF receptor associated factor family (6Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The IRAK·TRAF6 interaction triggers kinase cascades that lead to the activation of NF-κB (6Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M.

IRAK is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that shares 25% sequence identity with human mixed-lineage kinase, 30–33% sequence identity with a protein kinase that is a product of the ptogene of tomato plant, and 32% identity to the kinase domain ofDrosophila pelle, which is involved in the activation of Dorsal, the Drosophila equivalent of NF-κB (4Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). These kinases define a subgroup of cytoplasmic kinases called the serine/threonine innate immunity kinases (SIIK) group (9Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). IRAK is a multidomain protein containing an N-terminal death domain of 120 amino acids, a central 300-amino acid kinase domain, and an undetermined C-terminal domain that is absent in pelle (10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Two other IRAK-related proteins IRAK-2 and IRAK-M (for its higher levels of expression in cells of monocytic lineage), have been found in humans (8Weshe H. Gao X., Li, X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 11Muzio M., Ni, J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Properties of IRAK resemble the serine/threonine kinase RIP, implicated in TNF signaling. TNF-R1 signaling to NF-κB activation is in part reported to be mediated by recruitment of mPLK, which, based upon chromosomal location and sequence identity, is the mouse homologue of the human IRAK (12Vig E.

In addition to IL-1 and TNFα, treatment of neuronal cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes NF-κB activation (13Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Mamidipudi V. Diaz-Meco M.T. Barker P.A. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), by binding to two distinct receptors, TrkA and p75. We demonstrated previously that in the NGF NF-κB activation pathway, the atypical PKC binding protein p62 serves as a scaffold by linking p75-TRAF6 and TrkA receptor components (13Wooten M.W.

Although TrkA has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (14Meakin S.O. Shooter E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), the p75 receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, has no known intrinsic kinase activity (15Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar, 16Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L.

Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Moreover, p75 has been shown to signal independently of TrkA in the NF-κB pathway and enhance the survival response of sensory neurons to NGF (18Hamnoue M. Middleton G. Wyatt S. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Davies A.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, we searched for a p75-associated kinase that mediates NGF-induced NF-κB signaling. We report here, for the first time, an NGF-dependent association of IRAK with p75 in PC12 cells leading to NF-κB activation. We demonstrate that IRAK is a critical component of this pathway. Overexpression of catalytically active IRAK in PC12 cells enhances cell survival, whereas catalytically inactive IRAK blocks activation of NF-κB through a mechanism whereby the association of the p62 scaffold was blocked from its association with the p75 receptor. DISCUSSIONA number of protein kinases have been known to associate with p75 (46Ohmichi M."

Patterns of increased co-expression of stromelysin-1 and ETS-1 genes have been observed in pathological processes. Stromelysin-1 promoter is transactivated by ETS proteins through two palindromic head to head ETS-binding sites, an unusual configuration among metalloproteinase promoters. By using surface plasmon resonance, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and photo-cross-linking, we showed that full-length human ETS-1 (p51) binds cooperatively to the ETS-binding site palindrome of the human stromelysin-1 promoter, with facilitated binding of the second ETS-1 molecule to form an ETS-1·DNA·ETS-1 ternary complex. The study of N-terminal deletion mutants allowed us to conclude that cooperative binding implied autoinhibition counteraction, requiring the 245–330-residue region of the protein that is encoded by exon VII of the gene. This region was deleted in the natural p42 isoform of ETS-1, which was unable to bind cooperatively to the palindrome.

Stromelysin-1 expression is mainly controlled at the transcription level. A number of specific DNA elements in the human stromelysin-1 promoter have been shown to be important in the regulation of its transcription (11Ye S. Whatling C. Watkins H. Henney A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Rekdal C. Sjottem E. Johansen T. J. Biol.

Among them, two palindromic ETS-binding sites (EBS)1 with a 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ core motif at −216 to −209 and at −208 to −201 bind ETS transcription factors. This EBS palindrome is required for basal expression and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate tumor promoter response (13Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is highly conserved through species. The ETS-1 oncoprotein, the founding member of the ETS family, transactivates the rat stromelysin-1 promoter through this palindrome (14Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). These family members are important transcription factors involved in development (15Maroulakou I.G. Bowe D.B.

Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). They have also been implicated in several types of cancer and other human diseases (19Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar). All ETS proteins share a conserved ∼85-amino acid DNA binding domain (ETS domain) organized into a winged helix-turn-helix motif (20Sharrocks A.D. Brown A.L. Ling Y. Yates P.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1371-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Their specificity for target promoters is controlled at several levels. Nevertheless, DNA binding modulation can be viewed as the first transcriptional control. Binding specificity to a given EBS can be partially provided by the flanking sequences surrounding the EBS core. Further specificity occurs through combinatorial interactions of ETS proteins with co-factors at adjacent DNA elements (21Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Additional control is provided by autoinhibition (23Graves B.J. Cowley D.O. Goetz T.L. Petersen J.M. Jonsen M.D. Gillespie M.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, mediated by cis-acting inhibitory modules, negatively regulates DNA binding through intramolecular interactions. ETS-1 represents the best studied example (24Lim F. Kraut N. Frampton J. Graf T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M.

Given that on one hand the same pro-inflammatory factors as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α are able to activate stromelysin-1 and ETS-1 (32Mauviel A. J. Cell.

Stehelin D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5683-5688PubMed Google Scholar), there is a strong presumption that misregulation of stromelysin-1 could be mediated by ETS-1. Previous work (13Buttice G. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7196-7204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) showed that both EBS of the palindrome acted synergistically to transactivate stromelysin-1 gene promoter. Nevertheless, in a heterologous system ETS-1 and ETS-2 showed no cooperative binding to the palindrome (14Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies proved that the functional EBS palindromes present in GATA-1 and p53 promoter (38Seth A. Robinson L. Thompson D.M. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1783-1790PubMed Google Scholar, 39Venanzoni M.C. Robinson L.R. Hodge D.R. Kola I. Seth A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1199-1204PubMed Google Scholar) cooperatively bound ETS-1 and ETS-2. Given the growing importance of the EBS palindrome for the transcriptional regulation of stromelysin-1 by ETS proteins (40Buttice G. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Basuyaux J.P. Carrere S. Kurkinen M.

In this study, by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and photo-cross-linking experiments, we show that the full-length human ETS-1 protein (p51) binds with a positive cooperativity to the EBS palindrome of the human stromelysin-1 promoter. This cooperativity is seen exclusively under a palindromic topology and leads to the formation of a ternary ETS-1·DNA·ETS-1 complex. By using kinetic analysis and N-terminal deletion mutants, we conclude that the observed cooperativity is because of a facilitated binding of the second ETS-1 molecule to form the ternary ETS-1·DNA·ETS-1 complex. Furthermore, this mechanism implies autoinhibition counteracting of ETS-1 through the 245–330-residue region of the protein encoded by the exon VII of the gene. The p42 isoform of ETS-1, lacking only this region, is unable to bind cooperatively to the palindrome, despite a better binding to each EBS. Transient transfection experiments show for p51 a good correlation between DNA binding and promoter transactivation. In contrast, p42 shows a poorer transactivation reinforcing the significance of cooperative binding for a full ETS-1-mediated transactivation of the promoter. To our knowledge, this is the first time that ETS-1 is shown to be able to counteract its own autoinhibition. Mutant forms of the human stromelysin-1 promoter corresponding to M1, M2, M1M2, DR, and IP were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate oligonucleotides (Table I) and the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene®) with a pØGH plasmid (HGH-TGES, Nichols Institute Diagnostics) containing the −1303/+4 fragment of the wild type human stromelysin-1 promoter as a template (13Buttice G.

Fragments were blunted with T4-DNA polymerase and cloned into the SmaI site of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Correct insertion and orientation were confirmed by sequencing. Human full-length ETS-1 and 5′ deletion mutant constructions were obtained by PCR amplification using appropriate primers (Table II) and cloning into a pTyb2 vector (T7 Impact System, New England Biolabs). The human ETS-1 cDNA inserted in a pSG5 vector was used as a template. The 5′ primers were always designed in-frame with the NdeI site. The amplified fragments were submitted to NdeI digestion and cloned into a pTyb2 vector, previously digested by NdeI and SmaI endonucleases. The ETS-1 p42 isoform construct was obtained by PCR site-directed mutagenesis (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Amplified fragments were purified on QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and checked for sequence before immobilization on the Sensor Chip. Proteins were purified using the T7-Impact System (New England Biolabs).Escherichia coli (ER2566) was transformed with the appropriate recombinant plasmid. Fresh overnight cultures were diluted 1:25 in 250 ml of Luria-Bertani medium and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 230 rpm. When culture density reachedA595nm = 0.7, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. The culture was incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 3–4 h. Cultures were harvested, and pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, complete protease inhibitors mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Bacteria were lysed with a French press using a 1000 pounds/square inch pressure. Lysates were clarified by a 5-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C followed by a subsequent 15-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Each clarified lysate was applied to a 5-ml chitin bead column (New England Biolabs). Columns were washed with 20 volumes of column buffer (lysis buffer without protease inhibitors) and rapidly flushed with 3 volumes of elution buffer (column buffer without Triton X-100) containing 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Columns were then stored 16 h at 4 °C for peptidic cleavage. Proteins were eluted by 15 ml of elution buffer in 1-ml fractions. Fractions with proteins were pooled, and for further purification were diluted and chromatographed on a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a Bio-Rad Biologic Chromatography System (Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted by a NaCl gradient (0.05–1m). Fractions containing the protein were quick-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C after dialysis against HBS-EP (0.01 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20). Yields were measured by colorimetry (Bio-Rad protein assay) and corrected by comparison against known protein standards (bovine serum albumin) on SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Blue staining. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the WT, M1, M2, WT + 4, and M1M2 mutants of the stromelysin-1 (−223/−194) promoter region (Table I) were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and were subsequently purified by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Recombinant proteins (4 pmol) were incubated with 0.5 ng of probe in 20 μl of binding reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) for 30 min on ice. Complexes formed were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 29:1, Euromedex) non-denaturing gel in 0.25× TBE buffer at room temperature. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. Recombinant human ETS-1 p51 (4 pmol) was phosphorylated by incubation with 150 units of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII, rat truncated recombinant protein, New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for various times in 20 μl of kination buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.4 μm calmodulin, 100 μm ATP) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2× gel loading buffer (0.1 m Tris, 4% SDS, 1.44 m β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.2% xylene cyanol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) and subsequent boiling for 2 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For gel shift assays, the recombinant proteins (4 pmol) were phosphorylated under the same conditions for 90 min in absence of radioactive ATP. Subsequent binding reactions were performed with 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probe. The volume was adjusted to 30 μl with binding reaction buffer. Cross-linking reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl in phosphate-buffered saline solution (Invitrogen). 4 pmol of ETS-1 were incubated with various amounts of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (0.125 to 2 ng) for 30 min on ice. Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (Aldrich) and ammonium persulfate were added to 150 μm and 2.5 mm, respectively, just before illumination by standard flashlight at a distance of 10 cm. Then the samples were immediately quenched with 20 μl of 2× gel loading buffer and heated to 100 °C for 2 min. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gel were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. SPR measurements were carried out using a BIAcore 2000 apparatus (Biacore®). Double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides (99 bp long) were immobilized on a streptavidin-coupled CM5 Sensor Chip using standard protocol as indicated in the Amine Coupling Kit (Biacore®). HBS-EP BIA certified buffer (0.01 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20, Biacore®) was used as a running buffer. Briefly, flow rate was fixed at 10 μl/min. Streptavidin was injected at 500 ng/μl in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5, for 12 min. Biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides were injected through each flow cell at 200 ng/ml onto the Sensor Chip until a suitable stable RU signal was obtained. The integrity and quantity of fixed DNA was checked by a 120-s injection of 1.6 μm calf histone H1 (Sigma) at 10 μl/min. Equilibrium binding experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Proteins were injected at the desired concentration in HBS-EP for 120 s. The Sensor Chip was regenerated by a 60-s injection of 0.03% SDS. Final curves were obtained by subtraction of the signal corresponding to a flow cell functionalized with M1M2 oligonucleotide. Resonance units (RU) for calculation of the binding ratios were measured at the end of the injection when binding equilibrium was reached. Kinetic experiments were carried out at 15 °C at a flow rate of 30 μl/min on a CM5 Sensor Chip prepared as described above with a 100-RU stable fixation of each biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide. ETS-1 p51 isoform was injected using the KINJECT procedure for 90 s at 7.25, 14.5, 29, and 58 nm concentrations. Dissociation of the complex was then monitored for 300 s before regeneration by a 60-s injection of 0.03% SDS in distilled water. Each injection was repeated three times to obtain a complete data set of 12 curves. Raw data were corrected by subtraction of the blank curve corresponding to M1M2 oligonucleotide. Each data set was globally fitted with Biaeval® 3.1 software. The schematic representation of the models that we edited and used for the data analysis and their related set of differential rate equations are listed in Table III. For each model, the kinetic parameters as well as the maximum binding capacity of the immobilized ligand were considered as global parameters for a given data set. Moreover, two local parameters were added for each curve to take into account the refractive index changes at the beginning of the wash-on and wash-off phase.Table IIISchematic representation of the kinetic models and the related differential equationsM1 model, one-to-one interactionA + B ⇔ AB (ka1; kd1;Kd1)d[B]/dt= −ka1[A][B] + kd1[AB]d[AB]/dt = ka1[A][B] −kd1[AB]WT model A, two independent and non-equivalent binding sites on ligandA + B ⇔ AB (ka1; kd1;Kd1)d[B]/dt = −ka1[A][B] +kd1[AB] −ka2[A][B] + kd2[BA]A + B ⇔ BA (ka2; kd2;Kd2)d[AB]/dt =ka1[A][B] − kd1[AB] −ka2[A][AB] +kd2[A2B]A + AB ⇔ A2B (ka2; kd2;Kd2)d[BA]/dt =ka2[A][B] − kd2[BA] −ka1[A][BA] +kd1[A2B]A + BA ⇔ A2B (ka1; kd1;Kd1)d[A2B]/dt =ka2[A][AB] −kd2[A2B] +ka1[A][BA] −kd1[A2B]WT model B, two independent binding sites on ligand and conformational changeA + B ⇔ AB (ka1; kd1;Kd1)d[B]/dt = −ka1[A][B] + kd1[AB] −ka2[A][B] + kd2[BA]A + B ⇔ BA (ka2; kd2;Kd2)d[AB]/dt =ka1[A][B] − kd1[AB] −ka2[A][AB] +kd2[A2B]A + AB ⇔ A2B (ka2; kd2;Kd2)d[BA]/dt =ka2[A][B] − kd2[BA] −ka1[A][BA] +kd1[A2B]A + BA ⇔ A2B (ka1; kd1;Kd1)d[A2B]/dt =ka2[A][AB] −kd2[A2B] +ka1[A][BA] −kd1[A2B] −ka3[A2B] +kd3[A2B*]A2B ⇔ A2B* (ka3; kd3;Kd3)d[A2B*]/dt =ka3[A2B] −kd3[A2B*]WT model C, sequential bindingA + B ⇔ AB (ka1;kd1; Kd1)d[B]/dt= − ka1[A][B] + kd1[AB]A + AB ⇔ A2B (ka2;kd2;Kd2)d[AB]/dt =ka1[A][B] − kd1[AB] −ka2[A][AB] + kd2[A2B]d[A2B]/dt =ka2[A][AB] −kd2[A2B]WT model D, sequential binding and conformational changed[B]/dt = −ka1[A][B] + kd1[AB]A + B ⇔ AB (ka1; kd1;Kd1)d[AB]/dt =ka1[A][B] − kd1[AB] −ka2[A][AB] +kd2[A2B]A + AB ⇔ A2B (ka2; kd2;Kd2)d[A2B]/dt =ka2[A][AB] −kd2[A2B] −ka3[A2B] +kd3[A2B]A2B ⇔ a2B* (ka3; kd3;Kd3)d[A2B*]/dt =ka3[A2B] −kd3[A2B*] Open table in a new tab HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 12-well plates (2 ml per well) to reach 60–80% confluence at the time of transfection. Efficiency of transfection was tested with a β-galactosidase encoding expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter after coloration of the transfected cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Before transfection, Exgen 500 Transfection Reagent (1.5 μl per well, Euromedex) was incubated with 250 ng of each respective reporter (pGL3) and expression vector (pSG5) for 10 min at room temperature in a volume of 50 μl of a 150 mm NaCl solution. Cell medium was changed for 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and DNA-Exgen 500 mixture was added. After 16 h, medium was changed for 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection with 250 μl of cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mmglycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT). 20-μl aliquots of each supernatant were tested for luciferase activity (luciferase assay kit, Promega) using a Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold). The expression of the proteins of interest (ETS-1 p51 or p42) was tested by Western blot analysis on total cell lysates using a primary antibody directed against the ETS-1 DBD (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To investigate the characteristics of the interaction between ETS-1 and the head to head EBS palindrome located −216/−201 in the stromelysin-1 promoter (referred to as wild type (WT) in the following), several mutants of the EBS repeat were produced. Either one (M1 or M2) or both (M1M2) EBS were inactivated by directed mutagenesis exchanging the 5′-GGAA-3′ core consensus with 5′-AAAA-3′ (Table I). Biotinylated PCR fragments of the −276/−177 region were used as a ligand for SPR measurements of the interaction between ETS-1 and the EBS palindrome (Fig.1A). We observed a positive cooperative binding to the WT site in comparison to M1 or M2 mutants. Indeed, the measured RU signal corresponding to the ETS-1 binding to the WT site was higher than the sum of the RU signal for M1 and M2 mutants (dotted line on Fig. 1A). To determine whether the cooperative binding was dependent on the mutual orientation of the EBS, we produced mutants in which one (direct repeat, referred to as DR) or both (inverted palindrome, referred to as IP) EBS orientations were changed, taking care to preserve their flanking sequence (Table I). SPR measurements showed a complete disappearance of the cooperative binding to the IP and DR sites as binding to these mutants was approximately twice the binding to the M1 site (Fig. 1B). This quantitatively confirms the observation that ETS-1 or ETS-2 tends to bind head to head EBS palindromes, such as those encountered in GATA-1 (38Seth A. Robinson L. Thompson D.M. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1783-1790PubMed Google Scholar) or p53 (39Venanzoni M.C. Robinson L.R. Hodge D.R. Kola I. Seth A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1199-1204PubMed Google Scholar) promoters, better than a single EBS or other topology of EBS repeats (44Hodge D.R. Robinson L. Watson D. Lautenberger J. Zhang X.K. Venanzoni M. Seth A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that ETS-1 could be able to discriminate between different topologies of EBS repetitions tends to prove that this effect could not be driven by structural effects like cooperative bending of the DNA facilitated by the proximity of the EBS. Indeed structural studies showed that ETS DNA binding domain (DBD) binding to DNA induces moderate bending (45Pio F. Kodandapani R., Ni, C.Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. J.

Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). If such a phenomenon was the unique strength of the cooperativity, binding to IP and DR mutant sites would also be enhanced by the DNA bending generated by the first ETS-1 molecule. Then other mechanisms, like protein-protein interactions, should be envisaged. The major drawback of BIAcore® technology is its inability to identify the complexes formed between the ligand and the analyte during the injection time. So we confirmed our observations by visualizing the protein-DNA complexes at the equilibrium by EMSA and photo-cross-linking. EMSA showed the formation of a single major complex between ETS-1 and the WT probe (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Whereas a 200× molar excess of WT no"

Following a comprehensive isolation of CpG islands that were methylated in human lung adenocarcinoma, we found that in cancer cells de novo CpG island methylation generally occurred in a sporadic manner. However, some methylated CpG islands appeared to cluster in discrete chromosomal regions. In this study, we have investigated the methylation status of CpG islands located at such chromosomal loci. We have found that many CpG islands at the HOXA and HOXD loci were methylated in human lung adenocarcinoma. The de novo methylation of these CpG islands was also observed in patient's DNA from noncancerous portions of lung tissue. These results indicate the presence of specific chromosomal regions that are susceptible to de novo methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2330419697,"Angiogenesis is an indispensable prerequisite for the progression and metastasis of solid malignancies. Tumor angiogenesis appears to be governed by alterations of tumor suppressor or oncogenes operant in a broad range of tumors. We have addressed this issue in neuroblastoma, a malignancy characterized by the near-exclusive amplification and overexpression of the N-Myc oncogene. Here, we report that N-Myc overexpression results in down-regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and that IL-6 is an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and VEGF-induced rabbit corneal angiogenesis. STAT3 is instrumental for IL-6 activity as infection with adenoviruses expressing a phosphorylation deficient STAT3 mutant renders endothelial cells insensitive to the antiproliferative action of IL-6. Finally, though IL-6 does not influence neuroblastoma cell growth, IL-6-expressing xenograft tumors in mice exhibit reduced neovascularization and suppressed growth. Our data shed new light on the mechanisms by which N-myc oncogene amplification enhances the malignant phenotype in neuroblastomas."

Genes that are over-expressed in SCLC were identified using 32 pairs of fluorescence-labeled cDNA samples representing various lung tumors and normal tissues. This comprehensive approach has resulted in the identification of 209 genes that are differentially over-expressed in SCLC. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to further validate the expression of 43 genes in SCLC tumors and various normal tissues. Discussed in this report are nine genes, which showed the most promising SCLC tumor to normal tissue differential expression profiles, including seven known and two novel genes. The large number of differentially expressed genes identified from this analysis and the characterization of these genes will provide valuable information in better understanding the biology of SCLC and help us in developing these gene products as potential targets for diagnostic as well as therapeutic usage."
https://openalex.org/W2015316756,"The ability of a helicase to bind single-stranded nucleic acid is critical for nucleic acid unwinding. The helicase from the hepatitis C virus, NS3 protein, binds to the 3′-DNA or the RNA strand during unwinding. As a step to understand the mechanism of unwinding, DNA binding properties of the helicase domain of NS3 (NS3h) were investigated by fluorimetric binding equilibrium titrations. The global analysis of the binding data by a combinatorial approach was done using MATLAB. NS3h interactions with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) are 300–1000-fold tighter relative to duplex DNA. The NS3h protein binds to ssDNA less than 15 nt in length with a stoichiometry of one protein per DNA. The minimal ssDNA binding site of NS3h helicase was determined to be 8 nucleotides with the microscopic<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 2–4 nm or an observed free energy of −50 kJ/mol. These NS3h-DNA interactions are highly sensitive to salt, and the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> increases 4 times when the NaCl concentration is doubled. Multiple HCV helicase proteins bind to ssDNA >15 nucleotides in length, with an apparent occluded site of 8–11 nucleotides. The DNA binding data indicate that the interactions of multiple NS3h protein molecules with long ssDNA are both noncooperative and sequence-independent. We discuss the DNA binding properties of HCV helicase in relation to other superfamily 1 and 2 helicases. These studies provide the basis to investigate the DNA binding interactions with the unwinding substrate and their modulation by the ATPase activity of HCV helicase."

To investigate the molecular domains that participate in assembly and membrane trafficking of HCN channels, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system, patch clamp electrophysiology, and confocal microscopy. We show here that the N termini of the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms interacted and were essential for expression of functional homo- or heteromeric channels on the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells. We also show that the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) of HCN2 was required for the expression of functional homomeric channels. This expression was dependent on a 12-amino acid domain corresponding to the B-helix in the CNBD of the catabolite activator protein. However, co-expression with HCN1 of an HCN2 deletion mutant lacking the CNBD rescued surface immunofluorescence and currents, indicating that a CNBD need not be present in each subunit of a heteromeric HCN channel. Furthermore, neither CNBDs nor other COOH-terminal domains of HCN1 and HCN2 interacted in yeast two-hybrid assays. Thus, interaction between NH2-terminal domains is important for HCN subunit assembly, whereas the CNBD is important for functional expression, but its absence from some subunits will still allow for the assembly of functional channels.

In addition to Ih, cloned HCN channels also produce a time-independent, instantaneous current (Iinst), which is cAMP-sensitive and has a reversal potential similar to that of Ih (6Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 7: 5101-5109Google Scholar). Based on their homology to the tetrameric voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, HCN channels are thought to be composed of four subunits, each having six transmembrane helices with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini.Four mammalian HCN isoforms (HCN1 to HCN4) have been cloned and heterologously expressed. The time-dependent (Ih) currents produced by these channels differ from each other mainly in their sensitivity to cAMP and rates of activation, with time constants for activation following the series HCN1 < HCN2 < HCN3 < HCN4 (2Santoro B.

Native hyperpolarization-activated currents in brain and heart differ from the slowly activating currents produced by heterologously expressed homomeric HCN channels, and different subunit isoforms have overlapping expression patterns (8Santoro B.

Thus, it is thought that native pacemaker currents may be produced by a combination of homo- and heteromeric channels. Indeed, the difference in activation rates betweenIh produced by HCN1 and HCN2 has been used to demonstrate that these subunits can combine to form heteromeric HCN channels; co-expression of the two isoforms or expression of tandem dimers results in Ih with similar activation rates intermediate between those produced by homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels (10Ulens C.

The CNBDs of HCN channels are homologous to those of the related CNG channels and other cyclic nucleotide binding proteins, including the bacterial catabolite-activating protein for which the crystal structure has been solved (13McKay D.B.

This canonical CNBD is composed of three α-helices (A-, B-, and C-helix) and an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel, which lies between the A-helix and the B-helix (14Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have been shown to be important for trafficking of the channels to the cell membrane. We have previously shown that deletion of the CNBD eliminated functional expression of HCN2 in CHO cells (6Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 7: 5101-5109Google Scholar). This is similar to the loss of function observed upon deletion of CNBDs in the human ether-a-go-go-related (HERG) channel (29Aydar E. Palmer C. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the plant KAT1 channel (30Marten I. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3448-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which are similar to HCN channels.In this paper, we have examined the roles of the NH2 and COOH termini of HCN channels in subunit interactions and functional expression by using a combination of whole cell patch clamping, yeast two-hybrid assays, and confocal microscopy. We found that the NH2-terminal domains of HCN1 and HCN2 interacted and were essential for expression of homo- or heteromeric channels on the cell surface. We also found that the putative B-helix of the CNBD was required for expression of homomeric HCN channels. However, no interactions were detected between CNBDs, and it was not necessary to have an intact CNBD in each subunit of a heteromeric HCN1-HCN2 channel for functional expression. These results are consistent with a role for the amino terminus in assembly of HCN channels and a role for the CNBD in trafficking of HCN channels to the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have shown that the NH2 termini of the HCN1 and HCN2 pacemaker channel isoforms interact, both with themselves and with each other, in yeast two-hybrid assays. This interaction appears to be obligatory for expression of homomeric and heteromeric HCN channels, because expression of an HCN2 channel lacking the N terminus was not rescued by HCN1. The lack of functional expression of HCN2-ΔN channels could be explained by a failure of subunits to assemble and form channels, a failure of assembled channels to move to the plasma membrane or an inability of assembled channels on the plasma membrane to conduct current. The latter possibility seems unlikely, because the surface immunofluorescence in cells expressing the HCN2-ΔN mutant was dramatically reduced compared with that in cells expressing the full-length HCN2, suggesting that only a small fraction, if any, of the mutant channels were on the plasma membrane. Co-expression with HCN1 did not change the localization of fluorescence for HCN2-ΔN, consistent with the absence of functional heteromers on the plasma membrane. Based on the data presented here, it seems reasonable to propose that direct interactions between the NH2 termini are important for HCN subunits to assemble and form functional channels.The ∼100-amino acid T1 “tetramerization domain” (21Pfaffinger P.J. DeRubeis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28595-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) adjacent to the first transmembrane segment in the N terminus of Kvchannels is important for subunit assembly. The inability of subunits from different Kv subfamilies to assemble involves differences in this domain (35Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The HCN NH2 termini are not similar in primary sequence to the T1 domains of Kvchannels. However, the four mammalian HCN channel isoforms do have strong sequence conservation in the first 51 amino acids adjacent to the first transmembrane domain (the region is not as well conserved in the sea urchin channel, spHCN). Sequences of the N terminus further from S1 are quite divergent among different HCN isoforms. It will be interesting to determine whether the conserved domain in the N terminus is responsible for the yeast two-hybrid interactions and whether the presence of this domain determines functional expression of the channel. If so, the conserved domain of HCN channels might play the same role in subunit assembly as the T1 domain of Kvchannels, demonstrating a general pattern of organization of functional domains within the superfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels.In the second part of this paper, we have shown that at least one subunit of a functional HCN channel must contain an intact CNBD. This differs from the finding that expression of HCN2 channels inXenopus oocytes was independent of the CNBD (19Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), indicating that the expression of functional channels depends on the cellular system used. Regardless of the expression system, however, it is clear that subunits lacking the complete CNBD can assemble under the right circumstances. Indeed, we found that co-expression of HCN1 rescued expression of HCN2-ΔCNBD. This rescue probably reflects the formation of heteromeric channels as has been suggested previously (10Ulens C. Tytgat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6069-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Chen S. Wang J. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Together, the functional heteromerization of HCN1 with HCN2-ΔCNBD and the lack of interactions between any COOH-terminal domains in yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that assembly and functional expression of HCN channels does not require either a CNBD within each subunit or interaction between CNBDs of different subunits.The mechanism by which the putative B-helix controls expression in CHO cells remains to be determined. One possible explanation is that the deletion may disrupt the tertiary structure of a functional subdomain within the CNBD. For instance, the CNBD in CNG channels is formed by two distinct structural and functional domains: a β-roll, consisting of the eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by the A- and B-helices, which stabilizes the ligand in a state-independent manner, and the C-helix, which stabilizes the ligand in the open state of the channel (36Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 37Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, if the CNBD of HCN channels is organized in the same manner as that of CNG channels, it is possible that functional expression of HCN2 in CHO cells depends on an intact β-roll subdomain. Deletion of the B-helix may prevent expression by disrupting the tertiary structure of the CNBD and perhaps destabilize the binding of cAMP. In support of this notion, a similar dependence on an intact CNBD for functional expression is seen in HERG (38Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and KAT1 (30Marten I. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3448-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) channels.A second explanation for the inability of HCN2 channels lacking the putative B-helix to reach the plasma membrane is that this region may contain a primary sequence motif that promotes surface expression. Maet al. (26Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) have recently described motifs that are responsible for localization of Kir channels to the plasma membrane and showed that this function can be transferred to other potassium channels or to a G-protein-coupled receptor. It will be interesting in further experiments to determine whether the putative B-helix contains such a sequence and whether this can restore function and surface expression of channels that otherwise lack a CNBD. Hyperpolarization-activated “pacemaker” currents (known as Ih, If, orIq and collectively referred to here asIh)1are slowly activating, mixed cationic currents that are important determinants of rhythmic firing in the mammalian heart and brain. The hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that produce Ih have been recently cloned (1Santoro B. Grant S.G. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14815-14820Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 2Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12835-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition to Ih, cloned HCN channels also produce a time-independent, instantaneous current (Iinst), which is cAMP-sensitive and has a reversal potential similar to that of Ih (6Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 7: 5101-5109Google Scholar). Based on their homology to the tetrameric voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, HCN channels are thought to be composed of four subunits, each having six transmembrane helices with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. Four mammalian HCN isoforms (HCN1 to HCN4) have been cloned and heterologously expressed. The time-dependent (Ih) currents produced by these channels differ from each other mainly in their sensitivity to cAMP and rates of activation, with time constants for activation following the series HCN1 < HCN2 < HCN3 < HCN4 (2Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 4Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Native hyperpolarization-activated currents in brain and heart differ from the slowly activating currents produced by heterologously expressed homomeric HCN channels, and different subunit isoforms have overlapping expression patterns (8Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shi W. Wymore R., Yu, H., Wu, J. Wymore R.T. Pan Z. Robinson R.B. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Cohen I.S. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is thought that native pacemaker currents may be produced by a combination of homo- and heteromeric channels. Indeed, the difference in activation rates betweenIh produced by HCN1 and HCN2 has been used to demonstrate that these subunits can combine to form heteromeric HCN channels; co-expression of the two isoforms or expression of tandem dimers results in Ih with similar activation rates intermediate between those produced by homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels (10Ulens C. Tytgat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6069-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Chen S. Wang J. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). HCN channels have a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) in the COOH terminus. Direct binding of cAMP to the CNBD of native pacemaker channels in sino-atrial node myocytes (12DiFrancesco D. Tortora P. Nature. 1991; 351: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and to the CNBDs of the cloned HCN2 (4Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) and HCN4 (5Ishii T.M. Takano M. Xie L.H. Noma A. Ohmori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12835-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) isoforms is thought to shift the voltage dependence of Ih activation to more positive potentials. The CNBDs of HCN channels are homologous to those of the related CNG channels and other cyclic nucleotide binding proteins, including the bacterial catabolite-activating protein for which the crystal structure has been solved (13McKay D.B. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9518-9524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This canonical CNBD is composed of three α-helices (A-, B-, and C-helix) and an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel, which lies between the A-helix and the B-helix (14Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 15Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sequence identity between the CNBDs of HCN or CNG channels and that of CAP is quite low (∼20%), the predicted secondary structures are similar, and a structural model based on CAP has been used as a model for CNBDs of CNG channels (e.g. Refs. 16Kumar V.D. Weber I.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 17Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and HCN channels (e.g.Refs. 18Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In other members of the six-transmembrane domain family of ion channels, the carboxyl and amino terminals are involved in subunit interactions and trafficking to the cell surface. For example, the NH2 termini of Kv channels have been shown to interact (20Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), to form tetramers in isolation from the rest of the channel (21Pfaffinger P.J. DeRubeis D. J. Biol.

Based on the data presented here, it seems reasonable to propose that direct interactions between the NH2 termini are important for HCN subunits to assemble and form functional channels.The ∼100-amino acid T1 “tetramerization domain” (21Pfaffinger P.J.

The inability of subunits from different Kv subfamilies to assemble involves differences in this domain (35Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J.

Together, the functional heteromerization of HCN1 with HCN2-ΔCNBD and the lack of interactions between any COOH-terminal domains in yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that assembly and functional expression of HCN channels does not require either a CNBD within each subunit or interaction between CNBDs of different subunits.The mechanism by which the putative B-helix controls expression in CHO cells remains to be determined. One possible explanation is that the deletion may disrupt the tertiary structure of a functional subdomain within the CNBD. For instance, the CNBD in CNG channels is formed by two distinct structural and functional domains: a β-roll, consisting of the eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by the A- and B-helices, which stabilizes the ligand in a state-independent manner, and the C-helix, which stabilizes the ligand in the open state of the channel (36Goulding E.H.

Thus, if the CNBD of HCN channels is organized in the same manner as that of CNG channels, it is possible that functional expression of HCN2 in CHO cells depends on an intact β-roll subdomain. Deletion of the B-helix may prevent expression by disrupting the tertiary structure of the CNBD and perhaps destabilize the binding of cAMP. In support of this notion, a similar dependence on an intact CNBD for functional expression is seen in HERG (38Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol.

Together, the functional heteromerization of HCN1 with HCN2-ΔCNBD and the lack of interactions between any COOH-terminal domains in yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that assembly and functional expression of HCN channels does not require either a CNBD within each subunit or interaction between CNBDs of different subunits. The mechanism by which the putative B-helix controls expression in CHO cells remains to be determined. One possible explanation is that the deletion may disrupt the tertiary structure of a functional subdomain within the CNBD. For instance, the CNBD in CNG channels is formed by two distinct structural and functional domains: a β-roll, consisting of the eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by the A- and B-helices, which stabilizes the ligand in a state-independent manner, and the C-helix, which stabilizes the ligand in the open state of the channel (36Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 37Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, if the CNBD of HCN channels is organized in the same manner as that of CNG channels, it is possible that functional expression of HCN2 in CHO cells depends on an intact β-roll subdomain. Deletion of the B-helix may prevent expression by disrupting the tertiary structure of the CNBD and perhaps destabilize the binding of cAMP. In support of this notion, a similar dependence on an intact CNBD for functional expression is seen in HERG (38Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and KAT1 (30Marten I. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3448-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) channels. A second explanation for the inability of HCN2 channels lacking the putative B-helix to reach the plasma membrane is that this region may contain a primary sequence motif that promotes surface expression. Maet al. (26Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) have recently described motifs that are responsible for localization of Kir channels to the plasma membrane and showed that this function can be transferred to other potassium channels or to a G-protein-coupled receptor. It will be interesting in further experiments to determine whether the putative B-helix contains such a sequence and whether this can restore function and surface expression of channels that otherwise lack a CNBD.

https://openalex.org/W2063651758,"VHL is part of an SCF related E3-ubiquitin ligase complex with 'gatekeeper' function in renal carcinoma. However, no mutations have been identified in VHL interacting proteins in wild type VHL tumors. We previously reported that the TRC8 gene was interrupted by a t(3;8) translocation in a family with hereditary renal and non-medullary thyroid cancer. TRC8 encodes a multi-membrane spanning protein containing a RING-H2 finger with in vitro ubiquitin ligase activity. We isolated the Drosophila homologue, DTrc8, and studied its function by genetic manipulations and a yeast 2-hybrid screen. Human and Drosophila TRC8 proteins localize to the endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of either DTrc8 or DVhl resulted in an identical ventral midline defect. Direct interaction between DTrc8 and DVhl was confirmed by GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. CSN-5/JAB1 is a component of the COP9 signalosome, recently shown to regulate SCF function. We found that DTrc8 physically interacts with CSN-5 and that human JAB1 localization is dependent on VHL mutant status. Lastly, overexpression of DTrc8 inhibited growth consistent with its presumed role as a tumor suppressor gene. Thus, VHL, TRC8, and JAB1 appear to be linked both physically and functionally and all three may participate in the development of kidney cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2022001968,"Caltractin (centrin) is a member of the calmodulin subfamily of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins that is an essential component of microtubule-organizing centers in many organisms ranging from yeast and algae to humans. The protein contains two homologous EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains linked by a flexible tether; each domain is capable of binding two Ca2+ ions. In an effort to search for domain-specific functional properties of caltractin, the two isolated domains were subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Ca2+ binding affinities and the Ca2+ dependence of biophysical properties of the isolated domains were monitored by UV, CD, and NMR spectroscopy. Comparisons to the corresponding results for the intact protein showed that the two domains function independently of each other in these assays. Titration of a peptide fragment from the yeast Kar1p protein to the isolated domains and intact caltractin shows that the two domains interact in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with the C-terminal domain binding much more strongly than the N-terminal domain. Measurements of the macroscopic Ca2+ binding constants show that only the N-terminal domain has sufficient apparent Ca2+ affinity in vitro (1–10 μm) to be classified as a traditional calcium sensor in signal transduction pathways. However, investigation of the microscopic Ca2+binding events in the C-terminal domain by NMR spectroscopy revealed that the observed macroscopic binding constant likely results from binding to two sites with very different affinities, one in the micromolar range and the other in the millimolar range. Thus, the C-terminal domain appears to also be capable of sensing Ca2+ signals but is activated by the binding of a single ion.

This protein is an essential component of the centrosome, which mediates chromosome segregation during mitosis. In lower organisms, the protein is found in analogous structures, e.g. the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in algae and the spindle pole body in yeast. Mutations and complete deletions of the caltractin gene have shown that the protein is required for proper cell division (1Andersen S.S.L. Molecular Characteristics of the Centrosome, International Review of Cytology. 187. Academic Press, New York1999Google Scholar, 2Marshall W.F. Rosenbaum J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Algal caltractin and the caltractin analog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (cdc31p) have been shown to be required for the normal duplication and separation of the MTOC in their respective cells (3Baum P. Furlong C. Byers B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5512-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 4Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The yeast protein has been shown to be essential for cell viability, and temperature-sensitive mutants cause cell cycle arrest (6Spang A. Courtney I. Fackler U. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Baum P. Yip C. Goetsch L. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5386-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae, caltractin has been shown to be a major component of the nucleus basal body connector and of the distal striated fiber that connects the basal bodies of contractile fibers, thereby playing an essential role in flagellar excision (8Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Harper J.D.I. Chlamydomonas Cell Cycle Mutants, International Review of Cytology. 189. Academic Press, New York1999Google Scholar). Caltractin is a protein of 169 residues, which shares about 50% sequence identity with the well studied EF-hand protein calmodulin (CaM).1 Like CaM, C. reinhardtii caltractin (CRC) is comprised of two globular domains connected by a central linker, and each domain contains a pair of EF-hands that has the potential to bind two Ca2+ ions. However, several characteristics of caltractin are distinct from CaM. For example, there are 40 conserved residues within the EF-hand domains of caltractins that are not shared by calmodulins (10Levy Y.Y. Lai E.Y. Remillard S.P. Heintzelman M.B. Fulton C. Cell. Motil. Cytoskel. 1996; 33: 298-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Unlike CaM, caltractin contains a positively charged N-terminal extension and conserved aromatic residues near both termini. Caltractin is also distinguished from CaM by having two sites with Ca2+affinities outside the normal range for transducing Ca2+signals, and UV and CD spectra that do not change upon the addition of calcium (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that the two domains of caltractin interact with different target proteins. Two caltractin-specific targets, Kar1p and Kic1p, have been identified in yeast; like caltractin, they are essential components of the spindle pole body (12Sullivan D.S. Biggins S. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Rose M.D. Fink G.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 1047-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Mutational studies suggest that the C-terminal domain mediates the Ca2+-dependent interaction of caltractin with these proteins. It is assumed that other protein targets bind to the N-terminal domain of caltractin, although these have yet to be identified. In vitro, the two domains of CaM behave as independent domains connected by a flexible tether (14Persechini A. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12175-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the tether allows the two domains to wrap around and act in concert to tightly bind to a single target (16Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Given the strong likelihood of domain-specific functions for caltractin, we have carried out a series of biophysical characterizations of intact caltractin and its two isolated domains. These data provide insights into biochemical characteristics of caltractin that show the independence of its two domains in vitro. The results are consistent with a model in which caltractin serves as a bridging/assembly factor in microtubule-organizing centers (17Spang A. Courtney I. Grein K. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 863-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). HEPES and Tris buffers, salts, and other chemicals utilized in protein purification were reagent grade. Tris-d11 used in the NMR sample buffer was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Ultra pure potassium chloride used in calcium titration buffer was from Aldrich. Hirudin and bovine thrombin were purchased from Calbiochem. The 19-residue peptide (KKRELIESKWHRLLFHDKK) from Kar1p comprising the essential yeast caltractin-binding region (18Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was synthesized using solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Three constructs of CRC were used in this study; namely, the full-length (CRC, 1–169 amino acids) protein, the N-terminal domain (CRC-N, 1–94), and the C-terminal domain (CRC-C, 95–169). CRC, CRC-N, and CRC-C were each subcloned into a pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) modified to include a thrombin cleavage site for removal of the N-terminal His6 tag and transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli cells (Novagen). Cloning procedures resulted in the addition of two extra amino acids (Gly-Ser) to the N-terminal end of each half-fragment. For each protein preparation, up to 12 colonies from freshly transformed cells were checked by SDS-PAGE for overexpression upon induction of 3 ml of cultures with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The best overexpressors were used to prepare innocula for larger cultures (2–6 liters). Unlabeled protein samples were obtained from cells grown in 2× YT at 37 °C in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. Uniformly 15N-labeled CRC-N or CRC-C was obtained by growing freshly transformed cells in minimal M9 medium with15NH4Cl (1g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source. To prevent loss of selection, overnight cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium twice, before using them to inoculate large cultures. Cultures were grown to an OD600 of 0.6–0.7, induced with IPTG, and grown for 3 more hours before harvesting. Cell cultures reached an OD600 of about 6.5 at the time of harvest. Frozen E. coli cell pellets were resuspended in a 10-fold excess of sonication buffer (w/v) consisting of 25 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at pH 8.0. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant, titrated with 10 mm imidazole, was incubated with preequilibrated Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C on a tilt table. The resin was loaded into filtration columns (Fisher Scientific) and washed with five column volumes of wash buffer (25 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, pH 8.0). His-tagged caltractin or its domains were then eluted with a similar buffer that contained 150 mmimidazole. Fractions containing caltractin, identified using the Bio-Rad protein assay and by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and diluted with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0 to 3× the volume. Calcium chloride was added to 2.5 mm final concentration immediately prior to cleavage of the His6 tag with 0.5 units of bovine thrombin/mg of His-tagged protein. After 1 h, thrombin was inhibited with the addition of 2 units of hirudin/unit of thrombin. The sample was clarified by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and filtered using a 0.2-micron syringe end filtration disk (Millipore) before loading onto a 50-ml FPLC superloop. Caltractin samples were applied to a preequilibrated Mono Q column (AmershamBiosciences) at 2 ml/min flow rate, washed with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 mNaCl (15 column volumes) in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Purified caltractin samples were lyophilized for long term storage. Protein concentrations were determined using A 280measurements (CRC-N and CRC) (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the Bio-Rad dye binding assay (CRC-C). Only plasticware was used in this procedure and in subsequent handling of apoproteins. All plasticware and filtration devices were pretreated with EGTA and rinsed thoroughly with chelexed water. Chelexed water was prepared by passing deionized water twice over a 1 × 50-cm-long chelex-100 column. Buffers were prepared with chelexed water to minimize calcium contamination and stored in sterile plasticware in contact with a dialysis bag filled with 10 ml of chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad) at the bottom of the 1 liter container (19Linse S. Brodin P. Drakenberg T. Thulin E. Sellers P. Elmden K. Grundstrom T. Forsen S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6723-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Apoproteins were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein in 5 molar excess of EGTA in chelexed water, relative to protein, followed by dialysis against 25 mmTris-d11 or 50 mm HEPES buffer, 75 mm KCl, pH 7.5, as needed. Samples and buffer from the last dialysis step were sterile-filtered (0.2 micron) and stored at 4 °C for up to 10 months until ready to use. For Ca2+ titrations monitored using NMR spectroscopy, apoCRC-C was prepared by treating with chelex-100 and exchanged into Tris-d11 buffer by gel filtration with Sephadex G-25 spinning column chromatography. Aliquots of an appropriate dilution of a 0.1 m calcium standard (Orion, Boston, MA) were added to known concentrations (∼50 μm) decalcified protein samples in 50 mm HEPES buffer and 75 mm KCl at pH 7.5. CRC and CRC-N concentration were determined using absorbance at 280 nm arising from the single tyrosine residue near the N terminus. The tendency for degradation near the N terminus region of the protein (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) results in loss of the tyrosine residue and contributes to a higher than desirable uncertainty in the determination of protein concentration. CRC-C has no tyrosine or tryptophan residues, and its concentration was determined using a dye binding method. Titrations were monitored by measuring the concentration of free calcium in solution using a calcium-sensitive electrode (Model 93-20, Orion, Boston, MA) or by following NMR chemical shift changes. For the calcium-sensitive electrode measurements, 4 ml of a 100 μm solution of protein was used per titration. Electrochemical data were analyzed by non-linear curve fitting using the equation and methods described by Weber et al. (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for binding of calcium ions to the two calcium binding sites within a given domain. In brief, the data was fitted to Equation 1. Fraction Bound={n1Ka1[Ca2+]free/(1+Ka1[Ca2+]free)}+{n2Ka2[Ca2+]free/(1+Ka2[Ca2+]free)}+n3[Ca2+]freeEquation 1 When the binding sites are equivalent, this reduces to Equation2, Fraction bound={n1Ka1[Ca2+]free/(1+Ka[Ca2+]free)}+n3[Ca2+]freeEquation 2 where Ka1 , n1,Ka2 , and n2 reflect the association constants and number of bound calcium ions per mole of protein. The term in n3 is included to account for nonspecific binding, which can become significant upon saturation of the binding sites, especially at high calcium concentrations. When the fit to the second equation was as good as the first, the simpler model was selected. Uncertainties in the protein concentration led to non-ideal stoichiometries of binding derived from curve fitting titration data. The NMR experiments were conducted by measuring the chemical shift changes in one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra. Ca2+binding parameters from NMR data were derived using the computer program Crvfit (R. Boyko and B. D. Sykes, University of Alberta) as described elsewhere (20Li M.X. Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8330-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Binding of the 19-residue Kar1p peptide to CRC, CRC-N, and CRC-C was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy using a Spex Fluorolog fluorimeter (Spex Industries, Inc., Edison, NJ). The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm to minimize possible interference from the tyrosine residue in CRC and CRC-N. Excitation and emission slit widths were 1.5 mm. Sample buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 8.0. Peptide concentration was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 5700 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm. Aliquots of a 300 μm protein sample were added to a 3 μm (initial concentration) Kar1p peptide solution, and the corresponding single scan emission spectrum was recorded over the range 300–450 nm. Spectra were corrected for background fluorescence by subtracting the buffer spectrum. About 20 data points were collected per titration over a protein-to-peptide molar ratio of 0–50. Bruker AMX 500 MHz, AMX 600 MHz, Avance 600, and DRX 750 MHz spectrometers were used to collect NMR data. The two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra were acquired in the apo state, calcium-loaded state (10-fold molar excess of calcium), or the calcium-loaded state in the presence of Kar1p peptide (1.2-fold molar excess). The solutions contained 1 mm protein in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-d11 and 100 mm KCl at pH 7.55 and 30 °C. 15N,1H HSQC spectra were recorded with spectral widths of 13.3 ppm (apo) or 16 ppm (Ca2+) in the proton dimension and 32 ppm in the nitrogen dimension. 16–48 scans were acquired over 1024–2048 × 128–512 complex points. The data were processed using Felix (version 95.0 or 97.0, MSI, San Diego, CA) with zero-filling to 512 points in ω2 and a 90° shifted sine bell window function applied over the 256 real points in each dimension. In all spectra, the 1H dimension was referenced to water at 4.74 ppm, and the center of the15N dimension was indirectly referenced to 118.36 ppm. Titration of Ca2+ into unlabeled apoCRC-C was monitored by one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. Sample conditions were: 0.5 mm protein in 50 mm HEPES, 75 mm KCl, pH 7.51, and 303 K. These conditions were chosen to match those of calcium-sensitive electrode measurements reported here and in previous studies (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so as to allow direct comparison of these results. FIDs were processed using Felix 98 (MSI, San Diego, CA). To pursue the question of the functional independence of the two domains of caltractin, we subcloned the N- and C-terminal fragments and characterized their biophysical properties. Both the 96 amino acid N-terminal fragment (CRC-N) and 77 amino acid C-terminal fragment (CRC-C) contain a pair of calcium-binding EF-hand motifs that constitute an independent folding unit. New expression vectors were constructed because expression of the two fragments was at levels of weak to none in the system used for the intact protein (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genes for the two domains were subcloned into a vector that produces protein with a His6 tag in a 20-residue extension fused to the N terminus of the protein. The tag enables rapid purification by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. This system produces milligrams of protein per liter of culture, a prerequisite for high resolution structure determination, which is one of the primary objectives of our research program. To validate the strategy of studying the two CRC domains independently of each other, UV, CD, and NMR spectroscopy were used to probe the structural features of the two domains as independent modules and in the intact protein. This involved comparing summed spectra of the two domains to the corresponding spectrum of the intact protein obtained under identical conditions in both the absence and presence of Ca2+. The results obtained by monitoring each of these spectroscopic probes were consistent with each other; when the spectra of the domains are added together, they correspond closely to the spectrum of intact CRC. The NMR spectra are most powerful in this context because there are such a large number of discrete signals that can be monitored, so these data will be discussed in more detail. Two-dimensional 15N,1H HSQC spectra were collected from 15N-enriched samples in the apo- and Ca2+-loaded states for CRC-N (Fig.1, A and B), CRC-C (Fig. 1, D and E) and intact CRC (Fig. 1,G and H), which shows a single peak for each NH group in each protein. The most obvious difference in these spectra is the poorer quality of the data for the intact protein, as evidenced by the significantly broader signals. This arises from a combination of the substantially larger molecular weight of the intact protein relative to the fragments, as well as a greater tendency to self-associate and precipitate, particularly in the presence of Ca2+. NMR spectra of the apo proteins (panels A, D, andG) consist of cross peaks within a narrow range of chemical shifts (7.5–9.0 ppm). Interestingly, although CRC-N is larger than CRC-C by 19 residues, apoCRC-N exhibits narrower line widths and greater spectral dispersion. The lower dispersion for CRC-C is independent of protein concentration; apoCRC-C at 1 mmgives a spectrum nearly identical to that at 0.2 mm (data not shown). Thus, the poorer spectral features of CRC-C are presumably not the result of protein aggregation, and it is likely that apoCRC-N is more structured than apoCRC-C. HSQC spectra of the Ca2+-saturated proteins (panels B, E, and H) are significantly different from the corresponding apoproteins. In general, the dispersion of cross peaks for the calcium-loaded proteins is greater than for the apoproteins, indicating a significant change in the chemical environment and possibly an increase in the amount of ordered structure in the Ca2+-bound state. The appearance of low field-shifted 1H resonances at >10 ppm is characteristic of Ca2+-loading of EF-hand proteins (21Drakenberg T. Hofmann T. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5946-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These signals arise from a highly conserved glycine in position 6 of the calcium binding loop that is part of the extensive hydrogen-bonding network formed upon Ca2+ binding (22Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two such signals are clearly observed in the spectrum of CRC-N (Fig.2). Only one Gly resonance with a chemical shift >10 ppm was observed for CRC-C, and this resonance at 10.8 ppm is assigned to Gly-116 in Ca2+ site III. The peak at 10.0 ppm is presumed to arise from the corresponding residue in position 6 of site IV in which the glycine is substituted by an asparagine (Asn-152). It is noteworthy that the spectrum of CRC corresponds closely to the sum of those of CRC-N and CRC-C, with the very few differences readily explained by the additional N and C termini resulting from separation of the two domains. Fig. 2 shows an expansion of the low field region from the 15N-1H HSQC spectra acquired for the Ca2+-loaded states, which contains signals from residues in and adjacent to the Ca2+ binding loops that are extremely sensitive to conformation of the protein. The near identity of the chemical shifts in the two panels of this figure indicates that the structures of the fragments are the same as when the two domains are fused to each other. Our total observations provide strong evidence in support of the structural independence of the two domains in the intact protein. One of the primary motivating factors for studying the two domains of CRC in isolation is to better understand the Ca2+ binding properties of the protein. The Ca2+ binding curve observed for the intact protein by the method of calcium-sensitive electrode was very complex (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of four Ca2+ ions was observed, and macroscopic binding constants were determined assuming a model of two equivalent higher affinity sites (KA = 8.3 × 105m−1) and two equivalent lower affinity sites (KA = 6.2 × 103m−1). The data could also be fit to more complex models, but there was not sufficient evidence to distinguish among various models, so the simplest was chosen to represent the data. Based on similarity to the consensus EF-hand loop Ca2+binding loop sequence, the pair of higher affinity Ca2+sites was assigned to CRC-N. The pair of lower affinity sites was assigned to CRC-C on the basis of the substitutions relative to the consensus sequence in the Ca2+ binding loops in both site III and site IV (Fig. 3). In an attempt to better understand the Ca2+ binding properties of CRC, the Ca2+ binding affinity of each domain was determined using the calcium-sensitive electrode method. The analysis of intact CRC was repeated as a control, and the results corresponded very closely to that reported previously. Experiments on the isolated domains revealed that both CRC-N and CRC-C bind two calcium ions (Fig. 4). Using a model in which the calcium binding affinities of both sites of each domain are equivalent, the calculated calcium affinities (KA ) for CRC-N and CRC-C are 3.4 ± 0.2 × 105m−1 and 2.2 ± 0.2 × 104m−1, respectively (Table I). Attempts at fitting the data to a model with two different calcium binding affinities for the two sites did not provide a significant improvement, so the simplest model was selected. Note that these calcium binding affinities correspond reasonably well to those measured previously by the same method for the full-length protein (11Weber C. Lee V.D. Chazin W.J. Huang B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15795-15802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these results confirmed our previous proposal that the N-terminal domain contains the higher affinity Ca2+ binding sites and the C-terminal domain the lower affinity sites. The low macroscopic binding affinity determined in this way for CRC-C implies that the C-terminal domain does not sense Ca2+ signals in a physiological environment.Table ICa2+ binding to recombinant Chlamydomonas caltractin and its fragments in 50 mm HEPES, 75 mm KCl at pH 7.5, 295 KProteinMethod1-aCalcium binding affinities were derived from: A, Ca2− sensitive electrode; B, NMR data-fitting function for a single type of binding site (N) with a corresponding binding affinity, KA; or C, NMR data-fitting function with two explicit binding sites (with high uncertainty in the value ofKA 2 due to the lack of an experimentally determined zero point).K A11-bValues determined by Method A were averages of three independent measurements.N1K A21-bValues determined by Method A were averages of three independent measurements.N2m−1m−1CRC1-cTaken from Weber et al.

These authors also showed that binding of a Kar1p peptide to yeast caltractin in vitro is calcium-dependent. Studies of the interaction of CRC and its isolated domains with the Kar1p peptide were carried out to determine whether the C. reinhardtii protein could be substituted for the yeast protein and if so, to examine if the two domains bound the peptide with different affinities, as would be predicted on the basis of the results from the analysis of the yeast protein (18Geier B.M. Wiech H. Schiebel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28366-28374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interactions of CRC, CRC-C, and CRC-N with the Kar1p peptide were monitored by 15N,1H NMR using15N-enriched protein and a large excess of peptide (Fig. 1,C, F, and I). Comparisons of the spectra for the Ca2+-loaded states with and without peptide (panels B/C, E/F, H/I) reveal that signals are affected in both domains, and therefore that the peptide interacts at least weakly with both domains. There is a very noticeable change in the apparent quality of the spectrum for intact CRC upon addition of the peptide. This arises from a significant reduction in the resonance line"

Many ABC transport proteins, such as the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein that belongs to ABC subfamily “B” (ABCB1), have a four-domain structure with two hydrophobic membrane spanning domains (MSDs), each of which is followed by a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Most evidence indicates that each MSD contains six transmembrane (TM) segments, and both the NH2 and COOH termini of the protein reside on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In contrast, MRP1 and several other members of subfamily C contain a third NH2-proximal MSD (MSD1) of ∼200 amino acids with five TM segments and an extracytosolic NH2 terminus (5Bakos E. Hegedus T.

Recently, a screen of potential MRP1 inhibitors has identified a series of tricyclic isoxazoles as novel compounds that specifically and potently modulate MRP1-mediated drug resistance in vivo and LTC4 transport in vitro (31Norman B.H Gruber J.M. Hollinshead S.P. Wilson J.W. Starling J.J. Law K.L. Self T.D. Tabas L.B. Williams D.C. Paul D.C. Wagner M.M. Dantzig A.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

In the present study, we have investigated the photolabeling properties of LY475776, an intrinsically photoactivable iodinated azidotricyclic isoxazole analog. We show that inhibition of LTC4 transport and photolabeling of MRP1 by [125I]LY475776 are dependent on GSH, although photolabeling is also supported by certain non-reducing GSH derivatives. Mapping of tryptic fragments of [125I]LY475776-labeled membrane proteins revealed that this compound bound exclusively to the COOH-proximal half of MRP1 with a major labeling site in a region containing the last two TM segments (TM16 and TM17) in MSD3. Reduced labeling of mutant MRP1 proteins with substitutions of Trp1246 in TM17 confirmed the importance of this region for LY475776 binding. Finally, GSH-dependent [125I]LY475776 labeling of MRP1 was significantly reduced after vanadate-induced trapping of ADP, suggesting that hydrolysis of ATP causes a conformational change in MSD3 that reduces the affinity of MRP1 for this reversing agent. [3H]LTC4 (182.8 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. GSH,S-methyl-GSH, S-ethyl-GSH,S-propyl-GSH, S-hexyl-GSH,S-decyl-GSH, ATP, AMP-PNP, ATPγS, sodium orthovanadate,N-ethylmaleimide, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, vincristine, verapamil, quercetin, apigenin, and naringenin were purchased from Sigma. Ophthalmic acid (γGlu-αAbu-Gly), homo-GSH (γGlu-Cys-βAla), Gly-Cys-Gly, and γGlu-Gly-Gly were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin was from ICN Biomedicals (St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada). Intrinsically photoactivable [125I]LY475776 (N-(4-azido-3-[125I]phenyl)-2-[3-(9chloro-3-methyl-4-oxo-4H-isoxazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-5-yl)-cyclohexyl]acetamide) (295.2 μCi/ml) was synthesized and purified by Lilly (Fig.1). Solutions for ATP, ATPγS, GSH, and GSH analogs and derivatives were prepared in buffer (50 mmTris·HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) and then neutralized with 2 m Tris buffer as required. Sodium orthovanadate (10 mm) was also prepared in Tris sucrose buffer and the pH adjusted to 7.5. The solution was then boiled for ∼10 min until its yellow color disappeared and was stored at 4 °C until use. The six MRP1-specific murine mAbs used in this study have been described previously (32Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C.

Proteins were immediately solubilized in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5 or 15% acrylamide gels or 3–12% gradient gels. Gels were dried and exposed to film, and autoradiograms were developed after overnight exposure at −70 °C. Alternatively, proteins were transferred to a nylon membrane by electroblotting and then the membrane was exposed to film overnight at −70 °C. Relative levels of photolabeling were determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms with a ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech) and ChemiImager 4000 software. In some labeling experiments, GSH analogs or derivatives were added instead of GSH at a concentration of 1 mm. To investigate the effect of various mAbs on photolabeling, purified mAbs QCRL-1, -2, -3, -4 were added to the photolabeling mixture at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at room temperature prior to addition of GSH and [125I]LY475776 and UV irradiation. In other experiments, drugs and bioflavonoids were added 30 min prior to cross-linking at the concentrations indicated in the text and figure legends. To assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate-induced trapping of ADP, membrane proteins were incubated with [125I]LY475776 (300 nCi), 1 mm GSH, 5 mm MgCl2, and various concentrations of orthovanadate in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm ATP for 15 min at 37 °C prior to UV cross-linking. Experiments were also carried out in which the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS (0.5 and 2.0 mm) or the covalent modifiers NEM (2 mm) and NBD-Cl (200 μm) were incubated with membranes for 30 min at 37 °C prior to labeling with [125I]LY475776 in the presence of GSH. Crude membranes (150 μg of protein for H69AR cell membranes and 900 μg of protein for SF-MRP1 HeLa cell membranes) or [125I]LY475776-labeled H69AR cell membranes (150 μg of protein) were mixed with diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin at trypsin-to-protein ratios ranging from 1:800 to 10:1 in phosphate-buffered saline in a final volume of 60 μl. After incubating the mixtures at 37 °C for 30 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin as described (6Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M.

After 15 min at room temperature, samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE as well as immunoblotting with enhanced chemiluminescence detection as described (6Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, mAbs QCRL-1, MRPm5 and MRPm6 were used at dilutions of 1:10,000, 1:100, and 1:2,000, respectively. Electrophoresis was performed using SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (7.3 × 10.2 cm) in a Bio-Rad Mini Protein II electrophoresis cell or 16 × 18-cm gels in a vertical slab gel electrophoresis unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Protein concentrations in membrane preparations were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. The effect of LY475776 on MRP1-mediated uptake of [3H]LTC4 into inside-out membrane vesicles was measured in the absence and presence of 1 mm GSH. In the absence of GSH, LY475776 had no detectable effect on LTC4 uptake up to the highest concentration tested (0.8 μm) (Fig. 2). However, in the presence of GSH, LY475776 caused a potent, concentration-dependent inhibition of LTC4transport. Based on results from three independent experiments, the EC50 value for LY475776 was determined to be 0.049 ± 0.010 μm. Thus LY475776 is an extremely potent inhibitor of MRP1-mediated LTC4 uptake but only in the presence of reduced GSH. To investigate further the role of GSH in the interaction of LY475776 with MRP1, the molecule was radioiodinated and determined to photolabel specifically the MRP1 in H69AR membranes but only in the presence of reduced GSH (Fig.3). S-Alkyl derivatives of GSH also stimulated labeling of MRP1 by [125I]LY475776, but their ability to do so diminished when the length of theS-alkyl substituent exceeded three carbon atoms. Thus,S-methyl-GSH, S-ethyl-GSH, andS-propyl-GSH supported [125I]LY475776 labeling but S-hexyl-GSH and S-decyl-GSH did not. The GSH analog, ophthalmic acid, in which the Cys side chain contains a methyl group instead of a sulfhydryl group, stimulated [125I]LY475776 labeling of MRP1 as well as GSH. Similarly, when the glycine residue of GSH was replaced by β-alanine (γGlu-Cys-βAla; homo-GSH), a moderate degree of labeling was observed. On the other hand, [125I]LY475776 labeling in the presence of analogs in which the γ-glutamate or the cysteine residue of GSH had been replaced with glycine (Gly-Cys-Gly or γGlu-Gly-Gly) was very low and comparable with photolabeling in the absence of GSH.

In addition, we have shown that one of these mAbs, QCRL-3, which detects an epitope contained within NBD1 of MRP1, can inhibit photolabeling of the protein by [3H]LTC4. In contrast, mAb QCRL-2, which also maps to NBD1, and mAb QCRL-4, which maps to NBD2, do not (15Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

To determine the effect of these antibodies on binding of LY475776 to MRP1, H69AR membranes were preincubated with mAbs QCRL-2, -3, and -4 (100 μg/ml) followed by photolabeling with [125I]LY475776 in the presence of 1 mm GSH. As a negative control, membranes were preincubated with mAb QCRL-1 which detects a linear epitope in the cytoplasmic region of MRP1 that links NBD1 to MSD3 and does not inhibit transport activity (34Hipfner D.R.

To determine whether compounds that stimulate MRP1-mediated GSH binding and transport also affect GSH-dependent interaction of [125I]LY475776 with MRP1, photolabeling was carried out with membrane proteins that had been preincubated for 30 min with verapamil (100 μm), vincristine (60 μm), quercetin (50 μm), naringenin (50 μm), or apigenin (50 μm). As shown in Fig. 4 B, verapamil inhibited labeling of MRP1 by ∼80%, whereas vincristine inhibited labeling by 60%.

https://openalex.org/W2314623912,"During the initial stage of Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia in mice, interaction of the viral protein gp55 with the erythropoietin receptor, and other host factors, drives the expansion of erythroid precursor cells. Recently, we demonstrated that the Friend virus susceptibility locus, Fv2, which is required for the expansion of infected cells, encodes a naturally occurring, N-terminally truncated form of the Stk receptor tyrosine kinase (Sf-Stk). Here we show that in vitro expression of Sf-Stk confers Friend virus sensitivity to erythroid progenitor cells from Fv2(rr) mice. Furthermore, our data reveal that Sf-Stk kinase activity and Y436, but not Y429, are required for Epo-independent colony formation following Friend virus infection. Introduction of a mutation that results in failure to bind Grb2 abrogates the ability of Sf-Stk to induce colonies in response to Friend virus, while the Grb2 binding site from EGFR restores this response. Consistent with the ability of Grb2 to recruit SOS and Gab1, the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways are activated by Sf-Stk, and both of these pathways are required for gp55-mediated erythroblast proliferation. These data clearly demonstrate a requirement for signaling through Sf-Stk in the Epo-independent expansion of Friend virus-infected cells, and suggest a pivotal role for Grb2 in this response."
https://openalex.org/W1964455153,"During exocytosis, vesicles in secretory cells fuse with the cellular membrane and release their contents in a Ca2+-dependent process. Release occurs initially through a fusion pore, and its rate is limited by the dissociation of the matrix-associated contents. To determine whether this dissociation is promoted by osmotic forces, we have examined the effects of elevated osmotic pressure on release and extrusion from vesicles at mast and chromaffin cells. The identity of the molecules released and the time course of extrusion were measured with fast scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon fiber microelectrodes. In external solutions of high osmolarity, release events following entry of divalent ions (Ba2+ or Ca2+) were less frequent. However, the vesicles appeared to be fused to the membrane without extruding their contents, since the maximal observed concentrations of events were less than 7% of those evoked in isotonic media. Such an isolated, intermediate fusion state, which we term “kiss-and-hold,” was confirmed by immunohistochemistry at chromaffin cells. Transient exposure of cells in the kiss and hold state to isotonic solutions evoked massive release.

Storage in dense core vesicles requires stable packaging for an extended period of time. This is accomplished by association of the vesicular contents. On the other hand, release requires dissociation of this storage matrix on a relatively fast time scale so the contents can be extruded (1Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C.

Aborg C.H. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1984; 120: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These vesicles contain 150 mmhistamine, which alone with its associated anion would lead to a free osmolality of ∼550 mosm (4Fernandez J.M. Villalon M. Verdugo P. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the vesicles are iso-osmotic with the 300-mosm cytoplasm because of the association of the molecules within the granule matrix (5Brodwick M.S. Curran M. Edwards C. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, a single chromaffin cell vesicle contains 550 mmcatecholamine along with 122 mm ATP, 17–30 mmCa2+, 5 mm Mg2+, 22 mmascorbate, and the acidic protein chromogranin A, leading to a total soluble concentration of 750 mm (6Holz R.W.

These close associations have been documented by nuclear magnetic resonance in vesicles from both cell types (9Rabenstein D.L. Ludowyke R. Lagunoff D.

Capacitance and amperometry techniques have indicated that a portion of the vesicular contents can be released through this fusion pore (13Breckenridge L.J. Almers W.

Furthermore, at both mast and chromaffin cells, patch-amperometry measurements reveal that the fusion pore can exist for several milliseconds prior to full extrusion of vesicle contents (15Alvarez d.T.

Brodwick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which has been attributed to the displacement of associated cations in the granule with hydrated cations such as Na+ from the external solution (18Amatore C. Bouret Y. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This ion exchange mechanism, with its associated hydration effects (19Verdugo P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: S33-S37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been hypothesized and experimentally supported at several cell types as reviewed by Artalejoet al. (20Artalejo C.R. Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R62-R65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Theoretical considerations of this process have likened the extrusion and swelling to a controlled explosion that drives full release of the vesicular contents and dissociation of the vesicular matrix (18Amatore C. Bouret Y. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Amperometric recordings revealed that the time course of release is longer than that expected for free diffusion (1Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), having a duration of several milliseconds at chromaffin cells (21Walker A. Glavinovic M.I. Trifaro J.M.

Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1160-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), consistent with a rate-limiting dissociation. The time course of extrusion can be decreased by perturbing any of the physical and chemical gradients that exist between the vesicle interior and the extracellular environment. These include osmolarity, pH, and cation concentration (24Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Jankowski J.A.

J. 1996; 71: 1633-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, increasing the osmotic gradient by lowering the extracellular solution osmolarity decreases the release time course and increases the amount released, whereas high extracellular osmolarity has the opposite effect (27Borges R. Travis E.R. Hochstetler S.E. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8325-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present work, the effects of high osmolarity (using elevated NaCl) on secretory cells were evaluated in an attempt to freeze exocytotic events at the step between fusion pore formation and extrusion of vesicle contents. The results reported are consistent with such a state and reveal that extrusion of the vesicular contents is a distinct step in the sequence of events termed exocytosis.DISCUSSIONIn high osmolarity solutions, secretion from both mast and chromaffin cells is dramatically altered. The results presented here show that vesicle-cell membrane fusion can still occur under these conditions, but that full extrusion of the vesicle contents does not occur. Indeed, the fused vesicles in hypertonic solution appear to be frozen at the cell surface, and only release after swelling of the vesicle matrix is allowed to occur. Previous studies have demonstrated that both chromaffin and mast cell vesicles contract in response to hypertonic stress without disruption of their stored contents (5Brodwick M.S. Curran M. Edwards C. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, the chromaffin vesicle has been termed an ideal osmometer between 300 and 1000 mosm (6Holz R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 175-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The new finding of this work is that high osmolarity solutions prevent full extrusion of vesicle contents and allow temporal isolation of an intermediate state in the sequence of events that occur during exocytosis, a state we refer to as “kiss-and-hold.”Hypertonic solutions clearly lower the rate of exocytosis at both mast and chromaffin cells. This could arise from an increase in actin filaments at the cell membrane as found in neutrophils in hyperosmotic solutions (42Rizoli S.B. Rotstein O.D. Parodo J. Phillips M.J. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C619-C633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because the rate of exocytosis in chromaffin cells depends on the degree of association of actin filaments (43Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaro J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, previous visual studies in high osmolarity solutions have shown that vesicle-cell membrane fusion is not prevented at chromaffin or mast cells (17Zimmerberg J. Curran M. Cohen F.S. Brodwick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 44Breckenridge L.J. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), nor in sea urchin eggs (46Whitaker M. Zimmerberg J. J. Physiol. 1987; 389: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this work, vesicle-cell membrane fusion is established in chromaffin cells by the presence of DβH on the cell surface in both isotonic and hypertonic medium. DβH labeling is lowered in hypertonic solutions, correlating well with the decreased frequency of electrochemically detected spikes. At mast cells, visual evidence for vesicle-cell membrane fusion was not obtained in hypertonic medium, although secretion was clearly evident by the cyclic voltammetry. The secretory events that are seen are so small that they resemble the feet that precede some exocytotic events in iso-osmolar solutions at both types of cells in hypertonic media. This is the expected outcome if vesicle fusion occurred in hypertonic solutions with only minor extrusion of the contents. Despite their small size, the cyclic voltammograms establish that the substances detected are those stored in the vesicles.All of the evidence from both cell types indicates that the small size of the spikes obtained in hypertonic medium is a consequence of inhibition of vesicle-matrix dissociation. The association of the vesicle contents in chromaffin cells has been characterized as a “dynamic viscous solution that is stabilized by ternary complex formation” (10Daniels A.J. Williams R.J. Wright P.E. Neuroscience. 1978; 3: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is also well documented in mast cells (47Uvnas B. J. Physiol Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). Upon exposure to the extracellular solution through the fusion pore, at the initial “kiss,” exchange between the vesicular interior and the extracellular fluid begins. Normally the matrix dissociation and extrusion of its contents relies on hydration, with its accompanying matrix swelling, that is driven by a physical or chemical gradient across the fusion pore. By removing the osmotic gradient in hypertonic solutions, one of the driving forces for dissociation and extrusion is dissipated. The small amount of secretion that does occur could arise from components originally in an unassociated state or a small amount of matrix dissociation that occurs at the fusion pore, but which is unable to propagate into the remainder of the vesicle. Because rates of endocytosis are lowered in hypertonic solutions, the fused, intact vesicle “holds” at the cell surface for an extended period of time.The frozen, fused vesicle state established in hypertonic medium is destroyed once the osmotic gradient is re-established. This occurs with the transient isotonic exposure that evokes multiple spikes on the time scale of cellular swelling. In mast cells, the maximal concentration of these spikes is consistent with extrusion of contents from previously fused vesicles. At chromaffin cells, the maximal concentration and time course of some observed spikes are larger than under normal exocytotic conditions, consistent with multiple, simultaneous secretory events. For cells stimulated with K+, the original stimulus is no longer present upon isotonic solution exposure, and yet secretion is still observed. This strongly suggests that the observed spikes arise from previously fused vesicles. With Ba2+ at chromaffin cells and with mast cells, the isotonic-evoked spikes are unaccompanied by an increase in intracellular divalent ions. Thus, it is clear that the discrete processes of vesicle fusion and vesicle extrusion have been temporally separated. Concentration and pH gradients between the vesicle matrix and the external solution may exert similar effects (24Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,25Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Ciolkowski E.L. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14694-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, chromaffin cells previously stimulated with Ba2+ in hypertonic solutions did not release when exposed to isotonic buffer at pH 5.5 (data not shown). Thus, re-establishing an osmotic gradient is not sufficient to unravel the kiss and hold state; the pH gradient is necessary as well.All of these results are consistent with recent mathematical models for the swelling of secretory granules after fusion pore formation and its role in extrusion of granule contents (18Amatore C. Bouret Y. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 48Chizmadzhev Y.A. Kuzmin P.I. Kumenko D.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2241-2256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These models indicate that the hydration and swelling of the vesicle matrix cause an enlargement of the fusion pore leading to its destabilization. Thus, normally in mast and chromaffin cells the pore expansion of the vesicle occurs rapidly, driven by the irreversible swelling of the matrix, and results in full incorporation of the vesicle membrane and extrusion of vesicular contents as illustrated in the sequence of steps in Fig.6. By removing the driving force for swelling, we were able to isolate the intermediate kiss-and-hold state. The mathematical models predict that “kiss-and-run” events, events where fusion pore formation allows escape of some transmitter followed by vesicular retreat from the cellular membrane without fully fusing, are unlikely under normal conditions at cells with large vesicles. Consistent with these models, all fusion pore events in mast cells are followed by complete fusion of the vesicle with the cellular membrane and subsequent release (15Alvarez d.T. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Patch-amperometry studies on chromaffin cells reveal only 10% of the observed fusion events are kiss-and-run (16Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez d.T. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), but these occurrences are increased with elevated external Ca2+ concentrations (49Ales E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez d.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the absence of endocytosis caused by elevated osmolarity, one would expect these events to be restricted to the cell membrane, as shown in this work, until acted upon by external forces. For small vesicles, the force of matrix expansion is insufficient to destabilize the fusion pore, and kiss-and-run is more likely. This has also been observed for small clear vesicles at hippocampal synapses (50Stevens C.F. Williams J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).The hypertonically constructed kiss-and-hold configuration inhibits the dissociation of matrix constituents following vesicle fusion with the cell membrane. This provides access to the vesicle interior while maintaining the viability of the cell, which may allow for a more complete understanding of the complex interaction of molecules within the vesicle matrix in their natural environment as well as a glimpse of their dissociation during exocytosis. Under normal physiological conditions, full fusion and extrusion of vesicular contents is predominant at both mast and chromaffin cells, relying on the destabilization of the granule matrix through swelling to rapidly pass through the kiss-and-hold state. Vesicles in secretory cells perform two different functions: they are a storage depot for small molecules and they release these molecules during exocytosis. Storage in dense core vesicles requires stable packaging for an extended period of time. This is accomplished by association of the vesicular contents. On the other hand, release requires dissociation of this storage matrix on a relatively fast time scale so the contents can be extruded (1Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Marszalek P.E. Farrell B. Verdugo P. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1169-1183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In mast cells, histamine and 5-HT are associated with a negatively charged heparin matrix in the vesicles through a cation exchange type of interaction (3Uvnas B. Aborg C.H. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1984; 120: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These vesicles contain 150 mmhistamine, which alone with its associated anion would lead to a free osmolality of ∼550 mosm (4Fernandez J.M. Villalon M. Verdugo P. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the vesicles are iso-osmotic with the 300-mosm cytoplasm because of the association of the molecules within the granule matrix (5Brodwick M.S. Curran M. Edwards C. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, a single chromaffin cell vesicle contains 550 mmcatecholamine along with 122 mm ATP, 17–30 mmCa2+, 5 mm Mg2+, 22 mmascorbate, and the acidic protein chromogranin A, leading to a total soluble concentration of 750 mm (6Holz R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 175-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again, molecular associations lead to a state (7Helle K.B. Reed R.K. Pihl K.E. Serck-Hanssen G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1985; 123: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is iso-osmotic with the cytoplasm (6Holz R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 175-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These close associations have been documented by nuclear magnetic resonance in vesicles from both cell types (9Rabenstein D.L. Ludowyke R. Lagunoff D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6923-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Daniels A.J. Williams R.J. Wright P.E. Neuroscience. 1978; 3: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Upon cell stimulation, the vesicle contacts the plasma membrane and forms a fusion pore, the dynamics and control of which have been reviewed recently (11Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1999; 38: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Oheim M. Stuhmer W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2000; 29: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Capacitance and amperometry techniques have indicated that a portion of the vesicular contents can be released through this fusion pore (13Breckenridge L.J. Almers W. Nature. 1987; 328: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 14Neher E. Nature. 1993; 363: 497-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at both mast and chromaffin cells, patch-amperometry measurements reveal that the fusion pore can exist for several milliseconds prior to full extrusion of vesicle contents (15Alvarez d.T. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 16Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez d.T. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Following secretory vesicle-cell membrane fusion in mast cells vesicular swelling occurs (17Zimmerberg J. Curran M. Cohen F.S. Brodwick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which has been attributed to the displacement of associated cations in the granule with hydrated cations such as Na+ from the external solution (18Amatore C. Bouret Y. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This ion exchange mechanism, with its associated hydration effects (19Verdugo P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: S33-S37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been hypothesized and experimentally supported at several cell types as reviewed by Artalejoet al. (20Artalejo C.R. Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R62-R65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretical considerations of this process have likened the extrusion and swelling to a controlled explosion that drives full release of the vesicular contents and dissociation of the vesicular matrix (18Amatore C. Bouret Y. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Amperometric recordings revealed that the time course of release is longer than that expected for free diffusion (1Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), having a duration of several milliseconds at chromaffin cells (21Walker A. Glavinovic M.I. Trifaro J.M. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 431: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.J. Near J.A. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), and even longer at mast cells (23Marszalek P.E. Farrell B. Verdugo P. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1160-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), consistent with a rate-limiting dissociation. The time course of extrusion can be decreased by perturbing any of the physical and chemical gradients that exist between the vesicle interior and the extracellular environment. These include osmolarity, pH, and cation concentration (24Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Jankowski J.A.

J. 1996; 71: 1633-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, increasing the osmotic gradient by lowering the extracellular solution osmolarity decreases the release time course and increases the amount released, whereas high extracellular osmolarity has the opposite effect (27Borges R. Travis E.R. Hochstetler S.E. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8325-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present work, the effects of high osmolarity (using elevated NaCl) on secretory cells were evaluated in an attempt to freeze exocytotic events at the step between fusion pore formation and extrusion of vesicle contents. The results reported are consistent with such a state and reveal that extrusion of the vesicular contents is a distinct step in the sequence of events termed exocytosis. DISCUSSIONIn high osmolarity solutions, secretion from both mast and chromaffin cells is dramatically altered. The results presented here show that vesicle-cell membrane fusion can still occur under these conditions, but that full extrusion of the vesicle contents does not occur. Indeed, the fused vesicles in hypertonic solution appear to be frozen at the cell surface, and only release after swelling of the vesicle matrix is allowed to occur. Previous studies have demonstrated that both chromaffin and mast cell vesicles contract in response to hypertonic stress without disruption of their stored contents (5Brodwick M.S. Curran M. Edwards C. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, the chromaffin vesicle has been termed an ideal osmometer between 300 and 1000 mosm (6Holz R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 175-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The new finding of this work is that high osmolarity solutions prevent full extrusion of vesicle contents and allow temporal isolation of an intermediate state in the sequence of events that occur during exocytosis, a state we refer to as “kiss-and-hold.”Hypertonic solutions clearly lower the rate of exocytosis at both mast and chromaffin cells. This could arise from an increase in actin filaments at the cell membrane as found in neutrophils in hyperosmotic solutions (42Rizoli S.B. Rotstein O.D. Parodo J. Phillips M.J. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C619-C633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because the rate of exocytosis in chromaffin cells depends on the degree of association of actin filaments (43Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaro J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, previous visual studies in high osmolarity solutions have shown that vesicle-cell membrane fusion is not prevented at chromaffin or mast cells (17Zimmerberg J. Curran M. Cohen F.S. Brodwick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 44Breckenridge L.J. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), nor in sea urchin eggs (46Whitaker M. Zimmerberg J. J. Physiol. 1987; 389: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this work, vesicle-cell membrane fusion is established in chromaffin cells by the presence of DβH on the cell surface in both isotonic and hypertonic medium. DβH labeling is lowered in hypertonic solutions, correlating well with the decreased frequency of electrochemically detected spikes. At mast cells, visual evidence for vesicle-cell membrane fusion was not obtained in hypertonic medium, although secretion was clearly evident by the cyclic voltammetry. The secretory events that are seen are so small that they resemble the feet that precede some exocytotic events in iso-osmolar solutions at both types of cells in hypertonic media.

Physiol Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). Upon exposure to the extracellular solution through the fusion pore, at the initial “kiss,” exchange between the vesicular interior and the extracellular fluid begins. Normally the matrix dissociation and extrusion of its contents relies on hydration, with its accompanying matrix swelling, that is driven by a physical or chemical gradient across the fusion pore. By removing the osmotic gradient in hypertonic solutions, one of the driving forces for dissociation and extrusion is dissipated. The small amount of secretion that does occur could arise from components originally in an unassociated state or a small amount of matrix dissociation that occurs at the fusion pore, but which is unable to propagate into the remainder of the vesicle.

For cells stimulated with K+, the original stimulus is no longer present upon isotonic solution exposure, and yet secretion is still observed. This strongly suggests that the observed spikes arise from previously fused vesicles. With Ba2+ at chromaffin cells and with mast cells, the isotonic-evoked spikes are unaccompanied by an increase in intracellular divalent ions. Thus, it is clear that the discrete processes of vesicle fusion and vesicle extrusion have been temporally separated. Concentration and pH gradients between the vesicle matrix and the external solution may exert similar effects (24Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,25Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Ciolkowski E.L. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14694-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, chromaffin cells previously stimulated with Ba2+ in hypertonic solutions did not release when exposed to isotonic buffer at pH 5.5 (data not shown). Thus, re-establishing an osmotic gradient is not sufficient to unravel the kiss and hold state; the pH gradient is necessary as well.All of these results are consistent with recent mathematical models for the swelling of secretory granules after fusion pore formation and its role in extrusion of granule contents (18Amatore C. Bouret Y. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 48Chizmadzhev Y.A. Kuzmin P.I. Kumenko D.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys.

These models indicate that the hydration and swelling of the vesicle matrix cause an enlargement of the fusion pore leading to its destabilization. Thus, normally in mast and chromaffin cells the pore expansion of the vesicle occurs rapidly, driven by the irreversible swelling of the matrix, and results in full incorporation of the vesicle membrane and extrusion of vesicular contents as illustrated in the sequence of steps in Fig.6.

The mathematical models predict that “kiss-and-run” events, events where fusion pore formation allows escape of some transmitter followed by vesicular retreat from the cellular membrane without fully fusing, are unlikely under normal conditions at cells with large vesicles. Consistent with these models, all fusion pore events in mast cells are followed by complete fusion of the vesicle with the cellular membrane and subsequent release (15Alvarez d.T. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Patch-amperometry studies on chromaffin cells reveal only 10% of the observed fusion events are kiss-and-run (16Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez d.T. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), but these occurrences are increased with elevated external Ca2+ concentrations (49Ales E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez d.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the absence of endocytosis caused by elevated osmolarity, one would expect these events to be restricted to the cell membrane, as shown in this work, until acted upon by external forces. For small vesicles, the force of matrix expansion is insufficient to destabilize the fusion pore, and kiss-and-run is more likely. This has also been observed for small clear vesicles at hippocampal synapses (50Stevens C.F. Williams J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Indeed, chromaffin cells previously stimulated with Ba2+ in hypertonic solutions did not release when exposed to isotonic buffer at pH 5.5 (data not shown). Thus, re-establishing an osmotic gradient is not sufficient to unravel the kiss and hold state; the pH gradient is necessary as well. All of these results are consistent with recent mathematical models for the swelling of secretory granules after fusion pore formation and its role in extrusion of granule contents (18Amatore C. Bouret Y. Travis E.R. Wightman R.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 48Chizmadzhev Y.A. Kuzmin P.I. Kumenko D.A. Zimmerberg J. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2241-2256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These models indicate that the hydration and swelling of the vesicle matrix cause an enlargement of the fusion pore leading to its destabilization. Thus, normally in mast and chromaffin cells the pore expansion of the vesicle occurs rapidly, driven by the irreversible swelling of the matrix, and results in full incorporation of the vesicle membrane and extrusion of vesicular contents as illustrated in the sequence of steps in Fig.6. By removing the driving force for swelling, we were able to isolate the intermediate kiss-and-hold state. The mathematical models predict that “kiss-and-run” events, events where fusion pore formation allows escape of some transmitter followed by vesicular retreat from the cellular membrane without fully fusing, are unlikely under normal conditions at cells with large vesicles. Consistent with these models, all fusion pore events in mast cells are followed by complete fusion of the vesicle with the cellular membrane and subsequent release (15Alvarez d.T. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Patch-amperometry studies on chromaffin cells reveal only 10% of the observed fusion events are kiss-and-run (16Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez d.T. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), but these occurrences are increased with elevated external Ca2+ concentrations (49Ales E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M. Alvarez d.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the absence of endocytosis caused by elevated osmolarity, one would expect these events to be restricted to the cell membrane, as shown in this work, until acted upon by external forces. For small vesicles, the force of matrix expansion is insufficient to destabilize the fusion pore, and kiss-and-run is more likely. This has also been observed for small clear vesicles at hippocampal synapses (50Stevens C.F. Williams J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The hypertonically constructed kiss-and-hold configuration inhibits the dissociation of matrix constituents following vesicle fusion with the cell membrane. This provides access to the vesicle interior while maintaining the viability of the cell, which may allow for a more complete understanding of the complex interaction of molecules within the vesicle matrix in their natural environment as well as a glimpse of their dissociation during exocytosis. Under normal physiological conditions, full fusion and extrusion of vesicular contents is predominant at both mast and chromaffin cells, relying on the destabilization of the granule matrix through swelling to rapidly pass through the kiss-and-hold state."

To determine the downstream target of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase action, we examined the role of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt using SB203580 in hepatocytes as well as by transfection with a dominant negative (DN-PKB) or a constitutively active (CA-PKB) form of PKB in HuH-Ntcp cells. Both cAMP and cell swelling stimulated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase as well as PKB activity. Although 100 μm SB203580 inhibited cell swelling- and 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP-induced activation of both p38 MAP kinase and PKB, 1 μm SB203580 inhibited activation of p38 MAP kinase, but not of PKB, in hepatocytes. 100 μm, but not 1 μm SB203580, inhibited cell swelling- and cAMP-induced increases in taurocholate (TC) uptake and Ntcp translocation in hepatocytes. TC uptake in HuH-Ntcp cells was more than 90% dependent on extracellular Na+. Cyclic AMP and cell swelling increased TC uptake by 50–100% and PKB activity 2–4-fold in HuH-Ntcp cells transfected with the empty vector and failed to increase PKB activity, TC uptake, and Ntcp translocation in DN-PKB-transfected HuH-Ntcp cells. Transfection with CA-PKB increased PKB activity, TC uptake, and Ntcp translocation in HuH-Ntcp cells compared with cells transfected with the empty vector. In contrast, transfection with DN-PKB did not affect basal PKB activity, TC uptake, or Ntcp translocation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that cell swelling and cAMP-mediated stimulation of hepatic Na+/TC cotransport and Ntcp translocation requires activation of PKB and is mediated at least in part via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/PKB-signaling pathway.

These results raise the possibility that PKB may be involved in the regulation of Na+/TC cotransport and Ntcp translocation in hepatocytes. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the effect of cAMP and cell swelling on Na+/TC cotransport and Ntcp translocation is mediated via PKB. The role of PKB was evaluated by SB203580, a known inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, which has recently been shown to inhibit PKB at higher concentrations in human and murine T cells (25Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition, we studied the effect of transient transfection with a dominant negative or a constitutively active PKB construct on TC uptake in HuH-Ntcp cell lines. Results suggest that activation of PKB is necessary for cell swelling- and cAMP-mediated increases in Na+/TC cotransport and Ntcp translocation. TC (Na+ salt), SB203580, and SB202474 were purchased from Calbiochem. CPT-cAMP, aprotinin, leupeptin, okadaic acid, wortmannin, and collagenase were obtained from Sigma. PKB assay kit was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), p38 MAP kinase antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA) and LipofectAMINE® reagent kit was from Invitrogen. [24-14C]TC (56 mCi/mmol), [methoxy-3H]inulin (80 Ci/mmol), and [γ32-P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Male Wistar rats (200–300g) obtained from Charles River Laboratories served as liver donors. Hepatocytes were isolated from rat livers using a previously described collagenase perfusion method (30Anwer M.S. Kroker R. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared hepatocytes suspended (100 mg of wet weight/ml) in a HEPES assay buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, and 5 mmglucose were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under air before initiating studies. Hepatocytes were pretreated with SB203580 (1–100 μm) for 30 min followed by incubation with 10 μm CPT-cAMP for 15 min or hypotonic solution (160 mosmol) for 25 min as previously described (23Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 24Webster C.R.L. Blanch C.J. Philips J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol.

This was followed by determination of TC uptake, Ntcp translocation, and activities of p38 MAP kinase and PKB. Details of these experiments are given in the legends of each figure. All studies were repeated in at least three different cell preparations. HuH-Ntcp cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 1.2 g/liter G418 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% O2 air incubator. For transfection experiments, cells (3 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates) were cultured for 24 h in the culture medium. Cells were then transiently transfected with a PKB plasmid using LipofectAMINE according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were transfected by adding 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I containing 0.0025 μl LipofectAMINE and 0.5 μg of dominant negative (DN)-PKB or CA-PKB. After 24 h of incubation in the transfection medium, cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in 0.5 ml of culture media. Cells were then incubated in HEPES buffer (above) for 3 h at 37 °C before determining TC uptake, Ntcp translocation, and PKB activity. The initial uptake rate of TC in hepatocytes was determined as previously described (31Anwer M.S. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 181-192PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at various times after incubation of hepatocytes with SB203580 and/or CPT-cAMP or hypotonic media, an aliquot of cell suspension (5–8 mg protein/ml) was withdrawn and used to determine the initial uptake rate of TC (20 μm). Transport was initiated by adding cells to the incubation medium containing [14C]TC and [3H]inulin, with uptake determined at different time points. Initial uptake rates were calculated from the slope of the linear portion of time-dependent uptake curves and expressed in nmol/min/mg of protein. TC uptake in HuH-Ntcp cells was determined after incubation with 100 μm CPT-cAMP (15 min) or in a hypotonic medium (25 min) by incubating with 20 μm TC containing [3H]TC (100 dpm/pmol) for 2 min. Cells were then washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer and lysed in 0.25 ml of a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 500 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mmorthovanadate (pH 7.5). Aliquots of cell lysate were used to quantitate radioactivity, protein, and PKB activity. TC uptake in HuH-Ntcp was linear for at least 3 min, and the 2-min uptake was used to calculate initial TC uptake rate expressed in pmol/min/mg of protein. To determine whether SB203580 affects cAMP- and cell swelling-induced Ntcp translocation, hepatocytes were pretreated with 1 or 100 μm SB203580 for 30 min before incubating with 10 μm CPT-cAMP for 15 min or in a hypotonic medium for 25 min. Cell surface proteins were then biotinylated followed by separation of biotinylated proteins and detection of Ntcp using immunoblot analysis as described previously (23Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 24Webster C.R.L. Blanch C.J. Philips J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29754-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A similar method was used to determine Ntcp translocation in HuH-Ntcp cells. Briefly, hepatocytes (or HuH-Ntcp cells) were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 8.0) and then exposed to sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C followed by washing 3 times with excess PBS. Cell pellets were lysed by incubating in a lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, and the lysates were used to determine biotinylated and total Ntcp mass. To assay for biotinylated Ntcp, the lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads for 1 h. The beads were separated by centrifugation followed by washing with lysis buffer and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min followed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant, containing biotinylated proteins, was subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine plasma membrane Ntcp. For immunoblot analysis, proteins (10–50 μg) from whole cell lysates (total Ntcp) and supernatant containing biotinylated proteins (plasma membrane Ntcp) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE by the method of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206896) Google Scholar) as previously described (33Mukhopadhayay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically from SDS gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Transblot, Transfer Membrane, 0.45 micron from Bio-Rad) and probed with the Ntcp antibody (1:2000 dilution). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed with the Amersham ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates obtained after various treatments of hepatocytes and HuH-Ntcp cells were assayed for PKB activity using commercially available assay kits. The assay of PKB involved immunoprecipitation of PKB followed by in vitrokinase assay using Crosstide as the substrate. PKB was immunoprecipitated by incubating 100 μg of total cellular protein, and the immunocomplexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 30 μl of reaction mixture (kinase buffer containing 200 μmATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μmCrosstide). After the reaction, an aliquot (15 μl) of the supernatant was transferred into Whatman p81 filter paper and washed 4 times with 3 ml of 175 mm phosphoric acid and once with distilled water. The filters were air-dried and then counted in a scintillation counter. PKB activity was expressed in pmol of PO43−/min/mg of protein. For p38 MAP kinase, hepatocyte lysates (100–150 μg of total protein) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically from SDS gels to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody (1:1,000 dilution) to detect the activated form of p38 MAP kinase. The blot was stripped and reprobed with p38 MAP kinase antibody (1:1,000 dilution) to detect total p38 MAP kinase. The immunoblots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Lowry method was used to determine cell protein (34Lowry D.H. Rosenberg N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were scanned in gray scale using Adobe Photoshop® (Adobe System Inc., San Jose, CA), and the relative band densities were quantitated using Sigmal Gel® (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). All values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Paired t test was used to statistically analyze data with p < 0.05 considered significant. SB203580, a known inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, has been shown to inhibit PKB in murine T cell line, CT6, and primary human T cells (25Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To determine whether SB203580 also inhibits PKB activity in hepatocytes, we determined the concentration-dependent effect of SB203580 on p38 MAP kinase and PKB activity in cAMP-stimulated hepatocytes. Cyclic AMP stimulated p38 MAP kinase activity by 50%, and this effect was inhibited completely by 1 μm SB203580 (Fig.1). In contrast, cAMP-stimulated PKB activity was not inhibited by 1 μm SB203580. However, 10 and 100 μm SB203580 inhibited significantly and completely, respectively, cAMP-induced increases in PKB activity (Fig.1, upper panel). SB202474, an inactive analogue of SB203580, did not affect either the basal or cAMP-stimulated PKB activity (data not shown). Thus, as in T cells, SB203580 inhibits PKB activity in hepatocytes at a concentration 10 times higher than the concentration needed to inhibit p38 MAP kinase. We also observed similar inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor-induced increases in p38 MAP kinase and PKB activity by SB203580 (data not shown). To distinguish the effects mediated via inhibition of p38 MAP kinase or PKB, further studies in hepatocytes were conducted using 1 and 100 μmSB203580. SB203580 did not inhibit basal TC uptake (Fig. 1, lower panel). However, cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake were inhibited by 100 μm but not by 1 μmSB203580. Similar concentrations of SB202474 did not affect either basal or cAMP-stimulated TC uptake (data not shown). Cyclic AMP-mediated increases in plasma membrane Ntcp were also inhibited by 100 μm but not by 1 μm SB203580 (Fig.2). Thus, SB203580 appears to inhibit cAMP-mediated increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation by inhibiting PKB and not p38 MAP kinase. Cell swelling induced by exposing hepatocytes to hypotonic media has previously been shown to stimulate PI 3-kinase-dependent PKB activity and Ntcp translocation in hepatocytes (24Webster C.R.L.

To determine whether cell swelling-induced increases in Ntcp translocation is mediated via PKB, we studied the effect of SB203580. Cell swelling increased PKB activity by 3–4-fold and P38 MAP kinase activity by 40–60% (Fig.3, upper panel). Although 1 μm SB203580-inhibited cell swelling induced increases in p38 MAP kinase, but not PKB activity, 100 μm SB203580 inhibited p38 MAP kinase as well as PKB activity. Cell swelling increased TC uptake by 2-fold as in a previous study (24Webster C.R.L. Blanch C.J. Philips J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29754-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and this effect was inhibited by100 μm, but not by 1 μm SB203580 (Fig. 3, lower panel). Cell swelling also increased plasma membrane Ntcp, and this effect was inhibited by 100 μm, but not by 1 μmSB203580 (Fig. 4). Thus, the inhibitory effect of SB203580 appears to be mediated via PKB and not p38 MAP kinase.Figure 4SB203580 inhibits cell swelling-induced Ntcp translocation in hepatocytes. Cells were treated with Me2SO (0 μ m SB) or 1 or 100 μm SB203580 (SB) for 30 min followed by exposure to a hypotonic medium (HYPO). After an additional 25-min incubation, cell surface proteins were biotinylated, and plasma membrane Ntcp (PM-Ntcp) was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical Ntcp immunoblots are shown in the upper panel, and results of densitometric analysis (means ± S.E.; n = 4) are shown in thelower panel. *, significantly different from respective controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further determine the role of PKB, studies were conducted in HuH-Ntcp cells transfected with DN-PKB. Sodium-dependent TC uptake has previously been shown in HuH-Ntcp cells (27Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R. El Deiry W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38610-38618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Studies in the presence and absence of extracellular Na+ showed that more than 90% of TC uptake was Na+-dependent (350 ± 25versus 21 ± 2.7 pmol/min/mg of protein;n = 3). In addition, TC uptake was not affected in cells transfected with the empty vector. Preliminary studies showed that cAMP and cell-swelling increased TC uptake and PKB activity in HuH-Ntcp cells. To determine the role of PKB, effects of cAMP and cell swelling on TC uptake and PKB activity were determined in HuH-Ntcp cells transfected with DN-PKB. Expression of DN-PKB was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Cyclic AMP as well as cell swelling stimulated TC uptake by 50–100% (Fig.5, lower panel) and PKB activity by 3–4-fold (Fig. 5, upper panel) in HuH-Ntcp cells. Basal TC uptake and PKB activity were not affected by DN-PKB (Fig. 5). However, cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and PKB activity were inhibited in cells transfected with DN-PKB. Cyclic AMP and cell swelling also increased plasma membrane Ntcp in HuH-Ntcp cells, and this effect was inhibited in cells transfected with DN-PKB (Fig. 6). These results indicate that cAMP- and cell swelling-induced Ntcp translocation to the plasma membrane is dependent on PKB activity.Figure 6DN-PKB inhibits cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in Ntcp translocation in HuH-Ntcp cells. Cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (EV) or DN-PKB and treated as in Fig. 5. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated, and plasma membrane Ntcp (PM-Ntcp) was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical Ntcp immunoblots are shown in the upper panel, and results of densitometric analysis (means ± S.E.;n = 5) are shown in the lower panel.#, significantly different from control; *, significantly different from empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The above studies would indicate that stimulation of TC uptake and Ntcp translocation by cAMP and cell swelling results from activation of PKB. In that case, activation of PKB independent of cAMP and cell swelling should also stimulate TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. This hypothesis was tested by determining TC uptake and Ntcp translocation in HuH-Ntcp cells transiently transfected with CA-PKB. Preliminary studies showed that transfection of HuH-Ntcp cells with 0.1 μg of CA-PKB produced an inconsistent increase (0–1-fold) in PKB activity. However, transfection with 0.5 and 1.0 μg of CA-PKB resulted in 10- and 15-fold increases in PKB activity, respectively. Because cAMP and cell swelling increased PKB activity by 2–4-fold in HuH-Ntcp cells (Fig.5), further studies were conducted in cells transfected with 0.5 μg of CA-PKB. Transfection with CA-PKB resulted in a 10-fold increase in PKB activity and a 65% increase in TC uptake (Fig.7). Transfection with CA-PKB also increased plasma membrane Ntcp by 75% without affecting total Ntcp (Fig. 8). The increase in plasma membrane Ntcp is not due to an increase in Ntcp synthesis, since total Ntcp level was unaffected by CA-PKB. Thus, CA-PKB stimulates Ntcp translocation to the plasma membrane. These effects of CA-PKB transfection were not affected when PI3K was inhibited by wortmannin (Figs. 7 and 8), indicating that PKB is downstream of PI 3-kinase. These results support the hypothesis that PKB mediates cAMP and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation.Figure 8CA-PKB stimulates Ntcp translocation in HuH-Ntcp cells in the presence and absence of wortmannin. Cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (EV) or CA-PKB and treated as in Fig. 7. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated, and plasma membrane Ntcp (PM-Ntcp) as well as cell lysate Ntcp (Total Ntcp) was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical Ntcp immunoblots are shown in the upper panel, and results of densitometric analysis (means ± S.E.; n = 3–5) are shown in thelower panel. *, significantly different from empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The present study was designed to determine the role of PKB in cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. Although previous studies (23Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 24Webster C.R.L. Blanch C.J. Philips J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29754-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) raised the possibility of a role for PKB, no direct evidence was presented. In the present study, the role of PKB was assessed using two different approaches, namely inhibitor and transfection studies. Results of these studies are consistent with a role for PKB as discussed below. The first series of studies in hepatocytes showed that SB203580, a known inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, inhibits cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in PKB activity at a concentration higher than that needed to inhibit p38 MAP kinase activity (Figs. 1 and 3). SB203580 has previously been shown to inhibit interleukin-2-stimulated PKB activity by inhibiting the PKB kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, in murine and human T cells (25Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, SB203580 does not inhibit insulin-stimulated PKB activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (35Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of PKB activity by SB203580 may be cell- as well as stimulant-dependent. Cyclic AMP and cell swelling activated p38 MAP kinase as well as PKB in hepatocytes. However, it is unlikely that cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation is mediated via p38 MAP kinase, since 1 μm SB203580, which inhibited p38 MAP kinase (Figs. 1 and 3), did not inhibit TC uptake and Ntcp translocation stimulated by cAMP and cell swelling (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). On the other hand, inhibition of PKB activity by 100 μmSB203580 was associated with inhibition of cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. These results suggest that cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation may be mediated via PKB. It is, however, possible that the effect of SB203580 on TC uptake and Ntcp translocation is unrelated to its effect on PKB. Thus, studies were conducted in HuH-Ntcp cells transiently transfected with DN-PKB and CA-PKB to obtain more direct evidence in support of a role for PKB. Our studies in HuH-Ntcp cells (Figs. 5 and 6) show that cAMP and cell swelling stimulate PKB, TC uptake, and Ntcp translocation. These results are similar to those observed in hepatocytes (23Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 24Webster C.R.L. Blanch C.J. Philips J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29754-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of cAMP and cell swelling to stimulate PKB was inhibited when HuH-Ntcp cells were transiently transfected with DN-PKB, and this was associated with inhibition of cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation (Fig. 5 and 6). In addition, stimulation of PKB in HuH-Ntcp cells by CA-PKB resulted in stimulation of TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. These results indicate that the stimulation of PKB activity is required for cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. The role of PKB in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation has been supported by similar studies with constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of PKB in various cell types (5Hernandez R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of transporter translocation may be a general mechanism by which PKB regulates solute transport in various cell types. Our previous studies show that cAMP- and cell swelling-induced increases in PKB activity are dependent on PI 3-kinase (23Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 24Webster C.R.L. Blanch C.J. Philips J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29754-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our present study showed that CA-PKB can stimulate TC uptake and Ntcp translocation when PI 3-kinase is inhibited by wortmannin (Figs. 7 and8). Thus, the stimulation of Ntcp translocation by cAMP and cell swelling can be proposed to involve activation of PI 3-kinase followed by activation of PKB. The mechanism by which PKB stimulates Ntcp translocation is unclear. Because cAMP-mediated stimulation of Ntcp translocation is dependent on intact microfilament (23Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dranoff J.A. McClure M. Burgstahler A.D. Denson L.A. Crawford A.R. Crawford J.M. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is possible that PKB stimulates microfilament-dependent movement of Ntcp-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. PKB has been suggested to stimulate GLUT4 translocation by accelerating inter-endosomal transit of GLUT4-containing vesicle (9Foster L.J. Li D. Randhawa V.K. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether such a mechanism may also be involved in PKB-mediated Ntcp translocation cannot be evaluated at this time since intracellular vesicular compartments for Ntcp have not yet been definitely established. A recent study shows that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubules by SB203680 prevents insulin-stimulated glucose uptake but not GLUT4 translocation (35Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The present study also showed that cAMP and cell swelling stimulate p38 MAP kinase in hepatocytes (Figs. 1 and 3). Because inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by 1 μm SB203580 did not inhibit cAMP- or cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation, it is likely that neither TC uptake nor Ntcp translocation is mediated via a p38 MAPK kinase pathway. However, cAMP-stimulated p38 MAP kinase may be involved in cAMP-stimulated secretion of bile acids (37Hayakawa T. Bruck R. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G727-G735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Bsep translocation (38Misra S. Ujhazy P. Arias I.M. Varticovski L. Hepatology. 1999; 30 (abstr.): 306Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that tauroursodeoxycholate and cell swelling stimulate Bsep translocation via a p38 MAP kinase pathway (39Kurz A.K. Graf D. Schmitt M. Dahl S.V. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that cAMP-stimulated Bsep translocation is also mediated via a p38 MAP kinase pathway. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests that the stimulation of TC uptake and Ntcp translocation by cAMP and cell swelling is mediated via a PI 3-kinase/PKB signaling pathway in hepatocytes.

The ability of Smads to modulate transcription results from a functional cooperativity with the coactivators p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP), or the corepressors TGIF and Ski. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, another downstream target activated by TGF-β receptors, has also been suggested to inhibit TGF-β signaling through interaction of c-Jun with Smad2 and Smad3. Here we show that c-Jun directly interacts with Ski to enhance the association of Ski with Smad2 in the basal state. Interestingly, TGF-β signaling induces dissociation of c-Jun from Ski, thereby relieving active repression by c-Jun. Moreover, activation of JNK pathway suppressed the ability of TGF-β to induce dissociation of c-Jun from ski. Thus, the formation of a c-Jun/Ski complex maintains the repressed state of Smad2-responsive genes in the absence of ligand and participates in negative feedback regulation of TGF-β signaling by the JNK cascade.

Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive analysis of TGF-β signaling pathways has demonstrated that the transduction of TGF-β signals to the nucleus is accomplished by the sequential association of type II and type I receptors and Smad protein cascades (2Heldin C.H.

Binding of ligands to the type II receptor causes phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor, leading to phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 on C-terminal serine residues (1Massagué J.

Once phosphorylated, Smad2 or Smad3 associates with Smad4, and the resulting complexes move into the nucleus to regulate expression of a large number of target genes, most of which remain to be identified (1Massagué J.

By interacting directly with promoter sequences or with DNA-binding proteins, Smad complexes positively or negatively regulate the transcription of target genes depending on physiological context (1Massagué J.

Transcription activation by Smad proteins has been shown to occur, in part at least, by their ability to recruit the general coactivators p300 and CBP (7Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 8Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 2: 2114-2119Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 9Pouponnot C.

By contrast, Smad2 or Smad3 can also interact with the corepressor TGIF in response to TGF-β, thereby forming a transcriptional repressor complex (11Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the repression of Smad-dependent transcription by TGIF correlates with the recruitment of a histone deacetylase instead of the coactivators p300/CBP into the Smad complex (11Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has also been proposed to explain the action of the corepressor Ski, which interacts with Smads on TGF-β-responsive promoters and represses their ability to activate TGF-β target genes by assembling a repressor complex containing N-CoR, Sin3, and a histone deacetylase (12Akiyoshi S.

Analogous to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, the prototypical JNK pathway involves the sequential activation of the protein kinases MAPK kinase kinase1 (MEKK1), MAPK kinase4 (MKK4), and JNK (20Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Once activated, JNK phosphorylates the transactivating domain of c-Jun protein at serine residues 63 and 73, and, in turn, phosphorylated c-Jun up-regulates the expression of a number of genes containing AP1 sites at their promoter, including c-Jun itself (21Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 22Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). In addition to activating transcription of target genes, the phosphorylated c-Jun can interact with the corepressor TGIF to repress Smad2 transcriptional activity (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interaction of activated c-Jun with TGIF may prevent the recruitment of p300/CBP to TGF-β-activated Smad2, thus reducing the ability of the Smad complex to activate transcription (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Given the established role of Ski in interfering with the assembly of Smad2 and the coactivators p300/CBP in response to TGF-β signaling (12Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35269-35277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), we postulated that c-Jun may be able to recruit different transcriptional corepressors depending on cell type or physiological context. In this study, we provide evidence that c-Jun interacts with Ski in the absence of TGF-β signaling, thereby stabilizing the Ski/Smad2 corepressor complex. Interestingly, the interaction between c-Jun and Ski was increased on activation of JNK signaling pathway, suggesting that the association of c-Jun with Ski may have an important role in the JNK-dependent repression of Smad2 transcriptional activity. The immortalized mouse embryonic cells (MEF3T3) were a generous gift from Dr. E. Böttinger. COS-7, HepG2, and 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. For gene expression analysis, cells were plated to semiconfluency and 24 h later were transfected with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINE method as described previously (23Prunier C. Ferrand N. Frottier B. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3302-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To induce the luciferase reporter, cells were treated with human TGF-β1 (Sigma) at 2 ng/ml for 16 h. Extracts were then prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system described by the manufacturer (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency using a β-galactosidase expressing vector (pCMV5.LacZ) and the Galacto-Star system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed at 4 °C in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody for 2 h, followed by adsorption to Sepharose-coupled protein G for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates and aliquots of cell lysates before immunoprecipitation were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit, goat, or mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). GST pulldown experiments were performed as described (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with in vitrotranslated c-Jun in RIPA buffer for 2 h at 4 °C and washed four times with the same buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS/PAGE and bound c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS-7 cells, transfected with FLAG-Ski and c-Jun together with wild-type or constitutively activated TGF-β type I receptors, were transferred into medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. After 48 h, the slides were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mixture of monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 and rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Jun antibodies. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, and examined on a Leica confocal microscope. We have previously reported that c-Jun specifically interacts with the Smad corepressor TGIF in response to TGF-β signaling (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TGF-β-dependent interaction of c-Jun with TGIF is physiologically relevant, we compared the effects of ectopically expressed TGIF or c-Jun on TGF-β/Smad2-dependent transcription responses using HepG2 cells or immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF3T3). We chose to focus our analysis on Xenopus mix.2 promoter as a target of Smad2 because activation of mix.2 by TGF-β requires the formation of a Smad2-Smad4-FAST1 complex that binds to a sequence promoter known as the TGF-β/activin response element (24Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In mouse MEF3T3 cells, significantly increased activation of the ARE-Lux reporter in response to TGF-β were detected in cells transfected with FAST1. Unexpectedly, while cotransfection of c-Jun with FAST1 resulted in a marked inhibition of TGF-β-induced ARE-Lux activity, cotransfection of TGIF did not even at the highest amounts of transfected cDNA (Fig. 1 Aand data not shown). Under the same experimental conditions, transfection of HepG2 cells with the expression vector encoding TGIF blocked the ligand-dependent induction of luciferase activity with an efficiency approaching that elicited by transfection of c-Jun (Fig. 1 B), consistent with published results (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). From these results, it can be suggested that c-Jun may repress Smad2 transcriptional activity by recruiting different transcriptional corepressors depending on cell type or physiological context. Within the nucleus, the transcriptional activity of nuclear Smad complexes can also be repressed by Ski, which, like TGIF, interacts with Smad2/3 on TGF-β-responsive promoters resulting in the recruitment of N-CoR and its associated histone deacetylase (12Akiyoshi S.

As a first step toward understanding the mechanism underlying the inhibitory function of c-Jun, we cotransfected MEF3T3 cells with an expression vector encoding Ski together with the ARE-Lux reporter and FAST1. As shown in Fig.1 A, expression of Ski blocked the TGF-β-dependent activation of the reporter gene with activity similar to c-Jun. Because c-Jun has been shown to interact with Smad2 (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Liberati N.T. Datto M.B.

Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we next sought to determine whether c-Jun could stabilize the Smad2/Ski complex. For this, 293 cells were transfected with Myc-Smad2 and FLAG-Ski in the presence or absence of HA-c-Jun. Similar to previous observations (12Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35269-35277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), association of Smad2 with Ski was strongly increased following exposure of cells to TGF-β (Fig.1 C). Surprisingly, cotransfection of c-Jun resulted in a ligand-independent increase in the amount of Smad2 present in FLAG-Ski immunocomplexes, suggesting that c-Jun can stabilize the Smad2/Ski complex in the absence of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 1 C). To approach the question of how c-Jun stabilizes the Smad2/Ski complex, we looked for possible interactions between c-Jun and Ski through transient transfections using COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from transfected cells with the anti-HA antibody directed against HA-c-Jun revealed the presence of FLAG-Ski, which was absent in a control transfection in which only FLAG-Ski was expressed (Fig.2 A). Next, we looked for a direct interaction between Ski and c-Jun. Incubation of the in vitro transcribed and translated product of c-Jun with Ski linked to GST and expressed in bacteria showed that Ski was able to interact directly with c-Jun (Fig. 2 B). To begin to understand the interaction of Ski and c-Jun, various FLAG epitope Ski constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells and tested for interaction with cotransfected HA-c-Jun. As shown in Fig.3 A, a Ski fragment between residues 338 and 490 was sufficient for interaction with c-Jun. However, inclusion of the C terminus region precludes this interaction, indicating that this element may be altering the conformation of the truncated protein in such a way as to interfere with the ability of Ski to interact with c-Jun. Further analysis using a fragment of c-Jun (c-Jun-b-Zip) in this assay showed that the Ski-interacting region of c-Jun maps to the C terminus domain of c-Jun, including the DNA binding domain and the leucine zipper region (Fig. 3 B). It should be noted that the c-Jun-b-Zip mutant was obtained by removing the N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun that includes the binding site for JNK (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicating that the phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK is not required for the assembly of the c-Jun/Ski complex. In the course of these analyses, we also characterized the domains in Ski that mediate binding to Smad2 protein, using our panel of Ski mutants with Myc-Smad2. As previously described (12Akiyoshi S.

Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the N-terminal portion of Ski (residues 1–490) is responsible for binding to Smad2 (Fig.3 C). Interestingly, the c-Jun-interacting region of c-Jun (338–490) failed to bind Smad2 despite efficient expression of the truncated protein (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that Ski contains discrete binding sites for Smad2 and c-Jun. To ascertain for the physiological relevance of the interaction of Ski with c-Jun, we examined the effect of Ski on c-Jun-mediated transcriptional activation of an AP1-Lux reporter, which contains AP1 sites, is c-Jun responsive, and drives expression of a luciferase gene (18Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This reporter had minimal basal activity in HepG2 cells but when it was cotransfected with c-Jun, we observed a strong induction of the reporter gene (Fig. 4). In cells cotransfected with Ski, we observed a significant repression of c-Jun-mediated transcriptional responses (Fig. 4), providing support for a functional interaction between c-Jun and Ski. To examine whether activation of TGF-β signaling might influence the interaction of c-Jun with Ski, COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-Ski, HA-c-Jun and either wild-type or activated TβRI (TβRI.act), which contains a substitution of threonine residue 204 to aspartate and signals TGF-β responses in the absence of ligand and the type II receptor (26Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Complexes were precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody for the presence of c-Jun. In the absence of TGF-β signaling, constitutive interaction between Ski and c-Jun was detected. In contrast, in cells coexpressing the activated type I receptor, we observed a significant decrease in the interaction of Ski with c-Jun (Fig.5 A). A similar dissociation was obtained with transfected 293 cells (Fig. 5 B) or HepG2 cells (see Fig. 6) upon TGF-β treatment, indicating that the TGF-β-dependent dissociation of Ski from c-Jun can occur in multiple cell lines.Figure 6Activation of JNK cascade stabilized the Ski/c-Jun complex. HepG2 cells were transfected with combinations of HA-c-Jun, FLAG-Ski, and the constitutively activated mutants MEKK1.EE and MKK4.ED, or the dominant-negative mutants MEKK1.K432A and MKK4.Ala. Then, cells were treated with or without TGF-β for 1 h. The association of Ski with c-Jun was analyzed by blotting the FLAG immunoprecipitates with the anti-HA antibody. The expression of HA-c-Jun and FLAG-Ski was monitored by direct immunoblotting. The results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also tested for interaction between endogenous Ski and c-Jun. For this, c-Jun was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells using a rabbit polyclonal c-Jun antibody, and Ski was visualized by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-Ski antibody. In immunoprecipitated c-Jun prepared with normal antisera, no Ski was detectable (Fig.5 C). However, in the anti-c-Jun immunoprecipitates, we could clearly detect Ski coprecipitating with c-Jun (Fig. 5 C). More importantly, TGF-β treatment prior to lysis revealed decreased association of c-Jun with Ski, consistent with our previous results in transfected cells (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that c-Jun can physiologically interact with Ski and further suggest that TGF-β signaling induces dissociation of c-Jun/Ski complexes. To further confirm the in vivo association between Ski and c-Jun, we then examined the subcellular localization of Ski and c-Jun in transfected COS-7 cells using laser confocal microscopy. In cells expressing c-Ski alone, the Ski immunoreactivity was dispersed throughout the cell (Fig. 5 D), consistent with published results (27Reed J.A. Bales E. Xu W. Okan N.A. Bandyopadhyay D. Medrano E.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8074-8078PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when c-Ski was coexpressed together with c-Jun, Ski was found predominantly in the nucleus and was extensively colocalized with c-Jun, suggesting that c-Jun expression leads to the import of Ski to the nucleus (Fig. 5 D). As expected, c-Jun was detected predominantly in the nucleus of the transfected cells in the presence or absence of cotransfected Ski (Fig.5 D and data not shown). Our previous analysis showed that activation of TGF-β signaling induces the dissociation of Ski from c-Jun. To explore in more detail how the subcellular distribution of Ski and c-Jun is controlled, we examined how TGF-β signaling regulates Ski and c-Jun localization. For this, we expressed in COS-7 cells Ski and c-Jun in the presence of the constitutively activated type I receptor. Analysis of c-Jun revealed that coexpression of the activated type I receptor did not appreciably affect the staining pattern. In contrast, a substantial proportion of Ski redistributed to the cytoplasm despite efficient expression of cotransfected c-Jun (Fig. 5 D). This could be nicely explained by the failure of complex formation between c-Jun and Ski when these proteins are coexpressed together with the activated type I receptor (Fig. 5 A). A quantitation of these results indicated that over 60% COS-7 cells displayed prominent nuclear staining of c-Ski upon coexpression of c-Jun, whereas less than 30% exhibited similar staining in the corresponding cells that have been cotransfected with the activated type I receptor (Fig. 5 E). Taken together with our biochemical analysis, these results strongly suggest that Ski interacts with c-Jun and that activation of TGF-β signaling induces Ski to dissociate from c-Jun. We have previously shown that activation of the JNK cascade blocked the ability of Smad2 to mediate TGF-β-dependent transcription (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This observation is based on the ability of the constitutively activated or dominant-interfering forms of MEKK1 and MKK4 to abolish or enhance the TGF-β-dependent activation of the ARE-Lux reporter, respectively. The phosphorylation of Smad2 by the activated type I TGF-β receptor and its subsequent heterodimerization with Smad4 and translocation to the nucleus form the basis for a model of how Smad proteins work to transmit TGF-β signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus (1Massagué J. Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, we observed that activation of JNK does not interfere with any of these signaling events (data not shown). However, we have found that this inhibition takes place in the nucleus and involves a physical interaction between c-Jun and Smad2 (19Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J. Ferrand N. Mazars A. Lallemand F. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine the basis of the inhibitory function of the JNK cascade, we tested whether activation of the JNK cascade might modulate the TGF-β-dependent dissociation of Ski from c-Jun. To test this possibility, HepG2 cells were transfected with FLAG-Ski and HA-c-Jun in the presence or absence of dominant-negative or constitutively activated mutants of MEKK1 and MKK4. In control cells, a strong interaction between Ski and c-Jun could be detected (Fig. 6). However, in cells treated with TGF-β, we observed a decrease in the amount of Ski that coprecipitated with c-Jun, consistent with our previous results (Fig. 5, A–C). Interestingly, in cells coexpressing the constitutively activated mutants of MEKK1 and MKK4, we detected a significant increase in the interaction of c-Jun with Ski even in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 6). Under these experimental conditions, we found that coexpression of the dominant-negative mutants of MEKK1 and MKK4 enhances the ability of TGF-β to induce the dissociation of Ski from c-Jun (Fig. 6). Together, these data suggest that activation of the JNK cascade can stabilize the Ski/c-Jun complexes and that c-Jun may play a critical role in the JNK-dependent repression of Smad2 signaling. The Smad proteins mediate many of the gene responses to TGF-β, and these gene responses differ depending on the cell type and cross-talk between Smad signaling and other signaling systems (1Massagué J. Chen Y.-G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 6Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). For example, the nuclear function of Smad proteins can be limited by c-Jun, a transcriptional factor activated by TGF-β through the JNK pathway (15Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C.

We believed that this antagonistic cross-talk between two signaling pathways activated by TGF-β is very interesting because this mechanism would allow cells to display diverse patterns of transcriptional responses to TGF-β depending upon the relative activation of Smad proteins versus JNK signaling. The findings outlined in the present study provide strong evidence that c-Jun can function by directly associating with the corepressor Ski to stabilize the Smad2/Ski repressor complex. In the absence of TGF-β signaling, constitutive interaction between c-Jun and Ski was detected. However, once signaling has commenced, c-Jun dissociates from Ski, suggesting that this interaction could serve a regulatory purpose either in the suppression of Smad2 that may leak into the nucleus in the basal state or in imposing limits to positive gene responses induced by ligand-activated Smad2. Evidence of both these roles could be proposed in our model because TGF-β is known to induce a delayed and persistent increase in JNK activity (15Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which in turn may increase the interaction of c-Jun and Ski, thereby resetting the Smad2 pathway for interpretation of subsequent TGF-β signals.

In the present study, we examined the effect of Bis VIII on apoptosis induced by DR5 (TRAIL-R2), using an agonistic anti-human DR5 monoclonal antibody, TRA-8. Our results demonstrated that Bis VIII was able to enhance the apoptosis-inducing activity of TRA-8 both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of TRA-8 and Bis VIII led to a synergistic and sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was mediated by MAPK kinase 4 and was caspase-8-dependent. The mitochondrial pathway is involved in the synergistic induction of apoptosis by Bis VIII and TRA-8. Bis VIII alone induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in a caspase-independent fashion without subsequent release of cytochrome c. However, in the presence of Bis VIII, TRA-8 induced more profound loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. These results suggest that the enhanced and persistent activation of the JNK/p38 and the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential play a crucial role in synergistic induction of the death receptor-mediated apoptosis by Bis VIII. The unique ability of Bis VIII to enhance DR5-mediated apoptosis signal transduction discloses a potential utility of this compound in combination with anti-DR5 antibody in cancer therapy.

Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar); MAPK kinase (MKK) 6b, an activator of p38 (20Huang S.

Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which activate JNK and p38 pathways, can also induce caspase activation and cell death.Numerous proapoptotic signal transduction and damage pathways converge on mitochondrial membranes to induce their permeabilization (23Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential are believed to be associated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space together with procaspase-9 and -2 and apoptosis-inducing factor (24Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate cross-talk between three signaling pathways including mitochondrial, JNK/p38 kinase, and caspases. However, the mechanism by which the JNK/p38 and mitochondrial pathways might influence the caspase pathway is still not clear.Recently, we generated a novel agonistic anti-human DR5 monoclonal antibody, TRA-8, which strongly induces apoptosis of most TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo (25Ichikawa K. Liu W. Zhao L. Wang Z. Liu D. Ohtsuka T. Zhang H. Mountz J.D. Koopman W.J. Kimberly R.P. Zhou T. Nat.

Moreover, we have previously shown that bisindolylmaleimide VIII (Bis VIII), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (26Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V.

Lui D. Jope R.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism(s) by which Bis VIII enhances the death receptor-mediated apoptosis is unknown, our study suggest that the apoptosis-enhancing effect of Bis VIII might be associated with signal transduction of death receptor-mediated apoptosis and independent of its protein kinase C inhibition function. In the present study, we examined the effect of Bis VIII on DR5-mediated apoptosis and the signaling mechanisms of DR5-mediated apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that Bis VIII enhances DR5-mediated apoptosis through the JNK/p38 kinase pathway and a mitochondria-dependent pathway.DISCUSSIONMany chemotherapy agents have been shown to be able to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells (42Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Russell E.K. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 734-741PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bonavida B. Ng C.P. Jazirehi A. Schiller G. Mizutani Y. Int. J.

Therefore, the combined apoptosis-inducing molecules with chemotherapy agents have been proposed as a more effective strategy for cancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which chemotherapy agents sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis stimuli are poorly understood. In the present study, we utilized a previously identified leading compound, Bis VIII, and a newly generated novel agonistic anti-human DR5 antibody to examine the molecular signaling mechanisms of DR5-mediated apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that the JNK/p38 kinase plays a central role in the enhancement of DR5-mediated apoptosis with Bis VIII. Although many studies have shown that TRAIL induces activation of JNK/p38 (12Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell.

J. 2000; 348: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the role of activation of JNK/p38 in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is not clear. Our results suggest that in the presence of DR5 signaling, the activation of JNK/p38 controls the process of apoptosis. TRA-8 induced a moderate and caspase-8-dependent activation of the JNK/p38, which was mediated by an upstream kinase, MKK4 (Figs. 3, 4, and 6). The moderate activation of the JNK/p38 was correlated with a weak apoptosis response (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of Bis VIII, the activation of the JNK/p38 induced by TRA-8 was significantly enhanced (Fig. 3). Importantly, Bis VIII was able to enhance the activation of not only JNK/p38 but also caspase-8 (Figs. 2 and 3). These results suggest that there might be a positive feedback between the JNK/p38 and caspase-8, in which the DR5 signaling initiates a weak activation of MKK4/JNK/p38 through caspase-8, and in this event, enhanced activation of JNK/p38 by Bis VIII further leads to activation of caspase-8 and enhancement of apoptosis. MKK4 is likely to be a key upstream kinase responsible for JNK and p38 activation by TRA-8 (Fig.4). Both inhibitor and activator of the JNK/p38 pathway also prove the central role of the JNK/p38 in DR5-mediated apoptosis. The inhibition of MKK4/JNK/p38 activation by curcumin antagonizes both the enhancing effect of Bis VIII on TRA-8-induced caspase activation and cell death, and the activation of the JNK/p38 pathway by anisomycin increases DR5-induced cell death (Fig. 5). Since the JNK/p38 pathway is crucially involved in stress response, it would be reasonable to believe that the stress with radiation or chemotherapy agents would sensitize cancer cells to DR5-mediated apoptosis.Both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways of cell death are involved in cell death induced by a Bis VIII and TRA-8 combination. While TRA-8 transduces a caspase-dependent signal, Bis VIII also transduces an additional caspase-independent signal to facilitate cell death (Fig.6 A). Mitochondria are probably one of the targets of Bis VIII, since treatment of cells with Bis VIII alone resulted in a loss of mitochondria membrane potentials (Fig. 7 A), which was caspase-independent (Fig. 7 B). Whereas loss of mitochondria membrane potential with Bis VIII alone did not induce immediate cell death, it might be able to sensitize the cells to DR5-mediated apoptosis by enhancing utilization of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation (Fig. 7 C). Indeed, the several chemical agents that are able to induce the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, such as carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (47Dispersyn G. Nuydens R. Connors R. Borgers M. Geerts H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) andN,N,-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-indole-3-acetamide (48Pastorino J.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), could enhance DR5-induced cell death by facilitating the caspase activation (data not shown).The signaling association between the JNK/p38 pathway and mitochondrial pathway is still not clear. Given the fact that activation of JNK/p38 after stimulation with TRA-8 or the combination with TRA-8 and Bis VIII (Fig. 3, A and B) occurred before the activation of caspase-9 (Figs. 2 A and 7 C) and release of cytochrome c into cytosol (Fig. 7 C), activated JNK/p38 might be able to regulate the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing pathway through cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 and/or direct activation of mitochondrial death machinery as recently reported (49Aoki H. Kang P.M. Hampe J. Yoshimura K. Noma T. Matsuzaki M. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10244-10250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we propose a model in which a positive interaction between the JNK/p38 pathway and caspase-8 leads to enhanced apoptosis signal transduction. This finding suggests that any stress assaults against cancer cells through the JNK/p38 pathway might be able to enhance the tumoricidal activity of TRA-8 or TRAIL. The identification of the unique property of Bis VIII in enhancement of DR5-mediated apoptosis by targeting both the JNK/p38 pathway and the mitochondrial pathway might be helpful in the design and screening of better chemotherapy drugs to synergize cancer cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF superfamily with strong apoptosis-inducing activity in most tumor cells (1Wiley S.R. Schooley K.

Several receptors for TRAIL in humans have been identified, including DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2), both of which are able to induce cell death, and decoy receptors DcR1 (TRAIL-R3) and DcR2 (TRAIL-R4), as well as osteoprotegerin, which serve as an inhibitor of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (3Pan G.

Similar to TNF-R1 and Fas, DR4 and DR5 contain a death domain in their cytoplasmic region and are able to transduce a death signal in a Fas-associated death domain and caspase-8-dependent fashion (6Chaudhary P.M.

The activation of JNK/p38 through death receptors requires caspase-8, since Fas antibody did not activate JNK and p38 in caspase-8-deficient cells (15Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr.

The caspase inhibitors such asN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) can block activation of JNK and p38 by many apoptotic stimuli (14MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. Dickens M.

Although many studies have shown that TRAIL induces activation of JNK/p38 (12Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 348: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the role of activation of JNK/p38 in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is not clear. Our results suggest that in the presence of DR5 signaling, the activation of JNK/p38 controls the process of apoptosis. TRA-8 induced a moderate and caspase-8-dependent activation of the JNK/p38, which was mediated by an upstream kinase, MKK4 (Figs. 3, 4, and 6). The moderate activation of the JNK/p38 was correlated with a weak apoptosis response (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of Bis VIII, the activation of the JNK/p38 induced by TRA-8 was significantly enhanced (Fig. 3). Importantly, Bis VIII was able to enhance the activation of not only JNK/p38 but also caspase-8 (Figs. 2 and 3). These results suggest that there might be a positive feedback between the JNK/p38 and caspase-8, in which the DR5 signaling initiates a weak activation of MKK4/JNK/p38 through caspase-8, and in this event, enhanced activation of JNK/p38 by Bis VIII further leads to activation of caspase-8 and enhancement of apoptosis. MKK4 is likely to be a key upstream kinase responsible for JNK and p38 activation by TRA-8 (Fig.4). Both inhibitor and activator of the JNK/p38 pathway also prove the central role of the JNK/p38 in DR5-mediated apoptosis. The inhibition of MKK4/JNK/p38 activation by curcumin antagonizes both the enhancing effect of Bis VIII on TRA-8-induced caspase activation and cell death, and the activation of the JNK/p38 pathway by anisomycin increases DR5-induced cell death (Fig. 5). Since the JNK/p38 pathway is crucially involved in stress response, it would be reasonable to believe that the stress with radiation or chemotherapy agents would sensitize cancer cells to DR5-mediated apoptosis. Both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways of cell death are involved in cell death induced by a Bis VIII and TRA-8 combination. While TRA-8 transduces a caspase-dependent signal, Bis VIII also transduces an additional caspase-independent signal to facilitate cell death (Fig.6 A). Mitochondria are probably one of the targets of Bis VIII, since treatment of cells with Bis VIII alone resulted in a loss of mitochondria membrane potentials (Fig. 7 A), which was caspase-independent (Fig. 7 B). Whereas loss of mitochondria membrane potential with Bis VIII alone did not induce immediate cell death, it might be able to sensitize the cells to DR5-mediated apoptosis by enhancing utilization of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation (Fig. 7 C). Indeed, the several chemical agents that are able to induce the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, such as carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (47Dispersyn G. Nuydens R. Connors R. Borgers M. Geerts H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) andN,N,-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-indole-3-acetamide (48Pastorino J.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), could enhance DR5-induced cell death by facilitating the caspase activation (data not shown). The signaling association between the JNK/p38 pathway and mitochondrial pathway is still not clear. Given the fact that activation of JNK/p38 after stimulation with TRA-8 or the combination with TRA-8 and Bis VIII (Fig. 3, A and B) occurred before the activation of caspase-9 (Figs. 2 A and 7 C) and release of cytochrome c into cytosol (Fig. 7 C), activated JNK/p38 might be able to regulate the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing pathway through cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 and/or direct activation of mitochondrial death machinery as recently reported (49Aoki H. Kang P.M. Hampe J. Yoshimura K. Noma T. Matsuzaki M. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10244-10250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we propose a model in which a positive interaction between the JNK/p38 pathway and caspase-8 leads to enhanced apoptosis signal transduction. This finding suggests that any stress assaults against cancer cells through the JNK/p38 pathway might be able to enhance the tumoricidal activity of TRA-8 or TRAIL. The identification of the unique property of Bis VIII in enhancement of DR5-mediated apoptosis by targeting both the JNK/p38 pathway and the mitochondrial pathway might be helpful in the design and screening of better chemotherapy drugs to synergize cancer cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2314948707,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive human disease characterized by UV-sensitivity as well as neurological and developmental abnormalities. Two complementation groups have been established, designated CS-A and CS-B. Traditionally, CSA and CSB have been ascribed a function in the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that efficiently removes bulky lesions from the transcribed strand of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes. To assess the role of the CSB protein in the repair of the highly mutagenic base lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), we have investigated the removal of this lesion using an in vitro incision approach with cell extracts as well as an in vivo approach with a modified protocol of the gene-specific repair assay, which allows the measurement of base lesion repair in intragenomic sequences. Our results demonstrate that the integrity of the CSB protein is pivotal for processes leading to incision at the site of 8-oxoG and that the global genome repair (GGR) of this lesion requires a functional CSB gene product in vivo."

The α-thrombin-mediated activation of Ral in platelets was inhibited by 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate (BAPTA-AM)-mediated depletion of intracellular Ca2+. Ral activation was also stimulated by the thapsigargin- or ionomycin-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+, and the increased level of intracellular Ca2+ was sufficient for RalA activation.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Calcium stimulated the binding of GTP to RalA/RalB and reduced the binding of GDP to RalA in a dose-dependent manner (50Park J. Exp. Mol. Med. 2001; 33: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Calcium may also activate RalA through the binding of calmodulin (CaM) to a region in the C terminus of RalA. Calcium/calmodulin enhanced by a factor of 3 the GTP binding to RalA isolated from CaM-depleted erythrocyte membranes (51Wang K.L. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14525-14528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 53Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As well, endogenous levels of activated GTP-bound RalA were increased by treatment with ionomycin in rat fibroblasts (48Hofer F.R. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 14: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). RalA, but not RalB, contains a putative C-terminal CaM binding domain (BD) that is comprised of basic/hydrophobic residues (amino acids 183–200) and readily forms an amphiphilic helix (53Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments with erythrocyte membrane and recombinant RalA demonstrated that RalA bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (53Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As well, Ca2+/CaM dissociated RalA from synaptic vesicle membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (51Wang K.L. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14525-14528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 54Park J.B. Lee J.Y. Kim J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because excess EGTA inhibited the dissociation of RalA by CaM, it appears Ca2+/CaM can dissociate RalA from membranes regardless of whether GTP or GDP is bound to RalA. The GTPase activity of RalA was also reported to be stimulated by Ca2+/CaM (50Park J. Exp. Mol. Med. 2001; 33: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). There is also the possibility of cross-talk between signal transduction pathways mediated by Ca2+/CaM and Ras proteins (53Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, insulin-like growth factor 1 utilized both the Ras- and Ca2+-mediated pathways for the coordinate regulation of Ral activity (34Suzuki J. Yamazaki Y. Guang L. Kaziro Y. Koide H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4658-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Ral/CaM interaction occurs in a eukaryotic system, and whether RalB binds CaM (the literature to date only refers to in vitro RalA/CaM interactions), we performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay using RalA and RalB as bait to test for interaction with CaM. Results showed that both RalA and RalB interact specifically and directly with CaM in vivo. The speed and degree of positive colony formation suggest that RalA and RalB do not interact identically with CaM. The interaction between the Ral proteins and CaM was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in human platelet lysates and shown to be Ca2+-dependent by in vitro GST and Sepharose fusion protein pull-down experiments with human platelet extracts, and by in vitrobinding assays with recombinant radiolabeled proteins. In addition, experiments using C-terminally deleted RalA demonstrated that RalA may have an additional CaM BD to that identified previously (53Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in the C terminus of RalA. We also show that both RalA and RalB may contain an N-terminal Ca2+-independent and a C-terminal Ca2+-dependent CaM BD and that the C-terminal region of RalB may partially inhibit RalB/CaM interactions. Functionally, we demonstrated that CaM is involved in the thrombin-induced activation of RalA and RalB in human platelets. We propose that the differential binding to CaM by RalA and RalB may be the basis for possible functional differences between the two GTPases. We also propose that CaM regulates the activation state of Ral and that Ral may be a downstream effector of many CaM-regulated pathways. AD202 cells were kindly supplied by Dr. N.

To prepare the RIP1 Ral binding domain (RRBD), pGEX-4T-2[RIP1] was restricted withXhoI and BstBI. The resulting 1661-bp fragment that contained the first 1385 5′ bp of RIP1 was restricted withAflIII. This generated a 299-bp fragment of RIP1, from bp 1087 (AflIII) to 1385 (BstBI), which was filled in with Klenow fragment and ligated into SmaI-restricted and Klenow-blunted pGEX-4T-2, creating the pGEX-4T-2[RBBD] construct. All cDNA inserts were verified to be in the correct orientation by restriction enzyme analysis and to be in-frame by sequence analysis. GST and GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (55Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GST-RRBD was purified from AD202 cells after stimulation with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (55Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparation of the proteins was assessed using SDS-PAGE. Partially purified platelets obtained from the Canadian Blood Services (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) or freshly drawn platelets were gently rocked and treated for 30 min with 0.1 volume of ACD buffer (1.5% citric acid, 2.5% trisodium citrate, 2% glucose) (29Wolthuis R.M.

The platelets were centrifuged at 600 ×g for 15 min to remove any remaining erythrocytes. The supernatant containing the purified platelets was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min, and the platelet pellets were separated from remaining erythrocytes by washing in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1.7 mmMgCl2, 11.9 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose) or buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmglucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EGTA). The platelets were resuspended in 5–10 ml of HEPES/Tyrode buffer and stored at −20 °C or treated immediately with thrombin after resting at room temperature for 30 min to ensure a quiescent state. Purified platelets were suspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer or fractionation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. Proteins were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant containing cytosol was used as the source of endogenous CaM. The cytosol was stored at −80 °C until used in the in vitrobinding studies. The pellet was resuspended in solubilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.55% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants containing solubilized particulate proteins were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. To obtain total platelet lysate, purified platelets were suspended and stirred in buffer containing HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.55% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Total platelet lysate was stored at −80 °C. GST-RalA or GST-RalB (15 μg)-agarose beads were incubated with either 4 μg/ml purified CaM or 2 mg/ml platelet cytosol proteins for 3 h at 4 °C in incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol). Treatment conditions included either buffer alone, 0.2 mm CaCl2, or 5 mm EGTA. In all experiments, GST coupled to GSH-agarose beads was used as control. Following incubation, beads were washed twice using the incubation buffer for each of the treatment conditions and three times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol).

Tetanustoxin inhibited the bFGF-induced glutamate release, revealing that bFGF triggered exocytosis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was required for these acute effects of bFGF.

Many factors including growth factors and the excitatory amino acid glutamate control neuronal functions. In particular, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF,1one of the neurotrophins) plays a fundamental role in neuronal transmission and plasticity (1Berninger B. Poo M.M. Curr. Opin.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also reported that rapid glutamate release was induced by BDNF through the glutamate transporter in cultured cerebellar and cortical neurons (8Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, very little work has been done concerning the roles of other neurotrophic factors in the acute modulation of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system functions (10Wang C.Y. Yang F. He X. Chow A. Du J. Russell J.T. Lu B. Neuron. 2001; 32: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Yang F. Feng L. Zheng F. Johnson S.W. Du J. Shen L. Wu C.P. Lu B. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Initially, bFGF was identified as an angiogenic mitogen, but it is now recognized as a neurotrophic factor. For example, it has been found that bFGF exerts neurotrophic activities in cortical and hippocampal neurons (12Morrison R.S. Sharma A. de Vellis J. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7537-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 13Walicke P. Cowan W.M. Ueno N. Baird A. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3012-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, the expression of bFGF in the central nervous system increases during postnatal development (14Unsicker K. Grothe C. Otto D. Westermann R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), implying that bFGF also has important roles in synaptic maturation. Indeed, bFGF modulates the efficacy of hippocampal synaptic transmission. bFGF enhances the generation of long term potentiation in hippocampal neurons (15Terlau H. Seifelt W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Abe K. Ishiyama J. Saito H. Brain Res. 1992; 593: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that bFGF is involved in glutamatergic transmission, because it is widely accepted that the release of glutamate (presynaptic), as well as the NMDA and the AMPA receptor (postsynaptic), is essential for long term potentiation (17Collingridge G.L. Bliss T.V. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 54-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 18Jia Z. Agopyan N. Miu P. Xiong Z. Henderson J. Gerlai R. Taverna F.A. Velumian A. MacDonald J. Carlen P. Abramow N.W. Roder J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Several reports have indicated that these ionotropic glutamate receptor activities were regulated by bFGF. bFGF regulates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration after activation of the NMDA receptor (19Boxer A.L. Moreno H. Rudy B. Ziff E.B. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 3367-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Long term treatment with bFGF decreases the NMDA receptor-dependent increase in the Ca2+ concentration, and the Ca2+ attenuation is required for the neuroprotective effects in excitotoxic cell death (20Cheng B. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar,21Mattson M.P. Kumar K.N. Wang H. Cheng B. Michaelis E.K. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4575-4588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the glutamate receptor protein is also changed by bFGF. bFGF increased the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 protein but did not alter levels of GluR2/3, GluR4, or the NMDA subunit NR1 (22Cheng B. Furukawa K. O'Keefe J.A. Goodman Y. Kihiko M. Fabian T. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The expression of NMDA receptor protein and calbindin D28 (Ca2+-binding protein) was down-regulated by bFGF (23Peterson D.A. Lucidi-Phillipi C.A. Murphy D.P. Ray J. Gage F.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 886-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that chronic bFGF treatment regulates not only neuronal survival but also postsynaptic plasticity in glutamatergic neurons. However, it is not known what kind of acute effects bFGF exerts on glutamatergic transmission and how bFGF stimulates neuronal transmission. In the present study, we found that bFGF induced glutamate release in cultured cortical neurons. It was revealed that bFGF triggers the release through the exocytotic system in an extracellular Ca2+- and MAPK activation-dependent manner. We propose that not only neurotrophins but also bFGF exerts an acute effect on the excitability of glutamatergic neurons. Primary dissociated cortical cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex of 2- or 3-day-old rats (SLC, Sizuoka, Japan) as reported previously (24Hatanaka H. Tsukui H. Nihonmatsu I. Brain Res. 1988; 467: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 25Numakawa T. Takei N. Yamagishi S. Sakai N. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were gently dissociated with a plastic pipette after digestion with papain (90 units/ml, Worthington) at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were plated at a final density of 4 or 5 × 105/cm2 on polyethyleneimine-coated 12- and 24-well plates (4- and 2-cm2 surface area/well, respectively; Corning). The culture medium consisted of 5% precolostrum newborn calf serum, 5% heated-inactivated horse serum, 1% rat serum, and 89% of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 30 nmNa2SeO3, and 1.9 mg/ml NaHCO3. After maintenance for 6–8 days, the analysis was performed. Hippocampal and cerebellar cells were prepared from 2- to 3-day-old hippocampus and 5-day-old cerebellum, respectively. The procedures for these cultures were the same as for the cortical culture. These cultures were maintained for 9–12 days. Cells were double stained with anti-MAP2 (rabbit IgG; a gift from Dr. H. Murofushi, The University of Tokyo) and anti-c-Fos antibodies (rabbit IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). First, cultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.05% Triton X-100 at room temperature (25 °C) for 20 min and then incubated overnight with anti-MAP2 (1:5000). Secondary antibodies were applied at room temperature for 1 h. To visualize the staining, a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) together with 0.02% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine·4HCl (DAB) dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.01% (v/v) H2O2 was used. Next, cells were incubated with the anti-c-Fos (1:1000) antibody and visualized using DAB together with 0.1% (w/v) (NH4)Ni(SO4)2. The amounts of amino acids released from the cultured neurons were measured as described previously (25Numakawa T. Takei N. Yamagishi S. Sakai N. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amounts released into the assay buffer (modified HEPES-buffered Krebs Ringer solution: KRH containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were measured by HPLC (Shimazu, Kyoto, Japan) with a fluorescence detector (Shimazu). The high K+(HK+) solution consisted of 85 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The Ca2+-free solution was prepared by omitting the CaCl2. Sample fractions were collected every 1 min into tubes on ice by the batch method. They were then filtered with 0.22-μm membranes to remove cell debris. Samples were treated witho-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 12 °C before being injected into the HPLC system and analyzed using a fluorescence monitor (excitation wavelength, 340 nm; emission wavelength, 445 nm). bFGF and BDNF dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1 mg/ml) were added to cultured neurons by bath application. PD98059 (Calbiochem) and U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), MAPK pathway inhibitors, were applied for 40 min at 50 and 10 μm, respectively. LY294002 (Calbiochem), a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, was applied for 30 min at 30 μm. Nifedipine (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, as latoxan, Valence, France) were applied at 10 and 0.5 μm, respectively. Thapsigargin (1 μm) (Research Biochemicals) was added 30 min prior to the application of bFGF. Tetanustoxin (10 nm, List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA) was applied to the culture for 8–12 h before bFGF. l-trans-2,4-PDC (t-PDC) (Research Biochemicals) anddl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (dl-TBOA) (a gift from Suntory Institute for Bioorganic Research, Osaka, Japan) were applied at 10 μm. The glutamate release experiments were performed at least four times with independent cultures to confirm reproducibility. Representative data are shown in the figures. Cells were cultured on polyethyleneimine-coated glasses (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) attached to flexiperm (In Vitro, Kalkberg, Germany). After a wash, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μm Fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in KRH. The dye intensity was monitored using a confocal laser microscope (RCM 8000: Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were irradiated with an excitation blue light beam (488 nm) produced by an argon ion laser. The emitted fluorescence was guided through a ×40 water-immersion objective to a pinhole diaphragm at 520 nm using a diachronic mirror. The intensity of emission was scanned at a dwell time of 1/30 s with a monitor video enhancer and images were obtained every 4 s. The image data were stored in a RCM work station and analyzed. For FM1-43 imaging, the indicator dye (2 μm, Molecular Probes) was loaded into cultured neurons by incubating with HK+ loading solution (KRH containing 50 mm KCl) for 10 min. After several washes, cells were illuminated with an argon ion laser (488 nm). The emission was observed at 520 nm using a diachronic mirror. To perform Na+ imaging, SBFI-AM (10 μm, Molecular Probes), a cell-permeable Na+ indicator, was used. The procedure for the experiment with SBFI-AM was the same as that with Fluo-3-AM. Cultured neurons were irradiated with an excitation ultraviolet beam (351 nm) produced by an argon ion laser, and the fluorescence emitted was guided through the objective to a pinhole diaphragm at 520 nm. Fluorescent dye intensity was normalized to the base line before application of the growth factors. It was confirmed that these dye fluorescence intensities were stable with minimum bleach for more than 5 min in vehicle solution. To confirm reproducibility, all imaging experiments were performed at least four times with independent cultures. Representative data are shown in the figures. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Yamada M. Ohnishi H. Sano S. Nakatani A. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30334-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylarsine oxide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were boiled for 3 min and then clarified by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatants was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and then 10-μg aliquots of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) in 0.1 m Tris base, 0.192 m glycine, and 20% methanol using a semidry electrophoretic transfer system. The membranes were blocked with 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (T-TBS) containing 5% nonfat dried milk at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then probed with antibodies in T-TBS containing 1% nonfat dried milk at room temperature for 1 h. To detect MAPK phosphorylation and protein, anti-phospho-MAPK (1:5000 dilution, New England Biolabs, Inc.) and anti-MAPK (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies were used, respectively. After three washes with T-TBS, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoReserch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1:1000 with T-TBS at room temperature for 1 h. They were then washed at least four times with T-TBS and visualized using the Immunostar (Wako) chemiluminescence system. To determine the acute effect of bFGF on presynaptic function, we examined the bFGF-induced glutamate release in cultured cortical neurons. The time course of the release is shown in Fig.1 A. The release of glutamate was observed immediately after the application of bFGF at 100 ng/ml and was maintained for 1–2 min (panel a in Fig. 1 A). Neurotrophin BDNF-induced release in a sister culture is also shown (panel b in Fig. 1 A). The time course analysis indicated that the bFGF-induced release was similar to the BDNF-induced one in time lapse. HK+ (50 mm KCl)-induced depolarization also evoked the release of glutamate (panel cin Fig. 1 A). Compared with the HK+-evoked release, the bFGF- and BDNF-induced releases tended to be sustained, while the former achieved a much higher level (4–10-fold the growth factor-induced increases). The dose dependence of the bFGF-induced effect was examined (Fig. 1 B). The release of glutamate began at 3 ng/ml and reached a plateau at 10–100 ng/ml. The maximum release was about 250–350% of the basal level in a series of independent cultures. Vehicle solution (BSA, 2 ng/ml) did not have an effect. The maximum levels of bFGF- and BDNF-induced release were almost the same at 100 ng/ml. These results indicated that not only BDNF but also bFGF induces an acute and transient release of glutamate in cultured cortical neurons. Next, we examined whether bFGF stimulates the release of other amino acid neurotransmitters. We found that the effect of bFGF was restricted to glutamate, which is an excitatory neurotransmitter (Fig.1 C). GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, was not induced. Releases of glycine and taurine were not induced by bFGF either (data not shown). HK+, however, evoked the release of not only glutamate but also GABA. These results indicated that bFGF specifically influenced an excitatory amino acid transmitter in cultured cortical neurons. To elucidate the mechanism of the bFGF-induced glutamate release, we focused on the intracellular Ca2+accumulation induced by bFGF, because the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is believed to be an important step in neurotransmitter release. bFGF induced acute increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in cortical neurons (Fig.2). A marked increase was elicited immediately and followed by continuous oscillations (panel ain Fig. 2 B). Some 71–85% of cells in cultures responded to bFGF. The Ca2+ increase was observed in the cell body and neurites (Fig. 2 A). A similar response was observed on application of BDNF (panel b in Fig. 2 B). Approximately 73–82% of cultured cells were BDNF-responsive. Previously, we reported that BDNF induced the release of glutamate in an intracellular Ca2+-dependent manner and that the increase in Ca2+ was mediated by the IP3receptor (which is known to exist on intracellular Ca2+stores) rather than by an influx of extracellular Ca2+ (8Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,9Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the influence of thapsigargin (which induces depletion of Ca2+ from intracellular stores at 10 μm) on the bFGF-stimulated accumulation of Ca2+. Interestingly, although the BDNF-induced Ca2+ increase was inhibited by thapsigargin, the bFGF-induced increase was not affected (panels c andd in Fig. 2 B). Under extracellular Ca2+-free conditions, no Ca2+ increase was induced by bFGF, but it was still observed in response to BDNF (panels e and f in Fig. 2 B). Cd2+ (voltage-dependent Ca2+channel blocker, 100 μm) and TTX (Na+ channel blocker, 0.5 μm) also blocked the bFGF-induced Ca2+ increase (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the increase occurred through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. On the other hand, Cd2+ and TTX did not inhibit the BDNF-stimulated Ca2+ increase (data not shown). Previously, we showed that the intracellular Ca2+concentration was either steady or displayed spontaneous synchronized oscillations (9Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We had identified the growth factor-triggered or spontaneous synchronized oscillations as a synaptic transmission mediated by glutamate. Here we confirmed that the bFGF-induced Ca2+ increases (the first Ca2+ transient) were not affected by glutamate receptor antagonists, APV (10 μm) or CNQX (10 μm), but the subsequent oscillatory Ca2+ activities (synchronized oscillations after the first Ca2+ transient) were abolished. Furthermore, the bFGF-induced increase in the number of c-Fos (one of the immediate early genes)-positive neurons was examined by immunohistochemistry with anti-c-Fos antibody. Both bFGF and BDNF potentiated the number of neurons showing expression of c-Fos (control BSA, 7.93 ± 3.13%; bFGF, 70.5 ± 5.03%; BDNF, 51.55 ± 5.09%, percentages (c-fos/MAP2) of double positive cells, treatments with these factors were performed for 20 min). The induction of c-Fos expression by both these factors was not changed by APV or CNQX, indicating that the induction is triggered directly by bFGF and not through secondary effects such as stimulation by the released glutamate. Therefore, we performed Ca2+ imaging using resting cortical cultures, because the first rapid Ca2+ increase induced by growth factors was easy to clarify. To test whether the bFGF-induced glutamate release is controlled by an exocytotic system, the Ca2+ dependence of the release and the involvement of exocytosis were examined (Fig.3). Under extracellular Ca2+-free conditions, bFGF was not able to induce the release of glutamate (Fig. 3 A). Cd2+ also abolished the bFGF-induced release. In the presence of nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, and TTX, which are expected to block Ca2+ influx through the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, the bFGF-induced release was abolished, suggesting that the bFGF-induced glutamate release was dependent on Ca2+ influx through the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. To further identify the mechanism behind the bFGF-induced release, we tested the effect of tetanustoxin (TeTx, which inhibits synaptic vesicle-dependent release). Pretreatment with TeTx for 8–12 h before the application of bFGF completely inhibited the release of glutamate. Furthermore, the influence of glutamate transporter inhibitors was examined. In the presence of t-PDC (10 μm) and dl-TBOA (10 μm), the bFGF-induced release was not affected (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that it occurred through exocytosis. Furthermore, we examined the acute effects of bFGF on the release of glutamate and accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in cultured hippocampal and cerebellar neurons. These cultured neurons also responded to bFGF (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that bFGF exerted acute effects on central nervous system glutamatergic neurons. By contrast, cultured astroglial cells (95–99% pure judging from immunocytochemistry) exhibited no response to bFGF (glutamate release: basal, 24.5 ± 3.88; bFGF-induced, 26.6 ± 3.52 (×10−10 mol/well), n = 6). All these results suggested that the bFGF induced the release of excitatory transmitters through an extracellular Ca2+-dependent pathway in central nervous system neurons. To further characterize the bFGF-induced release and the involvement of the exocytotic system, we performed an exocytosis assay with the style dye FM1-43 (Fig. 4, A andB). After depolarization-induced FM dye loading, we tested whether bFGF triggers a reduction in the fluorescent intensity of FM. As expected, HK+ and bFGF reduced the intensity (panels a and b in Fig. 4 B). However, the destaining effect of BDNF tended to be weaker than that of bFGF (panels c and d in Fig. 4 B). Vehicle (solution containing BSA) had no effect. Although HK+ also attenuated the intensity of fluorescence, the extent of the destaining by HK+ was less than expected. However, because the number of FM fluorescent buttons, which responded to HK+, seemed to be much larger than that which responded to bFGF, the HK+-evoked glutamate release was thought to be more extensive. The reduction in FM dye by bFGF meant that bFGF likely evoked the depolarization. Thus, we performed an Na+imaging assay using a Na+ indicator SBFI-AM in cultured cortical neurons. Acute application of bFGF induced a significant influx of Na+, suggesting that bFGF acutely evoked cell depolarization (panels a and c in Fig.4 C). BDNF induced an accumulation of Na+ as well (panel c in Fig. 4 C), although the extent of the influx was less than that caused by bFGF. Furthermore, we confirmed that HK+ also induced an influx of Na+, which was 2–3-fold greater than the bFGF-induced one. What kind of intracellular signal pathways are involved in the bFGF-induced glutamate release? First, the effect of genistein, a broad tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on the bFGF-induced release was tested. bFGF did not induce glutamate release after treatment with genistein (1 μm) in cultured cortical neurons (data not shown). Next, we examined the effect of an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway on the bFGF-induced release. MEK (an upstream regulator of MAPK) was required for the survival-promoting effects of bFGF on cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons (27Abe K. Saito H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 122: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). U0126 and PD98059, inhibitors of MEK, completely blocked the bFGF-induced glutamate release (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, BDNF still induced the release in the presence of these MEK inhibitors as reported previously (8Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to confirm that bFGF and BDNF stimulated the activation of MAPK in the cultured cortical neurons, we performed Western blotting using anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. bFGF and BDNF induced phosphorylation of MAPK, although the level of phosphorylation was somewhat lower with bFGF. U0126 and PD98059 markedly attenuated the bFGF-stimulated phosphorylation of MAPK, although the inhibitory effect of U0126 was stronger than that of PD98059. The BDNF-induced phosphorylation of MAPK was also completely blocked by U0126. These results indicated that bFGF and BDNF similarly activate MAPK in cultured cortical neurons. It was therefore revealed that activation of the MAPK pathway is involved in the bFGF-induced, but not BDNF-induced, release of glutamate. Here, we found that bFGF activates MAPK and that the activation is essential for the bFGF-induced glutamate release. As shown in Fig.6 A, interestingly, the phosphorylation level of MAPK gradually increased for at least 20 min after the application of bFGF. The phosphorylation of MAPK began to be observed at 3 min after bFGF exposure. The intensity of phosphorylation then increased, reaching a plateau at 20–40 min. Because the bFGF-induced glutamate release occurred within 1–2 min, the weak but significant MAPK phosphorylation at the early phase (within 3 min) may lead to the glutamate release. On the other hand, there is the possibility that MAPK activation at a later phase (20–40 min after bFGF stimulation) is also involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission. Thus, in addition to the acute effects of bFGF, we examined the effect of pretreatment with bFGF on the HK+-evoked release. Time course analysis showed that treatment with bFGF for 20–60 min enhanced the HK+-evoked release (Fig. 6, B and C), and vehicle (BSA solution) had no effect (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that pretreatment with bFGF potentiated the activity-dependent release. The effects of inhibitors of the MAPK pathway were tested next. Both U0126 and PD98059 (data not shown) completely abolished the bFGF-enhanced release. There are several reports that PI 3-kinase is also activated by bFGF (28Raffioni S. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9121-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8578-8583Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002, 30 μm) had no effect on the HK+-evoked release with or without bFGF treatment (Fig.6 C), excluding the involvement of PI 3-kinase-mediated intracellular signaling systems. These results indicated that the later phase phosphorylation of MAPK is required for the bFGF-potentiated glutamate release. Growth factors play important roles in the regulation of synaptic transmission in central nervous system neurons. Reports have indicated that BDNF and other neurotrophins trigger and modulate synaptic transmission in the acute phase. However, as concerns the effects of bFGF, very little was known. Here, we report an acute effect of bFGF on neurotransmitter release and the underlying intracellular signaling. We found that bFGF induced a rapid and transient glutamate release in cultured cortical neurons. Sequential experiments revealed that exocytosis, which requires an influx of Ca2+ and the activation of the MAPK pathway, is involved in the bFGF-induced release. Furthermore, we found t"

Recently, evidences raised from the phenotype of p73-deficient mice show that an association may exist between the expression of the TP53 homologous gene and HCMV tropism in the brain, suggesting an implication of p73 in viral persistence. In this study, we demonstrated that HCMV-mediated inhibition of apoptosis only occurs in p73-expressing cells. Upon infection, an accumulation of ΔN-p73α isoforms was observed in HCMV-infected p73-positive cells. This phenomenon was shown to be responsible for the subsequent acquired resistance to apoptosis of infected cells. Inhibition of apoptosis in p73-positive cells by HCMV may thus contribute both to virus persistency and abnormal nervous cell survival. This finding provides the first molecular basis for HCMV-associated abnormal embryonic development and neurological defects in newborns.

How morphological and functional disorders develop is unclear since little is known about mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the virus. Apoptosis is an important process participating in the formation of organs and tissues during embryogenesis and in the clearance of abnormal or misfunctioning cells in the body. At any stages of life, interference with this process is predicted to be damaging for organisms. In the mouse developing brain, surprisingly, murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) was found to induce apoptosis in non-infected cells, whereas a blocking of apoptosis occurred in infected mature neurons (3Kosugi I. Shinmura Y. Li R.Y. Aiba-Masago S. Baba S. Miura K. Tsutsui Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with human neuroblastoma cells, which become “immortalized” and resistant to cytotoxic stress following HCMV infection (4Cinatl Jr., J. Cinatl J. Vogel J.U. Kotchetkov R. Driever P.H. Kabickova H. Kornhuber B. Schwabe D. Doerr H.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 367-372PubMed Google Scholar). As with many other viruses, HCMV has developed strategies to inhibit apoptosis of infected cells, thus escaping from immune clearance, promoting abnormal cell survival, and favoring viral persistence. Some reports discuss possible mechanisms by which HCMV can block apoptosis. HCMV proteins can directly interact with the tumor suppressor p53 and interfere with either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (5Jault F.M. Jault J.M. Ruchti F. Fortunato E.A. Clark C. Corbeil J.

Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang J. Belcher J.D. Marker P.H. Wilcken D.E. Vercellotti G.M. Wang X.L. J. Mol.

A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In addition to p53 inactivation, HCMV can block apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 (Flice) (14Skaletskaya A. Bartle L.M. Chittenden T. McCormick A.L. Mocarski E.S. Goldmacher V.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) or by mimicking the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 (15Goldmacher V.S. Bartle L.M. Skaletskaya A. Dionne C.A. Kedersha N.L.

A. 1999; 96: 12536-12541Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). As pointed out above, HCMV antiapoptotic activities may account for virus persistency and pathogenicity. Recently, a p53 homologue termed p73 was described (16Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), and evidence was raised from the phenotype of p73-deficient mice that p73-expressing cells such as Cajal-Retzius cells, vomeronasal organ neurosensory neurons, (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), and sympathetic neuroblasts (18Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) were lost in the mutant. These observations suggested that functional p73 was required for neuron survival. The degree of overlaps between cytomegalovirus tissue tropism and p73-positive cell distribution in brain, as noticed early on, suggested a link between viral persistence and p73 gene products. The discovery of p73 dominant negative isoforms thus prompted us to assess a possible relationship between HCMV antiapoptotic activities and p73 expression in infected cells. We hypothesized that one mechanism by which the virus may protect cells against apoptosis was by up-regulating endogenous inhibitors of p53 and p73 such as ΔN-p73. Our results demonstrate (i) that the blockage of apoptosis by HCMV relies on p73 expression, (ii) that HCMV, indeed, induces a robust stabilization of ΔN-p73 protein and not of p73, and (iii) finally, that the up-regulation of ΔN-p73 is per se sufficient to inhibit the apoptotic process. IMR-32 and SK-N-AS neuroblastoma and U373MG astrocytoma cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). IMR-32 and SK-N-AS were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and U373MG in RPMI medium (Invitrogen), both containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and supplemented with 10 μg/ml Oflocet anti-mycoplasma (Roussel, Paris, France) and sodium pyruvate unless otherwise stated. Transcript sequences and protein expression of p73 and p53 have been described in Ref. 16Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X.

HCMV AD169 (ATCC) was propagated in human foreskin fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Virus was collected when cytopathic effects were >90%. Supernatants were clarified of cell debris by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and were stored at −70 °C until use. Virus titers were determined by plaque-forming unit titration in human foreskin fibroblasts according to standard procedures. A multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 3 was used for all the experiments. Type 5 adenovirus recombinant for p73α (Ad-p73α) or ΔN-p73α (Ad-ΔN-p73α) were obtained as follows: Ad-p73α was produced by homologous recombination in 293 cells after co-transfection of the linearized plasmid containing the left adenovirus inverted terminal repeat, p73α, or ΔN-p73α cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter, the pIX sequence of adenovirus, and the DNA of d1324 digested with the restriction enzyme ClaI. β-Galactosidase recombinant virus (Ad-β-galactosidase) was prepared as described (19Abina M.A. Tulliez M. Lacout C. Debili N. Villeval J.L. Pflumio F. Wendling F. Vainchenker W. Haddada H. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Viruses were purified by cesium-chloride centrifugation, aliquoted in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C until use. The presence of p73 sequences was tested by restriction enzyme digestion and by sequencing the viral DNA. Optimal m.o.i. to obtain cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses was determined by using Ad-β-galactosidase and blue staining as follows: cells were seeded into a 25-cm2 flask and infected with Ad-β-galactosidase as described above at various m.o.i. values. Virus was removed after 3 h, and cells were incubated for a further 48 h. After three washes in PBS, cells were fixed for 5 min in 0.4% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde, washed, and incubated at room temperature overnight with PBS containing 4 mm potassium ferricyanure, 0.8 mg/ml X-gal, and 5 mm MgCl2. Cells were washed and then examined under a light microscope. Adenoviruses were used at 50 m.o.i. in serum-free medium. Virus was removed after 4 h, and cells were incubated in normal medium for a further 20 h. U373MG, SK-N-AS, or IMR-32 cells were cultured in six-well culture plates in their respective medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with sodium pyruvate and Oflocet, as described above. Cells were either mock-infected or infected with HCMV AD169 as indicated or with adenoviruses (Ad-β-galactosidase, Ad-p73α, or Ad-ΔN-p73α) during 24 h. Cisplatin (Sigma) at 250 μm final concentration was added to cell culture and incubation continued at 37 °C for a further 48 h. IMR-32 cells were treated with actinomycin D (Sigma) at a 2 nm final concentration for 15 h. After incubation at 37 °C in the above conditions, cells were washed with PBS and detached with trypsin. Cell death was detected by counting the trypan blue- (Invitrogen) colored cells. The percentage of dead cells was calculated as follows: ((number of colored dead cells/number of total cells) × 100). The presence of apoptotic cells was also detected by multiparameter flow cytometry (Coulter Epics) using propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Coulter-Immunotech) double labeling according to the manufacturer's instructions and by Western blotting of PARP cleavage as described below. At different times post-infection, monolayers of U373MG, IMR-32, or SK-N-AS cells were harvested, washed, and either stocked at −20 °C or immediately lysed by incubation for 5 min on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8). Lysates were homogenized with a pipette and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm. Supernatants were collected, and total proteins were quantified using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 30 μg of proteins were boiled for 5 min in 5% β-mercaptoethanol reducing Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were stained with Ponceau red to visualize total proteins contained in each slot and probed alternatively with the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-human p73α (16Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

Mazeron, Paris, France) at 1:10 dilution; PARP mouse monoclonal antibody (1:10,000 dilution, CLONTECH laboratories); or a human p21 (Cip1/WAF1) mouse monoclonal antibody (1: 500 dilution, BD Transduction Laboratories). Blots were revealed using peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilution, BD Transduction Laboratories) or peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000 dilution, Sigma) and ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted from mock- and HCMV-infected cells using the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription using the Superscript preamplification system kit (Invitrogen) with 3 μg of total RNA. PCR amplification was carried out using the following primer pairs: p73α sense (exon 1), 5′AGGGGACGCAGCGAAACC-3′; p73α antisense (exon 10), 5′-CCATCAGCTCCAGGCTCTC-3′; ΔN-p73α sense (exon 3′), 5′-ACAAACGGCCCGCATGTTC-3′; ΔN-p73α antisense (exon 10), 5′-CCATCAGCTCCAGGCTCTC-3′, with 33 cycles. Coamplification of GAPDH was used as an internal control. U373MG cells were seeded on Labtek chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Cells were fixed for 1 h in PBS containing formaldehyde (3.7% final), washed in PBS, and then permeabilized in methanol/acetone (1:1) at −20 °C for 5 min. After washing with PBS, slides were saturated with PBS containing BSA (1%) and goat serum (1/20) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then probed with rabbit anti-p73α antiserum (1/100 in 1% PBS-BSA) overnight at 4 °C. After two washes in PBS, slides were incubated in rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 (1/100 in PBS-BSA) for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark. Slides were washed three times in PBS, washed once in distilled water, and mounted in Faramount (DAKO) for examination on a Leitz fluorescent microscope. For intracellular staining of HCMV pp65, cells were incubated with HCMV (m.o.i. of 3) and then processed as follows. After fixation for 10 min in PBS containing 2% saccharose and 5% formaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with 10% saccharose, Nonidet P-40 0.5%, and fetal calf serum 1% in PBS for 5 min, washed, and incubated (30 min, 37 °C) with mouse monoclonal antibody directed against pp65 (Cinapool diluted 1/20, Argene Biosoft, Varilhes, France). Cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with a 1/200 dilution of a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Coulter-Immunotech) for 30 min. Slides were washed three times again, mounted, and examined on a Leitz fluorescent microscope. It has been well established that cisplatin exerts its cytotoxic effect through induction of DNA damage and activation of apoptosis, both involving p53 or p73 proteins (21Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to cisplatin has been determined in HCMV-permissive U373MG astrocytoma cells that have been selected as they express wild-type p73 (p73+) and mutated p53 (p53−) (16Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that treatment with cisplatin for 48 h resulted in cell death, as assessed through trypan blue exclusion, but that cells became resistant following infection by HCMV (Fig. 1 a). It is noteworthy that the ratio of infected to uninfected dead cells within cisplatin-treated cells increased dramatically from day 0 (40 versus 60%) to day 2 (75versus 50%) and day 3 (100 versus 30%), suggesting that HCMV-induced antiapoptotic process was more efficient as infection progressed. Apoptosis was observed by using Western blotting of PARP cleavage (Fig. 1 b) and annexin V/propidium iodide double labeling (Fig. 1 c), suggesting that in U373MG cells, p73 contributed to cisplatin-induced programmed cell death. In contrast, infected cells (at 48–72 h post-infection (p.i.)) became resistant to apoptosis (Fig. 1, b and c). Microscopic analysis of anti-p73-labeled U373MG showed a nuclear staining in cisplatin-treated cells, contrary to the untreated ones (Fig. 1 d). This reflected an expression of p73 that could be correlated with acquisition of cisplatin sensitivity, as demonstrated previously in HCT116–3 cells (21Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). HCMV-mediated resistance to cisplatin was not due to the absence of p73 expression since infected cells were still labeled with anti-p73 (Fig. 1 d). Furthermore, HCMV alone did not sensitize cells to apoptosis (Fig. 1,a–c), albeit infected cells expressed p73 (Fig.1 d), suggesting that proapoptotic functions of p73 could be inhibited following infection. To assess whether HCMV-induced resistance to cisplatin was restricted to cells expressing p73, we infected SK-N-AS cells that are known to express wild-type p53 and no detectable p73 (16Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Firstly, we ensured that most cells were infected through immunostaining using antibody directed against the matrix protein pp65. Microscopic examination of infected cells showed characteristic cytomegaly in most cells and revealed that they were pp65-positive (data not shown). Furthermore, Western blotting with antibodies directed against IE proteins demonstrated that neosynthesis of viral proteins occurred in these cells (Fig. 2 a). Then, SK-N-AS cells were either mock-infected or infected with HCMV and further submitted to cisplatin treatment for 48 h. Contrary to U373MG, SK-N-AS were still sensitive to cisplatin after 3 days (d3) of infection with HCMV, as assessed by trypan blue staining and Western blotting of PARP cleavage (Fig. 2, band c). These data suggest that resistance of HCMV-infected cells to cisplatin requires p73 gene activity. Microscopic analysis of cisplatin-treated U373MG cells that have been infected with HCMV showed a preserved staining with anti-p73 antibodies (Fig. 1 d), suggesting that inhibition of apoptosis could not be ascribed to the absence of p73 expression. In mice, multiple isoforms of p73 have been described, resulting from either splicing events or alternative promoter usage (20Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Sabatini S. Gong J. Wang J.Y.J. Melino G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ΔN isoforms lacking a functional transactivation domain have been described in mouse as well as in human that exert an inhibitory effect on p73 and p53 transactivating activities and p53-dependent apoptosis (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 18Pozniak C.D.

Hugli B. Graber H.U. De Laurenzi V. Fey M.F. Melino G. Tobler A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To assess whether suppression of apoptosis in HCMV-infected U373MG cells could involve ΔN isoforms, we first analyzed p73 expression by Western blotting. Cells were infected for times ranging from 0.5 h to 72 h and lysed, and protein extracts were submitted to SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-p73 rabbit antibodies. Fig. 3 a shows that throughout infection with HCMV, two bands were revealed corresponding to full-length p73α and to a truncated p73 isoform. Since rabbit antibodies do not recognize C-terminal truncated isoforms (data not shown), we conclude that the truncated p73 product corresponded to a ΔN-p73α protein. Moreover, the truncated protein comigrated with the product of a ΔN-p73α adenovirus containing a cDNA of p73α from using an alternate promoter (Fig. 3 a) as described (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 23Grob T.J. Novak U. Maisse C.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and U373MG cells neither expressed transcripts lacking exon 2 constitutively (16Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) nor following infection by HCMV (data not shown). It is noticeable that HCMV induced steady state levels of p73α, and surprisingly, that the level of ΔN-p73α expression dramatically increased during the course of infection. To determine whether overexpression of ΔN-p73α reflected an increase in gene transcription as compared with that of p73α, reverse transcription-PCR analyses were performed with specific primers. Fig.3 b shows that mRNAs encoding both truncated and full-length p73α were expressed at similar levels and at the same ratio throughout infection with HCMV, suggesting that stabilization of the ΔN-p73α protein rather than increased transcription of the gene could account for its overexpression. Accordingly, we deduce that anti-p73 labeling in HCMV-infected cells in Fig. 1 d mainly reflected the expression of the ΔN-p73α isoform. To determine whether human ΔN-p73α could exhibit an inhibitory activity on cisplatin-induced apoptosis in U373MG and SK-N-AS, cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing p73α or ΔN-p73α. Two days after infection, cells were exposed to cisplatin for 48 h, and apoptosis was determined by Western blotting of PARP cleavage. Both cell lines were sensitive to cisplatin following infection with a control adenovirus (Fig. 4, Ad-β-galactosidase) even at a higher extent in SK-N-AS than in U373MG cells, as observed above in Fig. 2. Control adenovirus alone had no effect on cell survival, but ectopic expression of p73α induced apoptosis in both cell lines (Fig. 4, Ad-p73α). Upon combination of Ad-p73α infection and cisplatin treatment, no cell survival was observed, suggesting that under the overproduction of p73α, completion of apoptotic activity required an additional signal. Infection with Ad-ΔN-p73α rescued both cell lines from cisplatin-induced cell death, demonstrating that the truncated isoform exerted a dominant negative activity on both p73- and p53-dependent apoptosis. To demonstrate that HCMV-induced stabilization of ΔN-p73α was responsible for the resistance of infected cells to p53-dependent apoptosis, a neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 that expresses both functional p73 and p53 proteins was used. Previous studies demonstrated that following exposure of IMR-32 to actinomycin D (ActD) at concentrations that induce DNA damage, p73 was not activated contrary to p53 (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of HCMV infection on apoptosis of IMR-32, cells were infected with HCMV and treated with ActD. Ensured that IMR-32 supported HCMV infection (Fig.5 a) and that most cells were infected, p73 protein expression was assayed by Western blotting. Fig.5 b shows that infection with HCMV induced an overexpression of ΔN-p73α in IMR-32 that started early (at 4 h p.i.) after virus inoculation. Then, sensitivity to apoptosis was analyzed by Western blotting of PARP cleavage. As expected, no cleavage of PARP was observed in uninfected and untreated cells. In cells that have been treated with ActD, full-length PARP was no longer recovered, reflecting apoptosis of all the cells. Following infection by HCMV, apoptosis was observed as revealed by the appearance of the 83-kDa cleavage product of PARP, which could reflect the cytopathic effect of the virus on IMR-32. In contrast, when cells were infected with HCMV prior to treatment with ActD, full-length PARP was recovered at a similar extent to that observed in infected cells, suggesting that HCMV infection rendered IMR-32 cells resistant to ActD (Fig. 5 c). Conclusively, as shown above for cisplatin-treated U373MG cells, HCMV infection rendered IMR-32 cells resistant to ActD-induced apoptosis. Since in IMR-32 actinomycin D triggers p53 transcriptional activity (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), we asked whether HCMV infection could disrupt activation of the p53-responsive gene p21. As expected, exposure of uninfected cells to ActD induced a high level of p21 protein expression (Fig.5 d). Conversely, ActD treatment failed to induce p21 expression in HCMV-infected cells, suggesting that overexpression of ΔN-p73α could be responsible for the inhibition of p53-dependent transactivation (Fig. 5 d). Collectively, our results demonstrate that HCMV infection blocked p73 and p53 apoptosis in infected cells through overexpression of ΔN-p73α. Cell death is an important mechanism that determines the size and shape of the vertebrate nervous system. Converging evidences stress that neuronal death is a p53-dependent process and that multiple factors modulate cellular competence to die (24Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Many viruses are capable of inhibiting p53 either through direct interactions between viral proteins and p53 or by interfering with cellular controls of p53 activity. As a result, an abnormal cell survival and a viral persistence are observed (25Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCMV is postulated to have developed various strategies to block apoptosis (14Skaletskaya A. Bartle L.M. Chittenden T. McCormick A.L. Mocarski E.S. Goldmacher V.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Goldmacher V.S. Bartle L.M. Skaletskaya A. Dionne C.A. Kedersha N.L. Vater C.A. Han J.W. Lutz R.J. Watanabe S.

Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggested a yet uncovered mechanism for HCMV-mediated antiapoptotic activity that may involve a cellular up-regulation of ΔNp73, a negative regulator of p53 (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). p73-deficient sympathetic neuroblasts are highly susceptible to p53-mediated apoptosis (18Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In contrast, HCMV-infected neuroblasts are almost totally resistant to stress-induced apoptosis (4Cinatl Jr., J. Cinatl J. Vogel J.U. Kotchetkov R. Driever P.H. Kabickova H. Kornhuber B. Schwabe D. Doerr H.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 367-372PubMed Google Scholar), raising the assumption that HCMV-induced resistance to apoptosis might be a p73-dependent process. To address this question, various human cell lines expressing either functional p53 or p73α or both were used, and p73 expression status and resistance to stress-induced apoptosis before and after HCMV infection were evaluated in these cells. It was found that (i) only p73-expressing cells developed resistance to apoptosis after infection, (ii) resistance to cell death was associated with an accumulation of ΔN-p73α isoforms, and (iii) ectopic expression of ΔNp73 isoforms in p73-deficient cells is per se sufficient to confer resistance to apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrated that ΔN-p73α accumulation resulted from protein stabilization rather than in an increased level of synthesis. The first cellular event observed after cell infection is the disruption of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (26Ahn J.H. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4599-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), structures implicated in the proteasomal-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (27Mattsson K. Pokrovskaja K. Kiss C. Klein G. Szekely L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, various proteins have been shown to accumulate in HCMV-infected cells (5Jault F.M. Jault J.M. Ruchti F. Fortunato E.A. Clark C. Corbeil J. Richman D.D. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6697-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fortunato E.A. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2033-2039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p73α and ΔN-p73α isoforms are both sensitive to proteasome degradation (28Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,29Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in HCMV-infected cells, ΔN-p73α was found to accumulate much more than p73α, which could be explained by the distinct cellular distribution of the two isoforms (29Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Finally, it can be concluded that HCMV infection induces resistance to apoptosis through an up-regulation of ΔN-p73α. It is noteworthy that ectopically expressed ΔN-p73α is per se sufficient for p73-deficient cells to become resistant to p53-dependent apoptosis. The fact that ΔN-p73α expression is required prior to infection to ensure resistance to cell death identifies ΔN-p73α as a host factor involved in viral latency and persistence. Importantly, in mouse brain, ΔN-p73α transcripts have been reported to be the predominant TP73 products (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and thus, ΔN-p73α is the major isoform expressed (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 18Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Expression of ΔN-p73α transcripts is controlled by a P3 promoter located into the large intron 3 of TP73 (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). A recent study has suggested that in vitro, P3 may be regulated by p53 (23Grob T.J. Novak U. Maisse C. Barcaroli D. Luthi A.U. Pirnia F. Hugli B. Graber H.U. De Laurenzi V. Fey M.F. Melino G. Tobler A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In fact, strong evidences point out p73 itself as the factor controlling P3 activity in vivo: (i) distributions of p73α and ΔN-p73α transcripts are strictly overlapping in brain, although their relative concentration is variable (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar); (ii) p53-deficient mice normally express p73α and ΔN-p73α transcripts; and (iii) in vitro, p73 can also efficiently transactivate P3 promoter (data not shown). It is therefore suggested here that one of the main functions of TP73 could be the production of a dominant negative p53 activity, ensuring neuronal survival. Intriguingly, since ΔN-p73 also inhibits p73 transactivation (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), it is likely that the regulation of ΔN-p73α activity is mainly a post-transcriptional process, supposedly controlling protein stability. It can be speculated that any interference with ΔN-p73α regulation will have implications in development and oncogenesis. For instance, virus-mediated ΔN-p73α accumulation can be predicted to immortalize Cajal-Retzius cells and to induce abnormal cortical migration with subsequent lissencephaly and/or epilepsy-like syndromes. In developing mice, indeed, mCMV was found to alter cortical neuronal migration (30Shinmura Y. Aiba-Masago S. Kosugi I. Li R.Y. Baba S. Tsutsui Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1331-1340PubMed Google Scholar), and in humans, epilepsy and disorders of cortical development in children with HCMV congenital infection have been described (31Perez-Jiminez A. Colamaria V. Franco A. Grimau-Merino R. Darra R. Fontana E. Zullini E. Beltramello O. Dalla-Bernardina B. Rev. Neurol. (Paris). 1998; 26: 42-49Google Scholar). On the other hand, by the induction of drug resistance and alteration of programmed cell death, cytomegalovirus infection may be implicated in the etiology and/or progression of malignancies such as neuroblastoma (4Cinatl Jr., J.

Dominici C. Krzysztofiak A. Castello M. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 1995; 24: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More generally, we hypothesize that all the viruses of the β-herpes family known to induce the inhibition of apoptosis, such as herpes simplex virus type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, and CMV, share the same capacity of up-regulating either ΔN-p73α or the other homologous protein ΔN-p63α (33Yang A.

Haddada (INSERM 462, Villejuif, France) for recombinant adenovirus design."
https://openalex.org/W1977621221,"Analysis of the role of specific protein kinases in signal transduction networks has relied heavily on ATP analog inhibitors. Currently used agents, however, often do not distinguish between kinase family members. Genetic approaches can also be used to inactivate a specific kinase, but these techniques do not afford the rapid kinetics possible with pharmacological inhibitors. To circumvent this problem, modification of the structure of a particular protein kinase can be performed to engineer a drug-target interaction of choice. We have used this method to create protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunits with modifications that confer sensitivity to novel ATP analog inhibitors. Mutation of methionine 120 to alanine or glycine in either the Calpha or Cbeta subunits of PKA induces sensitivity to a series of C-3 derivatized pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based inhibitors. Modification of threonine 183 enhances this inhibitor sensitivity. The IC(50) values in cell culture of the most broadly effective agent, 1-NM, ranged from 25 to 200 nm depending upon the combination of modified amino acids and were significantly higher than the potencies observed with H-89. Despite their high sequence conservation, Cbeta enzymes with inhibitor-sensitive amino acids at position 120 showed a substantial loss of overall catalytic activity when used to induce reporter gene transcription in transfected cells. Conversion of position 46 (lysine to isoleucine) rescued the ability of position 120 mutated Cbeta enzymes to induce gene transcription. Application of this combined genetic and pharmacological approach should allow analysis of the specific roles of PKA isoforms in cell culture and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2333800968,"Low level expression of an active Raf kinase results in a transformed phenotype; however, high intensity Raf signals block cell cycle progression. Phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in regulating cell cycle progression and PLD activity is elevated in Raf transformed cells. We report here that high intensity Raf signals reduce PLD activity and that elevated expression of either PLD1 or PLD2 prevents cell cycle arrest induced by high intensity Raf signals. Overexpression of either PLD1 or PLD2 also reversed increases in p21(Cip1) and protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) cleavage seen with high intensity Raf signals. These data indicate that PLD signaling provides a novel survival signal that overcomes cell cycle arrest induced by high intensity Raf signaling."

Association of Ran·GTP with transport carriers (karyopherins) triggers the loading/unloading of export or import cargo, respectively.

To monitor tail orientation, a Ran-GFP fusion was labeled with the fluorophore Alexa546.

Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This huge traffic flows through about 3,000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that are plugged into the double membrane that encompasses the nucleus (2Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 3Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 4Nakielny S.

The Ran GTPase controls the overall vectoriality of much of this traffic. Ran·GDP is converted to the GTP-bound state by an exchange factor, RanGEF (also called RCC1), which is localized in the nucleus and binds to histones. Ran·GTP is converted back to the GDP-bound form by a GTPase-activating protein, RanGAP, which is localized to the cytoplasm and NPCs. The asymmetric distribution of these factors generates a steep Ran·GTP gradient across the nuclear pores. Soluble transport carriers (karyopherins) recognize and bind to specific signal sequences in cargo destined for translocation through the pores. The carriers can interact with nucleoporins (proteins that compose the nuclear pore complex) and move through the pores by a process of facilitated diffusion. The function of Ran·GTP in nucleocytoplasmic transport is to disassemble import complexes in the nucleus by displacing cargo from the importin carrier and to drive assembly of export complexes by co-operatively binding to the exportin carrier together with cargo. For both importins and exportins, a carrier-Ran·GTP complex is ultimately delivered to the cytoplasm, where RanGAP, in co-operation with a factor called Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1),1 triggers hydrolysis of the GTP and release of Ran·GDP from the carrier. The Ran·GDP then cycles back into the nucleus as a complex with another factor called NTF2, where the RanGEF catalyzes nucleotide exchange to generate Ran·GTP, which dissociates from the NTF2 to complete the cycle (2Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 3Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Ran·GDP has an extremely low affinity for the cargo carriers and so is not re-imported in association with them (6Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nor does Ran·GDP detectably associate with RanBP1. Nonetheless, a stable ternary complex can be formed in vitro between Ran·GDP, importin-β, and RanBP1 (6Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6818-6822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The function of this complex in nucleocytoplasmic transport, if any, remains unknown. As an added complexity, there are cofactors that participate in the transport complexes. RanBP3, for example, associates with the exportin Crm1 and increases the affinity of the carrier for both Ran·GTP and for export cargo (8Lindsay M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Englmeier L. Fornerod M. Bischoff F.R. Petosa C. Mattaj I.W. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 926-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar cofactors may exist for importins. Our understanding of the mechanics and regulation of this Ran-dependent transport cycle requires structural knowledge of all the factors that interact with Ran and knowledge of the dynamics that govern their interactions. A number of crystal structures have been solved: (i) Ran·GDP alone and in a complex with nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) and (ii) Ran in the GTP-bound conformation in complexes with a Ran binding domain (RanBD) of RanBP2, importin-β, and karyopherinβ2 (10Scheffzek K. Klebe C. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 374: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A.

Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These structures show that the orientation of the C-terminal tail of Ran is profoundly altered by complex formation with the RanBD or the transport carriers. Why does the C terminus of Ran move? Although the structure of uncomplexed Ran·GTP has not been solved, experiments using antibodies against the acidic C-terminal tail suggest that the tail is tethered to the body of the protein but is released when Ran·GTP binds importin-β (15Hieda M. Tachibana T. Yokoya F. Kose S. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Release of the tail is predicted to facilitate RanBP1 binding, because the tail wraps around and enfolds the RanBD (16Villa Braslavsky C.I. Nowak C. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Kuhlmann J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This increased on-rate may increase the efficiency of GTP hydrolysis by RanGAP. However, there have been no direct tests of this model, and the orientation of the C-terminal tail is not known for free Ran·GTP, nor for Ran·GTP bound in a complex with exportins such as Crm1, nor for the ternary complex of Ran· GDP-importin-β-RanBP1. As an approach to address these issues, we created a sensor for the C-terminal tail conformation of Ran, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (17Clegg R.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The sensor consists of a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C terminus of Ran, coupled with chemical modification to provide a FRET acceptor on Cys-112 of Ran. This sensor shows high FRET efficiency in the GDP-bound state and low FRET efficiency when bound to RanBP1 or importin-β, consistent with the known changes in orientation of the tail. We have used this sensor to demonstrate that the C terminus does not re-orient when Ran is converted to the GTP-bound state but does move away from the body of the protein in complexes of Ran·GDP with RanBP1 and importin-β, or of Ran·GTP with Crm1 and export cargo. A second, two-component, FRET sensor was created to visualize complexed Ran and RanBP1 in vivo and consists of Ran labeled with Alexa546 and RanBP1 fused to the C terminus of GFP. When injected into cells, this bipartite sensor displays a cytoplasmic FRET signal consistent with the presence of a ternary Ran·GDP-RanBP1-importin complex. These data provide the first evidence for such a complex in intact cells and suggest that current models of nuclear transport will need to be adjusted to account for its existence. The gene encoding GFP was cloned into theBamHI/BglII sites of the pQE60 plasmid (Qiagen), which adds a His6 tag at the C terminus of GFP. The Ran open reading frame was cloned into the BamHI site of pQE60-GFP so as to express a Ran-GFP-His6 fusion protein. Recombinant His6-tagged Ran, GFP, and Ran-GFP were expressed in Escherichia coli (strain M15) at 18 °C and affinity-purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen). The proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Ran-GFP was buffer-exchanged into 10 mmNa3PO4, pH 7.2, 70 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and was purified by FPLC on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Ran and Ran-GFP were then labeled with a 2.5 molar excess of Alexa546-maleimide (Molecular Probes) on ice for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and unincorporated label was removed by size-exclusion on a Centrisep spin-column (Princeton Separations). The purified and labeled Ran-GFP-Alexa546 (RGA) and Ran-Alexa546 (RA) were converted to the GDP-bound state by treatment with 0.4 μg of RanGAP + 2 mmGDP or converted to the GTP-bound state by treatment with 3.0 μg of RanGEF + 2 mm GTP at 30 °C for 20 min. Recombinant importin-β, NTF2, RanBP1 RBD, GST-GFP-RanBP1, Crm1, and RanBP3 were made as previously described (18Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr.

Alexa546-labeled or GFP-tagged proteins were diluted to 50 and 100 nm, respectively in 10 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.2, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and their emission spectra were analyzed on a Spex Fluorolog instrument controlled by Datamax software. The donor fluorophore, GFP, was excited at 467 nm with an integration time of 0.2 s, and the emission spectra of both donor and acceptor were visualized from 490 to 600 nm. The slit width was 2 nm. Additional proteins were added to the cuvette and incubated for 5–20 min before rescanning. Relative FRET efficiencies were described by the ratio FGA/FGG, where FGA is the fluorescence emission peak of the acceptor (Alexa546) when excited at the donor (GFP) wavelength (467 nm) and FGG is the emission peak of the GFP donor when excited at 467 nm. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 or tsBN2) were plated onto chambered cover slips (Nunc) 24 h prior to injection. The tsBN2 cells, which possess a thermally labile allele of RanGEF (23Uchida S. Sekiguchi T. Nishitani H. Miyauchi K. Ohtsubo M. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), were grown at either 33.5 °C (permissive temperature) or shifted to 39.5 °C (nonpermissive temperature) in the presence of 35.5 μmcycloheximide for 3 h prior to microinjection. Proteins were diluted to 25 μm in microinjection buffer (10 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.2, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2), centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and injected into the cytoplasm of about 50 cells. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C (33.5 or 39.5 °C for tsBN2) for 30 min to allow injected proteins to equilibrate. Microinjected cells were visualized on a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope with a ×60 water immersion lens (n.a. = 1.2). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera controlled by Openlab 3.0.1 software. Signals were visualized using the following Chroma filter/dichroic sets: FGG–S460/20×, S500/22M, 475DCLP; FAA–S555/28×, S617/73M, 475DCLP; and FGA–S460/20×, S617/73M, 475DCLP (where FAA = fluorescence emission of Alexa546 with direct excitation of the dye at its absorption peak). Direct excitation of the Alexa546 fluorophore, and bleed-through fluorescence from GFP using the FGAfilter set, were calculated from control injections and subtracted from the FGA images using the Image Calculator and Math functions of ImageJ software. The resulting FRET images were then colorized using the Fire LUT of ImageJ. To calculate predicted FRET signals in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell, fractional concentrations for each Ran species, computed using the steady-state Virtual Cell model (1Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), were multiplied by the measured FGA/FGG ratios for each species from the in vitro fluorometric assays. The products, which represent the relative FRET efficiencies, were then summed for each compartment to give the overall fractional Ran concentrations and FRET signals for each compartment. These FRET signals were corrected for the different Ran concentrations in each compartment to give normalized nuclear and cytoplasmic FRET values. The ratio of these two FRET values (the theoretical N/C FRET ratio) was then calculated. If there were no differences in the relative FRET signals in the nucleus versus the cytoplasm, this quotient would equal 1.0. A value of <1.0 indicates that the fraction of Ran complexes (i.e. of Ran conformers with an extended C-terminal tail) in the cytoplasm is less than in the nucleus. An experimental N/C FRET ratio was obtained from images of the cells microinjected with RGA by dividing the N/C ratio of the FRET image by the N/C ratio of the Ran (FAA) image. To create a FRET sensor for the conformation of the C terminus of Ran, we needed to attach a fluorescent donor to the C terminus itself, and a suitable acceptor chromophore elsewhere on the protein. GFP is an excellent FRET donor for the synthetic fluorophore Alexa546 (24Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The Ro value (the distance at which the FRET efficiency is 50%) for this pair is calculated to be 51 Å, which is roughly twice the mean diameter of Ran·GDP. In contrast to other small GTPases, the C terminus of Ran is not post-translationally modified by prenylation. The C-terminal region is also exposed, or predicted to be exposed, in all complexes of Ran with Ran-binding proteins for which structures have been solved to date, including those with NTF2, RanBD, importin-β, and Kapβ2 (2Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We therefore expected that a C-terminal fusion between Ran and GFP would not disrupt any essential biological function of Ran. To attach the acceptor to this fusion protein, we used Alexa546 maleimide. There are no exposed Cys residues on the surface of GFP that would react with this maleimide, and when GFP was treated with the adduct, as described under “Materials and Methods,” no detectable Alexa546 was conjugated to GFP (data not shown). There are 3 Cys residues on Ran, but only one of these is exposed on the protein surface (Fig. 1A). Fortunately, this residue, Cys-112, is not buried in any of the Ran complexes for which structures have been determined, suggesting that its modification would not disrupt these interactions. In other studies, we have labeled Ran with fluorophore-conjugated maleimide to a stoichiometry of one adduct per polypeptide; shown that the modified protein binds nucleotides, NTF2, RanBP1, and importin-β; is sensitive to RanGEF-facilitated nucleotide exchange; and is rapidly imported into the nucleus when injected into the cytoplasm of living cells (1Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structures of Ran·GDP and Ran in complex with other proteins suggested that the distance between a GFP attached to the C terminus of Ran and an Alexa546 moiety on Cys-112 of Ran would change dramatically between these different states (Fig.1A). When Ran-GFP (named RG) was excited at 467 nm, it displayed a single emission peak at 508 nm (Fig. 1B). Ran labeled with Alexa546 (named RA) showed negligible emission both at 508 and 568 nm (the emission peak for the Alexa fluorophore) when excited at 467 nm but did emit strongly at 568 nm when excited directly at 556 nm. However, when RG was labeled with Alexa546 to create the sensor (named RGA), it produced a substantial FRET signal when excited at 467 nm, with emission peaks at both 508 and 568 nm (Fig. 1B). At equal molar protein concentrations, the GFP emission of RGA at 508 nm was lower than that of RG, as predicted for a FRET donor. RGA was able to bind both 32P-GTP and 32P-GDP (data not shown), suggesting that it is functional. To test function more rigorously and to determine whether the FRET response would be sensitive to conformational changes in the Ran protein, we incubated RGA with excess importin-β or GST-RanBD (from RanBP1). These proteins are known to form complexes with Ran that deploy the C terminus in an extended conformation (11Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins caused an increase in emission of the donor GFP at 508 nm and a decrease in the emission of the acceptor at 568 nm, consistent with a drop in FRET efficiency caused by movement of the GFP away from the Alexa (Fig.2A). To determine the affinity of the RanBD for RGA, we titrated increasing concentrations of GST-RanBD into the RGA solution and quantified the change in the acceptor/donor fluorescence ratio. This change was corrected for the stoichiometry of modification by Alexa546 and converted to fractional binding and then plotted against the calculated free GST-RanBD (Fig.2B). The data were then fitted by an equation for binding to a single site on RGA, giving a calculated dissociation constant of ∼1.5 nm. This is similar to the estimatedKd for GST-RanBP1 binding to Ran as determined using plasmon resonance (25Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest that the RGA sensor is fully active and can bind a known factor with an affinity comparable with that for unmodified Ran·GTP. To determine whether conversion of free RGA between the GDP- and GTP-bound states induces a change in FRET efficiency, RGA was incubated with RanGEF (RCC1) plus GTP or with RanGAP plus GDP. As shown in Fig.2C, the FRET signals (FGA/FGGfluorescence ratio) from RGA subjected to these two treatments were identical. This result suggests that, as had been predicted, the C-terminal acidic tail is not released by conversion of Ran to the GTP-bound state, although the C-terminal loop must move out to accommodate changes in the Switch I region (11Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). When NTF2 was added to the RGA·GDP, a small but reproducible increase in FRET was observed (Fig. 2C). This effect may be because of conformational constraints on the orientation of the GFP, because there is no difference in the distances between Cys-112 and the (truncated) C terminus of free Ran·GDP and the Ran-NTF2 complex as determined from the crystal structures (10Scheffzek K. Klebe C. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 374: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Stewart M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Addition of importin-β alone, the GST-RanBD alone, or of the two factors together to RGA·GTP, all caused substantial drops in FRET of increasing magnitude (Fig. 2C). These effects are consistent with the known structures of the complexes. The C terminus of Ran bound to importin-β or Kapβ2 is believed to be displaced from the body of Ran but is not constrained by binding to the karyopherins (13Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar); whereas in a complex with a RanBD, the C terminus is wrapped around the RanBD and is held rigidly at a considerable distance from the body of the Ran protein (11Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We can use the FRET efficiency to estimate an average distance between the donor (GFP) and the acceptor (Alexa546) fluorophores, based on the assumption that the dipole moments of GFP and Alexa are oriented randomly with respect to one another (κ = 0.67) (24Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The calculated average distance between donor and acceptor fluorophores increases from ∼45 to 50 Å upon binding importin-β, to 54 Å on binding the RanBD, and to 57 Å on binding both importin-β and the RanBD. In the crystal structure of Ran·GDP, the distance from Cys-112 to a residue near the C terminus (Thr-207) is 31.5 Å, and in the crystal structure of the Ran-RanBD complex this distance is increased to about 43 Å. Therefore, the magnitude of the conformational change induced by the RanBD, as determined by FRET, is similar to that determined from the known crystal structures. This concordance shows that the RGA sensor responds appropriately to changes in the position of the C-terminal tail relative to Cys-112. Note that the extreme C terminus of Ran (amino acids 208–216) of the complexes with importin-β and Kapβ2 was not visible in the crystal structures, presumably because its conformation is unconstrained (13Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar,14Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To determine whether exportins also induce release of the C terminus of Ran, we measured the FRET of RGA-GTP in the presence of Crm1 and a peptide that corresponds to the nuclear export signal of MVM NS2 protein (22Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff F.R. Weeks D.L. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The NES peptide alone had no significant effect on the emission of the RGA. Crm1 alone caused a small decrease, consistent with the known low affinity of Crm1 for Ran·GTP in the absence of cargo. When added together, however, the Crm1 + NES caused a substantial drop in the FGA/FGG fluorescence ratio, suggesting that in the export-competent complex the C terminus of Ran is released (Fig. 3). The export cofactor, RanBP3, binds Ran·GTP with very low affinity (26Mueller L. Cordes V.C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but can form a complex with Ran·GTP and Crm1. RanBP3 increases the affinity of the Crm1 for export cargo (8Lindsay M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Englmeier L. Fornerod M. Bischoff F.R. Petosa C. Mattaj I.W. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 926-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, RanBP3 causes a greater drop in FRET efficiency, in the presence of Crm1, than does the NES. These data suggest that RanBP3 may behave in this complex like a classical RanBD, by embracing the deployed C terminus of Ran and holding it in a rigid, extended conformation. Taken together, these data support the general concept that all karyopherins, whether importins or exportins, release the C-terminal tail of Ran from its “docked” position on the body of the Ran protein and that RanBDs stabilize this extended conformation. One purpose for the release of the C terminus by karyopherins may be to increase the on-rate for RanBD binding, as has been proposed by Villa Braslavsky et al. (16Villa Braslavsky C.I. Nowak C. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Kuhlmann J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The RanBD functions as a co-activator of RanGAP, so this increased on-rate would be expected to increase the efficiency of GTP hydrolysis by RanGAP, and hence increase the efficiency with which the transport cycle is terminated in the cytoplasm. Whether there are other functions for the C terminus (e.g. in translocation through the nuclear pore complex) remains to be established. We also asked whether it is possible to use this RGA sensor to directly demonstrate the existence of a Ran·GTP gradient across the nuclear envelope of a living cell. The levels of each of the major forms of Ran in the cytoplasm and nucleus have been computed using a Virtual Cell model of nucleocytoplasmic transport, and the calculated values match well with those that have been accessible to experimental determination (1Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because from the present study we know the relative FGA/FGG fluorescence ratios for the major forms of RGA likely to be present in the cell, we can sum the contribution of each individual species to the overall FGA/FGGratio in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (e.g.nuclear FRET = ∑i(fractional distribution of species i) × iFGA/iFGG) (Fig.4A). This computation gives a theoretical N/C FRET ratio of ∼0.64. This ratio is <1. Correction for the differing concentrations of Ran in the two compartments provides a FRET value that reflects the proportion of Ran conformers in the “extended-tail” state. This FRET difference between the nucleus and cytoplasm is in principle detectable by fluorescence microscopy, using the appropriate filter sets. We therefore microinjected RGA into the cytoplasm of BHK21 cells, as described under “Materials and Methods.” We found that the FRET signal for RGA was predominately nucleoplasmic and, unexpectedly, the N/C ratio for the FRET signal was generally only 4% lower than the N/C ratio for the Ran (FAA) distribution itself (experimental N/C FRET ratio = 0.96) (Fig. 4, A and B). This result deviated substantially from our theoretical N/C FRET ratio and suggested that either the nuclear Ran·GTP is largely free rather than complexed to karyopherins or that cytoplasmic Ran exists in a complex that releases the C terminus. One known cytoplasmic Ran complex is Ran·GDP-NTF2, but NTF2 does not cause release of the C terminus. However, another potential complex with this property is Ran·GDP-importin-β-RanBP1. This interesting complex has been characterized in vitro, but its potential function in nuclear import is not understood, and it has not been shown to exist in vivo (7Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6818-6822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Chi N.C. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked if the C terminus of Ran is displaced in the ternary complex of RGA·GDP with importin-β and a RanBD. Ran·GDP does not form a complex with either of these factors alone, so it is not clear what conformation it would adopt when bound to both of them simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 4C, importin-β alone had no effect on FRET efficiency when the RGA was in the GDP-bound state, and the RanBD caused only a very small decrease (likely because of its high affinity for any residual RGA·GTP); however, addition of both factors caused a drop of almost 50% in the FGA/FGG fluorescence ratio, corresponding to a 7-Å shift in the C-terminal tail away from Cys-112. Therefore, the conformational change in Ran·GDP induced by formation of this ternary complex is similar to that induced in Ran·GTP binding to either importin-β or a RanBD and could account for the reduced FRET in the cytoplasm of microinjected cells. To test whether Ran·GDP forms a complex with importin-β and RanBP1in vivo, we developed a different, bipartite Ran-FRET sensor. RA was mixed with GST-GFP-RanBP1 (named G-BP1). Full-length RanBP1, as opposed to RanBD, was used in this cell-based assay to ensure its proper localization. RanBD, which lacks an essential nuclear export signal, redistributes to the nucleus upon microinjection in the cytoplasm and has been found to be toxic to cells (28Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When testedin vitro, this RA/G-BP1 sensor was functional. In the GTP-bound state it caused an increased FGA/FGGfluorescence ratio when mixed with G-BP1 (Fig.5) but, in the GDP-bound form, it only caused an increase in FGA/FGG ratio when both G-BP1 and importin-β were added together (Fig. 5). After establishing that this bipartite sensor was functional in vitro, we co-injected an equimolar mix of RA and G-BP1 into the cytoplasm of BHK21 cells and allowed the proteins to equilibrate. As expected, the RA redistributed primarily to the nucleus and the G-BP1 remained cytoplasmic (Fig. 6, panels a and c). RA alone and G-BP1 alone were similarly microinjected to establish the contributions of direct excitation (Fig. 6, panel f) and bleed-through fluorescence to the observed signals (Fig. 6, panel j). Images were taken with the three filter sets (FAA, FGA, FGG). A substantial amount of cytoplasmic FRET signal remained after direct excitation, and bleed-through fluorescence was subtracted from the RA/G-BP1 sensor signal (Fig. 6, panel d). Nuclear FRET could be clearly seen in a nucleus that was injected (Fig. 6, panel d, arrow). As a negative control, we co-injected RA together with GST-GFP, which cannot form a complex. This pair of proteins gave no detectable FRET signal (Fig. 6, panel p). To determine whether the FRET was because of cytoplasmic Ran·GTP that had not been hydrolyzed, we co-injected RanGAP along with the RA and G-BP1 (Fig. 6, panels q–t). However, the cytoplasmic FRET signal did not diminish under these conditions, contrary to the result expected if it were caused by unhydrolyzed cytoplasmic Ran·GTP in a complex with RanBP1 and importin-β. As a further test for the existence of a cytoplasmic Ran·GDP-importin-RanBP1 complex, we used tsBN2 cells that contain a thermolabile allele of the RanGEF (23Uchida S. Sekiguchi T. Nishitani H. Miyauchi K. Ohtsubo M. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Loss of RanGEF at the nonpermissive temperature for tsBN2 cells would be predicted to reduce the Ran·GTP concentration and increase cytoplasmic Ran·GDP (1Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Seino H. Nishimoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24542-24545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if the FRET signal were generated by a RA·GTP complex, it should decrease, but if it were generated by a RA·GDP complex, it should increase. When we compared the FRET and Ran (FAA) signals of microinjected tsBN2 cells that were grown at 33.5 versus 39.5 °C, we found that the shifted cells had a ∼68% higher cytoplasmic FRET signal than cells grown at the permissive temperature (Fig.7, A and B). This result argues strongly that the RA/G-BP1 biosensor is detecting a ternary cytoplasmic complex similar to that created by Ran·GDP-importin-β-RanBP1. Taken together, these results suggest that the release of the acidic C terminus of Ran is diagnostic of a complex with a karyopherin and/or RanBD. They also indicate the existence of a cytoplasmic ternary complex of Ran·GDP with karyopherins and RanBP1. This complex has not been taken into account in current models of nucleocytoplasmic transport, even though it has been characterized extensively in vitro, and may be general to members of the importin family (31Deane R. Schafer W. Zimmermann H.P. Mueller L. Gorlich D. Prehn S. Ponstingl H. Bischoff F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological function of such a complex remains to be determined. It would presumably reduce the concentration of free Ran·GDP in the cytoplasm and hence reduce the rate of formation of a Ran·GDP-NTF2 complex. The inclusion of such a complex in the Virtual Cell model (1Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), using accepted values for the dissociation constant, substantially reduces the Ran·GTP N/C ratio. 2I. G. Macara, unpublished observations. This difference implies that there are features of the model, or components, that need to be adjusted or added. One potential adjustment is that the Ran·GDP-importin-RanBP1 complex should be able to traverse the nuclear pore complex and may participate in cargo import. The careful analysis of more sophisticated transport models will be necessary to resolve this issue. While this work was in progress, Kalab et al. (32Kalab P. Weis K. Heald R. Science. 2002; 295: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) developed different Ran biosensors in which cyan and yellow versions of GFP were attached to either the RanBD of the yeast RanBP1 homolog, Yrb1p (YRC) or to the N-terminal fragment of importin-α (YIC). These probes successfully detected a Ran·GTP gradient in frog egg extracts to which sperm chromatin had been added and a high nuclear/cytoplasmic Ran·GTP gradient. We surmise that the YRC probe cannot form a ternary complex with Ran·GDP and importins, perhaps because of steric hindrance caused by a C-terminal CFP fusion, or that some other factor present in frog extracts prevents the formation of this complex with YRC, which would otherwise suffer from the same disadvantage as the RGA sensor described here. Together, these studies demonstrate that several types of FRET biosensors for Ran can be created that address different aspects of the functions of this GTPase."

(1993) 2, 1997–1998) noticed that residues 495–513 of the carboxylase shares similarity with the propeptide. They suggested that this internal propeptide could bind intramolecularly to the propeptide binding site of carboxylase, thereby preventing carboxylation of substrates lacking a propeptide recognition sequence. To test Price's hypothesis, we created nine mutant enzyme species that have single or double mutations within this putative internal propeptide. The apparent K d values of these mutant enzymes for human factor IX propeptide varied from 0.5- to 287-fold when compared with that of wild type enzyme. These results are consistent with the internal propeptide hypothesis but could also be explained by these residues participating in propeptide binding site per se. To distinguish between the two alternative hypotheses, we measured the dissociation rates of propeptides from each of the mutant enzymes. Changes in an internal propeptide should not affect the dissociation rates, but changes to a propeptide binding site may affect the dissociation rate. We found that dissociation rates varied in a manner consistent with the apparentK d values measured above. Furthermore, kinetic studies using propeptide-containing substrates demonstrated a correlation between the affinity for propeptide andV max. Taken together, our results indicated that these mutations affected the propeptide binding site rather than a competitive inhibitory internal propeptide sequence.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 499: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the post-translational modification of a number of vitamin K-dependent proteins (e.g. the coagulation proteins prothrombin, factor VII, factor IX, factor X, protein S, protein C, and protein Z) (2Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 3Suttie J.W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

Vitamin K-dependent carboxylase utilizes the substrates: reduced vitamin K, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and a propeptide-containing substrate. Multiple glutamic acid residues of the polypeptide substrate, within about 40 residues of the propeptide, are usually modified to γ-carboxyglutamate during a single binding event (10Morris D.P. Stevens R.D. Wright D.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30491-30498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The primary interaction between the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and its substrates is mediated by the 18-amino acid propeptide sequence (11Pan L.C. Price P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6109-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in all known vitamin K-dependent proteins, except for matrix Gla protein, is removed prior to secretion. The role of the substrate's propeptide is to anchor it to the carboxylase for a time sufficient for multiple carboxylations (13Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Brown C.L. Shoemaker C.B. Furie B. Cell. 1987; 48: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in anchoring the substrate to the carboxylase, binding of the propeptide to carboxylase also significantly stimulates the incorporation of CO2 into non-propeptide-containing substrates (12Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cheung A. Engelke J.A. Sanders C. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that, at 20 °C, the affinities (measured as K i) of the various propeptides for carboxylase vary from about 5 nm for factor X to greater than 500 μm for bone Gla protein (15Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that a consensus propeptide bound considerably tighter to carboxylase than any known naturally occurring propeptide (16Stanley T.B. Humphries J. High K.A. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15681-15687Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Knobloch and Suttie (12Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that the propeptide of factor X decreased the K m and increased theV max of the carboxylase for the small Glu-containing substrate FLEEL.1 They proposed that this stimulation resulted in propeptide-containing substrates being selectively modified by the carboxylase. Based upon this suggestion, Price and Williamson (17Price P.A. Williamson M.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1987-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) searched the carboxylase for a sequence that could compete with the propeptide for its substrates. They searched the 24-amino acid sequence of exon 3 of the human matrix Gla protein and found a sequence within the carboxylase homologous with the propeptide sequence. Based upon the earlier observation that the propeptide stimulated incorporation of CO2 into FLEEL, they postulated that residues 495–513 of the carboxylase functioned as an internal propeptide, and could bind intramolecularly to the propeptide binding site. They further suggested that this intramolecular interaction would prevent carboxylation of proteins lacking the propeptide docking sequence. To test this hypothesis, they proposed that one should reduce the affinity of the internal propeptide for the propeptide binding site by mutating the highly conserved phenylalanine that corresponded to −16 of the propeptide. With our knowledge that the consensus sequence propeptide binds tightly to carboxylase (16Stanley T.B. Humphries J. High K.A. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15681-15687Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we set out to test Price's hypothesis. We hypothesized that if we made the putative internal propeptide sequence more (or less) like the consensus sequence, the intramolecular binding should be tighter (or weaker) and that it would require higher (or lower) concentrations of propeptide to stimulate CO2 incorporation into the small substrate FLEEL. To test the hypothesis that there was an internal propeptide, we made nine single or double mutations in the putative internal propeptide of human carboxylase and tested their effect on the carboxylase molecule. Our results strongly suggest that the proposed internal propeptide contributes to the propeptide binding site rather than to a self-regulatory domain. All chemicals were reagent grade.

In the synthesis of the fluorescein-labeled propeptides, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was conjugated to the amino terminus of the propeptide. Purity of all peptides was determined by mass spectrometry and high pressure liquid chromatography and was found to be ∼95%. The pSK− vector was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

All constructs having carboxylase sequence were flanked by sequences coding for the FLAG (DYKDDDDK) tag at their amino termini and by the HPC4 tag (EDQVDPRLIDGK) (20Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J.

The presence of these tags does not appear to alter the properties of the carboxylase molecule; i.e. its activity and kinetic properties are not measurably different from the wild type enzyme. The DNA sequence of each construct was determined in its entirety by the DNA sequence facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The engineered DNAs were subcloned into the pVL1392 vector, and the proteins were expressed in baculovirus-infected High Five cells as previously described (15Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J.

Solubilization and isolation of microsomes from High Five cells were done as previously described (15Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol.

The enzyme preparations were preincubated with 0.067 m iodoacetamide at 37 °C for 15 min to eliminate the effects of dithiothreitol on the protein assay reagents. The total protein concentrations (including both active and inactive enzyme) were determined by using Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay kits and IgG protein standard following the supplier's protocol. The active concentration of our enzyme preparations was determined by titration with FproCon as described below. All of the measurements were performed in a 400-μl fluorimetric quartz curette (Starna Cells, Atascadero, CA) at 4.5 °C in a final sample volume of 300 μl. Enzymes and propeptides were preincubated for 1 h in standard buffer containing 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 166 mmNaCl, 3.5% glycerol, 6.3 mm dithiothreitol, 66 μm EDTA, 0.1% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 0.28% CHAPS, and 0.4% bovine serum albumin. The fluorescence intensity of plane polarized light at four mutually perpendicular polarizing filter settings (I VV,I VH, I HV, andI HH) of samples was measured with an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorimeter equipped with Glan-Thompson polarizing filters in the excitation and emission beams; each point represents the average of six readings. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 525 nm, respectively. Anisotropy was calculated from the four measured intensities as previously described (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluoresence Spectroscopy. Plenum, New York1999: 308-309Google Scholar, 22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentration of active enzyme in a purified carboxylase preparation was determined by measuring the number of propeptide binding sites in the preparation. Previous work indicates a correlation between the presence of a propeptide binding site and catalytic activity and indicates that only active enzyme can bind propeptide. Therefore, a measurement of the concentration of propeptide binding sites in a carboxylase preparation is a measurement of the concentration of the active fraction of enzyme (22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For each sample, the fraction of FproCon bound to carboxylase was determined from the anisotropy value, and the concentration of propeptide binding sites (active enzyme) was determined from the fraction bound versus [carboxylase] plot as previously described (22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, when appropriate conditions are chosen (concentration of FproCon ≫ K d), anisotropy of FproCon increases linearly with increasing carboxylase concentration to about 75% saturation. The equivalence point of active carboxylase concentration was determined from the intersection of a linear regression of the data points (up to 75% fraction bound) with a horizontal line determined from the saturation value (100% fraction bound). All enzyme concentrations used in the calculation of kinetic constants were the active enzyme concentrations determined by its ability to bind propeptide (22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R.

The time course of FproFIX19 release from wild type and mutant carboxylases was measured essentially as described previously (22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the wild type or P495V/Q497A, F496A, and Q503R carboxylases, 10 nm active enzyme was preincubated with 25 nm FproFIX19 in standard buffer at 4.5 °C for 1 h to allow the mixture to come to equilibrium. A 350-fold excess of unlabeled proFIX19 was added at time 0. The sample was added to a microcuvette and was placed into the sample holder of the SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorimeter. Intensity measurements were taken at 20-s intervals as previously described (22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the anisotropy at each data point was calculated (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluoresence Spectroscopy. Plenum, New York1999: 308-309Google Scholar). For the mutants V502A, V502A/P504Q, S510A, and W512A, 100 nm active carboxylase was premixed with 100 nm FproFIX19 to achieve a starting anisotropy value significantly above base line. For the mutants Q503N and P504Q, 50 nm carboxylase was premixed with 100 nmFproFIX19. All off rate experiments were carried out at 4.5 °C, and all data were well fitted to a model of propeptide release described by a single exponential decay, at=(ai−af)exp(−k∗t)+afEquation 1 where a t is the anisotropy at timet, a i and a f are the anisotropies at initial and final time, respectively, k is the first-order rate constant, and t is time. Time course data were fitted to Equation 1 by minimizing the parametersa i, a f, and k. The changes in fluorescent intensity of FproFIX19 upon binding to the wild type and all mutant enzymes were found to be insignificant and did not affect the fraction bound, so rate constants could be accurately determined directly from the anisotropy data (22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed with 20 nm active carboxylase in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.16% CHAPS, 0.16% phosphatidylcholine, 222 μm vitamin K hydroquinone, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of NaH14CO3 (specific activity, 54 mCi/mmol), and 1.5 mm FLEEL. The desired concentration of proFIX19 was included in each reaction. Reactions were at 20 °C for 30 min as previously described (19Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Solera J. Brenner B. Azerad R. Wu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32572-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fraction of bound enzymes (f b) was determined using the following equation: f b = (V obs −V f)/(V sat − Vf). TheV obs, V f, and Vsat refer to FLEEL carboxylation velocity in the presence of a certain concentration of proFIX19, in the absence of proFIX19, and in the presence of saturating proFIX19 respectively. The apparentK d of wild type and mutant carboxylase was determined from f b as previously described (22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,23Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23696-23706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinetic studies of FLEEL carboxylation, 20 nm active carboxylase was used for each reaction. Reactions were performed in the presence or absence of saturating proFIX19 at 20 °C for 30 min and were carried out as described above, except that the concentration of the substrate FLEEL was varied from 0 to 40 mm for V502A and S510A and from 0 to 20 mm for other mutants in the absence of proFIX19. In the presence of saturating proFIX19, the concentration of the substrate FLEEL was varied from 0 to 4.8 mm. For kinetic studies of propeptide-containing substrates, FIX Q/S, consisting of residues −18 to +41 of human FIX with mutations at −4 (Arg → Gln), −1 (Arg → Ser), and 19 (Met → Ile), was used. Previous studies have shown that there is no significant difference in kinetic properties between a wild type substrate and the FIX Q/S (24Wu S.M. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty nm active carboxylase was used for each reaction. Reactions were performed at 20 °C for 60 min in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.16% CHAPS, 0.16% phosphatidycholine, 222 μm vitamin K hydroquinone, 6 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of NaH14CO3. The concentration of the propeptide-containing substrate FIX Q/S, was varied from 0 to 2500 nm. To measure the rate of FproCon to carboxylase, 150 nm of wild type, V502A, S510A, or W512A enzyme was added to standard buffer containing 10 nmFproCon at time 0. 20 s after adding enzymes, the anisotropy values were measured at 5-s intervals. The anisotropy at each time point was converted to fraction bound of FproCon as previously described (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluoresence Spectroscopy. Plenum, New York1999: 308-309Google Scholar, 22Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our previous results indicate that once FproCon bound to wild type, V502A, S510A, or W512A carboxylase, it would not come off within 12 h (data not shown). Thus, the contributions to the changes of anisotropy in our experiments of the release of FproCon from carboxylase can be ignored. All measurements were performed at 4.5 °C, and all data were fitted to a pseudo-first order reaction equation, c=b∗(1−exp(−k∗a∗t))Equation 2 where c represents the concentration of carboxylase-FproCon complex, b is the total concentration of FproCon, a is the total concentration of enzyme,t is time in seconds, and k is the rate constant. To investigate the function of the putative internal propeptide region of carboxylase, we made several mutations in the region identified by Price and Williamson. These mutations were designed to make the putative internal propeptide sequence either more like or less like a consensus propeptide sequence. The consensus sequence, which was determined by selecting the most prevalent amino acid at each position in all known propeptides, binds to the carboxylase with an affinity much higher than any known, naturally occurring, propeptide (16Stanley T.B. Humphries J. High K.A. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15681-15687Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fig. 1demonstrates the alignment of the proposed internal propeptide region with the consensus human propeptide and the corresponding region of the mutations used in this paper. If region 495–513 contains an internal propeptide, then mutations rendering it more like the consensus sequence (e.g. V502A, Q503N, P504Q, and the double mutations P495V/Q497L and V502A/P504Q) would be expected to cause stronger intramolecular interactions with the propeptide binding site. These mutations would cause a decrease in the apparent affinity for the propeptide. Conversely, mutations making the region diverge from the consensus sequence (e.g. F496A and Q503R) should reduce the binding between the propeptide binding site and the putative internal propeptide, resulting in an apparent increased affinity for propeptide. S510A and W512A were mutated to test the alternative hypothesis. The free propeptide of the vitamin K-dependent proteins has been shown to stimulate the rate of carboxylation of FLEEL (12Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the apparentK d of propeptide can be determined by measuring the velocities of FLEEL carboxylation at varied propeptide concentrations. Fig. 2 shows a plot of enzyme fraction bound versus proFIX19 concentrations. The apparentK d of proFIX19 for wild type enzyme was 7.3 ± 0.5 nm, whereas the apparent K d for mutant enzymes varied from 4.2 ± 0.1 to 2200 ± 50 nm (Table I). However, P495V/Q497A and F496A were not significantly different from wild type enzyme (Table I). It is notable that the maximum stimulated rates of FLEEL carboxylation were comparable for all mutants and wild type enzyme.Table IThe apparent Kd for proFIX19 and the maximal stimulated FLEEL carboxylation velocities for wild type and mutant carboxylaseEnzymeApparentK d for proFIX19DifferenceMaximal stimulated activityDifferencenm-foldpmol14CO2 /min/pmol enzyme-foldWild type7.3 ± 0.51.029.1 ± 1.11.0P495V/Q497A9.4 ± 1.31.326.2 ± 2.60.9F496A8.8 ± 0.71.227.1 ± 1.60.9V502A53.7 ± 3.17.428.9 ± 1.31.0V502A/P504Q51.2 ± 4.97.028.2 ± 1.21.0Q503N24.4 ± 1.73.328.0 ± 1.21.0Q503R4.2 ± 0.10.626.6 ± 0.40.9P504Q11.7 ± 1.51.628.0 ± 1.61.0S510A2200 ± 5028725.9 ± 0.90.9W512A1770 ± 5824228.9 ± 1.21.0 Open table in a new tab The binding sites for glutamate and propeptide appear to be functionally linked (12Knobloch J.E.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of these mutations on the kinetics of CO2 incorporation into FLEEL. Kinetic constants for FLEEL carboxylation were determined in the presence or absence of saturating proFIX19. In the absence of proFIX19, Q503R (which has the highest affinity for proFIX19) was found to have the lowestK m (1.90 mm). In contrast, theK m values for FLEEL of V502A, Q503N, and S510A vary from 4.7 to more than 30 mm and are higher than the 3.33 mm of wild type enzyme. The affinity of these mutants (V502A, Q503N, Q503R, and S510A) for FLEEL appears to increase or decrease in parallel with their affinities for proFIX19 (Fig.3 a and TableII). As shown in Fig. 3, although the affinities in the absence of propeptide (inferred from theK m values toward FLEEL) are different from that of wild type enzyme, their V max values are similar to that of the wild type enzyme in the presence of saturating proFIX19. The kinetic constants for FLEEL carboxylation in the presence of saturating proFIX19 were also determined. Fig. 3 bdemonstrates that, in the presence of saturating proFIX19, theK m and V max values of all mutants were similar to wild type enzyme. It is notable that, except for S510A and W512A, the V max values of most mutations and the wild type enzyme were consistently increased 3-fold when the mutant enzymes were saturated with proFIX19 (Table II).Table IIComparison of kinetic parameters for FLEELEnzymeFLEEL without proFIX19FLEEL with saturating proFIX19K mV maxK mV maxmmpmol14CO2 /min/pmol enzymemmpmol14CO2 /min/pmol enzymeWild type3.3 ± 0.417.0 ± 2.60.78 ± 0.1250.4 ± 1.7P495V/Q497A3.8 ± 0.316.3 ± 2.00.82 ± 0.0748.0 ± 2.6F496A3.6 ± 0.217.5 ± 3.00.84 ± 0.0948.2 ± 2.0V502A8.0 ± 0.116.5 ± 0.80.79 ± 0.0749.6 ± 1.2V502A/P504Q7.6 ± 0.716.5 ± 2.10.80 ± 0.1648.7 ± 2.9Q503N4.7 ± 0.415.6 ± 1.50.79 ± 0.0446.0 ± 2.6Q503R1.9 ± 0.217.2 ± 2.50.78 ± 0.1151.8 ± 3.7P504Q3.4 ± 0.316.5 ± 3.50.79 ± 0.1348.6 ± 3.3S510A>308.1 ± 0.80.93 ± 0.0847.4 ± 1.1W512A3.2 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.20.76 ± 0.0638.2 ± 2.8 Open table in a new tab Thus far, our data are consistent with Price's hypothesis (17Price P.A. Williamson M.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1987-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, we might obtain the same effects if we were mutating the propeptide binding site instead of an internal propeptide. We realized that if mutations were in the proposed internal propeptide site, then, neglecting linkage, they should not affect the off rate of a bound propeptide. If, however, the region mutated was part of the propeptide binding site, the off rate might be affected. As shown in Fig.4, the time course of anisotropy loss due to FproFIX19 release can be satisfactorily fit to a single exponential decay curve, which allows us to determine the off rate constants. The off rate constant for FproFIX19 release from wild type carboxylase was found to be 6.77 ± 0.19 × 10−4s−1, whereas the rate constants for mutants varied from 3.46 ± 0.12 × 10−4 s−1 for Q503R"
https://openalex.org/W2410517273,"Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been shown to suppress the development of cancer. Tamoxifen (TAM), a nonsteroidal anti-estrogen that is widely used in chemotherapy, is known to be a modulator of antioxidant status. However, the mechanism by which TAM mediates antioxidant enzyme induction remains unclear. In this study we investigated TAM enhancement of MnSOD induction by TNF-α. The results show that co-treatment with TAM and TNF-α increases the MnSOD promoter/enhancer driven luciferase activity, MnSOD mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, co-treatment with TAM and TNF-α drastically decreases the binding activity of the p50/p50 homodimer and increases that of the p50/p65 heterodimer compared to TNF-α alone. This change in DNA binding could not be attributed to a decrease in the level of p50, its precursor, p105, or its inhibitors. Furthermore, TAM did not enhance degradation of IκB-α. These results suggest that p50/p50 homodimer may act as an inhibitory complex of MnSOD expression. Modulation of the DNA binding activity in favor of the p50/p65 complex may enhance NF-κB mediated induction of MnSOD by TAM. These findings reveal a potential novel mechanism for the induction of the human MnSOD gene."
https://openalex.org/W2025087599,"Synaptotagmin VII (Syt VII), a proposed regulator for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, showed a robust Ca2+-dependent oligomerization property via its two C2 domains (Fukuda, M., and Mikoshiba, K. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 27670–27676), but little is known about its structure or the critical residues directly involved in the oligomerization interface. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric analysis between Syt I and Syt VII showed that three Asp residues in Ca2+-binding loop 1 or 3 (Asp-172, Asp-303, and Asp-357) are crucial to robust Ca2+-dependent oligomerization. Unlike Syt I, however, the polybasic sequence in the β4 strands of the C2 structures (so-called “C2 effector domain”) is not involved in the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII. The results also showed that the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains cooperatively mediate Syt VII oligomerization (i.e. the presence of redundant Ca2+-binding site(s)) as well as the importance of Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII in Ca2+-regulated secretion. Expression of wild-type tandem C2 domains of Syt VII in PC12 cells inhibited Ca2+-dependent neuropeptide Y release, whereas mutant fragments lacking Ca2+-dependent oligomerization activity had no effect. Finally, rotary-shadowing electron microscopy showed that the Ca2+-dependent oligomer of Syt VII is “a large linear structure,” not an irregular aggregate. By contrast, in the absence of Ca2+ Syt VII molecules were observed to form a globular structure. Based on these results, we suggest that the linear Ca2+-dependent oligomer may be aligned at the fusion site between vesicles and plasma membrane and modulate Ca2+-regulated exocytosis by opening or dilating fusion pores.

In this study, we attempt to identify the residues (or an oligomerization interface) critical to the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII and the functional relationship between the two C2 domains. We show by site-directed mutagenesis that, unlike Syt I, Ca2+-dependent homo- and hetero-oligomerization of Syt VII are cooperatively mediated by the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains, not by the putative C2 effector domains. Moreover, whereas expression of the wild-type cytoplasmic tandem C2 domains in PC12 cells inhibited Ca2+-dependent neuropeptide Y (NPY) release, mutant proteins incapable of Ca2+-dependent oligomerization had no effect on NPY release. Furthermore, we show by rotary-shadowing electron microscopy that the Ca2+-dependent Syt VII oligomer has a linear structure and is not a random aggregate. Based on these findings, we discuss how the Ca2+-dependent Syt oligomer regulates vesicular exocytosis.DISCUSSIONIn our previous study, we showed that a single C2 domain of Syt VII is sufficient for Ca2+-dependent homomultimerization and hetero-oligomerization with other Syt isoforms (18Fukuda M.

In this paper, we have presented several lines of evidence indicating that the two C2 domains of Syt VII are not functionally independent and that the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains cooperatively mediate Ca2+-dependent oligomerization. First, mutation of the single Asp residue (D172N in the C2A domain or D303N in the C2B domain) in Ca2+-binding loop 1 abrogated the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of the “isolated C2 domain” but was neutral in regard to the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of the “tandem C2 domains” (Figs. 2 and 3). The tandem C2 domains with the double mutation (D172N/D303N), however, did not show Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization, suggesting the presence of redundant Ca2+-binding site(s). Second, chimeric analysis between Syt I and Syt VII showed that pairing of the C2A and C2B domains is an important factor for efficient Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII (Fig. 4). Based on these results, together with the recent crystallographic data showing that the Ca2+-binding regions of the two C2 domains of Syt III face each other (45Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we propose that the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains directly contribute to formation of the oligomerization interface; Ca2+ binding to the Asp residues in the loops of the C2 structures changes the electrostatic charges around the loop domains, which may directly form the oligomerization interface between two C2 domains. This model is completely different from the model of Syt I (or II), which also showed Ca2+-dependent oligomerization mediated by the C2B effector domain but not the Ca2+-binding loops themselves (16Chapman E.R.

The structure of the Ca2+-dependent oligomer of Syt I is now under investigation in our laboratory, and it will be interesting to determine whether the Ca2+-dependent Syt I oligomer exhibits the same linear structure.We also demonstrated the physiological importance of the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII by using the dominant negative approach (28Sugita S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When the wild-type tandem C2 fragment was expressed in PC12 cells, Ca2+-dependent NPY release was significantly inhibited, most likely by competing endogenous Syt proteins. By contrast, the mutants lacking Ca2+-dependent oligomerization activity had no effect on NPY release (Fig. 5).Although the exact role of the Ca2+-dependent oligomer of Syt VII in vesicular exocytosis is unknown, based on the structure of the Ca2+-dependent oligomer of Syt VII (i.e. the linear structure) visualized by rotary-shadowing electron microscopy (Fig. 7), it may be involved in dilation or opening of fusion pores by aligning to form a straight line at the fusion site between the vesicles and plasma membrane (48Littleton J.T.

Consistent with this hypothesis, Syt I and IV have recently been shown to modulate fusion pore kinetics in regulated exocytosis of PC12 cells (49Wang C.T. Grishanin R. Earles C.A. Chang P.Y. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2001; 294: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Further work is necessary to examine the effect of wild-type or mutant (D172N/D303N) expression on fusion pore kinetics to clarify the relationship between Syt VII oligomerization and fusion pore formation.In summary, site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric analysis in this study demonstrated that the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains cooperatively mediate both Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII and Ca2+-dependent NPY release. We have also shown that the Ca2+-dependent Syt VII oligomer is a linear structure, not an irregular random aggregate. Neuronal exocytosis is an extremely rapid process precisely controlled by Ca2+ ions. Ca2+-binding proteins (so-called “Ca2+ sensors”) must be present in the synaptic vesicle to achieve fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane in response to the rapid increase in Ca2+ ions (reviewed in Ref. 1Bennett M.R. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Genetic, structural, and biochemical studies during the past decade have indicated that synaptotagmin I (Syt I),1 an abundant synaptic vesicle protein, is the most likely candidate for the major Ca2+ sensor for neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system (Ref. 2Fernandez-Chacon R.

Syt I contains one transmembrane domain and two C2 Ca2+-binding modules (the membrane-proximal C2A domain and membrane distal C2B domain) in the large cytoplasmic domain. The two C2 domains exhibit completely different biochemical properties in terms of phospholipid binding (3Marquèze B. Berton F. Seagar M.

Whereas these Ca2+-dependent actions of the C2 domains are now believed to be an essential component of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, how they drive membrane fusion in response to Ca2+ remains unknown. The manner in which C2B oligomer is assembled (i.e. structure of Ca2+-dependent oligomer) on the synaptic vesicle is also unknown. Syt has been found to comprise a large family of molecules both in vertebrates and in invertebrates (e.g. Drosophilia, Caenorhabditis elegans, andArabidopsis thaliana) (Ref. 21Craxton M. Genomics. 2001; 77: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and references therein) and to share the same domain structure: an N-terminal single transmembrane domain, a spacer domain of varying length, two C2 domains, and a short carboxyl terminus (3Marquèze B.

However, the Ca2+-binding ability of the C2A domain differs among murine Syt isoforms, and some of them fail to bind Ca2+ ions as a result of amino acid substitutions of key Asp/Glu residues responsible for Ca2+binding (13Fukuda M.

By contrast, the mutants lacking Ca2+-dependent oligomerization activity had no effect on NPY release (Fig. 5).Although the exact role of the Ca2+-dependent oligomer of Syt VII in vesicular exocytosis is unknown, based on the structure of the Ca2+-dependent oligomer of Syt VII (i.e. the linear structure) visualized by rotary-shadowing electron microscopy (Fig. 7), it may be involved in dilation or opening of fusion pores by aligning to form a straight line at the fusion site between the vesicles and plasma membrane (48Littleton J.T.

Consistent with this hypothesis, Syt I and IV have recently been shown to modulate fusion pore kinetics in regulated exocytosis of PC12 cells (49Wang C.T. Grishanin R. Earles C.A. Chang P.Y. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2001; 294: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Further work is necessary to examine the effect of wild-type or mutant (D172N/D303N) expression on fusion pore kinetics to clarify the relationship between Syt VII oligomerization and fusion pore formation.In summary, site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric analysis in this study demonstrated that the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains cooperatively mediate both Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII and Ca2+-dependent NPY release. We have also shown that the Ca2+-dependent Syt VII oligomer is a linear structure, not an irregular random aggregate. In our previous study, we showed that a single C2 domain of Syt VII is sufficient for Ca2+-dependent homomultimerization and hetero-oligomerization with other Syt isoforms (18Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27670-27676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the functional relationship between the two C2 domains and the structure of the Syt VII oligomer had never been determined. In this paper, we have presented several lines of evidence indicating that the two C2 domains of Syt VII are not functionally independent and that the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains cooperatively mediate Ca2+-dependent oligomerization. First, mutation of the single Asp residue (D172N in the C2A domain or D303N in the C2B domain) in Ca2+-binding loop 1 abrogated the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of the “isolated C2 domain” but was neutral in regard to the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of the “tandem C2 domains” (Figs. 2 and 3). The tandem C2 domains with the double mutation (D172N/D303N), however, did not show Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization, suggesting the presence of redundant Ca2+-binding site(s). Second, chimeric analysis between Syt I and Syt VII showed that pairing of the C2A and C2B domains is an important factor for efficient Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII (Fig. 4). Based on these results, together with the recent crystallographic data showing that the Ca2+-binding regions of the two C2 domains of Syt III face each other (45Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we propose that the Ca2+-binding loops of the two C2 domains directly contribute to formation of the oligomerization interface; Ca2+ binding to the Asp residues in the loops of the C2 structures changes the electrostatic charges around the loop domains, which may directly form the oligomerization interface between two C2 domains. This model is completely different from the model of Syt I (or II), which also showed Ca2+-dependent oligomerization mediated by the C2B effector domain but not the Ca2+-binding loops themselves (16Chapman E.R.

The structure of the Ca2+-dependent oligomer of Syt I is now under investigation in our laboratory, and it will be interesting to determine whether the Ca2+-dependent Syt I oligomer exhibits the same linear structure. We also demonstrated the physiological importance of the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII by using the dominant negative approach (28Sugita S. Han W. Butz S. Liu X. Fernandez-Chacon R.

We conclude that the secondary RNA-tracking site consists of amino acids whose putative orientation faces the central hole in Rho and in part reside in two clusters of positively charged residues located above and below the ATP hydrolysis domain. Rho transcription termination factor is one of several nucleic acid-binding proteins belonging to a family of helicases with a homohexameric structure shaped like a toroid ring that utilizes the hydrolysis of ATP to move along the nucleic acid (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 2Bird L.E. Subramanya H.H. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Rho protein binds to a poorly defined cytosine-rich sequence on nascent RNA called a rut site (Rho utilization), which contains little or no secondary structure. Rut sites are usually found upstream from the start of specific genes or between genes in operons (3Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and once Rho binds to the rut site, it tracks 5′ to 3′ toward the stalled RNA polymerase. In a poorly defined mechanism that may require helicase activity (4Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), Rho disrupts the polymerase-transcript complex, thereby terminating transcription. Bicyclomycin, a commercial antibiotic, has been shown to inhibit Rho function (5Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) specifically by interfering with the tracking of Rho (6Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bicyclomycin inhibits the growth of many Gram-negative organisms, including Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Salmonella (7Williams R.M. Durham C.A. Chem. Rev. 1988; 88: 511-540Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and at least one Gram-positive bacterium, Micrococcus luteus (8Nowatzke W.L. Keller E. Koch G. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5238-5240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inferring the vital nature of Rho for cellular function (9Das A. Court D. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Rho monomer consists of 419 amino acid residues divided into two structural domains, a primary RNA-binding domain (residues 1–151) and the ATP hydrolysis domain (residues 167–419), which is based upon structural similarity with F1-ATP synthase (12Dombroski A.J. LaDine J.R. Cross R.L. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18810-18815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA-binding domain contains a DGFGFLR (amino acid residues 60–66) conserved RPN-1 RNA recognition motif (13Martinez A. Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Brennan C.A. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17296-17305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A solution structure of the N-terminal 130 residues of Rho has been solved using NMR techniques (15Briercheck D.M. Wood T.C. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and a crystal structure is also available (16Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The primary RNA-binding domain sits as a cap on the toroid ring, distinct from the ATP hydrolysis domain, and binds RNA tightly. ATPase activity is induced by the addition of poly(C) to Rho. Substitution of poly(dC) for poly(C) leads to tight Rho binding but no ATP hydrolysis. The addition of short oligoribonucleotides (7–10 residues long with a predominance of cytosine residues) to the Rho-poly(dC) complex activates ATPase activity. The activation by ribo(C)10 is thought to occur at the secondary RNA-binding/tracking site (3Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the projected Q-loop region, positioned on top, inside the toroid ring, facing the central hole of Rho, has been implicated in RNA binding, and this RNA-binding domain changes conformation upon binding ATP (17Wei R.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28380-28387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A model for Rho tracking coupled to ATP hydrolysis that relies on the structural similarity between Rho and the β-subunit of F1-ATP synthase and utilizes residues facing inside of the central hole in Rho has been put forth (18Vincent F. Openshaw M. Trautwein M. Gaskell S.J. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9077-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A strip of positively charged amino acids on Rho positioned toward the inside of the hole was identified based on the structure of bovine F1-ATP synthase (12Dombroski A.J. LaDine J.R. Cross R.L.

Gaskell S.J. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9077-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This model takes into account three active ATP hydrolysis sites per hexamer, sequential hydrolysis of ATP, Rho activation by short oligoribonucleotides, and the discrimination between hydrolytic and inactive subunits. The strip of positive charges was projected to bind the polyphosphate backbone of the RNA as Rho translocates toward the RNA polymerase. The positive charges were clustered into two separate loci found near the N and C termini surrounding the ATP hydrolysis domain. In this paper, we report the effects of site mutations carried out on these amino acid residues. We document the importance of positive charges for Rho to hydrolyze ATP, to bind RNA, and to terminate transcripts. Bicyclomycin was kindly provided by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and was further purified by three successive silica gel chromatographies using 20% methanol-chloroform as the eluant (20Park H. Zhang X. Moon H. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnology, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega Co. (Madison, WI). Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The metal chelating column was from Amersham Biosciences. Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and nucleotides and RNase inhibitors were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Polyethylenimine thin-layer chromatography plates used for ATPase assays were purchased from J. T. Baker, Inc. Ribo(C)10 was obtained from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). All other chemicals were reagent grade. The plasmid pET-RhoW that contained wild-type rho (19Magyar A. Zhang X. Abdi F. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7316-7324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used as a template for DNA amplification. Overlapping primers with the desired mutation were used to introduce base changes, as described in the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting PCR-amplified plasmid DNA was digested withDpnI and transformed into host strain JM109. Isolated plasmid DNA from the transformed cells was sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 377 sequencer using the Big Dye reaction kit to identify sequences with specific site changes. The entire rho gene was sequenced to ensure that no other mutations were present in the singly mutated gene. One of four expression systems were used to generate soluble and functional mutant Rho proteins: the pET14b expression vector using host strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (T7 polymerase) (Novagen), the pET14b vector in the salt-induced T7 polymerase host BL21SI (Invitrogen), the pBAD33 vector (arabinose induction) using host strain MG1655 (21Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar), and the pET14b vector with the λ host HMS174 expressed by introducing T7 polymerase by transfection with λ phage CE6 (Novagen). For expression using host BL21(DE3)pLysS, HSM174, or BL21SI, the original pET14b vector was used. Expression of mutant Rho using the arabinose promoter in the vector pBAD33 required excising the XbaI-HindIII fragment of the pET14b vector that contained the entire rhogene including the upstream SD sequence but shy of the T7 promoter, and ligating it into a similarly digested pBAD33 vector. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into host MG1655, and expression was induced by adding 0.2% arabinose to cells. To isolate Rho, cells were centrifuged, resuspended, and lysed by the addition of lysozyme (130 μg ml−1) and 0.05% deoxycholate. After brief sonication using a Branson sonicator, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was placed on a metal chelating column (AmershamBiosciences) bound with Ni2+. After washing, the bound protein Rho was recovered using a linear gradient of 0–0.5m imidazole. SDS electrophoresis of the isolated Rho showed only one peptide at 47,000 Da. Rho protein was dialyzed against storage buffer and kept at −80 °C until used. Poly(C)-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity was measured as described previously (19Magyar A. Zhang X. Abdi F. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7316-7324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) varying the ATP concentrations from 9.1 to 100 μm. The reactions were initiated by adding 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and varying concentrations of ATP to a solution of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.4 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 40 nm poly(C), and Rho (33 nmol of monomer). The assays were carried out as described (6Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using 200 nm Rho protein monomer. The two different ranges of ribo(C)10 concentrations used depended upon theKm (ribo(C)10) values. A range ribo(C)10 between 0.7 and 20 μm was used for wild-type Rho, whereas a range of ribo(C)10 between 20 and 200 μm was used when the Km indicated a value much greater than the wild-type. Estimates ofKm were reported for values that exceeded 500 μm because of the limited ribo(C)10concentrations that could be used. Transcription termination assays were carried out using a modified trp operon (22Wu A.M. Christie G.E. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as described (6Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, the reaction was carried out in a 10-μl volume with 200 μm ATP, UTP, and GTP and 20 μm CTP, 7 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 0.1 pmol of template, 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor, 0.01 μg/μlE. coli RNA polymerase, and 70 nm Rho protein. Transcription termination was measured in the absence and presence of mutant Rho protein and in the presence of Rho plus 50 μmbicyclomycin. The transcripts were separated and visualized as described (6Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Subtracting the digitized background from both the read through and the Rho-terminated transcripts allowed quantitation of the termination reactions. The background from the wild-type Rho was subtracted from all the mutants and the percentage of termination was calculated as the amount of terminated transcripts divided by the amount of read through transcript plus the amount of terminated transcript times 100. Trp t′ RNA was made using theSalI linearized pTRP5 plasmid and T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction was carried out in 100 μl of transcription buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin), 1 mm each of ATP, GTP, and UTP, and 24 μm CTP, 250 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, and 25 μg of DNA. The reaction was started with 1.4 μg of T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 2 h and another 0.56 μg of enzyme was added and incubated for another 2 h. RNase-free DNase (1 μl) was added and the RNA was purified using a RNeasyTM kit (Qiagen). Purity was determined by urea-PAGE and the RNA concentration was determined byA260. Binding of trp t′ RNA was carried out in binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Binding reaction was started by adding labeled trp t′ RNA to a final concentration of 1.2 nm to Rho varying from 0 to 12 nm (hexamer) and incubating at 25 °C for 10 min, followed by filtration of the binding reaction through an S&S nitrocellulose filter presoaked in 1× binding buffer with 0.1 mg/ml denatured yeast RNA. The filter was washed twice with 0.5 ml of binding buffer, dried briefly, and measured with a scintillation counter (6Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The percent of Rho binding RNA was measured at saturating RNA concentrations from the moles of RNA bound to Rho times the binding efficiency of Rho to the filter (24Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using published procedures (23Witherall G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and used to estimate the concentration of binding-active Rho. The L50 value, the concentration of Rho that gives half-maximal retention of trp t′ RNA was measured using the binding-active Rho concentrations. The Knd and thenth root of Knd was measured as described (24Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of F355W and wild-type Rho was determined using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter at 100 nm Rho monomer in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 450 nm by excitation at 280 nm, and the spectra were compared by zeroing at 300 nm. Studies of RNA-protein interactions show that base stacking, geometric complementarity, and coulombic forces contribute to binding (25Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 26Draper D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A model defining the Rho secondary RNA-binding/RNA-tracking site was proposed based on the symmetry of Rho subunits and the identification of conserved arginine and lysine residues located on the surface of the central hole of the hexameric Rho assembly (18Vincent F. Openshaw M. Trautwein M. Gaskell S.J. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9077-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The notion that RNA tracking occurred through the central hole of Rho was based on RNA cross-linking experiments (17Wei R.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28380-28387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and by homology to known helicases (27Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A technique referred to alanine scanning, which converts selected residues to alanine (glycine), was applied to conserved arginine and lysine residues in the central hole of Rho. The loss of positively charged amino acid residues on Rho function was assessed by comparing the kinetic properties of the mutated Rho protein with wild-type. We included an additional Rho mutant, F355W, in our study to further verify the Rho model. Residue Phe355 was homologous to βTyr331 in E. coliF1-ATP synthase. Residue βTyr331 has been implicated in ATP binding (28Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 27: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and was base stacked with the adenosine moiety of ATP (29Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the replacement of the phenylalanine 355 moiety in Rho with tryptophan provides a potential fluorescence probe sensitive to ATP binding. The plasmid pET-RhoW (19Magyar A. Zhang X. Abdi F. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7316-7324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which expresses wild-type Rho with a N-terminal His tag using a pET14b vector with a T7 RNA polymerase system, was used as a template for introducing site mutations. Table I summarizes the residues changed and the effect change had on mutant protein expression in various expression systems. The mutant proteins were first expressed from pET14b in the hosts BL21(DE3)pLysS or BL21SI (salt-induced host). Of the 15 mutants in which positively charged amino acids were replaced, only R212G, R347G, K348A, and wild-type grew in the salt-induced host expression strain. The induction of R347G and K348A with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in BL21(DE3)pLysS caused a pronounced decrease in the growth of the cells. This observation suggested that these specific Rho mutations had a negative effect on cell growth. The remaining mutations, when introduced into the BL21 strains, generated few, if any, transformants and those that grew produced truncated protein although the plasmid was stable in host JM109 (data not shown).Table ISummary of mutations and protein expressionRhoLocusBase changeExpression systemActivityWild-typepET14b-BL21pLysS+R160AC-terminalCGC to GCCpET14b-λCE6-HMS174−R212GN-terminalCGT to GGTpET14b-BL21pLysS+R238AN-terminalCGC to GCCpET14b-λCE6-HMS174+R269AN-terminalCGT to GCTpET14b-λCE6-HMS174−R272AN-terminalCGC to GCCpET14b-λCE6-HMS174−1-aExpression resulted in the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies.K283EN-terminalCGC to GCCpET14b-λCE6-HMS174−R296AN-terminalCGT to GCTpET14b-λCE6-HMS174+K298AN-terminalAAA to GCApBAD33-MG1655+R299AN-terminalCGC to GCCpBAD33-MG1655+K336AN-terminalAAA to GCApBAD33-MG1655+R347GC-terminalCGT to GGTpET14b-BL21pLysS+K348AC-terminalAAG to GCGpET14b-BL21SI+K352AC-terminalAAA to GCApBAD33-MG1655+R353AC-terminalCGC to GCCpET14b-λCE6-HMS174+R384AC-terminalCGC to GCCpET14b-λCE6-HMS174−1-aExpression resulted in the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies.F355WC-terminalTTC to TGGpET14b-BL21SI+1-a Expression resulted in the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Open table in a new tab Expression from the pBAD33 vector under the arabinose promoter was generally under tighter control (21Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). TheXbaI-HindIII fragment containing the entirerho gene from the pET14b was placed in pBAD33, transformed into host MG1655, and expression was induced by adding 0.2% arabinose. Expression of K352A, K298A, and R299A were obtained using the pBAD33 vector. The remaining mutants either did not grow when pBAD33 was transformed into MG1655 or did not express protein. Transforming vectors into the λ host strain HSM174, which lacked T7 RNA polymerase, and inducing expression with λ phage CE6 accomplished expression of the remaining mutant proteins from pET14b vectors R160A, R238A, R269A, R272A, K283E, R296A, R353A, and R384A. Individual colonies were grown in LB media containing 0.2% maltose and ampicillin to 0.6–1.0 A600. Expression was induced by the addition of 2–4 × 109 plaque-forming units ml−1 λ phage CE6 containing the gene for the T7 RNA polymerase. Three h after infection, cells were harvested, lysed, and Rho-purified using the HiTrap metal chelating column bound with Ni2+. These mutants overexpressed protein; however, R160A, R269A, and K283E exhibited no poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity and R272A and R384A produced inclusion bodies that could not be solubilized. The poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity for the Rho mutants was measured as a function of ATP concentrations (Table II). All of the mutant proteins exhibited a decrease in kcat for ATP hydrolysis when compared with wild-type. Wild-type kcat was 2380 min−1, and only R296A approached this value at 2000 min−1. The other mutants showedkcat values one-half or less of wild-type. Three mutants (R160A, R269A, and K283E) were partially soluble but had no ATP hydrolysis activity. The Km for His-tagged wild-type was ∼5-fold higher than we reported for wild-type Rho (20Park H. Zhang X. Moon H. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This value was consistently observed throughout these experiments. Wild-type Rho exhibited a Km(ATP) of 57 μm, whereas the remaining mutants had either similar (R296A, R299A, K352A, and R353A) or lower (R212G, R347G, and K348A)Km values ranging from 14 to 36 μm, except for K336A, which gave a Km(ATP)of 125 μm. With the exception of R296A and K336A, amino acid changes at these positions did not adversely affect ATP binding but substantially affected ATP hydrolysis.Table IIKinetic paramaters of mutant Rho proteinsRhoPoly(C)-dependent ATPaseRibo(C10)-dependent ATPaseTermination efficienciesKm(ATP)kcatKm(Ribo(C)10)kcatμmmin−1μmmin−1%Wild-type5723809850100R212G1526633343514R238A2516741037R296A542000500111053K298A364445410032R299A5783333315423K336A1251330R347G142085.616141K348A1422228680030K352A5410001000100050R353A425881231297 Open table in a new tab The mutations R347G, K348A, K352A, R353A, and F355W were clustered on or near the H-helix close to the adenosine-binding site for ATP. Mutations R347G, K348A, K352A, and R353A showed a 50–90% loss inkcat for poly(C)-dependent ATP hydrolysis, whereas the Km for ATP was similar to or lower than wild-type. ATP hydrolysis rates are induced by binding RNA at the secondary binding/tracking site (3Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Magyar A.

Biol. 1995; 251: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions that alter RNA binding at the secondary/tracking site were expected to alter the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. RNA activation of ATP hydrolysis activity was determined by varying the ribo(C)10 concentrations in the presence of saturating concentrations of poly(dC) and ATP. Most mutant proteins exhibited decreased kcat values compared with the wild-type value of 850 min−1 (Table II), and the decrease in the kcat for ribo(C)10 activation generally mirrored thekcat values determined in the poly(C)-dependent ATPase assay. Of significance, R296A, K348A, and K352A showed kcat values similar with wild-type. The Km(ribo(C)10) values were sensitive to alanine screening. TheKm(ribo(C)10) for wild-type Rho was 9.0 μm. The K336A mutation showed no detectable poly(dC)-ribo(C)10-stimulated ATP hydrolysis activity, and the poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity was diminished nearly 18-fold. This was the only mutation with a large increase in theKm(ATP), suggesting that Lys336 has a direct role in ATP binding. This finding supports the notion that residues from neighboring subunits can influence ATP binding across the subunit interface (31Vincent F. Widger W.R. Openshaw M. Gaskell S.J. Kohn H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9067-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). By comparison, most of the active mutants exhibited Km(ribo(C)10) values 5–100-fold greater than wild-type Rho, with the only exception being R347G, which had a Km(ribo(C)10) value of 5.6 μm. R296A and K352A stand out as unusual, thekcat for poly(dC)-ribo(C)10-dependent ATP hydrolysis exceeded that of wild-type yet the Km for ribo(C)10 was 500 and 1000 μm, respectively, which was 50–100-fold greater than wild-type Rho. A large increase in the Km(ribo(C)10) coupled with a slight increase in kcat for ATP hydrolysis suggest that the on-rate for ribo(C)10 was lower. To support this notion transcription termination efficiencies should be considerably less for these mutants than for wild-type. In vitro transcription termination reactions were measured using the modified trpoperon fragment (22Wu A.M. Christie G.E. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as reported (6Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fig.1A shows the transcription termination reactions of wild-type Rho, R212G, R296A, K298A, and R299A, which are located at the putative N-terminal locus of the RNA tracking site. Lane 12 shows the run-off transcript (labeledA in Fig. 1A) in the absence of Rho; lane 1 shows the transcripts in the absence of Rho but with the inclusion of 28 μm rifampicin, lane 2 shows transcript produced in the presence of wild-type Rho, and lane 3 shows the effect of 50 μm bicyclomycin on wild-type Rho. Transcription termination efficiencies as a percentage of wild-type Rho for the mutant proteins as depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, are summarized in Table II. Mutant R212G generated only 14% of the terminated transcripts compared with wild-type Rho, whereas mutants R296A, K298A, and R299A generated 53, 32, and 23% terminated transcripts, respectively. The terminated transcripts for the mutants were longer than those seen for wild-type Rho. The terminated transcripts are labeled 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1A. Wild-type Rho produced terminated transcripts dominated by 2 and 3 with a small amount of 1. The mutant Rho proteins predominantly produced the longer terminated transcripts 1 and 2 but little, if any 3, the shortest terminated transcript. The production of longer terminated transcripts was reminiscent of the intermediate-size transcripts seen in the titration of Rho with the antibiotic bicyclomycin (6Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the transcripts generated from bicyclomycin-resistant Rho mutants (6Magyar A.

https://openalex.org/W2324425130,"Cytokine receptors have different signaling requirements which ultimately lead to various physiological responses. In an effort to precisely characterize the molecular determinants involved in the proliferative response mediated by cytokines, we examine dose-dependent proliferation of the betac (GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-5) and homodimeric (G-CSF, TPO) cytokine receptors. Here we report that all cytokine receptors tested activate mostly STAT3 and STAT5. While STAT3 had a positive effect on betac cytokine receptor dependent proliferation, STAT5 was strongly inhibitory. Similarly, G-CSF and TPO lead to activation of STAT3 and STAT5 but, unlike the betac cytokine receptors, both stimulated cellular growth. On the other hand, Ras activation was necessary for all receptor mediated proliferation with the exception of G-CSF R. Truncated mutants of the receptors intracellular domains were used to delineate the functional domains involved in JAK/STAT and Ras activation linked to cellular growth. For instance, we revealed a critical role for the specific alpha subunit of the betac receptors in triggering receptor activation, STAT3 stimulation and proliferation, while Ras activation originates from the distal intracellular portion of the betac subunit. Finally, we showed that proximal STAT activation is the triggering event of G-CSF and TPO receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2330712443,"The protein encoded by the murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) gene inactivates the function of the tumor suppressor p53. The targeted expression of the mdm2 transgene (BLGmdm2) to the mammary epithelium disrupts the cell cycle, causing multiple rounds of DNA synthesis without proper cell division and consequently poor mammary gland development. These phenotypes in the mammary epithelia of the transgenic mice are not dependent on either p53 or the transcription factor E2F1, as mice null for these genes carrying the BLGmdm2 transgene exhibit similar defects to mice carrying the BLGmdm2 transgene alone. p19ARF, an alternative splice product of the INK4a/ARF locus, has been shown to interact directly with MDM2. Therefore, BLGmdm2 transgenic mice null for p19ARF were created to gain insight into the mechanism by which mdm2 overexpression disrupts the cell cycle. The BLGmdm2 phenotype in the absence of p19ARF was worse than BLGmdm2 mice and visible as early as day 15 of pregnancy. By day 5 of lactation the phenotype was very pronounced. Histological analysis of the mammary gland showed a decrease in ductal branching, smaller and fewer lobuloalveolar structures, and a decrease in luminal secretions. Multinucleated and enlarged cells were present due to continued replication in the absence of cytokinesis. Thus, the absence of p19ARF in this in vivo system enhanced the defect caused by mdm2 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2046695763,"Macrophage-derived apoE in the vessel wall has important effects on atherogenesis in vivo, making it important to understand factors that regulate its expression. Vessel wall macrophages are embedded in an extracellular matrix produced largely by arterial smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. In this series of studies, we evaluated the influence of extracellular matrix on macrophage apoE expression. Subendothelial matrix, fibronectin, or collagen I stimulated macrophage apoE gene expression and apoE synthesis. Adhesion of macrophages to a polylysine substrate had no effect. An increase in apoE synthesis after plating on fibronectin could be observed by 2 h and was inhibited by blocking antibodies to the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin receptor for fibronectin. Fibronectin also regulated the post-translational processing of newly synthesized macrophage apoE by inhibiting its degradation. The increment in apoE resulting from suppressed degradation was retained in the cell-fibronectin monolayer in a pool that was resistant to release by exogenous high density lipoprotein subfraction 3. These observations establish a new pathway for the regulation of macrophage apoE expression in the vessel wall. The composition of the extracellular matrix changes after vessel wall injury and in response to locally produced cytokines and growth factors. The evolving composition of this matrix will, therefore, be important for regulating apoE expression and processing by vessel wall macrophages."
