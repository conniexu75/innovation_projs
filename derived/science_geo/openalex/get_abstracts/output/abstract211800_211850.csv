Three types of receptors with maximum absorption in the yellow, green, and violet regions of the spectrum were found. Thus the commonly held belief, for which there has previously been no direct and unequivocal evidence, that color vision is mediated by several kinds of receptors (possibly three), each containing photopigments absorbing in different regions of the spectrum, is confirmed."

https://openalex.org/W2015216308,"Significant genetic differences were demonstrated in the rate of avoidance conditioning among offspring from all 25 mating combinations of 5 highly inbred mouse strains. Hybrids of C3H parents learned fastest, while those of A/JAX parents learned slowest. Most hybrids learned better than either parent. Evidence that differential influences of the early maternal environment affected the rate of learning was not supported."

https://openalex.org/W2035723910,"Subjects instructed to imagine a beating pendulum develop pursuit eye movements of a frequency comparable to the frequency of a previously visualized real pendulum. The appearance of pursuit rather than saccadic movements supports an ""outflow"" theory for central control of eye movement and suggests an objective technique for the identification of certain types of visual imagery."

https://openalex.org/W2016479620,Microsomal RNA from rabbit livers and lymph nodes separate into five major bands during agar-gel electrophoresis. The electrophoretic method may be used either as an analytical or preparative tool. The 33S and 19S peaks of microsomal RNA from sucrose-gradient zone centrifugation divide into two bands each during simple agar electrophoresis.

https://openalex.org/W2025046936,"Ninety-six Vantress broiler chicks were used in two studies of the effects of light and social experience on the ""following"" response. In addition, the animals used in one study were later tested to determine the amount of imprinting during following. The difference between the behavior of these animals and animals maintained in isolation and in darkness prior to exposure to a model, indicate that variability in treatment can influence the following behavior, and that following in itself cannot be equated with imprinting."

The rate of succinate oxidation in liver mitochondria from these animals was 40 percent greater at night. Significant nocturnal increases in the ratio of phosphate to oxygen were obtained with citrate, α-ketoglutarate, and malate."

https://openalex.org/W2132401773,"The incorporation of amino acids into ribonucleic acid associated with cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles has been observed in incubations with intact and cell-free systems from ascitcs cells (1, 2) and cell-free preparations from rat liver (3). Further studies in this laboratory demonstrated that amino acid incorporation into the RNA component of ribonucleoprotein occurs when microsomes or ribosomes are incubated with free 14C-amino acids or aminoacyl sRNA1 in the presence of the appropriate enzyme preparations (4). “Pulse labeling” techniques (2) and time-rate studies (3) suggested that ribosomal RNA may play an intermediary role in amino acid incorporation into proteins. These results and others indicating that the polynucleotide portion of aminoacyl sRNA is reversibly incorporated into ribonucleoprotein (58) are consistent with this suggestion. The incorporation of amino acid or aminoacyl sRNA into ribosomal RNA might therefore represent a stage in the formation of template-bound intermediates in the biological polymerization of amino acids. It appeared important to investigate the nature of the radioactive nonprotein material bound to ribosomes and to determine whether an interaction between aminoacyl sRNA and RNA of the ribosome could be demonstrated. This communication describes studies on the factors required for the formation of ribosomal RNA-bound amino acids, some of the properties of the product or products formed, and their possible participation as particle-bound intermediates in amino acid incorporation. The evidence presented below suggests the existence of a complex involving low molecular weight ribosomal RNA and prptides."

Parameters determined with treated material were the same as those determined with untreated albumin solutions except for slight differences in rotation, the dispersion constant, and in weight-average molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W2128292552,"When a simple luminous figure is viewed in a darkened room, parts of the figure seem to disappear. Usually, the part that fades from view is the part on which the viewer's gaze is centered (fixated). Figure parts which are not fixated seldom disappear independently; they are lost to view only if the entire figure disappears."
https://openalex.org/W2035649686,"During the course of psychoanalytic practice, it has been possible to review with specific patients sequential films taken by their parents, beginning with the earliest weeks of infancy. The photographic evidence, combined with the patient's accompanying verbal associations, sheds additional light on evolving behavioral patterns such as affective expression, communication with others, and motility and its mastery, as well as early social interactions, and serves to correlate with reconstructions made, from psychoanalytic data."
https://openalex.org/W1963750267,"Amino acid incorporation into protein, promoted by synthetic polynucleotides, was studied in a cell-free extract of Alcaligenes faecalis (combined guanine and cytosine content of DNA, 66 percent). In the limited survey, 18 code triplets were found to specify the amino acids as in Escherichia coli (combined guanine and-cytosine content of DNA, 52 percent). At least six of the eight possible triplets containing adenine and uracil were meaningful. No exceptions to the universality of the amino acid code were found."

https://openalex.org/W80690031,"The experiments of Bach and Langley (1) with frog muscle suspensions indicated that the carnosine of this tissue was freely diffusible upon dialysis of homogenates. On the other hand, Reddy and Hegsted (2) observed that the “debris” of rat skeletal muscle homogenates contained 43% of the total carnosine. This debris, representing material sedimented at 650 x g, still retained half of its initial carnosine content after extraction for 7 days in 50% glycerol at -10”. Mitochondria were found to contain over 7% of the total muscle carnosine, and this dipeptide was not removed by suspension of the granules in isotonic sucrose. Reddy and Hegsted concluded that bound carnosine was present within the muscle cell, although it was not clear whether the peptide was attached to myofibrils or whether the microsomes retained any of the carnosine. No results were reported for anserine, the more abundant of the two muscle dipeptides. Inasmuch as a selective binding of carnosine to subcellular components of muscle might offer a clue to the physiological role of this enigmatic peptide, it seemed desirable to further study the intracellular distribution of carnosine, and of anserine as well, in skeletal muscle tissue. We have not been able to confirm the conclusions of Reddy and Hegsted that relatively large concentrations of carnosine are associated with subcellular fractions of rat gastrocnemius muscle. However, by employing more sensitive isotopic labeling methods, it has been possible to demonstrate the retention of very small quantities of carnosine and anserine in certain cellular components of chick pectoral muscle. This tissue was chosen because of its unusually high dipeptide content (3). In addition to normal birds, experiments were performed with genetically dyst,rophic chicks."

https://openalex.org/W2075373334,"Arousal outside the test situation and prior to response acquisition can affect strength of imprinting, if such treatment occurs early enough in life. Young chicks handled in darkness either at 5 or 9 hours of age and exposed to a moving surrogate a number of hours later were compated with nonhandled controls by means of following tests given at 30 and 54 hours of age. Handling at 5 hours resulted in a significant increment in the later following response. Handling at 9 hours produced no effect."

This family constituted a test cross for six characters: sex, peanut reactivity, silky feathering, and the three independent species-specific blood characters, hu-1, hu-4, and hu-8."
