https://openalex.org/W2262698336,"In the United States, there are persistent and widening socioeconomic gaps in morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases. Although most disparities research focuses on person-level socioeconomic-status, mounting evidence suggest that chronic diseases also pattern by the demographic characteristics of neighborhoods. Yet the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. There is increasing recognition that chronic diseases share common pathogenic features, some of which involve alterations in the composition, diversity, and functioning of the gut microbiota. This study examined whether socioeconomic-status was associated with alpha-diversity of the colonic microbiota. Forty-four healthy adults underwent un-prepped sigmoidoscopy, during which mucosal biopsies and fecal samples were collected. Subjects' zip codes were geocoded, and census data was used to form a composite indicator of neighborhood socioeconomic-status, reflecting household income, educational attainment, employment status, and home value. In unadjusted analyses, neighborhood socioeconomic-status explained 12-18 percent of the variability in alpha-diversity of colonic microbiota. The direction of these associations was positive, meaning that as neighborhood socioeconomic-status increased, so did alpha-diversity of both the colonic sigmoid mucosa and fecal microbiota. The strength of these associations persisted when models were expanded to include covariates reflecting potential demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and lifestyle (adiposity, alcohol use, smoking) confounds. In these models neighborhood socioeconomic-status continued to explain 11-22 percent of the variability in diversity indicators. Further analyses suggested these patterns reflected socioeconomic variations in evenness, but not richness, of microbial communities residing in the sigmoid. We also found indications that residence in neighborhoods of higher socioeconomic-status was associated with a greater abundance of Bacteroides and a lower abundance of Prevotella, suggesting that diet potentially underlies differences in microbiota composition. These findings suggest the presence of socioeconomic variations in colonic microbiota diversity. Future research should explore whether these variations contribute to disparities in chronic disease outcomes."

In the adult mouse brain, three Tau isoforms are expressed that contain either 0, 1, or 2 N-terminal inserts (0N, 1N, and 2N). We generated Tau isoform-specific antibodies and performed co-immunoprecipitations followed by tandem mass tag multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified novel Tau-interacting proteins of which one-half comprised membrane-bound proteins, localized to the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and other organelles. Tau was also found to interact with proteins involved in presynaptic signal transduction. MetaCore analysis revealed one major Tau interaction cluster that contained 33 Tau pulldown proteins. To explore the pathways in which these proteins are involved, we conducted an ingenuity pathway analysis that revealed two significant overlapping pathways, “cell-to-cell signaling and interaction” and “neurological disease.” The functional enrichment tool DAVID showed that in particular the 2N Tau-interacting proteins were specifically associated with neurological disease. Finally, for a subset of Tau interactions (apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), apoE, mitochondrial creatine kinase U-type, β-synuclein, synaptogyrin-3, synaptophysin, syntaxin 1B, synaptotagmin, and synapsin 1), we performed reverse co-immunoprecipitations, confirming the preferential interaction of specific isoforms. For example, apoA1 displayed a 5-fold preference for the interaction with 2N, whereas β-synuclein showed preference for 0N. Remarkably, a reverse immunoprecipitation with apoA1 detected only the 2N isoform. This highlights distinct protein interactions of the different Tau isoforms, suggesting that they execute different functions in brain tissue.

Sirtuins are class III histone deacylases that use NAD+ as a co-substrate during amide bond hydrolysis. Several studies have described the sirtuins as sensors of the NAD+/NADH ratio, but it has not been formally tested for all the mammalian sirtuins in vitro. To address this problem, we first synthesized a wide variety of peptide-based probes, which were used to identify the range of hydrolytic activities of human sirtuins. These probes included aliphatic ϵ-N-acyllysine modifications with hydrocarbon lengths ranging from formyl (C1) to palmitoyl (C16) as well as negatively charged dicarboxyl-derived modifications. In addition to the well established activities of the sirtuins, “long chain” acyllysine modifications were also shown to be prone to hydrolytic cleavage by SIRT1–3 and SIRT6, supporting recent findings. We then tested the ability of NADH, ADP-ribose, and nicotinamide to inhibit these NAD+-dependent deacylase activities of the sirtuins. In the commonly used 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-coupled fluorescence-based assay, the fluorophore has significant spectral overlap with NADH and therefore cannot be used to measure inhibition by NADH. Therefore, we turned to an HPLC-MS-based assay to directly monitor the conversion of acylated peptides to their deacylated forms. All tested sirtuin deacylase activities showed sensitivity to NADH in this assay. However, the inhibitory concentrations of NADH in these assays are far greater than the predicted concentrations of NADH in cells; therefore, our data indicate that NADH is unlikely to inhibit sirtuins in vivo. These data suggest a re-evaluation of the sirtuins as direct sensors of the NAD+/NADH ratio.

However, the sensitivity of the latest list of reported mammalian sirtuin deacylation reactions to NADH has not been formally tested. To do this, we first had to establish the full array of sirtuin-mediated lysine deacylation reactions in our assays. Given that there is such a large variety of reported sirtuin activities and that in some cases these reports are conflicting, it was imperative that we perform a comprehensive analysis to confirm previously reported sirtuin activities in our assays. Thus, we first established a range of sirtuin-mediated lysine deacylation reactions using three different in vitro assays. We then tested the sensitivity of a selection of these reactions to NADH. The data presented here have important implications for the fundamental understanding of sirtuin activity as well as the wide scope of biology they regulate. SIRT1 (aa 193–741 with N-terminal GST tag, >60% purity), SIRT2 (aa 50–356 with C-terminal His tag, >90% purity), SIRT4 (aa 25–314 with N-terminal GST tag, >70% purity), SIRT5 (full-length with N-terminal GST tag, >57% purity), SIRT6 (full-length with N-terminal GST tag, >64% purity), SIRT7 (full length with C-terminal FLAG tag, >50% purity) HDAC1 (full-length with C-terminal His tag and C-terminal FLAG tag, >62% purity), HDAC2 (full-length with C-terminal His tag, >86% purity), HDAC3·NCoR2 (full-length HDAC3 with C-terminal His tag in complex with NCoR2 (aa 395–489) with N-terminal GST-tag, >90% purity), HDAC4 (aa 627–1085 with C-terminal GST tag, >89% purity), HDAC5 (aa 657–1123 with C-terminal His tag, >90% purity, HDAC8 (full-length with C-terminal His tag, >90% purity), and HDAC9 (aa 604–1066 with C-terminal His tag, >76% purity) were purchased from BPS Biosciences (San Diego, CA); HDAC7 (aa 383–end with N-terminal His tag, >50% purity) was purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA); SIRT3 (aa 101–399 with N-terminal His tag; >90% purity) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); SIRT5 (aa 37–310 with N-terminal His tag, >90% purity) was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). Purities were based on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining according to the supplier, and all enzyme concentrations given are based on stock concentrations according to the supplier. Assay buffer was prepared as described in the Biomol International product sheets BML-KI-143 (Tris/Cl (50 mm), NaCl (137 mm), KCl (2.7 mm), MgCl2 (1 mm), pH 8.0) with or without the addition of BSA (1.0 mg/ml) for fluorescence and HPLC-MS experiments, respectively. Trypsin (10,000 units/mg, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated from bovine pancreas, T1426) was from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). NADH (as a hydrate of the disodium salt, N8129) was from Sigma-Aldrich, and the stock solution (250 mm, in degassed MilliQ water) was prepared based on the absorbance at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6220 m−1·cm−1). All chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification as obtained from commercial suppliers. Fluorogenic substrate series 1–3 were synthesized using a combination of solution-phase and solid-phase peptide synthesis (see the supplemental information and Fig. 1A for details). Octamer and dodecamer substrate series 4 and 5 were prepared by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis on Chem-Matrix® resin with a Rink amide linker using HATU as the coupling reagent. Compounds 4i and 4j were prepared by HATU-mediated acylation of the unprotected peptide (4n) with myristic acid and palmitic acid, respectively, to give the desired substrates as the major products. Compound 5i was prepared by HATU-mediated acylation of the resin-bound, appropriately protected peptide with myristic acid, and compounds 5p and 5q were synthesized by acylation of the resin-bound, appropriately protected peptide with the desired anhydride. All reactions were performed in black low binding 96-well microtiter plates (Corning half-area wells), with duplicate series in each assay, and each assay was performed at least twice. Control wells without enzyme were included in each plate. All reactions were performed in assay buffer, with appropriate concentrations of substrates and inhibitors obtained by dilution from 10–250 mm stock solutions in either water or DMSO and an appropriate concentration of enzyme obtained by dilution of the stock provided by the supplier. All plates were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Enspire plate reader with excitation at 360 nm and detecting emission at 460 nm. Fluorescence measurements (relative fluorescence units) were converted to [AMC] concentrations based on an [AMC]-fluorescence standard curve, and all data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. The initial screening for substrate deacylation activity was performed with end point fluorophore cleavage by trypsin. For a final volume of 25 μl/well, acyl substrates (Ac-TARKacyl-AMC (1a–m) or Ac-QPKKacyl-AMC (2a–k) 50 μm) and NAD+ (500 μm) were added to each well, followed by a solution of sirtuin enzyme (SIRT1, 333 nm; SIRT2, 222 nm; SIRT3, 250 nm; SIRT4, 270 nm; SIRT5, 211 nm; SIRT6, 313 nm; SIRT7, 400 nm). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and then 25 μl of a solution of trypsin and nicotinamide (5.0 mg/ml and 4 mm, respectively; final concentration 2.5 mg/ml and 2 mm, respectively) was added, and the assay development was allowed to proceed for 90 min at room temperature before fluorescence analysis. The data were analyzed to afford [AMC] relative to control wells. The screening for substrate deacylation activity was performed with end point fluorophore cleavage by trypsin. For a final volume of 25 μl/well, acyl substrate (Ac-QPKKacyl-AMC (2a–k) (10 μm)) was added, followed by a solution of HDAC enzyme (10 nm). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, after which a solution of trypsin (25 μl, 5.0 mg/ml, final concentration 2.5 mg/ml) was added, and the assay development was allowed to proceed for 90 min at room temperature before fluorescence analysis. The data were analyzed to afford [AMC] relative to control wells. Using the protocol described above with a 30-min reaction time, hydrolase activities of SIRT1–3 and SIRT6 against substrates 1f, 1i, and 3b and SIRT5 against 3p and 3q were evaluated under varying ADPR or NAM concentrations. The sirtuin enzyme (SIRT1, 100 nm; SIRT2, 400 μm; SIRT3, 300 nm; SIRT6, 600 nm; or SIRT5, 200 nm) was incubated with the relevant substrate (300 μm), NAD+ (1000 μm), and ADPR or NAM (1–0.064 mm in a 5-fold dilution series, or 0.0 mm) in a total volume of 25 μl of assay buffer. The data were fitted to the concentration-response equation (Hill slope = −1) using GraphPad Prism. All reactions were performed in black low binding 96-well microtiter plates (Corning half-area wells), with each assay performed at least twice. After incubating sirtuin, substrates, and inhibitor (when applicable) for 30 min at 37 °C, a sample of the reaction mixture (10 μl) was taken out and quenched by the addition of buffer/MeOH/HCOOH (50:96:4, 30 μl). The samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS on a Waters Acquity ultra-HPLC-MS system equipped with a diode array detector. A gradient with eluent I (0.1% HCOOH in water (v/v)) and eluent II (0.1% HCOOH in acetonitrile (v/v)) rising linearly 0–10% during t = 0.00–2.10 min followed by 10–60% of eluent II during t = 2.10–4.30 min was applied at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The obtained chromatograms at either 280 nm (where the indole chromophore of tryptophan of substrate series 5 has its absorption maximum) or 326 nm (where the coumarin moiety of substrate series 1 and 3 has its absorption maximum) were used to determine reaction progression, by determining area under the curve of the relevant peaks using Waters MassLynx. The hydrolase activities of SIRT1–3 against substrate 5b, SIRT1–3 and -6 against substrate 5i, and SIRT5 against substrates 5p and 5q were evaluated. Sirtuin enzyme (SIRT1, 50 nm for 5b and 100 nm for 5i; SIRT2, 200 nm for 5b and 5i; SIRT3, 400 nm for 5b and 600 nm for 5i; SIRT5, 400 nm for 5p and 5q; and SIRT6, 6.00 μm for 5i) was incubated with the relevant dodecapeptide substrate (100 μm), NAD+ (500 μm), and NADH (0.0, 0.5, 5.0, or 50 mm) in a total volume of 25 μl of assay buffer. Using the protocol described above, hydrolase activities of SIRT1–3 against substrates 1f, 1i, and 3b and SIRT5 against 3p and 3q were evaluated under varying NADH concentrations. The sirtuin enzyme (SIRT1, 400 nm; SIRT2, 2.00 μm; SIRT3, 2.76 μm; SIRT6, 1.88 μm; or SIRT5, 200 nm) was incubated with the relevant substrate (300 μm (SIRT1–3 and SIRT6) or 100 μm (SIRT5)), NAD+ (1000 μm (SIRT1–3 and SIRT6) or 500 μm (SIRT5), and NADH (10–0.01 mm in a 3.16-fold dilution series, or 0.0 mm) in a total volume of 25 μl of assay buffer. The data were fitted to the concentration-response equation (Hill slope = −1) using GraphPad Prism. Using the protocol described above, hydrolase activities of SIRT1 against substrate 3b and SIRT5 against substrate 3p were determined under varying substrate-NADH and NAD+-NADH concentrations. Sirtuin enzyme (SIRT1, 400 nm; SIRT5, 650 nm) was incubated with substrate (3b (400–12.5 μm, 2-fold dilution or 300 μm) or 3p (400–12.5 μm, 2-fold dilution or 100 μm)), NAD+ (500 μm or 5.0–0.156 mm, 2-fold dilution), and NADH (10–0.156 mm, 2-fold dilution or 0.0 mm). The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism. Double-reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plots were constructed by fitting the obtained data to a series of first order equations with shared intersection using GraphPad Prism"
https://openalex.org/W2266546441,"Survivors of sepsis often experience long-term cognitive and functional decline. Previous studies utilizing lipopolysaccharide injection and cecal ligation and puncture in rodent models of sepsis have demonstrated changes in depressive-like behavior and learning and memory after sepsis, as well as evidence of myeloid inflammation and cytokine expression in the brain, but the long-term course of neuroinflammation after sepsis remains unclear. Here, we utilize cecal ligation and puncture with greater than 80% survival as a model of sepsis. We found that sepsis survivor mice demonstrate deficits in extinction of conditioned fear, but no acquisition of fear conditioning, nearly two months after sepsis. These cognitive changes occur in the absence of neuronal loss or changes in synaptic density in the hippocampus. Sepsis also resulted in infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils into the CNS at least two weeks after sepsis in a CCR2 independent manner. Cellular inflammation is accompanied by long-term expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes, including TNFα and CCR2 ligands, in whole brain homogenates. Gene expression analysis of microglia revealed that while microglia do express anti-microbial genes and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules of the S100A family of genes at least 2 weeks after sepsis, they do not express the cytokines observed in whole brain homogenates. Our results indicate that in a naturalistic model of infection, sepsis results in long-term neuroinflammation, and that this sustained inflammation is likely due to interactions among multiple cell types, including resident microglia and peripherally derived myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2271742164,"The sutures of the skulls of vertebrates are generally open early in life and slowly close as maturity is attained. The assumption that all vertebrates follow this pattern of progressive sutural closure has been used to assess maturity in the fossil remains of non-avian dinosaurs. Here, we test this assumption in two members of the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket of the Dinosauria, the emu, Dromaius novaehollandiae and the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, by investigating the sequence and timing of sutural fusion in their skulls. As expected, almost all the sutures in the emu skull progressively close (i.e., they get narrower) and then obliterate during ontogeny. However, in the American alligator, only two sutures out of 36 obliterate completely and they do so during embryonic development. Surprisingly, as maturity progresses, many sutures of alligators become wider in large individuals compared to younger, smaller individuals. Histological and histomorphometric analyses on two sutures and one synchondrosis in an ontogenetic series of American alligator confirmed our morphological observations. This pattern of sutural widening might reflect feeding biomechanics and dietary changes through ontogeny. Our findings show that progressive sutural closure is not always observed in extant archosaurs, and therefore suggest that cranial sutural fusion is an ambiguous proxy for assessing maturity in non-avian dinosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2254047222,"Background Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality of HIV/AIDS patients but has also been associated with increased metabolic complications and cardiovascular diseases. Data on the association between HAART and hypertension (HTN) in Africa are scarce. Objectives Primarily to compare the prevalence of HTN in HIV/AIDS patients on HAART and HAART-naïve patients in Limbe, Cameroon; and secondarily to assess other socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with HTN in this population. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Limbe Regional Hospital HIV treatment center between April and June 2013, involving 200 HIV/AIDS patients (100 on first-line HAART regimens for at least 12 months matched by age and sex to 100 HAART-naïve patients). HTN was defined as a systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg. Results The prevalence of HTN in patients on HAART was twice (38%; 95% CI: 28.5–48.3) that of the HAART-naïve patients (19%; 95% CI, 11.8–28.1), p = 0.003. In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, gender, smoking, family history of HTN, and BMI-defined overweight, HAART was associated with HTN, the adjusted odds ratio of the HAART-treated versus HAART-naïve group was 2.20 (95% CI: 1.07–4.52), p = 0.032. HTN was associated with older age and male gender, in the HAART group and with BMI-defined overweight in the HAART-naïve group. Conclusion The prevalence of hypertension in HIV/AIDS patients in Limbe stands out to be elevated, higher in patients on HAART compared to those not on treatment. Blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors should be routinely monitored. Other factors such as diet, weight control and physical exercise should also be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2262672961,"This study proposes a vision model for individual colorimetric observers. The proposed model can be beneficial in many color-critical applications such as color grading and soft proofing to assess ranges of color matches instead of a single average match. We extended the CIE 2006 physiological observer by adding eight additional physiological parameters to model individual color-normal observers. These eight parameters control lens pigment density, macular pigment density, optical densities of L-, M-, and S-cone photopigments, and λmax shifts of L-, M-, and S-cone photopigments. By identifying the variability of each physiological parameter, the model can simulate color matching functions among color-normal populations using Monte Carlo simulation. The variabilities of the eight parameters were identified through two steps. In the first step, extensive reviews of past studies were performed for each of the eight physiological parameters. In the second step, the obtained variabilities were scaled to fit a color matching dataset. The model was validated using three different datasets: traditional color matching, applied color matching, and Rayleigh matches."
https://openalex.org/W2264596790,"Within the family of NADPH oxidases, NOX4 is unique as it is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, has constitutive activity, and generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We hypothesize that these features are consequences of a so far unidentified NOX4-interacting protein. Two-dimensional blue native (BN) electrophorese combined with SDS-PAGE yielded NOX4 to reside in macromolecular complexes. Interacting proteins were screened by quantitative SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture) co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) in HEK293 cells stably overexpressing NOX4. By this technique, several interacting proteins were identified with calnexin showing the most robust interaction. Calnexin also resided in NOX4-containing complexes as demonstrated by complexome profiling from BN-PAGE. The calnexin NOX4 interaction could be confirmed by reverse Co-IP and proximity ligation assay, whereas NOX1, NOX2, or NOX5 did not interact with calnexin. Calnexin deficiency as studied in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from calnexin−/− mice or in response to calnexin shRNA reduced cellular NOX4 protein expression and reactive oxygen species formation. Our results suggest that endogenous NOX4 forms macromolecular complexes with calnexin, which are needed for the proper maturation, processing, and function of NOX4 in the endoplasmic reticulum.

In mammals, seven homologues are expressed that can be grouped according to their mode of activation. NOX1, NOX2, and NOX3 are mainly activated by protein-protein interaction with cytosolic proteins, NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2 (Dual oxidase 1 and 2) are calcium-dependent, whereas NOX4 is constitutively active. The lack of activity control for NOX4 is enigmatic given the potential harmful effects of excessive ROS production. It is therefore believed that NOX4-dependent ROS production is largely controlled through the abundance of the enzyme (1.Brandes R.P. Weissmann N. Schröder K. Nox family NADPH oxidases: molecular mechanisms of activation.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2014; 76: 208-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Indeed, certain conditions like hypoxia or the stimulation with transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) are known to strongly induce NOX4 in fibroblasts or epithelial cells (2.Bondi C.D. Manickam N.

On the other hand, fairly high mRNA levels for Nox4 are detected in almost all differentiated tissues, but protein expression by Western blot analysis is readily detectable only in a few tissues, such as in the kidney, lung, and also the endothelium (4.Geiszt M.

Furthermore, a potential explanation for missing oxidative stress but constitutive expressed NOX4 is that NOX4 produces predominantly H2O2 rather than O2̇̄ as do NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, and NOX5 (7.Takac I.

The latter aspect has long been debated, with numerous subcellular locations such as the plasma membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) being associated with NOX4 (10.Helmcke I.

This controversy is obviously fueled by the difficulties in detecting the NOX4 protein, by problems with antibody specificity and the potential that NOX4 might shuttle between compartments. It is understandable that the ER is a site of NOX4 expression as being a membrane protein, NOX4 has to be synthesized and folded in the ER. Other locations, like the nucleus (12.Anilkumar N.

Given the differences in NOX4 protein expression and the different locations as well as a certain conceptual desire to identify mechanisms of direct activity control, NOX4 interacting proteins could be postulated. For the DUOX enzymes, for example, maturating factors are required to achieve sufficient expression and activity; on the other hand the interaction with p22phox is required for NOX2 to stabilize the protein and to allow maturation (15.Zhu Y.

On the basis of these findings we hypothesized that additional so far unidentified NOX4 interacting proteins may exist. We therefore employed a NOX4 overexpression system to screen for potential interactors, which were subsequently validated in a desire to determine the functional importance in primary cells.

MEFs were isolated from wild type (wt) and calnexin-knock-out (Canx−/−) mice as described before (20.Coe H. Bedard K. Groenendyk J. Jung J. Michalak M. Endoplasmic reticulum stress in the absence of calnexin.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2008; 13: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and provided by one of the co-authors (M.M.) (20.Coe H.

Cells were cultured in DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX (Gibco) supplemented with 8% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37 °C). Primary podocytes were isolated as described (21.Babelova A. Jansen F. Sander K. Löhn M. Schäfer L. Fork C. Ruetten H. Plettenburg O. Stark H. Daniel C. Amann K. Pavenstädt H. Jung O. Brandes R.P.

Briefly, transcardiac perfusion was performed with 8 × 107 Dynabeads M450, tosyl-activated (Invitrogen), and suspended in podocyte growth medium (RPMI 1640 (Gibco), 8% FCS, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1% non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.01 mg/ml of insulin/transferrin/sodium seletine solution, penicillin/streptomycin). Mouse kidneys were minced into 1-mm3 pieces. These were digested with 1 mg/ml of collagenase A (Roche Applied Science) in podocyte growth medium (37 °C, 30 min) and afterward pressed twice through two 100-μm cell strainers using a flattened pestle. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of podocyte growth medium. Glomeruli containing Dynabeads were isolated by a magnetic particle concentrator and washed with podocyte growth medium. Eventually glomeruli of three each of wt or Nox4−/− mice were combined and cultured in podocyte medium in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37 °C). For labeling of HEK293 cells with isotopic amino acids, cells were grown in DMEM without lysine, arginine, and glutamine (280001200, SILANTES), supplemented with 8% dialyzed FCS, l-glutamine (2 mm), l-proline (200 mg/liter), glucose (4.5 g/liter), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 mg/liter of [13C]arginine and [13C,15N]lysine (heavy; H*) or [12C,14N]arginine and [12C,14N]lysine (light; L) in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37 °C) to ensure total incorporation of labeled amino acids. Heavy amino acid labeling was checked after 14 days cell culture. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 0.75 μg/ml of DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells stably expressing NOX1 (NOX1-HEK293) or NOX4 (NOX4-HEK293) were generated as described before using lentiviral transfection and selection (10.Helmcke I. Heumüller S. Tikkanen R.

Signal. 2009; 11: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For lentiviral knockdown, two different shRNA were purchased from Sigma (sh1, TRCN0000278234; sh2, TRCN0000278235). As controls scrambled shRNA (Addgene number 1864) and GFP shRNA (Addgene number 30323) from David Sabatini were used. The controls as well as the packing plasmid (Addgene number 12260) and envelope plasmid (Addgene number 12259) were a gift from Didier Trono. Transfection and transduction were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293 cells were selected for at least 7 days with 2 μg/ml of puromycin after transduction. ROS production was measured as described before (23.Rezende F. Löwe O. Helfinger V. Prior K.-K. Walter M. Zukunft S. Fleming I. Weissmann N. Brandes R.P. Schröder K.

Redox Signal. 2016; 24: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As probe, luminol (100 μm, Sigma) catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 1 units/ml, Sigma) or L012 (250 μm, Wako) was used and measured in a Berthold 6-channel luminometer (LB9505, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) or TriStar2 Multimode Reader (LB942, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). H2O2 formation was also measured with the Amplex Red assay (50 μm, Invitrogen; HRP, 2 units/ml, Sigma) as previously described (23.Rezende F. Löwe O. Helfinger V. Prior K.-K. Walter M. Zukunft S.

Redox Signal. 2016; 24: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In some experiments cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech) for 24 h to induce NOX4. To block NOX activity, diphenylene iodonium (10 μm, Sigma) was added for 1 h. Respective fluorescence was determined in a microplate fluorimeter (excitation 530 nm, emission 590 nm). Protein amount was determined by Bradford protein assay and used for Western blot analysis. HEK293 cells were mechanically homogenized in homogenization (HM) buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm orthovanadate, 10 nm okadaic acid, protein-inhibitor mixture, 40 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) using a pre-cooled motor-driven glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer at 2000 rpm and 40 strokes. Subcellular components were separated by differential centrifugation at 4 °C at 3,000 × g for 10 min, 9,000 × g for 20 min, and 15,000 × g for 30 min to gain a pellet and supernatant. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of HM buffer containing protease inhibitors and used for the protein amount determination by Bradford assay and subsequently for Western blot analysis or membranes were spun down at 100,000 × g for 15 min (4 °C) and used for blue native electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation of HSPA5 (Santa Cruz, number sc-1051), CANX (Merck Millipore, number MAB3126), or GFP (Roche, number 11814460001) HEK293 cells were lysed in Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, buffered with 1% Triton or digitonin containing protease inhibitors as described above. Supernatant was incubated with appropriate antibody (2 μg) for at least 90 min at 4 °C followed by incubation for an additional 90 min with Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Beads were washed with lysis buffer three times, incubated for 5 min at 95 °C with Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For quantitative SILAC-based NOX4-Co-IP (qCo-IP) HEK293 cells were grown in normal or heavy labeled SILAC medium (100 mg/liter of [13C]arginine/[13C,15N]lysine or [12C,14N]arginine/[12C,14N]lysine), lysed with either Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, buffered 1% digitonin or for total membrane preparation the cells were harvested in HM buffer, nuclei were removed (3,000 × g for 10 min), and 100,000 × g total membrane (20 min, 4 °C) pellets were solubilized with digitonin (6 g/g of protein) in solubilization buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were used for NOX4 qCo-IP with magnetic protein G bead (Invitrogen) analogs to normal Co-IP as described. Additionally, the NOX4 antibody (24.Anilkumar N. Weber R. Zhang M. Brewer A.

Light and heavy labeled samples were combined and analyzed in SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as well as mass spectrometry. 15,000 × g membrane pellets from the differential centrifugation containing 200 μg of protein were resuspended in 20 μl of buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm aminocaproic acid) and solubilized with detergent/protein ratios of 6 or 12 g/g with digitonin (Serva), 2.5 or 5 g/g of n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside (Glycon, Luckenwalde), and 3 or 6 g/g of Triton X-100 (Sigma). Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 22,000 × g and the supernantant was supplemented with 2.5 μl of 50% glycerol and 3 μl of Coomassie dye solution (5% Serva Blue G250, 500 mm aminocaproic acid). Samples were loaded onto 3 to 18% acrylamide gradient gels following blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) as described previously (25.Wittig I. Braun H.-P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE gels were either used for native Western blotting (25.Wittig I. Braun H.-P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar) or used for second dimension separation or complexome profiling (26.Heide H. Bleier L. Steger M.

For separation in a second, denaturing dimension (two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE), lanes were cut and separated in Tricine-SDS-PAGE with 10% acrylamide. They were silver stained or used for Western blot as previously described (27.Schägger H. Tricine-SDS-PAGE.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Blue native gels were fixed in 50% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 10 mm ammonium acetate for 30 min and stained with Coomassie (0.025% Serva Blue G, 10% (v/v) acetic acid) (25.Wittig I. Braun H.-P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Each lane was cut into 40 equal fractions and collected in 96-well filter plates (30–40 μm PP/PE, Pall Corporation). The gel pieces were destained in 60% methanol, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Solutions were removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 600 × g. Proteins were reduced in 10 mm DTT, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 56 °C and alkylated for 45 min in 30 mm iodoacteamide. Samples were digested for 16 h with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.01% Protease Max (Promega), and 1 mm CaCl2. Peptides were eluted in 30% acetonitrile and 3% formic acid, centrifuged into a fresh 96-well plate, dried in a speed vacuum, and resolved in 1% acetonitrile and 0.5% formic acid (26.Heide H.

Gel lanes of the combined light and heavy labeled samples were cut into 8 slices. SDS gel was fixed in 50% (v/v) methanol, stained with Coomassie Blue, and digested with trypsin as described in the complexome profiling sample preparation above. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was performed on a Thermo ScientificTM Q Exactive Plus coupled to an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography unit (Thermo Scientific Dionex Ultimate 3000) via a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were loaded on a C18 reversed-phase precolumn (Zorbax 300SB-C18, Agilent Technologies) followed by separation on an in-house packed 2.2-μm Reprosil Gold C18 resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH) picotip emitter tip (diameter 75 μm, 12 cm long, New Objectives) using a gradient from mobile phase A (4% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 45% mobile phase B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for 60 min with a flow rate of 250 nl/min. MS data were recorded by data-dependent Top10 acquisition (selecting the 10 most abundant precursor ions in positive mode for high energy collision dissociation fragmentation). The full MS scan range was 250 to 2,000 m/z with a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200. Only higher charged ions (2+) were selected for MS/MS scans with a resolution of 17,500. MS data were analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) (28.Cox J. Mann M.

The enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, missed cleavages were limited to 2 and the minimum peptide length was seven amino acids. The following variable modifications were selected: at N terminus acetylation (+42.01), oxidation of methionine (+15.99), deamidation on asparagine and glutamine (−0.98), and carbamidomethylation (+57.02) on cysteines. False discovery rate for protein and peptides was 1% (supplemental Table S1), which includes peptide and protein identification, accession numbers, protein and gene names, sequence coverage of each sample or gel slice, scores, and normalized SILAC ratios. Identifications from the reverse decoy database, by site and known contaminants were excluded. Further data analysis and scatter plots were generated by Perseus (version 1.5.1.6). Proteins with a log2 ratio >0.5 were considered as protein of interest.

https://openalex.org/W2279553170,"In zebrafish developmentally exposed to ambient ethanol (20mM-50mM) 1-9 days post fertilization (dpf), the cortisol response to stress has been shown to be significantly attenuated in larvae, juveniles and 6 month old adults. These data are somewhat at variance with similar studies in mammals, which often show heightened stress responses. To test whether these cortisol data correlate with behavioural changes in treated animals, anxiety-like behaviour of zebrafish larvae (9dpf and 10dpf) and juveniles (23dpf) was tested in locomotor assays designed to this end. In open field tests treated animals were more exploratory, spending significantly less time at the periphery of the arena. Behavioural effects of developmental exposure to ethanol were sustained in 6-month-old adults, as judged by assessment of thigmotaxis, novel tank diving and scototaxis. Like larvae and juveniles, developmentally treated adults were generally more exploratory, and spent less time at the periphery of the arena in thigmotaxis tests, less time at the bottom of the tank in the novel tank diving tests, and less time in the dark area in scototaxis tests. The conclusion that ethanol-exposed animals showed less anxiety-like behaviour was validated by comparison with the effects of diazepam treatment, which in thigmotaxis and novel tank diving tests had similar effects to ethanol pretreatment. There is thus a possible link between the hypophyseal-pituitary-interrenal axis and the behavioural actions of developmental ethanol exposure. The mechanisms require further elucidation."
https://openalex.org/W2261868277,"The rate of photosynthesis (A) of plants exposed to water deficit is a function of stomatal (gs) and mesophyll (gm) conductance determining the availability of CO2 at the site of carboxylation within the chloroplast. Mesophyll conductance often represents the greatest impediment to photosynthetic uptake of CO2, and a crucial determinant of the photosynthetic effects of drought. Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a fundamental role in signalling and co-ordination of plant responses to drought; however, the effect of ABA on gm is not well-defined. Rose, cherry, olive and poplar were exposed to exogenous ABA and their leaf gas exchange parameters recorded over a four hour period. Application with ABA induced reductions in values of A, gs and gm in all four species. Reduced gm occurred within one hour of ABA treatment in three of the four analysed species; indicating that the effect of ABA on gm occurs on a shorter timescale than previously considered. These declines in gm values associated with ABA were not the result of physical changes in leaf properties due to altered turgor affecting movement of CO2, or caused by a reduction in the sub-stomatal concentration of CO2 (Ci). Increased [ABA] likely induces biochemical changes in the properties of the interface between the sub-stomatal air-space and mesophyll layer through the actions of cooporins to regulate the transport of CO2. The results of this study provide further evidence that gm is highly responsive to fluctuations in the external environment, and stress signals such as ABA induce co-ordinated modifications of both gs and gm in the regulation of photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2265585098,"Estimate the prevalence of functional dentition among Brazilian adults using four different definitions and identify associated factors.A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 9564 Brazilian adults aged 35-44 years who participated in the 2010 National Oral Health Survey. Data collection involved oral examinations and the administration of questionnaires. The following definitions were used: 1-WHO Functional Dentition (FDWHO: ≥ 20 teeth present); 2-well-distributed teeth (WDT: ≥ 10 teeth in each arch); 3 -Functional dentition classified by esthetics and occlusion (FDClass5: dentitions that sequentially exhibit at least one tooth in each arch, at least 10 teeth in each arch, all maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth, three or four premolar posterior occluding pairs [POPs], and at least one molar POP bilaterally); 4-Functional dentition classified by esthetics, occlusion and periodontal status (FDClass6: corresponds to FDClass5 with the addition of periodontal status of all sextants in the oral cavity with, at most, shallow pockets and/or clinical attachment level of 5 mm (CPI ≤ 3 and/or CAL ≤ 1). The independent variables were individual factors (gender, self-declared skin color, schooling, monthly household income, age group, self-rated treatment need, dental pain, dental appointment in the previous 12 months and dental services) and contextual factors (Municipal Human Development Index [MHDI]), Gini coefficient, fluoridated water supply and oral health coverage). Multilevel mixed-effect Poisson regression analyses were performed.The prevalence of functional dentition based on the FDWHO, WDT, FDClass5 and FDClass6 definitions was 77.9%, 72.9%, 42.6% and 40.3%, respectively. Adults with ≥12 years of schooling and monthly household income from US$ 853 to 2557 had higher prevalence rates of FDWHO (PR: 1.41 and 1.10, respectively), WDT (PR: 1.58 and 1.14, respectively), FDClass5 (PR: 2.03 and 1.27, respectively) and FDClass6 (PR: 2.15 and 1.35, respectively). These values in the final models were adjusted for gender, self-declared skin color (FDClass5), age group, self-rated treatment need (FDWHO, FDClass5 and FDClass6), dental appointment in the previous 12 months (FDWHO and WDT), dental services (FDWHO and WDT) and contextual factors. A very high MHDI and presence of fluoridated water supply were associated with higher prevalence rates of the four outcomes.The incorporation of the criteria of new definitions of functional dentition led to a lower prevalence rate among Brazilian adults. Striking individual and contextual inequalities were identified with regard to the four definitions analyzed, which need to be addressed through inter-sector efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2262682586,"Background/Objectives Growing evidence indicates that self-reported height and weight are biased, but little is known about systematic errors in the general adult population in Japan. This study takes advantage of the unique opportunity to examine this issue provided by the 1986 National Nutrition Survey. Subjects/Methods Individual-level data on a nationally representative sample aged 20–89 years from the National Nutrition Survey (November 1986) were merged with Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions (September 1986) data to obtain a dataset containing both self-reported and measured data on height and weight for each person (n = 10,469). Discrepancies between self-reported and measured means of height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were tested across measured BMI categories (<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–27.4, 27.5–29.9, and ≥30.0 kg/m2), age groups (20–44, 45–64, and 65–89 years), and sexes. Reporting bias in mean BMI was decomposed into the contributions of misreporting height and weight. The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported BMI categories were estimated. Results Mean self-reported BMI was substantially underestimated in older women (P<0.001; Cohen’s d, -0.4), and the major contributor to the bias was their over-reported height. Mean self-reported BMI was also considerably underestimated in both men and women who were overweight and obese (P<0.001; Cohen’s d, -1.0 to -0.6), due mainly to their underreported weight. In contrast, mean self-reported BMI was considerably overestimated in underweight men (P<0.001; Cohen’s d, 0.5), due largely to their over-reported weight. The sensitivity of self-reported BMI categories was particularly low for individuals who had a measured BMI of 27.5–29.9 kg/m2 (40.9% for men and 26.8% for women). Conclusions Self-reported anthropometric data were not sufficiently accurate to assert the validity of their use in epidemiological studies on the general adult population in Japan in the late 1980s."
https://openalex.org/W2262578075,"Objective Given the shortage of cost-of-illness studies in dementia outside of the Western population, the current study estimated the annual cost of dementia in Taiwan and assessed whether different categories of care costs vary by severity using multiple disease-severity measures. Methods This study included 231 dementia patient–caregiver dyads in a dementia clinic at a national university hospital in southern Taiwan. Three disease measures including cognitive, functional, and behavioral disturbances were obtained from patients based on medical history. A societal perspective was used to estimate the total costs of dementia according to three cost sub-categories. The association between dementia severity and cost of care was examined through bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results Total costs of care for moderate dementia patient were 1.4 times the costs for mild dementia and doubled from mild to severe dementia among our community-dwelling dementia sample. Multivariate analysis indicated that functional declines had a greater impact on all cost outcomes as compared to behavioral disturbance, which showed no impact on any costs. Informal care costs accounted for the greatest share in total cost of care for both mild (42%) and severe (43%) dementia patients. Conclusions Since the total costs of dementia increased with severity, providing care to delay disease progression, with a focus on maintaining patient physical function, may reduce the overall cost of dementia. The greater contribution of informal care to total costs as opposed to social care also suggests a need for more publicly-funded long-term care services to assist family caregivers of dementia patients in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2272108953,"Flavokawain C (FKC) is a naturally occurring chalcone which can be found in Kava (Piper methysticum Forst) root. The present study evaluated the effect of FKC on the growth of various human cancer cell lines and the underlying associated mechanisms. FKC showed higher cytotoxic activity against HCT 116 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner in comparison to other cell lines (MCF-7, HT-29, A549 and CaSki), with minimal toxicity on normal human colon cells. The apoptosis-inducing capability of FKC on HCT 116 cells was evidenced by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and increased phosphatidylserine externalization. FKC was found to disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the release of Smac/DIABLO, AIF and cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Our results also revealed that FKC induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis via upregulation of the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bak) and death receptors (DR5), while downregulation of the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (XIAP, cIAP-1, c-FlipL, Bcl-xL and survivin), resulting in the activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). FKC was also found to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as suggested by the elevation of GADD153 protein after FKC treatment. After the cells were exposed to FKC (60μM) over 18hrs, there was a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2. The expression of phosphorylated Akt was also reduced. FKC also caused cell cycle arrest in the S phase in HCT 116 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and with accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase. This was accompanied by the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2 and CDK4), consistent with the upregulation of CDK inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27Kip1), and hypophosphorylation of Rb."
https://openalex.org/W2263147110,"One of the puzzling phenomena in philanthropy is that people can show strong compassion for identified individual victims but remain unmoved by catastrophes that affect large numbers of victims. Two prominent findings in research on charitable giving reflect this idiosyncrasy: The (1) identified victim and (2) victim number effects. The first of these suggests that identifying victims increases donations and the second refers to the finding that people’s willingness to donate often decreases as the number of victims increases. While these effects have been documented in the literature, their underlying psychological processes need further study. We propose a model in which identified victim and victim number effects operate through different cognitive and affective mechanisms. In two experiments we present empirical evidence for such a model and show that different affective motivations (donor-focused vs. victim-focused feelings) are related to the cognitive processes of impact judgments and mental imagery. Moreover, we argue that different mediation pathways exist for identifiability and victim number effects."
https://openalex.org/W2285320859,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease with high mortality. Active TGFβ1 is considered central to the pathogenesis of IPF. A major mechanism of TGFβ1 activation in the lung involves the epithelially restricted αvβ6 integrin. Expression of the αvβ6 integrin is dramatically increased in IPF. How αvβ6 integrin expression is regulated in the pulmonary epithelium is unknown. Here we identify a region in the β6 subunit gene (ITGB6) promoter acting to markedly repress basal gene transcription, which responds to both the Ets domain-containing protein Elk1 (Elk1) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Both Elk1 and GR can regulate αvβ6 integrin expression in vitro We demonstrate Elk1 binding to the ITGB6 promoter basally and that manipulation of Elk1 or Elk1 binding alters ITGB6 promoter activity, gene transcription, and αvβ6 integrin expression. Crucially, we find that loss of Elk1 causes enhanced Itgb6 expression and exaggerated lung fibrosis in an in vivo model of fibrosis, whereas the GR agonist dexamethasone inhibits Itgb6 expression. Moreover, Elk1 dysregulation is present in epithelium from patients with IPF. These data reveal a novel role for Elk1 regulating ITGB6 expression and highlight how dysregulation of Elk1 can contribute to human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2265455159,"Bladder cancer represents a significant human tumor burden, accounting for about 7.7% and 2.4% of all cancer cases in males and females, respectively. While men have a higher risk of developing bladder cancer, women tend to present at a later stage of disease and with more aggressive tumors. Previous studies have suggested a promotional role of androgen signaling in enhancing bladder cancer development. To directly assess the role of androgens in bladder tumorigenesis, we have developed a novel transgenic mouse strain, R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+, in which the human AR transgene is conditionally expressed in bladder urothelium. Intriguingly, both male and female R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+ mice display a higher incidence of urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) than the age and sex matched control littermates in response to the carcinogen, N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN). We detect expression of the human AR transgene in CK5-positive and p63-positive basal cells in bladder urothelium. Further analyses of UCC tissues from R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+ mice showed that the majority of tumor cells are of urothelial basal cell origin. Positive immunostaining of transgenic AR protein was observed in the majority of tumor cells of the transgenic mice, providing a link between transgenic AR expression and oncogenic transformation. We observed an increase in Ki67 positive cells within the UCC lesions of transgenic AR mice. Manipulating endogenous androgen levels by castration and androgen supplementation directly affected bladder tumor development in male and female R26hARLoxP/+:Upk3aGCE/+ mice, respectively. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that conditional activation of transgenic AR expression in bladder urothelium enhances carciongen-induced bladder tumor formation in mice. This new AR transgenic mouse line mimics certain features of human bladder cancer and can be used to study bladder tumorigenesis and for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2269784431,"The perception of infant emotions is an integral part of sensitive caregiving within the mother-child relationship, a maternal ability which develops in mothers during their own attachment history. In this study we address the association between maternal attachment representation and brain activity underlying the perception of infant emotions. Event related potentials (ERPs) of 32 primiparous mothers were assessed during a three stimulus oddball task presenting negative, positive and neutral emotion expressions of infants as target, deviant or standard stimuli. Attachment representation was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview during pregnancy. Securely attached mothers recognized emotions of infants more accurately than insecurely attached mothers. ERPs yielded amplified N170 amplitudes for insecure mothers when focusing on negative infant emotions. Secure mothers showed enlarged P3 amplitudes to target emotion expressions of infants compared to insecure mothers, especially within conditions with frequent negative infant emotions. In these conditions, P3 latencies were prolonged in insecure mothers. In summary, maternal attachment representation was found associated with brain activity during the perception of infant emotions. This further clarifies psychological mechanisms contributing to maternal sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2270602584,"Introduction Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool to reduce HIV transmission. The primary objective of this study was to assess awareness of PrEP by individuals living with HIV (HIV+) and acceptance of its use for their HIV negative (HIV-) partners. Methods A cross sectional survey was conducted among individuals living with HIV who received care at an urban HIV clinic between January 2013 and June 2013. The survey examined knowledge, attitudes, and acceptability of PrEP, and perception of transmission risk of HIV. Chi-Square test and Fisher's Exact test were used to compare proportions. Results Among 206 subjects living with HIV, 15.3% (32) had heard of PrEP. Men who have sex with men (MSM) were more likely to be aware of PrEP than all others (p = 0.003). Once educated about PrEP those who believed PrEP would reduce their partner’s risk for HIV were more likely to recommend PrEP to their partner (p<0.001). 92% of all respondents said they would be “extremely likely/likely” to discuss PrEP use with their provider. Of 159 subjects whose main partner was HIV-, MSM (p = 0.007), male participants (p = 0.044), and those who were consistently taking meds (p = 0.049) were more likely to be aware of PrEP. Those who perceived they were at risk of transmitting HIV (p<0.001) and those who were consistently taking meds (0.049) were more likely to agree that PrEP could reduce the risk of HIV to their partners. Conclusion This study illustrates a low awareness of PrEP but once educated the willingness of a cohort of individuals living with HIV to recommend PrEP to their partners. Our findings demonstrate the importance of providers informing their patients living with HIV about PrEP, as these persons are an underutilized link to support the uptake of PrEP by their HIV- partners."
https://openalex.org/W2252294870,"Objectives Choosing the right mentor is crucial for effective mentorship. Yet, many medical students have difficulties finding a suitable mentor. Thus we developed mentoring speed dating (MSD) as a promising matching tool to connect students and faculty mentors successfully. The purpose of this study was to explore mentees’ and mentors’ experience with MSD and investigate the impact of MSD on the perceived mentorship quality and continuance of the mentoring relationship. Methods The authors completed a mixed methods study at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, between June 2011 and March 2014. They conducted four focus groups with mentees and mentors who participated in a mentoring speed dating event and analyzed transcripts using conventional content analysis with inductive categorizing. In addition, three mentoring cohorts (two matched via MSD, one matched via conventional online profiles) were surveyed on mentorship satisfaction and the 1-year continuance of their mentorship was monitored. Fifteen mentees and fifteen mentors participated in the focus groups. The authors identified several themes such as short and long term benefits of MSD and fulfillment of expectations. Benefits included finding out about the personal connection, matching expectations, providing an efficient overview of candidates. The survey was completed by 93 students (n = 29 without MSD; n = 64 with MSD). Independent t-tests and multivariate analysis of variance were used to analyze the impact of MSD on student’s mentorship satisfaction. Results There were significant differences in responses to the items “Commitment of mentor” (p = .019) and “Constructive feedback” (p = .038) among the students who attended MSD and the students without MSD. After one year far more mentoring relationships existed among those mentees who participated in MSD in comparison to the “no MSD group”. Conclusion MSD is a valuable matching tool with beneficial effects on the mentorship quality. It enhances essential factors in the mentoring relationship such as commitment and satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2298414589,"Abstract Cofactor F420 is an electron carrier with a major role in the oxidoreductive reactions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. A γ-glutamyl ligase catalyzes the final steps of the F420 biosynthesis pathway by successive additions of l-glutamate residues to F420-0, producing a poly-γ-glutamate tail. The enzyme responsible for this reaction in archaea (CofE) comprises a single domain and produces F420-2 as the major species. The homologous M. tuberculosis enzyme, FbiB, is a two-domain protein and produces F420 with predominantly 5–7 l-glutamate residues in the poly-γ-glutamate tail. The N-terminal domain of FbiB is homologous to CofE with an annotated γ-glutamyl ligase activity, whereas the C-terminal domain has sequence similarity to an FMN-dependent family of nitroreductase enzymes. Here we demonstrate that full-length FbiB adds multiple l-glutamate residues to F420-0 in vitro to produce F420-5 after 24 h; communication between the two domains is critical for full γ-glutamyl ligase activity. We also present crystal structures of the C-terminal domain of FbiB in apo-, F420-0-, and FMN-bound states, displaying distinct sites for F420-0 and FMN ligands that partially overlap. Finally, we discuss the features of a full-length structural model produced by small angle x-ray scattering and its implications for the role of N- and C-terminal domains in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2258354873,"Whole rye (WR) consumption seems to be associated with beneficial health effects. Although rye fiber and polyphenols are thought to be bioactive, the mechanisms behind the health effects of WR have yet to be fully identified. This study in rats was designed to investigate whether WR can influence the metabolism of n-3 and n-6 long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and gut microbiota composition.For 12 weeks, rats were fed a diet containing either 50% WR or 50% refined rye (RR). The WR diet provided more fiber (+21%) and polyphenols (+29%) than the RR diet. Fat intake was the same in both diets and particularly involved similar amounts of essential (18-carbon) n-3 and n-6 LCFAs.The WR diet significantly increased the 24-hour urinary excretion of polyphenol metabolites-including enterolactone-compared with the RR diet. The WR rats had significantly more n-3 LCFA-in particular, eicosapentanoic (EPA) and docosahexanoic (DHA) acids-in their plasma and liver. Compared with the RR diet, the WR diet brought significant changes in gut microbiota composition, with increased diversity in the feces (Shannon and Simpson indices), decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and decreased proportions of uncultured Clostridiales cluster IA and Clostridium cluster IV in the feces. In contrast, no difference was found between groups with regards to cecum microbiota. The WR rats had lower concentrations of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in cecum and feces (p<0.05). Finally, acetate was lower (p<0.001) in the cecum of WR rats while butyrate was lower (p<0.05) in the feces of WR rats.This study shows for the first time that WR consumption results in major biological modifications-increased plasma and liver n-3 EPA and DHA levels and improved gut microbiota profile, notably with increased diversity-known to provide health benefits. Unexpectedly, WR decreased SCFA levels in both cecum and feces. More studies are needed to understand the interactions between whole rye (fiber and polyphenols) and gut microbiota and also the mechanisms of action responsible for stimulating n-3 fatty acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2269178061,"This study aimed to analyze changes in saliva composition and salivary secretion process of rats with chronic kidney disease induced by 5/6 nephrectomy to set the foundation for salivary studies related to CKD.CKD was induced in Wistar rats via 5/6 nephrectomy. Blood and saliva samples were collected from Control, Sham and CKD groups at 8 and 12 weeks after the surgery. Salivation was stimulated via intraperitoneal injections of pilocarpine (1.0 mg/Kg body weight) or isoproterenol (5.0 mg/Kg body weight). Saliva was collected and immediately stored at -80°C until analysis. The salivary flow rate, total protein, amylase and peroxidase activities, and urea concentrations were measured. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine concentrations were also evaluated.Increases in BUN and serum creatinine concentrations were observed in the CKD groups. Amylase activity was significantly reduced in response to both stimuli in the CKD groups at 8 weeks and increased in the CKD groups at 12 weeks in response to isoproterenol stimulus. The peroxidase activities of the CKD groups were significantly reduced in response to isoproterenol stimulation and were increased at 12 weeks in response to pilocarpine stimulation. Salivary urea was significantly increased in the CKD groups at 8 weeks in response to the isoproterenol stimuli and at 12 weeks in response to both salivary agonists.The pattern of alterations observed in this experimental model is similar to those observed in patients and clearly demonstrates the viability of 5/6 nephrectomy as an experimental model in future studies to understand the alterations in salivary compositions and in salivary glands that are elicited by CKD."

Methods RGD peptides were conjugated to the surfaces of microbubbles via biotin-avidin linkage. Microbubbles bearing RADfK peptides were prepared as controls. The RGD-MBs were characterized using an Accusizer 780 and optical microscopy. The binding specificity of the RGD-MBs for ανβ3-expressing endothelial cells (bEnd.3) was demonstrated in vitro by a competitive inhibition experiment. In an in vivo study, mice bearing tumors of three different stages were intravenously injected with RGD-MBs and subjected to targeted, contrast-enhanced, high-frequency ultrasound. Subsequently, tumors were harvested and sectioned for immunofluorescence analysis of ανβ3 expression. Results The mean size of the RGD-MBs was 2.36 ± 1.7 μm. The RGD-MBs showed significantly higher adhesion levels to bEnd.3 cells compared to control MBs (P < 0.01). There was rarely binding of RGD-MBs to αvβ3-negative MCF-7 cells. Adhesion of the RGD-MBs to the bEnd.3 cells was significantly inhibited following treatment with anti-alpha(v) antibodies. The quantitative acoustic video intensity for high-frequency, contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging of subcutaneous human laryngeal carcinoma (Hep-2) tumor xenografts was significantly higher in small tumors (19.89 ± 2.49) than in medium tumors (11.25 ± 2.23) and large tumors (3.38 ± 0.67) (P < 0.01). Conclusions RGD-MBs enable noninvasive in vivo visualization of changes in tumor angiogenesis during tumor growth in subcutaneous cancer xenografts."

https://openalex.org/W2312693163,"Srs2 plays many roles in DNA repair, the proper regulation and coordination of which is essential. Post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is one such possible mechanism. Here, we investigate the role of SUMO in Srs2 regulation and show that the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of Srs2 is important for the interaction with several recombination factors. Lack of SIM, but not proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-interacting motif (PIM), leads to increased cell death under circumstances requiring homologous recombination for DNA repair. Simultaneous mutation of SIM in a srs2ΔPIM strain leads to a decrease in recombination, indicating a pro-recombination role of SUMO. Thus SIM has an ambivalent function in Srs2 regulation; it not only mediates interaction with SUMO-PCNA to promote the anti-recombination function but it also plays a PCNA-independent pro-recombination role, probably by stimulating the formation of recombination complexes. The fact that deletion of PIM suppresses the phenotypes of Srs2 lacking SIM suggests that proper balance between the anti-recombination PCNA-bound and pro-recombination pools of Srs2 is crucial.

https://openalex.org/W2260311182,"Phase changes in Bacteroides fragilis, a member of the human colonic microbiota, mediate variations in a vast array of cell surface molecules, such as capsular polysaccharides and outer membrane proteins through DNA inversion. The results of the present study show that outer membrane vesicle (OMV) formation in this anaerobe is also controlled by DNA inversions at two distantly localized promoters, IVp-I and IVp-II that are associated with extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis and the expression of outer membrane proteins. These promoter inversions are mediated by a single tyrosine recombinase encoded by BF2766 (orthologous to tsr19 in strain NCTC9343) in B. fragilis YCH46, which is located near IVp-I. A series of BF2766 mutants were constructed in which the two promoters were locked in different configurations (IVp-I/IVp-II = ON/ON, OFF/OFF, ON/OFF or OFF/ON). ON/ON B. fragilis mutants exhibited hypervesiculating, whereas the other mutants formed only a trace amount of OMVs. The hypervesiculating ON/ON mutants showed higher resistance to treatment with bile, LL-37, and human β-defensin 2. Incubation of wild-type cells with 5% bile increased the population of cells with the ON/ON genotype. These results indicate that B. fragilis regulates the formation of OMVs through DNA inversions at two distantly related promoter regions in response to membrane stress, although the mechanism underlying the interplay between the two regions controlled by the invertible promoters remains unknown."

There are several structures available for the ligand-bound sugar SBPs, but very few unliganded structures are reported. No structural data are available for sugar SBPs from Pseudomonas sp. to date. This study reports the first high resolution crystal structures of periplasmic glucose-binding protein from Pseudomonas putida CSV86 (ppGBP) in unliganded form (2.5 Å) and complexed with glucose (1.25 Å) and galactose (1.8 Å). Asymmetric domain closure of ppGBP was observed upon substrate binding. The ppGBP was found to have an affinity of ∼ 0.3 μm for glucose. The structural analysis showed that the sugars are bound to the protein mainly by hydrogen bonds, and the loss of two strong hydrogen bonds between ppGBP and galactose compared with glucose may be responsible for lowering its affinity toward galactose. The higher stability of ppGBP-glucose complex was also indicated by an 8 °C increase in the melting temperature compared with unliganded form and ppGBP-galactose complex. ppGBP binds to monosaccharide, but the structural features revealed it to have an oligosaccharide-binding protein fold, indicating that during evolution the sugar binding pocket may have undergone structural modulation to accommodate monosaccharide only.

https://openalex.org/W2270628532,"After the 1998 mandatory folic acid fortification of enriched cereal-grain products in the U.S., safety concerns were raised that excess consumption of folic acid and high blood folate biomarkers detected in adults may increase the risk of certain types of cancer.Baseline data from about 1400 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, aged ≥ 57 years were linked to Medicare and mortality files through December 31, 2007. Using cox proportional hazards regression models, we assessed associations between dietary folate equivalents, folate biomarkers, the presence of unmetabolized folic acid and, overall cancer incidence.With 8,114 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up, 6.3 years), about 125 cancer cases were identified. After adjusting for confounders, the hazard ratios of the highest quartile versus the second quartile of RBC folate and dietary folate equivalents were 0.54 (95% CI: 0.31-0.93) and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.30-0.95), respectively. Additionally, serum and RBC folate as continuous variables were inversely and significantly associated with cancer incidence (p<0.01). No significant associations were observed between the presence of unmetabolized folic acid, intake of naturally-occurring food folate or folic acid separately, and cancer incidence.High total folate intake and biomarkers in older adults appear to be protective against cancer in post-folic acid fortification years. This study does not show a negative impact of current level of folic acid fortification on cancer risk. As this is one of the few studies to examine the association between unmetabolized folic acid and cancer outcome, a study including a larger nationwide representative sample of the U.S. population is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2256782573,"Bone remodelling models are widely used in a phenomenological manner to estimate numerically the distribution of apparent density in bones from the loads they are daily subjected to. These simulations start from an arbitrary initial distribution, usually homogeneous, and the density changes locally until a bone remodelling equilibrium is achieved. The bone response to mechanical stimulus is traditionally formulated with a mathematical relation that considers the existence of a range of stimulus, called dead or lazy zone, for which no net bone mass change occurs. Implementing a relation like that leads to different solutions depending on the starting density. The non-uniqueness of the solution has been shown in this paper using two different bone remodelling models: one isotropic and another anisotropic. It has also been shown that the problem of non-uniqueness is only mitigated by removing the dead zone, but it is not completely solved unless the bone formation and bone resorption rates are limited to certain maximum values."
https://openalex.org/W2258223485,"Hypoxia-based cell culture experiments are routine and essential components of in vitro cancer research. Most laboratories use low-cost portable modular chambers to achieve hypoxic conditions for cell cultures, where the sealed chambers are purged with a gas mixture of preset O2 concentration. Studies are conducted under the assumption that hypoxia remains unaltered throughout the 48 to 72 hour duration of such experiments. Since these chambers lack any sensor or detection system to monitor gas-phase O2, the cell-based data tend to be non-uniform due to the ad hoc nature of the experimental setup.With the availability of low-cost open-source microcontroller-based electronic project kits, it is now possible for researchers to program these with easy-to-use software, link them to sensors, and place them in basic scientific apparatus to monitor and record experimental parameters. We report here the design and construction of a small-footprint kit for continuous measurement and recording of O2 concentration in modular hypoxia chambers. The low-cost assembly (US$135) consists of an Arduino-based microcontroller, data-logging freeware, and a factory pre-calibrated miniature O2 sensor. A small, intuitive software program was written by the authors to control the data input and output. The basic nature of the kit will enable any student in biology with minimal experience in hobby-electronics to assemble the system and edit the program parameters to suit individual experimental conditions.We show the kit's utility and stability of data output via a series of hypoxia experiments. The studies also demonstrated the critical need to monitor and adjust gas-phase O2 concentration during hypoxia-based experiments to prevent experimental errors or failure due to partial loss of hypoxia. Thus, incorporating the sensor-microcontroller module to a portable hypoxia chamber provides a researcher a capability that was previously available only to labs with access to sophisticated (and expensive) cell culture incubators."

Given its’ reported significance in biofilm formation and the superior performance of S. aureus biofilm versus planktonic vaccine in the mouse mastitis model, it was of interest to determine the immunogenicity and protective potential of Protein A as a potential vaccine candidate against bovine mastitis using the mouse mastitis model. Pregnant Balb/c mice were immunised with Protein A emulsified in an alum-based adjuvant by subcutaneous (s/c) or intramammary (i/mam) routes. While humoral immune response of mice post-immunization were determined using indirect ELISA, cell-mediated immune response was assessed by estimation of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) produced by protein A-stimulated splenocyte supernatants. Protective potential of Protein A against experimental mastitis was determined by challenge of immunized versus sham-vaccinated mice by i/mam route, based upon manifestation of clinical symptoms, total bacterial load and histopathological damage to mammary glands. Significantly (p<0.05) higher levels of IgG1 isotype were produced in mice immunized by the s/c route. In contrast, significantly higher levels of the antibody isotype IgG2a were produced in mice immunized by the i/mam route (p<0.05). There was significant reduction (p<0.05) in bacterial loads of the mammary glands of mice immunized by Protein A regardless of the route of immunization, with medium level of clinical symptoms observed up to day 3 post-challenge. However, Protein A vaccine failed to protect immunized mice post-challenge with biofilm producing encapsulated S. aureus via i/mam route, regardless of the route of immunization, as measured by the level of mammary tissue damage. It was concluded that, Protein A in its’ native state was apparently not a suitable candidate for inclusion in a cell-free vaccine formulation against mastitis."

Analysis of purified OPH revealed that it was modified with the fatty acids palmitate and stearate. Membrane-bound OPH was shown to interact with the outer membrane efflux protein TolC and with PstS, the periplasmic component of the ABC transporter complex (PstSACB) involved in phosphate transport. Interaction of OPH with PstS appears to facilitate transport of Pigenerated from organophosphates due to the combined action of OPH and periplasmically located phosphatases. Consistent with this model,opdnull mutants ofB. diminutafailed to grow using the organophosphate insecticide methyl parathion as sole source of phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2263210438,"Phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) is activated by G protein subunits in response to environmental stimuli to increase intracellular calcium. In cells, a significant portion of PLCβ is cytosolic, where it binds a protein complex required for efficient RNA-induced silencing called C3PO (component 3 promoter of RISC). Binding between C3PO and PLCβ raises the possibility that RNA silencing activity can affect the ability of PLCβ to mediate calcium signals. By use of human and rat neuronal cell lines (SK-N-SH and PC12), we show that overexpression of one of the main components of C3PO diminishes Ca2+ release in response to Gαq/PLCβ stimulation by 30 to 40%. In untransfected SK-N-SH or PC12 cells, the introduction of siRNA(GAPDH) [small interfering RNA(glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase)] reduces PLCβ-mediated calcium signals by ~30%, but addition of siRNA(Hsp90) (heat shock protein 90) had little effect. Fluorescence imaging studies suggest an increase in PLCβ-C3PO association in cells treated with siRNA(GAPDH) but not siRNA(Hsp90). Taken together, our studies raise the possibility that Ca2+ responses to extracellular stimuli can be modulated by components of the RNA silencing machinery.—Philip, F., Sahu, S., Golebiewska, U., Scarlata, S.

https://openalex.org/W2255742337,"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Elevated free fatty acids (FFAs) may impair beta cell function and mass (lipotoxicity). Altered calcium homeostasis may be involved in defective insulin release. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major intracellular calcium store. Lipotoxicity induces ER stress and in parallel an ER calcium depletion through unknown ER calcium leak channels. The main purposes of this study is first to identify one of these channels and secondly, to check the opportunity to restore beta cells function (i.e., insulin secretion) after pharmacological inhibition of ER calcium store depletion. We investigated the functionality of translocon, an ER calcium leak channel and its involvement on FFAs-induced alterations in MIN6B1 cells and in human pancreatic islets. We evidenced that translocon acts as a functional ER calcium leak channel in human beta cells using anisomycin and puromycin (antibiotics), respectively blocker and opener of this channel. Puromycin induced a significant ER calcium release, inhibited by anisomycin pretreatment. Palmitate treatment was used as FFA model to induce a mild lipotoxic effect: ER calcium content was reduced, ER stress but not apoptosis were induced and glucose induced insulin secretion was decreased in our beta cells. Interestingly, translocon inhibition by chronic anisomycin treatment prevented dysfunctions induced by palmitate, avoiding reticular calcium depletion, ER stress and restoring insulin secretion. Our results provide for the first time compelling evidence that translocon actively participates to the palmitate-induced ER calcium leak and insulin secretion decrease in beta cells. Its inhibition reduces these lipotoxic effects. Taken together, our data indicate that TLC may be a new potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."

Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of PPAR-δ-agonist treatment on cardiac healing in post-myocardial infarction (MI) rats. Animals were assigned to the following groups: sham-operated control group, left anterior descending coronary artery ligation (MI) group, or MI with administration of the PPAR-δ agonist GW610742 group. GW610742 (1 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally after the operation and repeated every 3 days. Echocardiographic data showed no differences between the two groups in terms of cardiac function and remodeling until 4 weeks. However, the degrees of angiogenesis and fibrosis after MI were significantly higher in the GW610742-treated rats than in the untreated MI rats at 1 week following MI, which changes were not different at 2 weeks after MI. Naturally, PPAR-δ expression in infarcted myocardium was highest increased in 3 day after MI and then disappeared in 14 day after MI. GW610742 increased myofibroblast differentiation and transforming growth factor-beta 2 expression in the infarct zone at 7 days after MI. GW610742 also increased bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) recruitment in whole myocardium, and increased serum platelet-derived growth factor B, stromal-derived factor-1 alpha, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 levels at day 3 after MI. PPAR-δ agonists treatment have the temporal effect on early fibrosis of infarcted myocardium, which might not sustain the functional and structural beneficial effect."
https://openalex.org/W2268699309,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses in the hippocampus is thought to play a key role in episodic memory formation. Because the hippocampus is a shorter-term, limited capacity storage system, repeated bouts of learning and synaptic plasticity require that SC synapses reset to baseline at some point following LTP. We previously showed that repeated low frequency activation of temperoammonic (TA) inputs to the CA1 region depotentiates SC LTP without persistently altering basal transmission. This heterosynaptic depotentiation involves adenosine A1 receptors but not N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors or L-type calcium channels. In the present study, we used rat hippocampal slices to explore other messengers contributing to TA-induced SC depotentiation, and provide evidence for the involvement of cannabinoid-1 and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors as more proximal signaling events leading to synaptic resetting, with A1 receptor activation serving as a downstream event. Surprisingly, we found that TA-induced SC depotentiation is independent of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptors. We also examined the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and found a role for extracellular-signal related kinase 1/2 and p38 MAPK, but not c-Jun-N-terminal kinase. These results indicate that low frequency stimulation of TA inputs to CA1 activates a complex signaling network that instructs SC synaptic resetting. The involvement of GABA and endocannabinoids suggest mechanisms that could contribute to cognitive dysfunction associated with substance abuse and neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2253768935,"Transferring Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to water is known to extend their lifespan. However, it is unclear whether this lifespan extension is due to slowing the aging process or merely keeping old yeast alive. Here we show that in water-transferred yeast, the toxicity of polyQ proteins is decreased and the aging biomarker 47Q aggregates at a reduced rate and to a lesser extent. These beneficial effects of water-transfer could not be reproduced by diluting the growth medium and depended on de novo protein synthesis and proteasomes levels. Interestingly, we found that upon water-transfer 27 proteins are downregulated, 4 proteins are upregulated and 81 proteins change their intracellular localization, hinting at an active genetic program enabling the lifespan extension. Furthermore, the aging-related deterioration of the heat shock response (HSR), the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), was largely prevented in water-transferred yeast, as the activities of these proteostatic network pathways remained nearly as robust as in young yeast. The characteristics of young yeast that are actively maintained upon water-transfer indicate that the extended lifespan is the outcome of slowing the rate of the aging process."
https://openalex.org/W2259516187,"Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and Nrf2 is the transcriptional factor central in cellular antioxidant responses. In the present study, we investigate the effect of a dihydrolipoic acid derivative lipoicmethylenedioxyphenol (LMDP) on the progression of atherosclerosis and test whether its effect on atherosclerosis is mediated by Nrf2.Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning and en face analysis reveal that 14 weeks of treatment with LMDP markedly reduced atherosclerotic burden in a rabbit balloon vascular injury model. Myograph analyses show decreased aortic contractile response to phenylephrine and increased aortic response to acetylcholine and insulin in LMDP-treated animals, suggesting that LMDP inhibits atherosclerosis through improving vascular function. A role of Nrf2 signaling in mediating the amelioration of vascular function by LMDP was supported by increased Nrf2 translocation into nuclear and increased expression of Nrf2 target genes. Furthermore, chemotaxis analysis with Boydem chamber shows that leukocytes isolated from LMDP-treated rabbits had reduced chemotaxis, and knock-down of Nrf2 significantly reduced the effect of LMDP on the chemotaxis of mouse macrophages.Our results support that LMDP has an anti-atherosclerotic effect likely through activation of Nrf2 signaling and subsequent inhibition of macrophage chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2263593807,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury is a dynamic process consisting of two stages: ischemia and reperfusion, and triggers a cascade of physiological and biochemical events. Given the important role of microRNAs in regulating gene expression, we analyzed gene expression changes in mouse livers at sham control, ischemia stage, and reperfusion stage. We generated global expression profiles of microRNA and mRNA genes in mouse livers subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury at the three stages, respectively. Comparison analysis showed that reperfusion injury had a distinct expression profile whereas the ischemia sample and the sham control were clustered together. Consistently, there are 69 differentially expressed microRNAs between the reperfusion sample and the sham control whereas 28 differentially expressed microRNAs between the ischemia sample and the sham control. We further identified two modes of microRNA expression changes in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Functional analysis of both the differentially expressed microRNAs in the two modes and their target mRNAs revealed that ischemia injury impaired mitochondrial function, nutrient consumption, and metabolism process. In contrast, reperfusion injury led to severe tissue inflammation that is predominantly an innate-immune response in the ischemia-reperfusion process. Our staged analysis of gene expression profiles provides new insights into regulatory mechanisms of microRNAs in mouse hepatic IR injury."

We defined the current admissions, transfers and costs in relation to disease severity of GBS.Dutch neurologists were requested to report patients diagnosed with GBS between November 2009 and November 2010. Information regarding clinical course and transfers was obtained via neurologists and general practitioners.87 GBS patients were included with maximal GBS disability score of 1 or 2 (28%), 3 or 4 (53%), 5 (18%) and 6 (1%). Four mildly affected GBS patients were not hospital admitted. Of the 83 hospitalized patients 68 (82%) were initially admitted at a neurology department, 4 (5%) at an ICU, 4 (5%) at pediatrics, 4 (5%) at pediatrics neurology and 3 (4%) at internal medicine. Median hospital stay was 17 days (IQR 11-26 days, absolute range 1-133 days). Transfers between departments or hospitals occurred in 33 (40%) patients and 25 (30%) were transferred 2 times or more. From a cost-effectiveness perspective 21 (25%) of the admissions was suboptimal. Median costs for hospital admission of GBS patients were 15,060 Euro (IQR 11,226-23,683). Maximal GBS disability score was significantly correlated with total length of stay, number of transfers, ICU admission and costs.Hospital admissions for GBS patients are highly heterogeneous, with frequent transfers and higher costs for those with more severe disease. Future research should aim to develop prediction models to early identify the most cost-effective allocation in individual patients."
https://openalex.org/W2254247419,"Purpose We assessed the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy (AAT) on radiation therapy (RT), evaluating the tumor growth and perfusion patterns on dynamic contrast enhanced MR (DCE-MR) images. Methods Thirteen nude mice with heterotopic xenograft cancer of human lung cancer cell line were used. To observe the interval change of the tumor size and demonstrate the time-signal intensity enhancement curve of the tumor, the mice were subdivided into four groups: control (n = 2), AAT (n = 2), RT (n = 5), and combined therapy (AART, n = 4). DCE-MR images were taken four weeks after treatment. Perfusion parameters were obtained based on the Brix model. To compare the interval size changes in the RT group with those in the AART group, repeated measures ANOVA was used. Perfusion parameters in both the RT and AART groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results Tumor growth was more suppressed in AART group than in the other groups. Control group showed the rapid wash-in and wash-out pattern on DCE-MR images. In contrast to RT group with delayed and prolonged enhancement, both AAT and AART groups showed the rapid wash-in and plateau pattern. The signal intensity in the plateau/time to peak enhancement (P<0.016) and the maximum enhancement ratio (P<0.016) of AART group were higher than those of RT group. Conclusions AART showed synergistic effects in anticancer treatment. The pattern of the time-intensity curve on the DCE-MR images in each group implies that AAT might help maintain the perfusion in the cancer of AART group."
https://openalex.org/W2265882845,"The heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gsα couples receptors to activate adenylyl cyclase and is required for the intracellular cAMP response and protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Gsα is ubiquitously expressed in many cell types; however, the role of Gsα in neural crest cells (NCCs) remains unclear. Here we report that NCCs-specific Gsα knockout mice die within hours after birth and exhibit dramatic craniofacial malformations, including hypoplastic maxilla and mandible, cleft palate and craniofacial skeleton defects. Histological and anatomical analysis reveal that the cleft palate in Gsα knockout mice is a secondary defect resulting from craniofacial skeleton deficiencies. In Gsα knockout mice, the morphologies of NCCs-derived cranial nerves are normal, but the development of dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia are impaired. Furthermore, loss of Gsα in NCCs does not affect cranial NCCs migration or cell proliferation, but significantly accelerate osteochondrogenic differentiation. Taken together, our study suggests that Gsα is required for neural crest cells-derived craniofacial development."
https://openalex.org/W2268605740,"It is well known that natriuretic peptides (NPs) are involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are the pacemaker cells of gastrointestinal motility and gastrointestinal dyskinesia is one of the important digestive tract symptoms of depression. However, it is unclear whether they are involved in depression-induced loss of ICC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the natriuretic peptide signaling pathway and depression-induced loss of gastric ICC in depressed rats. These results showed that the expression of c-kit and stem cell factor (SCF) in smooth muscle layers of stomach were down-regulated in depressed rats at the mRNA and protein levels. The expression of natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A, B and C were up-regulated in the stomach of depressed rats at the mRNA and protein levels. NPR-A, B and C can significantly decrease the expression of SCF to treat cultured gastric smooth muscle cells (GSMCs) obtained from normal rats with different concentrations of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). Pretreatment of cultured GSMCs with 8-Brom-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP, a membrane permeable cGMP analog), cANF (a specific NPR-C agonist) and CNP (10-6 mol/L) demonstrated that 8-Br-cGMP had a similar effect as CNP, but treatment with cANF did not. The results of the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that high concentrations of cANF (10-6 mol/L) restrained the proliferation of cultured GSMCs. Taken together, these results indicate that the up-regulation of the NPs/NPR-C and NPs/NPR-A, B/cGMP signaling pathways may be involved in depression-induced loss of gastric ICC."
https://openalex.org/W2269951364,"In recent years, real-time face recognition has been a major topic of interest in developing intelligent human-machine interaction systems. Over the past several decades, researchers have proposed different algorithms for facial expression recognition, but there has been little focus on detection in real-time scenarios. The present work proposes a new algorithmic method of automated marker placement used to classify six facial expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. Emotional facial expressions were captured using a webcam, while the proposed algorithm placed a set of eight virtual markers on each subject’s face. Facial feature extraction methods, including marker distance (distance between each marker to the center of the face) and change in marker distance (change in distance between the original and new marker positions), were used to extract three statistical features (mean, variance, and root mean square) from the real-time video sequence. The initial position of each marker was subjected to the optical flow algorithm for marker tracking with each emotional facial expression. Finally, the extracted statistical features were mapped into corresponding emotional facial expressions using two simple non-linear classifiers, K-nearest neighbor and probabilistic neural network. The results indicate that the proposed automated marker placement algorithm effectively placed eight virtual markers on each subject’s face and gave a maximum mean emotion classification rate of 96.94% using the probabilistic neural network."
https://openalex.org/W2264488816,"The late-gestation fetal sheep responds to hypoxia with physiological, neuroendocrine, and cellular responses that aid in fetal survival. The response of the fetus to hypoxia represents a coordinated effort to maximize oxygen transfer from the mother and minimize wasteful oxygen consumption by the fetus. While there have been many studies aimed at investigating the coordinated physiological and endocrine responses to hypoxia, and while immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization studies have revealed pathways supporting the endocrine function of the pituitary, there is little known about the coordinated cellular response of the pituitary to the hypoxia.Thirty min hypoxia (from 17.0±1.7 to 8.0±0.8 mm Hg, followed by 30 min normoxia) upregulated 595 and downregulated 790 genes in fetal pituitary (123-132 days' gestation; term = 147 days). Network inference of up- and down- regulated genes revealed a high degree of functional relatedness amongst the gene sets. Gene ontology analysis revealed upregulation of cellular metabolic processes (e.g., RNA synthesis, response to estrogens) and downregulation of protein phosphorylation, protein metabolism, and mitosis. Genes found to be at the center of the network of upregulated genes included genes important for purine binding and signaling. At the center of the downregulated network were genes involved in mRNA processing, DNA repair, sumoylation, and vesicular trafficking. Transcription factor analysis revealed that both up- and down-regulated gene sets are enriched for control by several transcription factors (e.g., SP1, MAZ, LEF1, NRF1, ELK1, NFAT, E12, PAX4) but not for HIF-1, which is known to be an important controller of genomic responses to hypoxia.The multiple analytical approaches used in this study suggests that the acute response to 30 min of transient hypoxia in the late-gestation fetus results in reduced cellular metabolism and a pattern of gene expression that is consistent with cellular oxygen and ATP starvation. In this early time point, we see a vigorous gene response. But, like the hypothalamus, the transcriptomic response is not consistent with mediation by HIF-1. If HIF-1 is a significant controller of gene expression in the fetal pituitary after hypoxia, it must be at a later time."

Imaging the serotonergic system could improve diagnosis and therapy of multiple canine behavioural disorders. Furthermore, as many similarities are reported between several human neuropsychiatric conditions and naturally occurring canine behavioural disorders, making this tracer available for use in dogs also provide researchers an interesting non-primate animal model to investigate human disorders. Five adult beagles underwent a 90 minutes dynamic PET scan and arterial whole blood was sampled throughout the scan. For each ROI, the distribution volume (VT), obtained via the one- and two- tissue compartment model (1-TC, 2-TC) and the Logan Plot, was calculated and the goodness-of-fit was evaluated by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For the preferred compartmental model BPND values were estimated and compared with those derived by four reference tissue models: 4-parameter RTM, SRTM2, MRTM2 and the Logan reference tissue model. The 2-TC model indicated in 61% of the ROIs a better fit compared to the 1-TC model. The Logan plot produced almost identical VT values and can be used as an alternative. Compared with the 2-TC model, all investigated reference tissue models showed high correlations but small underestimations of the BPND-parameter. The highest correlation was achieved with the Logan reference tissue model (Y = 0.9266 x + 0.0257; R2 = 0.9722). Therefore, this model can be put forward as a non-invasive standard model for future PET-experiments with [11C]DASB in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2273333327,"Sumoylation is a multistep, multienzymatic post-translational modification in which a small ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SUMO) is attached to the target. We present the first mathematical model for sumoylation including enzyme mechanism details such as autosumoylation of E2 and multifunctional nature of SENP. Simulations and analysis reveal three nonobvious properties for the long term response, modeled as an open system: (i) the steady state sumoylation level is robust to variation in several enzyme properties; (ii) even when autosumoylation of E2 results in equal or higher activity, the target sumoylation levels are lower; and (iii) there is an optimal SENP concentration at which steady state target sumoylation level is maximum. These results are qualitatively different for a short term response modeled as a closed system, where e.g. sumoylation always decreases with increasing SENP levels. Simulations with multiple targets suggest that the available SUMO is limiting, indicating a possible explanation for the experimentally observed low fractional sumoylation. We predict qualitative differences in system responses at short post-translational and longer transcriptional time scales. We thus use this mechanism-based model to explain system properties and generate testable hypotheses for existence and mechanism of unexpected responses."
https://openalex.org/W2326636105,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are projection neurons in the neural retina that relay visual information from the environment to the central nervous system.

To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying RGC generation in the mouse retina, we analyzed the expression and function of Fez family zinc finger 2 (FEZF2), a transcription factor critical for the development of projection neurons in the cerebral cortex. Fezf2 mRNA and protein were transiently expressed at embryonic day 16.5 in the inner neuroblast layer and the prospective ganglion cell layer of the retina, respectively. Knockout of Fezf2 in the developing retina reduced BRN3B+ cells and increased apoptotic cell markers. Fezf2 knockdown by retinal in utero electroporation diminished BRN3B but not the coexpressed ISLET1 and BRN3A, indicating that the BRN3B decrease was the cause, not the result, of the overall reduction of BRN3B+ RGCs in the Fezf2 knockout retina. Moreover, the mRNA and promoter activity of Brn3b were increased in vitro by FEZF2, which bound to a 5′ regulatory fragment in the Brn3b genomic locus.

In all vertebrates examined, RGCs are the first born neurons in the retina. In mice, multipotent retinal progenitor cells begin to exit mitosis and differentiate into RGC-competent precursors around embryonic day 11 (E11). RGC competence is fundamentally a cell-intrinsic process that is activated by the early expression of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MATH5, targeted deletion of which blocks the formation of most RGCs (1.Yang Z. Ding K. Pan L. Deng M. Gan L. Math5 determines the competence state of retinal ganglion cell progenitors.Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

A recent lineage tracing study of Math5-expressing cells in the retina also argues that not all RGCs descend from MATH5+ progenitors (14.Brzezinski 4th, J.A. Prasov L. Glaser T. Math5 defines the ganglion cell competence state in a subpopulation of retinal progenitor cells exiting the cell cycle.Dev. Biol. 2012; 365: 395-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise transcriptional cascade leading to the generation of RGCs remains to be explored. RGCs transmit visual information from the environment to the central nervous system and are the sole projection neurons in the retina. The projection neurons in the cerebral cortex have been extensively studied by in vivo genetic manipulations. It was found that transcription factor FEZF2 (also known as FEZL and ZFP312) was expressed by early neural progenitors in the ventricular zone of the dorsal telencephalon. Zinc finger protein FEZF2 represses the expression of Hes5 in proliferating neural stem cells (15.Shimizu T. Nakazawa M. Kani S. Bae Y.K. Shimizu T. Kageyama R. Hibi M.

Fezf2 is required for the proper specification and differentiation of subcerebral projection neurons in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex (18.Chen J.G. Rasin M.R. Kwan K.Y. Sestan N.

Overall, these observations led us to hypothesize that Fezf2 may regulate the specification of retinal projection neuron RGCs. In this study, we examined the expression and function of Fezf2 in developing retinas. We found that Fezf2 was transiently expressed in retinas during the generation of RGCs. To investigate the role of Fezf2, we inhibited its expression by RNA interference and deleted the gene by conditional Fezf2 knockout in the retina. Our results showed that knockdown and knockout of Fezf2 led to BRN3B inhibition and impaired the formation of RGCs. Moreover, FEZF2 regulated the transcription of Brn3b by binding to a 5′ regulatory sequence of the Brn3b locus. Animal procedures were performed according to the protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee of Wenzhou Medical University. Tg (Fezf2-EGFP) mice were created by the GENSAT project and obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center. Fezf2flox/flox mice were provided by Nenad Sestan (Yale University). Exon 2, which encodes amino acids 1–279 of 455 in FEZF2, was targeted for removal (21.Han W. Kwan K.Y. Shim S. Lam M.M. Shin Y. Xu X. Zhu Y. Li M. Sestan N. TBR1 directly represses Fezf2 to control the laminar origin and development of the corticospinal tract.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3041-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The Tg(Six3-cre)69Frty mouse was created by Yasuhide Furuta (RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology) (22.Furuta Y. Lagutin O. Hogan B.L. Oliver G.C. Retina- and ventral forebrain-specific Cre recombinase activity in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2000; 26: 130-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and was initially obtained from Lin Gan (University of Rochester Medical Center). Dr. Furuta granted permission for its use by our group. The Fezf2 second exon was deleted in retinas by crossing Fezf2flox/flox and Six3-Cre mice. The retina-specific knockout of Fezf2 was identified by PCR genotyping using three primers located in exon 1–3 of Fezf2 as described before (21.Han W. Kwan K.Y. Shim S. Lam M.M. Shin Y. Xu X. Zhu Y. Li M. Sestan N. TBR1 directly represses Fezf2 to control the laminar origin and development of the corticospinal tract.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3041-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The loss of Fezf2 expression was further confirmed by quantitative PCR (q-PCR) or Western blotting in one eye, whereas the counterpart eye from the same embryo was taken for the knockout study. Mouse pups were put on ice to induce hypothermia while pregnant dams were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Eyes from prenatal mice were enucleated under a dissecting microscope and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde. All tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4 °C, frozen by liquid nitrogen vapor, and then embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Tissue Tek, Torrance, CA). Cryosections of 16 μm were mounted on Superfrost microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) for in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. We performed IF staining in developing retinas to determine the expression of molecular markers of retinal cells. Cryosections of retinas were washed and blocked at room temperature for 2 h in a blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum plus 1% BSA, 0.2% glycine, 0.2% lysine, and 0.3% Triton). The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The antibodies used in this study were mouse anti-SMI32 (1:200, Covance, 14942601), goat anti-BRN3B (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-31989), rabbit anti-MATH5 (1:200, Abcam, ab78046), rabbit anti-ISLET1 (1:200, Abcam, ab20670), rabbit anti-caspase III (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 9622), goat anti-BRN3A (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-31984), and rabbit anti-FEZF2 (1:500, Abcam, ab69436). The samples were processed with secondary antibodies: CyTM3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and dylightTM549-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a 1:400 dilution. Fluorescence images were taken using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Nonradioactive RNA in situ hybridizations of Fezf2 were performed as described previously (18.Chen J.G. Rasin M.R. Kwan K.Y. Sestan N. Zfp312 is required for subcortical axonal projections and dendritic morphology of deep-layer pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17792-17797Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The digoxigenin-labeled Fezf2 riboprobe (corresponding to nucleotides 1241–1734 of NM_080433) was generated by in vitro transcription from a linearized TopoII-Fezf2 plasmid. The cryosections were hybridized with the probe in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 4× SSC, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 μg/ml tRNA, 7.5% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 500 μg of salmon sperm DNA) overnight at 65 °C. After high-stringency post-hybridization washes, the hybridization signal was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate chromogen (Roche). Hybridization pictures were taken with a Nikon microscope (SMZ1500) and an Olympus microscope (EX41). For in vivo inhibition of Fezf2 expression, we used Zfp312 siRNA-1 and Zfp312 siRNA-2 with targeting sequences GGAGAACTCGGCCTTGACA at 775–793 and GGTGTTCAATGCTCACTAT at 886–904 of the coding region of Fezf2, respectively. The scrambled scRNA-1 and scRNA-2 were created by introducing three mutations in the target sequences. The Zfp312 siRNA-1 and its scramble were cloned in the lentiviral vector pLVTH, whereas Zfp312 siRNA-2 and its scramble were created on the basis of pCGLH. All constructs were verified in a previous study of Fezf2 functions in the cerebral cortex (18.Chen J.G. Rasin M.R. Kwan K.Y. Sestan N. Zfp312 is required for subcortical axonal projections and dendritic morphology of deep-layer pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17792-17797Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For Fezf2 expression, full-length Fezf2 was cloned into pCAGEN (Addgene), which harbors a CAG promoter. For ChIP, a V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) was inserted into Fezf2-pCAGEN and pCAGGS-GFP following the startup codon ATG of Fezf2 and GFP, respectively, by PCR in-frame cloning. To measure the promoter activity in the 5′ regulatory region of Brn3b, a conservative 1-kb fragment upstream from the starting site of Brn3b was amplified by PCR using primers tcgctttcttccttctctgaa and cggcaataatctaataatagctgtcaa. The PCR product was cloned into pGL4.18, a promoterless firefly luciferase vector co-expressing a neomycin resistance gene (Promega). Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were transfected with the pGL4.18 promoter and cultured in the presence of G418 for 2 months to select cells stably expressing the plasmid. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing prior to the in vivo and in vitro experiments. Plasmids were delivered to the developing retina by retinal in utero electroporation (23.Garcia-Frigola C. Carreres M.I. Vegar C. Herrera E. Gene delivery into mouse retinal ganglion cells by in utero electroporation.BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 103Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, E13.5 pregnant mice were anesthetized and attached to a clean table. The abdominal cavity was opened to expose the uterine horns. DNA solution (4 μg/μl in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 0.1% fast green) were injected through the uterus wall using a polished pulled glass micropipette. The head of each embryo was placed between tweezer-type electrodes, and five square electric pulses (38 V, 50 ms) were passed at 1-s intervals using a BTX electroporator. The wall and skin of the abdominal cavity were aligned and sutured. The embryos were allowed to develop in vivo until E17.5 or postnatal day 7 (P7). Then the mice were sacrificed to remove the brains together with the eyes for fixation in paraformaldehyde. To study the effect of Fezf2, we isolated E17.5 retinas from Fezf2-siRNA-transfected mice. Retinas were peeled from the eyeballs and collected under a stereomicroscope (Zeiss). The tissues were minced and incubated with 0.05% trypsin for 8 min at 37 °C. Single cell suspensions were prepared by trituration, suspension, and filtration. GFP+ cells were separated by FACS using a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and were taken for measuring gene expression by q-PCR. To quantitate the gene expression of Fezf2 and Brn3b, we synthesized cDNA from the RNA isolated from the retina (SuperScriptTM first-strand synthesis system, Invitrogen). q-PCR was performed using an ABI 7900 system (Applied Biosystems) and monitored on the basis of SYBR Green I dye detection with the primer sets for Fezf2 (accatggtctccagggaag and tcggaacgcatctccttg) and Brn3b (tcgctttcttccttctctgaa and cggcaataatctaataatagctgtcaa). The primer sets are unique to the targeted genes and do not map to any other genes in the mouse genome according to a BLAST search. Gene expression levels were normalized to the reference gene Actin. The Ct value was defined as the number of PCR cycles required for the fluorescent signal to grow beyond a threshold. ChIP was performed by following the protocol of the EZ ChIP kit (Millipore, 17-371). N2a cells were transfected with pCAG-V5-Fezf2 and pCAG-V5-GFP. The cells were cross-linked with 1% paraformaldehyde and lysed on ice. The lysates were sonicated to shear the chromatin and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-V5 antibody bound to Dynal protein A/G beads (1:10, Abcam, ChIP grade ab9116). The precipitate from V5-FEZF2 and V5-GFP in Dynabeads was extensively washed and eluted at 65 °C for 15 min with elution buffer (1% SDS and 10% 1 m NaHCO3 in H2O). The eluted protein-chromatin complexes were reverse-cross-linked by incubation with 5 m NaCl overnight at 65 °C. Both ChIPed and input DNA were treated with RNaseA and proteinase K, followed by DNA purification. To determine whether FEZF2 binds to Brn3b genomic DNA, we amplified a tentative regulatory region of Brn3b (−315∼+310) (chr8, 78436342–78436967) by PCR with a primer set (GTGCAGGCTGCCTGCGTGA and CCGAAGCACCGACCTGGCTAG). The input DNA from the transfected cells was taken as a positive control for gel analysis of ChIP DNA. In a similar manner, the region covering FEZF2 binding motifs (CAGCAACC) (−230∼−137) was examined by q-PCR with primers (GCAGGCTCCGGTCCTT and ACAGCAGAGCGCCTGC). A part of the 3′ UTR of Brn3b (1507–1595) was amplified as a negative control by primers (ACCGGAATTGTTTTCTGATAGC and CTTTCCCTTCGCCCTCTTT). For all q-PCRs and the luciferase assay, data were presented as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments with duplication of reading. For cell counting from immunostaining, mean ± S.D. were calculated from 12 sections on the basis of three to four samples (eyes). The control and experimental groups were compared by independent samples t test using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc.) (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.0005). Retinal cells are generated consecutively from neuroepithelium in the optic cup starting from E11.5 and continuing into the early postnatal period (24.Ohsawa R. Kageyama R. Regulation of retinal cell fate specification by multiple transcription factors.Brain Res. 2008; 1192: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). RGCs are the first born retinal cells generated from mid- to late gestation (24.Ohsawa R. Kageyama R. Regulation of retinal cell fate specification by multiple transcription factors.Brain Res. 2008; 1192: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25.Farah M.H. Neurogenesis and cell death in the ganglion cell layer of vertebrate retina.Brain Res. Rev. 2006; 52: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We measured the expression of Fezf2 in the retina by RNA in situ hybridization. Fezf2 signals were not detected in the E12.5 retina but appeared by E14.5 and E16.5, when massive RGC production occurred (25.Farah M.H. Neurogenesis and cell death in the ganglion cell layer of vertebrate retina.Brain Res. Rev. 2006; 52: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of Fezf2 was diminished by P1 and disappeared at P7 (Fig. 1A), when RGC generation was completed. Fezf2 mRNA was expressed in the inner neuroblast layer (NBL) of the retina but not detected clearly in the outer neuroblast layer, a presumptive ganglion cell layer (GCL) (Fig. 1B). Compared with the neocortex, the retina had a relatively weaker expression of Fezf2 (Fig. 1C). The temporal expression pattern of Fezf2 suggests that this transcription factor may be involved in regulating RGC development. Although Fezf2 mRNA was hardly detected in the GCL of the developing retina when assayed by in situ hybridization, the FEZF2 protein was found in the GCL at E16.5, as revealed by IF (Fig. 2A). FEZF2 was co-localized with BRN3B (Fig. 2B), a marker protein of RGCs, indicating FEZF2 expression in the developing RGCs. The discrepancy in the location of Fezf2 mRNA and protein is likely caused by the transient expression in the migrating neurons. FEZF2 protein may start to be transcribed from the transiently expressed gene in the NBL and, with a possibly long half-life, accumulate in post-migratory neurons in the GCL. The presence of FEZF2 in the GCL allows the protein to participate in regulating the development of post-mitotic neurons in the retina. The Fezf2 expression pattern is akin to that of MATH5. A knockin lacZ at the Math5 locus was expressed throughout the retina, including the GCL, despite Math5 mRNA appearing only in the NBL at E15.5 (11.Brown N.L. Patel S. Brzezinski J. Glaser T. Math5 is required for retinal ganglion cell and optic nerve formation.Development. 2001; 128: 2497-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of Fezf2 in RGC development, we analyzed Fezf2-null retinas generated by crossing Fezf2flox/flox and Six-3-Cre mice. Fezf2 deletion was confirmed by the presence of the inserted loxp and absence of the Fezf2 second exon, as determined by genotyping PCR (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, expression of Fezf2 decreased in the isolated null retina compared with the control on E17.5 (Fig. 3C). Knocking out Fezf2 attenuated Brn3b mRNA levels (Fig. 3C) and reduced BRN3B protein in the isolated retina (Fig. 3D). The number of BRN3B+ cells was reduced in the retinal sections from knockout mice (Fig. 3E). The wild-type retina had 42.6 ± 3.0 BRN3B+ cells (per field, ×40) in the GCL, which decreased to 23.8 ± 2.1 when Fezf2 was deleted (Fig. 3F). We also noticed an almost complete reduction of BRN3B+ cells in the NBL (Fig. 3, E and F). A few BRN3B+ cells scattered in the NBL of wild-type mice represent the newly generated ganglion cells en route to the GCL. Previous studies have established that Brn3b is required for preventing nascent RGCs from apoptotic cell death during retinal development (5.Gan L. Wang S.W. Huang Z. Klein W.H. POU domain factor Brn-3b is essential for retinal ganglion cell differentiation and survival but not for initial cell fate specification.Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26.Farah M.H. Easter Jr., S.S. Cell birth and death in the mouse retinal ganglion cell layer.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 489: 120-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated apoptotic cells in control and Fezf2-null retinas by the activation of CASPASE III. The cells with activated CASPASE III were found in the GCL of the Fezf2−/− retina (Fig. 3E). The Fezf2-deleted retina had 2.5-fold more CASPASE III+ cells than the wild type at E17.5 (Fig. 3G), when maximum apoptosis occurs in Brn3b knockout mice (5.Gan L. Wang S.W. Huang Z. Klein W.H. POU domain factor Brn-3b is essential for retinal ganglion cell differentiation and survival but not for initial cell fate specification.Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The number of apoptotic cells in the Fezf2 knockout retina is comparable with that in the Brn3b-deleted retina at E17.5 (5.Gan L. Wang S.W. Huang Z. Klein W.H. POU domain factor Brn-3b is essential for retinal ganglion cell differentiation and survival but not for initial cell fate specification.Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The increase in apoptosis in the Fezf2−/− retina suggests that Fezf2 is needed for the proper function of Brn3b in the developing retina. The reduction of RGC marker BRN3B was similarly observed in the P7 retina. In Fezf2-null retinas, BRN3B+ cells were reduced to about 47.3% of those in wild-type littermates (Fig. 4, A and B). As an alternative approach to determining the cell types that reduced in Fezf2−/− retinas, we immunostained retinas with anti-SMI-32, which predominantly labels the axons of RGCs (6.Gan L. Xiang M. Zhou L. Wagner D.S. Klein W.H. Nathans J. POU domain factor Brn-3b is required for the development of a large set of retinal ganglion cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 3920-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, Fezf2−/− retinas had a decreased population of SMI-32 immunoreactive processes, suggesting a loss of RGC axons. Consistently, the optic nerve appeared thinner in the Fezf2-deleted retina compared with the control (Fig. 4D). In addition, we noticed that axons from Fezf2 knockout RGCs occasionally bifurcated within the retina (Fig. 4C), reminiscent of aberrant axonal trajectories as seen in the Brn3b knockout retina (27.Badea T.C. Cahill H. Ecker J. Hattar S. Nathans J. Distinct roles of transcription factors brn3a and brn3b in controlling the development, morphology, and function of retinal ganglion cells.Neuron. 2009; 61: 852-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). All of these results support the hypothesis that the transient expression of Fezf2 is essential for the proper expression of Brn3b and formation of RGCs. Fezf2 knockout reduced BRN3B+ RGCs in the retina, either as direct effects of inhibition of Brn3b expression or as effects of developmental changes leading to loss of BRN3B+ RGCs indirectly. To determine whether the lo"
