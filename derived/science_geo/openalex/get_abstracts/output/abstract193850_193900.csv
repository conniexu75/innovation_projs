https://openalex.org/W2056261505,"IN the course of an investigation of the potential lysogenic powers of B. megaterium strains isolated recently from fæcal and soil samples, one of the strains studied (No. 216) showed a particular effect. When a highly diluted broth culture of this strain was mixed with a heavy suspension of a phagesensitive B. megaterium strain (‘mutilate’), and plated on yeast extract agar containing casein hydrolysate, no phage plaques were seen, but the colonies of the strain 216 were surrounded by a small clear halo. To study this effect, young aerated cultures of the strain grown in yeast extract–casein hydrolysate broth were lightly irradiated with ultra-violet light and reincubated. The turbidity of these cultures increased after irradiation up to the end of the second hour; then a lysis of the bacteria set in, which became almost complete in three hours. The bacterial lysate thus obtained does not contain phage particles when tested in the usual way. On the other hand, if one drop of various dilutions (up to a few thousands) of the lysate was put on the surface of a yeast extract–casein hydrolysate agar plate heavily seeded with B. megaterium, it caused a clear spot with no bacterial growth on the site of the drops. There was no reproduction of the antibacterial principle (which we propose to call ‘megacine’) in the sensitive bacteria, which fact excludes its phage character."

https://openalex.org/W2042148443,"IT has recently been reported1 that liquid anhydrous fluoride is a powerful solvent for a wide variety of proteins. It has now been found that the lower perfluoro-aliphatic carboxylic acids possess solvent properties for proteins very similar to those of hydrogen fluoride. Thus it has been observed that trifluoroacetic acid (m.p. – 15.6° C, b.p. 72° C.) readily dissolves the proteins lysozyme, ribonuclease, trypsin, pepsin, crystallized egg albumin, bovine plasma albumin, bovine plasma globulin, edestin, peanut protein globulin, casein, zein, urease, uricase, blood fibrin, insulin, silk fibroin, hide collagen and rat-tail tendon. Solutions in the concentration-range 20–30 mgm./ml. of the above proteins can easily be prepared at 25° C. Solutions of proteins in trifluoroacetic acid prepared in vacuo are clear and colourless; on exposure to air, a purple colour develops. Cytochrome c, hæmoglobin and catalaes are also soluble; solutions of these iron-containing proteins are browner in colour than are the corresponding solutions in hydrogen fluoride."

It is known that both ammonia and carbon dioxide are toxic to fish in high enough concentration, and that they are rendered more toxic by lowering the concentration of dissolved oxygen1, 2. A study of the toxicity to fish of water containing both these substances when the concentration of dissolved oxygen was low, but not lethal, was thought desirable."
