https://openalex.org/W1981149366,"Combined phylogenetic and chromosomal location studies suggest that the orphan receptor RDC1 is related to CXC chemokine receptors. RDC1 provides a co-receptor function for a restricted number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates, in particular for the CXCR4-using HIV-2 ROD strain. Here we show that CXCL12, the only known natural ligand for CXCR4, binds to and signals through RDC1. We demonstrate that RDC1 is expressed in T lymphocytes and that CXCL12-promoted chemotaxis is inhibited by an anti-RDC1 monoclonal antibody. Concomitant blockade of RDC1 and CXCR4 produced additive inhibitory effects in CXCL12-induced T cell migration. Furthermore, we provide evidence that interaction of CXCL12 with RDC1 is specific, saturable, and of high affinity (apparent KD ≈ 0.4 nm). In CXCR4-negative cells expressing RDC1, CXCL12 promotes internalization of the receptor and chemotactic signals through RDC1. Collectively, our data indicate that RDC1, which we propose to rename as CXCR7, is a receptor for CXCL12.

In concert with surface adhesion molecules, chemokines are secreted proteins that govern the migration of distinct leukocyte subsets to sites of inflammation and to their specific niches in lymphoid organs (1Nelson P.J.

Two main subfamilies are distinguished according to the position of the first two cysteines, which are separated by one amino acid (CXC chemokines) or are adjacent (CC chemokines) (4Zlotnik A.

CKRs share >20% sequence identity, and their interactions with chemokines are highly promiscuous and often redundant (6Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K.

The orphan receptor RDC1, which was originally cloned on the basis of its homology with conserved domains of G protein-coupled receptors (7Libert F. Parmentier M. Lefort A. Dinsart C. Van Sande J.

In fact, combined phylogenetic and chromosomal location studies suggested that RDC1 represents a CKR structurally close to CXC receptors (12Heesen M. Berman M.A. Charest A. Housman D. Gerard C.

The RDC1 gene maps to mouse chromosome 1 and human chromosome 2, where the genes encoding CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4 are localized (12Heesen M. Berman M.A. Charest A. Housman D. Gerard C. Dorf M.E.

Like CXCR4, the only known receptor for the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12, RDC1 can serve as coreceptor for certain genetically divergent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus strains, in particular for the HIV-2 ROD, an X4-tropic isolate (17Shimizu N. Soda Y. Kanbe K. Liu H.Y. Mukai R. Kitamura T. Hoshino H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This suggests that both CKRs interact with a conserved domain of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, which displays some similarities with chemokines, for binding to CKRs and signaling in T cells (18Shimizu N.

Antibodies, Reagents, and Cells—FITC-conjugated anti-human CD3 (clone SK7, IgG1) and PE-conjugated anti-human CXCR4 (clone 12G5, IgG2a) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were from BD Biosciences. The generation of the mouse anti-human RDC1 mAb (clone 9C4, IgG1) is described elsewhere. 7S. Infantino, B. Moepps, and M. Thelen, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the N terminus of human RDC1 (first 27 amino acids) was fused with carrier proteins, and the recombinant fusion proteins were used for immunization of mice. Positive hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a synthetic peptide (DYSEPGNFSDISWPC) corresponding to amino acids 7-21 of RDC1, designated here as RDC1-(7-21) (see Fig. 2A). The binding of unconjugated anti-RDC1 and anti-CXCR4 (12G5, BD Biosciences) mAbs was revealed using a FITC- or a PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 Ab (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with the CellQuest software. CXCL12, CXCL12-(4-67), and the C-terminal end biotinylated CXCL12 (biot-CXCL12) were kindly provided by Dr. F. Baleux (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Interleukin-8/CXCL8, BCA-1/CXCL13 and 6Ckine/CCL21 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PBLs were isolated from heparin-treated blood samples of healthy volunteers as described (20Balabanian K.

The A0.01 T-cell (from Dr. H. T. He, Centre d'Immunologie de Luminy, Marseille, France) and 300.19 murine pre-B cell lines were cultured in complete RPMI medium. RDC1 and CXCR4 Expression Vectors and Functional Assays—The human RDC1, ΔRDC1, and CXCR4 cDNAs were cloned into the pTRIP vector (kindly provided by Dr P. Charneau, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and expressed in cells as specified in the legends to Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5. Briefly, transient expression was achieved either by the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method or by using Nucleofector™ technology (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany), whereas stable expression was obtained following a lentiviral-based strategy as described (20Balabanian K. Lagane B. Pablos J.L. Laurent L. Planchenault T. Verola O. Lebbe C. Kerob D. Dupuy A. Hermine O. Nicolas J.F. Latger-Cannard V. Bensoussan D. Bordigoni P. Baleux F. Le Deist F. Virelizier J.L.

The ΔRDC1 product was engineered by polymerase chain reaction and lacks the last C-terminal 39 residues (325stop). Competition assays of mAbs with chemokines or RDC1-(7-21) for binding to CKRs were adapted from (21Brelot A. Heveker N. Montes M. Alizon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23736-23744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, competition of mAb (used at 2 or 5 μg/ml) binding by chemokines or RDC1-(7-21) was performed at 4 °C for 90 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% γFc, and 0.1% NaN3. Bound mAbs in treated cells were quantified by flow cytometry as follows: [receptor geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of treated cells/receptor geometric MFI of untreated cells] × 100. Specific binding of CXCL12 to RDC1 was evaluated using the biot-CXCL12 in A0.01 T cells that lack endogenous RDC1 and CXCR4 at both mRNA (data not shown) and protein (see Figs. 2B and 5A) levels. These cells also lack cell surface heparan sulfates that are known to bind CXCL12. For saturation binding experiments, RDC1-expressing A0.01 cells (2.5 × 105) were maintained at room temperature for 90 min in binding buffer (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3) in the presence of increasing concentrations of biot-CXCL12. Following a washing step with ice-cold binding buffer, specifically bound biot-CXCL12 was subsequently revealed by incubating cells at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml streptavidin (SAv)-PE conjugate (BD Biosciences) in binding buffer for 20 min. Cells were then washed once and fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde. Results were analyzed by flow cytometry. Specific binding was estimated by subtracting from the total binding the nonspecific binding determined either in the presence of unlabeled CXCL12 at 10-6 m (in RDC1-expressing cells) or following the binding of biot-CXCL12 to parental cells. For competition experiments, 7.5 × 10-10 m biot-CXCL12 was used as the tracer in the presence of increasing concentrations of untagged CXCL12. Binding parameters (KD and IC50) were determined with the Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) using non-linear regressions applied to one-site models. Ki values were deduced according to the Cheng and Prusoff equation Ki = [IC50/(1 + (L/KD))], where L is the concentration of biot-CXCL12 used in competition binding experiments. Receptor internalization and chemotaxis assays were performed as described (20Balabanian K. Lagane B. Pablos J.L. Laurent L. Planchenault T. Verola O. Lebbe C. Kerob D. Dupuy A. Hermine O. Nicolas J.F. Latger-Cannard V. Bensoussan D. Bordigoni P. Baleux F. Le Deist F. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F.

Statistical analyses consisted of unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests and were conducted with the Prism software.FIGURE 4RDC1 is down-regulated in response to CXCL12.

B, 300.19 pre-B cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of CXCL12 or left untreated and stained with the anti-RDC1 mAb (empty histograms) or the IgG1 control mAb (gray histograms). C, cell surface expressions of CXCR4, RDC1, and ΔRDC1 in nucleoporated dermal fibroblasts were determined by flow cytometry using the anti-CXCR4 or the anti-RDC1 mAb (empty histograms) or the corresponding isotype-matched control Ab (gray histograms). D, receptor expression levels in untreated (UNT; open bar) or treated with 2 × 10-7 m CXCL12 for 45 min at 37 °C are shown. Results are representative from two independent experiments performed in duplicate and indicate the amount of receptors that remains at the cell surface after incubation with CXCL12. 100% corresponds to receptor expression at the surface of cells incubated in medium alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5CXCL12 triggers chemotactic signals through RDC1. A, cell surface expression levels of CXCR4 and RDC1 in nucleoporated A0.01 T cells were determined by flow cytometry using the 12G5 anti-CXCR4 or 9C4 anti-RDC1 mAb (red histograms). Nonspecific binding was assessed after incubation of cells with the corresponding isotype-matched control Ab (CTRL; gray histograms) or in the presence of the 9C4 anti-RDC1 (in CXCR4-expressing cells; left section, green histogram) or 12G5 anti-CXCR4 (in RDC1-expressing cells; right panel, green histogram) mAb. A representative experiment of five independent determinations is shown. B, concentration-dependent chemotaxis of A0.01 T-cells expressing either CXCR4 (open bars) or RDC1 (filled bars) is shown in response to CXCL12. C, A0.01 T-cells expressing RDC1 or CXCR4 were treated for 90 min with the indicated Abs and then tested for CXCL12 (10 nm)-induced chemotaxis. D, CXCR4- or RDC1-expressing A0.01 T-cells were assayed for chemotaxis in response to 10 nm CXCL12 or N-terminal truncated CXCL12-(4-67), 30 nm CXCL8, 60 nm CCL21, or 100 nm CXCL13. B-D, results are expressed as the percentage of input A0.01 cells that migrated to the lower chamber and represent the mean ± S.E. of 3-5 independent experiments. The parental A0.01 T cell line was unresponsive to CXCL12. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005 compared with cells that migrated spontaneously (B and D) or in the presence of CXCL12 and the appropriate isotype control Ab (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunofluorescence—PBLs (2 × 105) were plated in RPMI medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips for 3 h at 37 °C and fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained at room temperature with the anti-CXCR4 or anti-RDC1 mAb (10 μg/ml) for 30 min followed by FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse Ab (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the FITC-conjugated anti-human CD3 mAb and finally mounted in Vectashield medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). For competitive experiments, cells were incubated at 4 °C with a mAb to CXCR4 or RDC1 (2 μg/ml) in the presence of 10 μm CXCL12. Fluorescence was imaged on a Zeiss microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using a Plan Apochromat 100×, 1.4 oil immersion objective. Images were collected with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Axiocam MRm), piloted by Axiovision imaging software (Zeiss). Optical sectioning was performed according to the structured illumination principle using the ApoTome system (Zeiss). CXCL12-induced Chemotaxis of T lymphocytes Is Inhibited by an Anti-RDC1 mAb—Like CXCR4, the RDC1 gene is ubiquitously expressed in non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic tissues, and its mRNA is found in brain, heart, kidney, spleen, and PBLs (7Libert F.

DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We investigated by immunofluorescence whether RDC1 is expressed in leukocytes using a mAb raised against human RDC1 (9C4). Leukocytes including CD3+ T lymphocytes (Fig. 1A) were stained either with the 9C4 anti-RDC1 mAb or 12G5 mAb, which recognizes an epitope in the second extracellular loop of CXCR4 (23Endres M.J. Clapham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Turner J.D. McKnight A. Thomas J.F. Stoebenau-Haggarty B. Choe S. Vance P.J. Wells T.N. Power C.A. Sutterwala S.S. Doms R.W. Landau N.R. Hoxie J.A.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the concomitant addition of 10 μm CXCL12 abolished staining of CXCR4 with mAb 12G5. Interestingly, a molar excess of CXCL12 also prevented the 9C4 mAb from binding to T lymphocytes (Fig. 1A, lower sections). As cell migration features chemokine responses, we asked whether the 9C4 mAb could interfere with the CXCL12-stimulated chemotaxis of T lymphocytes. The chemotactic effect of 30 nm CXCL12 was inhibited by 40-50% in the presence of the 9C4 anti-RDC1 mAb or the 12G5 anti-CXCR4 mAb (10 μg/ml). When added together, both mAbs produced an additive inhibitory effect that extends up to 70% of the CXCL12-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 1B). By contrast, migration of lymphocytes in response to CCL21 (Fig. 1B) or CXCL13 (data not shown) was not affected by the addition of anti-RDC1 and anti-CXCR4 mAbs. These findings suggest that RDC1 is expressed at the surface of T lymphocytes and contributes to cell migration toward the CXCL12 gradient. However, the physiological role of RDC1 in T cell migration remains to be determined. Interestingly, CXCL12 displaces the binding of the anti-RDC1 mAb, which reacts with the N terminus of RDC1. Sequence alignment reveals that the N termini of CXCR4 and RDC1 display amino acid similarities and encompass acidic and aromatic residues (Fig. 2A) that are known to be critical for CXCR4 to bind human immunodeficiency virus gp120 and CXCL12 (26Farzan M.

These findings suggest that CXCL12 interacts with the N terminus of RDC1. CXCL12 Binds to RDC1—To confirm that the 9C4 mAb specifically recognizes RDC1, we first assessed whether the synthetic peptide RDC1-(7-21), which encompasses the epitope recognized by the 9C4 mAb, prevents binding of the mAb to the receptor. In A0.01 cells that lack endogenous expression of RDC1 and CXCR4, ectopic expression of RDC1 restored binding of the 9C4 mAb (Fig. 2B, right section, red histogram and Fig. 5A, right section) but not that of the anti-CXCR4 12G5 mAb (data not shown and Fig. 5A). Conversely, ectopic expression of CXCR4 promoted binding of the 12G5 mAb but not that of the anti-RDC1 9C4 mAb (Fig. 2B, left section, and see Fig. 5A, left section). When pre-incubated with RDC1-(7-21), the 9C4 mAb (5 μg/ml) was found to be impaired in its ability to recognize RDC1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, right section). We further evidenced that the 9C4 anti-RDC1 mAb bound to HEK 293T cells expressing the receptor (Fig. 2C, right section, red histogram) but not to the parental cells (data not shown) or to CXCR4-expressing (Fig. 2C, left section, green histogram) or CCR5-expressing (data not shown) cells. Conversely, the anti-CXCR4 12G5 (Fig. 2C, right section) or anti-CCR5 2D7 (data not shown) mAb did not label cells that expressed RDC1 alone. These findings indicate that the 9C4 mAb specifically recognizes RDC1. We then investigated the interaction between CXCL12 and RDC1 by assessing the ability of the chemokine to compete with the binding of the 9C4 mAb to RDC1. CXCL12 displaced the 9C4 as well as the 12G5 mAbs used at 2 μg/ml from binding to their respective receptors in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C-D). In contrast, CXCL12 did not modulate the binding of the anti-CCR5 mAb 2D7 on CCR5-expressing HEK 293T cells, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β/CCL4 did not prevent binding of mAbs to RDC1 or CXCR4 (data not shown). Truncation of the N terminus of CXCL12, which occurs upon cleavage by proteases, results in analogs that display reduced affinity for CXCR4 and a limited ability to trigger intracellular signaling (5Loetscher P. Clark-Lewis I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 881-884PubMed Google Scholar, 27Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D.

CXCL120-(4-67), which lacks the first three Lys1-Pro2-Val3 residues, displaced binding of the mAb 12G5 to CXCR4, but less efficiently than full-length CXCL12 did (Fig. 2D, left section). This CXCL12 derivative also moderately competes for the binding of the 9C4 mAb to RDC1 (Fig. 2D, right section), thus providing evidence of the involvement of the N terminus of CXCL12 in the binding to RDC1. To directly assess binding of CXCL12 to RDC1, we performed binding experiments using biot-CXCL12 (Fig. 3). The binding of biot-CXCL12 to cells expressing RDC1 was revealed with the SAv-PE conjugate and then quantitated by flow cytometry (Fig. 3, A and C). We found that binding of biot-CXCL12 to RDC1-expressing A0.01 cells was specific, dose-dependent, saturable, and of high-affinity (apparent KD = 0.4 ± 0.1 nm; Fig. 3, A and B). This affinity is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that estimated for CXCR4 (27Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of biot-CXCL12 assessed either in A0.01 parental cells or in the presence of CXCL12 at 10-6 m was found to be minimal (Fig. 3B). When added at increasing concentrations, untagged CXCL12 displaced binding of 7.5 × 10-10 m biot-CXCL12 to RDC1-expressing A0.01 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 = 5 ± 1.8 nm (apparent Ki = 1.8 ± 0.7 nm; Fig. 3, C and D). Overall, this demonstrates that RDC1 is a high affinity receptor for CXCL12. CXCL12 Induces Down-regulation of RDC1—Receptor internalization is a widely described process that occurs upon chemokine stimulation (29Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We thus investigated CXCL12-induced internalization of RDC1. Treatment of pre-B 300.19 cells expressing human RDC1 with increasing concentrations of CXCL12 induced a dose-dependent internalization of RDC1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, 2 × 10-7 m CXCL12 induced down-regulation of RDC1 expressed on dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 4, C and D) or on Chinese hamster ovary K1 or A0.01 cells (data not shown). By contrast, RDC1 was not internalized in response to two other CXC chemokines, CXCL8 and CXCL13 (data not shown). Agonist-induced CKR internalization generally relies on the phosphorylation of C-terminal Ser/Thr residues that, in turn, promotes binding of β-arrestins for targeting to clathrin-coated pits (30Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The C-terminal sequence of RDC1 contains multiple Ser/Thr residues (Fig. 2A) that could serve as structural determinants for receptor internalization. Fig. 4D shows that truncation of the RDC1 C terminus (ΔRDC1) abolished CXCL12-induced internalization, indicating that endocytosis requires the integrity of this domain. These results support the view that Ser/Thr residues of the RDC1 C terminus are subjected to phosphorylation by second messenger-dependent kinases and/or G protein-coupled receptor kinases in response to agonist. This finding is reminiscent to those reported for the internalization of other CKRs including CXCR4 (31Signoret N. Oldridge J. Pelchen-Matthews A. Klasse P.J. Tran T. Brass L.F. Rosenkilde M.M.

CXCL12 Promotes Cell Migration through RDC1—We tested the ability of CXCL12 to trigger chemotaxis of A0.01 T-cells expressing either RDC1 or CXCR4 (Fig. 5A). Addition of the chemokine resulted in a dose-dependent migration of RDC1-positive cells (Fig. 5B). The magnitude of this process was comparable with that of CXCR4-positive cells, with a maximum migration obtained at 10-8 m CXCL12. CXCL12 also triggers chemotactic signal through the truncated ΔRDC1 receptor (data not shown), indicating that an intact receptor C terminus is not required for chemotaxis. This finding highlights that the structural determinants required for RDC1-mediated chemotaxis may differ from those involved in receptor internalization, as reported for other CKRs (34Venkatesan S.

The 9C4 mAb strongly inhibited migration of RDC1-expressing cells but did not modify that of cells expressing CXCR4 (Fig. 5C). Conversely, the anti-CXCR4 12G5 mAb abolished chemotaxis of cells expressing CXCR4 but had no effect on CXCL12-promoted migration of cells expressing RDC1 alone. These results confirm that CXCL12 triggers chemotactic signals directly through RDC1. CCL21, CXCL8, CXCL13 (Fig. 5D), CCL4, RANTES (regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed and secreted)/CCL5 (data not shown), or CXCL12-(4-67) (Fig. 5D) did not promote chemotaxis of RDC1-expressing cells. Taken together, our data indicate that, in cells ectopically expressing RDC1, CXCL12 binds to and signals via RDC1 and further suggest that activation of RDC1 by CXCL12 requires the intact N terminus of the chemokine. Conclusions—Collectively, our data demonstrate that the orphan receptor RDC1 is a high affinity receptor for CXCL12. Currently, six CXC receptors have been characterized and, according to the nomenclature for CKR families (6Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that RDC1 be renamed as CXCR7. The highly conserved sequences of RDC1 and CXCL12 among species suggest that CXCL12/RDC1 interactions may have conserved functional significance. However, the responsiveness of RDC1 to CXCL12 is intriguing because of the nearly identical phenotypes of CXCR4- and CXCL12-deficient mice. The notion that both CXCR4 and CXCL12 knock-out mice die perinatally and display profound defects in hematopoiesis and cerebellar development was generally interpreted as a monogamous relationship between CXCR4 and CXCL12 (36Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar, 37Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T. Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9448-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The interaction between CXCL12 and RDC1 opens questions about the role of this receptor during embryonic life. RDC1 may function in organogenesis and hematopoiesis in concert with CXCR4. Alternatively, but not exclusively, RDC1 may exert distinct activities to those of CXCR4. To this end, it would be important to understand the spatio-temporal regulation and distribution of RDC1 in embryonic tissues. In post-natal life, as shown for CXCR4, our results are also consistent with a possible role of RDC1 in CXCL12-mediated regulation of CD34+ stem cell homing in the bone marrow and leukocyte trafficking (38Peled A.

To cope with ER stress, mammalian cells trigger a specific response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although recent studies have indicated cross-talk between ER stress and oxidative stress, the mechanistic link is not fully understood. By using murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells, in which tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death, we show that TNFα induces the UPR in a ROS-dependent fashion. In contrast to TNFα, oxidative stresses by H2O2 or arsenite only induce eukaroytic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation, but not activation of PERK- or IRE1-dependent pathways, indicating the specificity of downstream signaling induced by various oxidative stresses. Conversely, the UPR induced by tunicamycin substantially suppresses TNFα-induced ROS accumulation and cell death by inhibiting reduction of cellular glutathione levels. Collectively, some, but not all, oxidative stresses induce the UPR, and pre-emptive UPR counteracts TNFα-induced ROS accumulation.

Once ER function is perturbed by various pathological conditions, newly synthesized unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, resulting in ER stress. To cope with accumulated unfolded ER proteins, mammalian cells trigger a specific response termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 2Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). There are three distinct signaling pathways that are triggered in response to ER stress, mediated by PERK, ATF6, and IRE1. Under non-pathological conditions, all three components associate with the abundant lumenal chaperon Bip (also known as glucose-regulated protein 78) and this interaction keeps these signaling molecules in an inactive state (4Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 5Liu C.Y. Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Once unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, Bip preferentially associates with the unfolded proteins instead of PERK, ATF6, and IRE1, resulting in activation of their downstream signaling molecules. PERK is an ER-resident serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) (6Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α subsequently inhibits protein synthesis to prevent further influx of nascent proteins into an already saturated ER lumen. Paradoxically, eIF2α phosphorylation induces translation of a transcription factor ATF4 and subsequent expression of the ATF4 target genes, GADD34 and CHOP (7Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). The second signaling pathway is mediated by the basic leucine zipper-type transcription factor, ATF6. ATF6 is synthesized as a type II transmembrane precursor protein with a molecular mass with 90 kDa (p90 ATF6), and anchored to the ER membrane where it is retained by Bip. In response to ER stress, ATF6 is released from Bip and transported to the Golgi complex (8Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), where ATF6 undergoes sequential cleavages by two proteases, S1P and S2P (9Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). The processed form of ATF6 (p50ATF6) translocates to the nucleus and binds to the ER stress responsive element (ERSE), and subsequently activates target genes. Many ER chaperons, including Bip, glucose-regulated protein 94, and calreticulin, contain an ERSE in their promoter regions and are induced by ATF6 (10Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The third signaling pathway is composed of IRE1 and XBP1. IRE1 is a type I transmembrane protein containing a serine threonine kinase and ribonuclease domains. Under normal conditions, only the unspliced form of XBP1[XBP1(U)] mRNA is translated, but its product is a weak transcriptional activator with a short protein half-life. Upon ER stress, IRE1 is activated and cuts 26 nucleotides out from XBP1(U) mRNA to generate spliced XBP1[XBP1(S)] mRNA, which encodes the more stable and transcriptionally active XBP1(S) protein. XBP1(S) binds to the unfolded protein response element (UPRE) and activates target genes (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 12Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D.

Cell. 2001; 107: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). There are four known kinases, including PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI, that phosphorylate eIF2α (2Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 14Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). PKR is activated by double-stranded RNA and phosphorylates eIF2α during viral infection. GCN2 and HRI play the equivalent role in amino acid-starved cells and hemedeprived reticulocytes, respectively. However, the kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylating eIF2α in response to oxidative stress remain to be identified (15Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study has revealed an intimate correlation between ER stress and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). Whereas tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-linked glycosylation, only weakly induced accumulation of ROS in wild-type cells, the same treatment induced marked accumulation of ROS in cells lacking PERK or ATF4. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that the PERK- and ATF4-dependent pathways induce genes associated with amino acid transport and reduced glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, which might be responsible for elimination of ROS. Although accumulating evidence has indicated cross-talk between oxidative stress and ER stress response pathways, its detailed molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. By using murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells, in which TNFα induces ROS accumulation, we have investigated whether TNFα induces the UPR, and whether preemptive activation of the UPR induced by tunicamycin could affect ROS accumulation induced by TNFα. Here we show that TNFα, but not H2O2 or arsenite, induces the UPR in a ROS-dependent fashion, revealing the specificity of downstream signaling components induced by various oxidative stresses. Moreover, the UPR induction by pretreatment with tunicamycin substantially inhibits TNFα-induced ROS accumulation and cell death. Given that ER stress induces accumulation of ROS in PERK or ATF4 knockout (KO) cells to greater levels than wild-type cells (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C.

Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar), the UPR normally functions to counteract ROS accumulation induced by various stresses, including ER stress itself and TNFα, to protect cells from cell death. Reagents and Cell Culture—Recombinant murine and human TNFα were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Antibodies (Abs) specific for phospho-eIF2α, total eIF2α, XBP1, Bip, and α-tubulin were purchased from Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Stressgen, and Sigma. Anti-PERK and anti-ATF6 Abs were generated as described previously (6Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar, 10Yoshida H. Haze K.

Tunicamycin, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), sodium arsenite, 5- (and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA), and dihydroethidium (DHE) were purchased from Calbiochem, Wako Pure Chemicals, and Molecular Probes. L929 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells, wild-type, RelA KO, and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2 and TRAF5 double KO (DKO) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Western Blot Analysis—L929 cells (5 × 105) were stimulated with TNFα or tunicamycin in the absence or presence of BHA for the indicated time periods, and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation, cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were probed with Abs to phospho-eIF2α, total eIF2α, and XBP1. To confirm the equal loading of the lysates, the membranes were reprobed with anti-α-tubulin Ab. The membranes were developed with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting Detection System Plus (Amersham Biosciences). To detect phosphorylation of PERK, L929 cells (3.5 × 106) were unstimulated or stimulated with TNFα or tunicamycin in the presence or absence of BHA. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PERK Ab, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE. The membranes were probed with anti-PERK Ab and developed by ECL as described above. To detect detergent-insoluble Bip, L929 cells (3.5 × 106) were unstimulated or stimulated with TNFα or tunicamycin in the absence or presence of BHA for the indicated time periods. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C for 30 min. The suspensions were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were used as detergent-soluble fractions. The insoluble pellet fractions were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and then solubilized in 1% SDS buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 350 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% sucrose, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatants were used as detergent-insoluble fractions. The equal amounts of protein (50 μg for the detergent-soluble fractions, and 100 μg for detergent-insoluble fractions) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Bip Ab. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Shindo M. Nakano H. Kuroyanagi H. Shirasawa T. Mihara M. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Yagita H. Okumura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). L929 cells and wild-type MEFs were stimulated with TNFα or tunicamycin for the indicated time periods in the absence or presence of BHA. cDNA probes for GADD34, XBP1, and β-actin were prepared by RT-PCR, and 32P-labeled with Rediprime™ kit (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization, radioactive signals were analyzed on BAS2500 (Fuji Photo Film) using Image Gauge software (Fuji) and normalized based on the signal of β-actin. Analysis of XBP1 mRNA Splicing by IRE1—RNAs were reverse transcribed using Oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen), and amplified using sense primer mXBP1.3S (5′-AAACAGAGTAGCAGCGCAGACTGC-3′) and antisense primer mXBP1.2AS (5′-GGATCTCTAAAACTAGAGGCTTGGTG-3′) to generate cDNA product encompassing the IRE1 cleavage sites as previously described (12Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). The unspliced and spliced mRNAs generate 480- and 454-bp cDNA products, respectively. These fragments were further digested by PstI to check whether a PstI restriction site was lost after IRE1-mediated splicing of mRNA. The cDNA fragments were resolved on 2% agarose gel. cDNA products from the unspliced mRNA yielded two short fragments (289 and 191 bp) after digestion. Measurement of ROS Accumulation—L929 (4 × 105) cells were plated in 6-well plates and stimulated with TNFα, H2O2, or arsenite for the indicated time periods. After stimulation, the cells were incubated with phenol red-free medium (Opti-MEM) (Invitrogen) containing CM-H2DCFDA (1 μm) or DHE(1 μm) in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, the cells were harvested and analyzed on a flow cytometer (FAC-SCalibur, BD Biosciences). Data were processed by using the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Reporter Assay—L929 cells (2 × 106) were transiently transfected with pGL3-5 × ATF6 (18Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol.

Wild-type MEFs (2 × 105) and HeLa cells (5 × 105) were transiently transfected with pGL3-5 × ATF6 or pGL3-Bip (-132/+7) along with pRL-TK by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with TNFα for 8 h or tunicamycin for 18 h in the presence or absence of BHA. The luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a luminometer (Berthold). pRL-TK, Herpesvirus-derived thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase expression plasmid, was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—Duplex siRNAs with two nucleotides overhang at the 3′-end of the sequence were purchased from Qiagen. The target sequences were as follows: murine PERK, 5′-GGUAAUGCGGGAAGUUAAA-3′; green fluorescent protein (GFP), 5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′. L929 cells (3 × 106) were transfected with the indicated siRNAs using a Nucleofector according to a manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa). Transfection efficiency was determined by counting GFP-positive cells using flow cytometry after transfection with an expression vector for GFP. Electron Microscopy—L929 cells (4 × 106) were unstimulated or stimulated with TNFα or tunicamycin in the presence or absence of BHA for 6 h, and then serially fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h and then with 2% OsO4 for 2 h before embedding in Epon 812. Thin sections were prepared using a MT-5000 ultramicrotome (Dupont Pharmaceuticals), stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and then observed (×5,000 or 15,000) on a JEM1230 electron microscope (JEOL). Measurement of GSH—Cellular GSH levels were measured by using a colorimetric assay kit (OxisResearch™) as previously described (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). WST Assay—L929 (1 × 104), RelA KO (5 × 103), or DKO (5 × 103) cells were plated in 96-well plates and untreated or pretreated with tunicamycin for 12 h. The cells were washed to remove residual tunicamycin, then stimulated with TNFα for an additional 16 h. Cell viability was determined by WST assay using a Cell Counting kit (Dojindo) as previously described (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. TNFα Induces the UPR in L929 Cells—Treatment of cells with oxidative agents such as arsenite and heavy metal ions has been shown to induce oxidative stress and eIF2α phosphorylation (20Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, it is still controversial whether oxidative stresses induced by various agents elicit the UPR. Given that TNFα induces ROS accumulation in murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells (21Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether TNFα induces eIF2α phosphorylation in L929 cells. We stimulated L929 cells with TNFα or tunicamycin for 2-10 h and examined eIF2α phosphorylation using Ab specific for the phosphorylated form of eIF2α. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was detected at 4 h and persisted up to 10 h after tunicamycin stimulation (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, eIF2α phosphorylation was also induced at 2 h and persisted up to 10 h after TNFα stimulation. Because eIF2α phosphorylation subsequently induces ATF4 and GADD34 (2Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), we next examined the induction of GADD34 mRNA after TNFα stimulation by Northern blot analysis. TNFα, as well as tunicamycin, induced GADD34 mRNA in L929 cells (Fig. 1B). Notably, eIF2α phosphorylation and the induction of GADD34 mRNAs after TNFα treatment were faster than those after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that TNFα induces a pathway initiated by phosphorylation of eIF2α and followed by the up-regulation of GADD34. In addition to eIF2α phosphorylation, ER stress activates the ATF6-dependent pathway that subsequently induces the expression of many genes containing the ERSE in the promoter regions, including Bip, calnexin, calreticulin, and XBP1 (10Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 22Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Upon ER stress, ATF6 is converted from a 90-kDa protein (p90ATF6) to a 50-kDa protein (p50ATF6), resulting in nuclear translocation. Thus, we examined whether TNFα induces p50ATF6 by Western blotting using anti-ATF6 Ab (22Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Although the induction levels of p50ATF6 by TNFα were weaker than tunicamycin, TNFα substantially induced p50ATF6 with a peak at 4 h after stimulation (Fig. 1A). We then examined whether TNFα induces the expression of XBP1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, TNFα as well as tunicamycin markedly increased the expression of XBP1 mRNA, indicating that TNFα also activates the ATF6-dependent pathway. ER stress also activates the IRE1-dependent pathway (11Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 12Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D.

Cell. 2001; 107: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Activated IRE1 cuts out 26 nucleotides of the unspliced XBP1[XBP1(U)] mRNA to generate the spliced XBP1[XBP1(S)] mRNA, which encodes transcriptionally active XBP1(S) with a molecular mass of 50 kDa. The RT-PCR products produced from the spliced and unspliced XBP1 mRNA can be easily detected following PstI digestion of PCR products generated using primers flanking the XBP1 intron, because the unspliced product contains a PstI site that is lost in the spliced product (12Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, PstI-digested fragments of the RT-PCR products were detected prior to stimulation, and these fragments decreased at 4 h and were no longer present at 6 h after tunicamycin stimulation. Residual undigested fragments prior to stimulation may reflect the basal level of IRE1 activation as reported previously (23Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). TNFα treatment also resulted in accumulation of XBP1(S) mRNA as seen by the presence of PstI-resistant RT-PCR products beginning at 2 h and continuing through 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 1C). We also examined whether TNFα induces XBP1(S) protein expression by Western blotting using anti-XBP1 Ab. Consistent with the RT-PCR analysis, the kinetics of TNFα-induced expression of XBP1(S) were faster than those of tunicamycin induction (Fig. 1A). Combined together, these data indicate that TNFα treatment induces the full UPR in L929 cells. The TNFα-induced UPR Is ROS-dependent—To investigate the contribution of ROS to TNFα-induced UPR in L929 cells, we examined the inhibitory effect of the antioxidant, BHA, on the TNFα-induced UPR. We previously demonstrated that BHA has a stronger antioxidant activity than N-acetyl-l-cysteine (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 24Pia J.-H. Xue X. Nakajima A. Sasazuki T. Okumura K. Nakano H. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 2004; 8: 163-174Google Scholar). Indeed, BHA completely inhibited TNFα-induced ROS accumulation in L929 cells (Fig. 2A). We then examined the effect of BHA on TNFα-induced UPR in L929 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, BHA significantly inhibited eIF2α phosphorylation and the up-regulation of XBP1(S). Moreover, BHA almost completely inhibited induction of GADD34 and XBP1 mRNAs (Fig. 2C). We next tested the inhibitory effect of BHA on the splicing of XBP1 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2D, BHA significantly inhibited TNFα-induced disappearance of the unspliced XBP1 mRNA. These results indicate that TNFα-induced UPR in L929 cells is mediated by ROS. In contrast to TNFα-induced UPR, the tunicamycin-induced UPR has both ROS-dependent and -independent components. Tunicamycin-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of GADD34 mRNA were not significantly inhibited by BHA (Fig. 2, B and C). However, BHA weakly and transiently inhibited induction of XBP1 mRNA and protein expression, but not splicing of XBP1 mRNA (Fig. 2, B-D). These results suggest that antioxidants have little effect on preventing PERK and IRE1 activation, and a modest effect on inhibiting ATF6-dependent up-regulation of XBP1 mRNA. We have previously shown that TNFα does not induce ROS accumulation in wild-type MEFs (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Then, we therefore examined whether TNFα induces the UPR in wild-type MEFs. Whereas tunicamycin induced phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 2G), the expression of GADD34 and XBP1 mRNAs (Fig. 2E), splicing of XBP1 mRNA (Fig. 2F), XBP1(S) (Fig. 2G), and TNFα did not up-regulate any of these molecules in wild-type MEFs. These results substantiate that ROS play an essential role in inducing the UPR by TNFα. TNFα Activates Promoters Containing the UPRE and ERSE in a ROS-dependent Fashion—Taken that TNFα induces the UPR in L929 cells in a ROS-dependent fashion, we next examined whether TNFα activates the promoter activities of ER stress-responsive genes. Overexpression of truncated XBP1(S) or p50ATF6 activates promoters containing an ER stress responsive element termed the UPRE, which was originally identified as a binding sequence of ATF6 in vitro (18Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether TNFα up-regulates transcriptional activity of a promoter containing the UPRE, we transiently transfected L929 cells with the pGL3-5 × ATF6 plasmid containing 5 copies of the UPRE, and stimulated the cells with TNFα or tunicamycin. Consistent with the induction of XBP1(S) by TNFα (Fig. 1A), TNFα increased the reporter activity to 2.5-fold compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 3A). Importantly, BHA treatment completely inhibited TNFα-induced 5 × ATF6 reporter gene activity, indicating that ROS were essential for the UPRE-dependent transcriptional activation by TNFα. Interestingly, tunicamycin-induced 5 × ATF6 reporter gene activity was also partially inhibited by BHA (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with its partial inhibitory effect on the induction of XBP1(S) (Fig. 2B). We next examined whether TNFα activates the 5 × ATF6 reporter gene activity in other types of cells. Consistent with the finding that TNFα does not induce ROS accumulation in wild-type MEFs (19Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) or HeLa cells (data not shown), TNFα did not induce the 5 × ATF6 reporter gene activation in either wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3C) or HeLa cells (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, BHA treatment only marginally inhibited tunicamycin-induced 5 × ATF6 reporter gene activation in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3C) and HeLa cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that the contribution of ROS to tunicamycin-induced UPR activation is variable among cell types. In addition to the UPRE, expression of ER stress responsive genes, such as Bip and calreticulin is regulated by another element, termed the ERSE. Thus, we next examined whether TNFα also activates the promoter activity of Bip (10Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). To this end, we transiently transfected L929 cells with pGL3-Bip (-132/+7) containing three ERSE sites and stimulated the cells with TNFα or tunicamycin. TNFα weakly, but substantially activated the Bip reporter gene activity, and this activation was inhibited by BHA (Fig. 3E). Similarly, tunicamycin-induced Bi"

R., Dreier, B., and Barbas, C. F., III (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 1495–1500). Such proteins provide the basis for the construction of artificial transcription factors to study gene/function relationships in the post-genomic era. Central to the universal application of this approach is the development of zinc finger domains that specifically recognize each of the 64 possible DNA triplets. Here we describe the construction of a novel phage display library that enables the selection of zinc finger domains recognizing the 5′-ANN-3′ family of DNA sequences. Library selections provided domains that in most cases showed binding specificity for the 3-base pair target site that they were selected to bind. These zinc finger domains were used to construct 6-finger proteins that specifically bound their 18-base pair target site with affinities in the pm to low nm range. When fused to regulatory domains, these proteins containing various numbers of 5′-ANN-3′ domains were capable of specific transcriptional regulation of a reporter gene and the endogenous humanERBB-2 and ERBB-3 genes. These results suggest that modular DNA recognition by zinc finger domains is not limited to the 5′-GNN-3′ family of DNA sequences and can be extended to the 5′-ANN-3′ family. The domains characterized in this work provide for the rapid construction of artificial transcription factors, thereby greatly increasing the number of sequences and genes that can be targeted by DNA-binding proteins built from pre-defined zinc finger domains.

One practical application of the development of a protein-DNA recognition system is the construction of artificial transcription factors that might be used to purposefully regulate gene expression. We have demonstrated that gene expression can be specifically altered through the use of designed polydactyl zinc finger transcription factors that bind 18 base pairs (bp)1 of DNA sequence. Because of their extended DNA recognition site, these proteins have the potential to be genome-specific transcriptional regulators (1Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl.

Targeting of only 9 bp of sequence can also result in gene regulation wherein chromatin structure provides for an additional level of specificity (3Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H.

Because a universal system for gene regulation would provide many new opportunities in basic and applied biology and medicine, the development of such a system is of considerable interest. Two key features have made Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains the most promising DNA recognition motifs for the construction of artificial transcription factors, modular structure, and modular recognition. Each domain consists of ∼30 amino acids and folds into a ββα structure stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and the chelation of a zinc ion by the conserved Cys2-His2 residues (5Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar, 6Lee M.S. Gippert G.P. Soman K.V. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1989; 245: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). DNA recognition of typically 3 bp is provided by presentation of the α-helix into the major groove of DNA. Binding of longer DNA sequences is achieved by covalent tandem repeats of these domains. We have reported previously the phage display selection of zinc finger domains that recognize each of the 5′-GNN-3′ DNA subsites and the refinement of these domains by site-directed mutagenesis (7Segal D.J.

These domains can be assembled to create polydactyl zinc finger proteins that recognize extended 18-bp DNA sequences (1Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to imposing constitutive transcriptional regulation on endogenous genes, these transcription factors can be made hormone-dependent by fusion to designed ligand-binding domains prepared from a variety of nuclear hormone receptors (9Beerli R.R. Schopfer U. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32617-32627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To allow for the rapid construction of zinc finger-based transcription factors that bind any DNA sequence, it is important to extend the existing set of modular zinc finger domains such that recognition of all 64 DNA triplets is possible. Phage display selection and/or rational design are approaches that might be used to achieve this aim. Whereas there are now numerous structural studies of zinc finger proteins in complex with DNA, the data are insufficient to allow for the rational design of zinc finger domains that bind any given trinucleotide subsite (10Pavletich N.P.

Furthermore, only few zinc finger domains that bind to sequences of the type 5′-ANN-3′ are found in naturally occurring proteins, like finger 5 (5′-AAA-3′) of Gfi-1 (19Zweidler-McKay P.A. Grimes H.L. Flubacher M.M. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), finger 3 (5′-AAT-3′) of YY1 (20Hyde-DeRuyscher R.P. Jennings E. Shenk T.

Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Analysis of the reported zinc finger/DNA structures, however, provides insights into the design of libraries of zinc fingers that might bind any given DNA subsite. To date, the best characterized member of the Cys2-His2 family of zinc finger proteins is the mouse transcription factor Zif268. The molecular interaction of Zif268 with its target DNA 5′-GCG-(T/G)GG- GCG-3′ has been characterized in great detail (10Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 11Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1996; 4: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Zif268-DNA complex and related complexes suggests that DNA binding of each domain is achieved predominantly by interaction of the side chains of the amino acid residues displayed on its α-helix at positions −1, 3, and 6 (AA−1, AA3, AA6) with the 3′-, middle, and 5′-nucleotide of a 3-bp DNA subsite, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Direct interaction of the helix with all three bases of the DNA subsite has not been observed. Typically, only 1 or 2 bases of the 3-bp subsite are specified by residues in the α-helix (11Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O.

Although these studies have revealed a variety of direct interactions between residues at helical positions −1 and 3 and the 3′- and middle nucleotides, respectively, the only direct interaction observed with an amino acid residue in position 6 of the α-helix and the 5′-nucleotide is an Arg6 or Lys6 to 5′-guanine. Therefore, the optimal residue(s) that should be used at position 6 for recognition of DNA target sequences of the type 5′-ANN-3′, 5′-CNN-3′, or 5′-TNN-3′ is not known. While positions −1, 3, and 6 play critical roles in DNA recognition, the other residues of the helix are important in domain stability and in some cases for DNA recognition. Leucine, for example, is the relatively conserved amino acid residue typically found at helical position 4 in zinc fingers of this type. The side chain of this residue packs into the hydrophobic core of the domain and is believed to be key in stabilizing the domain. Positions 1 and 5 of the α-helix have been shown to make direct or water-mediated contacts with the phosphate backbone of the DNA. A particularly important role in base recognition, as it relates to the development of modular recognition domains that bind non-5′-GNN-3′ sequences, is played by the side chain of residue 2. In Zif268, aspartic acid is found at position 2 of each α-helix and plays a role in determining base specificity at two positions. By making a pair of buttressing hydrogen bonds with Arg−1 within the same helix, this residue acts to stabilize the Arg−1 to 3′-guanine interaction within the 3-bp recognition site of the domain. This conclusion is supported by structural observations and mutagenesis studies (8Dreier B. Segal D.J. Barbas III, C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 11Elrod-Erickson M.

A. 1997; 94: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is the role this residue plays in specifying base identity at another position that limits domain modularity in recognition. In finger 3 for example, the carboxylate of Asp2 can accept a hydrogen bond from the N-4 of cytosine or the N-6 of adenine that is base-paired to the 5′-guanine or -thymine, respectively, of the finger-2 subsite (10Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 11Elrod-Erickson M. Rould M.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O.

A. 1997; 94: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consequently, Zif268 does not discriminate well between 5′-GGG-3′ and 5′-TGG-3′ at the finger-2 subsite, and recognition of 5′-AGG-3′ or 5′-CGG-3′ is precluded. A similar interaction is seen between the Asp2 of finger 2 and the corresponding base within the finger-1 recognition site. This cross-strand contact to a base outside the canonical three-nucleotide recognition site effectively restricts the identity of the base that can be recognized at the 5′-position of the binding site of the preceding finger. Thus, whereas modularity of DNA recognition is a key feature of zinc finger domains, domain-independent modular interaction is not always complete. This type of constraint to zinc finger specificity and modularity, referred to as the target site overlap problem, has been the subject of much discussion (24Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 3: 183-212Google Scholar, 25Segal D.J. Barbas C.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Pabo C.O. Nekludova L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 597-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, the design of zinc finger domains that bind 5′-ANN-3′ DNA sequences is constrained by a lack of information regarding residues required for specification of a 5′-adenine. Selections with Zif268-derived libraries are constrained by the target site overlap problem engendered by the Asp2 of finger 3 or finger 2. Consequently, our previously constructed libraries are best suited for selection of domains that bind 5′-GNN-3′ or 5′-TNN-3′ sequences (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 27Wu H. Yang W.-P. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). One approach to overcome the limitations imposed by target site overlap in the selection of novel recognition domains involves the randomization of amino acid residues in two adjacent fingers (28Jamieson A.C. Wang H. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12834-12839Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Isalan M. Klug A. Choo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12026-12033Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A second approach involves the sequential selection of fingers 1 to 3 for each particular 9-bp target site and has led to the development of several 5′-ANN-3′ recognition domains (30Greisman H.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1997; 275: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Wolfe S.A. Greisman H.A. Ramm E.I. Pabo C.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1917-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Neither of these approaches, however, provides for the selection of zinc finger domains that act as independent recognition units but rather provides domains that are dependent on inter-domain interactions for their specificity. In this study we have taken an approach designed to enforce modularity of DNA recognition within zinc finger domains with the goal of pre-defining domains that can be used for the rapid construction of artificial transcription factors without the need for additional phage display selections. Here we describe the application of this new strategy to select zinc finger domains that recognize the 5′-ANN-3′ family of DNA sequences. The specific DNA-binding properties of these domains are evaluated using multitarget binding assays that employ all 16 5′-ANN-3′ triplets. Selection and specificity data coupled with molecular modeling are used to provide new insights into zinc finger/DNA interactions. We demonstrate that these domains can be readily incorporated into polydactyl proteins containing various numbers of 5′-ANN-3′ domains and that these proteins specifically recognize extended 18-bp sequences. Furthermore, we have explored the ability of these proteins to regulate a reporter gene as well as the endogenous human genes ERBB-2 and ERBB-3. These results underscore the prospects of constructing polydactyl proteins from pre-defined building blocks. Construction of the zinc finger library was based on the earlier described C-7 protein ((27); Fig. 1 A). Finger 3 recognizing the 5′-GCG-3′ subsite was replaced by a domain binding to a 5′-GAT-3′ subsite (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) via a PCR overlap strategy using a primer coding for finger 3 (5′-GAGGAAGTTTGCCACCAGTGGCAACCTGGTGAGGCATACCAAAATC-3′) and a vector-specific primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGC-3′). Randomization of the zinc finger library by PCR overlap extension was essentially as described (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 27Wu H. Yang W.-P. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The library was ligated into the phagemid vector pComb3H (32Rader C. Barbas III, C.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Growth and precipitation of phage were performed as described previously (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Binding reactions were performed in a volume of 500 µl of zinc buffer A (ZBA: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 90 µm ZnCl2), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Blotto (Bio-Rad), 20 µg of double-stranded, sheared herring sperm DNA containing 100 µl of precipitated phage (1013 colony-forming units). Phage were allowed to bind to non-biotinylated competitor oligonucleotides for 1 h at 4 °C before the biotinylated target oligonucleotide was added. Binding continued overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with 50 µl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal; blocked with 5% Blotto in ZBA) for 1 h, beads were washed 10 times with 500 µl of ZBA, 2% Tween 20, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and once with buffer containing no Tween. Elution of bound phage was performed by incubation in 25 µl of trypsin (10 µg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Hairpin competitor oligonucleotides had the sequence 5′-GGCCGCN′N′N′ATCGAGTTTTCTCGATNNNGCGGCC-3′, where NNN represents the finger-2 subsite oligonucleotides and N′N′N′ its complementary bases. Target oligonucleotides were biotinylated and usually added at 72 nm in the first three rounds of selection and then decreased to 36 and 18 nm in the sixth and last round. As competitor a 5′-TGG-3′ finger-2 subsite oligonucleotide was used to compete with the parental clone. An equimolar mixture of 15 finger-2 5′-ANN-3′ subsites, except for the target site and competitor mixtures of each finger-2 subsites of the type 5′-CNN-3′, 5′-GNN-3′, and 5′-TNN-3′ were added in increasing amounts with each successive round of selection. Usually no specific 5′-ANN-3′ competitor mix was added in the first round. The zinc finger-coding sequence was subcloned from pComb3H into a modified bacterial expression vector pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs) (35Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). After transformation into XL1-Blue (Stratagene) the zinc finger-maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions were expressed by addition of 1 nm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Freeze/thaw extracts of these bacterial cultures were applied in 1:2 serial dilutions to 96-well plates coated with streptavidin (Pierce) and were tested for DNA binding specificity against each of the 16 5′-GAT ANN GCG-3′ target sites. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed essentially as described (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After incubation with a mouse anti-MBP antibody (Sigma, 1:1000), a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, 1:1000) was applied. Detection occurred by addition of alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma), and theA 405 was determined by a microtiter plate reader with SOFTMAX2.35 (Molecular Devices). Gel shift analysis was performed with purified protein (Protein Fusion and Purification System, New England Biolabs) essentially as described (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Finger-2 mutants were constructed by PCR as described (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F.

Biol. 2000; 303: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As PCR template the pMal vector encoding for C7.GAT was used. PCR products containing a mutagenized finger 2 and 5′-GAT-3′ finger 3 were subcloned via NsiI andSpeI restriction sites in frame with finger 1 of C7 (5′-GCG-3′) into a modified pMal-c2 vector (New England Biolabs). Three-finger proteins were constructed by finger-2 stitchery using the SP1C framework as described (1Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The proteins generated in this work contained helices recognizing 5′-GNN-3′ DNA sequences (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), as well as 5′-ANN-3′ and 5′-TAG-3′ helices described here. Six finger proteins were assembled via compatible XmaI and BsrFI restriction sites. Analysis of DNA-binding properties were performed using freeze/thaw extracts from from IPTG-induced bacteria. For the analysis of the capability of these proteins to regulate gene expression, they were fused to the activation domain VP64 or repression domain KRAB of Kox-1 as described earlier ((1, 2); VP64, tetrameric repeat of the herpes simplex virus VP16 minimal activation domain) and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or the retroviral pMX-IRES-GFP vector ((36Liu X.

Cells were transfected with 160 ng of reporter plasmid (pGL3; Promega) containing the promoter sequence with zinc finger-binding sites and 40 ng of effector plasmid (zinc finger-effector domain fusions in pcDNA3) in 24-well plates. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and measured with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a MicroLumat LB96P luminometer (EG & Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). These assays were performed as described (2Beerli R.R. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As primary antibody an ErbB-1-specific mAb EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ErbB-2-specific mAb FSP77 (gift from Nancy E. Hynes (37Harwerth I.M. Wels W. Marte B.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15160-15167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and an ErbB-3-specific mAb SGP1 (Oncogene Research Products) were used. Fluorescently labeled donkey F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Computer models were generated using InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Models were based on the coordinates of the co-crystal structures of Zif268-DNA (Protein Data Bank code 1AAY) and QGSR-GCAC (Protein Data Bank code1A1H). The structures were not energy-minimized and are presented only to suggest possible interactions. Hydrogen bonds were considered plausible when the distance between the heavy atoms was 3 (±0.3) Å. and the angle formed by the heavy atoms and hydrogen was 120o or greater. Plausible van der Waals interactions required a distance between methyl group carbon atoms of 4 (±0.3) Å. Selections of one our previously reported phage display libraries for modular zinc finger domains that bind to 3-bp DNA sites containing 5′-nucleotides other than guanine or thymine have met with no success (data not shown). This phage display library (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) was based on C7, a high affinity variant of the mouse transcription factor Zif268 also selected by phage display (27Wu H. Yang W.-P. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). It is believed that selections of this library for modular recognition domains of these specificities failed due to the cross-subsite interaction from Asp2 of the finger-3 recognition helix RSD-E-LKR (corresponding to helical positions −1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In order to overcome the limitations to selections of novel finger-2 domains imposed by target site overlap, we sought to eliminate the transgressing finger-3 interaction. First, finger 3 of C7 (RSD-E-RKR) that binds to subsite 5′-GCG-3′ was exchanged with a domain that does not contain aspartate in position 2 (Fig.1 A). The helix TSG-N-LVR, previously characterized in the finger-2 position to bind with high specificity to the triplet 5′-GAT-3′, appeared to be an optimal candidate since Gly2 does not possess a side chain capable of the type of interactions observed for Asp2 (7Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This 3-finger protein (C7.GAT; Fig. 1 A), containing finger 1"

In addition, serine phosphorylation at various sites of the p65 subunit has been shown to be important in initiating transcription. Here we demonstrate that the regulation of nuclear translocation of p65 phosphorylated at serine 536 is not dependent on IκBα. Stimulation of either Jurkat or normal human T cells resulted in the nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 (Ser536). In addition, the phospho-p65 (Ser536) was not associated with either IκBα or p50, and the nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 (Ser536), but not total p65, was unaffected by the proteosome inhibitor MG-132, which blocks IκB protein degradation and prevents p65/p50 dimer nuclear translocation. Accordingly, the co-expression of a dominant negative mutant of IκBα blocked the transcriptional activity mediated by wild type but not the dominant positive p65 mutant (S536D). Furthermore, the transfection of the S536D form of p65 led to the induction of interleukin-8 transcription following stimulation, whereas the S536A form, which cannot be phosphorylated at this site, did not. Together, the findings suggest that p65 phosphorylated on serine 536 is not associated with or regulated by IκBα, that it has a distinct set of target genes, and that it may represent a noncanonical NF-κB pathway that is independent of IκBα regulation.

The NF-κB signaling pathway responds rapidly to a wide range of stimuli (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Activation leads to the translocation of the transcription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The NF-κB transcription factor consists of two subunits of either homo- or heterodimers of RelA/p65, c-Rel, and p50. The complexes are held in the cytoplasm and prevented from activating transcription by a class of proteins referred to as inhibitors of NF-κBorIκB proteins. Upon stimulation, the IκB proteins are phosphorylated by one of a number of IκB kinases (IKK-α,-β, and -γ), ubiquitinylated, and degraded, which thereby allows the NF-κB complex to translocate into the nucleus (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). However, recent findings have demonstrated the shuttling of the NF-κB complex in and out of the nucleus in the absence of stimulation (3Tam W.F. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7701-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Tam W.F. Wang W. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4837-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complex, several studies have shown that the NF-κB proteins are modified post-translationally, and those changes influence transcriptional activity. Examples of activation-induced post-translational modifications include the acetylation of p65 to facilitate the retention of the NF-κB complex in the nucleus (5Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D.

Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). In addition, the S-nitrosylation of cysteine 62 of p50 has been shown to affect the NF-κB binding to DNA (7Marshall H.E.

We have previously described the phosphorylation of various Rel proteins following the stimulation of T cells, and the phosphorylation of p50 increased the DNA binding capacity (9Li C.C. Dai R.M.

Several studies have demonstrated the phosphorylation of p65 in response to various stimuli (10Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Notebaert S. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Serine 276 of p65 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A during IκB degradation and is necessary for the recruitment of CREB-binding protein/p300 to p65 for active transcription (11Zhong H. Voll R.E.

Serine 276 is within the Rel homology domain, which is involved in dimerization, whereas the serines 529 and 536 are in the C-terminal transactivation domain. Moreover, threonine phosphorylation of p65 at residue 254 has been shown to be required for Pin1 association and the increase in p65 stability (22Ryo A. Suizu F. Yoshida Y. Perrem K. Liou Y.C.

It is not known if the phosphorylations are mutually exclusive or all three are required for active transcription. The role of phosphorylation of the serine residues 529 and 536 in the second transactivational domain has been in question with the recent data from Okazaki et al. (23Okazaki T. Sakon S. Sasazuki T. Sakurai H. Doi T. Yagita H. Okumura K. Nakano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants of the serines either individually or together did not result in a loss of transcriptional activity, which suggested that the phosphorylation of the serine residues was not necessary for p65 transactivational activity. The data herein describes the nuclear translocation of p65 phosphorylated on serine 536 following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (PI) or TNF stimulation in Jurkat cells. The phosphorylation of p65 did not increase following activation in either Jurkat or primary T cells. Moreover, the phospho-p65 was not associated with either IκBα or p50, and the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 reduced nuclear translocation of total p65 but not phospho-p65. The overexpression of the dominant negative IκBα (DN-IκBα) mutant suppressed p65 transcriptional activity; however, the transcriptional activity of the phosphomimetic form of serine 536 (S536D) of p65 was not affected. The findings suggested that p65 phosphorylated on serine 536 translocated to the nucleus following activation, and this nuclear translocation is not regulated by IκBα. Furthermore, the data suggest that at least some genes are transcribed selectively by an NF-κB complex containing a form of p65 phosphorylated on serine 536. Cell Culture and Reagents—Jurkat clone E6–1 and HeLa were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin (QBS). Human peripheral blood T cells were collected from healthy donors who provided informed consent and enriched as previously described (24Ghosh P. Buchholz M.A. Yano S. Taub D. Longo D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4517-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of PMA (Sigma) and ionomycin (Calbiochem) were prepared in ethanol and used at 10 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml, respectively. MG-132 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and prepared in Me2SO (Sigma). Plasmids—The p65 cDNA was subcloned from pCMV-p65 (a generous gift from Dr. H. A. Young) into pEF6/V5-His (Invitrogen), and the following primers (Sigma) were used with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) to generate the site-directed mutant: S536A forward (GATGAAGACTTCTCCGCCATTGCGGACATGGAC) and reverse (GTCCATGTCCGCAATGGCGGAGAAGTCTTCATC); S536D forward (GGAGATGAAGACTTCTCCGACATTGCGGACATGGACTTC) and reverse (GAAGTCCATGTCCGCAATGTCGGAGAAGTCTTCATCTCC). Site-directed mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Lofstrand Labs Ltd., Gaithersburg, MD). The wild type and mutant p65 constructs were transiently transfected into relA –/– knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (25Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from Dr. David Baltimore), and lysates of the transfectants were processed for immunoblot analysis. The wild type pCMV-IκBα and dominant negative pCMV-IκBα M expression vectors were purchased from BD Biosciences. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) supplemented with the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 μm sodium fluoride, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Yano S. Ghosh P. Kusaba H. Buchholz M. Longo D.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2510-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with the modification of adding the aforementioned supplements. Total protein concentration in the samples was determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). 5–10 μg of sample were loaded into each well, separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with the antibodies indicated in the figure legends. The antibodies against phospho-p65 serine 536 (catalog number 3031) and phospho-IκBα serine 32 were purchased from Cell Signal (Beverly, MA) and used at the indicated concentrations as described by the manufacturer. The rabbit antibodies against p65 (40 ng/ml; C-20), Oct-1 (200 ng/ml; C-21), and IκBα (200 ng/ml; C-21) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The concentrations of the monoclonal antibodies against V5 (Invitrogen) and β-tubulin (Sigma) were used as indicated by the manufacturer. The rabbit antisera against p50 (1157) and c-Rel (265) were a generous gift from Dr. Nancy Rice and diluted 10,000-fold. The antibodies were detected by chemifluorescence and scanned with the Typhoon scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of the band intensity was done with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, samples were precleared with 2 μg of normal goat immunoglobulin and 20 μl of Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, and the precleared samples were incubated with the following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends: goat normal immunoglobulin, goat anti-p65 (C-20-g), goat anti-IκBα (C-20-g), and goat anti-p50 (C-20-g). An aliquot of the precleared sample (one-twentieth of the volume) before the immunoprecipitation reaction was designated as the input sample. After incubating for 2 h, 20 μl of Protein A/G beads were added for an additional 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysing buffer and then eluted with sample buffer. For the immunodepletion experiments, the unbound samples in the supernatant from the bound beads were subsequently immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments, this process was repeated to immunodeplete multiple proteins from a single sample. NF-κB Reporter Assay—The NF-κB reporter assay was performed as previously described (27Ghosh P. Sica A. Cippitelli M. Subleski J. Lahesmaa R. Young H.A. Rice N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7700-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids NF-κB/β-galactosidase and pGL3-luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). As indicated in the figure legends, expression plasmids of p65, p65 mutants, IκBα, and IκBα mutant were co-transfected with the reporter plasmids. After 48 h of incubation, β-galactosidase and luciferase activity were assessed with the Beta-glo and Bright-glo (Promega, Madison, WI) assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer. NF-κB transcriptional activity, as detected as β-galactosidase activity, was normalized with the luciferase activity. The relative light units and the error bars represent the average and S.D. of triplicate samples. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted as described with the following modifications (28Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells, 2 × 107 cells, were either untreated or treated with PI for the indicated time periods. The cells were fixed with formaldehyde and washed twice with PBS. The cell pellet was lysed and sonicated twice with 10 pulses on ice. After centrifugation, 1% of the extract was aliquoted and used for the total input control. The remaining extracts were precleared with protein A-agarose containing salmon sheared DNA (Upstate, Waltham, MA). The precleared samples were evenly aliquoted into four tubes containing agarose-conjugated normal rabbit Ig, anti-acetylated H4 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) grade (Upstate), agarose-conjugated anti-p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and agarose-conjugated anti-p65 (Santa Cruz) (designated total p65) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A-agarose salmon sheared DNA was added to the anti-acetylated H4 and anti-RNA polymerase II samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The unbound fraction of the anti-p50 immunoprecipitation reaction was collected and incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (designated as p50-independent p65) with salmon sheared DNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) overnight for the sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation. The subsequent steps of washing, eluting, and the purification of DNA were conducted with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate). The purified DNA was suspended in 40 μl of TE. Ten microliters were used for each PCR and amplified through 40 cycles. The PCR products were separated through an agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Samples from the anti-p65 precipitation reaction were subjected to 45 cycles of PCR, and the gels were stained with SYPRO gold (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was isolated from Jurkat cells that were transfected with 1 μg of the various p65 constructs alone or with 1 μg of DN-IκBα. The complementary DNA was generated from 1 μg of RNA using the SuperScript III reverse transcription kit and random hexamers (Invitrogen). One-hundredth of the sample was used in a real-time PCR reaction containing a 0.2 μm concentration of both forward and reverse primers (29Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitation of -fold induction was analyzed by the method described by Schmittigen et al. (30Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Mills A.G. Gorn V. Singer M.J. Reed M.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The role of serine phosphorylation at residue 536 in the regulation of the transactivation potential of p65 is not clearly defined. We investigated the status of serine 536 phosphorylation in human T cells and its role in activation-induced transcriptional activity. As seen in Fig. 1A, the activation of HeLa cells, but not Jurkat cells, resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 (henceforth referred to as phospho-p65). In addition, the activation of Jurkat cells by TNF did not induce an increase in p65 phosphorylation. Jurkat cells constitutively expressed a serine 536 phosphorylated form of p65, and this form appeared to be present mainly in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B). Upon activation, the phospho-p65 appeared in the nucleus as early as 15 min after stimulation, peaked at 30 min, and stayed in the nucleus up to 2 h. As expected, stimulation of Jurkat cells resulted in the nuclear translocation of both p65 and p50 (Fig. 1B). Regarding IκBα, the level was decreased due to the early degradation upon PI stimulation and then increased as the protein was subsequently re-expressed. The success of the fractionation process and equivalent sample loading was confirmed by detecting equal amounts of p105 and Oct-1 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, respectively. These data suggested that a serine 536 phosphorylated form of p65 was present exclusively in the cytoplasm of unstimulated Jurkat cells, and upon activation, this phospho-p65 translocated to nucleus with similar kinetics to total p65. It is conceivable that the constitutive phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 was unique to the immortal Jurkat T cell line and was not a feature of primary human T cells. To investigate this question, human peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with PI for various time points, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were collected, and phospho-p65 levels were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1B, phospho-p65 was constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm of normal human T cells. Furthermore, the levels of nuclear phospho-p65 increased following PI stimulation, and the levels of phospho-p65 were maintained throughout the 4 h of stimulation. A similar increase in nuclear p65 was observed following PI stimulation. Although a slight decrease in phospho-p65 was observed after 0.25 h of PI stimulation, the cytoplasmic levels of phospho- and total p65, in general, did not change with PI treatment. In contrast, increases in both cytoplasmic and nuclear c-Rel levels were detected following PI stimulation as described by others (31Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To verify the subcellular fractionation process, the membranes were probed for p105 and Oct-1. As seen in the middle and bottom of Fig. 2B, p105 and Oct-1 were detected in their respective cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions throughout the 4 h of PI stimulation. These results were also observed in at least in five donors, whose cells were stimulated with either PI or PMA and anti-CD28. Taken together, these findings suggested that, in Jurkat and human T cells, at least a portion of the total pool of p65 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine 536, and phospho-p65 translocates to the nucleus following stimulation. The canonical NF-κB complex is composed of a dimer of p50 and p65 and predominantly resides in the cytoplasm bound to IκBα. Upon activation, IκBα is phosphorylated, ubiquitinylated, and degraded resulting in nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). To assess the relationship between the previously shown nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 upon cell activation and the IκB pathway, cytoplasmic lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with increasing amounts of antibody to IκBα, and the unbound proteins from the first immunoprecipitations were reimmunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antiserum. Immunocomplexes from both steps were analyzed by immunoblotting with total p65 and phospho-p65. As shown in Fig. 2A, p65 was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antiserum in a dose-dependent manner (see lanes 3–5 at the top), and this interaction was specific, since immunoprecipitation with normal immunoglobulin did not produce any IκBα or p65 (see lane 2). At higher doses of anti-IκBα, immunoprecipitation of IκBα-associated p65 was complete, since no IκBα was detected in the subsequent precipitates with anti-p65 antiserum (see lanes 7–9). Surprisingly, a substantial amount of p65 was recovered from the unbound fractions by immunoprecipitation with anti-p65, indicating that only a small portion of total p65 was associated with IκBα (compare lanes 3–5 with lanes 7–9). Interestingly, reprobing the membrane with anti-phospho-p65 antiserum revealed the presence of phospho-p65 exclusively in the fractions that were not associated with IκBα (see lanes 7–9 of Fig. 2A). The presence of both IκBα and phospho-p65 in lane 6 of the top and bottom of Fig. 2A, where the unbound sample of the normal immunoglobulin control immunoprecipitation reaction was subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibody, demonstrated that the normal immunoglobulin did not react with either IκBα or p65. These data indicated that a portion of the total pool of p65 was phosphorylated at serine 536, and this phosphorylated p65 was not associated with IκBα. Since phospho-p65 was not associated with IκBα in the cytoplasm, we wanted to know whether phospho-p65 was able to form complexes with p50. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with different amounts of anti-p50 antiserum, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-p65 and anti-p65 antisera. As shown in Fig. 2B, anti-p50 antiserum was unable to co-precipitate phospho-p65, regardless of the amount of antiserum used in the immunoprecipitation (see lanes 3–5 at the top). This lack of interaction between p50 and phospho-p65 was not due to the inefficient immunoprecipitation by anti-p50 antiserum, since this antiserum was able to co-precipitate total p65 (see lanes 3–5 of both the middle and bottom of Fig. 2B). To further investigate the lack of interaction between p50 and phospho-p65, a series of sequential immunodepletions were performed with anti-p50 antiserum for three successive cycles under conditions that should preserve p50 associations with the other proteins. After the third cycle of immunodepletion, the unbound fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antiserum for two more cycles. The immunocomplexes obtained from each step were analyzed by immunoblotting using either anti-phospho p65, anti-p65, or anti-p50 antiserum (Fig. 2C). Although anti-p50 antiserum was able to significantly deplete p50-p65 complexes (see lanes 3–5 of the bottom panel), a significant amount of p65 was recovered after the third cycle of immunoprecipitation by anti-p65 antiserum (lanes 6). Interestingly, phospho-p65 was detected in the fraction that was not associated with p50, indicating that the phospho-p65 was unable to form a complex with p50. To determine whether the lack of interaction between phospho-p65 and p50 or IκBα was also seen in human peripheral blood T cells, whole cell lysates from peripheral blood T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-IκBα, anti-p50, or anti-p65 antiserum, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p65, anti-p65, anti-IκBα, and anti-p50 antisera (Fig. 2D). Although immunoprecipitation by both anti-IκBα and anti-p50 anti-sera co-precipitated IκBα, p50, p105, and p65 (lanes 3–5 of Fig. 2D, bottom), phospho-p65 was detected only in the p65-containing immunocomplex (lane 5 of top). Collectively, the data demonstrated that the phospho-p65 was not associated with either IκBα or p50. To investigate the functional consequences of the lack of interaction between phospho-p65 and IκBα, we tested the effect of the proteosome inhibitor MG-132, which has been shown to block the degradation of IκBα and the nuclear translocation of p50-p65 heterodimer (32Grisham M.B. Palombella V.J. Elliott P.J. Conner E.M. Brand S. Wong H.L. Pien C. Mazzola L.M. Destree A. Parent L. Adams J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were treated with MG-132 for 30 min before PI stimulation, and the nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 and total p65 were analyzed by Western blot analysis along with the status of IκBα (Fig. 3A). The activation-induced nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 was not affected by the pretreatment with MG-132 (compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 7–9), whereas this pretreatment inhibited the nuclear translocation of total p65 in a dose-dependent manner (compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 7–9 of the middle of Fig. 3A). The densitometric measurements of the bands of Fig. 3A were graphically represented in Fig. 3B as a ratio of phospho-p65 to total p65. These data showed that the ratio of phospho-p65 to total p65 increased with MG-132 treatment, whereas the ratio decreased in the samples treated with the vehicle Me2SO. To assess the effectiveness of MG-132 treatment, phospho-IκBα levels were analyzed in the cytoplasmic fractions. As shown in Fig. 3C, an increase in the phospho-IκBα level was detected in the vehicle-treated samples 15 min after PI treatment, and this level returned to the basal level by 30 min (see lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the samples pretreated with MG-132 possessed higher basal levels of phospho-IκBα, which were further increased upon PI stimulation and stayed up for the rest of the time they were treated (lanes 4–9). These results suggested that the activation-induced nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 was independent of IκBα-mediated regulation, a finding that reinforced the conclusion that phospho-p65 was not associated with IκBα. To investigate the contribution of serine 536 in the transactivation potential of p65, two p65 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis where serine 536 was substituted with either alanine (S536A) or aspartic acid (S536D). S536A cannot be phosphorylated at serine 536, and S536D behaves like phospho-p65. The wild type and the mutant constructs were transiently transfected into relA –/– mouse embryo fibroblasts to determine whether the phospho-p65 antiserum could distinguish the two forms. The lysates from the transfectants were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p65, and the immunoprecipitated samples were probed with the phospho-p65 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 4A, the phospho-p65 antiserum recognized only the S536D, but not the wild type and S536A, p65 construct, indicating the specificity of the phospho-p65 antiserum. The lack of reactivity of the phospho-p65 antiserum to the immunoprecipitated S536A p65 construct was not due to the lack of expression of the mutant construct, since the expressions of all of the constructs were detected by the anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 4A, bottom). Next, we transfected the different constructs into Jurkat cells and tested the transactivation potential of the construct"

Although not required for the activity of the catalytic domain, phosphorylation of the C-terminal region plays an important role in stabilizing the PTEN protein. In its phosphorylated form, the tail is thought to wrap unto the C2 and catalytic domains of PTEN and thereby block the translocation of PTEN to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (16Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 22Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), thus effectively inhibiting the dephosphorylation of the substrates of PTEN. Tail mutants of PTEN tend to have increased catalytic activity but are rapidly degraded in cells. Using a mutagenesis approach, Torres and Pulido (17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) showed that the C-terminal region of PTEN is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo between residues 369 and 386, mostly on Ser-370 and Ser-385. They also found that the Ser/Thr protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) can phosphorylate these residues in vitro as well as, to a lower extent, Ser-380, Thr-382, and Thr-383 (17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Vazquez et al. (16Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) also found that all phosphorylation of PTEN occurred in the C-terminal region (residues 354–403) and identified Ser-370 plus at least one other residue (Ser-380, Thr-382, Thr-383, or Ser-385) as the sites in vivo. They also reported that mutation of Ser-380, Thr-382, or Thr-383 to alanine reduced the half-life and increased the catalytic activity of PTEN (16Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Finally, Miller et al. (21Miller S.J. Lou D.Y. Seldin D.C. Lane W.S. Neel B.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) identified Ser-370 and Ser-385 as the major phosphorylation sites in vivo and also detected phosphate on Thr-366. They also found that CK2 readily phosphorylated Ser-370 and Ser-385 in vitro. Our own group (20Birle D. Bottini N. Williams S. Huynh H. deBelle I. Adamson E. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) studied PTEN in a different cell type, the T lymphocyte, and we found that PTEN is heavily phosphorylated at Ser-380 and Ser-385 in these cells and that both residues can affect the half-life of PTEN. Other residues were not examined. We have now refined this study using mass spectrometry, phosphospecific antibodies, tryptic peptide mapping, phosphoamino acid analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and RNA interference of kinases. These studies revealed a more complex regulation of PTEN by several kinases, which may act in concert or in response to different conditions or in different cell types. The participation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in PTEN phosphorylation in vivo suggested the possibility of PTEN regulation in a negative feedback loop or by stimuli that activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. Antibodies—Antibodies to PTEN were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), anti-CK2α′ and anti-GSK3α were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PTEN-phospho-Ser-380, anti-phospho-Thr-Pro, anti-Akt, anti-Akt-phospho-S473, and anti-GSK3α/β-phospho-21/9 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), anti-actin was from Sigma, and anti-CK2α was from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, BC, Canada), anti-PTEN-phospho-Ser-370 was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), anti-PTEN-phospho-Ser-385 was from Ana-Spec, Inc. (San Jose, CA), and anti-GSK3β was from BD Transduction Laboratories and from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 was from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Plasmids and Proteins—Constructs encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused PTEN and its phosphorylation site mutants were cloned by standard PCR and recombinant DNA methods. Briefly, fragments containing the entire open reading frame of PTEN were subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), in-frame with the (GST) polypeptide using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The phosphorylation site mutants of PTEN (S362A/T366A, S370A, S380A, S385A, S380A/385A) were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Proteins were expressed and purified according to standard techniques. Cells, Transfection, and RNA Interference—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. These cells were transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The siRNAs used for transfections were: CK2α (Dharmacon, M-003480-00-05) and CK2α′ (Qiagen, 5′-AGC UGC GAC UGA UAG AUU G-3′), GSK3β (Dharmacon, M-003009-00), and GSK3α (Dharmacon, M-003010-00-05). Cells were lysed 48 h after transfections. In initial experiments, we co-transfected a fluorescein-labeled luciferase GL2 duplex (Dharmacon, D-001120-01-20) and then sorted out the fluorescent cells. However, this did not have any significant impact on the experimental results, and this step was therefore omitted in later experiments. Experiments were also performed with Jurkat cells, as before (12Wang X. Gjörloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Pathan N. Reed J.C. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1934-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Birle D. Bottini N. Williams S. Huynh H. deBelle I. Adamson E. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 13,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For PTEN immunoprecipitation, the clarified lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads and the PTEN antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology for 3 h. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and suspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved in NovexR 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with antibodies. The blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Phosphorylation, Phosphoamino Acid Analysis, and Tryptic Peptide Mapping—For in vitro kinase assays, GST-PTEN fusion proteins were incubated with GSK3β (Upstate Biotechnology), CK1 (Promega, Madison, WI), or/and CK2α (Upstate Biotechnology) for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 0.05 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Assays without radiolabeled ATP had 1 mm cold ATP. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Tryptic peptide mapping was performed as before (23Saxena M. Williams S. Taskén K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 24Alonso A. Rahmouni S.

Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by complete acid hydrolysis in 1 m HCl, 110 °C, and separation in two dimensions in the presence of unlabeled standards. GST Pull-down Assays—For GST pull-down assays, 293T cell lysates were incubated with GST or GST-PTEN prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Mass Spectrometry—Identification of phosphorylated residues by LC-MS/MS was performed on in vitro phosphorylated GST-PTEN and digested with highest grade trypsin. The digest was injected into a high-pressure liquid chromatography instrument (LC Packings Inc.), which first separates the peptides on a reverse-phase column from which they elute directly into a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF API-US) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Waters-Micromass). Loss of CK2 Has No Impact on Phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-380 in Cells—Using a phospho-specific antibody, we recently showed that PTEN is phosphorylated at Ser-380 in Jurkat T cells and in normal human T lymphocytes (20Birle D. Bottini N. Williams S. Huynh H. deBelle I. Adamson E. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether CK2 is responsible for this phosphorylation in cells, we used RNA interference to reduce the cellular levels of the two catalytic subunits of this kinase, CK2α and CK2α′. 293T cells (which can be transfected to >80%) were first transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for each kinase separately to verify efficacy and to establish the required concentrations (not shown) and then with both siRNAs together (Fig. 1a). Two days after transfection, these cells showed an ∼90% reduction in CK2α and ∼70% reduction in CK2α′, whereas actin levels were unchanged. Cell viability and morphology also remained normal. Immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-Ser-380 antibody revealed that phosphorylation of PTEN at this site was not affected at all by this dramatic reduction in CK2 levels. CK2 Phosphorylates PTEN at Ser-370 and Ser-385 but Not Ser-380—The lack of effects of the loss of CK2 on PTEN phosphorylation at Ser-380 must mean either that very low levels of CK2 are enough to carry out a normal phosphorylation at this site or that another kinase is responsible. To first address the former possibility, we phosphorylated PTEN in vitro with CK2 and analyzed the phosphorylation by autoradiography, tryptic peptide mapping, phosphoamino acid analysis, and tandem mass spectrometry. These experiments showed that CK2 readily phosphorylated PTEN (Fig. 1b, lane 2), whereas recombinant Akt did not (Fig. 1b, lane 3), and that this phosphorylation occurred on two distinct peptides (Fig. 1c), both of which contained only phosphoserine (Fig. 1d). The two peptides migrated a very short distance on the thin layer plates, particularly in the second dimension (ascending chromatography), indicating that they are both acidic and very hydrophilic. These properties are found only in the two long C-terminal tryptic peptides corresponding to residues 350–378 and 379–402 of PTEN, the latter containing the major phosphorylation sites in PTEN in T cells, Ser-380 and Ser-385 (20Birle D. Bottini N. Williams S. Huynh H. deBelle I. Adamson E. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using PTEN proteins with either or both of these two residues mutated to alanine as substrates showed that CK2 readily phosphorylated all these proteins with some decrease observed only for PTEN proteins with Ser-385 mutated (Fig. 1e). Finally, tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 1f) detected phosphorylation of two distinct tryptic peptides at residues Ser-370 and Ser-385, respectively (Fig. 1f). In contrast, no peptide containing phosphate at Ser-380 was found. Since the same peptide with phosphate at Ser-385 was readily detected, it seemed that Ser-380 was not phosphorylated at all by CK2. Together, all these results indicated that CK2 indeed can phosphorylate PTEN very well but that it is not required for phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser-380 in intact cells. Indeed, CK2 did not phosphorylate this residue even in vitro but instead phosphorylates serine residues 370 and 385. We also found that CK2 phosphorylates only serine residues, without any trace of phosphate on threonine residues. We concluded that it is likely that additional kinases participate in the phosphorylation of PTEN at serine and threonine residues in intact cells. Phosphorylation of PTEN by GSK3β and CK1 but Not by c-Akt—Next, we tested a number of other Ser/Thr kinases for their ability to phosphorylate PTEN. As shown in Fig. 1b, recombinant Akt (which readily phosphorylated other proteins in vitro; data not shown) was unable to phosphorylate GST-PTEN. Similarly, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and the protein kinases Mek1, Erk2, and PDK1 were all unable to phosphorylate GST-PTEN (not shown). In contrast, GSK3β and CK1 incorporated substantial amounts of 32P into PTEN (Fig. 2a), albeit less than CK2. Tryptic peptide maps of PTEN phosphorylated by GSK3β showed a single spot (Fig. 2b), which was both acidic and hydrophilic, suggesting that it corresponds to either of the two C-terminal tryptic peptides of PTEN. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that GSK3β phosphorylated PTEN on both threonine and serine (Fig. 2c). Tandem mass spectrometry identified the phosphorylated residues as Ser-362 and Thr-366 (Fig. 2d). None of the several other serine or threonine residues contained any phosphate. Indeed, the PTEN-S362A/T366A mutant of PTEN was not phosphorylated at all by GSK3β in vitro (Fig. 2e). The phosphorylation of PTEN by CK1, CK2, or GSK3β in vitro was further analyzed with phospho-specific antibodies against PTEN-phospho-Ser-370 and PTEN-phospho-Ser-385 (Fig. 3a, first and second panels), which confirmed that CK2 readily phosphorylated both sites (lanes 3), whereas CK1 phosphorylated Ser-370 much less than CK2 but Ser-385 a bit better than CK2 (lanes 2). In contrast, GSK3β did not phosphorylate either site (Fig. 3a, first and second panels, lane 4). Phospho-specific antibodies against Ser-362 or Thr-366 are not available, but since Thr-366 is followed by a proline residue, we tested whether this site would react with an anti-phospho-Thr-Pro antibody. Indeed, GSK3 treatment made PTEN readily reactive with this antibody (Fig. 3a, third panel, lane 4). This reactivity was abrogated by mutation of Thr-366 (see below). CK1 was very inefficient in phosphorylating PTEN at Thr-366, whereas CK2 was not able to cause any phosphorylation at this site. Synergistic Phosphorylation of PTEN by GSK3β and CK2—GSK3β typically phosphorylates serines or threonines that are located four residues amino-terminal of an already phosphorylated residue, a pattern that fits the notion that Ser-362 becomes a good substrate once Thr-366 has first been phosphorylated. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser-370 by CK2 could have the same stimulatory effect on phosphorylation of Thr-366 by GSK3β. To directly test this possibility, we pretreated GST-PTEN with CK2, or kinase buffer alone, in the presence of unlabeled ATP, pulled down and washed the GST-PTEN protein, and then treated it with GSK3β in kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP or with kinase buffer and [γ-32P]ATP alone. The latter also served as a control to show that residual CK2 did not affect the assay. As shown in Fig. 3b, upper panel, PTEN pretreated with CK2 was severalfold more phosphorylated by GSK3β (lane 4) than PTEN pretreated with kinase buffer and ATP without CK2 (lane 2). When this experiment was repeated with GST-PTEN-S370A, the effect of CK2 pretreatment was completely lost (Fig. 3b, lower panel). Very similar results were obtained with phospho-specific antibodies; although only GSK3b was able to make PTEN reactive with the phospho-Thr-Pro antibody (i.e. phosphorylate Thr-366) (Fig. 3c, lane 4), PTEN treated with both CK2 and GSK3b became much more strongly reactive (lane 5). In contrast, PTEN-T366A/S362A did not react at all with the antibody (lane 6), and the effect of CK2 was completely lost in the PTEN-S370A mutant. Together, these experiments showed that phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 at Ser-370 efficiently promotes phosphorylation at Thr-366 by GSK3β. GSK3β Phosphorylates PTEN at Thr-366 in Intact Cells—To determine whether GSK3β participates in the phosphorylation of PTEN in intact cells, we reduced the cellular levels of GSK3β, as well as the closely related GSK3α, by RNA interference, immunoprecipitated PTEN, and probed it with the anti-phosphothreonine-proline antibody (Fig. 4a). In cells with reduced levels of both GSK3 isoforms, phosphorylation of PTEN at Thr-366 was much reduced, indicating that GSK3 is needed for this phosphorylation in intact cells. In contrast, reactivity with the phospho-Ser-370 and phospho-Ser-385 specific antibodies was not changed, and PTEN and actin levels were unaltered. We concluded that GSK3 indeed phosphorylates at least Thr-366 in intact cells. This notion was further supported by the detection of a small amount of GSK3β (as well as CK2) bound to GST-PTEN incubated with cell lysates followed by extensive washing and immunoblotting (data not shown). Inactivation of GSK3α/β by Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Stimulation Reduces PTEN Phosphorylation at Thr-366 in Cells—Next, we wanted to learn whether extracellular stimuli that affect the activity of GSK3α and β would alter the phosphorylation of PTEN by this kinase in intact cells. Insulin-like growth factor 1 is known to cause a robust activation of c-Akt, which, in turn, phosphorylates GSK3 and inactivates it. Indeed, the addition of this growth factor to our cells caused a sharp increase in phospho-Akt levels (Fig. 5a, first panel) and the appearance of GSK3α/β phosphorylated at Ser-21/Ser-9 (Fig. 5a, third panel). Concomitantly, there was a clear decrease in the reactivity of PTEN with the phospho-Thr antibody. The total levels of Akt and PTEN remained unchanged in these experiments, whereas the levels of GSK3 tended to change, at least in part due to nucleus-to-cytosol translocation of this kinase (27Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these data demonstrated that extracellular stimuli that activate the PI3K-Akt-GSK3 pathway directly influence PTEN phosphorylation at Thr-366, providing a physiological regulation of this phosphorylation of PTEN. Phosphorylation of PTEN at Thr-366 Reduces the Activity of PTEN in Cells—Finally, to evaluate whether phosphorylation at Thr-366 has any functional impact on PTEN, we expressed PTEN or the PTEN-T366A mutant in Jurkat T cells, which lack endogenous PTEN, and measured their effects on the phosphorylation of Akt. In these experiments, PTEN-T366A consistently reduced Akt phosphorylation to a higher extent than unmutated PTEN (Fig. 5b). Thus, it appeared that phosphorylation of PTEN at Thr-366 by GSK3 reduces its biological activity. Although our data agreed with the conclusion from previous studies that CK2 plays a role in PTEN phosphorylation (17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), we found that CK2 is not the only kinase involved in this important task. Like several other groups (16Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 17Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 21Miller S.J. Lou D.Y. Seldin D.C. Lane W.S. Neel B.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we found that Ser-370 and Ser-385 indeed are phosphorylated in vivo and by CK2 in vitro. However, we saw little phosphorylation of other residues by CK2, and notably, no phosphorylation of threonine residues at all. We also found that CK2α and α′ are not required in intact cells for phosphorylation of Ser-380, although overall phosphorylation of PTEN was decreased by CK2 knock-down by RNA interference (data not shown). Thus, CK2 could not be the only kinase involved in PTEN phosphorylation in cells. Indeed, we found that GSK3β also phosphorylates PTEN at two sites, Ser-362 and Thr-366, the latter detected by Miller et al. (21Miller S.J. Lou D.Y. Seldin D.C. Lane W.S. Neel B.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as a site in intact cells. We also detected phosphate at Thr-366 in vivo, and this phosphate decreased upon knock-down of GSK3 or the addition of insulin-like growth factor 1 to the cells. Importantly, GSK3β and CK2 phosphorylated non-overlapping sites, and we found that phosphorylation of Ser-370 by CK2 strongly enhances subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-366 by GSK3β. Thus, these two kinases presumably synergized and could potentially cause rapid changes in the phosphorylation state of PTEN in cells. It also appeared that CK1 can phosphorylate PTEN, particularly at Ser-385, suggesting that this kinase may also play a role in intact cells. Fig. 4b shows a schematic view of the kinases involved in PTEN tail phosphorylation. We previously reported that PTEN phosphorylation is influenced by D3 phosphorylated inositol lipids (the substrates for PTEN) in what appears to be a negative feedback loop (20Birle D. Bottini N. Williams S. Huynh H. deBelle I. Adamson E. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A dilemma in this model was that CK2 is not known to be regulated by these phospholipids directly or indirectly. The introduction of GSK3β solves this dilemma (Fig. 5c). This kinase is known to be inhibited by phosphorylation by Akt, suggesting that high levels of D3-phosphoinositides (e.g. in Jurkat T cells) may reduce the phosphorylation at Thr-366 (and perhaps Ser-362). Indeed, catalytically inactive PTEN-C124G expressed in Jurkat T cells was highly phosphorylated on serine but contained nearly undetectable phosphothreonine (20Birle D. Bottini N. Williams S. Huynh H. deBelle I. Adamson E. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Okumura et al. (28Okumura K. Zhao M. Depinho R.A. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2703-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) recently showed that the C terminus of PTEN physically interacts with the oncogenic MSP58 protein. This interaction involved Thr-366 of PTEN and was abrogated by a T366A mutation, suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr-366 was necessary for the interaction. By interacting with MSP58, PTEN suppressed MSP58-driven cellular transformation in a manner that did not require the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN (28Okumura K. Zhao M. Depinho R.A. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2703-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since we found that GSK3 is responsible for phosphorylation of PTEN at Thr-366, it appeared that GSK3 plays an unexpected role in promoting the tumor suppressor function of PTEN by inducing binding of MSP58. At present, it remains unclear which kinase phosphorylates Ser-380. Neither CK2 nor GSK3β phosphorylated this site in vitro, and reactivity with the phospho-Ser-380 antibody was not affected by knock-down of either kinase. Thus, it appeared that a third kinase is responsible for PTEN phosphorylation at Ser-380. A possibility is CK1, which phosphorylated PTEN in vitro, in contrast to a number of other Ser/Thr kinases, including Akt, PDK1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Another possibility is a group of Ser/Thr kinases known as the MAST kinases, which contain a PDZ domain and bind to the C-terminal tail of PTEN (29Valiente M. Andrés-Pns A. Gomar B. Torres J. Gil A. Tapparel C. Antonarakis S.E. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28936-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Finally, it should be pointed out that PTEN is also regulated both transcriptionally and translationally, and both these mechanisms can contribute to rapid changes in PTEN protein levels and to dysregulation of PTEN in cancer. Understanding how PTEN is regulated should provide new insight into cell signaling mechanisms and may suggest novel approaches to the treatment of PTEN-deficient tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2030504358,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) carries the most dismal prognosis of all solid tumours. Both the late clinical presentation of patients, due to lack of early symptoms, as well as the rapid and aggressive course of the disease contribute to the extremely high mortality of this malignancy. Recently, a multistep progression model for PDAC integrating morphological, clinical and molecular evidence has been proposed. Putative precursor lesions, termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), are classified into three different grades (PanIN-1 through -3) based on the degree of cellular atypia they display. We have conducted large-scale expression profiling analyses of microdissected cells from normal pancreatic ducts, PanINs of different grades and PDACs using whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays. Verification of hybridisation results for selected genes was performed using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses on PanIN tissue microarrays. Comparison of the expression profiles demonstrated that the greatest changes in gene expression occur between PanIN stages 1B and 2, suggesting that PanIN-2 may represent the first truly preneoplastic stage in PDAC progression. Our results identify a large number of potential target genes for the development of novel molecular diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the prevention and early diagnosis of PDAC and provide novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in tumour progression in the pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W2148526752,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that populations consuming large amounts of soy protein have a reduced incidence of coronary heart disease (1-5). The cardiovascular risks associated with conventional hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women (5-7) have precipitated a search for alternative estrogen receptor modulators. Here we report that long-term feeding of rats with a soy protein-rich (SP) diet during gestation and adult life results in decreased oxidative stress, improved endothelial function, and reduced blood pressure in vivo measured by radiotelemetry in aged male offspring. Improved vascular reactivity in animals fed an SP diet was paralleled by increased mitochondrial glutathione and mRNA levels for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the antioxidant enzymes manganese superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c oxidase. Reduced eNOS and antioxidant gene expression, impaired endothelial function, and elevated blood pressure in animals fed a soy-deficient diet was reversed after refeeding them an SP diet for 6 months. Our findings suggest that an SP diet increases eNOS and antioxidant gene expression in the vasculature and other tissues, resulting in reduced oxidative stress and increased NO bioavailability. The improvement in endothelial function, increased gene expression, and reduced blood pressure by soy isoflavones have implications for alternative therapy for postmenopausal women and patients at risk of coronary heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W1997693725,"Surface binding of galectin family members has the potential to link distinct glycan structures to growth regulation. Therefore, we addressed the antiproliferative potential of galectin-1 (Gal-1) in a panel of carcinoma cell lines. We discovered growth inhibition by Gal-1 in epithelial tumor cell lines from different origins and provide evidence that this effect requires functional interaction with the α5β1 integrin. Antiproliferative effects result from inhibition of the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway and consecutive transcriptional induction of p27. We have further identified two Sp1-binding sites in the p27 promoter as crucial for Gal-1 responsiveness. Inhibition of the Ras-MEK-ERK cascade by Gal-1 increased Sp1 transactivation and DNA binding due to reduced threonine phosphorylation of Sp1. Furthermore, Gal-1 induced p21 transcription and selectively increased p27 protein stability. Gal-1-mediated accumulation of p27 and p21 inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity and ultimately resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition. These data define a novel mechanism whereby Gal-1 regulates epithelial tumor cell homeostasis via carbohydrate-dependent interaction with the α5β1 integrin. Surface binding of galectin family members has the potential to link distinct glycan structures to growth regulation. Therefore, we addressed the antiproliferative potential of galectin-1 (Gal-1) in a panel of carcinoma cell lines. We discovered growth inhibition by Gal-1 in epithelial tumor cell lines from different origins and provide evidence that this effect requires functional interaction with the α5β1 integrin. Antiproliferative effects result from inhibition of the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway and consecutive transcriptional induction of p27. We have further identified two Sp1-binding sites in the p27 promoter as crucial for Gal-1 responsiveness. Inhibition of the Ras-MEK-ERK cascade by Gal-1 increased Sp1 transactivation and DNA binding due to reduced threonine phosphorylation of Sp1. Furthermore, Gal-1 induced p21 transcription and selectively increased p27 protein stability. Gal-1-mediated accumulation of p27 and p21 inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity and ultimately resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition. These data define a novel mechanism whereby Gal-1 regulates epithelial tumor cell homeostasis via carbohydrate-dependent interaction with the α5β1 integrin.

It interacts with carbohydrate moieties of extracellular matrix components, membrane glycoproteins, and lipids such as laminin, fibronectin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and ganglioside GM1 (4André S.

Lipid Res.41, 145-155). Despite the abundance of β-galactosides in cellular glycoconjugates, Gal-1 binding is restricted to a limited and specific set of interaction partners, likely because of an extended binding site that accommodates more than the central galactose (6Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14762-14773Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As Gal-1 is a homodimer in solution, it is suited for cross-linking and capable of forming lattice-like structures with distinct glycans, a process assumed essential for signaling after clustering of cell surface glycoprotein receptors (8Brewer C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).Studies on activated T-cells have set a precedent that Gal-1 can serve as growth regulator via induction of apoptosis (9Yang R.Y. Liu F.-T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Its widespread differential expression in malignant cells and their non-transformed counterparts raises the possibility that Gal-1 also functions as a modulator of proliferation in other cell types, such as epithelial cells. Indeed, growth inhibition of tumor cells by Gal-1 has been reported (10Adams L. Scott G.K. Weinberg C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11van den Brûle F.A. Califice S. Garnier F. Fernandez P.L. Berchuck A. Castronovo V. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Of note, these growth effects were unaffected by the presence of a glycan inhibitor (9Yang R.Y. Liu F.-T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) or not specified with respect to glycan inhibitors (11van den Brûle F.A. Califice S. Garnier F. Fernandez P.L. Berchuck A. Castronovo V. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas the proapoptotic action of galectins on activated T-cells clearly depended on β-galactoside-specific binding (12Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar).Galectins have been suggested to exert their biological effects in part through interaction with integrins (5Hughes R.C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 13Moiseeva E.P. Williams B. Goodall A.H. Samani N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), although this interaction is still poorly understood in the case of Gal-1. Integrins provide adhesion to the appropriate extracellular matrix, a central requirement for the proliferation of epithelial cells (14Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 15Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). As heterodimeric transmembrane receptors, integrins recognize and bind extracellular matrix ligands and thereby control the organization of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton (16Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 17Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). In addition to their adhesive function, integrins also initiate and modulate signal transduction cascades. Both ligand occupancy and integrin clustering are critical for the activation of integrins and trigger intracellular signaling cascades (17Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Typically, integrins connect to intracellular signaling networks through recruitment, assembly, and activation of other signaling proteins in a bidirectional manner. Thus, integrin signaling converges with other signaling pathways to control central cellular processes. This cooperative signaling from integrins and other environmental cues such as soluble growth factors and cytokines is mandatory for orderly cell cycle progression (18Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 19Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and involves multiple mechanisms, among them induction of cyclins D and A as well as sequestration and down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) p21 and p27 (18Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Integrins control these events in part via modulation of growth-regulatory signaling pathways such as the canonical Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade (20Giancotti F.G. Tarone G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 173-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Based on (i) the ability of Gal-1 to regulate growth in activated T-cells and (ii) its carbohydrate-specific interaction with cell surface receptors, we explored the ability of Gal-1 to inhibit cell growth in epithelial tumor cell lines of different origin and delineated the underlying signal transduction events in unprecedented detail.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe following reagents were purchased: RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Invitrogen; fetal calf serum, trypsin/EDTA, penicillin, and streptomycin from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany); polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and Renaissance chemiluminescence detection reagent from PerkinElmer Life Sciences); [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham Biosciences; Raf-1 Raf-binding domain-agarose from Upstate Biotechnologies (Hamburg, Germany); effectene transfection reagent from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany); and fibronectin from EMP Genetech (Denzlingen, Germany).

For experiments on synchronized cultures, cells were serum starved for 36 h, which resulted in G0/G1 accumulation of ∼85-95% of the cells depending on the cell type, and were then stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by addition of fetal calf serum-supplemented medium.Purification and Labeling of Galectins—Galectins-1, -3, and -5 (human homodimeric prototype Gal-1, murine chimera-type galectin-3, and rat monomeric prototype galectin-5) were purified after recombinant production by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B to which lactose had been covalently attached via divinyl sulfone activation, and biotinylation was performed under activity-preserving conditions as described (4André S.

After an attachment period of 16 h, cells were incubated with galectins or vehicle as specified, and viable cells were counted using a hemocytometer.Stable Transfection of α5 Integrin and Separation of Cell Populations with High (α5) or Low (α5, α3, or αV) Integrin Surface Expression—α5 Full-length cDNA in the vector pRC-CMV (pRC-α5) was stably transfected using effectene transfection reagent according to the provided protocol. Subsequent selection of stably transfected cells was carried out with 0.8 mg/ml G418. To enrich the fraction of cells with high α5 surface expression in pRC-α5-transfected HT-29 populations, cells were selected using 5 × 108 Dynabeads M-450 (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) coated with an antibody to α5. Similarly, Dynabeads M-450 coated with antibodies to α5, α3, or αV were utilized to enrich BON cells with low α5 integrin expression. In this case, cells attached to the beads were removed from the cultures to obtain integrin-depleted fractions.Analysis of Integrin Expression by Flow Cytometry—Evaluation of integrin expression was conducted precisely as previously described (27Plath T.

The kinase reaction was started by addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate), 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample, and 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Rb fusion protein for Cdk4 or H1-histone for Cdk2 kinase assay, allowed to proceed for 30 min, and terminated by boiling the samples in Laemmli buffer. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and activities of Cdk2 and Cdk4 were determined by autoradiography of the dried gels.Ras Activation Assay—Cells were lysed in cold magnesium lysis buffer (10 mm MgCl2 with 1% Nonidet P-40).

Wang (Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC).Transactivation Assays—Transient transfections were performed using the effectene transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol; luciferase activity was analyzed as previously described (29von Marschall Z.

To correct for transfection efficiency, a Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK (Promega) was cotransfected. All experiments were performed in hexaplicates and repeated at least three times.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared using a non-ionic detergent method, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (29von Marschall Z.

In brief, equal amounts of nuclear extracts (5-10 μg) were incubated either with the radiolabeled oligonucleotides comprising the -555/-512 region (agcctcggcggggcggctcccgccgccgcaaccaatggatctcc) of the human p27 promoter or the CAGA boxes-containing oligonucleotide (tcgagagccagacaaaaagcc-agacatttagccagacac). For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with 100 × molar excess of the unlabeled -555/-512 and CAGA boxes-containing oligonucleotides or the following competitor oligonucleotides: Sp1 consensus, attcgatcggggcggggcgagc; Sp1 mutant, attcgatcggttcggggcgagc; -555/-512 oligonucleotides containing site mutations within the distal Sp1 site mSp-I, agcctcggcgggatggctcccgccgccgcaaccaatggatctcc, and the proximal Sp1-binding site mSp-II, agcctcggcggggcggctcctaccgccgcaaccaatggatctcc. For supershift experiments, extracts were preincubated for 30 min with 2 μg of antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 prior to the addition of radiolabeled probes.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed Student's t-test for paired observations or one-way analysis of variance using GraphPad statistical software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated.RESULTSGal-1 Inhibits Growth of Epithelial Tumor Cells in a Carbohydrate-dependent Manner—To study growth-regulatory effects of Gal-1 on transformed epithelial cells, a panel of human carcinoma cell lines was treated with Gal-1 and cell numbers were recorded. Of eight cell lines analyzed, none revealed an increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, six were growth inhibited, and two (Caco-2 and HT-29) showed no response (Fig. 1A). Significant growth inhibition started at 25 μg/ml Gal-1 and was consistently achieved at 50 or 100 μg/ml depending on the cell line investigated. Gal-1 reduced proliferation in a time-dependent manner, as documented by growth curves of HepG2 and BON cells (Fig. 1B).Coincubation of HepG2 cells with lactose, an inhibitor of carbohydrate-dependent Gal-1 binding, but not with sucrose (used as osmolarity control), abrogated the antiproliferative action of homodimeric Gal-1 (Fig. 1C), suggesting a carbohydrate-dependent mechanism. Because chimera-type galectin-3, which is mostly monomeric in solution (32Ahmad N. Gabius H.-J. André S. Kaltner H. Sabesan S. Roy R. Liu B. Macaluso F. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10841-10847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and monomeric prototype galectin-5 had no effects, Gal-1-effected cross-linking of glycans could be essential for growth inhibition (Fig. 1D).Expression of α5β1 Integrin Is Required for Gal-1-mediated Growth Inhibition—Exploring a potential involvement of integrins in Gal-1-mediated growth inhibition, we next characterized the expression of different integrins in Gal-1-responsive (HepG2, BON) and Gal-1-resistant (Caco-2, HT-29) cell lines by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). All cell lines expressed α1, α2, α3, α4, αV, and β1 integrins. Remarkably, α5 was expressed in HepG2 and BON cells but was not detectable in Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. This putative relationship between α5 expression and Gal-1 responsiveness was further supported by immunoblot analyses of α5 and β1 expression in eight cell lines (Fig. 2B). Again, all Gal-1-responsive cell lines expressed α5 integrin, whereas Gal-1 resistance correlated with lack of α5 expression in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells (see also Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Gal-1 functionally interacts with the α5β1 integrin.A, the integrin expression pattern was determined by flow cytometry using the indicated integrin-specific antibodies. B, whole cell lysates from tumor cell lines were analyzed by immunoblotting using specific monoclonal antibodies against α5 and β1. The lower band recognized by the β1-specific antibody likely represents pre-β1 integrin. C and D, HepG2 cells were treated with 125 μg/ml Gal-1 following 30 min of incubation with 150 μg/ml soluble fibronectin (panel C, FN) or an α5β1-blocking antibody (panel D, α5β1 Ab), and viable cells were determined after 72 h. Data represent mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each conducted in triplicate (***, p <0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on the hypothesis that Gal-1 might functionally interact with α5β1 integrin and thereby modify its signaling, we examined whether Gal-1-mediated growth inhibition could be prevented by preincubation with the α5β1 ligand fibronectin. Although fibronectin alone did not alter cell proliferation in HepG2 cells, it abrogated Gal-1-mediated inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 2C). Similarly, a neutralizing antibody to α5β1 integrin completely prevented cell growth inhibition by Gal-1 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, preincubation with either laminin or vitronectin or addition of neutralizing antibodies to α3β1 and αVβ1 integrins did not alter Gal-1-mediated growth inhibition (data not shown).To provide conclusive evidence for a functional role of α5β1 integrin in Gal-1-mediated growth inhibition, both α5-deficient colon cancer cell lines were stably transfected with a cDNA encoding the α5 integrin subunit. Expression of α5 integrin in the transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A) and flow cytometry (data not shown). We predicted emergence of strong reactivity to Gal-1. Indeed, α5-transfected HT-29 (HT-29α5) and Caco-2 (Caco-2α5) cells bound substantially increased amounts of biotinylated Gal-1 (Gal-1-bio), relative to mock-transfected controls (Fig. 3B). Because β1 integrin surface expression remained unchanged (Caco-2α5) or only slightly increased (HT-29α5) (data not shown), increased Gal-1 binding was unlikely to result from better access to the β1 subunit. In support of α5 integrin being a Gal-1 interaction partner, binding of labeled Gal-1 to HT-29α5 cells was substantially reduced when cells were preincubated with either fibronectin or a neutralizing antibody to α5β1 integrin (Fig. 3B). Functionally, Gal-1 treatment for 96 h resulted in significant growth inhibition in α5-transfected clones, whereas growth of mock-transfected controls was unaltered (Fig. 3C). Conversely, no Gal-1-mediated growth inhibition occurred in a subset of BON cells isolated from the parental population on the basis of low α5 integrin surface presentation, whereas Gal-1 expectedly reduced cell numbers in the parental cultures (Fig. 3D). In contrast, subpopulations selected based on low α3 or low αV integrin expression did not differ from parental cells with respect to Gal-1 responsiveness (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these experiments indicated that expression of cell surface α5β1 integrin was required for Gal-1-mediated growth inhibition.FIGURE 3Expression ofα5 sensitizes Caco-2 and HT-29 cells to Gal-1-mediated growth inhibition.A, analysis of α5 integrin expression in stably transfected Caco-2 and HT-29 cells as well as their respective mock controls by immunoblotting using whole cell lysates and a monoclonal antibody against α5. B, HT-29α5/1 and Caco-2α5/1 cells and respective mock controls were incubated with 125 μg/ml biotinylated Gal-1 (Gal-1-bio) for 10 min. HT-29α5/1 cells were also incubated in the presence of 125 μg/ml fibronectin (FN) or α5β1-specific antibody (α5β1Ab). After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove free labeled galectin, surface-bound biotinylated Gal-1 was determined by flow cytometry using a streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. Representative histograms are shown. C, stably α5-transfected HT-29 and Caco-2 cells and respective mock controls were treated with 100 and 200 μg/ml Gal-1 for 96 h, and the number of viable cells was determined. Data represent mean ± S.E. of three to four experiments, each conducted in triplicate (***, p <0.001). D, a BON cell subpopulation with low α5 surface expression was isolated based on the inability of the cells to attach to magnetic beads coated with an antibody to the α5 integrin subunit (α5-depleted). Reduced α5 expression (left panel) and conserved β1 expression (right panel) of this subpopulation in comparison to unselected control cultures was confirmed by flow cytometry. Cells were then subjected to Gal-1 treatment for 96 h, and the number of viable cells was determined (lower panel). As a control, populations with reduced α3 or αV integrin expression were similarly selected and subjected to 96 h of Gal-1 treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gal-1 Delays G1 Cell Cycle Progression—To gain insight into the mechanism of Gal-1-mediated growth inhibitio"
https://openalex.org/W2036996222,"We report a structural and functional analysis of the λ prophage Ba02 endolysin (PlyL) encoded by the <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> genome. We show that PlyL comprises two autonomously folded domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal cell wall-binding domain. We determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain; its three-dimensional fold is related to that of the cell wall amidase, T7 lysozyme, and contains a conserved zinc coordination site and other components of the catalytic machinery. We demonstrate that PlyL is an <i>N</i>-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase that cleaves the cell wall of several <i>Bacillus</i> species when applied exogenously. We show, unexpectedly, that the catalytic domain of PlyL cleaves more efficiently than the full-length protein, except in the case of <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, and using GFP-tagged cell wall-binding domain, we detected strong binding of the cell wall-binding domain to <i>B. cereus</i> but not to other species tested. We further show that a related endolysin (Ply21) from the <i>B. cereus</i> phage, TP21, shows a similar pattern of behavior. To explain these data, and the species specificity of PlyL, we propose that the C-terminal domain inhibits the activity of the catalytic domain through intramolecular interactions that are relieved upon binding of the C-terminal domain to the cell wall. Furthermore, our data show that (when applied exogenously) targeting of the enzyme to the cell wall is not a prerequisite of its lytic activity, which is inherently high. These results may have broad implications for the design of endolysins as therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1970596089,"Regulating the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors is of critical importance to animals, with consequences of misregulation that include cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases and developmental defects1. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have proved fruitful in determining the signals used to control NF-κB proteins, beginning with the discovery that the Toll/NF-κB pathway, in addition to patterning the dorsal–ventral axis of the fly embryo, defines a major component of the innate immune response in both Drosophila and mammals2,3. Here, we characterize the Drosophila wntD (Wnt inhibitor of Dorsal) gene. We show that WntD acts as a feedback inhibitor of the NF-κB homologue Dorsal during both embryonic patterning and the innate immune response to infection. wntD expression is under the control of Toll/Dorsal signalling, and increased levels of WntD block Dorsal nuclear accumulation, even in the absence of the IκB homologue Cactus. The WntD signal is independent of the common Wnt signalling component Armadillo (β-catenin). By engineering a gene knockout, we show that wntD loss-of-function mutants have immune defects and exhibit increased levels of Toll/Dorsal signalling. Furthermore, the wntD mutant phenotype is suppressed by loss of zygotic dorsal. These results describe the first secreted feedback antagonist of Toll signalling, and demonstrate a novel Wnt activity in the fly."
https://openalex.org/W1980769878,"Type 2 hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) or juvenile hemochromatosis is an early onset, genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload. Type 2A HH is caused by mutations in the recently cloned hemojuvelin gene (HJV; also called HFE2) (Papanikolaou, G., Samuels, M. E., Ludwig, E. H., MacDonald, M. L., Franchini, P. L., Dube, M.

In this study, we stably transfected HJV cDNA into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and characterized the processing of HJV and its effect on iron homeostasis. Our results indicate that HJV is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein and undergoes a partial autocatalytic cleavage during its intracellular processing. HJV co-immunoprecipitated with neogenin, a receptor involved in a variety of cellular signaling processes. It did not interact with the closely related receptor DCC (deleted in Colon Cancer).

Type 2 HH or juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) is a rare autosomal recessive disease with high penetrance that affects young patients of both sexes and that leads to severe clinical complications typically in the first and second decades of life (4De Gobbi M.

JH results from mutations of either the HJV gene (Type 2A) or the hepcidin gene (Type 2B) in early iron loading with similar serum iron parameters and distribution of accumulated iron in organs (2Pietrangelo A.

Both Type 1 HH and JH individuals have increased intestinal absorption and deposition of iron in vital organs, including the liver, heart, and pancreas. However, JH individuals have a higher rate of iron absorption and a more rapid and severe clinical course with a higher frequency of cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and hypogonadism (5Camaschella C.

HJV has five predicted spliced transcripts encoding three different proteins of 426, 313, and 200 amino acids. Northern blot analysis has indicated high expression in adult and fetal liver, heart, and skeletal muscle with the full-length mRNA as the primary transcript. The encoded protein (HJV) possesses multiple protein domains, including an N-terminal signal peptide, an RGD motif, a partial von Willebrand factor D motif, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (6Papanikolaou G.

Genet. 2004; 36: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), the sporadic distribution of these mutations hints that Type 2A HH is due to the loss of HJV function. Interestingly, the hepcidin levels in these patients are found to be consistently depressed, suggesting that HJV may act as a modulator of hepcidin expression (6Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L. MacFarlane J. Sakellaropoulos N. Politou M. Nemeth E. Thompson J. Risler J.K. Zaborowska C. Babakaiff R. Radomski C.C. Pape T.D.

Hepcidin is a small peptide hormone synthesized predominantly in hepatocytes. It is critical for the maintenance of body iron homeostasis through down-regulation of the iron exporter FPN in intestinal endothelial cells and macrophages (17Krause A. Neitz S. Magert H.J.

Danan J.L. Bigard X. Devaux I. Beaumont C. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). In contrast, a more recent study found that HJV mRNA levels are increased by inflammation, but do not respond to iron status or erythropoietin in mice (21Krijt J. Vokurka M. Chang K.T. Necas E. Blood. 2004; 104: 4308-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HJV shares considerable sequence similarity with the newly identified repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs) (6Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L. MacFarlane J. Sakellaropoulos N. Politou M. Nemeth E. Thompson J. Risler J.K. Zaborowska C. Babakaiff R. Radomski C.C.

In the mouse (m) RGM family, there are at least three members, mRGMa, mRGMb, and mRGMc (22Schmidtmer J. Engelkamp D. Gene Expr.

Human HJV is the ortholog of mRGMc (Fig. 1). In situ hybridization analysis of the distribution of the various RGMs in mouse embryos has shown that mRGMa and mRGMb are expressed predominantly in distinct, mostly no-overlapping patterns in the developing and adult central nervous systems, whereas mRGMc is expressed mainly in skeletal and heart muscles (22Schmidtmer J.

The in situ localization of mRGMc is consistent with the Northern blot analysis results of HJV mRNA in human tissues and the fact that no neural symptoms have been reported in Type 2A HH patients (6Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L. MacFarlane J. Sakellaropoulos N. Politou M. Nemeth E. Thompson J. Risler J.K. Zaborowska C. Babakaiff R. Radomski C.C.

Functional studies of mRGMa in mouse embryos have revealed that it plays a critical role in the control of cephalic neural tube closure and formation of afferent connections in the dentate gyrus (24Niederkofler V. Salie R. Sigrist M. Arber S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Brinks H. Conrad S. Vogt J. Oldekamp J. Sierra A. Deitinghoff L. Bechmann I.

Flad M. Hornberger M.R. Stahl B. Bonhoeffer F. Mueller B.K. Nature. 2002; 419: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated that neogenin is the high affinity receptor for chicken and mouse RGMs and that their interaction is critical in the regulation of neuronal survival (27Rajagopalan S.

It is closely related to another receptor, DCC (deleted in Colon Cancer), with nearly 50% amino acid identity. Neogenin is widely expressed in different tissues, including muscles and liver (29Vielmetter J. Kayyem J.F. Roman J.M. Dreyer W.J. J.

Functional studies in zebrafish embryos using morpholino oligonucleotides demonstrated that it is essential for neural tube formation and somitogenesis (32Mawdsley D.J. Cooper H.M. Hogan B.M. Cody S.H. Lieschke G.J. Heath J.K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a function similar to mRGMa in mouse embryos (24Niederkofler V. Salie R. Sigrist M. Arber S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This evidence supports the idea that the RGMa/neogenin interaction is indispensable for neural development. On the basis of the high sequence identity of RGMa to RGMc and human HJV, the lack of RGMa in the liver, and finally the presence of HJV and neogenin in the liver (6Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we speculate that neogenin might also be a candidate receptor for HJV. In this study, we stably transfected HJV cDNA into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and characterized its effect on iron homeostasis. Our results indicate that HJV is processed similarly to other members of the RGM family of proteins. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that HJV interacts with neogenin, but not with DCC, and that the HJV G320V mutant implicated in Type 2A HH does not bind to neogenin. Immunoblot analysis of ferritin levels and transferrin (Tf)-bound 55Fe accumulation studies showed that the HJV-induced increases in intracellular iron levels in HEK293 cells are dependent on the presence of neogenin in the cells. Subcloning HJV into pcDNA3—The full-length HJV open reading frame was amplified from a human liver cDNA library by PCR using the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with primers 5′-atgggggagccaggccagtcccctagtcccaggtcctccc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttactgaatgcaaagccacagaacaaagagcccagaaagga-3′ (reverse). The amplicon was subsequently cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). After the sequence was confirmed by sequencing, the HJV open reading frame was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to make the pcDNA3-HJV construct. To map the fragmentation pattern of HJV, we engineered a modified plasmid by addition of a Myc tag at the position 3 amino acid after the N-terminal signal peptide sequence. To do this, two portions of the HJV open reading frame (the first 111 bp at the 5′-end and the remaining 1170 bp at the 3′-end) were first amplified separately using the primers for the full-length HJV open reading frame cloning (described above) as well as the following primers: 5′-ctcgaggcattgagaatgagcatgtcc-3′ (reverse primer for the former) and 5′-ctcgaggagcagaaactcatctctgaagaggatctgaagatcctccgctgcaatgct-3′ (forward primer for the latter). An XhoI enzyme digestion site was also included in these primers to ligate the two HJV fragments. The PCR amplicons were first cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and their sequences and orientation in the vectors were verified. The 1170-bp 3′-portion of HJV was excised from pGEM-T with XhoI and SphI and subcloned into pGEM-T containing the 111-bp 5′-portion of HJV. The resulting MycHJV in pGEM-T (pGEM-T-Myc-HJV) was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 as follows. Both the pGEM-T-Myc-HJV and pcDNA3 vectors were first linearized by SphI and ApaI digestion, respectively, followed by treatment with the Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs Inc.) to make blunt ends. Myc-HJV was then excised from linearized pGEM-T-Myc-HJV with NotI and ligated with linearized and NotI-digested pcDNA3 to form pcDNA3-Myc-HJV. The construct was verified by sequencing. The HJV G320V mutant was made using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The pcDNA3-HJV construct was used as a template. The primers used to introduce the mutation were 5′-gctctgtgttggggtgtgccctccaagtc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gacttggagggcacaccccaacacagagc-3′ (reverse). The G320V mutation in the resulting construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. No other sequence changes were detected. The full-length human neogenin cDNA in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Eric R. Fearon (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). The sequence has been published previously (30Meyerhardt J.A. Look A.T. Bigner S.H. Fearon E.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm pyruvate. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Transiently transfected cells were used in experiments ∼48 h post-transfection. For stable transfection, transfected cells were selected under 800 μg/ml G418. Positive clones were screened by Western blot analysis. HEK293 cells stably transfected with Myc-HJV, HJV G320V, and empty vector (pcDNA3) were designated Myc-HJV HEK293 cells, HJV G320V HEK293 cells, and control HEK293 cells, respectively. HT29 cells stably transfected either with DCC (HT29-DCC11) or with empty vector (HT29-neo) (33Velcich A. Corner G. Palumbo L. Augenlicht L.

Generation of Soluble HJV (sHJV) and Anti-HJV Antibody—A construct encoding a soluble portion of HJV (residues 1–401 inclusive of the HJV signal sequence) with a C-terminal His tag was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen). sHJV was purified from the supernatants of baculovirus-infected High5 cells and buffer-exchanged to 10 mm Tris (pH 8) and 200 mm NaCl, followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow chromatography (Qiagen Inc.). Protein from an imidazole elution was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in 20 mm Tris (pH 8) and 300 mm NaCl at 4 °C (34Lebron J.A. Bennett M.J. Vaughn D.E. Chirino A.J. Snow P.M. Mintier G.A. Feder J.N. Bjorkman P.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 111-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). sHJV was used as an antigen to generate polyclonal antiserum in rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory, Inc., Canadensis, PA). Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—Two days prior to immunofluorescence analysis, Myc-HJV HEK293, HJV G320V HEK293 and control HEK293 cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were either blocked directly in 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature (non-permeabilized cells) or treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by blocking (permeabilized cells). The cells were then incubated either with affinity-purified anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (for Myc-HJV; a kind gift from Dr. Jan Christian, Oregon Health & Science University) at 1:20 dilution or with rabbit anti-HJV serum (for HJV G320V) at 1:400 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with either Alexa 594-labeled donkey anti-mouse (1:500 dilution) or goat anti-rabbit (1:500 dilution) antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as the corresponding secondary antibody. Cells were mounted with ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and imaged using a Nikon fluorescence microscope (×60 oil immersion lens; Meridian Instrument Company, Inc., Kent, WA). Immunodetection on Western Blots—Cell lysates from HEK293 and HT29 cells were prepared as described previously (35Carlson H. Zhang A.S. Fleming W.H. Enns C.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 2564-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were subjected to 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions as indicated below. After transferring onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocking with 5% nonfat milk in buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4), and 0.05% Tween 20, immunoblot analysis was performed using mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution), rabbit anti-HJV peptide antibody (1:1000 dilution; a kind gift from Dr. Silvia Arber, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland) (24Niederkofler V. Salie R. Sigrist M. Arber S. J.

Blots were visualized by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). Equal protein loading in each lane was verified by both Ponceau S staining and Western blotting for β-actin. Neutralization of pH in the HJV-processing Compartments—MycHJV HEK293 cells (clones 6 and 15) and control HEK293 cells were incubated overnight in the presence or absence of 25 mm NH4Cl. Cell lysates were prepared as described above and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. HJV was detected using anti-HJV peptide antibody at 1:1000 dilution. Phosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Cleavage of Cell-surface HJV—Approximately 5 × 105 intact HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HJV or empty vector were suspended in 0.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the presence or absence of PI-PLC (ProZyme, San Leandro, CA) at a concentration of 1 unit/ml for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Both cell lysates and supernatants were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunodetection of HJV using rabbit anti-HJV antibody at 1:10,000 dilution as described under “Immunodetection on Western Blots.” Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (36Gross C.N.

Briefly, 50 μlof Pansorbin (Calbiochem) was first coated with antibody by incubation with 2 μl of either rabbit anti-HJV serum or 2 μg of rabbit anti-neogenin antibody in 50 μl of NET/Triton buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100) for 50 min at 4 °C. After removing the unbound antibody by washing with NET/Triton buffer, pre-absorbed cell lysate as indicated below was added and incubated at 4 °C for 50 min, followed by washing twice with NET/Triton buffer. Samples were eluted in 100 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Immunodetection was performed as described above, except that rabbit TrueBlot (catalog no. 18-8816, eBioscience) at 1:1000 dilution was used as the secondary antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2137063799,"It is widely accepted that stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport, the efflux of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transferring it to the liver for biliary excretion, is becoming an important component in reducing excess cholesterol deposition in atherosclerotic plaques. The ATP-binding cassette transporter has been identified as a key regulator of macrophage cholesterol efflux and apoAI-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. In vivo studies have documented anthocyanins, a large group of naturally phenolic compounds rich in plants, possess substantial capacities in improving plasma cholesterol levels. In this study, we investigated the potential role of anthocyanins in modulating cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells and the possible molecular mechanism linking ABCA1 to cholesterol efflux. Incubation of the mouse peritoneal macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells with cyanidin-3-O-beta-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-beta-glucoside led to dose-dependent (1-100 microM) induction in cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 mRNA expression, and this effect could be blocked by the ABCA1 inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, disodium salt, and a general inhibitor of gene transcription actinomycin D. Treatment of the macrophages with anthocyanins also activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, liver X receptor alpha mRNA expression, and their mediated gene expression. Addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt or GW9662 markedly inhibited the anthocyanin-induced increase of ABCA1 gene expression and apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. These data demonstrated that anthocyanin induces cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells and that stimulation of cholesterol efflux by anthocyanin is mediated, at least in part, by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-liver X receptor alpha-ABCA1 signaling pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2095267300,"The E6 proteins of the high-risk Human papillomaviruses (HPV) types have a well-documented ability to target certain cellular proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the proteasome. Previous studies have shown that E6 proteins interact differently with different target proteins, and that the viral proteins, depending upon the target, may recruit diverse cellular ubiquitin-protein ligases. In this study, we have examined the abilities of E6 proteins from HPV-16 and HPV-18 to interact with and induce the degradation of two PDZ domain-containing targets, Dlg and hScrib. We have also mapped the binding site of E6 on hScrib and shown that the interaction of E6 with hScrib is distinct from its interactions with other PDZ domain-containing targets. This is reflected in the efficiency with which the two viral E6 proteins can inhibit hScrib's suppression of cell transformation.Dlg and hScrib have complementary activities in the control of epithelial cell polarity and the fact that both are targeted by high-risk HPV E6 proteins underlines their importance. Our finding that they are each targeted differently by HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6s suggests that the two viruses are subjected to somewhat different constraints and provides a possible explanation for the apparent redundancy in targeting both parts of this important control mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2033222419,"Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Eph family are upregulated in several different types of cancer. One family member in particular, the EphA2 receptor, has been linked to breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer, as well as melanoma. However, mechanisms by which EphA2 contributes to tumor progression are far from clear. In certain tumor cell lines, EphA2 receptor is underphosphorylated, raising the question of whether ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and its kinase activity play a role in oncogenesis. To test directly the role of EphA2 receptor phosphorylation/kinase activity in tumor progression, we generated EphA2 receptor variants that were either lacking the cytoplasmic domain or carrying a point mutation that inhibits its kinase activity. Expression of these EphA2 mutants in breast cancer cells resulted in decreased tumor volume and increased tumor apoptosis in primary tumors. In addition, the numbers of lung metastases were significantly reduced in both experimental and spontaneous metastasis models. Reduced tumor volume and metastasis are not due to defects in tumor angiogenesis, as there is no significant difference in tumor vessel density between wild-type tumors and tumors expressing EphA2-signaling-defective mutants. In contrast, tumor cells expressing the EphA2 mutants are defective in RhoA GTPase activation and cell migration. Taken together, these results suggest that receptor phosphorylation and kinase activity of the EphA2 receptor, at least in part, contribute to tumor malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2023587649,"Neuroblastoma is a common childhood tumor comprising cases with rapid disease progression as well as spontaneous regression. Although numerous prognostic factors have been identified, risk evaluation in individual patients remains difficult. To define a reliable prognostic predictor and gene signatures characteristic of biological subgroups, we performed mRNA expression profiling of 68 neuroblastomas of all stages. Expression data were analysed using support vector machines (SVM-rbf), prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms and multiple decision trees. SVM-rbf performed best of all methods, and predicted recurrence of neuroblastoma with an accuracy of 85% (sensitivity 77%, specificity 94%). PAM identified a classifier of 39 genes reliably predicting outcome with an accuracy of 80%. In comparison, conventional risk stratification based on stage, age and MYCN-status only reached a predictive accuracy of 64%. Kaplan–Meier analysis using the PAM classifier indicated a 5-year survival of 20 versus 78% for patients with unfavorably versus favorably predicted neuroblastomas, respectively (P=0.0001). Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) identified additional genes differentially expressed among subgroups. MYCN-amplification and high expression of NTRK1/TrkA demonstrated a strong association with specific gene expression patterns. Our data suggest that microarray-derived data in addition to traditional clinical factors will be useful for risk assessment and defining biological properties of neuroblastoma."

A., Nagai, H., and Hakomori, S. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 6414–6421; Kawakami, Y., Kawakami, K., Steelant, W. F. A., Ono, M., Baek, R. C., Handa, K., Withers, D. A., and Hakomori, S. (2002) J. Biol.

Human bladder cancer cell lines KK47 (noninvasive and nonmetastatic) and YTS1 (highly invasive and metastatic), both derived from transitional bladder epithelia, are very similar in terms of integrin composition and levels of tetraspanin CD9. Tetraspanin CD82 is absent in both. The major difference is in the level of ganglioside GM3, which is several times higher in KK47 than in YTS1. We now report that the GM3 level reflects glycosynapse function as follows: (i) a stronger interaction of integrin α3 with CD9 in KK47 than in YTS1; (ii) conversion of benign, low motility KK47 to invasive, high motility cells by depletion of GM3 by P4 (d-threo-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol) treatment or by knockdown of CD9 by the RNA interference method; (iii) reversion of high motility YTS1 to low motility phenotype like that of KK47 by exogenous GM3 addition, whereby the α3-to-CD9 interaction was enhanced; (iv) low GM3 level activated c-Src in YTS1 or in P4-treated KK47, and high GM3 level by exogenous addition caused Csk translocation into glycosynapse, with subsequent inhibition of c-Src activation; (v) inhibition of c-Src by “PP2” in YTS1 greatly reduced cell motility. Thus, GM3 in glycosynapse 3 plays a dual role in defining glycosynapse 3 function. One is by modulating the interaction of α3 with CD9; the other is by activating or inhibiting the c-Src activity, possibly through Csk translocation. High GM3 level decreases tumor cell motility/invasiveness, whereas low GM3 level enhances tumor cell motility/invasiveness.

Such an interaction is likely based on the structure and function of the microdomain at the tumor cell surface interfacing with the normal cell microdomain and with extracellular matrix components, particularly at the basement membrane. A crucial event for the progression of many types of tumor cells of epithelial origin is their adhesion/motility/invasion on the basement membrane underlying epithelial cells. In this process, specific microdomains of tumor cells are considered to interact with laminin-5 (“epiligrin”) (2Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J.

Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to clarify contrasting composition of GM3, α3, and CD9 in glycosynapse 3 and their interaction and to define motility/invasive properties of two closely related human bladder cancer cell lines: KK47 with noninvasive, low motility phenotype, and YTS1 with invasive, high motility phenotype. Our results make clear the dual functional role of GM3 in glycosynapse 3 as follows: (i) high or low GM3 level promotes or inhibits the interaction of α3 with CD9 in order to stabilize or de-stabilize the α3-CD9-GM3 complex within the microdomain; (ii) high or low GM3 level activates or inhibits c-Src through association or dissociation with Csk within the same microdomain. Through either process, the GM3 level regulates tumor cell motility/invasiveness. Oncogenic conversion or phenotypic reversion from invasive to noninvasive cells is associated with change of the GM3 level, which mediates the functional alteration of the α3 interaction with CD9 and of the degree of c-Src activation with Csk interaction. The present study may help explain the mechanism by which glycosynapse organization and composition define oncogenic conversion or reversion to normal cell phenotypes, as suggested in previous studies of bladder cancer (7Satoh M.

Briefly, YTS1 and KK47 cells were grown until ∼90% confluence in 15-cm dishes and washed three times with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). ∼2×107 cells were collected and extracted twice with C/M (2:1). The extracts were dried under a N2 stream. To remove phospholipids, the dried residue was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 m NaOH in methanol and incubated at 40 °C for 2 h. After neutralization with 1 n HCl, fatty acids were extracted twice with 2 ml of hexane. GSLs in the lower phase were evaporated, dissolved in water, and applied to 3 ml of BondElut C18 columns (Varian, Harbor City, CA) to remove salt. Columns were washed with water, and GSLs were eluted with C/M (2:1).

Briefly, 24-well plates were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h at 37 °C, washed with 100% ethanol, and dried. Gold sol suspension (gold colloidal particles) was prepared by adding 11 ml of H2O and 6 ml of 36.5 mm Na2CO3 to 1.8 ml of 14.5 mm AuHCl4. The mixture was boiled, and 1.8 ml of freshly prepared 0.1% formaldehyde solution was added. Gold sol suspension was put in each well and incubated for 40 min at room temperature, and the plate was washed with culture medium. Cells in culture medium (1 × 104/well) were plated onto gold sol-coated wells and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Migratory cells were observed and photographed under light microscope (Nikon). Migratory areas of 20 cells of each well were measured by Scion image program and expressed as square pixels. Interaction between CD9 and integrins was analyzed by co-IP as described previously (6Kawakami Y. Kawakami K. Steelant W.F.A. Ono M. Baek R.C. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Briefly, YTS1 and KK47 cells were grown for 24 h on cover glass (12 mm diameter) placed in 24-well plates. Cells on cover glass were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, PBS for 30 min and incubated with mouse anti-CD9 IgG1 mAb for 1 h at room temperature. After washing and permeabilization with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, rabbit anti-α3 was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with a mixture of goat anti-mouse IgG1-labeled with Texas Red and goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with FITC for 1 h at room temperature, washed, mounted with a drop of Glycergel mounting medium (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and observed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Fluo-View™, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) using an appropriate filter set. YTS1 cells were grown in a 10-cm dish for 24 h, and growth medium was changed to serum-free medium. GM3 was dissolved in serum-free medium by sonication and standing for 24 h at room temperature, added to cells in serum-free medium at concentrations of 10, 20, and 50 μm, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. GM1 was exogenously added in the same way in a separate experiment. Cells were analyzed by co-IP and confocal microscopy for interaction between CD9 and α3 and by phagokinetic gold sol assay for cell motility. KK47 cells were grown in a 10-cm dish for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was changed to fresh growth medium with or without P4 (1 μm) and further incubated for 72 h. The cells were analyzed by co-IP and confocal microscopy for interaction between CD9 and α3 and by phagokinetic gold sol assay for cell motility. Ceramide in P4-treated cells was analyzed by HPTLC with C/M/water (65:25:4) and charring in 3% cupric acetate and 10% phosphoric acid for 20 min at 130 °C, on 400 μg of cellular protein basis, as described previously (31Rani C.S.

Transfection—These plasmids were co-transfected with pPUR vector (Clontech) into KK47 cells by electroporation. Two days after transfection, puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) was added for selection. After cloning, CD9 mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR, and CD9 expression was measured by flow cytometry and Western blot. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from transfectants by RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using TaqDNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction, with CD9 primers (sense, 5′-TTGGACTATGGCTCCGATTC-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCATGCACTGGGACTCCT-3′), yielding a 175-bp product, and with β-actin primers (sense, 5′-AACCGCGAGAAGATGACCCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACAT-3′), yielding a 721-bp product. Flow Cytometry—Cells were detached by trypsin/EDTA and washed with PBS. Aliquots of cells (1 × 105) were incubated with mouse anti-CD9 IgG1 for 1 h on ice, washed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse IgM + G-labeled with FITC for 40 min on ice, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and analyzed using a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). c-Src and its phosphorylation at Tyr-416 (for activation) and at Tyr-527 (for inhibition) were determined by Western blot analysis in KK47 versus YTS1 cells, using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. PNF, low density membrane fractions (fractions 4–6), and high density membrane fractions (fractions 10–12) separated through sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation were analyzed. Csk was determined simultaneously in these fractions. To test the GM3 effect on c-Src activity, KK47 cells were pretreated with P4 for 72 h (see “Effect of P4 on GM3 and Ceramide Levels, Interaction of CD9 with α3, and Cell Motility in KK47 Cells”), followed by Western blot analysis of c-Src, Tyr-416, Tyr-527, and Csk. The intensity of γ-tubulin in each fraction was used as loading control. YTS1 cells were incubated with 50 μm GM3 in serum-free medium for various durations (1, 3, and 16 h) (see “Effect of Exogenous GM3 on Interaction of CD9 with α3 and Cell Motility in YTS1 Cells”), followed by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to separate low density and high density fractions, and Western blot analysis of each fraction for determination of c-Src phosphorylation status and Csk translocation into low density fractions (GEM). YTS1 cells were seeded on a 15-cm dish and grown in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. PP2, an Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was added to the medium at 0, 5, 10, and 20 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were subjected to phagokinetic gold sol assay as described above. Composition of KK47 Versus YTS1 Microdomain—First, we compared the major components of glycosynapse 3 (integrins α3, α5, and β1; PLP/TSP CD9 and CD82; gangliosides) in total cell lysate prepared in RIPA buffer from KK47 and YTS1 as shown in Fig. 1, A–C. Levels of the integrins were essentially the same in the two cell lines (Fig. 1A). The CD9 level was similar, and CD82 was absent in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). The ganglioside expressed in YTS1 was mainly GM2, whereas that in KK47 was mainly GM3, as revealed by TLC with orcinol/sulfuric acid staining. GM3 level in KK47 was 4–5 times higher than in YTS1 (Fig. 1C). The amounts of α3 and CD9 in low density insoluble membrane fraction and high density soluble fraction, separated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation from PNF of cell lysate prepared with lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 98, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot (Fig. 1D, top). α3 was enriched in fractions 4–6, whereas CD9 was enriched in fractions 4 and 5. The degree of enrichment of both components was higher in YTS1 than in KK47. Neither α3 nor CD9 was detectable in fractions 1–3 or fractions 7–9 from YTS1 or KK47 (data not shown). Gangliosides were concentrated in fractions 4–6 from both cell lines (Fig. 1D, bottom). The GM3 concentration in combined low density fractions (fractions 4–6) from KK47 and YTS1 was ∼15 ng/30 μg of protein and <2 ng/30 μg of protein, respectively. GM2 concentration in the same fractions from YTS1 and KK47 was ∼12 ng/30 μg of protein and <2 ng/30 μg of protein, respectively. Neither GM3 nor GM2 was detectable in fractions 1–3 or fractions 7–9 from YTS1 or KK47 (data not shown). Interactions of Components in KK47 Versus YTS1 Microdomain—Interactions were determined by co-IP and by confocal microscopy. Co-IP of α3 with CD9 and of β1 with CD9 was performed by the addition of anti-α3 or anti-β1 antibody to PNF, followed by Western blot with anti-CD9, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Co-IP of α3 with CD9 was much higher in KK47 than in YTS1, whereas co-IP of β1 with CD9 was weak (and similar) in the two cell lines. α5 was not co-immunoprecipitated with CD9 from either cell line (Fig. 2A). Co-localization of α3 with CD9 was significantly higher in KK47 than in YTS1, as indicated by the enhanced merge image in confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B). Difference in Motility of KK47 Versus YTS1 by Phagokinetic Gold Sol Assay—Transwell membrane motility through thick Matrigel was much higher for YTS1 than for KK47 (7Satoh M. Ito A. Nojiri H.

https://openalex.org/W2119426268,"ABCG2 is an ATP binding cassette (ABC) half-transporter that plays a key role in multidrug resistance to chemotherapy. ABCG2 is believed to be a functional homodimer that has been proposed to be linked by disulfide bridges. We have investigated the structural and functional role of the only three cysteines predicted to be on the extracellular face of ABCG2. Upon mutation of Cys-592 or Cys-608 to alanine (C592A and C608A), ABCG2 migrated as a dimer in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions; however, mutation of Cys-603 to Ala (C603A) caused the transporter to migrate as a single monomeric band. Despite this change, C603A displayed efficient membrane targeting and preserved transport function. Because the transporter migrated as a dimer in SDS-PAGE, when only Cys-603 was present (C592A-C608A), the data suggest that Cys-603 forms a symmetrical intermolecular disulfide bridge in the ABCG2 homodimer that is not essential for protein expression and function. In contrast to C603A, both C592A and C608A displayed impaired membrane targeting and function. Moreover, when only Cys-592 or Cys-608 were present (C592A/C603A and C603A/C608A), the transporter displayed impaired plasma membrane expression and function. The combined mutation (C592A/C608A) partially restored plasma membrane expression; however, although transport of mitoxantrone was almost normal, we observed impairment of BODIPY-prazosin transport. This supports the conclusion that Cys-592 and Cys-608 form an intramolecular disulfide bridge in ABCG2 that is critical for substrate specificity. Finally, mutation of all three cysteines simultaneously resulted in low expression and no measurable function. Altogether, our data are consistent with a scenario in which an inter- and an intramolecular disulfide bridge together are of fundamental importance for the structural and functional integrity of ABCG2.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20645-20651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). ABCG2 is a half-transporter with an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Many ABC half-transporters function as homo- or heterodimers (18Liu L.X. Janvier K.

Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and it is widely accepted that ABCG2 exists as a homodimer (20Kage K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47980-47990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It has, however, also been proposed that ABCG2 exists in the cell as a homotetramer (23Xu J. Liu Y. Yang Y. Bates S. Zhang J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19781-19789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have supported that ABCG2 is indeed an oligomer (most likely a homodimer), and function of the transporter is dependent on this dimerization (24Henriksen U. Gether U. Litman T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, our previous data also shows that dimerization of the transporter is not dependent on functional nucleotide binding domains, as an inactivating mutation (K86M) in the Walker A motif did not alter the ability of ABCG2 to form dimers (24Henriksen U. Gether U. Litman T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hence, the molecular basis responsible for dimerization of ABCG2 remains to be clarified. It was recently proposed that a known dimerization motif, the GXXXG motif (25Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H.R. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), located in TM1 of ABCG2 is important for proper protein processing and function, but it was also found not to be the sole mechanism of dimerization (27Polgar O. Robey R.W. Morisaki K. Dean M. Michejda C. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Tarasova N. Bates S.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9448-9456Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we present evidence that ABCG2 most likely is a disulfide bridge-linked dimer (24Henriksen U. Gether U. Litman T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and this has also been proposed by others (20Kage K. Tsukahara S. Sugiyama T. Asada S. Ishikawa E. Tsuruo T. Sugimoto Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 21Litman T. Jensen U. Hansen A. Covitz K. Zhan Z. Fetsch P. Abati A. Hansen P. Horn T. Skovsgaard T. Bates S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). According to the predicted topology of ABCG2, a large 68-residue-long extracellular loop exists between TM5 and TM6 (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, there are three cysteine residues in this loop in close proximity to each other i.e. Cys-592, Cys-603, and Cys-608 (Fig. 1). In this study, we have carried out a systematic mutagenesis analysis of these cysteines to assess their role in the structure and covalent linking of the ABCG2 homodimer. Plasmids, Drugs, and Antibodies—pcDNA3.1(-)MXR (R482G) and fumitremorgin C (FTC) was kindly provided by Dr. Susan Bates, NCI, National Institutes of Health. BODIPY-prazosin was obtained from Molecular Probes. Biocytine-maleimide came from Invitrogen. TCEP, sodium-2-mercapto-ethanesulfonate, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The following antibodies were used: anti-ABCG2 (5D3, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), BXP-21 (Alexis Biochemicals, Montreal, Canada) and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Construction of Mutations—The ABCG2 cysteine mutations were generated by a two-generation PCR technique using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The generated PCR fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into pCIN4, a bicistronic mammalian expression vector that confers geneticin (G418) resistance (28Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing using an ABI 310 automated sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax I supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.01 mg/ml gentamycin (all products from Invitrogen). For stable transfections, 1 × 106 HEK293 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of the pCIN4 constructs using the Lipofectamine™/Opti-MEM™ (Invitrogen) transfection system. A stably transfected pool clone was selected using G418 (0.35 mg/ml) and maintained in 0.2 mg/ml G418. Total Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—Cells were grown to 90% confluence in 6-well plates and harvested in solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors) while kept on ice. After 30 min of incubation with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16000 × g for 30 min, and protein concentration was measured. Protein samples were added 2× SDS loading buffer (± 100 mm DTT, +10 mm NEM) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were applied onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated in blocking buffer (TST, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 + 5% dry milk (w/vol)). Primary antibody was 1:1000 BXP-21, and secondary antibody was 1:10000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody. The blots were developed using Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Cytotoxicity Assay—The cytotoxicity assay was performed as described by Skehan et al. (29Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar). Stably transfected HEK293 cells were seeded (2000 cells/well) in sterile 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Corning, Acton, MA) in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax and incubated 24 h at 37 °C. Mitoxantrone was added in 10 different final concentrations in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, the cells were fixed in 50% trichloroacetic acid. The fixed cells were stained with 100 μl of 0.4% sulforhodamine B (SRB) in 1% acetic acid. Finally, the SRB dye was dissolved in 10 mm unbuffered Tris base (pH 10.5) for 10 min and measured at A562 in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Efflux Assay—The efflux assay was performed as described by Lee et al. 1994 (30Lee J.S. Paull K. Alvarez M. Hose C. Monks A. Grever M. Fojo A.T. Bates S.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 627-638PubMed Google Scholar). One 175-cm2 flask of stably transfected HEK293 cells were harvested, resuspended in 10 ml of improved modified Eagle's medium, and washed once. During the accumulation period, 3 aliquots of cells were suspended in 100 μl of improved modified Eagle's medium, containing solvent (i), BODIPY-prazosin (100 nm) (ii), or BODIPY-prazosin (100 nm) + 5 μm FTC (iii) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The assay was similarly performed with 10 μm mitoxantrone dissolved in water. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g. The samples were washed in PBS and resuspended in improved modified Eagle's medium, without (ii) or with (iii) 5 μm FTC and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, the samples were washed in improved modified Eagle's medium, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and placed on ice in the dark. Finally, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACScalibur flow cytometer, and data were analyzed in Cell Quest Pro (BD Biosciences). Biotinylation—Cells (2 × 106) were seeded in a 60-mm dish. After 2 days, the medium was removed, and 2 ml of TBS ± 10 mm TCEP (31Getz E.B. Xiao M. Chakrabarty T. Cooke R. Selvin P.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) was added to the cells for 15 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were incubated in 2 ml of 500 μm biocytin-maleimide for 30 min at room temperature. After removal of the buffer, 2 ml of 10 mm sodium-2-mercapto-ethanesulfonate in TBS was added to the cells for 5 min at room temperature. After washing in TBS, the proteins were solubilized in solubilization buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NEM, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) for 10 min at 4 °C with rotation. After centrifugation at 16000 × g for 10 min, the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured and 200 μg of protein was added to 175 μl of avidin beads (Pierce). After incubation for 1 h with rotation at room temperature, the beads were washed in solubilization buffer. Bound protein was eluted from the beads with loading buffer containing 100 mm DTT by gentle shaking at 95 °C for 10 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the BXP-21 antibody (1:1000). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were seeded on 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine coated coverslips. After 24 h the cells were fixed by adding 3.7% formaldehyde in cold PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:500 anti-ABCG2 [5D3] or 1:200 BXP-21) in blocking buffer for 1 h and washed. Thereafter, the secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorescent probe (1:200 Alexa-488) was added. Finally, the cells were washed three times in PBS before the coverslips were mounted with Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). In each replication of the experiment, all cell lines were stained and visualized in parallel.

Gether U. Litman T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, ABCG2-wt migrates on SDS-PAGE as a dimer (∼160 kDa) in the absence of DTT and as a monomer (∼75 kDa) in the presence of 100 mm DTT. To exclude the possibility that any disulfide bridges irrelevant for the native structure of the protein were formed during the extraction procedure, high concentrations of the sulfhydryl alkylating reagent NEM was added both to the lysis buffer (5 mm) and to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer (10 mm). Based on the predicted topology of ABCG2, there are three cysteines in the large extracellular loop connecting TM5 and TM6: Cys-592, Cys-603, and Cys-608 (Fig. 1). To analyze the influence of each of these putative extracellular cysteines on ABCG2 dimerization, we substituted, one by one, the three cysteines with alanines. The resulting constructs (C592A, C603A, and C608A) were stably expressed in HEK293 cells using the bicistronic vector pCIN4 (28Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting in the presence of increasing concentrations of DTT (Fig. 3). As in the experiment described in the previous paragraph, NEM was present both in the lysis buffer and in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. Fig. 3 shows that, for ABCG2-wt, the amount of monomer increased with the DTT concentration and that 10-50 mm was required for total reduction (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the disulfide bridge-linked dimer was completely absent in the C603A mutant (Fig. 3B). In C592A and C608A, the disulfide-linked dimer was still present, although only scarcely in Cys-608 (Fig. 3, A and C). We observed also, however, a significant amount of monomer in the unreduced samples of C592A and C608A as compared with wt (Fig. 3, A and C). Note that, in all Western blots for which we used the monoclonal BXP-21 antibody, it was observed that the intensity of the fully reduced monomer band is lower than that of the corresponding dimer band. It was observed even though the same amount of protein had been loaded in all of the lanes and the samples were uniformly blotted onto the membrane. We have no obvious explanation for this phenomenon, which also has been reported by others (20Kage K. Tsukahara S. Sugiyama T. Asada S. Ishikawa E. Tsuruo T. Sugimoto Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), except that it could relate to a difference in the reactivity of the antibody toward the monomeric as compared with the dimeric ABCG2. Subsequent immunocytochemistry analysis of the single mutants was in agreement with the Western blot analysis and supported that the wt and C603A mutant were expressed almost exclusively in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, B and D). In comparison, C592A and C608A exhibited less apparent plasma membrane staining and substantially more intracellular staining than in wt and C603A (Fig. 3, A and C). To evaluate the influence of the cysteine mutations on transporter function, we performed a cell survival assay measuring the resistance to mitoxantrone. Fig. 4A shows the inhibition curves from a single experiment, whereas the histogram in Fig. 4B represents normalized LC50 values (mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments). ABCG2-wt showed a marked resistance to mitoxantrone compared with non-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Only in C603A, the resistance to mitoxantrone was directly comparable with wt, whereas C592A and C608A showed significant decrease in resistance of ∼50 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 4B). Because the mitoxantrone resistance is dependent on the expression of the transporter, we did a densitometry analysis of several Western blots to assess overall expression for comparison with the functional data. The analysis was performed on the 100 mm DTT samples, and the results are shown in Fig. 4C. The analysis showed that, although C603A tended to have a higher total expression, there were no significant changes in the expression of C592A and C608A. It is, however, important to correlate this with the immunostainings; i.e. both C592A and C608A displayed less apparent plasma membrane staining and increased intracellular staining, possibly accounting for the reduced activity (Fig. 4B). Altogether, the data support a scenario in which Cys-603 forms a symmetrical intermolecular disulfide bridge that apparently is not crucial for proper targeting and function of the transport protein. The impaired targeting of C592A and C608A led us to hypothesize that these two residues could form a structurally important intramolecular disulfide bridge. To further explore this hypothesis, we mutated two cysteines at a time, resulting in C592A/C603A, C592A/C608A, and C603A/C608A, each of which contained one remaining extracellular cysteine. Fig. 5 shows the reduction of the double cysteine mutants with increasing DTT concentrations. In C592A/C608A, which contained only Cys-603, we observed, in agreement with our hypothesis, efficient dimerization (Fig. 5D). The expression of C592A/C608A was also high and, in fact, increased as compared with the wt (Fig. 6C). In contrast, protein expression was very low in the construct containing only Cys-592 (C603A/C608A) (Figs. 5C and 6C) and slightly lower than wt for C592A/C603A, in which only Cys-608 is present (Figs. 5A and 6C). Notably, we also detected dimer formation in C603A/C608A and C592A/C603A. However, these observations also lend support to our hypothesis; hence, a putative intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys-592 and Cys-608 cannot be formed in these constructs (as well as in the single mutants of Cys-592 and Cys-608), leaving a cysteine free to form a non-native intermolecular disulfide bridge during protein folding and maturation. In contrast to the predicted native disulfide bridge involving Cys-603, such a disulfide bridge might be expected to interfere with targeting/function/expression of the transporter. This was further supported by immunocytochemistry and functional analysis. Staining of the transfected HEK293 cells showed that, although C592A/C608A (Fig. 5D) mostly resembled the membrane-localized expression pattern of wt (Fig. 5B), C592A/C603A displayed largely intracellular staining (Fig. 5A), and C603A/C608A was hardly visible (Fig. 5C). In further consistency with these observations, the cell survival assay revealed that Cys-603 alone displayed mitoxantrone resistance close (although not identical) to the wt (∼70%) (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas both Cys-608 alone and Cys-592 alone displayed an almost identical low resistance of ∼10 and 5% of the wt, respectively (Fig. 6, A and B). The histogram in Fig. 6B represents the same average values of three experiments as the one shown in Fig. 6A. The overall expression of the constructs based on densitometry analysis is shown in Fig. 6C. The analysis correlated generally well with the functional data. For both C603A/C608A and C592A/C603A, we observed a marked decrease in resistance to mitoxantrone and a concomitant decrease in expression (Fig. 6, B and C). For C592A/C608A, we observed, nonetheless, an increase in expression (Fig. 6C). Together with the slightly decreased function (Fig. 6B), this might suggest at least a partial functional impairment in this construct that contains Cys-603 as the only extracellular cysteine. We also substituted all three extracellular cysteines in ABCG2 simultaneously (C592A/C603A/C608A). This inhibited completely the disulfide bridge-linked dimerization of the transporter (Fig. 7A) and decreased considerably both transporter function (Fig. 8, A and B) and protein expression (Figs. 7A and 8C). Specifically, we were almost unable to detect any expressed protein in the immunostainings (Fig. 7B) To further explore the function of the hypothesized disulfide bridges, we performed efflux experiments on the mutants containing either both Cys-592 and Cys-608 (C603A), predicted to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge, or Cys-603 only (C592A/C608A), predicted to form an intermolecular disulfide bridge (Fig. 9).

A stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide and of tetrathionate (S4O62−) inhibited rat MST (ki = 3.3 min–1, Ki = 120.5 μm and ki = 2.5 min–1, Ki = 178.6 μm, respectively). The activity was completely restored by dithiothreitol or thioredoxin with a reducing system containing thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, but glutathione did not restore the activity. On the other hand, an excess molar ratio dose of hydrogen peroxide inactivated MST. Oxidation with a stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide protected the enzyme against reaction by iodoacetate, which modifies a catalytic Cys247, suggesting that Cys247 is a target of the oxidants. A matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis revealed that hydrogen peroxide- and tetrathionate-inhibited MSTs were increased in molecular mass consistent with the addition of atomic oxygen and with a thiosulfate (S2O3−), respectively. Treatment with dithiothreitol restored modified MST to the original mass. These findings suggested that there was no nearby cysteine with which to form a disulfide, and mild oxidation of MST resulted in formation of a sulfenate (SO–) at Cys247, which exhibited exceptional stability and a lower redox potential than that of glutathione. Oxidative stress decreases MST activity so as to increase the amount of cysteine, a precursor of thioredoxin or glutathione, and furthermore, these cellular reductants restore the activity. Thus the redox state regulates MST activity at the enzymatic level, and on the other hand, MST controls redox to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) (EC 2.8.1.2), a multifunctional enzyme, catalyzes a transsulfuration from mercaptopyruvate to pyruvate in the degradation process of cysteine.

However, a physiological role of the rapid inhibition-reactivation cycle of these enzymes has not been focused.

Further, the redox potential of cysteine-sulfenate was estimated to be higher than that of glutathione (29Jones D.P. Go Y.M. Anderson C.L. Ziegler T.R. Kinkade J.M. Kirlin W.G.

The formation of a stable sulfenyl thiosulfate at the catalytic cysteine implied that a nearby cysteine to form a disulfide bond was not present. Peroxidase activity was another supporting evidence of a sulfenate formation (33Mallett J.C. Parsonage D. Claiborne A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3000-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Nandi D.J. Howowitz P.M. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. 2000; 32: 465-473Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Yeh J.I.

Shimizu T. Tsuchiya T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and hydrogen peroxide did not change the amount of MST mRNA in Hep3B cells, 3N. Nagahara, unpublished data. 3N. Nagahara, unpublished data. suggesting that MST activity is regulated at the enzymatic level. Mosharov et al. (37Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) have reported that in the cysteine anabolic pathway hydrogen peroxide promotes the activity of cystathionine β-synthase and suppresses the activity of methionine synthase at the transcriptional level, resulting in a facilitation of the metabolic flow to cystathionine. Consequently the amount of cysteine increased, and cellular reductants such as glutathione and thioredoxin were overproduced (38Dickinson D.A. Moellering D.R. I Ies K.E. Patel R.P. Levonen A.L. Wigley A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Forman H.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that MST is rapidly regulated at the enzyme level by the redox state, which in turn is associated with the control of cysteine degradation. These results suggest that MST helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis. Preparation of Wild Type and Mutant MSTs—Rat wild type and C247S (in which the catalytic site Cys247 is replaced with serine) MST cDNAs were prepared according to a procedure described previously (11Nagahara N. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). C247S was used only in SH group titration. Complementary DNAs coding single mutant MSTs (C64S, C154S, C254S, and C263S) were synthesized by PCR using TaKaRa LA Taq with GC buffer (TAKARA BIO Inc. Otsu, Japan); wild type MST cDNA inserted in pBluescript (SK+) vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as templates for mutant MSTs. The primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: rC64S-s (sense primer), CGATCGTAGCAGCGACCACACATCGCCC, and rC64S-A (antisense primer), GGGCGATGTGTGGTCGCTGCTACGATCG, for the C64S mutant; rC154S-s, CCTGCGGAGTTCAGCGCGCAGCTCGAT, and rC154S-A, ATCGAGCTGCGCGCTGAACTCCGCAGG, for the C154S mutant; rC254S-s, GGTGTCACAGCCAGCCACGTGGTCCTG, and rC254S-A, CAGGACCACGTGGCTGGCTGTGAACC, for the C254S mutant; rC263S-s, GGGGCCTTCCTCTCTGGCAAACCCGATG, and rC263S-A, CATCGGGTTTGCCAGAGAGGAAGGCCCC, for the C263S mutant. Each mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The cycling parameters for PCR were as follows: for the first segment, one cycle of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and for the second segment, 13 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 8.6 min. The PCR product was treated with DpnI and introduced into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue according to the usual protocol except for a pre-culture in LB medium without antibiotics at 37 °C for 1 h before plating. Sequencing was performed to select each mutagenized cDNA using the synthesized antisense primers GCAGGTTCTGGCTCAGCCA, TGTCCAGGTTCGATGCCATC, and AGGATGGTTCGGTGTCAC to examine the replacement of each of Cys64, Cys154, Cys254, and Cys263 with serine, respectively. Each mutagenized cDNA of MST was digested from each construct (between the NcoI and XhoI sites) and was inserted into a pET28a vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA) (between the NcoI and XhoI sites). Overexpression and Purification—Each pET28a vector containing cDNA of the wild type or mutant MST was introduced into E. coli, BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with a pSTV vector containing GroEL and GroES cDNAs (kindly provided by Dr. Matsumura, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Nippon Medical School). The cells were cultured at 27 °C in LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Wako Pure Chemicals) was added at a final concentration of 1 mm when the A600 reached 0.9. Cells were cultured at 37 °C for 2.5 h and collected. Each recombinant MST was purified as described previously (21Claiborne A. Miller H. Paesonage D. Ross R.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Inhibition and Inactivation of MSTs—Tetrathionate cannot be mixed with cyanide because the addition of cyanide to tetrathionate causes its decomposition. Thus, MST was first incubated with tetrathionate or hydrogen peroxide, and a 5-μl aliquot was taken from the preincubation mixture. Then the remaining activity was measured separately in an assay system described under “Assay for Rhodanese Activity of MST.” For studying the inhibition or inactivation of 20 μm wild type MST, 20 μm or 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide (Wako Pure Chemicals) or tetrathionate (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was incubated in 60 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for a predetermined period of time (as described in each experiment). For studying the inhibition or inactivation of mutant enzymes, 20 μm C64S, C154S, C254S, or C263S was incubated with 20 μm or 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide or tetrathionate in 60 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 1, 10, and 20 min. The remaining activity is shown as a percentage of the activity of the untreated control enzyme. Inhibition Kinetic Study—20 μm MST and predetermined concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or tetrathionate (see figure legends) were incubated in 60 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for a predetermined period of time (see figure legends). Then, a 5-μl aliquot was taken from the preincubation mixture, and each rhodanese activity of MST was assayed. The kinetic analysis was performed basically according to the Kitz and Wilson method (39Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each t½ value (time when the remaining activity is 50% of the untreated control activity) was determined from a semilog plot of v/v0 versus time (v0 being the reaction rate when inhibitor = 0 mm). The ki value (inhibition rate constant) was determined from a replot of the t½ value versus 1/[I] (inhibitor). This relationship can be represented by the following equations, Ki=[I][E][EI] where Ki = the dissociation constant of the EI complex, E = enzyme, and EI = enzyme-inhibitor noncovalent complex and [E]=[e]1+[I]Ki(Eq.2) where [e] = the concentration of MST when time is t, and [e] = [E] + [EI]. The inhibition velocity equation is as follows. −d[e]dt=ki[EI]=kiKi[I][E](Eq.3) Equations 2 and 3 can be rearranged to the following. −d[e][E]=kiKi[I]dt=−d[e][e](1+[I]Ki)(Eq.4) Integration of Equation 4 leads to the following, In[e]E0=−ki1+Ki[I] ⋅ t where E0 = the initial concentration of the enzyme. The ratio of the remaining enzyme activity can be represented as follows. 1+In[e]E0=1−ki1+Ki[I]⋅t(Eq.6) Equation 6 can be rearranged to the following. t1/2=−In0.5ki−KiIn0.5ki⋅1[I] Reactivation of Hydrogen Peroxide- and Tetrathionate-inhibited MSTs by DTT—After incubation of 20 μm wild type and mutant MSTs with 20 μm or 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide, or 20 μm or 0.5 mm tetrathionate in 60 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, free oxidants were removed from each sample and a control with a NAP5 column (Amersham Biosciences), and each mixture was concentrated to 20 μm with a VIVASPIN (10,000MWCO. PES, Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). A 5-μl aliquot was taken from the mixture and mixed with 1 μl of 10 mm (1.6 mm at a final concentration) DTT (Fluka, Osaka, Japan) solution. Each mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Comparative Study for Reactivation of MST by DTT, Cysteine, Thioredoxin, or Glutathione—After incubation of 20 μm wild type MST with 20 μm tetrathionate or hydrogen peroxide on ice for 20 min in 60 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, free oxidants were removed from each sample and a control with a NAP5 column. The enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 20 μm with a VIVASPIN. In the experiment using l-cysteine (Kanto Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan) or DTT, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, 25.6, 51.2, or 102.4 mm cysteine or 1.6 mm DTT was added to 30 μl of the mixture taken from the concentrated sample, and the total volume was adjusted to 60 μl in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. After gel filtration with a NAP5 column, the enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 20 μm with a VIVASPIN. Then a 5-ml aliquot taken from the mixture was used for the assay of rhodanese activity In the experiment using recombinant E. coli thioredoxin (kindly provided by Dr. Abe, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Nippon Medical School) or yeast glutathione (Sigma) with the reducing system, 30 μl of the mixture taken from the concentrated MST sample was added to the reducing system. The reducing system contained 50 μm NADPH (Sigma), 10 μm thioredoxin or glutathione, and 0.2 μm recombinant E. coli thioredoxin reductase (Dr. Abe) or 0.2 μm glutathione reductase (Roche Applied Science) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The total volume was adjusted to 60 μl, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. After gel filtration, each activity was assayed in the same way as described above. In the experiment using reduced thioredoxin or reduced glutathione, 2 μl of 50 mm DTT was added to 198 μl of 50 μm thioredoxin and glutathione, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. After gel filtration with a NAP5 column, each sample was concentrated to 30 μm with a Microcon-3 (Millipore). 30 μl of the concentrated MST sample was mixed with 10 μm reduced thioredoxin or reduced glutathione in 60 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and each mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. After gel filtration, each activity was assayed in the same way as described above. SH Group Titration—In the titration of the oxidized enzymes, after incubation of the wild type and five mutant MSTs (300 μm) with a 300 μm or 1.5 mm hydrogen peroxide in 30 μl of 33 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, on ice for 20 min, free oxidants were removed from each sample with a NAP5 column. In the titration of the reduced enzymes, oxygen in the solvent was removed using a glass apparatus by sequential evacuation and re-equilibration with oxygen-free argon. Oxygen-free argon was prepared by passing commercially obtained pure argon through a column of a Chromtopack Gas-Clean Oxygen Filter CP17970 (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). After incubation of 300 μm wild type and the five mutant MSTs with 5 mm DTT in 30 μl of 33 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, on ice overnight under anaerobic conditions, free DTT was removed from each sample with a NAP5 column before analysis. Each enzyme (20–60 μm) was incubated with 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) or 0.6 mm NBD-Cl at 25 °C for 60 min, and the change in absorbance at 412 nm (ϵ412 = 13,600 m–1) or at 420 nm (ϵ420 = 13,000 m–1) (21Claiborne A. Miller H. Paesonage D. Ross R.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), respectively, was measured. The number of SH groups/subunit was calculated. A Target Residue of Oxidants—To investigate the protection of Cys247 by oxidants against inactivation via carboxymethylation by iodoacetate (Nakalai Tesque), after incubation of 17 μm MST with 17 μm hydrogen peroxide or tetrathionate in 60 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, free oxidants were removed from each mixture and a control group without oxidation with a NAP5 column. The enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 60 μl with a VIVASPIN. Iodoacetate was added to the two experimental groups with oxidation and a control group without oxidation at a concentration of 1 mm, and the mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min. After gel filtration of each mixture with a NAP5 column, the enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 40 μl with VIVASPIN. 5 μl of the mixture was incubated with 5 μl of 2 mm DTT or the same buffer at 25 °C for 20 min. The values of the rhodanese activity remaining were determined. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometric Analysis for Oxidized MSTs—After 12 μm MST was incubated with 12 μm tetrathionate, 12 μm hydrogen peroxide, or 0.6 mm hydrogen peroxide in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, each mixture was treated with gel filtration with a NAP5 column to remove free oxidants. For a control experiment, 12 μm MST was incubated without tetrathionate or hydrogen peroxide, and the mixture was treated with gel filtration with a NAP5 column. Each enzyme-containing fraction was collected and concentrated to 60 μl with VIVASPIN. For reduction of each oxidized enzyme, 30 μl of each sample was treated with 0.6 mm DTT at 25 °C for 20 min, and free DTT was removed with a NAP5 column. The enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 20 μl with a VIVASPIN. To examine whether the hydrogen peroxide-inhibited MST was modified with dimedone (Tokyo Kasei Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 1.5 mm MST was incubated with 1.5 mm hydrogen peroxide in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min. After gel filtration of the mixture with a NAP5 column, the enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 36 μl with a VIVASPIN. The solution was incubated with 50 mm dimedone on ice for 30 min. After gel filtration of the solution with a NAP5 column, the enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 43 μl with a VIVASPIN. Each sample was desalted with Zip Tip C18 (Millipore), and 0.5 μl of the sample in 70% acetonitrile (Wako Pure Chemicals) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals) was mixed with 0.5 μl of sinapinic acid (Bruker Daltonics, Brumen, Germany) saturated in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture was dried at room temperature on the target plate. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Reflex III (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometer equipped with a SCOUT 384 ion source laser, operating in the linear positive mode at a 20-kV acceleration voltage. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging 300 individual laser shots. External mass calibration was performed using the protein mixture of protein calibration standard II (Bruker Daltonics). In the mass spectrometric analysis of a chemical modification of 30–40 of kDa protein using our system, mass measurement error was 0.03%. Peroxidase Activity of MST—The assay mixture contained 0.2 mm NADPH, 40 μm recombinant E. coli thioredoxin, and 1 μm recombinant E. coli thioredoxin reductase in 500 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. With monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, 10 μm hydrogen peroxide was added to the mixture, and 300 min later, 10, 20, 40, or 60 μm wild type MST was added. The rate of decrease in NADPH was calculated (ϵ340 = 6220 m–1). For a control study, C247S was used instead of wild type MST. Assay for Rhodanese Activity of MST—A procedure to measure the activity catalyzing a transsulfuration from mercaptopyruvate to β-mercaptoethanol would not be appropriate for this experiment, because β-mercaptoethanol would be able to reduce a sulfenate or a sulfenyl thiosulfate formed at a catalytic site cysteine during incubation in the assay mixture, as MST possesses rhodanese activity catalyzing transsulfuration from thiosulfate to cyanide (10Nagahara N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and it is this rhodanese activity of MST that was measured. On the other hand, the amount of thiosulfate that is a derivative of tetrathionate was negligible in the rhodanese activity assay because only a very small amount of the compound was diluted further in the assay mixture. Protein Determination—The protein concentrations were determined with a Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology) with crystalline bovine serum albumin (ICN Biochemicals) as the standard. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the mean ± the S.E. The significance of difference between values was estimated with Student's t test. Data Fitting—The fitting of the data obtained from the kinetic studies was done with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Inhibition Kinetics of Wild Type MST Using Inhibitors Hydrogen Peroxide and Tetrathionate—Inhibition of MST by hydrogen peroxide (E°′= 1.76 mV) and tetrathionate (E°′= 1.07 mV (40Das T.N. Huie R.E. Neta P. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 3581-3588Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) proceeded in a dose- and time-dependent manner and exhibited pseudo first-order kinetics with ki = 3.3 ± 0.2 and 2.5 ± 0.2 min–1, respectively (n = 3, mean ± S.E.) and Ki = 120.5 ± 10.5 and 178.6 ± 12.2 μm, respectively (n = 3) (Fig. 1). Inhibition and Inactivation of MSTs by Hydrogen Peroxide and Tetrathionate and Reactivation by DTT—20 μm hydrogen peroxide decreased the activity ratios of the 20 μm wild type and mutant (C64S, C154S, C254S, and C263S) MSTs for each control activity to 6.0 ± 0.6, 11.5 ± 0.9, 12.0 ± 1.1, 10.3 ± 0.9, and 8.3 ± 0.7% (n = 3), respectively. The addition of 1.6 mm DTT restored them to 90.1 ± 8.7, 88.1 ± 7.9, 84.0 ± 6.2, 98.1 ± 7.7, and 93.3 ± 9.1% (n = 3) of each control activity, respectively, within 10 min. Each inhibition-reactivation pattern was not significantly different among these enzymes. The activity of oxidized wild type MST was restored by DTT in a time-dependent manner, and the time course was formulated as y = 62.9 + 27.7 log t (where y is the percent of control enzyme activit"
https://openalex.org/W2018518082,"Rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies) is currently being used in the treatment of B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We have recently reported that rituximab triggers and modifies various intracellular signaling pathways in NHL B-cell lines, resulting in reverting the chemoresistant phenotype to a sensitive phenotype. This study investigated whether rituximab also modifies intracellular signaling pathways resulting in the sensitization of NHL cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. Treatment of the Fas-resistant NHL cell lines (2F7, Ramos and Raji) with rituximab sensitized the cells to CH-11 (FasL agonist mAb)-induced apoptosis and synergy was achieved. Fas expression was upregulated by rituximab as early as 6 h post-treatment as determined by flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Rituximab inhibited both the expression and activity of the transcription repressor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) that negatively regulates Fas transcription. Inhibition of YY1 resulted in the upregulation of Fas expression and sensitization of the tumor cells to CH-11-induced apoptosis. The downregulation of YY1 expression was the result of rituximab-induced inhibition of both the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and constitutive nuclear factor κ of B cells (NF-κB) activity. The involvement of NF-κB and YY1 in the regulation of Fas expression was corroborated by the use of Ramos cells with a dominant-active inhibitor of NF-κB (Ramos IκB-estrogen receptor (ER) mutant) and by silencing YY1 with YY1 siRNA, respectively. Further, the role of rituximab-mediated inhibition of the p38 MAPK/NF-κB/YY1 pathway in the regulation of Fas and sensitization to CH-11-induced apoptosis was validated by the use of specific chemical inhibitors of this pathway and which mimicked rituximab-mediated effects. These findings provide a novel mechanism of rituximab-mediated activity by sensitizing NHL cells to Fas-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2142048380,"It has been proposed that γ-secretase-mediated release of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) results in nuclear translocation and signaling through a complex with the adaptor protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60. Here, we show that APP and Fe65 activate transcription through a Gal4-Tip60 reporter in presenilin-1/2-deficient cells lacking generation of AICD. APP and Fe65 also activated transcription in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors that prevent amyloid β-peptide production in human embryonic kidney 293 and SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast to the transcriptionally active Notch intracellular domain, expression of AICD did not activate transcription. An alternative mechanism for APP signal transduction is suggested by the identification of essential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation sites in Tip60. Mutation of these Tip60 phosphorylation sites or treatment with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine blocked the ability of APP to signal through Tip60. Moreover, APP stabilized Tip60 through CDK-dependent phosphorylation. Subcellular fractionation and confocal immunofluorescence showed that APP recruited Tip60 to membrane compartments. Thus, APP may signal to the nucleus by a γ-secretase-independent mechanism that involves membrane sequestration and phosphorylation of Tip60.

APP is a type 1 transmembrane protein that resembles a cell-surface receptor (1Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3943) Google Scholar). Studies on APP biology have focused primarily on its proteolytic processing. APP undergoes two separate proteolytic pathways that have been termed the non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 2Lichtenthaler S.F. Haass C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1384-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by α-secretase, generating the C-terminal transmembrane fragment C83. The amyloidogenic pathway involves cleavage by the β-secretase BACE, generating the C-terminal fragment C99, which is then cleaved by γ-secretase to generate the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and the C50/APP intracellular domain (AICD) fragment. This series of proteolytic events of ectodomain shedding followed by intramembrane cleavage is reminiscent of the processing of the Notch receptor following binding to its ligands (reviewed in Ref. 3Selkoe D. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Both APP and Notch require the presenilins for γ-secretase cleavage within the membrane (4Song W.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The pathogenic autosomal dominant mutations in APP and the presenilins lead to increased generation of the fibrillogenic peptide Aβ42, which forms amyloid plaques, one of the hallmark pathogenic lesions of Alzheimer disease (reviewed in Refs. 8Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar and 9Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aβ is neurotoxic both in vitro and in vivo (10Yankner B.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 11Geula C. Wu C.K. Saroff D. Lorenzo A. Yuan M. Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the amyloid hypothesis, which proposes that the accumulation of Aβ in the brain causes neurodegeneration and the dementia of Alzheimer disease. However, despite the significant effort spent investigating the properties of APP, its biological function and the reason for its cleavage remain enigmatic. There is evidence that APP plays a role in cell adhesion, axonal transport, neurite outgrowth, and, recently, signal transduction (12Breen K.C. Bruce M. Anderton B.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Chen M. Yankner B.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 125: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A.

Science. 2001; 293: 115-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that APP may signal by a mechanism similar to that of the Notch receptor, in which the intracellular tail released by presenilin/γ-secretase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. This idea was supported by the observation that APP, together with the adaptor protein Fe65, could activate the transcriptional activity of the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (18Cao X Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Thus, presenilins may mediate the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a number of transmembrane proteins that release soluble intracellular domains that carry out signaling functions (reviewed in Refs. 19Ebinu J.O. Yankner B.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 20Koo E. Kopan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10 (-S33): S26Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein Fe65 contains three protein interaction domains: the WW domain, which binds proline-rich sequences, and two C-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domains, which interact with Tip60 and APP, respectively (18Cao X Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 21Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol.

Fe65 and APP have been placed within a biological pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, as the respective mutants have similar pharyngeal pumping phenotypes (22Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Arbucci S. Gianni D. Russo T. Bazzicalupo P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1411-1422PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Fe65 can lead to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of AICD, where it may induce apoptosis through Tip60 (23Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

In addition, Tip60 and its histone acetyltransferase activity have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair (26Gaughan L. Brady M.E. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46841-46848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

However, the mechanism underlying the ability of APP to regulate Tip60-mediated transcription has not been determined. In this study, we provide evidence that, in contrast to Notch, APP is able to activate transcription through Tip60 independently of γ-secretase cleavage by recruiting Tip60 to the membrane, leading to Tip60 activation through cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation. This is followed by nuclear translocation of Tip60 and Fe65 and activation of transcription. Cell Lines and Treatments—Embryonic stem cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units of leukemia inhibitory factor, and 0.008% 2-mercaptoethanol. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were treated with 10 μm roscovitine (Sigma), 20 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Sigma), or 20 nm leptomycin B (LC Laboratories). γ-Secretase inhibitors WPE-II-72 and WPE-III-31c were obtained from Michael Wolfe, and cells were treated at 500 nm and 5 μm, respectively, which are 25 times their IC50 values. In the dephosphorylation assay, 5 μl of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.) or H2O was added to 40 μl of sample plus 5 μl of NE Buffer 3, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2× sample buffer. Transfection and Plasmids—Cells were transfected using Lipo-fectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Basically, the cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM I, followed by the addition of a mixture of Opti-MEM I, DNA, and Lipo-fectamine 2000. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 3-5 h, at which time an equivalent volume of the medium was added along with appropriate drug treatments. The plasmids used were as follows: pM-Tip60 (for Gal4-Tip60), pCMV-Fe65, and pCMV-Myc-Fe65-(128-711) (obtained from T. C. Sudhof); pCMV-APP695wt; pcDNA-C50; pcDNA-C50-Myc; pcDNA-HA-Tip60 and pcDNA-HA-Tip60s86/90a (obtained from S. Khochbin); pM-Gal4-Tip60wt (generated by subcloning hemagglutinin (HA)-Tip60 by cutting the pM and HA-Tip60 vectors with EcoRI and XbaI); pM-Gal4-Tip60s86/90a (generated by subcloning HA-Tip60 by cutting the pM and HA-Tip60 vectors with EcoRI and XbaI); pRK-PS1wt; pFR-luciferase (Stratagene); pRL-TK (Renilla; Promega); HES1-luciferase; mNotchΔE; pcDNA-NICD; and pcDNA3 empty vector (to normalize total DNA). Transactivation Assays—Cells were plated onto 24-well plates and transfected when ∼70-80% confluent. Three wells were transfected per treatment. We optimized DNA concentrations for the signaling assay in 293 cells: 0.2 μg of pFR-luciferase, 0.05 μg of pRL-TK, 0.2 μg of pM-Gal4-Tip60, 0.2 μg of pCMV-Myc-Fe65-(128-711), and 0.1 μg of pCMV-APP695wt per well. The pCMV-Myc-Fe65-(128-711) plasmid was used because it was shown previously to act similarly to full-length Fe65 (18Cao X Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) and, in our hands, required a lower amount of DNA to allow activation of the reporter by Tip60. Additionally, this construct has a Myc tag, which facilitated confirmation of equivalent expression by Western blotting between different conditions. Approximately 20-24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed with Promega passive lysis buffer. Assays were then performed (Dual-Luciferase kit, Promega) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was read with a Wallac VICTOR Model 1420 multilabel counter. To control for transfection efficiency, the activity of the firefly luciferase reporter driven by the GAL4 promoter was normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase reporter (PRL-TK). The -fold induction was then determined as the average of three wells per treatment normalized to the average signal of the reporter-alone wells. Antibodies—Anti-HA antibody was obtained from Sigma. To detect Tip60, we used antibody N1 (a kind gift of John Lough) (29McAllister D. Merlo X. Lough J. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 289: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Paul Greengard generously provided anti-Fe65 antibody (30Sabo S.L. Lanier L.M. Ikin A.F. Khorkova O. Sahasrabudhe S. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7952-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We used rabbit antibody C8, which is directed against the APP C terminus. Anti-Aβ antibodies 159 and 6E10 were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, respectively. Anti-lamin B2 antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. We purchased anti-actin antibody from Oncogene Science. Mouse monoclonal antibody 56C6 (Lab Vision Corp.) was used for neprilysin. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline when ∼90% confluent and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. They were then washed with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μm microcystin, 1 mm NaVO4, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The cells were swelled for 10 min in buffer A, followed by 20× Dounce homogenization with a glass pestle. Nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The pellet and supernatant were separated, and the pellet was lysed with deoxycholate-containing radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA-DOC) plus phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na2P2O7, 1 μm microcystin, and 1 mm NaVO4) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture and saved as the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was then combined with 0.11 volume of buffer B (0.3 m HEPES-KOH, 1.4 m KCl, 0.03 m MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μm microcystin, 1 mm NaVO4, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture), followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA-DOC with the same phosphatase and protease inhibitors and saved as the membrane fraction. The supernatant was then saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. Transgenic Mice—The cortices and hippocampi were dissected from 3-month-old and 2-year-old Tg2576 APP transgenic mice. We used two animals of each genotype and age. The brain samples were then subjected to fractionation as described above. Briefly, the brain samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and swelled in buffer A for 10 min, followed by Dounce homogenization with a glass pestle. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then combined with 0.11 volume of buffer B and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA-DOC and used as the membrane fraction for Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, protein lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by an overnight incubation with the immunoprecipitating antibodies. The next morning, fresh protein G-Sepharose was added and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by three washes with RIPA-DOC for the anti-HA antibody immunoprecipitations and with phosphate-buffered saline for the antibody 159 immunoprecipitations. Proteins were then eluted from beads by boiling in 2× sample buffer for 5 min. In the Aβ immunoprecipitation/Western blot experiments, HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells transiently transfected with Tip60, Fe65, and APP and the 20E2 APPsw-expressing HEK-293 stable cell line were incubated for 48 or 24 h, respectively, to condition the medium. The γ-secretase inhibitor was added at the beginning of the conditioning at a final concentration of 500 nm, which is 25 times the IC50 value. For transient transfection, additional γ-secretase inhibitor was added after 24 h at 12.5 times the IC50 value to compensate for turnover of the inhibitor. The conditioned medium was collected and spun at 1000 rpm for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Anti-Aβ antibody 159 was added to the conditioned medium and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The next morning, protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added and rocked 4 °C for 2 h. The protein A-Sepharose was then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and Aβ was eluted from the beads with 2× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. In the experiments on APP stabilization of Tip60, the cells were collected 24 h post-transfection using Promega passive lysis buffer. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and equivalent cell lysates were loaded onto the gel for Western blotting. Immunocytochemistry—SH-SY5Y cells were plated onto coverslips in 24-well plates 2 days prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with HA-Tip60 alone or with Fe65 and APP as described above and then incubated for ∼24 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 10% donkey serum for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with anti-HA antibody and antibody C8 to detect Tip60 and APP, respectively. The next day, we used Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody to label Tip60 and Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody to label APP. Finally, Hoechst stain was included in the first wash to label the nuclei. Images were then taken with a Zeiss confocal microscope. APP Signaling in Presenilin-deficient Cells—Activation of the Notch signaling pathway requires γ-secretase cleavage by the presenilins to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes. To determine whether APP could signal to the nucleus by a similar mechanism, we utilized embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient in both presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (presenilin-1/2 knockout (PS-KO) cells). These cells are deficient in γ-secretase cleavage of APP and do not secrete Aβ (6Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To address the potential signaling function of APP, we used the Gal4-Tip60 fusion construct, previously shown to activate a Gal4-luciferase reporter upon cotransfection of both Fe65 and APP (18Cao X Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). This is a more physiological system for measuring the signaling ability of APP compared with APP-Gal4 assays, as it does not rely on the fusion of an artificial DNA-binding domain to APP itself. As reported previously (18Cao X Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), significant transactivation by Gal4-Tip60 occurred only upon coexpression of both Fe65 and APP (Fig. 1A). APP signaling was reduced by ∼45% in PS-KO cells relative to wild-type ES cells and was rescued upon expression of presenilin-1 (PS1) (Fig. 1A). A γ-secretase inhibitor reduced APP signaling in wild-type cells to a level comparable with that in PS-KO cells (data not shown). PS-KO cells were resistant to the γ-secretase inhibitor, consistent with the lack of γ-secretase activity in these cells. However, APP retained the ability to activate Tip60 in the absence of presenilins, suggesting that γ-secretase cleavage of APP is not required for activation of Tip60. This contrasts with Notch signaling, which was completely inhibited in PS-KO cells (Fig. 1B). These results were confirmed in two independently derived wild-type and presenilin-deficient cell lines, indicating that presenilin-independent APP signaling is not a unique property of an individual presenilin-deficient cell line. These results suggest that APP may signal through a mechanism that is distinct from that of the Notch pathway, despite similar mechanisms of proteolytic processing. We then confirmed that presenilin-deficient cells fail to generate detectable levels of the C50 fragment corresponding to AICD. We probed lysates from either wild-type ES or PS-KO cells transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type APP (APPwt), C50/AICD, or APPsw. Immunoblot analyses of wild-type cells expressing APPwt or APPsw with an antibody raised against the APP C terminus showed a band at ∼6 kDa that comigrated with transfected C50/AICD (Fig. 1C). However, PS-KO cells expressing APPwt or APPsw did not show a clear 6-kDa band, although this band appeared in PS-KO cells transfected with the C50/AICD plasmid. Thus, APP is able to activate Tip60 by a mechanism that does not require γ-secretase generation of C50/AICD. We then confirmed that presenilins are required for Notch signaling, in contrast to APP signaling, which did not require presenilins. We expressed the activated Notch construct mNotchΔE, which encodes a truncated Notch-1 protein retaining the transmembrane domain, together with a Notch-1-responsive HES1-luciferase reporter. mNotchΔE was able to drive significant transactivation of the HES1 reporter in wild-type cells, but this signaling ability was absent in PS-KO cells (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous reports (6Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Expression of presenilin in the PS-KO cells rescued the ability of mNotchΔE to activate the HES1 reporter (Fig. 1B). This shows that the lack of Notch signaling in presenilin-deficient cells is due solely to the lack of presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage of mNotchΔE. Further illustrating this point, a similar level of transactivation was obtained upon expression of soluble NICD in both wild-type and presenilin-deficient cells (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that both cell lines are similarly competent in signal transduction. These results suggest that presenilin-deficient cells cannot carry out signaling that requires γ-secretase activity, yet these cells can support APP-mediated activation of Tip60. Thus, APP may signal through an alternative mechanism. γ-Secretase Independence of APP Signaling—To confirm this surprising γ-secretase-independent mode of APP signaling, we performed similar assays in HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells. As expected, we observed significant transactivation only upon coexpression of Fe65 and APP (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor WPE-II-72 at 25 times the IC50 value did not significantly affect APP-Tip60 signaling in HEK-293 or SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This concentration of the γ-secretase inhibitor greatly decreased Aβ production (Fig. 2C) and markedly increased accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The γ-secretase independence of APP signaling was further confirmed using another γ-secretase inhibitor, WPE-III-31c, in both HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). These results confirm that APP nuclear signaling through Tip60 can occur independently of γ-secretase cleavage. To further examine the role of AICD in this signal transduction pathway, we replaced APP in the signaling assay with a C50 construct in HEK-293 cells. C50 had essentially no signaling ability (Fig. 2A, upper panel), in contrast to the signaling-competent Notch-derived NICD (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we observed that C50 had a dominant-negative effect in which it decreased APP signaling when coexpressed with APP (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Immunoblot analysis of lysates showed equivalent levels of APP expression (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Similar results were obtained in APP signaling assays in wild-type ES and PS-KO cells (data not shown). These results suggest that C50/AICD does not activate transcription through Tip60, but rather acts as a dominant-negative protein in this signaling pathway. It has been suggested that APP may be able to carry out signal transduction through cleavage by caspases at a cleavage site within its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (31Kim H.S. Kim E.M. Lee J.P.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16161-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we used the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone in another series of luciferase assays in HEK-293 cells. Inhibiting caspase activity with benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone failed to significantly affect the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig. 3A). Notably, there was still no effect on APP signaling when both γ-secretase and caspase inhibitors were added together. Similar results were observed in the wild-type ES and PS-KO cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, APP retains the ability to activate Tip60 signaling in the absence of cleavage by either γ-secretase or caspases. A recent study identified the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin as a potential transcriptional target of C50/AICD (33Pardossi-Piquard R. Petit A. Kawarai T. Sunyach C. Alves da Costa C. Vincent B.

We attempted to confirm these results using our wild-type ES and PS-KO cell lines. We observed significant cell line variability in the levels of endogenous neprilysin that did not correlate with presenilin genotype (Fig. 3C), indicating that the variation is not related to presenilin expression. Furthermore, we attempted to elevate neprilysin levels in PS-KO cells by overexpression of PS1, C50, or C50-Myc. We did not observe any reproducible changes in neprilysin levels upon expression of any of the plasmids 24 h after transfection (Fig. 3, D and E). We confirmed that both PS1 and C50-Myc were expressed by Western blotting (Fig. 3, D and E). Moreover, we confirmed that transfected PS1 was functional, as it rescued the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments that was observed in the absence of γ-secretase cleavage of APP (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed in HEK-293 cells transfected with C50 or C50-Myc (data not shown). These results suggest that neprilysin may not be a transcriptional target of C50/AICD.

We undertook a co-expression search using the Genesis Enterprise System Database from Gene Logic to identify prostasin inhibitors, on the assumption that prostasin and its natural inhibitors may have a similar gene expression pattern. We found the expression profile of prostasin in normal human tissues to correlate highly with hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1B (HAI-1B) and its splice variant HAI-1. Soluble HAI-1B (sHAI-1B), comprising the entire extracellular domain, formed a 1:1 complex with purified prostasin in protein binding assays and inhibited prostasin enzymatic activity with an IC50 of 66 ± 15 nm. Two sHAI-1B mutants with inactivated N- and C-terminal Kunitz domains (KD1 and KD2) were used to show that the interaction of sHAI-1B with prostasin is mediated by KD1. In agreement, KD1 (Thr246-Val303) alone potently inhibited prostasin activity (IC50 = 4.7 ± 0.5 nm). Furthermore, prostasin was isolated with two major HAI-1/1B fragments (40 and 58 kDa) from OVCAR3 cell medium, demonstrating that prostasin·HAI-1/1B complexes are formed naturally. Moreover, when prostasin and HAI-1B were co-expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, complexes of prostasin with HAI-1B were detected on the cell membrane as well as in the culture medium, suggesting that preformed complexes were shed from the cell surface.

This assumption is supported by previous experimental work showing co-expression of other pairs of effector molecules and their endogenous inhibitors. For example, granzyme B has been found to be expressed in the same cells as its inhibitor PI-9 (SERPINB9) in humans (26Muthukumar T. Ding R. Dadhania D. Medeiros M. Li B. Sharma V.K. Hartono C.

We show that prostasin enzymatic activity is inhibited by a soluble form of HAI-1B (sHAI-1B). The interaction of prostasin and HAI-1B in solution and in cell culture was also studied.

From this data base, each probe set on the microarray has a gene expression profile consisting of the expression results of each of the samples. The gene expression profile can be considered as a vector of expression values, one value for each sample. We limited our analysis to samples from epithelium-containing tissues labeled in the data base as normal and to those tissues that contained more than 20 normal samples. For each of these tissues, we performed a search starting with the gene expression profile for prostasin (Affymetrix probe set 202525_at), comparing it with the profiles for each of the other probe sets. The comparison of a given probe set with that of prostasin can be visualized as a scatter plot, with the expression value of prostasin on the x axis and the expression value of the given probe set on the y axis, and each sample from the given tissue represented by a point in the scatter plot. From this scatter plot, the co-expression of the given probe set with prostasin can be measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient r. High values of r indicate probe sets with a gene expression profile similar to the starting probe set (31Graeber T.G. Eisenberg D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We sorted all probe sets by their value of r and then filtered these lists to identify protease inhibitors that had high correlation coefficients.

Siani-Rose M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) for those annotated as belonging to a gene ontology molecular function of protease inhibitor activity (GO identification 0030414) or one of its subtypes (0042031, 0030415, 0004866, 0019828, 0004869, 0030161, 0008191, 0004867, 0030569, 0030568, 0030304) (www.geneontology.org). This search yielded 177 Affymetrix probe sets on the HG-U133A and HG-U133B microarrays.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs from various human tissues were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). RNA from OVCAR3 cells was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). These total RNAs were processed by using oligo(dT)24 and SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cDNAs and template controls were subjected to PCR using the primer set of prostasin, HAI-1, HAI-1B, or β-actin (as a control). The sequences of these primers were as follows: 5′-CCTGGGGCCTGGGCAGC-3′ and 5′-TGCGGCTCCTCAGGCTTGG-3′ for prostasin; 5′-ATGGAGGCTGCTTGGGCAACA-3′ and 5′-ACAGGCAGCCTCGTCGGAGG-3′ for HAI-1 and HAI-1B; 5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′ and 5′-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3′ for β-actin. The PCR amplifications were carried out for 25 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C (for HAI-1 and HAI-1B), or 65 °C (for prostasin) and 1 min at 72 °C using Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase mix (BD Biosciences-Clontech). The reverse transcription-PCR products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Prostasin—Full-length human prostasin cloned from a human cDNA library was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pRK5E. Recombinant protein was produced using a transient transfection process in CHO cells. Briefly, the cells were transfected with DNA·cationic lipid complex preformed for 15 min in basal medium and were then grown in 3-liter spinner flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mg/liter recombinant human insulin and trace elements. The culture was maintained at 33 °C for 5 days. The conditioned medium was harvested and loaded onto an aprotinin-agarose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After washing with the same buffer, prostasin was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. The eluates were neutralized by 0.5 m Tris immediately. Pooled prostasin fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis gave a sequence of 13ITGGSSAVAGQW24, indicating that purified prostasin was in the active two-chain form. Protein concentration was determined by use of the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).Generation of Antibodies—To obtain polyclonal antibodies against sHAI-1B or prostasin, 0.3 mg of recombinant protein was injected into each rabbit (Antibody Solutions, Palo Alto, CA). After 9–11 weeks, the rabbit sera with the highest titers were pooled and antibodies purified by protein A affinity chromatography. Mouse monoclonal antibody 6E9 against sHAI-1B was generated using standard hybridoma-producing techniques (33Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12583) Google Scholar). Hybridoma cell lines secreting antibody specific for sHAI-1B, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were cloned twice by limiting dilution and further characterized. The monoclonal antibody was then purified from ascites fluid by protein A affinity chromatography. The polyclonal and monoclonal anti-HAI-1B antibodies reacted with both HAI-1 and HAI-1B (data not shown).Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). After blocking the nonspecific binding sites with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody followed by incubation with 1:40,000 dilution of a goat anti-mouse or a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), which was detected by use of the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were as follows: polyclonal anti-HAI-1B antibody (4 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-HAI-1B antibody (3 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-prostasin antibody (1:500, BD Biosciences).Prostasin Binding Assay—Purified prostasin and sHAI-1B were diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (TT buffer) to the final concentration as indicated. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 or 2 h and SDS sample buffer with dithiothreitol was added. Some of the samples were boiled for 5 min as indicated in Fig. 2. 30 μl of each sample was analyzed by immunoblotting.Enzyme Inhibition Assay—Inhibitors were incubated with prostasin (final concentration, 3 nm) in 225 μl of TT buffer for 20 min at room temperature before the addition of 25 μl of 0.5 mm S2765 (final concentration, 0.05 mm; Km, 0.05 mm). The increase in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored on a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The linear rates of the increase in absorbance were expressed as percentage activities (100% × vi/v0). Inhibitor activity was calculated as the concentration of inhibitor giving 50% inhibition (IC50) of the uninhibited enzyme activity. At least three independent experiments were performed for each inhibitor.Transfection of CHO Cell Lines—Full-length HAI-1B was cloned by PCR as described previously (13Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C. Kadkhodayan S. Elliott J.M. Corpuz R.T. Lazarus R.A. Moran P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and inserted into the expression vector pRK5E. HAI-1B, or vector alone was transferred into CHO cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An HAI-1B-expressing clone was selected by immunoblotting the cell membrane. HAI-1B, and vector stably transfected CHO cell lines were designated CHO/HAI-1B and CHO/vector, respectively.HAI-1B Ectodomain Shedding Assay—CHO/HAI-1B and CHO/vector cells were grown to 50% confluence in DMEM plus 10% serum in 6-well plates. Cells were washed with PBS and grown to 90% confluence in serum-free medium supplemented with 2 mg/liter recombinant human insulin and trace elements. Then 1 ml of fresh serum-free medium containing 200 ng/ml prostasin or buffer (controls) was added. After continued incubation for 2 or 24 h, 300 μl of medium was collected and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min on a desktop microtube centrifuge. The supernatant was mixed with sample buffer containing dithiothreitol and then concentrated by a Microcon® centrifugal filter device (YM-10) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to 30 μl. Samples were boiled and analyzed by immunoblotting. To prepare cell lysates, cells were incubated for 24 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with 300 μl of M-PER™ lysis buffer (Pierce)/well for 5 min at room temperature. Then the cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 10 μl of supernatant was used for immunoblotting analysis.Isolation and Detection of the prostasin·HAI-1/1B Complexes from Cell Culture—CHO/HAI-1B and CHO/vector cells were grown as described for the HAI-1B ectodomain shedding assay, except that they were grown in 10-cm dishes. When cells reached 90% confluence, 3 ml of fresh serum-free medium with or without 200 ng/ml prostasin was added. After 2 h, the medium was harvested, and the cells were washed and lysed with 1 ml of M-PER™ lysis buffer.The transient transfection of CHO/HAI-1B and CHO/vector cells by pRK5E vector bearing full-length prostasin was performed in 10-cm dishes using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). When cells reached 70% confluence, 3 ml of fresh serum-free medium was added. The medium was collected after 48 h. The cells were washed and removed by trypsin treatment (0.25% with 1 mm EDTA). Cell membranes were prepared by resuspending the cells in 1 ml of cold Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Cells were homogenized with a Duall homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the pellet was resuspended with 300 μl of M-PER™ lysis buffer (Pierce) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Insoluble fractions were removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fractions contained membrane extracts.OVCAR3 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 250 ml DMEM plus 10% serum in a 2-liter roller bottle. All of the 250-ml medium was used in the purification of the complexes.Antibodies were immobilized to Aminolink® Plus Coupling Gel (Pierce) according to manufacturer's protocol. The coupling efficiency was determined by measuring the protein concentration of the starting material and the non-bound fraction. The amount of coupled antibody ranged from 1.4 to 2.3 mg/ml resin. Prostasin·HAI-1B complexes were purified by incubation of medium or cell extract with antibody-coupled resin (containing 100 μg of antibody) at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation overnight. The resin was then washed with PBS and the bound proteins eluted with 60 μl ImmunoPure® IgG elution buffer (Pierce). For isolation of the complexes from OVCAR3 cell culture, the cell medium was loaded onto a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) pre-packed with the antibody-coupled resin (containing 350 μg of antibody 6E9) at room temperature. The resin was then washed with PBS and the bound proteins eluted with 500 μl of ImmunoPure® IgG elution buffer. SDS sample buffer with dithiothreitol was added to the eluates and boiled for 5 min before each sample was analyzed by immunoblotting.RESULTSExpression Profiles of Prostasin and HAI-1/1B—We undertook a co-expression search to find prostasin inhibitors on the assumption that natural inhibitors may have gene expression patterns similar to those of their target enzymes. The 177 probe sets used represented 111 different inhibitors of all major protease inhibitor families. Data analysis revealed HAI-1 (represented by Affymetrix probe set 202826_at) as a high ranking protease inhibitor in normal tissues (TABLE ONE). HAI-1 ranked highest in 7 and second highest in 6 of the 17 examined tissues. The p values for these tissues were all statistically significant (p < 0.005). In cases where HAI-1 was not the highest ranking protease inhibitor, the table shows the protease inhibitor that did rank highest. In three cases where HAI-1 ranked second (cervix, endometrium, and esophagus), the highest ranking protease inhibitor was HAI-2, a bi-Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor structurally related to HAI-1.TABLE ONERanking of HAI-1 in co-expression analysis of prostasin Organ NsampleaNumber of samples in the database.

https://openalex.org/W1973469290,"The scaffolding protein IQGAP1 participates in numerous cellular functions by binding to target proteins such as actin, calmodulin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, Cdc42, Rac1, and CLIP-170. IQGAP1 regulates the cytoskeleton, promotes cell motility, and modulates E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. However, how IQGAP1 exerts its functions in vivo is still unclear. In this study we investigate the self-association of IQGAP1 and its role in IQGAP1 function. Endogenous IQGAP1 co-immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cells with IQGAP1 tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein, indicating that IQGAP1 self-associates in cells. In vitro assays confirmed that IQGAP1 can self-associate and that this effect is mediated by the N-terminal half of the protein. Gel filtration analysis suggested that full-length IQGAP1 exists as a combination of monomers, dimers, and larger oligomers. Analysis performed with multiple fragments of IQGAP1 narrowed the self-association region to amino acids 763–863. In support of this observation, a peptide comprising residues 763–863 disrupted self-association of full-length IQGAP1 in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, deleting this sequence from IQGAP1 abolished binding to full-length IQGAP1. In addition, the ability of IQGAP1 to increase the amount of active Cdc42 in cells is abrogated upon removal of this region. Consistent with these findings, transfection into cells of a peptide containing the self-association domain significantly reduced the amount of active Cdc42 in cell lysates. These observations define a sequence of IQGAP1 that is necessary for its oligomerization and demonstrate that self-association is required for the normal cellular function of IQGAP1.

Through interactions with these and other proteins, IQGAP1 participates in multiple fundamental cellular activities, including transcription, cell-cell attachment, and regulation of the cytoskeleton (2Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although it is involved in many important activities, how IQGAP1 exerts its function in vivo is unclear. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis first proposed by Ho et al. (5Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) that IQGAP1 functions as a scaffold. Proteins in biological systems rarely act in isolation but bind other biomolecules to elicit specific cellular responses. The self-association of proteins to form dimers and higher oligomers is a very common phenomenon (for a review see Ref. 14Marianayagam N.J. Sunde M. Matthews J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Recent structural and biophysical studies show that dimerization or oligomerization is a key factor in the regulation of proteins such as enzymes, ion channels, receptors, and transcription factors (14Marianayagam N.J. Sunde M. Matthews J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). There is some indirect evidence implying that IQGAP1 self-associates. For example, sedimentation equilibrium of IQGAP1 obtained from bovine adrenal tissue suggested an estimated molecular weight of 358,653 to 401,864 (15Bashour A.M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another study inferred from gel filtration analysis that IQGAP1 may form oligomers (16Fukata M. Kuroda S. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29579-29583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, no data have been published to unequivocally document that IQGAP1 can self-associate. Moreover, although it is commonly stated that IQGAP1 dimerizes via multiple putative coiled-coil repeats in the N-terminal half of the molecule (4Mateer S.C. Wang N. Bloom G.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 55: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Mateer S.C. McDaniel A.E. Nicolas V. Habermacher G.M. Lin M.J. Cromer D.A. King M.E. Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12324-12333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), direct evidence to bolster this claim is lacking. For these reasons, we set out in this study to establish whether IQGAP1 self-associates and, if so, which region is responsible. Our data reveal that IQGAP1 self-associates both in vitro and in cells. Most unexpectedly, the oligomerization site was not via the coiled-coil repeats, but localized to amino acids 763–863. Deletion of this sequence disrupted self-association of IQGAP1. Moreover, a mutant IQGAP1 construct lacking this sequence failed to increase active Cdc42 in the cells, suggesting that oligomerization is important for IQGAP1 function.

To create a PacI site, the pBluescript-KS– plasmid was digested with SspI, and then a short linker containing a PacI site was inserted. This plasmid, named pBluescript-KS–-P, was cut with PacI and ClaI, and a PacI-ClaI fragment from pcDNA3-IQGAP1 was inserted. The resultant plasmid was named pBluescript-IQ. pBluescript-IQGAP1-(Δ746–860) was created by PCR-directed deletion mutagenesis using pBluescript-IQ as a template and Pfx polymerase. Phosphorylated primers complementary to bp 2682–2702 (antisense, 5′-ATTGGCCAGCCACAGCTGTTC-3′) and bp 3048–3069 (sense, 5′-GCTGAGGATCCTCCTATGGTTG-3′) of IQGAP1 were used for amplification, and the resultant PCR product was gel-purified and self-ligated, producing pBluescript-IQGAP1-(Δ746–860). A PacI-ClaI fragment from pBluescript-IQGAP1-(Δ746–860) was inserted into pcDNA-IQGAP1 cut with PacI and ClaI to generate pcDNA3-IQGAP1-(Δ746–860). Full-length IQGAP1 was tagged at the N terminus with tandem enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by digesting pcDNA3-IQGAP1 with XbaI. After making a blunt end with T4 DNA polymerase, partial digestion was performed with BamHI to give a 5577-bp fragment. This fragment was inserted into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) at a BglII and SmalI site, producing the plasmid pEGFP-IQGAP1. To enhance fluorescence, a second EGFP was added. pEGFP-IQGAP1 was digested with NheI and PacI to give a 2380-bp fragment. The NheI cleavage site was filled with T4 DNA polymerase. The 2380-bp fragment was then inserted into pEGFP-IQGAP1 at a BsrGI-PacI site, in which BsrGI cleavage was also filled with T4 DNA polymerase, producing pEGFP-EGFP-IQGAP1 (named pEGFP2-IQGAP1). Peptides comprising selected regions of IQGAP1 were produced by PCR. To generate Myc-IQGAP1-(763–964) (the numbers indicate the amino acid residues of IQGAP1 that are included), PCR was performed on full-length IQGAP1 using primers flanking nucleotides 2754 and 3359. The forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCCAGGAATTCCGATCCAGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGATCACTCCTTGCTCAAAGCCTTG-3′ were designed to generate a 606-bp DNA product containing a BamHI site at the 5′ end and a stop codon and a XbaI site at the 3′ end. Digestion with BamHI and XbaI generated a fragment that was subcloned into the BamHI-XbaI site of pcDNA3-myc yielding a plasmid containing the cDNA for the 202-amino acid residues of IQGAP1 fused in-frame at its N terminus to a Myc epitope tag. A similar cloning strategy was employed to construct myc-IQGAP1-(216–683) (containing amino acids 216–683), myc-IQGAP1-(717–916) (containing amino acids 717–916), myc-IQGAP1-(763–863) (containing amino acids 763–863), and myc-IQGAP1-(864–964) using primers flanking nucleotides 1111 and 2514, 2614 and 3213, 2752 and 3054, and 3055 and 3357, of IQGAP1 respectively. The forward primers 5′-CGGGATCCGCATTCATGCTGCTGTTATTGC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTCTATGCAGCTTTCTCGGGAGG-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCCAGGAATTCCGATCCAGG-3′, and 5′-CGGGATCCCCTCCTATGGTTGTGGTCCG-3′ and the reverse primers 5′-GCTCTAGACCCGGGTCAGCTGTTATTATCTCCTACTGCC-3′, 5′-GCTCTAGACCCGGGTCATTTGATATCCATGAGATTGATT-3′,5′-GCTCTAGATCAATCCTCAGCATTGATGAGAG-3′, and 5′-GCTCTAGATCACTCCTTGCTCAAAGCCTTG-3′ were used to generate the IQGAP1-(216–683), IQGAP1-(717–916), IQGAP1-(763–863), and IQGAP1-(864–964), respectively. Each reverse primer included a stop codon directly following the codon corresponding to the last amino acid of the appropriate IQGAP1 sequence. For the construction of IQGAP1-(2–746), PCR was performed on full-length IQGAP1 using forward primer 5′-GCTGGCTACCCTGCAGCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGATCAATTGGCCAGCCACAGCTGTTC-3′ flanking nucleotides 1763 and 2702, which contains a PacI site. The reverse primer has an XbaI site at the 3′ end. PCR products were digested with PacI and XbaI, and the resultant fragment were inserted into pcDNA3-IQGAP1 cut with PacI-XbaI. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by both restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. All peptides are Myc-tagged. Plasmids were purified with a QIAprep Spin miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Fusion Proteins—The construction of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IQGAP1, GST-IQGAP1-N (N-terminal half, amino acids 2–863), GST-IQGAP1-C (C-terminal half, amino acids 864–1657), and GST-WASP-GBD has been described previously (5Ho Y.D.

A linker containing the TEV protease recognition site (TEV1, 5′-GAAGATCTGATTACGATATCCCAACGACCGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCGCCGGATCCCG-3′, and TEV2, 5′-CGGGATCCGGCGCCCTGAAAATACAGGTTTTCGGTCGTTGGGATATCGTAATCAGATCTTC-3′) was inserted into pGEX4T1 to generate pGEX4T1-TEV. pcDNA3-IQGAP1 was digested with XbaI, and a blunt end was made with T4 DNA polymerase. Following partial digestion with BamHI, the resulting fragment of IQGAP1 was inserted into pGEX4T1-TEV, which had been digested with BamHI-SmaI. The resultant pEGX4T1-TEV-IQGAP1 was digested with PvuI, and the fragment obtained was inserted into pACYC184 (which had been digested by AvaI-HindIII) to generate the pACYC184-TEV-IQGAP1 plasmid. (Note that both the PvuI and HindIII sites were made into a blunt end with T4 DNA polymerase.) To obtain GST-IQGAP1-(216–683), PCR was performed on full-length IQGAP1 using the forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCGCATTACATGCTGCTGTTATTGC-3′ (which included a BamHI site) and the reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGACCCGGGTCAGCTGTTATTATCTCCTACTGCC-3′ (an XmaI site and a stop codon were included) flanking nucleotides 1111 and 2514 of IQGAP1. The resulting 1404-bp product was gel-purified, cut with BamHI and XmaI, and subcloned into the BamHI-XmaI site of pGEX-2T. A similar method was used to construct GST-IQGAP1-(717–916), using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCTATGCAGCTTTCTCGGGAGG-3′ (forward, BamHI site included) and 5′-GCTCTAGACCCGGGTCATTTGATATCCATGAGATTGATT-3′ (reverse, XmaI site and a stop codon included). To obtain His-IQGAP1-(763–863), PCR was performed on full-length IQGAP1 using primers 5′-CGGGATCCCAGGAATTCCGATCCAGG-3′ (forward, BamHI site included) and 5′-GCTCTAGATCAATCCTCAGCATTGATGAGAG-3′ (reverse, XbaI site and a stop codon included) flanking nucleotides 2752 and 3054. The resulting product was gel-purified and cut with XbaI. After making a blunt end with T4 DNA polymerase, the resultant product was cut with BamHI to give a 303-bp fragment. The product was subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pRSET A containing a His tag, in which EcoRI cleavage was also filled with T4 DNA polymerase, producing pRSET-His-IQGAP1-(763–863). Similar strategy was taken to construct His-IQGAP1-(717–916). Briefly, PCR was performed on full-length IQGAP1 flanking nucleotides 2614 and 3213 using primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCTATGCAGCTTTCTCGGGAGG-3′ (forward, BamHI site included) and 5′-GCTCTAGACCCGGGTCATTTGATATCCATGAGATTGATT-3′ (reverse, SmaI site and a stop codon were included). The resulting 600-bp products were gel-purified and cut with BamHI and SmaI. The product were subcloned into the BamHI-SmaI site of pRSET A containing a His tag, in which EcoRI cleavage was also filled with T4 DNA polymerase producing pRSET-His-IQGAP1-(717–916). pRSET-His-IQGAP1-(763–863) and pRSET-His-IQGAP1-(717–916) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and isolated with glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (5Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (7Roy M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, subconfluent MCF-7 cells were transfected with pEGFP2-IQGAP1, IQGAP1-N, or IQGAP1-C. Twenty four hours later, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in buffer A containing PMSF and a protease inhibitor mixture, and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the debris. Supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. Anti-IQGAP1 or anti-GFP antibodies were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C, washed four times with buffer A, and incubated for 3 h with equal amounts of precleared protein lysate. Complexes were sedimented by centrifugation, washed five times with buffer A, and heated for 5 min at 100 °C in solubilization buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF, and blots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 monoclonal antibody (which recognizes the C-terminal half of IQGAP1), anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibody (which recognizes the N-terminal half of IQGAP1), anti-Myc, or anti-GFP antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with the appropriate (rabbit or mouse) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by ECL. TnT Product Production—[35S]Methionine-labeled TnT products were produced with the TnT Quick-Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of IQGAP1, IQGAP1ΔCHD, IQGAP1ΔWW, IQGAP1-(Δ746–860), IQGAP1ΔGRD, IQGAP1ΔC, IQGAP1-N, IQGAP1-C, IQGAP1-N1, IQGAP1-N2, IQGAP1-(216–683), IQGAP1-(763–964), IQGAP1-(763–863), IQGAP1-(864–964), or IQGAP1-(717–916) was incubated with 40 μl of TnT Quick master mix (Promega) and 2 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 90 min. Products were identified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In Vitro Binding Assays—Equal amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled IQGAP1 constructs described in the previous paragraph were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with GST-IQGAP1, GST-IQGAP1-N, GST-IQGAP1-(216–683), GST-IQGAP1-(717–916), His-IQGAP1-(763–863), or His-IQGAP1-(717–916) in 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitors mixture. After centrifugation, samples were washed six times with buffer A and resolved by SDS-PAGE. TnT products were detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. For the competition assays, [35S]methionine-labeled IQGAP1-(763–863) or IQGAP1-(717–916) was preincubated with GST-IQGAP1 for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer A containing PMSF and protease inhibitors, and then equal amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled full-length IQGAP1 was added. After a 2-h incubation, samples were washed six times with buffer A, resolved by SDS-PAGE or Tricine/SDS-PAGE, and followed by autoradiography. Gel Filtration Chromatography—GST-IQGAP1 (containing the TEV protease recognition site) was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with 5 μl of TEV protease at 4 °C for 16 h. The GST was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation was performed on an ΔKTA™FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a UPC-900 monitor and a P-920 pump. The system was monitored and controlled by methods run by the UNICORN control system (5.01 version). A Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) was pre-equilibrated with 4-column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (equilibration buffer). After loading the sample (30 μg of IQGAP1 in 500 μl of equilibration buffer containing 1% Triton X-100) onto the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, the equilibration buffer was passed through the column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. An aliquot (450 μl) of each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, solubilized, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The column was calibrated using blue dextran (2,000 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa) as standards. IQGAP1 was also chromatographed on a TosoHaas (Montgomeryville, PA) G4000SW (600 × 7.5 mm inner diameter) column operated at 0.5 ml/min with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. Fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals and analyzed as described above. Measurement of Activated Cdc42—Active Cdc42 was measured with a GST fusion construct of the GTPase-binding domain (GBD) of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) as described previously (20Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The GST-WASP-GBD binds only GTP-Cdc42 (20Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transfected with selected constructs (indicated in the legend to Fig. 11), followed by lysis with buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2) containing 20 μm GTP and protease inhibitor mixture. Equal amounts of protein lysate, precleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads, were incubated with 40 μg of GST-WASP-GBD for 2 h at 4°C. Complexes were collected with glutathione-Sepharose, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resultant Western blots were probed with anti-Cdc42 antibody. Equal amounts of protein lysate were also subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blots were probed with anti-β-tubulin, anti-IQGAP1, and anti-Myc antibodies. Miscellaneous—Protein assays were performed using the DC protein assay from Bio-Rad. Densitometry of ECL signals were analyzed with Un-scan-it software (Silk Scientific Corp.) Statistical analysis was assessed by Student's t test with Excel (Micro software). IQGAP1 Self-Associates in Cells—Co-immunoprecipitation was used to investigate whether IQGAP1 self-associates in cells. IQGAP1, tagged at its N terminus with two molecules of EGFP (termed EGFP2-IQGAP1), was transfected into MCF-7 cells. Examination of the lysate demonstrated expression of transfected EGFP2-IQGAP1, which migrates to the expected position on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lane 2, top band). To evaluate self-association, cells transfected with EGFP2-IQGAP1 were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Probing the resultant immunoblots with anti-IQGAP1 antibody revealed that endogenous IQGAP1 co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP2-IQGAP1 (Fig. 1A, bottom band, lane 4). Note that two bands of EGFP-tagged IQGAP1 are visible in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A, lane 4). This is most likely caused by the removal of one molecule of EGFP from the dual EGFP-tagged IQGAP1 during the immunoprec"
https://openalex.org/W2139666973,"NAP1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1) is a histone chaperone that has been described to bind predominantly to the histone H2A·H2B dimer in the cell during shuttling of histones into the nucleus, nucleosome assembly/remodeling, and transcription. Here it was examined how NAP1 interacts with chromatin fibers isolated from HeLa cells. NAP1 induced a reversible change toward an extended fiber conformation as demonstrated by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation experiments. This transition was due to the removal of the linker histone H1. The H2A·H2B dimer remained stably bound to the native fiber fragments and to fibers devoid of linker histone H1. This was in contrast to mononucleosome substrates, which displayed a NAP1-induced removal of a single H2A·H2B dimer from the core particle. The effect of NAP1 on the chromatin fiber structure was examined by scanning/atomic force microscopy. A quantitative image analysis of ∼36,000 nucleosomes revealed an increase of the average internucleosomal distance from 22.3 ± 0.4 to 27.6 ± 0.6 nm, whereas the overall fiber structure was preserved. This change reflects the disintegration of the chromatosome due to binding of H1 to NAP1 as chromatin fibers stripped from H1 showed an average nucleosome distance of 27.4 ± 0.8 nm. The findings suggest a possible role of NAP1 in chromatin remodeling processes involved in transcription and replication by modulating the local linker histone content."
https://openalex.org/W2073904778,"R(+)WIN 55,212-2 is a synthetic cannabinoid that controls disease progression in models of multiple sclerosis. This is associated with its ability to reduce migration of leukocytes into the central nervous system. Because leukocyte migration is dependent on induction of adhesion molecules and chemokines by pro-inflammatory cytokines, we examined the effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 on their expression. Using 1321N1 astrocytoma and A-172 glioblastoma as cell models we show that R(+)WIN 55,212-2, but not its inactive chiral form S(–)WIN 55,212-2, strongly inhibits the interleukin-1 (IL-1) induction of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and the chemokine IL-8. This inhibition is not mediated via the CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptors, because their selective antagonists and pertussis toxin failed to affect the inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2. Furthermore reverse transcription-PCR analysis did not detect the expression of either receptor in 1321N1 cells. R(+)WIN 55,212-2 was shown to inhibit adhesion molecule and chemokine expression at the level of transcription, because it strongly inhibited the IL-1 induction of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and IL-8 mRNAs and blocked the IL-1 activation of their promoters. The NFκB pathway was then assessed as a lead target for R(+)WIN 55,212-2. NFκB was measured by expression of a transfected NFκB-regulated reporter gene. Using this assay, R(+)WIN 55,212-2 strongly inhibited IL-1 activation of NFκB. Furthermore R(+)WIN 55,212-2 inhibited the ability of overexpressed Myd88, Tak-1, and IKK-2 to induce the reporter gene suggesting that R(+)WIN 55,212-2 acts at or downstream of IKK-2 in the IL-1 pathway. However R(+)WIN 55,212-2 failed to inhibit IL-1-induced degradation of IκBα, excluding IKK-2 as a direct target. In addition electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that R(+)WIN 55,212-2 does not regulate the IL-1-induced nuclear translocation of NFκB or the ability of the latter to bind to promoters regulating expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8.

These studies described antiinflammatory activity of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 in the brain and its ability to inhibit leukocyte entry into the CNS. This is likely to be a key component underlying the therapeutic effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2, because multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory-based disease characterized by a strong infiltration of the CNS by leukocytes (7Hafler D.A.

However, the molecular basis to the effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 was not addressed and the potential roles of the two Gi-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) (8Slipetz D.M. O'Neill G.P.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 2113-2119PubMed Google Scholar). NFκB is a key driver in the induction processes, and IL-1 is a potent activator of this transcription factor in astrocytes (15Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bourke E. Kennedy E.J. Moynagh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39996-40002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of NFκB is tightly regulated by its association with the inhibitory IκB that sequesters NFκB in the cytosol. IL-1 causes phosphorylation of IκB proteins by the IκB-kinases (IKKs), IKK-1 and IKK-2, and this leads to IκB degradation. This allows for translocation of NFκB to the nucleus, where it activates genes encoding inflammatory proteins, including adhesion molecules. One of the most active subunits of NFκB is p65, and the transactivation potential of this subunit may be enhanced by phosphorylation at serine residues 276, 529, and 536 (20Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates that R(+)WIN 55,212-2 inhibits the IL-1 induction of adhesion molecules, and IL-8 in astrocytes in a manner independent of CB1 and CB2 receptors. We also show that the likely mechanism is inhibition of the IL-1-induced transactivation of NFκB without affecting the degradation of IκB or the nuclear translocation or DNA binding of NFκB. This increases our molecular understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids in the CNS.

Cell Culture—1321N1 astrocytoma and A-172 glioblastoma were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The cells were passaged using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin in PBS. IL-1β stimulation was performed on cells in serum-containing medium at 37 °C for all experiments. Human BJAB cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Detection of Cell Adhesion Molecules and IL-8—1321N1 astrocytoma and A-172 glioblastoma (4 × 104 cells/0.2 ml) were plated into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to grow for 48 and 24 h, respectively. Cells were pre-treated for designated times with indicated concentrations of R(+)WIN 55,212-2, S(–)WIN 55,212-2, SR141716A, SR144528, or pertussis toxin prior to IL-1β (10 ng/ml) treatment for an additional 24 h. Stimulation was terminated by removal of medium, which was subsequently assayed for IL-8 using matched antibody pairs (R & D Systems Europe Ltd., Abingdon, Oxford, UK) in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system according to the supplier's instruction. The adherent cells were measured for expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 as described previously (15Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis of Adhesion Molecule and IL-8 Expression—1321N1 astrocytoma (2 × 105 cells/ml) were plated into 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were pre-treated for 1 h with R(+)WIN 55,212-2 (20 μm) prior to IL-1β (10 ng/ml) treatment for an additional 23 h. Cells were washed once with PBS, and RNA was extracted using Tri reagent (Sigma). After DNase I digestion, cDNA was generated from normalized RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Samples were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR for levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-8 cDNA using the ABI Prism 7900HT thermal cycler. Reactions were performed using pre-validated primers and probes (Applied Biosystems). Assessment of Cytotoxicity Using the CytoTox 96 Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay—The effect of R(+)-WIN 55,212-2 on 1321N1 cell viability was assessed by use of the CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega Corp.). This spectrophotometric method is based on the quantitative measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell lysis, by a coupled enzymatic assay. 1321N1 astrocytoma (4 × 104 cells/0.2 ml) were plated into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to grow for 48 h. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 as above. The cell medium was removed and assayed for LDH activity according to the manufacturer's instructions, and data were expressed relative to total LDH activity in the cells. The latter was measured in supernatants from untreated cells previously lysed in Triton X-100 (1% v/v). Assay of CB1 and CB2 mRNA Expression—Total cellular RNA was prepared from 1321N1 astrocytoma and BJAB cells (4 × 106 cells) using the RNA ISOLATOR according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and random oligonucleotide primers, and PCR amplification was performed using TaqDNA polymerase and primers to selectively amplify regions of the CB1, CB2, and GAPDH cDNAs. The sequences of the forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers and the sizes of the products were: CB1, 5′-GAGACAACCCCCAGCTAGTCCCAGCAGACC-3′ and 5′-TGGGCCTGGTGACAATCCTCTTATAGGCC-3′, 500 bp; CB2, 5′-CTTCTGGCCCTGCTAAGTGCCCTGGAGAACG-3′ and 5′-CAGCAAGTCCATCCCATGAGGGGCAGCTAGG-3′, 400 bp; and GAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTG-3′, 452 bp. Amplification parameters were as follows: step 1: 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, at 53 °C for 1 min and at 72 °C for 1 min; step 2: at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, containing ethidium bromide, and photographed. Cell Transfections—1321N1 astrocytoma (4 × 104 cells/0.2 ml) were plated into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were then transfected, using GeneJuice transfection reagent, with designated firefly luciferase reporter plasmids (80–100 ng), constitutively expressed Renilla-luciferase reporter construct (phRL-TK) (40 ng), and expression constructs encoding Myd88, Tak-1, or IKK-2 (80 ng). In control experiments lacking the latter expression constructs total DNA was kept constant (240 ng/well) using the pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Cells were allowed to recover overnight (17 h) and then pre-treated with or without R(+)WIN 55,212-2 or S(–)WIN 55,212-2 for 1 h prior to stimulation in the presence or absence of IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for a further 6 h. Cell extracts were generated using the Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and extracts were assayed for firefly luciferase and Renilla-luciferase activity using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) and coelenterazine (1 μg/ml), respectively. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Fractions—1321N1 cells (2 × 105 cells/ml; 3 ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to adhere for 72 h. Cells were pre-treated with or without various concentrations of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 or S(–)WIN 55,212-2 for 1 h prior to stimulation in the presence or absence of IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min. Stimulation was terminated by removal of medium, and cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min and then lysed for 10 min on ice in hypotonic buffer (20 μl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants constituted cytosolic fractions and were measured for levels of IκB by Western immunoblotting as described previously (19Bourke E. Kennedy E.J. Moynagh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39996-40002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.9 (15 μl), containing 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated for 15 min on ice. Incubations were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were removed into 10 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.9 (75 μl), containing 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Such samples constituted nuclear extracts and were assayed for NFκB by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were incubated with 30,000 dpm of a 22-bp oligonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus sequence, which previously had been labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (19Bourke E. Kennedy E.J. Moynagh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39996-40002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (w/v) glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. All incubations were subjected to electrophoresis on native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels that were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Analysis by Quantitative Realtime PCR—1321N1 astrocytoma cells were grown to confluency in 90-mm dishes. Cells were pre-treated with or without R(+)WIN 55,212-2 (20 μm) for 1 h prior to stimulation in the absence or presence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. ChIP assays were performed as previously described (21Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Following stimulation, cells were cross-linked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Isolated nuclei were subjected to seven 10-s sonication pulses from a Sanyo/MES Soniprep 150 at one-third of total power. Separate aliquots from each chromatin preparation were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-p65 antibody and rabbit IgG antibody. An aliquot was also retained as an input sample to normalize PCR reactions and analyze shearing efficiency. Chromatin used had an average size of 750 bp. After reversion of cross-links by overnight incubation at 65 °C, DNA was extracted using the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard PCR was performed using 1 μl (∼3% of total) of template DNA, 500 nm primers, and 0.2 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) per 50-μl reaction. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed in duplicate with 2 μl of template DNA, 50 nm primers, and the SYBR Green Jumpstart Taq Readymix (Sigma), using the Mx3000P QPCR System (Stratagene). Dissociation curve analysis and gel electrophoresis of the final products confirmed that only the expected specific amplicon of correct size was generated for each target promoter. Real-time PCR data analysis was performed as previously described (22Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Results for each treatment are expressed as -fold differences between DNA enrichment in the p65-ChIP sample relative to IgG-ChIP sample. The sequences of primers used are as follows: ICAM-1, 5′-CTCCACTCTCCGGGGAAGTTG-3′ and 5′-GCTGCAGTTATTTCCGGACTGAC-3′; IL-8, 5′-GGAAGTGTGATGACTCAGGTTTGC-3′ and 5′-GATGGTTCCTTCCGGTGGTTTCTTC-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-CTACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′. Western Blot Analysis of p65 Phosphorylation—1321N1 astrocytoma (2 × 105 cells/ml; 3 ml) were plated into 6-well plates and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were pre-treated with or without R(+)WIN 55,212-2 for 1 h prior to stimulation in the presence or absence of IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min. Stimulation was terminated by removal of medium, and the adherent cells washed with ice-cold PBS (3 ml). The cells were then scraped into PBS (1 ml) and pelleted by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The lysates were sonicated for 10 s to reduce sample viscosity and then heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Lysates (20 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide slab gels, and the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was then probed for levels of Ser536 phosphorylated using specific antibodies as recommended by the manufacturers. Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Because R(+)WIN 55,212-2 has been reported to inhibit the infiltration of leukocytes into the brain (9Ni X. Geller E.B. Eppihimer M.J. Eisenstein T.K. Adler M.W. Tuma R.F. Mult. Scler. 2004; 10: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we initially assessed the regulatory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 on the expression of the likely adhesion molecules and chemokines mediating this infiltration process. We have previously characterized the ability of IL-1 to induce the expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and the chemokine IL-8 in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (15Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bourke E. Moynagh P.N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2113-2119PubMed Google Scholar), and this was used as the model in the present study. R(+)WIN 55,212-2 was assessed for its ability to inhibit the IL-1 induction of adhesion molecules and IL-8 in this cell system (Fig. 1). R(+)WIN 55,212-2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the IL-1 induction of both ICAM-1 (Fig. 1a), VCAM-1 (Fig. 1b), and IL-8 (Fig. 1c) in 1321N1 astrocytoma. The dose-dependent inhibitory profiles were similar in all three cases. WIN 55,212-2 is available in two enantiomeric forms, R and S, with R being the active form (23Herzberg U. Eliav E. Bennett G.J. Kopin I.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 221: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast to the R form, the inactive chiral S(–)WIN 55,212-2 failed to affect the ability of IL-1 to induce ICAM-1 (Fig. 1a) and VCAM-1 (Fig. 1b) suggesting that a stereoselective mechanism underlies the inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2. To exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 were due indirectly to nonspecific cytotoxicity, the viability of the cells after treatment with the same concentration range of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 was assessed by measuring the release of LDH (Fig. 1d). None of the concentrations of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 caused any detrimental effects on cellular viability indicating that its inhibitory effects on VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression are not due to general toxicity. To ensure that the above effects are not simply artifacts of the 1321N1 astrocytoma cell line, the effect of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 on A-172 glioblastoma, another cell of glia origin, was next examined. Like 1321N1 astrocytoma, A-172 cells showed increased expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 (Fig. 2a) and the chemokine IL-8 (Fig. 2b) in response to IL-1. The pre-treatment of A-172 cells with R(+)WIN 55,212-2 caused a complete blockade of the IL-1 induction of ICAM-1 (Fig. 2a) and IL-8 (Fig. 2b) thus validating the previous findings from 1321N1 astrocytoma. The involvement of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in mediating the inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 was next explored by assessing the ability of the CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists, SR141716A and SR144528, respectively, to regulate the inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 in 1321N1 cells. SR141716A had no influence on the IL-1 induction of ICAM-1 but more importantly failed to affect the strong inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 on the induction process (Fig. 3a). Similar results were obtained with respect to VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 3b). This indicates a lack of involvement of the CB1 receptor in mediating the inhibitory effects. The role of the CB2 receptor was next examined by assessing the regulatory effects of SR144528 on R(+)WIN 55,212-2. However, like the CB1 receptor antagonist, SR144528 failed to regulate the strong inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 on IL-1 induction of ICAM-1 (Fig. 3c) or VCAM-1 (Fig. 3d) in 1321N1 cells and thus tended to exclude a role for the CB2 receptor in mediating the effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2. Because both CB1 and CB2 receptors signal via a Gi protein, and the latter is subject to inhibition by pertussis toxin, the roles of CB1 and CB2 receptors were further probed by investigating the regulation of the effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 by this toxin. However the inability of pertussis toxin to modulate the inhibitory effects of R(+)WIN 55,212-2 on IL-1 induction of ICAM-1 (Fig. 4a) or VCAM-1 (Fig. 4b) further confirms the lack of involvement of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in mediating the responses to R(+)WIN 55,212-2. The above findings prompted an analysis of the expression levels of the two receptors in 1321N1 astrocytoma. The highly sensitive approach of RT-PCR was exploited to amplify the CB1 and CB2 receptors by using primers that specifically amplify regions of the CB1 or CB2 receptor cDNAs. The BJAB cell line was also probed for expression of both receptor subtypes and acted as a positive control for the primers and RT-PCR procedure, since it has previously been shown that B cells express high levels of cannabinoid receptors (24Galiegue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D. Carriere D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Indeed the RT-PCR analysis in the present study resulted in the generation of products with the predicted sizes of 500 bp (CB1) and 400 bp (CB2) in BJAB cells (Fig. 5a) demonstrating that these cells express both CB1 and CB2. In addition the generation of these products validates the primers and PCR conditions as a suitable detection system for the expression of both receptors. Intriguingly, the equivalent RT-PCR analysis of RNA from 1321N1 astrocytoma failed to generate any such products indicating that these cells do not express the CB1 and CB2 receptors (Fig. 5a). To confirm the RNA from 1321N1 cells as a suitable"
https://openalex.org/W1996492588,"IκB kinases (IKKs), IKKα and IKKβ, with a regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO constitute a high molecular weight IKK complex that regulates NF-κB activity. Although IKKα and IKKβ share structural and biochemical similarities, IKKα has been shown to have distinct biological roles. Here we show that IKKα plays a critical role in regulating cyclin D1 during the cell cycle. Analysis of IKKα-/- mouse embryo fibroblast cells showed that cyclin D1 is overexpressed and localized in the nucleus compared with parental mouse embryo fibroblasts. IKKα associates with and phosphorylates cyclin D1. Analysis on cyclin D1 mutants demonstrated that IKKα phosphorylates cyclin D1 at Thr286. Reconstitution of IKKα in knockout cells leads to nuclear export and increased degradation of cyclin D1. Further, RNAi-mediated knockdown of IKKα results in similar changes as observed in IKKα-/- cells. These results suggest a novel role of IKKα in regulating subcellular localization and proteolysis of cyclin D1 by phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr286, the same residue earlier found to be a target for glycogen synthase kinase-3β-induced phosphorylation.

NF-κB transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm in association with the inhibitory protein called IκB. The IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, which leads to its ubiquitination, followed by proteosomal degradation. The released NF-κB transcription factors are transported to the nucleus and activate or repress expression of genes involved in a variety of biological activity including inflammation, immune response, cell growth, and apoptosis. The IKK complex includes the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

IKKβ is the major kinase for NF-κB activation in canonical pathway, and the role of IKKα is considered redundant in this process. Analysis of IKKα knockout mice reveals a distinctive phenotype, including severe defects of skin and limb development, and IKKα has been shown to be involved in the development of the epidermis (13Hu Y.

Recently, IKKα was shown to regulate cytokine-inducible gene expression through its association with NF-κB-regulated promoters and histone H3 phosphorylation (21Yamamoto Y. Kim D.W. Kwak Y.T.

Cyclin D with its partner cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK4 and CDK6, phosphorylate their downstream target, the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb). pRb phosphorylation releases the E2F family of transcription factors that activate the expression of cyclin E and multiple other genes required for the cell cycle progression (3Stevaux O.

Association of cyclin E with CDK2 leads to further phosphorylation of pRb, thus providing a positive feedback loop for progression of the cell cycle beyond the G1/S checkpoint. Different mitogenic pathways, including Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, induce expression of cyclin D, whereas negative regulators of the cell cycle cause phosphorylation of cyclin D by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β with subsequent ubiquitination and degradation (31Diehl J.A.

Disordered epidermal cell proliferation in IKKα-/- mice also suggested a role of IKKα in cellular proliferation (14Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 15Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate the role of IKKα in cell cycle regulation. Subcellular distribution of cyclin D1 is cell cycle-specific. Newly synthesized cyclin D1 in association with CDK4/CDK6 is transported to the nucleus to induce pRb phosphorylation. During the S phase, cyclin D1 becomes exclusively cytoplasmic. Nuclear export of cyclin D1, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteolysis are dependent on GSK-3β-induced phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at the Thr286 residue. We found that in IKKα-/- cells, cyclin D1 was localized in the nucleus and was more stable than that in parental MEF cells. Reconstitution of IKKα-/- cells with IKKα restores these defects found in IKKα-/- cells. Further, we demonstrate that IKKα associates with cyclin D1 and phosphorylates it at Thr286. Thus in addition to the earlier demonstrated role of IKKα in transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1, our data indicate that IKKα regulates cyclin D1 at the post-transcriptional level as well. It induces phosphorylation of cyclin D1, leading to the nuclear export and subsequent proteolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—Wild-type MEF cells were a kind gift from Xiaodong Wong. IKKα-/- and IKKβ-/- cells were kindly provided by Inder M. Verma (15Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 35Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). A Moloney-based retrovirus expressing Myc-tagged IKKα or β-galactosidase was utilized with hygromycin selection to generate stable cell lines from parental IKK knockout cells, expressing either IKKα (IKKα+/+) or β-galactosidase (IKKα-/-), and has been described previously (23Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). IKKα-/- cells thus generated were similar to parental IKKα knockout cells and were used to perform different experiments. HeLa and 293 cells were obtained from ATCC. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum.Plasmids—Epitope-tagged IKKα and IKKβ wild-type and point mutants were previously described (7Mercurio F.

Charles Sherr kindly provided bacterial expression vectors encoding cyclin D1 or CDK4. The full-length cyclin D1 cDNA was cloned into pGEX-5X-1 at the BamHI-EcoRI sites. Truncated cyclin D1 fragment spanning residues 1–267 was subcloned by self-ligation following digestion of full-length cyclin D1 in pGEX-5X-1 with SalI restriction enzyme. The C terminus NcoI-XhoI fragment spanning residues 201–295 was subcloned into pGEX-KG vector. To make a construct encoding amino acids 201–262, a nonsense mutation substituting an amber stop codon (TAG) for a Gln codon (CAG) at positions 263 and 264 in cDNA encoding aa 201–295 of cyclin D1 was introduced by PCR mutagenesis using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Threonine residues in C terminus (aa 201–295) or full-length cyclin D1 were substituted with alanine, either individually or in combination. CMV expression vector encoding CDK4 was cloned into either FLAG-tagged or Myc-tagged pCMV5 at the BglI and SmaI sites. Cyclin D1 cDNA was cloned into both FLAG-tagged and Myc-tagged pCMV5 at the BamHI-SmaI and KpnI-BamHI sites, respectively. Full-length Rb cDNA was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-3. All cDNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Different GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described earlier (36Verma U.N. Yamamoto Y. Prajapati S.

The following antibodies were used during these assays: IKKα (OP-133; Oncogene), IKKβ (sc-7607; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), cyclin D1 (sc-718 and sc-72–13G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CDK4 (sc-260 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and CC19L (Oncogene)), CDK6 (sc-177; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CDK7 (sc-529; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin E1 (sc-481; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and actin (sc-1615; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Quantitative Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was performed for expression of cyclin D1 mRNA using total RNA prepared from different MEF cells, following a procedure as described earlier (36Verma U.N. Yamamoto Y. Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3509-3515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA was prepared with oligo(dT) and random primers (Invitrogen) from total RNA extracted from these cells at different time points following serum stimulation. For real time PCR, the prepared cDNA was analyzed in triplicate in a 20-μl volume with the SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles in the ABI sequence detection system. The oligonucleotide primers used to analyze transcripts were as follows: cyclin D1, aa 675–692 (5′-CTG CTA CCG CAC AAC GCA-3′) and aa 725–741 (5′-GCA GGC ACG GAG GCA GT-3′); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aa 825–843 (5′-TGA AGC AGG CAT CTG AGG G-3′) and aa 879–900 (5′-TTG AAG TCG CAG GAG ACA ACC-3′). Cyclin D1 mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed following a previously described protocol (23Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 38Kwak Y.T. Guo J. Prajapati S. Park K.J. Surabhi R.M. Miller B. Gehrig P. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1055-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) based on the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, chromatin from cross-linked cells that was sheared by a sonicator (3 × 15 s; one-third power) was incubated with specific antibody for overnight followed by incubation with salmon sperm DNA-saturated protein G-Sepharose. Precipitated DNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR (34 cycles) using a TaqPCR Master mix kit (Qiagen) and oligonucleotide primers for either the murine cyclin D1 promoter 5′-CCT CAC TGC TCC CGA GCC-3′ (-151 to -134) and 5′-TGG AGG CTG CAG GAC TTT GC-3′ (-1 to +19) or murine IκBα promoter site 5′-GGA CCC CAA ACC AAA ATC G-3′ (-316 to -308) and 5′-TCA GGC GCG GGG AAT TTC C-3′ (-15 to +4).In Vivo Cell Labeling—For in vivo phosphate labeling of cyclin D1, MEF cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without sodium phosphate for 6 h. Then cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a final concentration of 50 μCi/ml at 37 °C for 3 h. Labeling of the cyclin D1 was determined following immunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates with cyclin D1 antibody and autoradiography.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on different MEF cells and HeLa cells after RNA interference following a method described earlier (23Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In different MEF cells, cyclin D1 staining was performed on cells synchronized by serum starvation for 36 h followed by culture in serum-containing medium for variable time points up to 24 h. HeLa cells were used to determine cyclin D1 localization 72 h after transfection with siRNA to IKKα, IKKβ, and tax used as a control. BrdUrd staining was performed on cells labeled with BrdUrd for 16 h.RNA Interference—RNA interference-induced inhibition of IKKα and IKKβ was performed by transfection of siRNA cognate to IKKα (5′-CUU CAG GAA CAU CAC AGG CdTdT-3′), IKKβ (5′-GGU GGA AGA GGU GGU GAG CdTdT-3′), and HTLV-1 tax (5′-GAU GGA CGC GUU AUC GGC UdTdT-3′) as a control (Dharmacon Research Inc.) following a method as described earlier (39Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells at 30–40% confluence were transfected with annealed siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) at a final RNA concentration of 20 nm. 48 h after transfection of siRNA, cells were used for immunofluorescence microscopy, or whole cell lysate was prepared for immunoblotting.RESULTSCyclin D1 Is Constitutively Localized in the Nucleus in IKKα-/- Cells—Cyclin D localization in nuclear-cytoplasmic compartments varies with cell cycle and becomes exclusively cytoplasmic during the S phase (32Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 40Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that subcellular localization of cyclin D1 is regulated by GSK-3β (24Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar, 32Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 33Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We and other groups recently have shown that IKKα shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus (22Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 23Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether IKKα affects subcellular distribution of cyclin D1. Parental MEF, IKKα-/-, IKKβ-/-, and IKKα+/+ cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 48 h and stimulated to undergo active cycling by the addition of serum for 24 h. Cells were harvested at 0 and 24 h and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining with cyclin D1 antibody. Cyclin D1 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm in MEF and IKKβ-/- cells at 24 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, it was exclusively localized in the nucleus of IKKα-/- cells both in serum-starved cells as well as after stimulation with serum (Fig. 1A). To further confirm that nuclear localization of cyclin D1 in IKKα-/- cells is due to the absence of IKKα, we evaluated cyclin D1 localization in IKKα-reconstituted (IKKα+/+) cells. The expression of IKKα in these cells was confirmed previously (23Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and in this study by immunoblotting as seen in Fig. 2A. Most of the IKKα+/+ cells showed cyclin D1 in cytoplasmic distribution that is similar to that of MEF cells. These results indicate that IKKα is critical for nuclear export of cyclin D1 during the cell cycle.FIGURE 2IKKα regulates cyclin D1 expression. A, cells were stimulated with serum for 6 h after starvation for 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared and then subjected to Western blot (WB) analysis with the indicated antibodies. The same cell lysates were used to determine the expression level of cyclin D1 mRNA by reverse transcription followed by PCR (B) or real time PCR (C). Cyclin D1 mRNA levels were normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in real time PCR analysis. Bars, S.D. D, cells were treated with serum for 6 h, and chromatin cell lysates were prepared. ChIP assays were performed by immunoprecipitation with p65 antibody or IgG and then PCR with murine cyclin D1 promoter-specific primers. As a control, cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) for 30 min and subjected to p65 immunoprecipitation followed by PCR with murine IκBα promoter-specific primers. Input, 10% of DNA used for ChIP assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cyclin D1 can be predominantly localized in the nucleus of quiescent cells. Early cell cycle exit of IKKα-/- cells may result in observed nuclear localization pattern of cyclin D1 in these cells. To exclude this possibility, we performed BrdUrd labeling of asynchronously proliferating cells, followed by staining for BrdUrd and cyclin D1. The results indicate a similar pattern of cyclin D distribution in all of these cell lines. Cyclin D1 was mainly localized in the nucleus of IKKα-/- cells, even those incorporating BrdUrd as compared with other cells that showed cyclin D1 distribution either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that IKKα-/- cells enter into the S phase as demonstrated by BrdUrd incorporation, and even during the S phase, cyclin D1 remains nuclear in these cells. These results suggest that cyclin D1 nuclear localization in IKKα-/- cells is directly related to lack of IKKα.IKKα-/- Cells Show Overexpression of Cyclin D1—Current studies suggest that cell cycle phase-specific expression of different cyclins drives the cell cycle (28Murray A.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The levels of G1 cyclins such as cyclin D or cyclin E are increased during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle (25Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2699-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 28Murray A.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). We determined whether impaired subcellular localization of cyclin D1 is associated with the change in the level of cyclin D1 expression. The indicated cells were starved for 48 h and stimulated by the addition of serum. Cells were harvested at 0 and 6 h after serum stimulation and then subjected to Western blotting to determine expression of cyclin D1 and various other proteins known to play a role during early phases of cell cycle progression. Results showed that contrary to the expectation, cyclin D1 levels were markedly increased in IKKα-/- cells (5.6-fold higher) as compared with that of MEF or IKKβ-/- cells both at 0 and 6 h following serum stimulation (Fig. 2A). Cyclin D1 overexpression in IKKα-/- cells remained up to 24 h of culture in the presence of serum without significant change (data not shown). However, levels of E2F-regulated proteins, cyclin E and E2F, were lower in IKKα-/- cells as compared with MEF or IKKβ-/- cells. Other G1/S-specific proteins, including cyclin D partner kinases (CDK4 and CDK6) were similar in all cell lines. Increased accumulation of cyclin D1 in IKKα-/- cells was significantly decreased (50% of IKKα-/-) in IKKα+/+ cells (Fig. 2A).We addressed whether the observed accumulation of cyclin D1 in IKKα-/- cells is mediated by transcriptional regulation via IKKα. Total RNA was prepared from the cells that had been stimulated with serum for the indicated time following starvation as above. Reverse transcription followed by PCR was performed to determine the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA. The level of cyclin D1 mRNA was increased following serum stimulation in MEF cells as previously reported in other cell lines (20Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 41Albanese C. Wu K. D'Amico M. Jarrett C. Joyce D. Hughes J. Hulit J. Sakamaki T. Fu M.

However, the cyclin D1 mRNA levels in IKKα-/- cells were much higher than that of MEF or IKKβ-/- cells (Fig. 2B). The increased cyclin D1 mRNA levels in IKKα-/- cells were markedly reduced in IKKα-reconstituted IKKα-/- cells. Similar results were seen with quantitative real time PCR analysis (Fig. 2C), indicating that cyclin D1 mRNA is up-regulated in IKKα-/- cells.Previous reports have shown that NF-κB activates cyclin D1 gene expression. Thus, we determined whether NF-κB regulates increased expression of cyclin D1 in IKKα-/- cells using ChIP assays. Chromatin lysates were prepared from serum-treated cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation with p65 antibody followed by PCR with cyclin D1-specific primer. ChIP analysis indicated that p65 was recruited to cyclin D1 promoter, and this association was more prominent in IKKα-/- cells. No significant change was observed after exposure to serum. Recruitment of p65 to IκBα promoter was used as a control. As expected, there was a marked increase in recruitment of p65 to the IκBα promoter in parental MEF and IKKα-reconstituted cells; however, only minimal change was observed in IKKα-/- and IKKβ-/- cells. These results suggest that increased cyclin D1 expression in IKKα-/- cells can be secondary to increased p65 association to cyclin D1 promoter in the absence of IKKα.IKKα Interacts with and Phosphorylates Cyclin D1—Nuclear localization of cyclin D1 in IKKα-/- cells led us to hypothesize that IKKα regulates nuclear export of cyclin D1 by phosphorylation. To test this, we evaluated whether IKKα interacts with cyclin D1. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis showed that endogenous IKKα associates with endogenous cyclin D1 (Fig. 3A). 293 cells were transfected with CMV expression vector encoding either FLAG-tagged IKKα or control, and the cells were harvested. Cell lysates were prepared and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either cyclin D1 or cyclin B1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with FLAG antibody. The results demonstrate that IKKα interacts with endogenous cyclin D1 but not cyclin B1 (Fig. 3B). An in vitro pull-down assay using GST-cyclin D1 fusion protein indicated that cyclin D1, but not the Jun N-terminal domain used as a control, interacted with endogenous IKKα (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that IKKα directly associates with cyclin D1 both in vitro and in vivo.FIGURE 3IKKα interacts with the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex. A, whole cell lysates from 293 cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with cyclin D1, CDK4, or IKKα ant"

Because protein aggregation is implicated in SOD1-linked familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, abnormal intermolecular interactions between mutant SOD1 proteins could be relevant to the mechanism of pathogenesis in the disease. We have therefore applied NMR methods to ascertain whether abnormal contacts also form between S134N SOD1 molecules in solution and whether Cys-6 or Cys-111 plays any role in the aggregation. Our studies demonstrate that the behavior of fully metallated S134N SOD1 is dramatically different from that of fully metallated wild type SOD1 with a region of subnanosecond mobility located close to the site of the mutation. Such a high degree of mobility is usually seen only in the apo form of wild type SOD1, because binding of zinc to the zinc site normally immobilizes that region. In addition, concentration-dependent chemical shift differences were observed for S134N SOD1 that were not observed for wild type SOD1, indicative of abnormal intermolecular contacts in solution. We have here also established that the two free cysteines (6 and 111) do not play a role in this behavior.

The individual mutations have been shown to exert their pathological effects by a gain of function mechanism, implying that the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase variant (Cu,Zn-SOD) expressed from the mutated gene has in some way become toxic. Recent evidence suggests that SOD1-linked ALS, like many other neurodegenerative diseases, is a protein misfolding disorder characterized by abnormal deposits of aggregated proteins in neural tissues (1Bruijn L.I.

More recently it has been suggested that the toxic species are smaller, high molecular weight oligomerized proteins formed from abnormal contacts of misfolded proteins resulting in protofibrils, pores, or other toxic species (6Kirkitadze M.D. Bitan G.

High molecular weight forms of oligomerized mutant SOD1 have been observed in several studies using ALS-SOD1 transgenic mice (11Wang J. Xu G.L. Gonzales V. Coonfield M. Fromholt D. Copeland N.G.

Many of the ALS-linked Cu,Zn-SOD variant proteins have been expressed, purified, and characterized in an effort to identify properties that they hold in common that differ from the same properties of wild type Cu,Zn-SOD (5Valentine J.S. Doucette P.A. Potter S.Z. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 76: 563-569Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed a wide variability in their biophysical and biochemical properties. Those of the Cu,Zn-SOD variant proteins with modifications far from the metal binding region have normal SOD activities and spectroscopic characteristics. Their three-dimensional crystal structures are overall quite similar to those of wild type Cu,Zn-SOD and thus give no clues as to possible mechanisms of misfolding and aggregation (14Hough M.A. Grossmann J.G. Antonyuk S.V. Strange R.W. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A. Whitson L.J. Hart P.J. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Hasnain S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For that reason, it has been hypothesized that those mutant proteins may adopt a toxic form either prior to folding and metallation or subsequent to covalent modification or partial degradation (5Valentine J.S. Doucette P.A. Potter S.Z. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 76: 563-569Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 16Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By contrast, the Cu,Zn-SOD variant proteins with modifications near the metal-binding sites, i.e. in either the zinc or the electrostatic loops, show altered SOD activities and spectroscopic properties. Some of them, specifically metal-deficient S134N and H46R SOD1, have been shown to crystallize in filament-like arrays with abnormal contacts between the individual protein dimers (20Elam J.S. Taylor A.B. Strange R. Antonyuk S. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A. Hasnain S.S. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Yeates T.O. Hart P.J. Nature Struct.

Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1201-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of abnormal protein-protein contacts in the crystal structures of the ALS-linked Cu,Zn-SOD variant proteins suggests the possibility that similar intermolecular contacts may be made in solution in the earliest steps of the protein oligomerization that ultimately leads to aggregation. In the current study, several spectroscopic techniques have been applied to probe the structure and dynamics of the fully metallated S134N SOD1 protein in solution. Studies were carried out using both S134N asSOD1 and S134N wtSOD1. (“S134N asSOD1” or “asS134N” denotes a protein in which two additional mutations have been introduced, i.e. the 2 cysteine residues not involved in the intramolecular disulfide bond, Cys-6 and Cys-111, have been mutated to Ala and Ser, respectively. Those cysteines have not been removed in wtS134N or S134N wtSOD1). The former was used to ensure that any intermolecular contacts observed in solution were not due to formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds by air oxidation of the sample. Molecular Biology and Protein Characterization—The mutation S134N was introduced into asSOD1 by PCR mutagenesis, using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pPCuZnSODlIq as template. A plasmid encoding wtSOD1 and containing the same mutation was obtained by back mutation on pPCuZnSODlIq to get the wtSOD1 gene again and then inserting the mutation S134N as previously described. All the resulting constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutations. Escherichia coli TOPP1 strains were transformed with the obtained plasmids and with pPCuZnSODlIq. To get large amounts of enzymes, the protein was expressed in 2xYT complex medium (22Banci L. Bertini I. Chiu C.Y. Mullenbach G.T. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); to obtain uniformly 15N- and, when needed, 13C-labeled proteins for the sake of NMR studies, 15N- and 13C-enriched M9 chemically defined medium was used as described (23Banci L. Benedetto M. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Piccioli M. Richert T. Viezzoli M.S. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1997; 35: 845-853Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An exception was the case of wtS134N, which was expressed without addition of copper sulfate to the culture because some expression tests revealed a sharp decrease in the protein yield upon addition of such salt. In the case of S134N asSOD1, the protein was isolated and purified as reported (24Getzoff E.D. Cabelli D.E. Fisher C.L. Parge H.E. Viezzoli M.S. Banci L. Hallewell R.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of the proteins were stored at 4 °C, for short-term use, or at –20 °C. Further in vitro addition of Cu and Zn to the enzymes was not performed. Extraction and purification of S134N wtSOD1 followed the procedure of Hayward et al. (25Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) for insect cell cultures, adapted for use in E. coli. Because the 15N uniformly labeled wtS134N mutant showed lower solubility in ammonium sulfate than the unlabeled one, this specific enzyme was extracted from the cells using the same lysis buffer as the unlabeled one, but without NaCl, and was then purified by anionic exchange chromatography using the same protocol as for the asSOD1 mutants. In this case, 2 mm dithiothreitol was added to the elution buffers to keep the cysteines reduced during purification. Further in vitro addition of Cu and Zn was performed on the 15N-labeled enzyme following a well known procedure (26Beem K.M. Rich W.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because it appeared to be largely in the apo form when checked by bidimensional NMR. Metal content analysis of wtS134N and asS134N, obtained both from complex and chemically defined media, were performed using a Spectro Ciros charge-coupled device inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (Spectro Analytical Instruments) in combination with a Lichte nebulizer and a peristaltic pump for sample introduction. Concentrated stocks of proteins were diluted to a concentration of 3–5 μm in milliQ water. The inductively coupled plasma was programmed to detect three wavelengths for the Zn (202, 206, 213 nm) and three for the Cu (219, 219b, 324 nm), each measurement being repeated three times. The standardization curve was made using standard solutions in the range 0–10 μm Zn and Cu in milliQ water; a blank was also registered, using the protein buffer diluted in the same way as the samples themselves. Protein concentrations after dilution were determined using the Coomassie assay (Pierce Perbio) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Spectroscopic Characterization—Spectra of S134N asSOD1 and S134N wtSOD1 were recorded both in the visible and in the UV range of wavelengths, using samples of concentration 10–4m in the first case and diluting them 10-fold in the latter. The samples, in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5, were centrifuged before performing the measurements. Circular dichroism was used to characterize the secondary structure content of the mutants as well as the copper coordination environment. For the near-UV, spectra were collected on samples with concentrations ranging from 10 to 25 μm, at 298 K in the wavelength range 250–190 nm, on a Jasco J-810 spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier unit. In the visible region spectra have been acquired on a 500-μm sample at 298 K in the wavelength 250–1000 nm, in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5. EPR spectra were recorded at 180 K on an Elexsys E500 spectrometer (Bruker), equipped with X-band microwave bridge (microwave frequency 9.45 GHz) and an ER 4131 VT unit for temperature control. 1-mm protein samples in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 were used. NMRD measurements were performed on a set of 3 to 4 mm protein samples in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.0. Two distinct sets of measurements were performed, on the freshly prepared samples and on the same samples incubated at room temperature for a week, to promote oligomerization of the mutants. All measurements were made at a constant temperature of 298 K. To avoid the paramagnetic effect, reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) was achieved by addition of 1.2–1.5 equivalents of p-isoascorbic acid dissolved in degassed 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5, under reducing conditions. Longitudinal water proton relaxation rates were measured with a Stelar prototype of fast field cycling relaxometer (proton Larmor frequency 0.01–40 MHz). 1H NMRD profiles were obtained by plotting water proton relaxation rates, after subtracting the relaxation rates of the buffer and normalizing the rates to 1 mm protein concentration, as a function of applied magnetic field. High Field NMR—All the protein samples were in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, and the Cu(II) ion was reduced according to the procedure described above. The protein concentration (calculated according to the monomer) in the 15N samples was in the range 1.0–1.5 mm, whereas in 13C, 15N samples were in the range 2.0–2.5 mm. For mutant asS134N, several experiments were performed with the aim of achieving extensive spectra assignment: HNHA, HCCH-TOCSY, 13C-HSQC-NOESY, and 15N-HSQC-NOESY on a Bruker Avance 900 MHz and HNCOCA and HNCA at 500 MHz. Mobility experiments were performed on both mutants using a Bruker 600-MHz spectrometer. For concentration- and time-dependent experiments, an 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with cryoprobe was used. For the purpose of hydrogen/deuterium exchange, a sample of asS134N was reduced as previously described; the p-isoascorbic acid was then discarded by using a Pd-10 column under a reducing atmosphere, and the enzyme was lyophilized at –50 °C and ∼0.5 bar. The sample was resuspended in D2O, and p-isoascorbic acid was again added. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired every hour for a total of 72 h using a 900-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Structure Modeling—NOE cross-peaks in three-dimensional 15N and 13 C NOESY-HSQC spectra were integrated for the region flanking the mutation (residues 120–140) and for residues spatially close in the solution structure of the non-mutated protein (residues 70–76, 43–46, 61–63, 85, 86). Volumes were converted into 691 upper distance limits for inter-proton distances with the program CALIBA (27Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). For the remaining part of the protein upper distances were evaluated by the solution structure and used as additional constraints. Some NOE crosspeaks regarding this part of the protein were integrated in order to calibrate the calculated distances in the region surrounding the mutation. Structure calculations were performed using the program DYANA (28Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Two hundred random conformers of one subunit were annealed using the above constraints in 10,000 steps. The final family was made up of 20 structures with the lowest values for the target function. The S134N asSOD1 protein was isolated with two copper and two zinc ions (supplemental Table S1) as it has been seen previously for the asSOD1 in our expression system (24Getzoff E.D. Cabelli D.E. Fisher C.L. Parge H.E. Viezzoli M.S. Banci L. Hallewell R.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It is in the dimeric form, as indicated by gel filtration measurements (data not shown) and as further confirmed by 15N NMR relaxation data and field-dependent water relaxation rates on freshly prepared samples (see below). The mutant was characterized at 298 K and pH 5 using freshly prepared protein samples. The copper(II) form was used for the electronic absorption, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra to take advantage of the spectroscopic features of this metal ion for the characterization of the metal-binding site, whereas the copper(I) form of the protein was used for NMR and NMRD characterization to avoid paramagnetic effects that would complicate the spectral analysis. These last two sets of data were used to monitor the structural and dynamic features of the protein. The experimental data on the two oxidation states of the protein were then analyzed to obtain a complete picture of the mutant. The Copper-binding Site—The copper coordination environment is only slightly altered with respect to that of the asSOD1 protein. Indeed, the CD spectrum in the visible region is essentially superimposable on that of native SOD1, with a negative band at 13,200 cm–1 and a positive band at 16,600 cm–1 (29Banci L. Bertini I. Cabelli D.E. Hallewell R.A. Tung J.W. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum (supplemental Fig. S1) is characterized by g// = 2.26, g⊥ = 2.06, and A = 154 × 10–4// cm–1, i.e. parameters very close to those of native SOD1 (29Banci L. Bertini I. Cabelli D.E. Hallewell R.A. Tung J.W. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, at variance with the native protein, which possesses a rhombic spectrum, the spectrum of asS134N is essentially axial. Axial EPR spectra have been observed for some other SOD1 mutant proteins, not related to ALS (29Banci L. Bertini I. Cabelli D.E. Hallewell R.A. Tung J.W. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating a more tetragonal geometry for copper(II) bound in these mutants. Structural and Dynamic Properties—The secondary β-structure is essentially conserved, as suggested by CD measurements in the far UV region. The 15N-1H HSQC spectra of the asS134N and asSOD1 proteins are substantially superimposable (Fig. 1A), with the exception of a few resonances. Meaningful shift differences between asSOD1 and the asS134N variant are clustered in the surroundings of the mutation as summarized in Fig. 1B, from which is it clear that residues 127–140 sense a different environment in the mutant. The chemical shift for residues 130–140 approaches those typical for isolated amino acids as for random coil polypeptides, and the 3JHNHa values are in the range 4.6–7.2 Hz. The 1H, 15 N, and 13 consistently C resonance assignments for asS134N are reported in supplemental Table S2. The differences in chemical shifts for the backbone amides in this protein area are accompanied by differences in the dynamic properties of residues in the same area, in particular for residues 129–137 (Fig. 2). 15 N relaxation rates of proteins and {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs are sensitive to the overall protein tumbling and to local motions either faster than the protein tumbling or much slower, i.e. in the range of tens of microseconds to milliseconds that is typical of conformational equilibria. In the present case, the average values for R1, R2, and NOE, if the 129–137 fragment is not considered, were 0.80 ± 0.10 s–1, 25.8 ± 4.5 s–1, and 0.78 ± 0.14, respectively, which are very close to those of the asSOD1 protein (30Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Rosato A. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9108-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). R1 rates for the 129–137 fragment are sensibly larger, with average values of 1.10 ± 0.10 s–1. R2 rates and heteronuclear NOEs decrease dramatically to values in the range 11–23 s–1 for R2 and to values smaller than 0.55 for the NOE. The 15N relaxation parameters were instead uniform along the entire sequence in the protein with the native amino acid in position 134. The present data therefore point at extensive mobility on the nanosecond time scale in the protein segment 129–137, where an Asn replaces the native Ser. The average rotational correlation time for a protein can in principle be estimated from the R2/R1 ratio. However, the ratio R2/R1 is also affected by the presence of conformational exchange and by motional anisotropy. On the other hand, the product R1R2 is independent of the overall correlation time and motional anisotropy and therefore can be used to highlight residues undergoing chemical exchange (31Kneller J.M. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1852-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A plot of R1R2 values for asS134N is shown in Fig. 2D, where an increase in the R1R2 values due to the presence of conformational exchange on the microsecond-millisecond time range is observed for a number of residues, consistent with the asSOD1 data (30Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Rosato A. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9108-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, reduced R1R2 values for residues 129–137 are observed, which further confirms the presence of fast motions for this protein fragment. From the ratio R2/R1, with the exclusion of residues involved in local fast motions or conformational exchange, an average correlation time for the protein tumbling of 18.1 ± 1.9 ns was estimated. Residues 129–137 experience an average correlation time of 12.3 ± 2.0 ns, which represents an estimate of the effective correlation time for the dipolar interactions in the 129–137 fragment. The 1H NMRD profiles report the water relaxation rates as a function of the magnetic field of millimolar solutions of protein and monitor the overall protein tumbling time. The profiles for the freshly prepared asS134N and asSOD1 are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. Their best fit was performed using the Model-free approach (32Bertini I. Fragai M. Luchinat C. Parigi G. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2000; 38: 543-550Crossref Google Scholar) (solid line), which provides an estimate of correlation time for the protein tumbling. For the asS134N variant this value is 20.0 ns and compares well with that of the asSOD1, for which a correlation time of 20.5 ns is calculated, thus clearly confirming that the mutant is also in the dimeric state. Moreover, these correlation times are completely consistent with the values found from 15N relaxation rates. The time dependence of the hydrogen/deuterium exchange of backbone NH resonances provides information on their solvent accessibility. The per-residue exchange behavior of the asS134N mutant, as followed through 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded every hour for 72 h after dissolving in D2O a lyophilized sample of the protein, is similar to that of the asSOD1 studied under the same conditions (33Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with the exception of the area surrounding the mutation. Indeed, in the asS134N variant, the backbone NHs of residues 127–143 are fully exchanged within the first hour, with residue 131 being completely exchanged within 2 h. In the case of the asSOD1, the residues in these areas exchange more slowly; complete exchange was reported to occur after ∼6 h for Gly-129, Asn-131, and Thr-133 and after more than 12 h for Ser-134 and Lys-136 (33Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Faster exchange in the variant in the area of the mutation is consistent with the presence of fast motions and lack of secondary structure, which make the backbone NHs more solvent accessible. The number of NOEs/residue as measured from the 1H-15N HSQC-NOESY spectrum of asS134N mutant for the protein area around the mutation site is comparable with that observed for the native protein (33Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although most of the NOEs are sensibly reduced in intensity. This effect is consistent with the presence of fast motions in this protein region as discussed above. Furthermore, the backbone sequential NOEs, as well as the 3JHNHα and CSI values, do not indicate the presence of the short helix present in the native structure. Differences in long-range NOE patterns were not detected, except for a generic reduction in intensity that in some cases makes undetectable the NOEs that were already weak in asSOD1. In particular, the long-range NOEs between the 129–137 region characterized by fast internal motions and the protein fragment facing it in the structure of asSOD1 (residues 125–127) are weaker. However, these contacts are not lost, with the exception of those between the NH of Asp-125 and the side chain of residue 134 (the mutated residue). The introduction of a new residue slightly changed the NOE patterns for residue 134. The structural model, calculated as described under “Materials and Methods,” shows the region flanking the mutation quite disordered with backbone root mean square deviation values for the fragment 127–140 of 1.58 Å. Tendency to Oligomerize—A macroscopic difference between the native protein and the asS134N mutant is the tendency of the latter to give rise to high molecular weight species in concentrated protein solutions. Such high molecular weight species are clearly observable as insoluble entities in the NMR tube after a few days. The presence of large molecular weight protein forms was monitored through NMRD profiles. Although the freshly prepared protein has a profile very similar to that of the as form (Fig. 3, A and B), with time a new dispersion at lower field appears (Fig. 3C), indicating the presence of species with slow tumbling rates, i.e. of larger molecular weight. The relaxation dispersion profiles provide two independent correlation times, one as an average value for the large molecular weight species and one for the dimeric protein. For the latter a correlation time corresponding to that of the freshly prepared samples was obtained (19.0 ns). The extent of the oligomerization depends on protein concentration and time, but the disper"

T cell transformation induced by HTLV-I involves the action of the 40-kDa viral Tax transactivator protein. Tax both stimulates the HTLV-I long terminal repeat and deregulates the expression of select cellular genes by altering the activity of specific host transcription factors, including cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor, NF-κB/Rel, and serum response factor. To study initiating events involved in HTLV-I Tax-induced T cell transformation, we generated “Tet-off” transgenic mice conditionally expressing in a lymphocyte-restricted manner (EμSRα promoter-enhancer) either wild-type Tax or mutant forms of Tax that selectively compromise the NF-κB (M22) or CREB/activating transcription factor (M47) activation pathways. Wild-type Tax and M47 Tax-expressing mice, but not M22-Tax expressing mice, developed progressive alopecia, hyperkeratosis, and skin lesions containing profuse activated CD4 T cell infiltrates with evidence of deregulated inflammatory cytokine production. In addition, these animals displayed systemic lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. These findings suggest that Tax-mediated activation of NF-κB plays a key role in the development of this aggressive skin disease that shares several features in common with the skin disease occurring during the preleukemic stage in HTLV-I-infected patients. Of note, this skin disease completely resolved when Tax transgene expression was suppressed by administration of doxycycline, emphasizing the key role played by this viral oncoprotein in the observed pathology.

ATL develops in 1-3% of infected individuals but only after a very prolonged period of latency often lasting between 20 and 50 years (2Uchiyama T. Annu. Rev.

It is currently believed that the chronic or smoldering forms of ATL may represent a preleukemic stage of disease that will in time progress to full-blown acute ATL. This evolution of disease is often associated with an initial polyclonal expansion of CD4+ cells supplanted later by a monoclonal expansion of fully transformed CD4+ T cells. The molecular basis for these HTLV-I-induced diseases remains rather poorly understood. However, the Tax gene product of HTLV-I encoded within the 3′ pX region of the virus appears importantly involved. Tax alone is sufficient to promote oncogenic effects in many different cellular environments, including various transgenic animal models (20Tanaka A. Takahashi C. Yamaoka S. Nosaka T. Maki M.

However, full recapitulation of ATL-like malignancies comprised of CD3+, CD4+, IL-2Rα+, and HLA-DR+ tumor cells has not yet been achieved in these transgenic models. HTLV-I Tax does not act by binding directly to DNA; rather it alters the activity of various host transcription factors through protein-protein interactions. Tax action promotes increased activity of the integrated HTLV-I long terminal repeat and altered expression of select subset of cellular genes (reviewed in Ref. 27Azran I. Schavinsky-Khrapunsky Y. Aboud M. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Specifically, Tax enhances HTLV-I gene expression by directing the assembly of a quaternary complex composed of CREB, Tax, and CBP that stimulates transcription from the HTLV-I long terminal repeat. Many cellular genes are transcriptionally activated through the effects of Tax on the NF-κB/Rel family of enhancer-binding proteins. Tax induction of NF-κB appears to involve its assembly with the NF-κB essential modulator component of the IκB kinase complex leading to constitutive activation of the IκB kinases and sustained induction of IκBα phosphorylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of this NF-κB inhibitor (28Sun S.C. Ballard D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These events liberate the NF-κB heterodimer (p50/RelA), allowing for its rapid translocation into the nucleus where it engages cognate κB enhancers and increases the expression of select cellular target genes. Using wild-type (wt) and mutant forms of Tax that selectively compromise stimulation of the CREB (M47 Tax) or NF-κB (M22 Tax) transcription pathways (29Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 30Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), many investigators have studied the transforming properties of Tax in vitro. Two studies implicated a role for the CREB/activating transcription factor pathway in the Tax-mediated transformation (31Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Rosin O. Koch C. Schmitt I. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Grassmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6698-6703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conversely, three groups found that Tax-mediated induction of NF-κB is critical for cellular transformation (33Yamaoka S. Inoue H. Sakurai M. Sugiyama T. Hazama M. Yamada T. Hatanaka M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 34Robek M.D. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Bilakovics J. Brown D.A. Xu X. Nerenberg M. Science. 1992; 258: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Finally, the clonal transformation of primary CD4 T lymphocytes by Tax required the concomitant activation of both the CREB/activating transcription factor and NF-κB pathways (36Akagi T. Ono H. Nyunoya H. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These in vitro findings highlight the current uncertainty that surrounds the precise mechanism by which Tax exerts its oncogenic effects. In this study, we have attempted to explore early Tax-induced events involved in lymphocyte transformation occurring in vivo. For this analysis, transgenic mice conditionally expressing wt Tax (NF-κB+/CREB+), M47 Tax (NF-κB+/CREB-), and M22 Tax (NF-κB-/CREB+) were prepared. Expression of these various Tax analogues was confined to the lymphocyte compartment through the use of EμSRα-tTA to drive the Tet-O-Tax transgenes. Expression of the Tax transgenes could be suppressed in these animals by administration of doxycycline, which blocks the stimulatory action of tTA (Tet-off system). We observed that wt Tax and M47 Tax, but not M22 Tax, transgenic mice develop a progressive and ultimately lethal skin disease resembling the dermatological abnormalities present in various preleukemic stages of HTLV-I infection. Suppression of Tax expression led to complete resolution of this aggressive skin disease, indicating that continuous expression of this viral transactivator is required for progression of this florid dermatopathology. Additionally, we observed profuse infiltration of the involved skin with activated, Tax-expressing T cells and increased local expression of inflammatory cytokines in the skin of these Tax transgenic mice. Together, these findings suggest that Tax induction of the observed skin disease involves intense infiltration of the dermis and epidermis with Tax-expressing T cells leading in turn to NF-κB-dependent, sustained expression of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines likely serve as key effector molecules producing the severe, progressive skin disease. Transgenic Mice—EμSRα-tTA/Tet-o-wt/M22/M47 Tax (tTA/Tax) mice were generated in two steps. First, independent Tet-O-wt, M22, and M47 Tax (Tax) mice were generated by pronuclear microinjection of DNA fragments containing the Tet-operon and wt, M22, and M47 Tax cDNA into freshly fertilized mouse oocytes. The Tet-operon contains the Tet-responsive element comprised of seven copies of the 42-bp Tet operator sequence positioned upstream of the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter. Subsequently, Tet-o-Tax mice were bred with EμSRα-tTA “driver” mice (tTA) (37Felsher D.W. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4 (03): 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) to generate bigenic mice expressing Tax under the control of tetracycline (Tet-off). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with frequent monitoring. Skin Cell Preparation and Flow Cytometry—Shaved skin from individual mice was removed and scraped free of subcutaneous tissue with a scalpel. Subsequently, the skin was cut into small pieces and incubated in 2.5 mg/ml collagenase II and IV (Invitrogen) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C (38Williams I.R. Rawson E.A.

Med. 2003; 197: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Skin cell suspensions were then filtered through a 100-μm mesh. Flow cytometric studies were performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) on skin cell suspensions previously immunostained with directly conjugated antibodies from BD PharMingen specific for various cell surface markers, including CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (RM4-5), CD8 (53-6.7), TCRβ (H57-597), and TCRγδ (GL3). Green fluorescent protein expression in Tax expressing cells transduced with lentiviruses containing 5× NF-κB or HTLV-I long terminal repeat d1EGFP was also analyzed by flow cytometry (see supplemental data). Western Blotting—The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Western lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Equivalent amounts of protein extracts were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoretic separation, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in buffer containing 30 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 10% methanol for 1 h. The membranes were blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature with anti-Tax (40Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Grant M. Connelly M.A. Hambor J.E. Marcu K.B. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell.

After serial washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the membranes were reacted with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using an enhanced chemoluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Skin biopsies were preserved in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek) for frozen sections and 10% buffered formalin for paraffin-embedded fixed sections. Select samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin in the Gladstone Microscopy Core. Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses of skin cryosections were performed using a VectaStain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) with primary antibodies directed against CD3 (500A2), CD4 (RM4-5), CD8 (53-6.7), B220 (RA3-6B2), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), I-A/I-E (2G9), ICAM (3E2, PharMingen), interferon-γ (IFN-γ; MAB1152, Chemicon), and IL-1β (AF-401-NA)/IL-10 (AF519) from R & D according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent immunostaining was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using antibodies specific for keratin 6 (K6, PRB-169P), K10 (PRB-159P), keratin 14 (K14; PRB-155P), and loricrin (PRB-145P) from Covance and p65 (C-20; Santa Cruz) in combination with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Histology and immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were performed with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (MS106-p0) stained with AEC system from Lab Vision Corp. Antigen retrieval was performed when required. The sections were also counterstained to define tissue structure and nuclei with tetramethyl rhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) and Hoechst (Molecular Probes). The slides were analyzed using an Arcturus PixCell II, Nikon Eclipse TE300, or Olympus BX60 confocal microscope with the Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Laser Scanning System. RNase Protection Assays and Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini or micro kit (Qiagen) from Tax-expressing Jurkat cells (see supplemental data) or the skin of mice and then subjected to RNase protection assay according to the manufacturer's instructions using the hAPO3 (for Jurkat cells, see supplemental data), mCK1b, mCK2b, mCK3, and mCR5 multi-probe sets (BD PharMingen). The resulting protected RNAs were separated on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. Total RNA was extracted as described above from thymocytes, skin cells, CD3+, and CD3- cells present in the skin of mice. RNA was analyzed by real time reverse transcription-PCR. The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (RQ1 DNase; Promega) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNAs were amplified with the HOTaq PCR mix (Mclab, South San Francisco, CA). The real time reaction mix was as recommended by the manufacturer with 400 nm primers (see below), 200 nm probe (see below), and 50 ng of linear acrylamide (Ambion). The sequences of primers and probe for tTA were: forward primer, 5′-TCG ACG CCT TAG CCA TTG A-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTG CCA GCT TTC CCC TTC T-3′; probe, 5′-VIC-TGT TAG ATA GGC ACC ATA CTC ACT TTT GCC CTT-TAMRA-3′. 18 S rRNA was used to normalize each PCR. Primers and probes for the 18 S rRNA were obtained commercially (ABI) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplifications were performed using the ABI-Prism 7700 sequence detection system. Genomic DNA PCR—Genomic DNA was isolated from sorted CD3+/CD4+ T cells present in mouse skin for analysis of TCRβ rearrangement by PCR using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). PCRs were prepared with genomic DNA in PCR mixture containing 1× Pfx buffer, 0.3 mm dNTP (Amersham Biosciences), 0.1 μCi/μl [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 μm primers (see below), and 0.25 units of Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen). Primers used for rearrangement were: for Dβ1-Jβ1, TCRB-D1U-S and TCRB-JD2-A; for Dβ2-Dβ1, TCRB-D2U-S and TCRB-J2D-A; for Vβ1-Jβ2, TCRB-V1-S and TCRB-J2D-A; for Vβ2-Jβ2, TCRB-V2-S and TCRB-J2D-A; for Vβ6-Jβ2, TCRB-V6-S and TCRB-J2D-A; for Vβ10-Jβ2, TCRB-V10-S and TCRB-J2D-A; and for IgM control, IgM-S and IgM-A (41Gartner F.

The PCR mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 59 °C, and polymerization for 1 min 30 s at 68 °C, and the resulting PCRs were resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. Transgenic Mice Conditionally Expressing HTLV-I Tax in Lymphocytes Develop Progressive Skin Disease—To study early events involved in the initiation of Tax-mediated T cell transformation and to discern which host transcription factor pathway(s) are required for these events, we generated transgenic mice conditionally expressing HTLV-I wt, M22 (CREB+/NF-κB-), and M47 (CREB-/NF-κB+) Tax in a lymphocyte-restricted manner. The conditional nature of Tax expression in these transgenic mice (Tet-off system) also permitted assessment of whether continued expression of Tax was required for maintenance of the observed changes or conversely was only required for the initiation of the pathological process. To construct these multiple transgenic lines, we introduced Tax or the Tax mutants under the control of the Tet-operon (Tet-O) into the pronucleus of freshly fertilized mouse oocytes. The Tet-O-wt, M22 and M47 Tax constructs used for establishment of the various Tax transgenic cell lines displayed precisely the predicted transcriptional activities (see supplemental data). Conditional activation of Tax transgene expression was achieved by breeding these mice to “driver” mice expressing tTA under the control of the EμSRα promoter/enhancer cassette, thereby limiting expression of the Tax transgenes to T and B lymphocytes (37Felsher D.W. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4 (03): 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In this system, the addition of doxycyline (Dox) inhibits tTA action promoting silencing of transgene expression (Tet-off). Six independent founder lines for Tax wt, M22, and M47 were identified displaying tight Dox regulation. The use of six independent founders for each Tax line provided a broad array of transgenic animals for study and avoided potential artifacts related to the site of transgene integration. Representative genotyping results from four mice that were produced by mating of heterozygous EμSRα-tTA (referred as tTA hereafter) and heterozygous Tet-o-wt Tax (referred as Tax hereafter) are shown in Fig. 1A. Lanes 1 and 2 show mice containing only the tTA or Tax transgenes respectively, whereas the mice shown in lanes 3 and 4 are bigenic, containing both the tTA and Tax transgenes. When Tax protein expression was evaluated in the thymocytes of mice by immunoblotting with anti-Tax antibodies (Fig. 1B), the bigenic mouse shown in lane 3 expressed readily detectable quantities of Tax. However, when a bigenic littermate mouse shown in lane 4 was fed with Dox chow (200 mg/kg) for 10 days prior to analysis, expression of Tax was no longer detectable. Similar Dox-regulatable expression of Tax was observed with bigenic mice from each of the 18 founder lines. Down-regulation of Tax expression occurred as early as 3 days following Dox treatment (data not shown). These findings underscore the conditional and highly regulatable nature of Tax expression in these transgenic animals. Strikingly, beginning at 4 months of age, mice from three wt Tax and four M47 Tax bigenic lines (referred as tTA/Tax mice hereafter) exhibited progressive alopecia and exfoliation of the skin. These skin lesions first appeared around the neck area and progressed to involve nearly the entire body at 8 months (Fig. 1D). Many of these tTA/Tax mice also exhibited marked splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1E and data not shown). The genetic penetrance of the skin disease phenotype in wt Tax and M47 Tax transgenic mice was 25.9 and 23.2%, respectively. None of the 124 M22 Tax transgenic mice examined developed skin disease. Wide time lags of 3-17 weeks of age were observed for the onset of the skin disease phenotype. These affected mice remained fertile, but litter size was reproducibly small. After inbreeding, the successive generations developed more pronounced skin disease that appeared as early as 3 weeks after birth. This acceleration of disease likely reflected increasing homozygosity of the two transgenes. Animals developing skin disease as early as 3 weeks after birth died within 4 weeks. Thymic atrophy was observed in Tax transgenic mice as shown in prior Tax transgenic mice (43Furuta Y. Aizawa S. Suda Y. Ikawa Y. Kishimoto H. Asano Y. Tada T. Hikikoshi A. Yoshida M. Seiki M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3185-3189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both spleen and liver appeared pale in the Tax transgenic mice, and red blood cell counts were 2-fold lower compared with control mice. The absolute number of circulating lymphocytes in the Tax transgenic mice was 4.3-fold lower than control mice; however, the Tax transgenic mice displayed neutrophilia (absolute number of circulating neutrophils in Tax transgenic mice was three times higher than in control mice). All other organs and tissues in the Tax transgenic mice were histologically unremarkable. Affected tTA/Tax mice could be distinguished even earlier than 3 weeks based on their smaller size compared with healthy littermates (Fig. 1F). To rule out the possibility that the absence of skin disease in the M22 Tax transgenic mice was due to impaired M22 Tax expression, levels of this Tax mutant were compared with that of wt Tax in thymocytes (Fig. 1C). As shown in lanes 2 and 4, comparable amounts of M22 Tax were detected relative to wtTax. Thus, the absence of the skin disease phenotype in these animals cannot be attributed to reduced expression of the M22 Tax protein. Of note, such skin disease was never observed in any of the M22 Tax transgenic mouse lines where Tax induction of NF-κB is defective. These findings reveal an interesting pathological condition occurring in multiple founder lines of animals expressing either wild-type Tax or M47 Tax (NF-κB+/CREB-). Microscopic analysis of the skin from tTA/Tax mice revealed marked hyperkeratosis (thickened keratin layer; Fig. 1H, asterisk), acanthosis (epidermal thickening; Fig. 1H, blue line), and parakeratosis (thickened keratin with"
https://openalex.org/W2021928522,"The three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes is essential for the reconstruction of functional hepatic tissues in vitro. In the present experiment, we developed a 3D-culture method in order to reconstruct hepatic cordlike structures by stacking up two-dimensional (2D) tissues composed of rat small hepatocytes (SHs), which are hepatic progenitor cells. Pairs of membranes were prepared and the cells were separately cultured on each membrane. After the SH colonies had developed, one membrane was inverted on top of the other to form an SH bilayer. Thereafter, we investigated whether the stacked cells were organized into differentiated tissues. In the 3D stacked-up structures, bile canaliculi (BC) started to form and gradually developed into anastomosing networks. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the SHs of the upper and lower layers adhered to one another, and that BC formed between them. Bile canalicular proteins localized on the lumina of the tubular structures. Furthermore, the cells within the structures exhibited mRNA transcription of the hepatic-differentiation markers and maintained a relatively high level of albumin secretion. We conclude that highly differentiated 3D tissues, including functional BC, can be reconstructed by stacking up layers of SHs. This 3D stacked-up culture is useful for the reconstruction of tissue-engineered livers."

Almost 40 years ago Vagelos and Larrabee (Vagelos, P. R., and Larrabee, A. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 1776-1781) reported an enzyme from Escherichia coli that removed the prosthetic group.

Jackowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The paradigm ACPs are those of bacterial fatty acid synthesis where the sulfhydryl group of the 4′-PP moiety carries the growing fatty acid chain (1Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition to bacteria, ACPs are found in plant plastids (2Ohlrogge J.B. Kuo T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8032-8037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mitochondria (3Wada H. Shintani D. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 4′-PP moiety is attached to the apo form of ACP by enzymes called 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (5Walsh C.T. Gehring A.M. Weinreb P.H. Quadri L.E. Flugel R.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli AcpS (ACP synthase) was the first such enzyme described (6Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P.

Indeed, these ACP-like proteins have the same general four-helix bundle structure predicted (9Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Soon after the identification of the prosthetic group of ACP as 4′-PP and of 4′-PP transferase activity, Vagelos and Larrabee (13Vagelos P.R. Larrabee A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1776-1781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported an activity that removed the 4′-PP moiety of ACP in E. coli. The enzyme (called ACP hydrolyase and now called ACP phosphodiesterase) was partially purified and shown to require a divalent ion and produce apo-ACP and 4′-PP (13Vagelos P.R. Larrabee A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1776-1781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was inactive on peptide fragments of ACP suggesting that it recognized the folded structure of ACP (13Vagelos P.R. Larrabee A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1776-1781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although crude preparations were occasionally used to convert holo-ACP to apo-ACP, this paper remained the only study of this enzyme for 23 years until Fischl and Kennedy (14Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported its purification to apparent homogeneity. These workers showed that ACP phosphodiesterase was an unusually stable protein of Mr 25,000 and reported an N-terminal sequence attributed to the enzyme protein. Unfortunately, the N-terminal sequence was found to be that of a flavin-containing protein that lacked phosphodiesterase activity 3D. Keating and J. Cronan, unpublished data., 4T. Stachelhaus and C. Walsh, personal communication. and which has recently been shown to be an azoreductase (15Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46394-46399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It seems that Fischl and Kennedy (14Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had determined the sequence of a major contaminating protein rather than that of the phosphodiesterase. Regrettably based on this erroneous sequence attribution, many genes (often called acpD) have been annotated in bacterial genomes as encoding ACP phosphodiesterase rather than azoreductase.The discovery of ACP phosphodiesterase activity logically raised the question of whether or not the prosthetic group of ACP turns over independently of the protein moiety. This was soon shown to be the case (16Powell G.L. Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5616-5624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although interpretation of these data were complicated by the large pools of CoA and its thioesters. Elegant deuterium labeling experiments subsequently showed that the rate of ACP prosthetic group turnover depended on the intracellular concentration of CoA (17Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1891-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At low CoA levels, prosthetic group turnover was four times faster than the rate of new synthesis of the protein moiety, but at the higher coenzyme A concentrations characteristic of logarithmic growth, turnover was an order of magnitude slower, amounting to ∼25% of the ACP pool per generation (17Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1891-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We report the isolation of the gene encoding the ACP phosphodiesterase of E. coli. We have named the gene acpH based on the original enzyme name given by Vagelos and Larrabee (13Vagelos P.R. Larrabee A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1776-1781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to prevent overlap with the mistaken AcpD annotations. The protein has been purified to homogeneity and its substrate specificity studied. The acpH gene has also been deleted from the E. coli chromosome and the consequences of loss of the enzyme studied.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).

Strain MG1655 DNA purified using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) was sheared to ∼30-50-kb fragments by repeated pipetting. Sheared DNA was then end repaired to generate blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase and run on a 1% low melting point agarose gel. Fragments ∼40 kb in size were excised, DNA was recovered from the gel and ligated to Eco72I-digested pCC1FOS. The ligation mixture was size-selected by packaging into λ phage particles and used to infect EPI300 to chloramphenicol resistance. Transformants were restreaked and separated into sets of 50 based on colony size. Individual cultures of each set of colonies were grown overnight in LB/chloramphenicol, pooled together, and diluted to A600 of 0.2 in 100 ml of the same medium. Each pooled culture was grown to A600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.02% arabinose for a further 4 h. The cells were washed with an equal volume of AcpH storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer, and lysed by sonication. Cell-free extracts were assayed for AcpH activity as described above. The pool whose extract showed a level of AcpH activity above that of the vector control was further subdivided into 10 sets of five colonies each and pooled cultures were grown, induced, and lysed as before. In the final screen of the library extracts were made and assayed from cultures grown from single colonies. Cosmid DNA was isolated from an induced culture of the clone (pJT1) expressing AcpH (Qiagen Large Construct kit) and used to transform strain EPI300. Upon confirmation of increased activity, the encoding gene was subcloned from cosmid pJT1 as follows. The cosmid DNA was diluted to 20 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) buffer and sonicated for 4 s at the lowest power setting. The sheared DNA was end-repaired as above and fractionated on a 1% agarose gel. Fragments of 2-3 kb were extracted from the gel and ligated to Eco721-digested pCC1FOS. The ligation mixture was used to transform EPI300, and 200 clones were screened as before. Cosmid DNA was purified from clones that showed increased AcpH activity and sequenced with primers CC1Fos-F and CC1Fos-R.DNA Manipulations—The sequences of the primers used are given in TABLE ONE. The acpH gene was PCR amplified from pJT1 using primers yajB-pET101-F and yajB-pET101-R. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the TOPO vector pET101D to give plasmid pJT4 in which a C-terminal His-tagged AcpH was expressed from a T7 promoter. The acpH sequence was also PCR-amplified using primers yajB-pBAD-F and yajB-pBAD-R and the KpnI- and PstI-digested PCR products were cloned into pBAD322 digested with the same enzymes to give plasmid pJT5. Strain JT1 was constructed using the λ Red-mediated recombination system (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar). The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene from plasmid pKD3 was amplified using primers yajB-KCm-F and yajB-KCm-R and electroporated into strain MC1061 carrying the helper plasmid pKD46 resulting in replacement of the entire coding sequence of acpH with the cat gene. Chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were verified by colony-PCR using primers yajb-chk-F and yajB-chk-R. Strain JT2 was constructed by using a P1 lysate made on JT1 to transduce SJ16 to chloramphenicol resistance. The acpH- genotype was verified by assaying crude extracts of both strains for AcpH activity as described below.Purification of ACP Species—Holo-ACP was purified using a modified procedure based on the methods described previously (21Keating D.H.

Biochem. 1980; 102: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Strain DK574 (which is SJ16 carrying plasmids pMS421 and pMR19) was grown to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with 15 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for a further 4 h. The cells were pelleted, washed in an equal volume of 50 mm sodium MES, pH 6.1, and concentrated 20-fold in the same buffer. Crude extracts were prepared by sonication and an equal volume of ice-cold isopropyl alcohol was added to the extract and incubated with stirring at 4 °C for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a Vivaspin D column equilibrated to pH 6.1. The column was washed with 25 mm sodium MES, pH 6.1, containing 0.25 m LiCl, and holo-ACP was eluted with 0.5 m LiCl. The protein was concentrated a further 50-fold by precipitation with 0.02% sodium deoxycholate and 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by resuspension in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm DTT overnight. Holo-ACP labeled in the 4′-PP group was purified in the same manner with the following exceptions; strain DK574 was grown overnight in medium containing 0.5 μm β-alanine (a condition that results in growth-limiting coenzyme A levels) followed by subculture into medium containing 8 μm β-[3-3H]alanine (0.125 Ci/mol) and growth for a further 5 h. [3H]ACP was purified from these cultures as described above. The apo form of ACP was obtained as a mixture of the apo and holo forms as above except that strain DK574 was induced with 50 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, which resulted in a greater fraction of apo-ACP (21Keating D.H.

Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reactions contained 1 mm CoA, 10-40 μm apo-ACP, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μm AcpS in a volume of 0.1 ml and were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The conversion to holo-ACP was determined by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis (24Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on 20% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 m urea (25Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol.

(26Shen Z. Fice D. Byers D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm holo-ACP, 80 μm concentrations of each fatty acid, and 50 nm purified Vibrio harveyi acyl-ACP synthetase 5Y. Jiang and J. E. Cronan, manuscript in preparation. in a 50-μl volume and were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Essentially complete conversion to the acylated forms was shown by gel electrophoresis.In Vitro Assay of AcpH Activity—AcpH activity was assayed essentially by the method of Fischl and Kennedy (14Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 25 °C and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.02 mm MnCl2, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10-50 μm acyl carrier protein substrate in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μg of crude extract protein or 1-200 nm purified AcpH and terminated after 60 min by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 6%. The precipitate was washed in 6% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 50 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. 10 μl of this was analyzed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis with detection by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. When analyzed by mass spectrometry, the reaction mixtures were first dialyzed against 2 mm ammonium acetate with two buffer changes and then dried under vacuum. Radioactive AcpH assays were performed under the same conditions except that 15-40 μm [3H]holo-ACP or 3-15 μg of protein from an extract of β-alanine-labeled cells was used as substrate. The reactions were either analyzed by fluorography as described below or by release of the 3H label from the protein quantitated as follows: 30 μl of the trichloroacetic acid supernatant was treated with 200 μl of water-saturated diethyl ether to remove the acid and 20 μl of the aqueous phase was then mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid and counted in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. For fluorography following electrophoresis, the acrylamide gels were fixed in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min then incubated in Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) for a further 30 min and dried at 40 °C. The dried gels were exposed to preflashed X-AR Bio-Max films (Kodak) at -80 °C.Holo-ACP Turnover—Strain SJ16 derivatives were grown in minimal medium containing 0.5 μm β-alanine overnight to reduce the coenzyme A pools. Overnight cultures were subcultured in minimal medium with 0.5 μm [3H]β-alanine (1 Ci/mol) until they reached an A600 of 1.0. Cells were pelleted and washed twice in minimal medium and then diluted 5-fold in the same medium containing 8 μm unlabeled β-alanine. 0.5-ml samples were withdrawn at various time points, and cell extracts were made in 25 mm sodium MES, pH 6.1. Ten μl of each extract was run on 20% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by fluorography as given above.Expression and Purification of C-terminal Hexahistidine-tagged AcpH—Strain BL21 DE3/pJT4 was grown in LB-ampicillin to A600 0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for a further 4 h. The cells were washed in an equal volume of lysis buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and resuspended in one-tenth volume of the same buffer containing 8 m urea. The cell suspension was lysed by shaking at room temperature for 1 h and then centrifuged. AcpH was purified from the supernatant on Ni-NTA-agarose under denaturing conditions as follows. The supernatant was applied to a column of Ni-NTA-agarose resin, and the column was washed and eluted with buffers of the same composition but decreasing pH: wash buffer 1, pH 6.3; wash buffer 2, pH 5.9; and elution buffer, pH 4.5. Fractions were analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, purified AcpH was diluted to a concentration of 10 μg/ml and dialyzed against AcpH storage buffer mentioned above with the addition of 8 m urea and 50 mm each of l-arginine and l-glutamate to prevent aggregation (27Golovanov A.P. Hautbergue G.M. Wilson S.A. Lian L.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8933-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The molar concentration of urea in the arginine-glutamate buffer was decreased stepwise in successive dialysis steps (8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0) for 2 h each followed by overnight dialysis (with three changes of buffer) against the final buffer.Gel Filtration Chromatography—A 5-ml culture of BL21 DE3 transformed with plasmid pJT4 was grown to mid-log phase, treated with 200 μg/ml rifampicin and 42.5 nm l-[35S]methionine (250 μCi) (28Choi-Rhee E. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30806-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The culture was grown for a further 1 h, concentrated 10-fold, and crude extracts were made in column running buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm l-glutamate, and 50 mm l-arginine). The extract was dialyzed against the same buffer with two changes to remove soluble label and 0.1 ml of the dialyzed extract was applied to a Superdex 200 column (1 × 44 cm). 0.5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 65 μl/min and 0.1 ml of each fraction was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid and analyzed for radioactivity in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. The standard proteins were run in the same manner except that 20 μg of each purified protein was applied to the column and the fractions were analyzed by the Bradford assay (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression Cloning of ACP Phosphodiesterase—Because prior attempts at identification of the gene encoding ACP phosphodiesterase by N-terminal sequencing of the enzyme purified >3000-fold from E. coli cell extracts (14Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gave the sequence of an unrelated contaminating protein (AzoR) (15Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46394-46399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it seemed that the phosphodiesterase is a very non-abundant protein. We therefore took a different approach, that of screening a clone bank for plasmid clones that gave increased phosphodiesterase activity in vitro. We had previously used this approach to identify the gene encoding Enterococcus faecalis lipoamidase (19Jiang Y. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As in that study toxicity of the expressed gene seemed likely to be a problem, as high levels of phosphodiesterase activity would be expected to inhibit growth by depletion of holo-ACP pools required for fatty acid synthesis and by increasing the relative amount of apo-ACP, a potent inhibitor of cell growth (21Keating D.H. Carey M.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the same vector system (30Wild J. Hradecna Z. Szybalski W. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1434-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as in the lipoamidase work that has the following features. The vector is a cosmid that carries an F-factor origin of replication (ori2) and partitioning function that maintains the cosmid clones in single copy under uninduced conditions. This alleviates the problem of under-representation of clones carrying genes that are toxic in multiple copies. A second origin of replication, oriV, is also present on the cosmid that requires the TrfA protein for function. The host strain carries a copy-up allele of the trfA gene (30Wild J. Hradecna Z. Szybalski W. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1434-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) integrated into the chromosome under control of a pBAD promoter. Induction with arabinose causes expression of TrfA allowing initiation of replication from the oriV origin to give a 40-80-fold increase in the cosmid copy number. This inducible increase in copy number is useful both to increase yields during isolation of cosmid DNA and more importantly, to increase expression of genes carried on the insert for easier expression-based cloning. In addition, the cosmid contains λcos sites that allow it to be packaged into λ particles in vitro or in vivo. The dependence of λ in vitro packaging on the size of the packaging substrate gives a size selection ensuring that the library comprises only clones containing inserts of ∼40 kb.Sheared E. coli MG1655 DNA was end repaired and ligated into Eco72I-digested pCC1FOS. The ligation mixture was then packaged into λ phage particles and used to infect strain EPI300 giving 3 × 104 chloramphenicol-resistant colonies per ml of packaged ligation mixture. The colonies were grown for 48 h at 37 °C to allow slower growing colonies to reach visible size. We picked a library of 500 colonies because to obtain a given E. coli K12 genome sequence with 99% probability, 461 clones of a 40-kb insert genomic library are required (31Clarke L. Hitzeman R. Carbon J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The library colonies were divided into 10 set"
https://openalex.org/W2127405785,"Most pseudouridinylation in eukaryotic rRNA and small nuclear RNAs is guided by H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs. In this study, the Trypanosoma brucei pseudouridine synthase, Cbf5p, a snoRNP protein, was identified and silenced by RNAi. Depletion of this protein destabilized all small nucleolar RNAs of the H/ACA-like family. Following silencing, defects in rRNA processing, such as accumulation of precursors and inhibition of cleavages to generate the mature rRNA, were observed. snR30, an H/ACA RNA involved in rRNA maturation, was identified based on prototypical conserved domains characteristic of this RNA in other eukaryotes. The silencing of CBF5 also eliminated the spliced leader-associated (SLA1) RNA that directs pseudouridylation on the spliced leader RNA (SL RNA), which is the substrate for the trans-splicing reaction. Surprisingly, the depletion of Cbf5p not only eliminated the pseudouridine on the SL RNA but also abolished capping at the fourth cap-4 nucleotide. As a result of defects in the SL RNA and decreased modification on the U small nuclear RNA, trans-splicing was inhibited at the first step of the reaction, providing evidence for the essential role of H/ACA RNAs and the modifications they guide on trans-splicing.

The rRNA of all eukaryotes undergoes extensive covalent modifications. Post-transcriptional endonucleolytic cleavages of the large pre-rRNA generate the rRNAs, whereas covalent modification takes place co-transcriptionally (1Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These modifications include methylation of the 2′-hydroxyl residue (2′-O-methylation) and isomerization of the uracil to pseudouridine (Ψ). 3The abbreviations used are: Ψ, pseudouridine; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; snoRNP, small nucleolar RNP; SL RNA, spliced leader RNA; SLA1, spliced leader-associated RNA1; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; LSU, large ribosomal RNA subunit; SSU, small ribosomal RNA subunit; srRNA, small rRNA; ITS, internal transcribed spacer; ETS, external transcribed spacer; nt, nucleotide(s); CMC, N-cyclohexyl-N′-β-(4-methylmorpholinium)ethyl-carbodiimide p-tosylate; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; RNAi, RNA interference; TAP, tandem affinity purification; U, uridylic acid-rich. Most of these modifications are guided by site-specific base pairing of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (2Bachellerie J.P. Cavaille J. Huttenhofer A.

Cell. 1997; 89: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The snoRNAs that guide these modifications are designated by their specific sequence motifs; C/D boxed RNA guides the 2′-O-methylation, and H/ACA RNA guides pseudouridylation (6Kiss T. Cell. 2002; 109: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 7Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Most relevant to this study are the H/ACA RNAs (2Bachellerie J.P. Cavaille J. Huttenhofer A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 775-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 3Ganot P. Bortolin M.L.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In most eukaryotes studied so far, the H/ACA snoRNAs are composed of two hairpin domains connected by a single-stranded hinge, the H domain, and a tail region, the ACA box (3Ganot P. Bortolin M.L. Kiss T. Cell. 1997; 89: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Four core proteins (Gar1p, Nop10p, Nhp2p, and Cbf5p/dyskerin) were identified in eukaryotic H/ACA snoRNPs. All of these proteins except Gar1p are essential for snoRNP stability (9Watkins N.J. Gottschalk A. Neubauer G. Kastner B. Fabrizio P. Mann M. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1998; 4: 1549-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Two short rRNA recognition motifs of the snoRNA base-pair with the rRNA sequences flanking the uridine to be converted to pseudouridine. The pseudouridine is always located 14–16 nt upstream from the H or ACA box of the snoRNA (3Ganot P. Bortolin M.L. Kiss T. Cell. 1997; 89: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 5Ni J. Tien A.L. Fournier M.J.

Surprisingly, all of the 34 H/ACA-like RNAs identified in Trypanosoma brucei can form only a single stem-loop structure and carry an AGA instead of ACA box at the 3′ end (10Liang X.H. Uliel S. Hury A. Barth S. Doniger T. Unger R. Michaeli S. RNA. 2005; 11: 619-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These 34 H/ACA RNAs can potentially guide pseudouridylation on 32 rRNA positions (10Liang X.H. Uliel S. Hury A. Barth S. Doniger T. Unger R. Michaeli S. RNA. 2005; 11: 619-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 84 methylations guided by 57 C/D snoRNAs were also identified in the same study, suggesting that trypanosome represents an organism in which the amount of nucleotide modification (2′-O-methylation) may exceed that of Ψs (10Liang X.H. Uliel S. Hury A. Barth S. Doniger T. Unger R. Michaeli S. RNA. 2005; 11: 619-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The most interesting H/ACA-like RNA in trypanosomes is the spliced leader-associated RNA1 (SLA1). This RNA was first discovered based on its efficient cross-linking to the spliced leader RNA (SL RNA) and was proposed at that time to be the U5 snRNA homologue (11Watkins K.P. Dungan J.M. Agabian N. Cell. 1994; 76: 171-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, since the discovery of “authentic” U5 snRNA (12Xu Y. Ben Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Dungan J.M. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Bell M. Bindereif A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3986-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the identity of this RNA has not been resolved. Based on its genomic localization together with C/D snoRNAs and the finding that in trypanosomes both C/D and H/ACA RNA exist in genomic clusters carrying the two type of RNAs, it was proposed that SLA1 is a special H/ACA that directs modification at position –12 with respect to the 5′ splice site on the SL RNA. Indeed, the SLA1/SL RNA interaction domain complies with the canonical rule for guiding pseudouridylation on the SL RNA. Position –12 with respect to the 5′ splice site is pseudouridylated in all of the trypanosomatid SL RNA, and SL RNA mutants that cannot interact with SLA1 by extensive base pairing are not pseudouridylated (15Liang X.H. Xu Y.X. Michaeli S. RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The SLA1 is localized both to the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm (15Liang X.H. Xu Y.X. Michaeli S. RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that pseudouridylation takes place early during SL RNA biogenesis before Sm assembly, since SL RNA synthesized in SmD1-depleted cells was properly pseudouridylated (16Mandelboim M. Barth S. Biton M. Liang X.H. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51469-51478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, SL RNA mutants lacking a U in this conserved position do not show splicing defects (17Mandelboim M. Estrano C.L. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35210-35218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Not all of the H/ACA snoRNAs function in guiding modifications, since several are required for endonucleolytic cleavages of pre-rRNA (19Bally M. Hughes J. Cesareni G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5291-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4169-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). One such RNA is snR30 in yeast and U17 in mammals, which functions early in rRNA maturation (21Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 22Atzorn V. Fragapane P. Kiss T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1769-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). snR30 inactivation in yeast prevents the synthesis of 18 S rRNA, since cleavages at A0, A1, and A2 of the pre-rRNA precursor are inhibited (21Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 22Atzorn V. Fragapane P. Kiss T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1769-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Another special H/ACA-like RNA is telomerase RNA in mammals (23Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Indeed, patients with the disease dyskeratosis cogenita, caused by mutation in the pseudouridine synthase, have reduced telomerase activity and shorter telomeres (24Ruggero D. Grisendi S. Piazza F. Rego E. Mari F. Rao P.H. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 2003; 299: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about trypanosome rRNA maturation. This process seems to differ from maturation in other eukaryotes. The small subunit rRNA (SSU) in trypanosomes is the largest one known so far, and the large subunit rRNA (LSU) is processed into six fragments (25Campbell D.A. Kubo K. Clark C.G. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26White T.C. Rudenko G. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9471-9489Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whereas in most eukaryotes, the first cleavage of LSU is in the 5′ external transcribed spacer (5′ ETS), in T. brucei the first cleavage takes place at the internal transcribed spacer, ITS1 (position B1), that separates the pre-SSU from the pre-LSU (27Hartshorne T. Toyofuku W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cleavages at the 5′ ETS in sites A′, A0, and A1 generate the 5′ end SSU rRNA. The only trypanosome snoRNA involved in rRNA maturation identified so far is U3 (27Hartshorne T. Toyofuku W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Hartshorne T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2541-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Hartshorne T. Toyofuku W. Hollenbaugh J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 733-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The T. brucei U3 snoRNA is unique in having three 5′ ETS complementary sequences, two of which are essential for SSU production (30Hartshorne T. Toyofuku W. Hollenbaugh J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 733-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CBF5, the pseudouridine synthase of the H/ACA snoRNP, is essential in yeast, mostly because it is required for stabilizing H/ACA RNAs that are essential for rRNA endonucleolytic cleavages (31Lafontaine D.L. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Note that most of the snoRNAs that direct modification are not essential for viability (5Ni J. Tien A.L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4169-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recent studies in rats demonstrate that mutation in Cbf5p elicits the disease dyskeratosis cogenita. This disease, introduced above, is characterized by premature aging and increased tumor susceptibility. The study further suggests that all of the defects associated with this disease appear before the defects in telomere length caused by reduced telomerase activity, suggesting that deregulated ribosome function is important for the onset of the disease (24Ruggero D. Grisendi S. Piazza F. Rego E. Mari F. Rao P.H. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 2003; 299: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Little is known about the linkage between RNA modification and splicing, compared with rRNA maturation. Modifications on U2 snRNA are essential for U2 snRNP biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing in Xenopous oocytes (32Yu Y.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5783-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and mammals (33Donmez G. Hartmuth K. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The pseudouridine at the U2 snRNA domain that interacts by base pairing with the pre-mRNA not only stabilizes the branch point interaction as compared with an unmodified uridine, but the pseudouridine induces a structural change in the RNA that helps to position the branch site adenosine more precisely for recognition and subsequent activity in splicing (34Newby M.I. Greenbaum N.L. RNA. 2001; 7: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect of depletion of H/ACA-like RNA on RNA maturation was studied upon silencing CBF5 by RNAi in T. brucei. The gene is essential for viability, and its depletion elicited major defects in rRNA maturation. The first trypanosome H/ACA RNA involved in rRNA maturation, the snR30 homologue, was identified in this study, and the defects in rRNA maturation during CBF5 silencing can be attributed in part to its absence. As opposed to the well documented effect of CBF5 depletion on rRNA maturation and modification, this study also describes defects in trans-splicing associated with the Cbf5p depletion. The defects in trans-splicing may stem from the elimination of SLA1, which has a critical role as an SL RNA chaperone during SL RNA biogenesis as well as from effects on the modification of snRNAs. As in mammals, and as opposed to yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pseudouridylation on U snRNAs in trypanosomes is carried out in part by H/ACA RNAs. This is the first system to demonstrate the direct and essential role of H/ACA RNA in trans-splicing. All of the oligonucleotides were specific for T. brucei. Oligonucleotides for the Silencing Construct—0924 (5′-CCG CTC GAG TGA GGC ACA ACG TAA AGA GG-3′, sense) from position 21 to 40 of the Cbf5 coding region, including the XhoI site (underlined), was used for PCR amplification of the 480 bp for cloning into the pZJM vector (35Wang Z.

Oligonucleotides Used for Northern Analysis of Tubulin mRNA—Tubulin-3A (5′-ATG CAG ATA GCC TCA CGC-3′, antisense) was complementary to the α-tubulin gene, from position 3 to 20, relative to the start codon. Cell Growth and Transfection—Procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13 (obtained from the laboratory of Paul England, a gift from George Cross laboratory), which carries integrated genes for T7 polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, was grown in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml G418. Cells were transfected as previously described (16Mandelboim M. Barth S. Biton M. Liang X.H. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51469-51478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For cloning, the transfected cells were diluted onto microtiter plates in the presence of the parental T. brucei 29-13, which served as feeder cells. Next, the microtiter plate was incubated in a humid chamber at 27 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 2–3 weeks, clonal populations were obtained in the microtiter plates, and the cells were transferred to medium for propagation. Cells from cultures that showed typical growth arrest upon tetracycline induction were grown and frozen. Every 2 weeks, a new culture was started from the original frozen stock. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Sigma), and 20 μg/lane was fractionated on a 1.2%/0.8% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel. The RNA was visualized with ethidium bromide. The CBF5 and tubulin mRNAs were detected with randomly labeled probes (Random Primer DNA Labeling Mix, Biological Industries Co.). rRNA subunits were detected with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides. For analyzing small rRNAs (srRNAs), total RNA was fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond; Amersham Biosciences) and probed with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides. Primer Extension and Mapping the Pseudouridine on the SL RNA, U2 snRNA, and rRNA—Primer extension was performed as described previously (12Xu Y. Ben Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Total RNA (5–105 μg) was used in a primer extension reaction with 1 × 10 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide. For determining the ψ on the SL RNA, U2 snRNA, and rRNA, RNA from 5 × 108 cells was treated with 50 μl of N-cyclohexyl-N′-β-(4-methylmorpholinium)ethyl-carbodiimide p-tosylate (CMC) buffer composed of (0.17 m CMC, 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, 4 mm EDTA, 7 m urea) at 37 °C for 20 min. To remove the CMC groups, the CMC-treated RNA was subjected to alkali hydrolysis with 80 μl of Na2CO3 (50 mm, pH 10.4) at 37 °C for 4 h (rRNA) or 2 h (snRNAs), as previously described (37Bakin A.V. Ofengand J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar). The treated RNA (15 μg) was used as a template in primer extension analysis. In this method, the reverse transcriptase stops 1 nt before the modified base (15Liang X.H. Xu Y.X. Michaeli S. RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37Bakin A.V. Ofengand J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar). TAP Tag Purification—The T. brucei cell line, 29-13, co-expressing the Tet repressor and T7 RNA polymerase, was transfected with NotI-linearized pLew79-Nhp2pTAP plasmid coding for the Nhp2p-TAP-tagged protein under the control of tetracycline and carrying the phleomycin resistance gene (38Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Palazzo S.S. O'Rear J. Salavati R. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Expression of Nhp2p-TAP in the transgenic cell line was induced for 72 h with tetracycline (0.1 μg/ml). Cells (1 liter, 107 cells/ml) were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Next, 1% Triton X-100 was added, and the extract was incubated on ice for 20 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was subjected to affinity selection using IgG-Sepharose beads for 2 h. RNA was extracted from the beads with TRIzol (Sigma) reagent and was subjected to primer extension analysis with specific probes. Silencing of CBF5 Suggests That the Gene Is Essential for Growth—To elucidate the role of H/ACA RNA in RNA maturation and especially to better understand the role of SLA1 in trans-splicing, the trypanosome CBF5 homologue was identified in the T. brucei genome (Tb10.100.0060). The putative protein is 427 amino acids in length. The first ∼310 residues share 61% identity with the mammalian NAP57 and 65% identity with the yeast Cbf5p. The N terminus of the trypanosome protein is shorter than its homologous proteins in metazoa and plants by ∼20 amino acids, and the trypanosome sequence lacks the highly charged region that is found mainly in mammalian and fly proteins. In yeast, the C terminus of Cbf5p is composed of highly charged amino acids, and 67 of the 83 residues are either Asp, Glu, Lys, or Arg (30 are Asp/Glu, and 37 are Arg/Lys), including 10 consecutive KK(E/D) repeats (indicated in purple in supplemental Fig. 1S). The fly protein does not have KK(E/D) repeats, but 45 of the last 73 amino acids are Asp, Glu, Lys, or Arg (22 are Asp/Glu, and 23 are Arg/Lys) (39Phillips B. Billin A.N. Cadwell C. Buchholz R. Erickson C. Merriam J.R. Carbon J. Poole S.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The trypanosome C terminus, on the other hand, is weakly charged; it carries 25 conserved amino acids but only 5 Asp/Glu and 5 Arg/Lys. These amino acids are probably involved in centromere binding activity, since S. cerevisiae expressing a C-terminal truncated CBF5 gene lacking the KK(E/D) repeats showed a delay at G2/M arrest, which links this protein with function in cell cycle control, most probably via its effects on centromeres. In addition, CBF5 lacking these repeats also failed to bind microtubules in vitro (40Jiang W. Middleton K. Yoon H.J. Fouquet C. Carbon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4884-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of specific amino acids in the C-terminal region of the Aspergillus nidulans homologue affects the polar growth of these cells but not pseudouridylation or rRNA maturation, also suggesting that this region of the protein is involved in centromere binding (41Lin X. Momany M. Genetics. 2003; 165: 543-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of the charged domains in both the N terminus and C terminus of the trypanosome protein suggests that the trypanosome protein may not be associated with centromere function as it is in other eukaryotes but rather mainly functions in pseudouridylation and RNA maturation. To elucidate the function of the trypanosome CBF5, the gene was silenced by RNAi. To silence the gene, a construct that is expressed from the T7 opposing cassette was prepared (35Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A 480-bp fragment was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the pJZM vector (35Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Since one of the characteristics of the T7 opposing system is its instability, especially under prolonged culture, a stem-loop silencing construct was also prepared, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The constructs were linearized for integration into the nontranscribed rRNA spacer region, and clonal populations were prepared, as previously described (16Mandelboim M. Barth S. Biton M. Liang X.H. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51469-51478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After 3 weeks, the cloned cells were used to establish a pure culture. A typical growth curve of the silenced cells carrying the stem-loop construct is presented in Fig. 1. Four days after tetracycline induction at 26 °C, the cells stopped growing. Interestingly, during culture at 37 °C, growth arrest occurred sooner and to a greater degree (Fig. 1B). Such a phenotype was not observed in yeast depleted of this protein (31Lafontaine D.L. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), suggesting that the growth inhibition at the restrictive temperature may stem from the effect of the depletion on splicing (see below). The clear growth arrest upon silencing suggests that CBF5 is an essential gene in trypanosomes, as was demonstrated in yeast (31Lafontaine D.L. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate the relationship between growth arrest and silencing of these genes, the level of CBF5 mRNA was examined upon silencing. The results in Fig. 2 suggest that in both silenced cell lines using the T7 opposing system (Fig. 2A) and the stem-loop silencing (Fig. 2B), the mRNA was eliminated as early as 2 days after silencing. Since the size of the CBF5 mRNA overlaps tha"

The yeast Pex14 protein together with Pex13p and Pex17p form the docking subcomplex at the peroxisomal membrane and interact in this cycle with both soluble import receptors Pex5p and Pex7p. In a first step of a structure-function analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex14p, we mapped its binding sites with both receptors. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and pull-down assays, we showed that Pex5p directly interacts with two separate regions of ScPex14p, amino acid residues 1-58 and 235-308. The latter binding site at the C terminus of ScPex14p overlaps with a binding site of Pex7p at amino acid residues 235-325. The functional assessment of these two binding sites of ScPex14p with the peroxisomal targeting signal receptors indicates that they have distinct roles. Deletion of the N-terminal 58 amino acids caused a partial defect of matrix protein import in pex14Δ cells expressing the Pex14-(59-341)-p fragment; however, it did not lead to a pex phenotype. In contrast, truncation of the C-terminal 106 amino acids of ScPex14p completely blocked this process. On the basis of these and other published data, we propose that the C terminus of Pex14p contains the actual docking site and discuss the possibility that the N terminus could be involved in a Pex5p-Pex14p association inside the peroxisomal membrane.

Peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported post-translationally across the peroxisomal membrane as folded or even oligomeric proteins (1Brown L.A. Baker A. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Eckert J.H. Erdmann R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 75-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The identities of the proteins collectively called peroxins (which are required for this process) are known, but their precise roles are not well characterized (2Eckert J.H. Erdmann R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 75-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Current evidence favors a cycling receptor model for this process (3Kunau W. Curr.

After releasing their cargo, the receptors recycle to the cytosol for additional rounds of import. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins possess one of two evolutionarily conserved PTSs, the C-terminal PTS1 or the N-terminal PTS2, which are specifically recognized by Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively (1Brown L.A. Baker A. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Eckert J.H. Erdmann R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 75-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).A crucial step of the receptor cycle, which could provide directionality to the process, is the docking event at the peroxisomal membrane (1Brown L.A. Baker A. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Eckert J.H. Erdmann R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 75-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies from several laboratories provide evidence that Pex14p is the central component of a docking complex, which also contains Pex17p and Pex13p. As Pex14p interacts with several other membrane-bound proteins in addition to both PTS receptors, it has been proposed to be the point of convergence of the two peroxisomal import pathways (6Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).There are conflicting data concerning the nature of the association of Pex14p with the peroxisomal membrane, and the topology of the protein is still not entirely solved. Although we originally report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex14p is extractable with carbonate (6Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H.

Rattus norvegicus Pex14p was found to be tightly associated with a fraction of Pex5p that behaves as an integral membrane protein (13Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E.

It was shown that the first 130 amino acids of Pex14p are highly protected from exogenously added protease by the peroxisomal membrane and that this domain is responsible for the strong interaction of Pex14p with the organelle membrane (12Oliveira M.E.

Unexpectedly, two separate and functionally different binding sites were found for the PTS receptor Pex5p, one in each of the two termini. The C-terminal binding site overlapped with a single binding site determined for Pex7p and was essential for matrix protein import. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal binding site reduced the efficiency but did not abolish matrix protein import. We proposed a model in which the cytosolically exposed C terminus of Pex14p served as the actual docking site and in which the N terminus could be involved in a Pex14p-Pex5p association inside the peroxisomal membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Culture Conditions—The S. cerevisiae wild-type strain used in this study was UTL-7A (14Erdmann R.

Yeast complete (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) and minimal media (SD) have been described previously (15Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To delete PEX14, the kanMX4 gene was used as a selective marker for insertion into the genomic locus (16Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Deletion cassettes containing the kanMX4 gene and the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of the Pex14p-ORF (open reading frame) were constructed by PCR using pFA6a-kanMX4 (16Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R.

To produce anti-Pex14-(1-58)-p antibodies, Pex14-(1-58)-p-His6 was isolated using Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Pex14-(1-58)-p-His6 was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. For induction, 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was introduced. After lysis by French press in a 3× volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), a centrifugation step of 25,000 × g for 30 min followed. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and supplied to a 1.2-ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. After washing using a 20× volume of washing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole), bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 m imidazole) in 1-ml fractions. As protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin were used. Fractions containing the fusion protein were used to immunize a rabbit.Anti-rabbit IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the secondary antibody. Immunoreactive complexes were visualized using anti-rabbit IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase in combination with the ECL™ system from Amersham Biosciences.

Myc-Pex7p overexpression in pex14Δ cells was induced by the addition of 100 mg of CuSO4·5H2O/liter of culture containing 2% glucose. For the analysis of the interaction between Pex5p and Pex14-(1-58)-p-His6 as well as the binding of GST-Pex14-(235-341)-p to Myc-Pex7p, 0.2 g of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing Pex14-(1-58)-p-His6, GST-Pex14-(235-341)-p, GST, 0.3 g of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing Pex5p, and 1 g of pex14Δ yeast cells overexpressing Myc-Pex7p were resuspended in a 3× volume of lysis buffer (for Ni2+-NTA columns, 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole; for GSH-Sepharose columns, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100). Cells were lysed by the addition of a 4× volume of glass beads (℘ 0.5 mm) and vortexing 10 times for 1 min each. Glass beads, cell debris, and unlysed cells were sedimented by a centrifugation step at 1500 × g for 5 min. Thereafter, E. coli lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 88,000 × g and yeast lysates for 30 min at 200,000 × g to pellet insoluble material. Supernatants were mixed and incubated with 100 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) or 100 μl of GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) as needed for 2 h at 4°C. The resin columns were collected in minispin columns (MobiTec). The Ni2+-NTA-agarose was washed 10 times using 200 μl of lysis buffer, followed by 10 times using 100 μl of 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, 10 times using 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 40 mm imidazole, and 10 times using 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole. Elution was carried out using 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 m imidazole. Every two fractions were pooled before analysis. The GSH-Sepharose was washed 10 times using 200 μl of lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with lysis buffer enriched with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Every two fractions were pooled before analysis. As protease inhibitors 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin were used.For the analysis of the binding between GST-Pex14-(235-341)-p and Pex5p, 2 g of cells expressing one or the other fusion protein or GST were used. Lysis buffer did not contain Triton X-100 but 1 mm dithiothreitol. As protease inhibitors, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 200 μm Pefabloc SC, 5 mm benzamidine, and 5 mm NaF were used. Cells were lysed using a French pressure cell press. Soluble fractions were obtained by centrifugation as described above, mixed, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h before they were subjected to columns with 0.8 ml of GSH-Sepharose. Washing was performed using 32 ml of lysis buffer. Recovered proteins were eluted with 16 ml of lysis buffer enriched with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 0.5-ml fractions.Cell Fractionation—Spheroplasting of yeast cells, homogenization, and differential centrifugation at 25,000 × g of homogenates were performed as described previously (15Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).For separation of cell organelles by density gradient centrifugation, post-nuclear supernatants of wild-type and mutant strains were loaded onto continuous 20-53% (w/v) sucrose density gradients (25 ml). The gradient buffer contained 5 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) ethanol/KOH, pH 6.0, at 4 °C. After a centrifugation step of 1.5 h (Sorvall-SV288, 19,500 rpm), ∼30 fractions of 1 ml each were collected. 500 μl of each fraction of any gradient were processed for Western blotting using trichloroacetic acid, whereas the other part was used for enzyme measurements.The suborganellar localization of proteins was determined by extraction of 25,000 × g organelle pellets by either high salt treatment with buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or using carbonate buffer containing 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the samples were spun for 1 h at 200,000 × g through a cushion of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 250 mm sucrose.Enzyme Assays—Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) and cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) were assayed according to published procedures (25Baudhuin P.

Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). The open reading frames or coding regions of specific fragments of PEX genes were fused to the DNA binding domain or transcription-activating domain of GAL4 into the vectors pPC86 and pPC97 (17Chevray P.M.

We used the yeast two-hybrid system and first tested N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of Pex14p for the binding of Pex5p. The short N-terminal fragment Pex14-(1-58)-p was chosen because it comprises the most conserved region of Pex14 proteins (data not shown), and Schliebs et al. reports that the analogous region of human Pex14p directly binds HsPex5p (32Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As expected, Pex14-(1-58)-p did interact with the PTS1 receptor (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the complementary fragment Pex14-(59-341)-p, which was actually meant as a control, also interacted with the PTS1 receptor. To test whether ScPex14p contains two separate binding sites of Pex5p, we used a series of N-terminal deletions and found that the C-terminal fragment Pex14-(235-341)-p interacts with Pex5p, whereas the core fragment Pex14-(59-234)-p missing both termini does not (Fig. 1A). In addition, we verified the interaction of both termini of Pex14p with the PTS1 receptor using an in vitro assay. For this purpose, Pex14-(1-58)-p and Pex14-(235-341)-p (fused to a His6 or GST tag, respectively) and Pex5p (without any tag) were expressed in E. coli. Both recombinant Pex14p fragments clearly bound Pex5p, whereas this was not the case in the controls (Fig. 2, A and B). These data strongly indicated the existence of two separate direct Pex5p binding sites on ScPex14p, one in the N-terminal 58 amino acid residues and one in the last 106 amino acid residues.FIGURE 2In vitro binding assay. The binding of Pex14-(1-58)-p-His6 and GST-Pex14-(235-341)-p to Pex5p or Pex7p was studied in vitro by pull-down experiments. Soluble fractions of BL21(DE3) cells heterologously expressing Pex5p, Pex14-(1-58)-p-His6, GST-Pex14-(235-341)-p, GST, or no host protein as well as soluble fractions of yeast cells overexpressing Myc-Pex7p were mixed as indicated and incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (A) or GSH-Sepharose (B and C). Recovered proteins of the elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-Pex5p and anti-Pex14p antibodies (A), antibodies against Pex5p and GST (B), or anti-Pex14p antibodies and antibodies against the Myc epitope (C). Direct binding of Pex5p to the N and C termini of Pex14p as well as an interaction of Pex7p with the C terminus of Pex14p are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The C Terminus of Pex14p Also Interacts with Pex7p—To determine the binding region of Pex7p, we assayed the same truncated versions of ScPex14p as described above using again the two-hybrid system. Fig. 1B shows that the C-terminal fragment Pex14-(235-341)-p (which contains a binding site of the PTS1 receptor) also interacts with the PTS2 receptor. All other ScPex14p fragments did not bind to Pex7p (Fig. 1B; data not shown). An analogous pull-down experiment as described above for the binding of Pex5p (Fig. 2, A and B) was carried out with Myc-Pex7p and GST-Pex14-(235-341)-p. As Myc-Pex7p could not be stably overexpressed in E. coli, a yeast lysate containing Myc-Pex7p but no wild-type Pex14p was used. The results shown in Fig. 2C demonstrate the specific interaction of the PTS2 receptor with the C terminus of Pex14p. These data suggest that, although Pex5p directly interacts with ScPex14p through two distinct regions, Pex7p possesses only one binding site in the C terminus of Pex14p.To determine whether Pex5p and Pex7p bind to the same amino acid sequence within the C terminus of ScPex14p, we shortened the Pex14-(235-341)-p fragment further on both ends and tested these constructs in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The results (Fig. 1C) can be summarized in two points. First, the smallest fragment that interacted with Pex7p was Pex14-(235-325)-p. Second, Pex5p binds to the even smaller regions Pex14-(235-308)-p and Pex14-(250-341)-p. In conclusion, the amino acid residues in the C terminus of ScPex14p that interact with the two PTS receptors overlap, but they are not identical.Deletion of the N-terminal 58 Amino Acid Residues of ScPex14p Leads to a Partial Import Defect—The overall import activity of ScPex14p can be assayed by the ability of pex14Δ cells expressing wild-type Pex14p to grow on oleate as the sole energy and carbon source or by determining the presence and/or properties of peroxisomes using electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and cell fractionation. All of these techniques were used to assess the functional significance of the identified PTS receptor binding sites within ScPex14p.We first tested pex14Δ cells expressing Pex14p without the N-terminal 58 amino acid residues under the endogenous promoter of Pex14p. The steady state concentration of this fragment in these cells was similar to that of Pex14p in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). We observed that pex14Δ cells expressing the N-terminal deletion mutant Pex14-(59-341)-p grew significantly less efficiently on oleate than wild-type cells (Fig. 3C) but that they do contain peroxisomes, which according to their morphology and size, are indistinguishable from those of cells expressing wild-type Pex14p (Fig. 4). As the reduced ability to grow on oleate suggested a partial impairment of the protein import, we explored this possibility in more detail. Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation studies clearly confirmed this assumption for both the PTS1 and surprisingly the PTS2 import pathway. Antibodies against the PTS1 protein Pcs60p and the PTS2 protein thiolase revealed, besides a punctate immunofluorescence pattern, also a distribution of both proteins over the entire range of cells (Fig. 5). Moreover, differential centrifugation experiments showed that catalase and thiolase could only partially be pelleted with the peroxisomes at 25,000 × g, and significant portions were found in the supernatant fractions (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the same result was obtained with Fox1p (Acyl-CoA oxidase). This protein possesses neither a PTS1 nor a PTS2, but as recently shown, its import is nevertheless dependent on Pex5p (20Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell.

Proteomic analysis was then carried out to identify the interacting proteins. In addition to the detection of two known CaM-KI substrates (CREB and synapsin I), we identified two Numb family proteins (Numb and Numbl) from rat tissues. These proteins were unphosphorylated and were bound only to the Thr177-phosphorylated CaM-KI catalytic domain. This finding is consistent with the results demonstrating that Numb and Numbl were efficiently and stoichiometrically phosphorylated in vitro at equivalent Ser residues (Ser264 in Numb and Ser304 in Numbl) by activated CaM-KI and also by two other CaM-Ks (CaM-KII and CaM-KIV). Using anti-phospho-Numb/Numbl antibody, we observed the phosphorylation of Numb family proteins in various rat tissue extracts, and we also detected the ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of endogenous Numb at Ser264 in COS-7 cells. The present results revealed that the Numb family proteins are phosphorylated in vivo as well as in vitro. Furthermore, we found that the recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins was the functional consequence of the phosphorylation of the Numb family proteins. Interaction of 14-3-3 protein with phosphorylated Numbl-blocked dephosphorylation of Ser304. Taken together, these results indicate that the Numb family proteins may be intracellular targets for CaM-Ks, and they may also be regulated by phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3 protein.

These findings suggest that CaM-KI may play various roles throughout cells (i.e. from the cell membrane to the nucleus). CaM-KI is also conserved among various species, including Aspergillus nidulans (3Joseph J.D. Means A.R. J. Biol.

CaM-KI is part of a protein kinase cascade, referred to as a CaM-K cascade. Full activation of CaM-KI requires the phosphorylation of Thr177 in the activation loop by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM-KK) and Ca2+/CaM binding (20Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol.

It has been shown that Thr177 phosphorylation results in a large increase in the affinity of CaM-KI for its substrate and that Ca2+/CaM binding is required for the release of the autoinhibitory domain from the catalytic core (19Eto K.

Whereas a number of protein substrates for CaM-KI have been identified (e.g. synapsin I and II (11Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), the physiological role of the CaM-KI cascade remains uncertain. To evaluate the physiological functions of the CaM-KK/CaM-KI cascade, it is clearly important to identify the substrates for CaM-KI. A recent study using phosphorylation screening of a cDNA expression library identified novel substrates such as translation initiation factor 4GII; hence, the phosphorylation screening approach may continue to identify additional physiological substrates of CaM-KI (28Qin H. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48570-48579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To search for CaM-KI substrates, in this study we developed a functional proteomic method using affinity chromatography with the CaM-KI catalytic domain (CD) as a ligand to partially purify CaM-KI-CD-interacting proteins; we combined this approach with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis for the identification of substrates. In addition to the identification of two known CaM-KI substrates (synapsin I and CREB) with this method, we identified rat Numbl and Numb, which were bound to the phosphorylated CaM-KI CD at Thr177, and demonstrated that both Numb family proteins are excellent substrates for activated CaM-KI. Furthermore, we characterized the phosphorylation of these Numb family proteins in vitro and in vivo, including their phosphorylation-dependent interactions with 14-3-3 protein. Materials—GST-CaM-KI (residues 1–293, K49E) was constructed as previously described (30Tokumitsu H. Muramatsu M. Ikura M. Kobayashi R. J. Biol.

Anti-phospho-CaM-KI at Thr177 monoclonal antibody was generated as previously described (32Tokumitsu H. Hatano N. Inuzuka H. Yokokura S. Nozaki N. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40296-40302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-CaM-KI and anti-CaM-KK antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Anti-α-tubulin, anti-HSP-70, anti-CREB, and anti-synapsin I antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, MBL International, New England Biolabs, and Chemicon International, respectively. Anti-phospho-CREB antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs. Anti-Numbl and anti-Numb antibodies were purchased from Abcam Ltd. (Cambridge, UK) and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Anti-phospho-Numb/Numbl monoclonal antibody was generated against the synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 295–314 (CPLEQLVRQGpSFRGFPALSQK; where pS represents phosphoserine) of rat Numbl. The phosphopeptide was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the N terminus cysteine and was injected into Balb/c mice as described previously (34Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were obtained from standard commercial sources. Affinity chromatography—GST-CaM-KI (residues 1–293, K49E) (2.5 mg) was phosphorylated with 3 μg of recombinant rat CaM-KKα at 30°C for 2 h in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg CaM, and 1 mm ATP. Then either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GST-CaM-KI (residues 1–293, K49E) (2.5 mg) or GST (1 mg) was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (250-μl bed volume; Amersham Biosciences), and then the columns were washed with 10 ml of Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA). Three fresh whole rat brains and 10 g of fresh rat liver were separately homogenized with 30 ml of Buffer A containing 1 μm microcystin LR and 0.5 μm okadaic acid (Buffer B), followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (10 ml) was applied to each Sepharose column as described above, followed by washing with 50 ml of Buffer B. The proteins that interacted with GST-CaM-KI (residues 1–293, K49E) were eluted by adding 250 μl of Buffer A containing 30 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) to each Sepharose resin, followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Twenty-five microliters of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the eluate, and then each sample was stored at –30 °C until analysis by mass spectrometry or Western blotting. GST-Numb fragment (residues 238–304, 1.5 mg) was phosphorylated with activated CaM-KI (2.1 μg) in the presence of 2 μm CaM and 2 mm ATP in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT. Then either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GST-Numb fragment (residues 238–304) was applied to glutathione-Sepharose columns (250-μl bed volume), and then the columns were washed with 10 ml of Buffer A. Affinity purification of Numb-interacting proteins using the affinity resins in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors was performed according to essentially the same protocol as that used for the affinity purification of CaM-KI-interacting proteins described above. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—A 30-μl sample of the eluate from the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated GST-CaM-KI (residues 1–293, K49E)-coupled glutathione-Sepharose columns described above was separated by SDS-10% PAGE and lightly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Then 16 gel slices were excised from each sample lane in the ∼35–250-kDa range, followed by in-gel digestion with 10 μg/ml trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37 °C (44Kikuchi M. Hatano N. Yokota S. Shimozawa N. Imanaka T. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 421-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The digested peptides were eluted with 0.1% formic acid and were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q-Tof2 quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) interfaced with capillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography (Micromass CapLC™ system). A 90-min linear gradient from 5 to 45% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid was produced and was split at a 1:20 ratio; the gradient solution was then injected into a nano-LC column (PepMap C18, 75 μm × 150 mm; LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) at 25 nl/min. The eluted peptides were sprayed directly into the mass spectrometer. The MS/MS data were acquired by MassLynx software (Micromass) and converted to a single text file (containing the observed m/z of the precursor peptide, the fragment ion m/z, and intensity values) by Protein-Lynx software (Micromass). The file was analyzed with the Mascot MS/MS Ions Search (Matrix Science; available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com) to search and assign the obtained peptides to the NCBI nonredundant data base. We set the search parameters as follows: data base, NCBInr; taxonomy, all; enzyme, trypsin; fixed modifications, carbamidomethyl (C); variable modifications, oxidation (M); peptide tolerance, ±0.2 Da; MS/MS tolerance, ±0.2 Da. LC-MS/MS was used to identify the phosphorylation site of the Numbl protein, as previously described (35Tokumitsu H. Hatano N. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Smith J.L. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of phosphorylated recombinant GST-Numbl were separated by SDS-10% PAGE. The following steps were then performed as described above, with two exceptions. First, in-gel digestion was performed with 17 μg/ml chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Sciences) overnight at 25 °C; second, the search parameters were as follows: data base, GST-rat Numbl-Hisx6 (868 amino acid residues); enzyme, all; variable modification, oxidation (M) and phospho-Ser/Thr; peptide tolerance, ±0.1 Da; and MS/MS tolerance, ±0.1 Da. As regards the identification of Numb-binding proteins, the protein bands of interest were excised from the gel, and in-gel digestion with trypsin (Promega) was performed as described above. The resulting peptides were desalted using a ZipTip μC18 (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Peptides were eluted with 1 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) prepared in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then the peptides were spotted onto a stainless steel target plate. The protein digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using the Voyager DE-STR system (Applied Biosystems). Calibration was performed using the autodigestion peaks of trypsin (1045.5642 and 2211.1046). The observed m/z values were submitted to MS-Fit (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu/ucs-fhtml4.0/msfit.htm) for mass fingerprint searching. We set the search parameters as follows: data base, NCBInr; digest, trypsin; maximum number of missed cleavages, 1; Cys modified by, carbamidomethylation; possible modifications mode, none; minimum number of peptides required to match, 4; mass tolerance, 25 ppm. Cloning and Construction of Rat Numbl and Numb cDNAs—Rat Numbl cDNA (accession number AB210107) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) using rat brain cDNA (Invitrogen) as a template (sense primer 5′-CGTCAGATCGAGCCGCCGCCACCACAGCAG-3′, derived from the 5′-untranslated region in the cDNA sequence in the data base (XP_218360), and antisense primer 5′-GGCAAGCACAGCATTGGCAGTGAACACAGC-3′, derived from the genomic sequence in rat chromosome 1). The initial PCR was followed by a second PCR, using sense primer 5′-GGTCTAGAGATGTCCCGCAGCGCGGCGGCC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGCTCGAGCTACAGTTCAATCTCGAAGGTC-3′ (where underlines indicate nucleotide sequences of restriction sites). Rat Numb cDNA (accession number AB210108) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara) using rat brain cDNA (Invitrogen) as a template (sense primer, 5′-CTGTGTCTCCAGGTTGTAAAAGTTAAC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCTTGCCTAAGGACAGAAAGAACCATC-3′; both primers were from the genomic sequence in rat chromosome 6). This latter PCR was followed by a second PCR, using sense primer 5′-GGTCTAGACATGAACAAACTACGGCAGAGTTTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CCCTCGAGCTAAAGCTCTATTTCAAATGCC-3′, both of which were derived from the data base (XP_234394). The PCR fragments were subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI site of the pGEX-KG-PreS vector. To insert a His6 tag at the C-terminal end of GST-Numbl and also at that of Numb, we inserted annealed oligonucleotides (5′-GAAGTTCTGTTCCAGGGGCCCGAGCACCACCACCACCACCACTGAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCTCGGGCCCCTGGAACAGAACTTC-3′) encoding EVLFQGPEHHHHHH after Leu617 in GST-Numbl (pGEX-KG-PreS-Numbl-His6) or after Leu592 in GST-Numb (pGEX-KG-PreS-Numb-His6). The S304A mutant of pGEX-KG-PreS-Numbl-His6 and the S264A mutant of pGEX-KG-PreS-Numbl-His6 were created by site-directed mutagenesis (GeneEditor™; Promega) using each mutagenic oligonucleotide. An expression plasmid for GST-fused Numb 238–304 was constructed by PCR using sense primer 5′-GGTCTAGAGACTGCTTCTTTAGAGATGAAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGATCCACGCGGAACCAGTGTGTTTTTTATTGGGAA-3′, followed by ligation into the XbaI/XhoI sites of pGEX-KG-PreS together with the annealed oligonucleotides encoding the His6 tag, as described above. The C-terminal FLAG-tagged Numbl (pME-Numbl-FLAG) was constructed by PCR using wild type or a S304A mutant Numbl cDNA as a template and antisense primer (5′-CCTCTAGACTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCAGTTCAATCTCGAAGGTCTTCTGC-3′) containing a region encoding the FLAG epitope, and then the PCR fragment was subcloned into pME18s vector (DNAX Research Institute, Inc.). The nucleotide sequences of all constructs used in this study were confirmed by an ABI377 automated sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Purification of GST-Numbl and GST-Numb—cDNAs carrying GST-fused rat Numbl, Numb, and Numb fragment (pGEX-KG-PreS-Numbl-His6, pGEX-KG-PreS-Numb-His6, and pGEX-KG-PreS-Numb 238–304-His6), including S304A (Numbl) and S264A (Numb) mutants, were introduced into E. coli JM-109, and expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. An E. coli pellet containing GST fusion protein was lysed with PBS, followed by purification using glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography, as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Further purification was then carried out by using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column chromatography (Qiagen) to obtain GST-fused proteins containing full-length Numbl and Numb. Full-length Numb and Numbl were prepared by the cleavage of GST-Numb and GST-Numbl with PreScission protease. Phosphorylation of Rat Numbl and Numb in Vitro—Purified recombinant CaM-KI (0.1 mg/ml) or CaM-KIV (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with or without CaM-KKα (3 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 20 min in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 μm CaM, and 200 μm of ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and terminated by a 10-fold dilution with ice-cold 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% ethylene glycol, and 2 mm EDTA. Small aliquots of CaM-KK-treated (activated) and CaM-KK-untreated (unactivated) CaM-KI or CaM-KIV were stored at –80 °C until used. Purified GST-Numbl, GST-Numb, Numbl, or Numb was incubated without or with unactivated or activated CaM-KI (10 ng) or other protein kinases at 30 °C for the indicated periods in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 μm CaM, and either 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 cpm/pmol) or 200μm ATP for mass spectrometry analysis or Western blotting. Ca2+/CaM was omitted for PKA phosphorylation. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by either Western blot analysis, autoradiography, or quantification of 32P incorporation into the GST-Numbl by Cerenkov counting of the excised gels. Phosphorylation of Endogenous Numb in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were subcultured in 6-well dishes and then were further cultured in serum-free medium for 22 h, and then the cells were treated with or without 1 μm ionomycin for the indicated period of time. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 150 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then the whole cell lysates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, 20 μl of each sample was subjected to SDS-10% PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using antiphospho-Numb/Numbl antibody. Preparation of Rat Tissue Extract—Rat tissue samples were homogenized with 5 volumes of extraction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor), and then the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the supernatant, and each sample was stored at –30 °C until used for the Western blot analysis. Expression of FLAG-tagged Numbl in COS-7 Cells—Transfection of pME-Numbl-FLAG into COS-7 cells was carried out using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) with 10 μg of the plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 40 h of incubation, the cells were extracted, and then the cell extract was subjected to the pull-down assay as described below. Pull-down Assay—Purified GST-14-3-3η (10 μg) was incubated with either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Numb/Numbl or with COS-7 cell extract containing overexpressed FLAG-tagged Numbl in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μm microcystin LR, and 0.5 μm okadaic acid (Buffer C) for 2 h at 4°C or room temperature (for recombinant Numb/Numbl), and then the samples were incubated with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (50% slurry) for 1 h. The glutathione-Sepharose resins were washed five times with buffer C, and then SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the resin, followed by either SDS-PAGE or Western blot analysis. Dephosphorylation of Numbl—GST-Numbl was phosphorylated by activated CaM-KI at 30 °C for 30 min as described above, followed by purification using glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography. Phosphorylated GST-Numbl (1 μg) was either left untreated or incubated with 0.025 units of protein phosphatase 2A (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 30 °C for the indicated period of time in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT in the presence of either GST (1.5 μg) or GST-14-3-3η (3.2 μg). The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were then subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using either anti-phospho-Numb/Numbl antibody or anti-Numbl antibody. Other Methods—Western blot analysis was performed with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-goat IgG antibody (Sigma) as a secondary antibody, and a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for detection.

https://openalex.org/W2070801999,"Exposure of Leishmania promastigotes to the temperature of their mammalian hosts induces a typical heat-shock response. In Leishmania infantum, HSP70 is encoded by two types of genes that differ in their 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs). Previously, we have shown that specific transcripts for each gene are present in promastigotes growing at normal temperature (26 °C), but only transcripts with 3′-UTR-type I (3′-UTRI) accumulate in a temperature-dependent manner. Here, we have investigated the translational efficiencies of both types of HSP70 transcripts at the different temperatures that the parasite encounters in the insect (26 °C, normal temperature) or in the mammalian host (heat-shock temperatures). Interestingly, 3′-UTRI-bearing transcripts (HSP70-I) were found associated with ribosomes in promastigotes at normal and heat-shock temperatures, whereas the HSP70-II transcripts appear to be preferentially translated at heat-shock temperatures but not at 26 °C. We have analyzed the function of these UTRs in the translational control by use of plasmid constructs in which the CAT reporter gene was flanked by UTRs of the HSP70 genes. Unexpectedly, it was found that CAT transcripts with 3′-UTRII bind to ribosomes at 26 °C, and, indeed, the CAT protein is synthesized. A valid conclusion of these experiments was that both types of 3′-UTRs are essential for translation of HSP70 mRNAs at heat shock temperatures, although the 3′-UTRII is more efficient during severe heat shock (39 °C). In addition, these results suggest that sequence region other than the 3′-UTR of HSP70-II gene is involved in the translational silent state of HSP70-II transcripts at 26 °C. Finally, a null mutant has been created by targeted disruption of both HSP70-II alleles. Remarkably, the ΔHSP70 mutant synthesizes HSP70 at a lower rate than the wild-type parasites. Overall, our data suggest that the biological function of the HSP70-II gene is to top up HSP70 levels under conditions of stress. Exposure of Leishmania promastigotes to the temperature of their mammalian hosts induces a typical heat-shock response. In Leishmania infantum, HSP70 is encoded by two types of genes that differ in their 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs). Previously, we have shown that specific transcripts for each gene are present in promastigotes growing at normal temperature (26 °C), but only transcripts with 3′-UTR-type I (3′-UTRI) accumulate in a temperature-dependent manner. Here, we have investigated the translational efficiencies of both types of HSP70 transcripts at the different temperatures that the parasite encounters in the insect (26 °C, normal temperature) or in the mammalian host (heat-shock temperatures). Interestingly, 3′-UTRI-bearing transcripts (HSP70-I) were found associated with ribosomes in promastigotes at normal and heat-shock temperatures, whereas the HSP70-II transcripts appear to be preferentially translated at heat-shock temperatures but not at 26 °C. We have analyzed the function of these UTRs in the translational control by use of plasmid constructs in which the CAT reporter gene was flanked by UTRs of the HSP70 genes. Unexpectedly, it was found that CAT transcripts with 3′-UTRII bind to ribosomes at 26 °C, and, indeed, the CAT protein is synthesized. A valid conclusion of these experiments was that both types of 3′-UTRs are essential for translation of HSP70 mRNAs at heat shock temperatures, although the 3′-UTRII is more efficient during severe heat shock (39 °C). In addition, these results suggest that sequence region other than the 3′-UTR of HSP70-II gene is involved in the translational silent state of HSP70-II transcripts at 26 °C. Finally, a null mutant has been created by targeted disruption of both HSP70-II alleles. Remarkably, the ΔHSP70 mutant synthesizes HSP70 at a lower rate than the wild-type parasites. Overall, our data suggest that the biological function of the HSP70-II gene is to top up HSP70 levels under conditions of stress. Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are causative agents of leishmaniasis, one of the major parasitic diseases in humans. Leishmaniasis affects ∼12 million people worldwide, and 1.5–2 million new cases occur every year (1Desjeux P. Comp. Immunol. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2004; 27: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Leishmania is a member of the family Trypanosomatidae and of the order Kinetoplastida. Kinetoplastid parasites are evolutionarily ancient organisms possessing very peculiar mechanisms to control gene expression (2Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of gene expression in Leishmania, and other kinetoplastid protozoa, occurs by mechanisms operating almost exclusively at post-transcriptional level (3Campbell D.A. Thomas S. Sturm N.R. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4Stiles J.K. Hicock P.I. Shah P.H. Meade J.C. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1999; 93: 781-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the mechanisms of gene expression are related to the unusual gene organization in these organisms. Sequencing of L. major chromosomes, recently completed (5Ivens A.C. Peacock C.S. Worthey E.A. Murphy L. Aggarwal G. Berriman M. Sisk E. Rajandream M.A. Adlem E. Aert R. Anupama A. Apostolou Z.

Science. 2005; 309: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), has revealed that most of the genes in Leishmania are organized into large clusters of genes located on the same DNA strand. Current data suggest that transcription by RNA polymerase II starts upstream of the most-5′ gene of each cluster, proceeding along the cluster and yielding polycistronic transcripts (6Martinez-Calvillo S. Yan S. Nguyen D. Fox M. Stuart K. Myler P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1291-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Martinez-Calvillo S. Nguyen D. Stuart K. Myler P.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In these organisms, the mature nuclear mRNAs are generated from polycistronic transcripts by trans-splicing and polyadenylation (8Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Given this constitutive production of transcripts, the regulation of gene expression must rely strongly on the stability of the mature transcript and on the efficiency with which is translated. However, how gene expression is regulated is one of the least understood aspects of these organisms. Leishmania parasites exhibit a two-phase life cycle, alternating between a bloodfeeding insect vector and a mammalian host. The parasites are exposed to growth conditions that differ significantly between vector and host in temperature, pH and nutrients. These environmental alterations act as differentiation signals, triggering changes in gene expression necessary to allow adaptation and differentiation. The temperature-induced gene expression, or heat shock response, is considered paramount to the differentiation process of Leishmania parasites (9Zilberstein D. Shapira M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 10Clos J. Krobitsch S. Am. Zool. 1999; 39: 848-856Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The heat shock or stress response has been conserved in evolution from bacteria to man, and the genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinUTRuntranslated regionUTRIUTR-type ICATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseORFopen reading frame. are among the most conserved evolutionarily (11Feder M.E. Hofmann G.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the heat shock response is an ideal model to study inducible genetic responses, offering an appropriate system to understand how the cell recognizes and responds to environmental cues (12Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the genes encoding HSPs in Leishmania are being extensively studied not only because of their importance for parasite differentiation but also as a prototypic gene model for deciphering the mechanisms of gene expression in this parasite. heat shock protein untranslated region UTR-type I chloramphenicol acetyltransferase open reading frame. Exposure of Leishmania promastigotes to temperatures typical of mammalian hosts leads to an accumulation of HSP70 and HSP83 transcripts. However, contrary to most eukaryotes, the transcription of HSP genes is not induced by heat shock in Leishmania (13Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, it was concluded that the temperature-induced accumulation of these HSP transcripts is promoted through post-transcriptional mechanisms. The gene organization and expression of HSP70 and HSP83 have been thoroughly studied in L. infantum and L. amazonensis. The L. amazonensis HSP83 gene cluster contains 18 gene copies, apparently identical, that are organized in a head-to-tail tandem (15Zilka A. Garlapati S. Dahan E. Yaolsky V. Shapira M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47922-47929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A similar organization is observed in L. infantum (16Angel S.O. Requena J.M. Soto M. Criado D. Alonso C. Acta Trop. 1996; 62: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By use of plasmid constructs, it was demonstrated that the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of HSP83 contains the regulatory cis-elements responsible for the temperature-dependent accumulation of the corresponding transcripts (15Zilka A. Garlapati S. Dahan E. Yaolsky V. Shapira M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47922-47929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Also, the increased translation of HSP83 transcripts, occurring upon temperature elevation, is controlled through an unknown mechanism recognizing sequence elements located in their 3′-UTRs (15Zilka A. Garlapati S. Dahan E. Yaolsky V. Shapira M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47922-47929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Larreta R. Soto M. Quijada L. Folgueira C. Abanades D.R. Alonso C. Requena J.M. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The organization and expression of HSP70 genes in L. infantum show peculiar features. There are six HSP70 genes arranged in a head-to-tail tandem and showing very limited sequence divergence (14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All the genes are conserved at their 5′-UTRs and coding regions; only the 3′-UTR of HSP70–6 gene is completely divergent relative to the 3′-UTR sequence shared by the other five genes. The most abundant HSP70 mRNAs correspond to HSP70–6 gene, but only mRNAs from genes 1 to 5 accumulate by heat shock (14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTRs together with downstream sequences of the HSP70 genes are necessary for a correct polyadenylation of both types of transcripts and are responsible for the differences in their steady-state levels (18Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Also, it was found that mRNAs derived from genes 1 to 5 contain a cis-acting sequence which functions as a positive element that is responsible for the temperature-dependent accumulation of HSP70–1-5 mRNAs. From now on, and for simplicity, we will refer to genes HSP70–1 to HSP70–5 as HSP70-I gene, and to gene HSP70–6 as HSP70-II. Here we have analyzed the translational profile of both types of HSP70 mRNAs at both normal and heat-shock temperatures. We find that the abundant HSP70-II transcripts are translationally silent at normal growth conditions, whereas the heat-inducible HSP70-I transcripts are translated at both normal and heat shock temperatures. The results suggest that the HSP70-II transcripts are stored in Leishmania parasites with the biological function of providing de novo synthesis of HSP70 when parasites encounter stress conditions. Parasites and Treatments—Promastigotes of Leishmania infantum (MCAN/ES/96/BCN150) were cultured in vitro at 26 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), adding penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Logarithmic phase cultures (5–9 × 106 promastigotes/ml) were used in all the experiments described. For heat shock experiments, aliquots of cultured L. infantum promastigotes were incubated at different temperatures (26 °C, 37 °C, 39 °C, and 41 °C) for different periods of time. Immediately after heat shock, parasites were spun down and harvested for the analysis of steady-state mRNA levels or de novo protein synthesis. Plasmid Constructs—The 5′-UTR, common to all L. infantum HSP70 genes, together with upstream sequences containing the appropriate signals for trans-splicing, were PCR-amplified using as template the pUCB2F clone. This clone is a pUC18 derivative that contains the 3.81-kb SalI DNA fragment from the genomic B2g6 clone (14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As primers, the following oligonucleotides were used: forward, 5′-TCTAGAAGATCTCGGAAGTGCTGCAGAGCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GATATCGATGGCGCCTTCGAATGTCAT-3′ (underlined are restriction sites included in the primers to facilitate cloning). After digesting the PCR product with XbaI plus EcoRV, the 1664-bp fragment was cloned into pBlCAT to generate CATC3′ clone. pBlCAT is a pBluescript derivative containing the coding region of CAT gene (17Larreta R. Soto M. Quijada L. Folgueira C. Abanades D.R. Alonso C. Requena J.M. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To clone the 3′-UTRI together with downstream sequences, the pUCB2F clone was also used as template for amplification with the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-AAGCTTATCGCCCGAGTGCGCCGGAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTCGAGATCTGATGGCGCCTTCGAATGTCAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with HindIII plus XhoI and cloned into CATC3′ to generate CATC3′C4 clone. Finally, CATC3′C4 was digested with BglII, and the chimeric CAT-HSP70-I gene was cloned into pX63NEO (19LeBowitz J.H. Cobura C.M. Beverley S.M. Gene. 1991; 103: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a vector for transfecting Leishmania, to generate pXcat70-I. To clone the 3′-UTR-II together with downstream sequences, PCR amplification with specific primers was performed using the pUCB2C clone as template. This clone is a pUC18-derivative containing the 5.72-kb SalI fragment from the genomic clone pB2g3 (14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The specific oligonucleotides were: forward, 5′-AAGCTTATCGCCCGAGTGCTGTGAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTCGACAGATCTTGACGGGTGAATGTGTTT-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with HindIII plus SalI, and the 1685-bp fragment was cloned into CATC3′ to obtain CATC3′C6. This plasmid was digested with BglII, and the chimeric CAT-HSP70-II gene was cloned into pX63NEO to generate pXcat70-II. The authenticity of each of the constructs and the fidelity of the PCR-amplified fragments were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The construction of plasmid pX5HisCAT3His, which contains the CAT gene flanked by UTRs derived from the L. infantum histone H2A gene, has been described elsewhere (17Larreta R. Soto M. Quijada L. Folgueira C. Abanades D.R. Alonso C. Requena J.M. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Generation of the Δhsp70-II Null Mutant—HSP70-II alleles were replaced sequentially with the ORF of the selectable marker gene comprising either the NEO gene or the HYG gene. Constructions were prepared in which the marker genes were flanked by specific regions located upstream and downstream of the ORF for HSP70-II gene. For this purpose, we chose the CATC3′C6 clone, which contains the CAT flanked by upstream plus 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR plus downstream sequences of the HSP70-II gene (see above). The CAT gene in CATC3′C6 was removed by BstBI plus HindIII double digestion and replaced by the appropriate cassettes containing either NEO or HYG genes. For the amplification of the NEO cassette, the pcDNA3.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen) was used as template and the following primers: forward, 5′-GGTTCGAAATTGAACAAGATGGATTGCA-3′ (underlined is the BstBI restriction site); reverse, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAG-3′ (underlined is the HindIII restriction site). For the amplification of the HYG cassette, the pIRES1hyg cloning vector (Clontech) was used as template and the following primers: forward, 5′-GGTTCGAAGATAGATCCGGAAAGCCTGA-3′ (underlined is the BstBI restriction site); reverse, 5′-CCAAGCTTCTATTCCTTTGCCCTCGGACG-3′ (underlined is the HindIII restriction site). The resulting constructs were named Neo70-II and Hyg70-II, respectively. 2 μg of these constructs was cut with BglII, and the linearized DNAs were individually used for transfection to disrupt HSP70-II gene in L. infantum. After transfection and selection (see below), the resulting HSP70-II null mutant was designated as Δhsp70-II::NEO/Δhsp70-II::HYG, following the genetic nomenclature for Trypanosoma and Leishmania outlined by Clayton et al. (20Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R. Baltz T. Barrett M. Bastien P. Belli S. Beverley S. Biteau N. Blackwell J. Blaineau C. Boshart M. Bringaud F. Cross G. Cruz A. Degrave W. Donelson J. El-Sayed N.

Transfections of Leishmania Promastigotes—DNA for transfections was prepared using the Qiagen plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Late logarithmic phase L. infantum promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation and suspended at 2 × 108 parasites/ml in Cytomix buffer (21van den Hoff M.J.B. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), using 108 parasites per transfection. Electroporation was performed in a Bio-Rad GenePulser using the conditions recently described by Robinson and Beverley (22Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For clonal selection, the transfected parasites were plated on blood-agar plates (23Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) supplemented with either 20 μg/ml G418 (Roche Applied Science) or 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). Polysome Fractionation by Sucrose Gradients, RNA Purification, and Northern Blotting—The analysis of polysomal distribution of HSP70 mRNAs by sucrose gradients was performed basically as described elsewhere (24Soto M. Iborra S. Quijada L. Folgueira C. Alonso C. Requena J.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 617-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications intending to minimize RNA degradation. Briefly, L. infantum parasites (2.5 × 108 promastigotes) were harvested, washed twice with pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mg/ml heparin, and 0.5% Nonidet P40), supplemented with 240 units of SUPERase-In (Ambion, Austin, TX). Lysis was favored by pipetting up and down ten times. After lysis, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was supplemented with 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove mitochondria and cellular debris. The supernatant was layered on 11 ml of sucrose gradient and centrifuged in an SW-41T rotor at 170,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, the gradients were harvested from the top using a fraction collector. The A254 nm was recorded throughout the harvest. Fifteen fractions of 800 μl were collected. SDS (1% final concentration), EDTA (pH 8.0; final concentration, 10 mm), and proteinase K (final concentration, 200 mg/ml) were added to each fraction and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After extraction with a mixture of phenol/chloroform/isoamylic alcohol (25/24/1), the RNA from the fractions was precipitated with ethanol at –20 °C. RNA samples purified from each fraction were separated on denaturing 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred onto nylon membranes. Aliquots of the RNA samples were also analyzed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA from L. infantum promastigotes was isolated using the Total Quick RNA Cells and Tissues kit (Talent, Trieste, Italy). Total RNA (4 μg/lane) was size-separated on 1% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gels and electrophoresed onto nylon membranes using the Transfer Power Lid System (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA). DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed as reported early (14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For reuse, blots were treated with 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 95 °C to remove previously hybridized probes. The 3′-UTRI probe was obtained by BamHI digestion of clone pB3′-UTRIc, a pBluescript derivative that contains the complete 3′-UTR-I from L. infantum HSP70 gene 1 (18Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR-II probe was obtained by HindIII plus SacI double digestion of clone pTC6, which is a pBluescript derivative, including the PCR amplification product of the 3′-UTR-II and down-stream sequences (this product was used to generate the construct pXcat70-II (see above)). The α-tubulin probe was obtained from clone pTcα3 (26Soares C.M.A. de Carvalho E.F. Urmenyi T.P. Carvalho J.F.O. de Castro F.T. Rondinelli E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli CAT probe was obtained from clone pBlCAT (17Larreta R. Soto M. Quijada L. Folgueira C. Abanades D.R. Alonso C. Requena J.M. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation—After appropriate treatment, 6 × 107 parasites were collected and resuspended in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine (Met-, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Proteins were labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine protein labeling mix (Redivue Pro-mix [l-35S], >1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). After labeling, cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) in a Mini-protein system (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analysis, the electrophoresed proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% Tween 20. The filters were probed with anti-HSP70 serum obtained from a rabbit immunized with the recombinant L. infantum HSP70 (27Rico A.I. Angel S.O. Alonso C. Requena J.M. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or with rabbit anti-CAT serum (Sigma). An anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase immunoconjugate (Nordic Immunologic, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was used as secondary antibody, and the specific binding was revealed with the ECL® Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of the de novo HSP70 and CAT synthesis was performed on 35S-labeled promastigotes by immunoprecipitation. After labeling (see above), cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in prechilled phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 30 min with gentle shaking, in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were sonicated for 10 min for clearance of the nucleic acids and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The soluble extract was mixed with 20 μl of rabbit antiserum against L. infantum HSP70, or 5 μl of rabbit anti-CAT serum, and incubated on an orbital rotator for 15 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads (15 μl), conjugated with Protein A (Sigma), were equilibrated in 50 μl of lysis buffer and added to the L. infantum extract-HSP70/CAT antiserum mixture. The mixture was incubated on a rotator for 2 h at 4°C, the beds were collected by centrifugation, and washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100), twice in 0.5 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and once in 0.5 ml of buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Triton X-100). Finally, the beads were resuspended in 60 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and, after drying of the gel, analyzed by exposure to x-ray films. Total amount of immunoprecipitated HSP70 and CAT proteins was analyzed by Western blotting using either the anti-HSP70 or anti-CAT sera (see above). Quantitative Analysis—Coomassie Blue-stained gels and autoradiographs were scanned with the GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Quantity One version 3.0, Bio-Rad). Measurements were performed under conditions in which a linear correlation existed between the amount of proteins or RNA and the intensities of the bands. Expression of the L. infantum HSP70 Genes—The L. infantum HSP70 locus contains six tandemly arranged genes (14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that are highly similar in sequence, and the main difference among them is found at the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs). As depicted in Fig. 1A, the sixth gene of the cluster has a divergent 3′-UTR (named 3′-UTRII) relative to the 3′-UTR (named 3′-UTRI) that is common to the other five genes. We will refer to genes HSP70–1 to -5 as HSP70-type I (or HSP70-I) and to gene 6 as HSP70-type II (or HSP70-II). A BLAST search in the genome data base of Leishmania major strain Friedlin (www.geneDB.org) identified on chromosome 28 a similar genomic organization for the two types of HSP70 genes in this L. major strain, although the number of HSP70-type I genes is lower in L. major than in L. infantum. Northern blots of L. infantum RNA samples, probed with the different 3′-UTRs, revealed that the abundance of HSP70 transcripts with 3′-UTRI increases in promastigotes incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the levels of HSP70 mRNAs with 3′-UTRII remained approximately constant at the different temperatures. These results agree with our previously reported data, which demonstrated that only HSP70–3′-UTRI transcripts accumulate in a temperature-dependent manner (14Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M.

To determine the effect of temperature on the synthesis of HSP70 protein, L. infantum promastigotes were labeled by metabolic incorporation of [35S]methionine/cysteine at different temperatures, and HSP70 was immunoprecipitated with a specific serum. Fig. 1C shows an autoradiograph of the total promastigote proteins labeled at 26 °C, 37 °C, 39 °C, and 41 °C. Total protein synthesis was only slightly affected by incubation at 37 °C, indicating that 37 °C is not a severe heat-shock temperature for Leishmania.

The LTR enhancer contains 14 tandemly repeated subunits with recurrent CCAAT, GTGGGGA, and GATA motifs. Here we showed that in erythroid K562 cells these DNA motifs bound the following three transcription factors: ubiquitous NF-Y and hematopoietic MZF1 and GATA-2. These factors and their target DNA motifs exhibited a hierarchy of DNA/protein and protein/protein binding affinities: NF-Y/CCAAT > NF-Y/GATA-2 > NF-Y/MZF1 > MZF1/GTGGGGA; GATA-2/GATA. Through protein/protein interactions, NF-Y bound at the CCAAT motif recruited MZF1 and GATA-2, but not Sp1 and GATA-1, and stabilized their binding to the neighboring GTGGGGA and GATA sites to assemble a novel LTR enhancer complex, NF-Y/MZF1/GATA-2. In the LTR-HS5-ϵp-GFP plasmid integrated into K562 cells, mutation of the CCAAT motif in the LTR enhancer to abolish NF-Y binding inactivated the enhancer, closed down the chromatin structure of the ϵ-globin promoter, and silenced transcription of the green fluorescent protein gene. The results indicated that NF-Y bound at the CCAAT motifs assembled a robust LTR enhancer complex, which could act over the intervening DNA to remodel the chromatin structure and to stimulate the transcription of the downstream gene locus.

Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y. NF-Y is a trimeric complex composed of NF-YA, -YB, and -YC, in which the YB and YC subunits bind to DNA through their histone fold domains, and the YA subunit, recruited by this dimeric complex, binds through its specific DNA binding domain to the CCAAT motif (21Bi W.

The human β-globin gene locus spans the embryonic ϵ-, the fetal Gγ- and Aγ-, and the adult δ- and β-globin genes arranged in the transcriptional order of 5′ ϵ-Gγ-Aγ-δ-β 3′ in the chromosome. The β-globin locus control region (β-LCR), located 10–60 kb upstream of the globin genes and defined by DNase I-hypersensitive sites HS1–5, plays a pivotal role in regulating transcriptional activation of the far downstream β-like globin genes (31Tuan D.

In an effort to define the 5′ border of the β-LCR, we previously cloned and sequenced the DNA further upstream of the HS5 site, and we discovered a solitary ERV-9 LTR located 1.5 kb upstream of the HS5 site in the 5′ boundary area of the human β-LCR (15Long Q. Bengra C. Li C. Kutlar F. Tuan D. Genomics. 1998; 54: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that this 5′ HS5 ERV-9 LTR possesses prominent enhancer activity in embryonic and erythroid cell lines (16Ling J. Pi W. Bollag R. Zeng S. Keskintepe M. Saliman H. Krantz S. Whitney B. Tuan D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in oocytes and progenitor cells, including the erythroid progenitor cells, but not in differentiated somatic tissues in transgenic Zebrafish and humans (34Pi W. Yang Z. Wang J. Ruan L. Yu X. Ling J. Krantz S. Isales C. Conway S.J. Lin S. Tuan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unlike the HS2 and HS3 enhancers of the β-LCR, whose enhancer activities are blocked by the HS5 site with reported insulator properties when HS5 is interposed between the enhancer and the cis-linked promoter (35Chung J. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1983; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 36Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 1995; 84: 1399-1401Crossref Google Scholar), the ERV-9 LTR enhancer is not blocked by the interposed HS5 site (37Ling J. Pi W. Yu X. Bengra C. Long Q. Jin H. Seyfang A. Tuan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4582-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To characterize further the 5′ HS5 ERV-9 LTR to gain insight into its functional significance, we here identified the transcription factors that bound to and activated the LTR enhancer. Wild type and mutant LTR-GFP plasmids were transfected into leukemic K562 cells that exhibit properties of erythroid progenitor cells and express the embryonic globin gene program (38Horton M. Cedar H. Maryanka D. Mills F. Turberville C. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A. Globin Gene Expression and Hematopoietic Differentiation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1983: 305-322Google Scholar) and the embryonic teratocarcinoma PA-1 cells derived from primordial oocytes (39Zeuthen J. Norgaard J. Avner P. Fellous M. Wartiovaara J. Vaheri A. Rosen A. Giovanella B. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The results showed that base substitutions in the CCAAT, GTGGGGA, and GATA motifs reduced LTR enhancer activity, with the CCAAT mutation generating the largest reduction of up to 98%. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that these core motifs flanked by the respective consensus bases bound three transcription factors, ubiquitous NF-Y and hematopoietic MZF1 and GATA-2. Furthermore, competitive EMSAs and Western blots of proteins that bound to and were eluted from magnetic beads conjugated to the wild type or mutant LTR enhancer probes showed that through protein/protein interactions NF-Y bound at the CCAAT motif recruited MZF1 and GATA-2, but not Sp1 and GATA-1, and stabilized their binding to the neighboring GTGGGGA and GATA sites to assemble a novel LTR enhancer complex, the NF-Y/MZF1/GATA-2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed that these transcription factors and the ERV-9 LTR were associated with one another in vivo. In the LTR-HS5-ϵp-GFP plasmid integrated into the genome of K562 cells, abolishing NF-Y binding to the LTR enhancer by mutating the CCAAT motif in the LTR enhancer closed down the chromatin structure of the ϵ-globin promoter and silenced the transcription of the GFP gene. The results indicate that the robust LTR enhancer complex assembled by NF-Y could act over the intervening DNA to remodel the chromatin structure and stimulate the transcription of a cis-linked gene locus in embryonic and erythroid progenitor cells. Constructs—The wild type (wt) and mutant (4-1)-P-GFP constructs (Fig. 1) were made from pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) as follows. The cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter 5′ of the GFP gene was deleted by AseI and NheI digestions. The LTR promoter, U3P, generated by PCR with a 5′ cloning site of AseI-BglII and a 3′ cloning site of NheI was inserted into this cleaved vector to make the U3P-GFP plasmid. To make the (4-1)-P-GFP and the mutant MI-IV-P-GFP plasmids, synthetic oligonucleotides spanning the wt or mutant (4-1) LTR enhancer with the 5′ AseI site and the 3′ XbaI-BglII site were inserted into AseI- and BglII-cleaved U3P-GFP. The (4-1) LTR enhancer spanned DNA bases 1116–1193, and the LTR promoter P spanned bases 1194–1342 in the ERV-9 LTR (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 15Long Q. Bengra C. Li C. Kutlar F. Tuan D. Genomics. 1998; 54: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mutant enhancer MI–MIV contained base substitutions in the CCAAT motif of E1 and GATA and GGTGGGGA motif of E4, respectively (see Fig. 1B). To ensure that the GFP gene was enhanced by only the ERV-9 LTR enhancer in these plasmids, the SV40 enhancer/promoter driving the neomycin resistance gene located 3′ of the GFP gene in pEGFP was deleted by SspI and StuI digestions. To ensure proper processing of GFP mRNA, the SV40 intron (Promega bulletin 80) was added between EcoRI and SalI sites in the polycloning site region 3′ of the GFP gene. Construction of the E-P-GFP plasmid (Fig. 1B) was described previously (16Ling J. Pi W. Bollag R. Zeng S. Keskintepe M. Saliman H. Krantz S. Whitney B. Tuan D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The (4-1)-HS5-ϵp-GFP and MI-HS5-ϵp-GFP plasmids (Fig. 7) were constructed from the respective (4-1)- and MI-P-GFP plasmids. In these plasmids, the LTR promoter was deleted with XbaI and AgeI digestions. Into the cleaved vector, DNA fragments spanning HS5 (base positions 6050–6550, GenBank™ accession number AF064190) and ϵp amplified by PCR from the LTR-HS5-ϵp-GFP plasmid (37Ling J. Pi W. Yu X. Bengra C. Long Q. Jin H. Seyfang A. Tuan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4582-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) by primers tagged with XbaI and AgeI sites were inserted. For transfection, all constructs were linearized at an ApaLI site in the vector 300 bases 5′ of the inserts (37Ling J. Pi W. Yu X. Bengra C. Long Q. Jin H. Seyfang A. Tuan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4582-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—K562 cells and ovarian teratocarcinoma PA-1 cells (from ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfection, 4 × 106 cells were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of the linearized plasmid and 3 μg of CMV-β-gal plasmid (Clontech). GFP expression levels of the transfected plasmids were normalized with respect to the level of the β-galactosidase to correct for possible differences in transfection efficiencies as described (16Ling J. Pi W. Bollag R. Zeng S. Keskintepe M. Saliman H. Krantz S. Whitney B. Tuan D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To obtain K562 cells with integrated plasmids, the linearized plasmids were co-transfected with a pCDNeo plasmid by electroporation (37Ling J. Pi W. Yu X. Bengra C. Long Q. Jin H. Seyfang A. Tuan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4582-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The electroporated cells were immediately divided into 3 equal aliquots and cultured separately in medium containing G418 at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml. One month later, the cells were sorted by FACS. The GFP-positive cells were propagated in the same medium, and 108 cells were harvested for FACS analysis and DNase I hypersensitivity mapping. Nuclear Extracts and EMSA—Nuclear extracts from 5 × 107 K562 or PA-1 cells were prepared, and EMSA was carried out as described (40Ramchandran R. Bengra C. Whitney B. Lanclos K. Tuan D. Am. J. Hematol. 2000; 65: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The EMSA reaction (10 μl) contained 2–4 μg of nuclear extract and 40–50 fmol of labeled probe. In competition assays, the unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were incubated with the nuclear extract for 10 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of the labeled probe. For antibody supershift assays, 2 μl of antibody to NF-YA (Rockland, 200-401-100), GATA-1, and GATA-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-13053x and SC-1235x) or Sp1 (Upstate Technology, 07-124) was added prior to the addition of the probe. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to MZF1 was made by BioSynthesis with a synthetic polypeptide that corresponded to amino acids 444–463 located between the 12th and the 13th zinc fingers in the C terminus of MZF1 (27Hromas R.

The antigenic serum was further purified through protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). The EMSA reactions were resolved in 5% nondenaturing PAGE and analyzed in a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences) as described (40Ramchandran R. Bengra C. Whitney B. Lanclos K. Tuan D. Am. J. Hematol. 2000; 65: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Isolation of Proteins Bound to the LTR Enhancer and Western Blots—The biotinylated wild type E2 or mutant E2(CCAAT)m (300 pmol, synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies) was conjugated with 25 mg of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal Biotech) according to vendor protocol. The K562 nuclear extract (12 mg of total protein) was precleared by incubation with poly(dI-dC) as in EMSA for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then incubated with the probe-conjugated magnetic beads (25 mg) on a rotation platform at 4 °C overnight. The protein-bound beads were collected and washed exhaustively with 10 ml each of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) for 7–8 times, followed by the binding buffer containing 0.1 and 0.2 m NaCl 2 times for each buffer. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads with the binding buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The eluted proteins were detected by Western blots with antibodies of interest using ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). ChIP and Re-ChIP—ChIP was performed as described by Johnson and Bresnick (41Johnson K. Bresnick E. Methods. 2002; 26: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The K562 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde; nuclei were isolated, sonicated, and pre-cleared with rabbit preimmune serum. Aliquots of the pre-cleared chromatin solution from 5 × 106 cells were either set aside as input or incubated with 5 μg of specific rabbit antibodies to NF-YA, GATA-2, GATA-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-10779x, SC9008x, and SC13053x), MZF1 (BioSynthesis), or preimmune rabbit IgG on a rotation platform at 4 °C for 3–5 h. After reversal of the cross-links, the DNA was purified from the immune complexes and analyzed by isotopic PCR for 29 cycles. The PCR primer pair used to amplify the ERV9-LTR enhancer in quantitative, radioisotopic PCR was forward primer 5′-CTGAGTTTGCTGGGGATGCGAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATACAGACTGCCGATTGGTGTATT-3′. The input DNA template used was 0.025% that of the DNA templates in the immunocomplexes. The PCR conditions were 2 pmol of each primer, 0.15 mm dNTPs with 0.2 μCi of [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 28 cycles. The PCR products were resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide gel and quantified in a PhosphorImager. In re-ChIP assays, the immunocomplexes with the first antibody were eluted by incubation with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. The eluates were diluted 50 times with IP dilution buffer and re-immunoprecipitated with a desired second antibody. The DNA was isolated and analyzed as described for ChIP. DNase I Hypersensitivity Mapping—Nuclei were isolated from 1 × 108 K562 cells as described (31Tuan D. Solomon W. Li Q. London I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Aliquots (200 μl) of the nuclei were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and digested with 0, 2, 4, and 8 units of DNase I (Roche Applied Science). The DNAs purified from the digested nuclei were cleaved with appropriate restriction enzymes, resolved in 1.2% agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized simultaneously with the GFP and HS4 probes as described (31Tuan D. Solomon W. Li Q. London I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Mutations in the CCAAT, GATA, and GTGGGGA Motifs Reduced LTR Enhancer Activity—To examine the contribution of the CCAAT, GATA, and GTGGGGA core motifs to LTR enhancer function, we created wt and mutant (4-1)-P-GFP plasmids that contained base mutations in the respective motifs in the (4-1) enhancer. In these recombinant constructs, the (4-1) subunits were used to represent the LTR enhancer, because they span all three motifs to be mutated and are located at the very 3′ end of the LTR enhancer repeats (1–2-3–4)3-(4-1), contiguous with the LTR promoter (Fig. 1A). The wt (4-1) and six mutant enhancers, MI, MII, MIIa, MIIb, MIII, and MIV, were linked to the LTR promoter to create the respective (4-1)-P-GFP and MI-IV-P-GFP plasmids (Fig. 1B). In MI, the CCAAT motif in E1 was mutated to AACCG (Fig. 1B). In MII, both the GATA (TATC) and the contiguous TAGCTA motifs in E4 were mutated to TATGTACCAT (Fig. 1B). To determine the relative contribution to LTR enhancer activity of these two sub-motifs, MIIa- and MIIb-P-GFP plasmids were created; MIIa contained a base substitution only in the GATA moiety, whereas MIIb contained base substitutions only in the TAGCTA moiety (Fig. 1B). In MIII and MIV, the respective 5′-GTGGGGA and 3′-GTGGAGA motifs in E4, GTGGGGACGTGGAGA (Fig. 1A), were mutated to GAGGAGA (Fig. 1B) to determine their respective contribution to LTR enhancer activity. The wt (4-1)-P-GFP plasmid and the mutant plasmids together with the E-P-GFP plasmid containing the full-length LTR enhancer spanning the 14 tandem repeats were transiently transfected into erythroid K562 and embryonic teratocarcinoma PA-1 cells. FACS analyses of the GFP fluorescence levels of the transfected cells (Fig. 1C) showed that MI-P-GFP containing the CCAAT mutation exhibited the largest range of reduction in enhancer activity of 50% in K562 and 90% in PA-1 cells. MIII-P-GFP containing base substitutions in the 5′-GTGGGGA motif exhibited a slightly smaller range of reduction of 50% in K562 cells and 70% in PA-1 cells. In contrast, MIV-P-GFP containing base substitutions in the 3′-GTGGAGA motif exhibited a much milder reduction of 10–20%, indicating that the 3′-GTGGAGA motif contributed marginally to LTR enhancer activity. In K562 cells, MII-P-GFP containing mutations in both the TATC (GATA) and the TAGCT motifs exhibited a reduction in enhancer activity of ∼40% in both K562 and PA-1 cells. In K562 cells, the MIIa- and MIIb-P-GFP plasmids did not exhibit a significant reduction in activity given the size of the error bars, suggesting that MIIa and MIIb enhancers with mutation in either the GATA core or the flanking bases bound the supposed GATA factor almost as well as the wt (4-1) enhancer. However, in PA-1 cells, MIIa, MIIb, and MII exhibited similar reductions in enhancer activity of 40–50%, suggesting that neither MIIa and MIIb containing single mutations nor MII containing double mutations bound the supposed GATA factor as well as the wt (4-1) enhancer. Although the wt (4-1) enhancer showed comparable activity in PA-1 as in K562 cells (Fig. 1C, legend), the full-length LTR enhancer was four times more active in PA-1 cells (Fig. 1C, lane E), apparently because the 14 tandem subunits acted more cooperatively in PA-1 than in K562 cells. CCAAT, GTGGGGA, and GATA Motifs in the LTR Enhancer Bind Transcription Factors NF-Y, MZF1 and GATA-2, but Not Sp1, and GATA-1—To identify the transcription factors that bind to and activate the wt and the mutant plasmids in K562 and PA-1 cells, we synthesized E1 and E4 probes spanning enhancer subunits 1 and 4, respectively (Fig. 2A), and we used them with K562 and PA-1 nuclear extracts in EMSAs, in competition assays with various competitors, and in antibody supershift assays. Note that in order not to miss potential protein-binding sites in the 3′ junction region, E1 probe extended into the 5′ end of E2 containing the GATA site (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A). The E1 probe generated two prominent EMSA bands with the K562 nuclear extract (Fig. 2B, lane 1). The faster migrating band was generated by the GATA (TATC) motif binding to the GATA factor(s), because the (GATA)7 competitor of the HS5 region (Fig. 2A), previously shown to bind to GATA-1 and weakly to GATA-2 (40Ramchandran R. Bengra C. Whitney B. Lanclos K. Tuan D. Am. J. Hematol. 2000; 65: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), completely obliterated this band (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Furthermore, the antibody to GATA-2 also completely obliterated this band, whereas the antibody to GATA-1 partially obliterated this band (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 10). Note that the GATA-2 and GATA-1 antibodies did not supershift but caused the disappearance of the cognate EMSA bands, as observed"

A number of soluble proteins have been identified that facilitate the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, but few proteins have been defined that selectively opsonize necrotic cells. Previous studies have shown that histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), an abundant (∼100 μg/ml) 75-kDa plasma glycoprotein, binds to cell surface heparan sulfate on viable cells and cross-links other ligands, such as plasminogen, to the cell surface. In this study we have demonstrated that HRG also binds very strongly, in a heparan sulfate-independent manner, to cytoplasmic ligand(s) exposed in necrotic cells. This interaction is mediated by the amino-terminal domain of HRG and results in enhanced phagocytosis of the necrotic cells by a monocytic cell line. In contrast, it was found that HRG binds poorly to and does not opsonize early stage apoptotic cells. Thus, HRG has the unique property of selectively recognizing necrotic cells and may play an important physiological role in vivo by facilitating the uptake and clearance of necrotic, but not apoptotic, cells by phagocytes.

Cell death is vital for the morphological shaping of tissues during development and for the sculpting of functionally appropriate cellular repertoires as well as for protecting an individual from viral infections and pathogenic microorganisms (1Surh C.D. Sprent J. Nature. 1994; 372: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 2Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Selective cell death continues to play a role in the homeostasis of mature tissues, such as the deletion of immune cells in the attenuation of an immune response (3Webb S. Morris C. Sprent J. Cell. 1990; 63: 1249-1256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) and the elimination of cells that have become functionally inappropriate, including virally infected and transformed cells (4Kagi D. Seiler P. Pavlovic J. Ledermann B. Burki K. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Apoptosis and necrosis represent two different forms of cell death and are characterized by distinct morphologies. Rapid and efficient phagocytic removal of dying cells is a key feature of apoptosis, whereas the role and extent of phagocytosis in the clearance of necrotic cells is not well documented. It is thought, however, that by engulfing necrotic and apoptotic cells phagocytes of the innate immune system not only provide a first line of defense against microbial pathogens but also dispose of self-antigens that are released from dying cells (5Franc N.C. White K. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by an orderly sequence of internal events, including chromatin condensation that precedes the loss of cellular integrity (6Harvey K.J. Lukovic D. Ucker D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells also display phosphatidylserine and altered membrane carbohydrates on their surface. Multiple ligands and receptors have been implicated in the recognition and uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes prior to membrane lysis, thus preventing release of potentially toxic and immunogenic intracellular substances into tissues. In addition, the binding and/or uptake of apoptotic cells inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production (7Huynh M.L. Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). When there are disturbances in either apoptosis or the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, antibodies against subsequently exposed nucleosomes may be formed, leading to the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast to apoptosis, necrotic cell death has usually been defined as a disordered mode of cell death, occurring either in cases of severe and acute injuries such as sudden shortage of nutrients and abrupt anoxia or in extreme injuries such as exposure to heat, detergents, strong bases, and irradiation (8Fishelson Z. Attali G. Mevorach D. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Proskuryakov S.Y. Konoplyannikov A.G. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). More recently, the existence of a necrotic-like cell death pathway regulated by an intrinsic death program distinct from that of apoptosis has also become apparent (9Proskuryakov S.Y. Konoplyannikov A.G. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 10Kitanaka C. Kuchino Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Necrotic cell death is characterized by the rapid and disorganized swelling and rupture of a cell (11Shacter E. Williams J.A. Hinson R.M. Senturker S. Lee Y.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with apoptotic cells, necrotic cells are usually rapidly cleared from the circulation by phagocytic cells. A large number of soluble extracellular proteins have been described (12Savill J. Dransfield I. Gregory C. Haslett C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar) that bind to apoptotic cells and facilitate their uptake by macrophages. In contrast, few proteins have been identified that can specifically opsonize necrotic cells.

HRG is a multidomain molecule consisting of an amino-terminal domain composed of two cystatin-like modules (N1N2), a central histidine-rich region, and a carboxyl-terminal domain (30Koide T.

Such a molecular structure allows the molecule to act as an adaptor protein that cross-links different ligands in solution or on cell surfaces (13Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the histidine-rich region of HRG has recently been shown to mediate anti-angiogenic effects (32Juarez J.C.

While investigating the interaction of HRG with different cell populations, it became apparent that the molecule bound strongly to dead cells; thus we undertook a detailed study of the interaction of HRG with necrotic, apoptotic, and viable cells. It was found that HRG binds avidly to necrotic cells, but not to early stage apoptotic cells, and aids the uptake of necrotic cells by a phagocytic cell line. Although HRG interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate on viable cells, additional experiments revealed that HRG binds via its N1N2 domain to a cytoplasmic ligand within necrotic cells that is not heparan sulfate. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that HRG represents a novel plasma protein that specifically facilitates the ingestion of necrotic cells by phagocytes and thus may play a key role in maintaining the efficient clearance of necrotic cells and necrotic cell debris from the circulation. Cell Lines—THP-1 and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). pgsA-745 cells are a mutant form of the CHO-KI parent cell line and are unable to express any cell surface heparan sulfate due to a deficiency in xylosyltransferase. Both CHO-KI (GAG+ve) and pgsA-745 (GAG-ve) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 21 μg/ml l-proline and 10% FCS. Mammalian cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The Spodoptera frugiperda-derived insect cell line (Sf-9) was cultured in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Purification of HRG—HRG was purified from human plasma based on a previously described method (16Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30114-30122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Rylatt D.B. Sia D.Y. Mundy J.P. Parish C.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, human plasma was passed through a phosphocellulose column equilibrated with 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8. Bound HRG was eluted with 2.0 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8. Recombinant full-length HRG (507 amino acids) (30Koide T. Foster D. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the N1N2 amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1-112) consisting of two cystatin-like modules, were produced in insect Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system as previously described (16Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30114-30122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Flow Cytometry—Cell lines were analyzed for HRG binding by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Typically, plasma-purified or recombinant HRG and recombinant N1N2 domain (100 μg/ml) were added to 5 × 105 cells in PBS/0.1% BSA ± 20 μm Zn2+ for 60 min at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS/0.1% BSA. Cell-bound HRG or N1N2 domain was detected using the HRG-specific mAb HRG-4 (AGEN, Brisbane, Australia). Cell surface heparan sulfate expression was detected by the heparan sulfate-specific mAb F58-10E4 (Seikagku Corp., Tokyo, Japan), followed by secondary detection with sheep anti-mouse Ig fluorescein isothiocyanate (Amrad Biotech, Melbourne, Australia). Cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using an LSR Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Each treatment condition was typically repeated in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated two to three times. In some experiments human HRG (100 μg/ml) was co-incubated with 100 μg/ml of 12.5-kDa bovine lung heparin (Sigma). Induction and Detection of Necrotic Cells—Jurkat T-cells were induced into necrosis by exposure to hyperthermic conditions. Cells were resuspended to a cell concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640/10% FCS and placed into a 56 °C water bath for 45 min. Necrotic cells were detected by incubating cells with the DNA intercalating dye 7-AAD (0.3 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) in PBS/0.1% BSA (pH 7.2) for 15 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry as described. Necrotic cells were detected by gating on 7-AAD-positive cells. Induction and Detection of Apoptotic Cells—Jurkat T-cells were resuspended to 5 × 105 cell/ml and incubated with 1 μm camptothecin (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 6 h. Detection of apoptotic cells was achieved by Annexin-V-PE cell surface staining (BD Biosciences) and 7-AAD nuclear uptake (0.3 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes) using flow cytometry as described. Early stage apoptotic cells were defined as Annexin-V-positive, 7-AAD-negative cells. Dye Labeling—THP-1 cells were labeled with carboxy-seminaphthorhodafluor (SNARF-1) (Molecular Probes) or PKH26 (Sigma), and Jurkat cells were labeled with carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes). For SNARF-1 labeling, THP-1 cells (5 × 107 cell/ml) diluted in RPMI 1640 were incubated with SNARF-1 (25 μm) for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath. Cells were then washed four times in RPMI 1640/10% FCS to remove unbound SNARF-1. For PKH26 labeling, THP-1 cells (≤5 × 107 cell) were washed in PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 250 μl of PBS. PKH26 was pre-diluted in 19.5 μl of diluent C (Sigma) and immediately added to cells at a final concentration of 20 nm for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 275 μl of FCS for 1 min. Cells were washed four times in RPMI 1640/10% FCS to remove unbound PKH26. For CFSE labeling, Jurkat T-cells (5 × 107 cell/ml) diluted in RPMI 1640 were incubated with CFSE (2 μm) for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath. Cells were washed four times in RPMI 1640/10% FCS to remove unbound CFSE. Some of the Jurkat T-cells were then induced into necrosis or apoptosis as described. Confocal Microscopy—Viable and necrotic CHO-KI and pgsA-745 cells were incubated with HRG as described above for immunofluorescence flow cytometry and examined by confocal microscopy for HRG localization. In the case of the phagocytosis assay, PKH26-labeled THP-1 cells were incubated with CFSE-labeled necrotic Jurkat cells for 80 min at 37 °C. Cell suspensions were mounted onto glass slides, and confocal images were visualized on a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 confocal microscope with a Nikon super high pressure mercury lamp power supply (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and a Radiance 2000 laser scanning system (Bio-Rad). Phagocytosis Assay—Equal volumes of SNARF-1-labeled THP-1 cells (1 × 106 cell/ml) and CFSE-labeled Jurkat cells (1 × 107 cell/ml) in RPMI 1640/10% FCS were mixed and incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2, 0-80 min) with either ovalbumin (OVA) (100 μg/ml; Sigma) or different concentrations of HRG in the presence or absence of 12.5-kDa bovine lung heparin (100 μg/ml), porcine muscle tropomyosin (200 μg/ml; Sigma), a CD32 (FcγRII) mAb (clone 8.26) (37Ierino F.L.

Cells were then immediately placed on ice and analyzed by flow cytometry. Rate of phagocytosis was calculated as the percentage of SNARF+ THP-1 that were CFSE+. Proper inter- and intralaser compensations were determined using single color controls before each experimental run. Binding of HRG and OVA to Intracellular Ligands—Recombinant full-length HRG or the N1N2 domain of HRG (20 μl, 100 μg/ml) or OVA (20 μl, 100 μg/ml) diluted in PBS was incubated with fixed monolayers of HEp-2 human epithelial cells (HEp-2 slides; INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) for 30 min. The slides were extensively washed with PBS before detection of bound HRG using a HRG-specific mAb, HRG-4 (AGEN), or OVA using an OVA-specific mAb (Sigma) followed by secondary detection with sheep anti-mouse Ig fluorescein isothiocyanate (Amrad Biotech). Slides were mounted with coverslips and fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) before viewing immediately using an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). In some experiments HRG (100 μg/ml) was co-incubated with 12.5-kDa bovine lung heparin (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) or porcine muscle tropomyosin (200 μg/ml) (Sigma). In other experiments, slides were treated with Escherichia coli-derived RNase I (100 μg/ml; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or bovine pancreas-derived RQ1 DNase I (100 units/ml, Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to HRG binding and detection. Binding of HRG to Necrotic Cells Is Heparan Sulfate-independent and Is Mediated by Its N1N2 Domain—Our laboratory recently demonstrated that HRG binds to cell surface heparan sulfate on viable cells via its N1N2 domain and that this binding is almost entirely abolished by high concentrations of heparin (16Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30114-30122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). While investigating the binding of HRG to transfected cell lines exposed to selective antibiotics, it was noted that the late stage apoptotic cells produced by antibiotic selection exhibited enhanced binding of HRG that was not inhibited by heparin (data not shown). A previous report suggested that HRG interacts with late stage apoptotic cells (29Gorgani N.N. Smith B.A. Kono D.H. Theofilopoulos A.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4745-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but we wished to further investigate the molecular basis of this phenomenon and determine whether HRG can interact with necrotic and early stage apoptotic cells. CHO cell lines that either express cell surface GAGs (CHO-KI) or lack cell surface GAGs (pgsA-745) due to a deficiency in xylosyltransferase (38Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 39Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used in these initial experiments. GAG+ve and GAG-ve CHO cells were induced into necrosis by exposure of the cells to hyperthermic conditions (56 °C) for 45 min. Cell death was confirmed as >99% using the DNA intercalating dye 7-AAD with viability being assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). Both viable and necrotic GAG+ve and GAG-ve CHO cells were analyzed for their capacity to bind HRG. In agreement with previous findings (16Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30114-30122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), viable GAG+ve CHO cells bound human HRG (100 μg/ml), binding that was almost entirely abolished by the presence of 12.5-kDa bovine lung heparin (100 μg/ml) (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, HRG exhibited little binding to viable GAG-ve CHO cells either in the presence or absence of heparin (Fig. 1, B and C). On the other hand, HRG bound strongly to necrotic GAG+ve CHO cells at levels 2-3-fold higher than to viable GAG+ve CHO cells. Binding to necrotic GAG-ve CHO cells was at least 100-fold higher than binding to viable GAG-ve CHO cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Necrotic cell binding was only partially inhibited by heparin (∼20-30%), suggesting that the majority of HRG binding to necrotic cells is mediated through a heparan sulfate-independent ligand. We have previously shown that heparan sulfate-mediated HRG binding to viable cells is highly dependent on the presence of physiological concentrations of free Zn2+ (20 μm) (16Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30114-30122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HRG binding to necrotic cells is not dependent on the presence of physiological concentrations of free Zn2+ (data not shown), indicating that HRG binding to necrotic cells is Zn2+-independent. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize the binding of HRG to both viable and hyperthermia-induced necrotic CHO cells using the HRG-specific mAb HRG-4 (Fig. 1D). Viable GAG+ve CHO cells exhibited HRG binding (green) that was predominantly localized to the outer surface of all viable cells. As expected, viable GAG-ve CHO cells did not exhibit HRG binding (data not shown). Conversely, HRG binding to necrotic GAG+ve (data not shown) and GAG-ve CHO cells was localized within the cytoplasm, but not the nucleus (Fig. 1D). Necrotic cells exhibited positive nuclei staining for the DNA intercalating dye 7-AAD, whereas viable cells were negative for 7-AAD staining (Fig. 1D). Recombinant full-length and the amino-terminal (N1N2) domain of HRG were produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system as previously described (16Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30114-30122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry studies were performed to determine whether the N1N2 domain of HRG also binds to necrotic cells. In agreement with our previous studies (16Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30114-30122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the N1N2 domain bound to viable GAG+ve CHO cells, binding that was completely inhibited by 12.5-kDa bovine lung heparin (100 μg/ml) (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with this observation, the N1N2 domain of HRG did not bind to GAG-deficient CHO cells (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the N1N2 domain of HRG exhibited comparable binding to both necrotic GAG+ve and GAG-ve CHO cells, binding that was not blocked by heparin (Fig. 2, A and B). Again, binding was not affected by the presence of physiological concentrations of Zn2+ (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that the N1N2 domain of HRG interacts with necrotic cells and that the necrotic cell ligand is unrelated to heparan sulfate. HRG Binds Poorly to Early Stage Apoptotic Cells—The capacity of HRG to bind to early stage (6 h) apoptotic (pre-necrotic) cells was then investigated. Jurkat T cells were induced into early stage apoptosis (1 μm camptothecin, 6 h, 37 °C), and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for Annexin-V binding and uptake of the DNA intercalating dye 7-AAD. Viable cells were defined as 7-AAD- and Annexin-V-negative, early stage apoptotic cells (30% of camptothecin-treated cells) were classified as Annexin-V-positive, 7-AAD-negative, and necrotic cells (hyperthermia treatment) were identified as 7-AAD-positive, Annexin-V-negative (Fig. 3A). The ability of HRG to bind to early stage apoptotic cells, compared with viable or necrotic cells, and the effect of heparin on this binding was then assessed. In contrast to viable cells, early stage apoptotic cells exhibited very low levels of HRG binding that was marginally affected by heparin, whereas necrotic cells bound high levels of HRG that was also only slightly affected by heparin (Fig. 3, B and C). Based on reactivity with a heparan sulfate-specific mAb, early stage apoptotic cells were also shown to exhibit very low levels of cell surface heparan sulfate (data not shown). Thus the predominant cell surface ligand for HRG is lost from early stage apoptotic cells, a process that results in these cells reacting very weakly with HRG. Furthermore, Jurkat cells behave in a similar manner to GAG+ve CHO cells in that when they are necrotic they bind HRG in a heparan sulfate-independent manner. These binding data also suggest that the ligand recognized by HRG in necrotic cells is not exposed until the cell membrane has become permeable, allowing HRG access to cytoplasmic ligands within necrotic cells. Early stage apoptotic cells have intact cell membranes and thus do not appear to allow HRG access to the cytoplasmic ligands. HRG Binds Specifically to an Intracellular Cytoplasmic Ligand via Its N1N2 Domain—Based on the above data, experiments were under-taken to characterize the interaction of HRG with intracellular ligands within necrotic cells. Our confocal studies (Fig. 1D) indicated that HRG interacts with necrotic cells via a cytoplasmic ligand. To confirm this observation, we examined the binding of HRG to monolayers of fixed human HEp-2 epithelial cells. This fixed epithelial cell line is routinely used clinically to screen for anti-nuclear antibodies that are present in the sera of systemic lupus erythematosus patients. It was found that both recombinant full-length HRG and the N1N2 domain of HRG bound uniformly to the cytoplasm of the HEp-2 cells, with no binding being detected in the cell nuclei (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the HRG ligand is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of cells. Treatment of the slides with RNase (100 μg/ml), DNase I (100 units/ml), and co-incubation of HRG with 12.5-kDa bovine lung heparin (100 μg/ml) or tropomyosin (200 μg/ml) did not modify the intensity or binding pattern of HRG or the N1N2 domain (data not shown), suggesting that the cytoplasmic ligand for HRG is unrelated to RNA, DNA, heparin-like molecules, or tropomyosin. As a specificity control, the binding of an irrelevant protein (OVA) to the HEp-2 cells was examined. OVA did not show any detectable binding to the fixed epithelial cells when incubated at similar concentrations to HRG (Fig. 4B), indicat"

Two proteins involved in phagocytosis, CD44 and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, are γ-secretase substrates, suggesting that this complex might regulate some aspects of phagocytosis. Our results indicate that the four components of γ-secretase, viz. presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, are present and enriched on phagosome membranes from both murine macrophages and Drosophila S2 phagocytes. The γ-secretase components form high molecular mass complexes in lipid microdomains of the phagosome membrane with the topology expected for the functional enzyme. In contrast to the majority of the phagosome proteins studied so far, which appear to associate transiently with this organelle, γ-secretase resides on newly formed phagosomes and remains associated throughout their maturation into phagolysosomes. Finally, our results indicate that interferon-γ stimulates γ-secretase-dependent cleavages on phagosomes and that γ-secretase activity may be involved in the phagocytic response of macrophages to inflammatory cytokines. γ-Secretase is a high molecular mass protein complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of its protein substrates.

Kopan R. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase activity was later found to function in Notch signaling by releasing the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of target genes (2Selkoe D. Kopan R. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Several other γ-secretase substrates, including CD44, Notch ligands, and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP; also known as CD91), have been identified, and all share a common type I transmembrane protein topology (3Koo E.H. Kopan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S26-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase cleavage of these substrates is preceded by proteolysis within their extracellular domains (3Koo E.H. Kopan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S26-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the biological function of γ-secretase cleavage remains to be deciphered for many substrates, recent evidence indicates that the role of γ-secretase in signal transduction may not be limited to the Notch pathway. Other γ-secretase substrates, including APP, CD44, and LRP, have indeed been shown to generate transcriptionally active C-terminal fragments (4Cao X. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Cumulative evidence indicates that γ-secretase consists of a high molecular mass complex composed of at least four different proteins, viz. presenilin (PS)-1 or the less abundant homolog PS2, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, all of which are integral membrane proteins (8Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Current models propose that PS1 contains the catalytic site of γ-secretase, an unusual aspartyl protease with two aspartates located in transmembrane domains 6 and 7 of PS1, respectively (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Nicastrin and APH-1 are suggested to function in stabilizing and trafficking full-length PS1 through the secretory pathway (10LaVoie M.J. Fraering P.C. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37213-37222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PS1 undergoes endoproteolysis in its cytoplasmic loop, located between transmembrane domains 6 and 7, generating the N-terminal (NTF) and C-terminal (CTF) fragments, which remain associated in the complex (11Thinakaran G.

PEN-2 apparently promotes this cleavage event, a key step in the activation of γ-secretase (13Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T.

Although the assembly of a functional γ-secretase complex can occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (18Kim S.H. Yin Y.I. Li Y.-M. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether γ-secretase cleavage events occur at the plasma membrane, given that the endocytosis of Notch has recently been described as a prerequisite for its processing by γ-secretase (20Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis is a process used by a wide range of organisms, from amoeba to vertebrates, to internalize large particles, typically the size of 1 μm or more (21Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 825-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Newly formed phagosomes engage in a maturation process that involves fusion with endosomes of increasing age and ultimately with lysosomes. The killing of phagocytosed microbes in mammalian professional phagocytes such as macrophages forms the first line of defense against infectious diseases. Microbe degradation in the phagosome produces protein antigens, which are presented at the cell surface to activate specific lymphocytes and elicit appropriate immune responses. Phagosome-associated functions are thus important participants in the immune system. At least two acknowledged substrates of γ-secretase, CD44 and LRP (also known as CD91) (3Koo E.H. Kopan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S26-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), are involved in phagocytosis and are known residents of phagosome membranes (22Leemans J.C. Florquin S. Heikens M.

These findings prompted us to investigate if the γ-secretase complex localizes to phagosomes and hence if γ-secretase cleavage events occur on this compartment. In this study, we show that all of the components of the γ-secretase reside on phagosomes of both murine macrophages and Drosophila phagocytic cells. The biochemical characterization of γ-secretase on phagosomes demonstrates that γ-secretase associates with lipid rafts on phagosome membranes, is present predominantly as a high molecular mass complex of 440 kDa, and catalyzes γ-secretase-specific cleavages on phagosomes. Our results show that the γ-secretase complex is an abundant, stable, and conserved component of phagosomes, suggesting that γ-secretase actively regulates some of the functions of this highly specialized organelle.

The cells were lysed in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using a 22-gauge 112-inch needle. The post-nuclear supernatant was adjusted to 40% sucrose; placed on a cushion of 62% sucrose; and layered with a sucrose gradient composed of 35, 25, and 10% layers. After centrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 1 h, the isolated phagosomes were collected at the 10-25% sucrose interface. To isolate the total cell membranes, post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h onto a 62% sucrose cushion. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Phagosome proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and 1-mm-wide bands were excised and trypsin-digested. The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted with 0.2 m urea in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and analyzed by nanoscale liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry using a Waters capillary liquid chromatograph coupled to a Q-Tof Ultima mass spectrometer. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Purified phagosomes or total cell membranes were resuspended in Laemmli lysis buffer prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The amount of proteins and latex beads in the samples was quantified using an EZQ™ protein quantification kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and by spectrophotometry, respectively. Deglycosylation Assay—The glycosylation pattern of nicastrin was examined by treating phagosome protein extracts with endoglycosidase H or peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence—Phagosomes were formed by the internalization of 3-μm latex beads (Estapor® microspheres) for 1 h, and purified phagosomes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (PBS/bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 4°C. The phagosomes were washed with PBS/bovine serum albumin and further incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunolabeled phagosomes were washed with PBS/bovine serum albumin and observed using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope. Pronase Assay—To determine the sensitivity of phagosome-associated proteins to Pronase, purified phagosomes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with Pronase (Sigma), which consists of a mixture of proteases, as described previously (29Dermine J.-F. Duclos S. Garin J. St. Louis F. Rea S. Parton R.G. Desjardins M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18507-18512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of phagosomes were treated in parallel with or without Pronase and subjected to SDS-PAGE prior to Western blotting. Lipid Raft Isolation—Lipid rafts were isolated from purified phagosomes as described previously (29Dermine J.-F. Duclos S. Garin J. St. Louis F. Rea S. Parton R.G. Desjardins M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18507-18512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Briefly, phagosome membranes were incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.5% CHAPS for 30 min on ice. Lipid rafts were separated from the solubilized membranes by floatation on an OptiPrep™ gradient, from which seven equivalent fractions were collected. The proteins in each fraction were precipitated with methanol/chloroform and resuspended in Laemmli lysis buffer. Blue Native (BN) PAGE—For BN-PAGE, the γ-secretase protein complexes were isolated from purified phagosomes by detergent solubilization in 0.5% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. The solubilized fractions were subjected to BN-PAGE as described (30Schagger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, either the gel was transferred directly to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting, or a lane of the gel was subjected to Tricine/SDS-PAGE prior to Western blotting. γ-Secretase Activity—To assess the generation of the APP CTFγ (the C-terminal product of APP cleavage by γ-secretase (43Yu C. Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Xu H. Gasparini L. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43756-43760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)), purified phagosomes were resuspended in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and aliquots were incubated at either 4 °C or 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli lysis buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of APP CTFs was analyzed by Western blotting. γ-Secretase enzyme activity was also monitored with a fluorescent polymer superquenching-based assay using a peptide containing the sequence GVVIATVK flanked by biotin and a fluorescence quencher (QTL Lightspeed™ γ-secretase assay, QTL Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein contents in total cell membranes or in purified 1-h-old phagosomes were quantified in purified phagosomes or in total cell membranes. Increasing amounts of membranes or of purified phagosomes were incubated with the peptide substrate for 3 h at 37°C in the absence or presence of 1 μm L-685,458 (γ-secretase inhibitor X), and the fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax GeminiEM instrument (Molecular Devices Corp.). In a recent proteomic analysis of purified latex bead-containing phagosomes, we identified >500 proteins on this organelle by mass spectrometry (31Garin J. Diez R. Kieffer S. Dermine J.-F. Duclos S. Gagnon E. Sadoul R. Rondeau C. Desjardins M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 32Brunet S. Thibault P. Gagnon E. Kearney P. Bergeron J.J. Desjardins M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed the presence of four of the components of the γ-secretase complex, viz. PS1, PS2, nicastrin, and APH-1 (TABLE ONE). To assess the significance of these observations, the relative abundance of γ-secretase components in phagosomes compared with a total cell lysate and a total cell membrane preparation was determined. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, PS1, nicastrin, and PEN-2 were highly enriched on phagosome membranes. The PS1 NTF and CTF were clearly the predominant forms of PS1 compared with full-length PS1 (Fig. 1A), indicating that mainly the processed form of PS1 localizes to phagosomes. Likewise, the deglycosylation profile of nicastrin indicated that nicastrin was present in its mature glycosylated form (Fig. 1B). The slight shift in molecular mass observed after treatment with endoglycosidase H is expected of highly glycosylated proteins such as nicastrin (33Yang D.S. Tandon A. Chen F. Yu G. Yu H. Arawaka S. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Schmidt S.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Nixon R.A. Mathews P.M. Gandy S.E. Mount H.T.J. St. George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28135-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The PS1 CTF on phagosomes was present in three distinct bands, possibly corresponding to a previously characterized phosphorylated form of the PS1 CTF (highest band) and a product of PS1 CTF cleavage by caspase-3 (lowest band) (see Fig. 6B) (34Saura C.A. Tomita T. Soriano S. Takahashi M. Leem J.Y. Honda T. Koo E.H. Iwatsubo T. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17136-17142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nicastrin and PS1 were also detected by immunofluorescent labeling of isolated phagosomes (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the uniform Lamp1 labeling of the phagosome surface, PS1 and nicastrin labeling was often observed in patches on phagosomes (Fig. 1C, insets), a pattern that may reflect the association of γ-secretase components with lipid microdomains (see Fig. 4).TABLE ONEPeptides of the γ-secretase protein complex identified on the phagosomes of murine J774 macrophages and Drosophila S2 cells by MS-MS analysisProteinSwiss-Prot accession no.PeptidesJ774 macrophagesAPH-1Q8BVF7KADEGLASLSEDGRADEGLASLSEDGRPresenilin-1P49769MLVETAQERAAVQELSGSILTSEDPEERKDGQLIYTPFTEDTETVGQRNicastrinP57716LENIDSFVELGQVALRSGAGVPEVVLRLLYGFLVRMVYDMENGKFPVRNQVEDLLATLEKALANVATVLARNVMFVFFQGETFDYIGSSRAPDVTTLSRFPVRLENIDSFVELGQVALRLAQSQALPPSSLQRDrosophila S2 cellsPresenilin homologO02194ATQNSLASPEAAAASGQRLTGGGGGSGGPPTNEMEEEQGLKNicastrin homologQ9VC27LLGYLLSQLQPDIHRAASYPGSQLTNLPPMRYISVLGGSQESSGYTYRCFQDFNNHNYETHALRNVYATLYPRSLNPDSLQMK Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6IFN-γ increases the γ-secretase cleavage of LRP on phagosomes.

Western blotting was performed for the indicated proteins. The cleavage product of the PS1 CTF by caspase-3 is indicated by the asterisk.

Purified 1-h-old phagosomes from J774 cells were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 (A) or 0.5% CHAPS (B). Following the floatation of the detergent-resistant membranes (rafts) on an OptiPrep gradient, seven fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Equivalent volumes from each fraction were loaded in each lane, and Western blotting was performed for the indicated proteins. Lamp1 and flotillin are shown as a controls for non-raft- and raft-associated proteins, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) γ-Secretase components are highly conserved proteins from worms to mammals (1Xia W. Wolfe M.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2839-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine whether the localization of γ-secretase to phagosomes was conserved as well, phagosomes were purified from Drosophila S2 cells, known to exhibit efficient phagocytic properties (35Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A. Nature. 2002; 416 (R. A. B.): 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase protein homologs were identified on Drosophila S2 phagosomes both by mass spectrometry (TABLE ONE) and by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). Similar to the distribution of γ-secretase in mammalian macrophages (Fig. 1A), γ-secretase components were enriched on phagosomes from S2 cells compared with a total membrane preparation (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the function of γ-secretase on phagosomes has been evolutionarily conserved. Phagolysosome biogenesis and maturation involves complex changes in the protein composition of phagosomes (36Desjardins M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For instance, Rab5 rapidly associates with nascent phagosomes but dissociates from maturing phagosomes, whereas maturing phagosomes progressively recruit Lamp1 (Fig. 2). In contrast to Rab5 and Lamp1, the proteins of the γ-secretase complex remained abundant and stable on phagosomes throughout their maturation into phagolysosomes (Fig. 2). The dynamics of γ-secretase association with phagosomes also demonstrate that the complex is not targeted to phagosomes simply to be degraded. These results indicate an enrichment of the γ-secretase complex on late phagosome membranes. In contrast, nicastrin displayed a much greater enrichment than PS1 on purified lysosomes (19Pasternak S.H. Bagshaw R.D. Guiral M. Zhang S. Ackerley C.A. Pak B.J. Callahan J.W. Mahuran D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26687-26694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As late phagosomes and lysosomes may interact with different intracellular compartments, the cellular origin of the γ-secretase complex found on these distinct organelles could differ, and γ-secretase components may thus be present in different proportions. Purified latex bead-containing phagosomes constitute a unique tool to determine the membrane topology of resident proteins. The"

Here we report how this balance may be influenced by novel alterations in the efficiency of Stat1 signaling. To enable disulfide-dependent and spontaneous formation of active Stat1 homodimer (as was done previously for Stat3), we engineered Stat1-CC with double-cysteine substitutions in the Src homology 2 (SH2)-homodimerization domain (at Ala-656 and Asn-658). In this case, however, mutant and wild-type Stat1 exhibited no difference inspontaneousdimerization. Moreover, Stat1-CC still required ligand-dependent Tyr-701 phosphorylation for function and exhibited hyperresponsiveness to IFN-β (that depends on Stat1/Stat2 heterodimerization) as well as IFN-γ (that depends on Stat1/Stat1 homodimerization). Hyperresponsivenss of Stat1-CC was accompanied by increased capacities for Tyr-701 phosphorylation and DNA binding, but these features were also found in a similarly substituted serine mutant (Stat1-SS) that showed no hyperresponsiveness to IFN-γ. This finding raised the possibility that SH2 domain mutations also influence downstream transcriptional efficiency. Indeed, each of these mutations also enhanced recruitment of the normally rate-limiting p300/CREB-binding Protein (CBP) coactivator to the transcriptional complex in proportion to the level of IFN-driven transactivation and gene expression. Additional modifications indicated that the mutant residues in the SH2 domain appeared to cooperate with Ser-727 in the C-terminal domain to regulate p300/CBP interaction with Stat1. The profile of IFN responsiveness translated into the same progressive increase in the level of viral clearance from Stat1- to Stat1-SS- to Stat1-CC-expressing cells. Thus, SH2 domain determinants may be modified to direct better Stat1 phosphorylation, DNA binding, and coactivator recruitment to fully improve IFN efficacy.

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 2Dunn G.P. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 2004; 21: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). The protective actions of IFN rely on signaling through two IFN receptors (IFNAR for type I and IFNGR for type II IFNs, respectively) and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway that includes receptor-associated JAK and STAT as well as downstream transcription factors, enhancers, and co-activators (3Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). For type I IFN (IFN-α/β), receptor-associated Jak1 and Tyk2 mediate the assembly of Stat1/Stat2 heterodimers that in concert with IRF-9 binds to ISRE promoter sites of IFN-α/β-responsive genes. For type II IFN (IFN-γ), receptor-associated Jak1 and Jak2 mediate formation of Stat1/Stat1 homodimers that bind to GAS sites of IFN-γ-responsive genes. For both STAT complexes, the subsequent recruitment of p300/CBP coactivators as well as other factors allows for transcription and consequent gene expression (4Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W.

Despite the complexity in IFN signaling, the Stat1 transcription factor is remarkable as a critical functional component common to both type I and type II IFN signaling pathways. Indeed, the phenotype for viral infection of Stat1-null mice exhibits striking similarity to the one observed for loss of both type I and II IFN-receptor signaling (8Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R.

Susceptibility to viral infection is markedly increased in humans with mutations that inactivate Stat1 function (12Dupuis S. Dargemont C. Fieschi C. Thomassin N. Rosenzweig S. Harris J. Holland S.M.

By contrast, Stat1 activation (and Stat1-dependent gene expression) are detected in neoplasia and are invariably increased in asthmatic subjects (14Zong C. Yan R. August A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Frank D.A. Mahajan S. Ritz J. J. Clin.

Analogous to the findings in neoplasia, Stat1 activation in asthma developed despite normal tissue levels of IFN and so was also labeled as constitutive. In both conditions, the teleological basis for altered Stat1 behavior under pathologic conditions is uncertain but may represent an attempt to improve immune surveillance. This possibility led us to question whether this signaling component of the immune system might be genetically engineered to better benefit the host compared with native Stat1 signaling. The present experiments were therefore initiated to generate a Stat1 molecule with enhanced IFN responsiveness. In that context, we recognized that others have used crystal structures for Stat1, Stat3, and Stat4 as a guide (19Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W.

In the present study, however, we discover that double cysteine-substituted Stat1 (designated Stat1-CC) exhibited little constitutive activity or dimerization and was unexpectedly hyperresponsive to IFN-β as well as IFN-γ through a mechanism that in all cases still required ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. Comparison to a double serine-substituted Stat1 (Stat1-SS) provided further insight into mechanism of action and focused attention at the level of transcriptional coactivator recruitment at a site, i.e. SH2 domain, that is distinct from previous studies of native or modified STAT function (22Bromberg J.F.

We also took advantage of our findings to broadly enhance IFN function in cells that express the Stat1-CC and Stat1-SS mutants to further highlight the importance of this mechanism whereby coactivator recruitment is rate-limiting for gene expression and consequent immune function. The apparent hyperresponsiveness of Stat1 found in inflammatory disease may therefore represent an attempt to evolve Stat1 signaling capacity in this natural setting as well.

Full-length Stat1, Stat1-SS, or Stat1-CC with or without C-terminal 3×Flag reporter sequence as well as the corresponding double mutants with Ser-727 to Ala-727 substitution were inserted into retroviral vector MSCV2.2 (obtained from K. M. Murphy, Washington University) or Mx-neo (obtained from T. Kitamura, University of Tokyo) to generate the following vectors: Stat1-IRES-GFP, Stat1-Flag-IRES-GFP, and Stat1(S727A)-Flag-IRES-GFP; Stat1-SS-IRES-GFP, Stat1-SS-Flag-IRES-GFP, and Stat1(S727A)-SS-Flag-IRES-GFP; and Stat1-CC-IRES-GFP, Stat1-CC-Flag-IRES-GFP, and Stat1(S727A)-CC-Flag-IRES-GFP or Mx-Stat1-Flag-neo and Mx-Stat1-CC-Flag-neo (Fig. 1). For transactivation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we also generated Stat1, Stat1-SS, or Stat1-CC cDNA with C-terminal GFP sequence to generate Stat1-GFP, Stat1-SS-GFP, and Stat1-CC-GFP vectors. A cDNA fragment for Stat1 and Stat1-CC encoding a Tyr-701 to Phe-701 substitution was similarly used to generate vectors encoding Stat1(Y701F)-GFP or Stat1(Y701F)-CC-GFP, and these vectors along with Stat1- and Stat1CC-GFP vectors were used to test the requirement for Tyr-701 phosphorylation. Stat1-deficient U3A and Type I IFNAR2-deficient U5A cells were obtained from G. Stark (Cleveland Clinic). The Phoenix-Ampho packaging cell line was obtained from G. Nolan (Stanford University) and transfected as described previously (33Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To generate cells expressing Stat1-GFP and Stat1-Flag or Stat1-CC-GFP and Stat1-CC-Flag, we transfected Mx-Stat1-Flag-neo or Mx-Stat1-CC-Flag-neo into MSCV-Stat1-GFP or MSCV-Stat1-CC-GFP-expressing U3A cells, selected transduced cells in G418, and verified similar expression levels by Western blotting for Flag and GFP. Analysis of Stat1-dependent Gene Expression—For flow cytometry, samples of 1 × 105 cells were treated with or without recombinant human IFN-γ (Genentech) or IFN-β (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) and analyzed for expression of ICAM-1 or Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) using phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-1 mAb 84H10 or HLA-A,B,C mAb from Pharmingen and a FACScan interfaced to CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For real-time PCR, target mRNA levels were quantified with 5′-GGAAGGGAAATTACCTGAGGACAT-3′ and 5′-CCTTCCCATCCACGTTTGTT-3′ for IRF-1 or 5′-CTCACCTGATGAGAATGAGAATGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTCAGGGAGTATGTCAGGTACTC-3′ for GBP as forward and reverse primers in the TaqMan One-Step system (PE Biosystems) with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (nucleotides 37-910) serving as a control. Analysis of Stat1 Activation and Dimerization—For Western blotting, cells were lysed as described previously (34Walter M.J. Look D.C. Tidwell R.M. Roswit W.T. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol.

For phosphatase sensitivity assays, cell lysates were prepared in buffer without sodium orthovanadate, sodium pyrophosphate, or sodium fluoride and then incubated with the 45-kDa splice variant of T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (Tc-PTP; New England BioLabs) for 1 h at 30 °C. For Stat1 co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with agarose beads conjugated to anti-Stat1 Ab (10 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and for dimerization detection, cell lysates were incubated with anti-GFP Ab or anti-FLAG Ab followed by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (1 ng) containing the GAS motif from human ICAM-1 gene promoter, the ISRE motif from ISG15 gene promoter, or the GAS motif from the M67-SIE probe as described previously (7Look D.C.

Analysis of Stat1-Coactivator Interaction—For luciferase reporter gene transactivation assays, Stat1-GFP, Stat1-SS-GFP, or Stat1-CC-GFP in MSCV2.2 (0.5 μg) was co-transfected with pGAS-Luciferase or pISRE-Luciferase plasmid (1 μg, Stratagene) into U3A cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, transfected cells were treated with IFN-γ (100 units/ml) or IFN-β (1000 units/ml) for 12 h and then split into aliquots for analysis of luciferase activity according to the manufacture's instructions (Promega) and GFP level by flow cytometry. GFP level was used to correct for transfection efficiency. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, Stat1-Flag-IRES-GFP, Stat1-SS-Flag-IRES-GFP, or Stat1-CC-Flag-IRES-GFP-expressing U3A cells were treated with IFN-γ or IFN-β for 30 min at 37 °C (1 × 106 cells/condition), incubated with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 25 °C to cross-link protein-DNA and protein-protein complexes. The cell lysate was sonicated to yield DNA fragments from 200-1000 bp, debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted 1:10 (v/v). An aliquot was kept as a loading control for input/sample. Remaining supernatant was incubated with anti-Stat1 or control mouse IgG-agarose beads (5 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and salmon sperm DNA (20 μg) for 16-h rotation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation, and a 10% aliquot was analyzed by real-time PCR using primers for human IRF-1 promoter (forward and reverse primer pairs: 5′-CTTCGCCGCTAGCTCTAC-3′ and 5′-CCCATTGGCCGGCTGCGT-3′) that binds Stat1/Stat1 and Stat1/Stat2 dimers (37Li X.

For protein-protein interaction with ChIP, cell lysates were sheared using a 29-gauge syringe instead of sonication and incubated with agarose beads conjugated to anti-Flag Ab (20 μl, Sigma) or anti-p300 Ab (5 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Stat1, anti-phospho-Stat1, anti-Stat2, anti-phospho-Stat2 Ab, or anti-p300 Ab as described above. Viral Inoculation and Monitoring—Mouse encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV, VR-129B) was obtained from ATCC and used to inoculate cell cultures as described previously (38Lo M.S. Brazas R.M. Holtzman M.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9315-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR for EMCV was performed using 5′-CTGCCTTCGGTGTCGC-3′ and 5′-TGGGTCGAATCAAAGTTGGAG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Flow cytometry to monitor cell viability was performed using propidium iodide staining as described previously (39Jayaraman S. Castro M. O'Sullivan M. Bragdon M.J. Holtzman M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1717-1722PubMed Google Scholar). Stat1 Hyperresponsiveness to Type I and II IFN—We first generated a Stat1 mutant (Stat1-CC) with double-cysteine substitutions at sites (Ala-656 and Asn-658) where the C-terminal domains of the Stat1 homodimer are in close proximity. This mutation was expected to allow for spontaneous disulfide bonding and Stat1 homodimerization as described for Stat3 (22Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y.H. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also generated a Stat1 mutant (Stat1-SS) with homologous serine substitutions to confer similar steric effects but no capacity for possible disulfide bond formation. Functional activity of wild-type and mutant Stat1 proteins were compared after stable expression in Stat1-deficient U3A cells, where mutant Stat1 was expressed similarly to wild type. In contrast to predictions, we found no spontaneous expression of IFN-γ-responsive genes in Stat1-CC-expressing cells (as exemplified by unchanged basal ICAM-1 gene expression in Fig. 2) but instead found increased responsiveness to IFN-γ in Stat1-CC-versus Stat1-SS- or Stat1-expressing cells (exemplified by increased IFN-γ-induction of ICAM-1 and MHC Class I gene expression in Fig. 2). In addition, we found that Stat1-CC conferred increased responsiveness of IFN-β-inducible genes at baseline and after IFN-β treatment (as exemplified by basal and IFN-β-inducible MHC Class I gene expression in Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, hyperresponsiveness of IFN-β-inducible genes was also present in Stat1-SS-expressing cells, although at an intermediate level between Stat1- and Stat1-CC-expressing cells. As developed below, each of these findings suggested an alternative mechanism to the one proposed for spontaneous disulfide-dependent dimerization of Stat3. Mutant Stat1 Requirement for Activation—Although we detected no constitutive expression of IFN-γ-responsive genes (e.g. ICAM-1), we did find low level induction of IFN-β-responsive genes (e.g. MHC Class I) even without IFN treatment. To determine whether this basal activity might be due to spontaneous dimerization of Stat1-CC (allowing for signaling without phosphorylation), we next generated a Stat1-CC protein with mutation of the Tyr-701 that is required for ligand-dependent dimerization of Stat1. This Stat1-CC-Y701F mutant, unlike Stat1 or Stat1-CC, did not respond to IFN-γ or IFN-β stimulation (Fig. 3a.b). In addition, the increased basal level of MHC Class I gene expression observed with Stat1-CC transduction was completely abolished by the introduction of this mutation (Fig. 3b). This requirement for Tyr-701 phosphorylation suggested to us that low level Stat1-CC activity at base line might be due to small amounts of constitutive production of IFN-β. In accordance with this hypothesis, the increased basal expression activity was also lost when Stat1-CC was expressed in IFNAR-deficient U5A cells that are unable to respond to IFN-β (Fig. 3c). Thus, the low level of Stat1-CC action under base-line conditions appears to depend on similarly low levels of endogenous type I IFN release under control conditions. Indeed, under the present cell culture conditions, we found low basal levels of IFN-β mRNA that did not vary significantly with retroviral transduction but were inducible with viral infection (data not shown). The capacity of Stat1-CC to enhance IFN-β-dependent signaling thereby explained the basal activity in Stat1-CC-expressing cells as being driven by constitutive release of IFN-β. Mutant Stat1 Capacities for Dimerization, Tyrosine Phosphorylation, and DNA Binding—In view of the apparent absence of spontaneous function for mutant Stat1, we next conducted experiments to more directly monitor dimerization of wild-type and mutant Stat1 proteins. Accordingly, we labeled both wild-type and mutant Stat1 with distinct tags (GFP or Flag) to monitor the capacity of each Stat1 species for dimerization. In the case of spontaneous dimerization, we found no difference in behavior between wild-type Stat1 and Stat1-CC (Fig. 4). For each species of Stat1, we detected a low level of spontaneous dimerization that is likely mediated by N-domain dependent interactions (40Ota N. Brett T.J. Murphy T.L. Fremont D.H. Murphy K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 41Zhong M. Henriksen M.A. Takeuchi K. Schaefer O. Liu B. ten Hoeve J. Ren Z. Mao X. Chen X. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and so is apparently unaffected by the present mutation in the SH2 domain. By contrast, in the case of IFN-γ stimulation, we detected an increase in Stat1-CC compared with wild-type Stat1 dimerization (Fig. 4). This finding is again consistent with increases in IFN-inducible gene expression for mutant versus wild-type Stat1. Based on the requirement for Tyr-701 phosphorylation for mutant Stat1 function, we next assessed the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation behavior of wild-type and mutant Stat1 proteins. Assessments of nuclear retention, tyrosine phosphorylation, and DNA binding each provided evidence of prolonged activation for Stat1-CC and Stat1-SS in comparison to wild-type Stat1. Thus, Stat1 and Stat1-CC displayed similar localization to the cytoplasmic compartment under baseline conditions (without IFN treatment), but Stat1-CC was retained in the nucleus significantly longer than Stat1 in response to IFN-γ or IFN-β (data not shown). Nuclear retention was accompanied by prolonged Tyr-701 phosphorylation of mutant relative to wild-type Stat1 in response to IFN-γ or IFN-β (Fig. 5a). Prolonged Tyr-701 phosphorylation was likely based on resistance to Stat1 dephosphorylation, since initial phosphorylation levels were similar for wild-type and mutant Stat1, and any later increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This possibility is further developed below by testing sensitivity to phosphatase treatment. In concert with prolonged Tyr-701 phosphorylation, we also found increased and prolonged DNA binding of each mutant Stat1 compared with wild-type Stat1 proteins (Fig. 5b). However, neither increased nuclear retention, Tyr-701 phosphorylation, nor DNA-binding was sufficient to fully explain increased function of the present Stat1 mutations. Thus, the level of Stat1-SS DNA binding is increased after IFN-γ, but Stat1-SS exhibits no increase in IFN-γ-responsiveness; in contrast, the level of Stat1-SS DNA binding is only marginally increased after IFN-β, but Stat1-SS exhibits a significant increase in IFN-β-responsiveness. These findings indicated that Stat1 DNA-binding was dissociated from transcriptional activity under some circumstances and so prompted further experiments aimed at defining additional mechanisms for mutant Stat1 hyperresponsiveness to IFN. To better define the mechanisms for IFN responsiveness, we considered whether Stat1-CC exhibits higher affinity for Stat2 or how it might otherwise protect Stat2 from dephosphorylation. We first found that Stat2 affinity appeared similar for Stat1, Stat1-SS, and Stat1-CC, since the levels of IFN-β-inducible interaction were similar at early times (0.3 h) before dephosphorylation becomes significant (Fig. 6a).

The C-terminal catalytic region of OGT contains two conserved domains known as CD I and CD II (37Roos M.D. Hanover J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), originally identified by their organizational similarity with the catalytic domain and lectin domain of the GalNAc transferases (38Hagen F.K.

Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The two conserved domains of OGT also show similarities to glycosyltransferases that have a single monosaccharide-binding site. Our aim was to perform a mutational analysis of residues in the C-terminal catalytic domain that may be important for UDP-GlcNAc sensing, thus providing information regarding the catalytic roles of CD I and CD II. To identify potentially important amino acid residues that could be targeted for mutagenesis, sequence comparisons were made with OGT homologues, as well as with other glycosyltransferase families for which a mechanism has been proposed for catalytic function (38Hagen F.K.

The approach taken was to make single amino acid substitutions at conserved residues in both the CD I and CD II regions of human mOGT (1Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), followed by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Because E. coli does not possess a gene for OGT, any OGT activity recovered from these extracts is due to expression of the recombinant enzyme. E. coli extracts were used in an in vitro assay system, where wild type mOGT and mutant OGT enzymes were tested for their ability to glycosylate Nup62, a nuclear pore protein known to be an excellent OGT substrate. Here we show that many of the amino acid substitutions made in both the CD I and CD II domains of OGT are critical for function and may be involved in either maintaining structure or catalysis. Most of the residues mutated in OGT were inactive; however, two amino acids in CD I (Asp422 and Tyr434) and one amino acid in CD II (Phe752) retained similar levels of enzyme activity as wild type. Homology modeling of these residues to other glycosyltransferases in the glycogen phosphorylase superfamily suggests that they may be either in or close to the active site of the enzyme. These results provide important new insights into the structure/function of this enzyme and may help understand the mechanism by which OGT recognizes UDP-GlcNAc and catalyzes transfer to substrate proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Thirty mOGT single point mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (see TABLE ONE), with the pET-32 human mOGT expression vector (1Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) as a template. The sequence was confirmed in each case and was shown to produce an open reading frame with the appropriate amino acid change.TABLE ONEOGT mutant constructs for CD I and CD II Amino acid substitutions made to residues in the CD I and CD II domains of OGT are shown.CD ICD IIY387AF721AG402SW735AD407AW748AD422AF752AY434AF776AD438AL796AF439AW812AG453SC836SF460AC839SG472AW878AE482AD488AD505AW536AG538SY539AD549AD554AE556AE568A Open table in a new tab Production of Human mOGT and mOGT Mutants from an E. coli Protein Expression System—The pET-32 human mOGT expression vector and the pET-32 human mOGT mutant expression vectors were transformed into competent BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). As previously described (45Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the cells were grown overnight at room temperature and 220 rpm in LB medium (KD Medical) supplemented with 50 μg/ml Ampicillin (Sigma). The cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge, and the pellet was resuspended in 1/20 of the original volume of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100, and complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Lysozyme digestion was performed at room temperature for 5 min. The lysate was subjected to freeze/thaw cycles by sonication on ice (3 × 10 s) until DNA was sheared. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min was frozen in aliquots and stored at -80 °C. The total protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay protocol (Pierce). OGT levels were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-His tag antibody (AbCam). O-GlcNAc Transferase Assay—As described previously (45Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), bacterial extracts containing human recombinant mOGT and mOGT mutant proteins were added to a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 nCi of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), and 1 μg of recombinant, purified Nup62. The reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with shaking and were stopped by adding 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) and boiling for 3 min. SDS-PAGE was performed using precast 4–12% NuPage gels (Invitrogen), followed by staining with Simply Blue Safestain (Invitrogen) for 60 min and destaining with distilled water for 60 min. Glycosylation of Nup62 with [14C]-GlcNAc was visualized after treatment with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 60 min by fluorography using BIOMAX-MR film (Kodak) or the Fujifilm BAS-1500 phosphorus imager. Densitometry of x-ray film was performed with Image J software, whereas densitometry of phosphorimaging data was performed with Image Gauge 3.0 software. OGT enzyme activity was also measured using ScintiStrip wells (Wallac) precoated with Nup62 (1Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 46Lubas W.A. Smith M. Starr C.M. Hanover J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For kinetic assays, OGT concentrations were initially determined by Ponceau S staining of Western blots. Image J software was used to determine the level of OGT protein compared with total protein levels determined by BCA. More recent experiments used fast green staining of nitrocellulose, followed by quantitation by infrared imaging using an Odyssey Western blot scanner. Native Gel Electrophoresis—E. coli lysates containing the same amounts of recombinant mOGT and mOGT mutant proteins were prepared in 2× native sample buffer (Invitrogen) and loaded onto a precast 4–12% Tris-glycine Novex gel (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, the gels were immunoblotted with an anti-His tag antibody (AbCam) to detect recombinant protein. Aldolase (160 kDa) and catalase (240 kDa) were used as molecular mass standards (Serva). Site-directed Mutagenesis of CD I Amino Acid Residues—The catalytic region of OGT consists of two highly conserved domains, CD I and CD II. Because the CD I domain of OGT may encode part of the sugar nucleotide-binding domain (36Hanover J.A. Yu S. Lubas W.B. Shin S.H. Ragano-Caracciola M. Kochran J. Love D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), a number of acidic residues in this domain were mutated. Acidic residues in the galactosyltransferase families are known to be important for recognition and stabilization of the sugar nucleotide substrate (44Tenno M. Saeki A. Kezdy F.J. Elhammer A.P. Kurosaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47088-47096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 47Zhang Y. Malinovskii V.A. Fiedler T.J. Brew K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Seven Asp residues and three Glu residues were mutated to Ala. Gly538 was substituted for Ser to evaluate a similar mutation in Arabidopsis OGT that causes disruption to giberellin signaling (Spindly phenotype) (48Jacobsen S.E. Binkowski K.A. Olszewski N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9292-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Three other Gly to Ser substitutions were used to determine whether other Gly residues within CD I would have an effect on the enzyme activity of mOGT. Three Tyr residues, two Phe residues, and a Trp residue were mutated to Ala to evaluate the importance of aromatic residues in CD I. A complete list of CD I mutations is presented in TABLE ONE. Enzyme activity for wild type mOGT and the CD I mutant constructs was determined by the O-GlcNAc transferase assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), and incorporation of [C14]GlcNAc into Nup62 was visualized by fluorography (Fig. 2B). The bands were then quantified, and the resulting values were normalized as percentages of mOGT activity (Fig. 2A). All of the data were normalized to the concentration of OGT in each sample (Fig. 2C). The following mutations were not included for enzymatic analysis, because we could not produce sufficient amounts of protein: Y387A, F439A, D505A, W536A, Y539A, D549A, D554A, and E556A. With the exception of Y434A and D422A, all of the CD I mutants analyzed had a significant inhibitory effect on OGT enzyme activity. D422A produced a 50–100% increase in activity, whereas all of the other acidic amino acid substitutions (D407A, D438A, E482A, and D488A) caused an ∼95–99% reduction in enzyme activity. The Spindly mutation of Arabidopsis is in a conserved region of OGT corresponding to Gly538. Mutation of Gly538 to Ser produced a dramatic reduction in enzyme activity: 1% compared with wild type. This is the first demonstration that the Spindly mutation directly lowers OGT activity and points to the relevance of this residue in the mammalian OGT enzyme. Mutation to Ala of a neighboring residue, Tyr539, decreased OGT activity by 99%. Because glycine is not usually associated with catalytic activity in glycosyltransferases, three other Gly residues were substituted to Ser to determine whether this phenomenon was specific to Gly538 or whether other Gly residues had an effect on enzyme activity. Surprisingly, all three of these Gly residues reduced the enzyme activity by more than 98%. Finally, the remaining mutation, F460A, caused inactivation of the enzyme. All of the above results were confirmed using an alternative, scintillation-based assay. The OGT glycosylation assay was performed in ScintiStrip wells coated with Nup62, and incorporation of [C14]GlcNAc was measured by scintillation counting (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOActivity of mutants compared with wild type mOGT (scintillation assay) The ability of OGT mutants to glycosylate nuclear pore protein Nup62 was compared with wild type mOGT.

Because aromatic residues have been previously implicated in binding reactions of lectins and glycosyltransferases with lectin-like domains (49Beattie B.K. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15134-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), all of the aromatic amino acid residues in CD II were mutated. Three Phe residues and four Trp residues were mutated to Ala. Two Cys residues (Cys836 and Cys839) were also mutated. A complete list of CD II mutations can be found in TABLE ONE. As with CD I mutant constructs, enzyme activity of CD II mutant constructs was determined by the O-GlcNAc transferase assay, and the results were visualized by fluorography of incorporated [C14]GlcNAc into Nup62 (Fig. 3B). The bands were quantified, and the resulting values were normalized as percentages of mOGT activity (Fig. 3A). All of the data were normalized to the concentration of OGT in each sample (Fig. 3C). All of the CD II mutant constructs that contained a Trp to Ala substitution (W735A, W748A, W812A, and W878A) showed a dramatic reduction in enzyme activity. OGT activity of these mutants was reduced by 96–100%. Of the three Phe residues to be mutated, one caused an ∼98% reduction in enzyme activity. The two other Phe residues had much less effect on enzyme activity, with F752A having a similar level of activity as wild type and F776A being reduced to ∼24% of normal activity. N-Ethylmaleimide and Alloxan inhibit OGT presumably by interfering with critical cysteine residues. Furthermore, dithiothreitol (a disulfide bond reducing agent) is known to increase the activity of wild type OGT (45Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the importance of disulfide bonds, and their effect on producing active enzyme. The mechanism underlying this increase in activation is unknown; however, dithiothreitol is known to effect disulfide bonds between adjacent Cys residues or Cys residues that are in close proximity to one another. Two candidate residues for this type of interaction were Cys836 and Cys839. Each of these Cys residues were substituted with a Ser, and their OGT activity was determined. Both mutant enzymes caused a reduction in the level of enzyme activity. The C836S mutant showed variable activity, ranging from an ∼40–90% reduction in activity, whereas C839S showed an ∼93% reduction in activity. These results suggest that both Cys residues may be important for function of the enzyme; however, the difference in the level of OGT activity indicates that these residues may not interact with each other. OGT was placed into the glycogen phosphorylase superfamily (glycogen phosphorylase/glycosyltransferase family (GTGPF)) by Wrabl and Grishin (50Wrabl J.O. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), based on its predicted three-dimensional structure consisting of two Rossman-type fold domains. Enzymes in this family share a common motif; however, the importance of amino acids in the GTGPF motif and the effect that these residues have on catalytic activity have not been studied. Two of the mutations produced are within this motif, L796A and W812A. As mentioned above, all Trp residues reduced OGT activity to background levels. The second mutation of Leu796 to Ala was not predicted to have a large impact on enzyme activity; however, this substitution caused a 99–100% reduction in the level of activity when compared with wild type. These results suggest that at least some of the amino acid residues found within the GTGPF motif are important for enzyme activity. However, examination of this region shows that many of these residues are highly conserved across many of the different OGT species and therefore may be important for maintaining the structure of the enzyme. These residues do not, however, show a great degree of primary sequence homology with glycogen phosphorylase, the enzyme with which the GTGPF superfamily classification was determined. Once again, the above results were confirmed using an alternative, scintillation-based assay (TABLE TWO). Kinetic Analysis of mOGT and Mutant Constructs D422A, Y434A, and F752A—Having shown that three of the mutations made to OGT could transfer a similar or increased amount of sugar nucleotide to Nup62, we next wanted to compare the kinetic properties of each with the native enzyme. Enzyme activity with respect to increasing concentrations of radiolabeled [C14]UDP-GlcNAc was measured by the O-GlcNAc transferase assay, and the results are presented in TABLE THREE. Wild type mOGT exhibited a Km value of ∼0.8 μm and a Vmax value of ∼125 nmol/mg/min (TABLE THREE and Ref. 45Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). OGT mutant D422A appeared to have an overall increase in activity (Fig. 2B), which was found to be due to a lower Km value than wild type (0.29 μm) and an almost 14-fold higher Vmax value (1580 nmol/mg/min). OGT mutant Y434A had approximately double the Km value of wild type (1.9 μm) and a 5-fold increase in the Vmax value (717.4 nmol/mg/min; TABLE THREE). Finally, the F752A OGT mutant had a lower Km value (0.15 μm) and a higher Vmax value (660 nmol/mg/min; TABLE THREE). For comparison, the kinetics of F776A were determined. This mutation was not inactive but showed a ∼76% reduction in enzyme activity. F776A had a Km value of 0.44 μm and a Vmax value of 53 nmol/mg/min (TABLE THREE).TABLE THREEKinetic properties of OGT and active mutants The kinetic parameters of activating mutations D422A, Y434A, and F752A were analyzed and compared with mOGT.

Thus, our analyses reveal a cell type that expresses multiple 3-OST isoforms and produces minimal amounts of aHS-precursor. In part, this mechanism should prevent aHS overproduction by non-3-OST-1 isoforms.

Tremendous functional diversity stems from the structural complexity of the HS component. The HS chains have a repeated disaccharide unit of N-acetylglucosamineβ1 → 4glucuronic/iduronic acidβ1 → 4 (GlcNAc → GlcA/IdoA) that is partially decorated with N- and O-sulfate groups. The specific arrangement of these substituents, in large part, gives rise to distinct binding motifs that activate an array of important biologic effector molecules. HS motifs arise through the remodeling of the copolymer backbone by a relatively ordered series of reactions involving an epimerase and four families of sulfotransferases (reviewed in Refs. 1Rosenberg R.D.

Modification by these isoforms can complete the synthesis of distinct ligand binding motifs, and individual isoforms exhibit distinct sequence specificities. 3-OST-1 preferentially generates a pentasaccharide motif that binds and activates antithrombin (AT) (9Shworak N.W.

HS with this motif is referred to as anticoagulant HS (aHS). 3-OST-3-type isoforms prefer to generate HS-binding sites for the glycoprotein gD of herpes simplex virus-1 (14Liu J. Shworak N.W.

An intermediate specificity occurs for 3-OST-5, which is equally efficient at generating both motifs (11Xia G. Chen J. Tiwari V. Ju W. Li J.P. Malmstrom A. Shukla D. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37912-37919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, the biologic activity of HSPGs can, in part, be regulated by isoform-specific 3-O-sulfation. Glomerular filtration is a process of molecular exclusion whereby the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) functions as an ultrafiltration barrier that prevents high molecular weight proteins from entering the urinary space. The selective permeability of the GBM is imparted by HSPGs, which are secreted by the three major cell types of the glomerulus: glomerular epithelial cells (GECs), mesangial cells, and endothelial cells (17Kanwar Y.S. Jakubowski M.L. Rosenzweig L.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 31: 290-295PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kanwar Y.S. Rosenzweig L.J. Kerjaschki D.I. Ren.

Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In part, permselectivity is thought to involve the extreme negative charge of the HS chains. However, GBM HS also exhibits very unusual 3-O-sulfated residues (21Edge A.S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15874-15881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shen G.Q. Kresbach G.

Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether these residues contribute to permselectivity or other properties of the GBM. In particular, the GBM is exposed to clotting factors and other plasma proteins that pass through the highly permeable glomerular endothelium. Thus, the glomerulus constitutes a physiological functional unit in which the extravascular environment is exposed to clotting factors, but where clotting does not occur. Given that 3-O-sulfated residues are an essential component of anticoagulant HSPGs (aHSPGs), it is conceivable that certain glomerular cell types might synthesize aHSPGs. However, this possibility has not been directly evaluated. It is well established that endothelial cells produce aHSPGs, which bear heparin-like HS chains containing the cognate pentasaccharide motif that binds and activates AT (24Marcum J.A. Fritze L.

Given that aHSPGs can be generated extravascularly, it is conceivable that GECs might also synthesize aHSPGs. The endothelial cell mechanisms that regulate aHSPG production have been well characterized. Endothelial cells produce only a minor subpopulation of aHS chains, containing the AT-binding motif (26Marcum J.A. Atha D.H. Fritze L.M. Nawroth P. Stern D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7507-7517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining HS chains lack this motif and are anticoagulantly inactive (iHS). The core proteins of the active and inactive forms were found to be structurally similar, which suggests that synthesis of aHS is not regulated by the polypeptide chains to which the side chains are covalently linked (32Kojima T. Leone C.W. Marchildon G.A. Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4859-4869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, multiple core proteins bear both aHS and iHS (33Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the core protein syndecan-4 in fibroblastic and endothelial cells increased the amount of iHSPGs but did not increase the amount of aHSPGs, suggesting the presence of a limiting component that is specific to the aHSPG pathway (34Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Biriny L.K. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24941-24952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, the production of aHSPG is controlled by the limiting activity of 3-OST-1, which converts an inactive aHS-precursor into the fully active, mature, aHS (9Shworak N.W. Liu J.

Liu J. Butler L.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27063-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The aHS-precursor is a subpopulation of iHS that contains a discrete oligosaccharide precursor of the AT-binding site (35Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Liu J. Butler L.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27063-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 3-O-Sulfation of the aHS-precursor completes the architecture of the AT-binding motif to generate functional aHS. Because 3-OST-1 activity is limiting, endothelial cell iHS exhibits a large excess pool of unexpended aHS-precursor (35Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Liu J. Butler L.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27063-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that the GBM contains aHSPGs and show for the first time that cultured GECs synthesize aHSPGs. GECs are unusual in that they express multiple 3-OST isoforms and they utilize a novel mechanism of regulating aHSPG production. GECs have excess levels of 3-OST-1 activity, but produce limited aHSPGs because of an extremely small pool of aHS-precursor. Non-3-OST-1 isoforms can generate aHSPGs in vivo, as we show that aHSPGs remain in the GBM of 3-OST-1-deficient mice. Our results suggest that cells that express multiple 3-OST isoforms may employ a novel mechanism to regulate production of aHSPGs. Mesangial Cell Culture—Mesangial cells were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rat kidneys. Procedures for the separation, identification, and culture of the cells were as previously described (36Ruef C. Budde K. Lacy J. Northemann W. Baumann M. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We employed subcultures of the 5th to 12th passages of mesangial cells grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Glomerular Epithelial Cell Culture—Experiments were done with rat primary GECs (rGECs), human primary GECs (hGECs), or with an immortalized murine GEC line (mGECs) derived by us from H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mice (immortomice), purchased from Charles River Co. (United Kingdom) (37Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). rGECs were a gift from Prof. David Salant (Boston University). rGECs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F10 culture media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% Nu serum (BD Biosciences), 0.5 ng/ml insulin (Sigma), 25 ng/ml prostaglandin E (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma). They were incubated in vitrogen-coated Petri culture dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For hGEC cultures, renal tissue was obtained from normal cortex regions of kidneys removed from patients who had unilateral nephrectomy for malignant neoplasms or urologic malformations. The cortex was separated from the medulla, homogenized, and filtered through 80- and 140-mesh sieves. The glomeruli were incubated with collagenase type 1, 300 units/ml at 37 °C. After 30 min, the digestion was filtered through a 500-mesh sieve, GECs were recovered in culture media ((RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and incubated in gelatin-coated culture flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2. hGECs were identified by their typical morphology on light microscopy, positive staining with cytokeratin and vimentin, and negative staining for factor VIII (38Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Lab. Investig. 1985; 53: 122-131PubMed Google Scholar). Subcultures of the 3rd and 4th passages were used. Primary cultures of GECs are difficult to achieve because GECs are terminally differentiated; whereas, culture of GECs under standard conditions leads to de-differentiation. For this reason, we developed an immortalized mGEC line from H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mice (immortomice), purchased from Charles River Co. (37Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). GECs from these mice are able to grow when cultured under permissive conditions, at 33 °C in the presence of interferon-γ. By contrast if they are grown at 37 °C in the absence of interferon-γ, cell division does not occur and they resume a differentiated phenotype. mGECs were identified as mentioned above. Under nonpermissive conditions, these mGECs acquired positive staining with markers found in vivo in fully differentiated podocytes. We found positive staining with anti-Glepp1 and anti-podocalyxin antibodies; whereas, staining was absent in cells grown under permissive conditions. Metabolic Labeling of Cells—Confluent monolayers of cells were incubated in labeling medium containing Na2[35S]SO4 (0.108 Ci/ml) and supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum for mesangial cells or 5% fetal calf serum (or 5% plasma) for GECs. The medium was collected, and the cells were labeled for an additional 24 h with fresh labeling medium. The media was then centrifuged to be free of floating cells, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and kept frozen at -20 °C. The pooled media was referred thereafter as conditioned media. At the end of the 48 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell layer-associated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were released by treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C. The action of trypsin was stopped with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). After centrifugation the supernatant was collected and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and kept frozen at -20 °C. The cell layer-associated fraction was referred thereafter as trypsinate. Purification of 35S-HS—The HS chains of the conditioned media and trypsinate were purified in parallel. Samples were incubated first with 0.1 mg/ml protease (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C and then with 0.16 mg/ml papain (Sigma), and its cofactors (10 mm NaCN, 1 m l-cysteine-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) for 5 h at 37°C. The chondroitin sulfate chains were degraded with chondroitinase ABC (Sigma), 0.1 units/ml, for 3 h at 37 °C and then 0.05 units/ml overnight at 37 °C. 35S-HS chains were isolated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled samples were loaded in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2; the gel was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer followed by 2 column volumes of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5. Then 35S-HS was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline with 1 m NaCl, pH 7.2. The 35S-HS was cleaved from peptides by β-elimination, and proteins were removed by phenol extraction. 35S-HS was dialyzed against 10 mm NH4HCO3 and evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac concentrator (35Shworak N.W.

The purity of the preparation was confirmed by the absence of degradation with chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) and complete digestion with flavobacterium heparitinase (Seikagaku, Japan) (31Hosseini G. Liu J. de Agostini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22090-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Isolation of aHS by Affinity Chromatography—aHS was isolated from anticoagulant iHS by AT affinity on concanavalin A-Sepharose. To form aHS·AT complexes, 35S-HS was incubated with 2.5 μm AT in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm dextran sulfate, 0.002% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. aHS·AT complexes were bound to concanavalin A by mixing samples with a suspension of concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) equilibrated in the same buffer and incubating for 4 h by gentle agitation at room temperature. iHS was removed by washing the matrix. aHS was eluted from the gel by dissociation of the aHS·AT complexes in buffer containing 1 m NaCl. AT was removed by phenol extraction and NaCl by dialysis. The HS fractions were concentrated by ethanol precipitation. aHS and iHS content were quantified by scintillation counting. Affinity Coelectrophoresis—At neutral pH the electrophoretic mobility of HS is higher than that of AT and the binding of AT to HS retards its migration (39Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed on a 1% agarose gel (Sea-Plaque-agarose, Bioconcept) in 0.005% CHAPS (Sigma), 50 mm MOPSO (Sigma), 1 mm EDTA (Sigma), and 125 mm Na-acetate (Merck), pH 7, at 4 °C. Three different 35S-HS preparations were loaded in separate transverse slots close to the cathode, each slot facing three rectangular sagittal wells in which AT was cast. AT concentrations were 0, 30, and 500 nm, respectively. The 35S-aHS and 35S-iHS purified from conditioned medium or trypsinate (30,000 cpm for each sample) were electrophoresed through the AT-containing wells at 60 V and 200 mA for 5 h. Electrophoresis end points were determined by the migration of bromphenol blue, which migrates just after HS. The gel was air-dried and autoradiographed for 48 h. Molecular Size Determination—The hydrodynamic size distribution of 35S-HS was analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was run in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and loaded with 100,000 cpm of 35S-HS. GAGs were quantified by scintillation counting. The V0 marker was dextran blue 2000 (Mr of 2,000,000) and the Vt marker was 35S-SO4. Alternatively the Mr was determined by electrophoresis of 35S-HS on polyacrylamide gradient (7.5-15%) gels, without SDS, in 0.25 m Tris buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl to limit the GAG hydration volume. Calibrated GAG molecular weight standards were heparin (Mr = 16,400), chondroitin sulfate (Mr = 21,600), and heparan sulfate (Mr = 15,500). 1 μg of unlabeled GAGs or 50,000 cpm of 35S-HS chains were loaded per lane. Migration profiles of 35S-HS were recorded with a phosphorimager analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Migration profiles of standards were determined after staining the gel with azure A and AgNO3. Modal RF of GAGs and 35S-HS were measured by densitometry scanning of the stained gel or phosphorimager analysis of 35S counts. 35S-HS Mr was determined by extrapolation from the regression curve of the standard GAGs RF and the log of molecular weights (31Hosseini G.

Biochem. 1990; 185: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Disaccharide Analysis—GEC aHS and iHS were degraded to disaccharides by deacetylation through hydrazinolysis followed by high pH nitrous acid and then low pH nitrous acid treatments as described previously. The distribution of sulfated species was analyzed by reverse ion pairing HPLC on a C18 column (0.46 × 24 cm, Vydac); 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. Similar to the procedure of Guo and Conrad (41Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the samples were eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 1 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate, pH 3.6, containing acetonitrile at 4.8 (45 min), 9 (15 min), and 11.7%. The identification of each disaccharide was confirmed by co-chromatography on ion pairing reverse phase HPLC with 3H-labeled disaccharide standards, as described in prior publications (34Shworak N.W.

Measurement of aHS-Precursor Pool Size—The aHS-precursor pool size was measured by the ability of 3-OST-1 or 3-OST-3A to convert iHS into aHS in vitro. Metabolically labeled 35S-HS purified from cultured hGECs was incubated with purified recombinantly expressed 3-OST-1 or 3-OST-3A in the presence of the sulfate donor PAPS, as described (9Shworak N.W.

As control, we also evaluated iHS purified from the L-cell clone, L-33+ (43Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). aHSPG Localization by Autoradiographic and Fluorescence Microscopy—aHSPGs were localized by 125I-AT binding on kidney cryosections followed by microscopic autoradiography, as described (44Princivalle M. Hasan S. Hosseini G. de Agostini A.I. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Kidneys were obtained from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and 5-μm cryosections were cut from OCT-embedded tissues. Kidney serial cryosections were preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 20 μl of 125I-AT (15,000 cpm/μl), coverslipped, and kept in humidified chambers for 1 h at 4°C. Slides were washed five times and fixed in absolute ethanol, immersed in autoradiographic emulsion, and revealed in Dektol. The specificity of 125I-AT binding to kidney cells was verified by using heparin (100 μg/ml) as a competitor. Alternatively, cryosections were incubated with either 100 milliunits/ml chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) or 20 milliunits/ml heparitinase (Seikagaku, Japan) for 1 h at 37°C prior to incubation with 125I-AT. Similar analyses were conducted on kidney sections from 3-OST-1-deficient mice (Hs3st1-/-), which we have previously described (45HajMohammadi S. Enjoyji K. Princivalle M. Christi P. Lech M. Beeler D. Rayburn H. Schwartz J.J. Barzagar S. de Agostini A.I. Post M.J. Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. J. Clin.

The generation of fluorescent AT forms is more fully described elsewhere. 3W. Kett, S. HajMohammadi, A. Lanahan, and N. W. Shworak, manuscript in preparation.

https://openalex.org/W2073551429,"We previously showed that the Drosophila DNA binding homeodomain of Prospero included a 28 amino-acid sequence (HDA) that functions as a nuclear export signal. We describe here the identification of a protein we named Caliban, which can directly interact with the HDA. Caliban is homologous to human Sdccag1, which has been implicated in colon and lung cancer. Here we show that Caliban and Sdccag1 are mediators of nuclear export in fly and human cells, as interference RNA abrogates export of EYFP-HDA in normal fly and human lung cells. Caliban functions as a bipartite mediator nuclear export as the carboxy terminus binds HDA and the amino terminus itself functions as an NES, which directly binds the NES receptor Exportin. Finally, while non-cancerous lung cells have functional Sdccag1, five human lung carcinoma cell lines do not, even though Exportin still functions in these cells. Expression of fly Caliban in these human lung cancer cells restores EYFP-HDA nuclear export, reduces a cell's ability to form colonies on soft agar and reduces cell invasiveness. We suggest that Sdccag1 inactivation contributes to the transformed state of human lung cancer cells and that Caliban should be considered a candidate for use in lung cancer gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1992392251,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate downstream signaling through cognate growth factor receptor-induced dimerization and autophosphorylation. Overexpression of RTKs can lead to constitutive activation due to increased dimerization in the absence of ligand, and downstream signals are presumed to be the same as the ligand-induced signals. We have shown that the murine Ron (mRon) receptor tyrosine kinase exhibits constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway that is independent of the two docking site tyrosines, whereas activation of this pathway in response to ligand (macrophage-stimulating protein) is abolished in the absence of these tyrosines. Furthermore, we identified three tyrosines (Tyr-1175, Tyr-1265, and Tyr-1294) within the kinase domain that play critical but overlapping roles in controlling constitutive Erk activation by mRon. Phenylalanine mutations at these three tyrosines results in a receptor that fails to constitutively activate the Erk pathway but retains the ability to induce Erk phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation. The ability of mRon to activate the MAP kinase pathway is dependent on c-Src activity, and we have shown that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with mRon. c-Src fails to interact with mRon when the three tyrosines required for MAP kinase activation are mutated, whereas the presence of any one of these tyrosines alone restores Erk phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Src. Thus, the ligand-dependent and -independent activity of mRon can be uncoupled through the alteration of selective sets of tyrosines. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate downstream signaling through cognate growth factor receptor-induced dimerization and autophosphorylation. Overexpression of RTKs can lead to constitutive activation due to increased dimerization in the absence of ligand, and downstream signals are presumed to be the same as the ligand-induced signals. We have shown that the murine Ron (mRon) receptor tyrosine kinase exhibits constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway that is independent of the two docking site tyrosines, whereas activation of this pathway in response to ligand (macrophage-stimulating protein) is abolished in the absence of these tyrosines. Furthermore, we identified three tyrosines (Tyr-1175, Tyr-1265, and Tyr-1294) within the kinase domain that play critical but overlapping roles in controlling constitutive Erk activation by mRon. Phenylalanine mutations at these three tyrosines results in a receptor that fails to constitutively activate the Erk pathway but retains the ability to induce Erk phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation. The ability of mRon to activate the MAP kinase pathway is dependent on c-Src activity, and we have shown that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with mRon. c-Src fails to interact with mRon when the three tyrosines required for MAP kinase activation are mutated, whereas the presence of any one of these tyrosines alone restores Erk phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Src. Thus, the ligand-dependent and -independent activity of mRon can be uncoupled through the alteration of selective sets of tyrosines.

Deregulation of RTKs is involved in various pathogenic conditions, including tumorigenesis (1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). RTK overexpression has been detected in several types of tumors in which high concentrations of the receptor on the cell surface allows homo-oligomerization of the receptor to occur in the absence of ligand. Alternatively, RTKs can be constitutively activated upon fusion with a dimerization domain (2Cross N. Reiter A. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), or mutations in the extracellular or juxtamembrane domain, all of which can confer constitutive kinase activation by promoting receptor oligomerization (3Arevalo J.

In principle, these events and ligand stimulation activate RTKs through a common mechanism, receptor dimerization and concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to the enhancement of kinase activity and creation of a common assembly platform for downstream signaling partners. Alternatively, activating mutations in the kinase domain of RTKs, have been demonstrated to alter substrate specificity of the receptor, leading to induction of a distinct subset of signals culminating in transformation (7Piao X.

Overexpression of the Met/Ron family of RTKs has been implicated in the progression of a variety of tumors, mostly of epithelial origin. Met was originally isolated as a fusion partner with Tpr, resulting in transformation of a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line (8Park M. Dean M. Cooper C. Schmidt M. O'Brien D. Vande Woude G. Cell. 1986; 45: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and this fusion was demonstrated to result in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the Met receptor (9Gonzatti-Haces M. Seth A. Park M. Copeland T. Oroszlan S. Vande Woude G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, germ line point mutations in the kinase domain of Met resulting in constitutive activation of the receptor are primarily responsible for hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (10Jeffers M. Schmidt L. Nakaigawa N. Webb C. Weirich G. Kishida T. Zbar B. Vande Woude G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1145-1150Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced forms in the extracellular domain of the related Ron receptor, resulting in constitutive activation of the receptor, have been isolated from patients with colon cancer (11Zhou Y. He C. Chen Y. Wang D. Wang M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and through knockout studies, murine Ron has been implicated in the progression of skin and lung epithelial malignancies (12Peace B. Toney-Earley K. Collins M. Waltz S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Chan E. Peace B. Collins M. Waltz S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, murine and chicken Ron (also called STK and SEA, respectively), have been adapted by viruses to drive the progression of erythroleukemia (14Persons D. Paulson R. Loyd M. Herley M. Bodner S. Bernstein A. Correll P. Ney P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the case of murine Ron, a naturally occurring truncated form of the receptor interacts in situ with the viral glycoprotein, gp55, resulting in stabilization and constitutive activation of the receptor (15Nishigaki K. Thompson D. Hanson C. Yugawa T. Ruscetti S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7893-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alternatively, c-SEA is the cellular proto-oncogene of the avian erythroblastosis virus, S13, which causes erythroleukemia and sarcomas in chickens (16Smith D. Vogt P. Hayman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although signaling through this family of receptors is highly conserved, it remains to be determined whether activation of the Met/Ron receptor through various mechanisms results in the induction of the same signaling events. The potential diversity of RTK-mediated signaling is underscored by the ability of these receptors to phosphorylate a large repertoire of docking sites for downstream signaling proteins, various combinations of which could be exploited by the receptor to produce diverse biological outcomes. However, the Met/Ron family of RTKs generates signals sufficient to induce complicated biological outcomes through two phosphorylation sites on the carboxyl tail (17Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), supported by the observation that knock-in animals bearing mutations at these two sites have the same lethal phenotype as the complete null model (18Maina F. Casagranda F. Audero E. Simeone A. Comoglio P. Kelin R. Ponzetto C. Cell. 1996; 87: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that the Met C-terminal tail mediates recruitment of the multifunctional scaffolding protein, Gab1 (19Niemann C. Brinkmann V. Spitzer E. Hartmann G. Sachs M. Naundorf H. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), through a unique Met binding domain in Gab1. Gab1 contains a number of potential phosphorylation sites, coupling Met to downstream signaling pathways through interaction with various adaptor proteins, including Grb2, p85, Shp2, and CRKL, to mediate biological responses (20Schaeper U. Gehring N. Fuchsm K. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 21Sakkab D. Lewitzky M. Posem G. Schaeper U. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. Feller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10772-10778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). RTKs can also recruit the Gab family of scaffolding proteins through the unique C-terminal SH3 domain of the Grb2 adaptor protein (22Lewitzky M. Kardinal C. Gehring N. Schmidt E. Konkol B. Eulitz M. Birchmeier W. Schaeper U. Feller S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the recruitment of Gab2 to murine Ron (STK) and chicken SEA is required for transformation by these receptors (23Ischenko I. Petrenko O. Gu H. Hayman M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6311-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 3H. E. Teal, J. Xu, S. Ni, L. D. Finkelstein, A. C. Cheng, R. F. Paulson, G. S. Ferg, and P. H. Correll, submitted for publication. 3H. E. Teal, J. Xu, S. Ni, L. D. Finkelstein, A. C. Cheng, R. F. Paulson, G. S. Ferg, and P. H. Correll, submitted for publication. Binding of Grb2 to the docking site tyrosines of the Met/Ron family of RTKs plays a critical role in the induction of cellular transformation by these receptors (24Park C. Hayman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Finkelstein L. Ney P. Liu Q. Paulson R. Correll P.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1800-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Grb2-mediated activation of MAP kinase is a highly conserved mitogenic pathway in which the small GDP/GTP exchange factor, SOS, which is constitutively associated with the N-terminal Grb2 SH3 domain, is recruited to the vicinity of the cell membrane through interaction with the phosphorylated receptor. This results in the activation of its membrane target, the small GTPase, Ras, leading to the classic cascade initiated by Raf. Alternatively, recruitment of Gab1 to the Met receptor results in sustained activation of the MAP kinase pathway through recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2 (27Rosario M. Birchmeier W. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 328-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which Shp2 leads to MAP kinase activation is currently unclear, dephosphorylation of RasGAP binding sites in the receptor, as well as the dephosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine of Src family kinases, have been proposed (28Neel B. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the murine Ron receptor induces Erk-mediated signals through a mechanism distinct from the activation of this pathway following ligand stimulation. We show that, although ligand-induced Erk activation requires the two docking site tyrosines of mRon, ligand-independent activation of this same pathway does not require the docking site tyrosines or the C-terminal tail, but rather is dependent upon three tyrosines that reside in the kinase domain of mRon, and is associated with co-immunoprecipitation of the receptor with c-Src. These data indicate that the ligand-dependent and -independent signals emanating from mRon are initiated by distinct subsets of tyrosines in the receptor, and have broad implications for the study of RTK signaling. Cell Culture, Antibodies, and Reagents—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies against phospho-Erk, Erk, and HA epitope (262K) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies against Erk and phospho-tyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and antibodies for c-Fos, Grb2 (c-23), and c-Src (N-16) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-specific antibodies to the activation loop of Ron were kindly provided by Dr. Jiong Wu (Cell signaling). Anti-serum against mRon was raised against the last 15 amino acids of the carboxyl tail. Recombinant macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) was from R&D Systems. Gene Construction and Mutagenesis—A luciferase reporter plasmid containing an AP1 consensus binding site, wild-type c-Src cDNA, and the rat phospholipase Cγ lipase-dead mutant (H327F) were kindly provided by Dr. Avery August (The Pennsylvania State University). The c-Src dominant negative mutant (K296R/Y528F) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and subcloned into the HindIII site of pCDNA3.1. Mouse Ron is expressed in the PCI-neo mammalian expression vector or the MSCV retroviral vector. Point mutagenesis and C-terminal truncation were performed by PCR with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

For the mRon C-terminal HA tag, full-length or truncated mRon cDNA was amplified with a 5′ primer containing a HindIII site and a 3′ primer containing a NotI site using pfuI high fidelity polymerase (Stratagene). These blunt fragments were terminally phosphorylated then cloned into the EcoRV site of pCDNA3.1. HindIII and NotI were used to excise the fragments that were then ligated into pCDNA3.1 containing the tandem HA sequence digested with HindIII and NotI. All point mutants and tagged constructs were sequenced to confirm the absence of additional mutations arising from PCR elongation. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assays—For the luciferase assay, 5 × 104 HEK 293 cells/well were seeded into 24-well plates. The next day, a mixture of 0.2 μg of wild-type or mutant forms of mRon and 2 ng of AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid was used for transient transfection with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For experiments using wild-type or dominant negative c-Src, combinations of 0.15 μg of c-Src or control vector, 50 ng of mRon or its derivatives, and 0.5 ng of AP-1 were used for transfection. Cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml MSP immediately after the DNA complex was added to the culture medium. 24–48 h later, luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). For the immunoprecipitation assays, 4 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates. The next day cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of c-Src or its mutant as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—40 h following transfection, cells in 6-well plates were suspended in 600 μl of cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and 300 μl of supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, then 20 μl of protein A or protein G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) plus beads were added to the resultant immunocomplex for another 2–4 h. Beads were rigorously washed at 4 °C with a 1:1 solution of cell lysis buffer and 1 m lithium chloride three times. Beads were resuspended in 10 μl of SDS sample buffer, and denatured proteins were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and probed with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed with TBST three times and incubated with goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse or rabbit IgG (Sigma). Blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce or Amersham Biosciences). For re-probing, membranes were stripped with Tris-HCl 62.5 mm, ph6.8, SDS 2%, and β-mercaptoethanol 0.7% at 50 °C for 30 min. Retrovirus Preparation and in Vitro Infection of Primary Bone Marrow Cells—Total bone marrow cells from mRon–/– mice were harvested and infected with viral supernatant from 293 cells transiently co-transfected with MSCV-based retroviral vectors expressing the indicated receptors under the transcriptional regulation of the viral long terminal repeat, along with pECO and VSVG envelope protein-encoding constructs in the presence of 2.5 ng/ml interleukin-3, as previously described (25Finkelstein L. Ney P. Liu Q. Paulson R. Correll P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3562-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were then plated in the Methocult M3234 (Stem Cell Technologies) containing interleukin-3 (2.5 ng/ml, Peptrotech) in triplicate. Cultures were incubated for 2–8 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Epo-independent erythroid colonies (BFU-E) were visualized by acid-benzidine staining as previously described at day 8. Murine Ron Induces Activation of the MAP Kinase Signaling Pathway in a Kinase-dependent, Ligand-independent Manner—Constitutive activity of RTKs has frequently been observed in a variety of tumors as well as in overexpression systems that are often utilized to study receptor signaling. To study signaling through the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase, we expressed murine Ron in 293 cells and examined the ability of the receptor to activate downstream signaling events. We found that transfection of 293 cells with mRon resulted in a robust activation of the MAP kinase pathway as determined by phosphorylation of Erk, up-regulation of c-Fos expression, and induction of AP1 activity and that this constitutive activity absolutely required the kinase activity of the receptor as determined by transfecting the cells with the kinase-dead mutant, mRonK1091M (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, we failed to detect a similar up-regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway under these conditions as measured by Akt activity in an in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). We also observed similar activation of AP-1 in murine NIH3T3 cells transfected with mRon (data not shown). These data indicate that expression of mRon in the absence of ligand results in the selective up-regulation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. To determine whether this constitutive activity is maintained at lower levels of receptor expression, we generated a C-terminally HA-tagged mRon and titrated out the amount of plasmid transfected into the 293 cells. Ron expression levels as detected by anti-HA were compared with the ability of the receptor to phosphorylate Erk and up-regulate the expression of c-Fos. We found that, even at levels of receptor expression barely detectable by Western blot analysis, Erk phosphorylation and c-Fos expression were induced (Fig. 1C). To determine whether mRon was constitutively phosphorylated in these cells, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-HA and blotted with ant-pTyr. We found that, even at the lowest levels of receptor expression, mRon was constitutively phosphorylated (Fig. 1D). The Docking Site Tyrosines (Tyr-1330/1337) of Murine Ron Are Required for MSP-dependent MAP Kinase Activation but Dispensable for Ligand-independent Activation of This Pathway—A signature motif of the Met/Ron family of RTKs is the presence of two conserved docking site tyrosines separated by six residues on the carboxyl tail. To determine the effect of these tyrosines on the activation of the MAP kinase pathway by mRon, we mutated Tyr-1330 and Tyr-1337 individually and in combination and co-transfected the mutant receptors and an AP1 luciferase reporter into HEK293 cells. We found that the ligand-independent phosphorylation of Erk and up-regulation of c-Fos is unaffected by mutation of the docking site tyrosines, both singly and in combination (Fig. 1A). This activity is reflected in the ability of the mutant receptors to up-regulate AP1 induced transcription as measured by luciferase activity (Fig. 1B). A recent study demonstrated that the Ron carboxyl tail also provides phosphorylated serines as docking sites for 14-3-3 proteins, and this pathway is implicated in Ron-integrin cross-talk during epidermal wound healing (29Santoro M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also mutated the two putative 14-3-3 binding sites, Ser-1366 and Ser-1372 to alanine, and results from expression of these mutants in 293 cells indicated that these serines are not responsible for the ligand-independent activation of the MAP kinase pathway by mRon (data not shown). In addition, we generated a series of C-terminal deletion constructs in which 16, 36, 42, 49, and 60 amino acids were progressively deleted. All of these mutants retained the ability to activate the MAP kinase pathway in the absence of ligand except for the final deletion, which extends into the kinase domain (data not shown). The same experiment was performed with mRon and the combined docking site mutant mRonY1330F/Y1337F in the presence or absence of MSP. While MSP stimulation resulted in enhanced Erk phosphorylation and c-Fos expression from the wild-type receptor, mRonY1330F/Y1337F failed to respond to MSP by further up-regulating this pathway (Fig. 2A). The inability of the docking site mutant to stimulate Erk phosphorylation in response to MSP was reflected in the absence of further up-regulation of AP1 activity under these conditions (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data indicate that an intact kinase domain, but not the docking site tyrosines or other motifs in the C-terminal tail, is required for the constitutive activation of MAP kinase by mRon. However, the docking site tyrosines are essential for the activation of this pathway by mRon in response to ligand stimulation. Identification of Tyrosines within the Kinase Domain Critical for the Constitutive Activation of the MAP Kinase Pathway by mRon—Our data thus far have shown that the ability of mRon to activate the MAP kinase pathway in a ligand-independent manner is independent of the carboxyl tail, but requires the integrity of the kinase domain. There are ten tyrosines in the kinase domain of mRon in addition to the two docking site tyrosines in the C-terminal tail. Although specificity of SH2 domain recruitment is largely dictated by the composition of the three to five residues on the carboxyl– terminus of the phospho-tyrosine, hydrophobicity at the pY+3 positions seems to be ubiquitously essential for module recognition. Tyr-1265 and Tyr-1294 in the C lobe of the kinase domain, as well as the docking site tyrosines, match the minimum requirement for SH2 binding. (Indicated by boxes in Fig. 3A.) However, we found that mutation of all four of these tyrosines (referred to as mRon Y4F) has no significant effect on the phosphorylation of Erk by mRon (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). Therefore, we addressed the role of the other tyrosines by individually mutating them to phenylalanine in the context of mRon Y4F. As expected, mutation of the activation loop tyrosines (Y1215F/Y1216F) completely abrogated receptor-mediated Erk activation by inactivating catalytic activity, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with mRon antiserum followed by immunoblot with anti-pTyr (data not shown). Of the remaining six tyrosines, mutation of Tyr-1078 and Tyr-1140 in the context of mRon 4F resulted in mild reduction of receptor-mediated Erk phosphorylation, whereas mutation of Tyr-1175 severely impaired activation of this pathway (Fig. 3B). However, only mutation of Tyr-1175 in the context of mRon4YF, but not Tyr-1078 or Tyr-1440, was determined to be a critical residue for the activation of the AP1 transcriptional response (Fig. 3C). Tyr-1175 lies in the conserved αE region of the C lobe, raising the possibility that mutation of this tyrosine abolishes receptor-mediated Erk activation by inhibiting catalytic activity. Therefore, we compared the autophosphorylation of HA-tagged mRon4F alone or in the presence of T1078F, T1140F, or T1175F by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and Western blot analysis with anti-pTyr. Although mutation of Tyr-1175 in the context of mRon4F resulted in reduced receptor phosphorylation, phosphorylation of mRon was not abrogated (Fig. 3D). In addition, mutation of T1175F in the context of the wild-type receptor did not inhibit the ability of the receptor to induce Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Therefore, regulation of kinase activity is not likely to be the sole mechanism by which Tyr-1175 regulates receptor-mediated MAP kinase signaling. The Ligand-dependent and -independent Activities of the mRon Receptor Can Be Uncoupled Both Biochemically and Functionally—We have shown thus far that mRonY4F plus Tyr-1175F (Now called Y5F) fails to induce constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Here we set out to determine the role, if any, of the docking site tyrosines in the context of this mutant. Therefore, we added back Tyr-1330/1337 in the context of Y5F, resulting in a receptor containing the three kinase mutations Y1265F/Y1294F/Y1175F. Transfection of 293 cells demonstrated that this mutant still lacked the ability to induce ligand-independent phosphorylation of Erk and up-regulation of c-Fos expression. However, upon ligand stimulation, this receptor was fully capable of inducing activation of this pathway (Fig. 4A). In addition, MSP stimulation of these cells resulted in increased phosphorylation of the receptor as determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and blotting with anti-pTyr or phospho-specific antibody to the tyrosines in the activation loop (Fig. 4B). Thus, we are able to distinguish the tyrosines responsible for ligand-dependent activation of MAP kinase (Tyr-1330/1337) from the tyrosines involved in the constitutive induction of this pathway by mRon (Tyr-1265/1294/1275). To determine if this uncoupling translates to a functional response by the receptor, we generated retroviruses expressing the wild-type and mutant receptors, and used these to infect primary erythroid progenitor cells. We and others have shown previously that activation of Ron signaling results in Epo-independent growth of these cells (25Finkelstein L. Ney P. Liu Q. Paulson R. Correll P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3562-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30van den Akker E. van Dijk T. Parren-van Amelsvoort M. Grossman K. Schaeper U. Toney-Earley K. Waltz W. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2004; 103: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The infected bone marrow cells were plated in methylcellulose in the absence of Epo with or without MSP, and the number of burst-forming unit erythroids (BFU-Es) were counted on day 8 following staining with acid benzidine to detect hemoglobin. The results from these studies support our observations in 293"
https://openalex.org/W2022035117,"The rhodopsin/transducin-coupled vertebrate vision system has served as a paradigm for G protein-coupled signaling. We have taken advantage of this system to identify new types of constitutively active, transducin-α (αT) subunits. Here we have described a novel dominant-negative mutation, made in the background of a chimera consisting of αT and the α subunit of Gi1 (designated αT*), which involves the substitution of a conserved arginine residue in the conformationally sensitive Switch 3 region. Changing Arg-238 to either lysine or alanine had little or no effect on the ability of αT* to undergo rhodopsin-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange, whereas substituting glutamic acid for arginine at this position yielded an αT* subunit (αT*(R238E)) that was incapable of undergoing rhodopsin-dependent nucleotide exchange and was unable to bind or stimulate the target/effector enzyme (cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase). Moreover, unlike the GDP-bound forms of αT*, αT*(R238A) and αT*(R238K), the αT*(R238E) mutant did not respond to aluminum fluoride (AlF4-), as read out by changes in Trp-207 fluorescence. However, surprisingly, we found that αT*(R238E) effectively blocked rhodopsin-catalyzed GDP-GTP exchange on αT*, as well as rhodopsin-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity. Analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography indicated that the αT*(R238E) mutant exists in a nucleotide-free state. Nucleotide-free forms of Gα subunits were typically very sensitive to proteolytic degradation, but αT*(R238E) exhibited a resistance to trypsin-proteolysis similar to that observed with activated forms of αT*. Overall, these findings indicated that by mutating a single residue in Switch 3, it is possible to generate a unique type of dominant-negative Gα subunit that can effectively block signaling by G protein-coupled receptors. The rhodopsin/transducin-coupled vertebrate vision system has served as a paradigm for G protein-coupled signaling. We have taken advantage of this system to identify new types of constitutively active, transducin-α (αT) subunits. Here we have described a novel dominant-negative mutation, made in the background of a chimera consisting of αT and the α subunit of Gi1 (designated αT*), which involves the substitution of a conserved arginine residue in the conformationally sensitive Switch 3 region. Changing Arg-238 to either lysine or alanine had little or no effect on the ability of αT* to undergo rhodopsin-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange, whereas substituting glutamic acid for arginine at this position yielded an αT* subunit (αT*(R238E)) that was incapable of undergoing rhodopsin-dependent nucleotide exchange and was unable to bind or stimulate the target/effector enzyme (cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase). Moreover, unlike the GDP-bound forms of αT*, αT*(R238A) and αT*(R238K), the αT*(R238E) mutant did not respond to aluminum fluoride (AlF4-), as read out by changes in Trp-207 fluorescence. However, surprisingly, we found that αT*(R238E) effectively blocked rhodopsin-catalyzed GDP-GTP exchange on αT*, as well as rhodopsin-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity. Analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography indicated that the αT*(R238E) mutant exists in a nucleotide-free state. Nucleotide-free forms of Gα subunits were typically very sensitive to proteolytic degradation, but αT*(R238E) exhibited a resistance to trypsin-proteolysis similar to that observed with activated forms of αT*. Overall, these findings indicated that by mutating a single residue in Switch 3, it is possible to generate a unique type of dominant-negative Gα subunit that can effectively block signaling by G protein-coupled receptors. The vertebrate phototransduction system operating in retinal rods has served as a prototype for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorsαTα subunit of transducinPDEphosphodiesterase;γPDE, PDEγ subunitHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factor. -dependent signal transduction (1Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The photoreceptor, rhodopsin, a seven-membrane-spanning GPCR, is the initial component in this pathway and is capable of responding to a single photon of light. Light-activated rhodopsin engages the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein), transducin, and catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on its α subunit (αT). The activated, GTP-bound αT subunit dissociates from its β and γ subunit partners (Gβγ), as well as from rhodopsin, thereby enabling it to interact with the regulatory γ subunits (γPDE) of the target/effector, the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), and stimulate the hydrolysis of cyclic GMP. The reduction in the levels of cyclic GMP results in the closure of cation-specific cyclic GMP-gated ion channels in rod outer segments, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and the generation of a signal that is sent to the optic nerve. Significant amplification of the signal occurs at the level of G protein activation, so that several hundred αT subunits can be activated upon the absorption of a single photon by a rhodopsin molecule. The signaling system then shuts off upon the hydrolysis of GTP by αT, with this deactivation step being accelerated through the actions of regulator of G protein signaling proteins (2Berman D.M.

G protein-coupled receptors α subunit of transducin phosphodiesterase;γPDE, PDEγ subunit high pressure liquid chromatography guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Given the central role that G proteins play as molecular switches in GPCR-coupled signal transduction, it is of fundamental importance to understand how they are activated by their upstream receptors to undergo GDP-GTP exchange. This is an especially intriguing question, given the indications that the binding site for GPCRs on their Gα subunit targets is a significant distance from the guanine nucleotide-binding domain (5Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 6Cherfils J. Chabre M. Trends Biochem.

It is generally agreed that the rate-limiting step for G protein activation is the dissociation of GDP from the Gα subunit. The retinal G protein transducin exhibits an especially slow rate of intrinsic GDP dissociation and basal GDP-GTP exchange (8Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3937-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and therefore is dependent on light-activated rhodopsin to catalyze these events. Unlike their small G protein counterparts, the α subunits of the large G protein family contain a helical domain in addition to their guanine nucleotide-binding (Ras-like) domain (9Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suspected that the role of GPCRs (e.g. rhodopsin) in stimulating GDP-GTP exchange involves changing the juxtaposition of the helical domain relative to the Ras-like domain, as well as perturbing the interactions that normally hold GDP tightly in place (via residues that stabilize the guanine ring and phosphate moieties). Recently, we have tested the importance of altering the relative positions of the helical and Ras-like domains (15Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40137-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Substitutions were made for the conserved residues that comprise the linker regions connecting these two major domains. Indeed, we found that mutations in the linker regions of αT yielded molecules capable of constitutive GDP-GTP exchange in the absence of rhodopsin. We have tried to identify mutations that yield constitutively active Gα subunits that fully mimic the functional outcome of GPCR-mediated interactions, just as we have done for the small G protein Cdc42 (16Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Tu S.S. Wu W.J. Yang W. Nolbant P. Hahn K. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12350-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we have examined several different regions on αT, with one of these being the conformationally sensitive Switch 3 domain. The Switch 3 domain has been shown to play a critical role in G protein activation by linking the binding of target/effectors at Switch 2 to the stimulation of effector activity (18Iiri T. Bell S.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21673-21676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and to be important for regulator of G protein signaling-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (20Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Switch 3 might also help to ensure that αT reaches the appropriate activated conformation to engage downstream target/effectors and, in doing so, perhaps to influence nucleotide binding and the nucleotide exchange reaction. To examine such possibilities, we have changed conserved residues in Switch 3 in the background of an αT/αi1 chimera (αT*, see “Experimental Procedures”) and determined the consequences of these substitutions on αT* activation and αT*-target/effector interactions. Here we have reported the surprising finding that specific substitutions for one of these residues, Arg-238, can influence the ability of αT* to reach the activated (GTP-bound) state and to ultimately dissociate from the receptor (rhodopsin). Although certain changes at position 238 showed no apparent effect on the ability of αT* to functionally couple to rhodopsin, we found that when glutamic acid was substituted for the conserved arginine residue, an αT* subunit was generated that was capable of blocking the functional coupling between rhodopsin and transducin. The αT*(R238E) mutant was isolated in a nucleotide-free state but exhibited a reduced sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis, when compared with GDP-bound αT*. Thus, we believe that the R238E substitution yields a Gα mutant that remains stable in the absence of bound nucleotides and therefore can serve as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the interactions of a GPCR with its G protein substrate. Materials—GTP, GDP, GTPγS, cGMP, tetrabutylammonium bromide, trypsin, and other reagents (HEPES, MgCl2, dodecyl maltoside, NaF, AlCl3) were purchased from Sigma. BA85 nitrocellulose filters were from Schleicher & Schuell. [35S]GTPγS was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Frozen, dark-adapted bovine retinas were obtained from W. L. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). Mutagenesis—Degenerate primers from Invitrogen were used to generate different mutants of αT*(Arg-238). A plasmid containing the αT* gene, which codes for an αT-αi1 chimera in which the corresponding region from αi1 was inserted between residues 215 and 294 of αT, was prepared as described previously (15Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40137-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This served as a template to perform site-directed mutagenesis by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The parental DNA template was digested using DpnI endonuclease, and the nicked vector DNA with the desired mutation was transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue competent cells. DNA was purified from single colonies using the Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit and sequenced at the BioResource Center of Cornell University. Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant αT* and the αT*(Arg-238) mutants were expressed and prepared using procedures similar to those described by Skiba et al. (21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, the αT* subunits were expressed in BL21(DE3) competent cells and purified in the presence of 50 μm GDP. The proteins were eluted from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column with 200 mm imidazole and then eluted from a Q column with a NaCl gradient. The αT* subunits were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex G75 HR 26/60 column equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol (Buffer G). The samples were aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. The final yield of αT*, αT*(R238A), and αT*(R238K) ranged from 1 to 1.5 mg of pure protein/liter of bacterial culture. Some aggregation was noticed during the purification of the αT*(R238E) mutant, and the final yield of this mutant ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 mg of pure protein/liter of culture. However, gel filtration chromatography of purified αT* and αT*(R238E) yielded similar profiles with roughly 50% of the recombinant αT* subunits eluting at the expected size of ∼40 kDa and ∼50% of the total protein eluting at the size of ∼80 kDa due to dimerization. Purification of Retinal Proteins—Rod outer segment membranes were isolated using a sucrose gradient as described in Papermaster and Dreyer (22Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Holotransducin and PDE6 were purified from rod outer segment membranes using previously described procedures (23Phillips W.J. Trukawinski S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16679-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PDE was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex G200 HR26/60 column equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol. Urea-washed rod outer segment membranes, prepared as described (24Min K.C. Gravina S.A. Sakmar T.P. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), provided the rhodopsin used in all experiments. The αT and Gβγ subunit components of holotransducin were separated on a Blue-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol. The Gβγ complex was eluted from the Blue-Sepharose column with 250 ml of low salt buffer (i.e. the equilibration buffer containing 100 mm KCl) and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex G75 HR 26/60 column equilibrated with buffer G. The final yield of Gβγ ranged from 3 to 5 mg of pure protein/300 retina. The purified subunit complex was aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. HPLC Analysis—A Sunfire C-18 reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) filled with 5 μm silica was obtained from Waters. The system consisted of a Waters 1525 binary HPLC pump machine and a Waters 2487 dual absorbance UV detector. Chromatography was performed in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6.5) containing 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 7.5% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 0.2 mm NaN3 (HPLC buffer) at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. In this system, the order of elution of guanine nucleotides is GMP, GDP, and GTP (retention times 4.8, 8, and 14 min, respectively). The amount and identity of the guanine nucleotide bound to αT* was determined by adding ∼400 μg of protein sample to HPLC buffer and then centrifuging for 10 min at 12,000 × g to remove denatured protein. The supernatant was added directly to the column, and guanine nucleotides were chromatographed using the same buffer. The column was calibrated with solutions of the different guanine nucleotides. Trypsin Proteolysis Assay—The patterns of tryptic proteolysis were determined as described previously (25Neer E.J. Denker B.M. Thomas T.C. Schmidt C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-μl reactions containing 5 μg of either αT* or αT*(R238E) were performed for 10 min at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm MgSO4 and 100 μm GDP. Where indicated, 20 mm NaF and 600 μm AlCl3 were added to the buffer to form the aluminum fluoride (AlF4-) complex and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Trypsin digestions were performed by adding 2 μl of trypsin (100 μg of trypsin/ml) and incubating for 10 min at 25 °C. The reactions were stopped with the addition of SDS sample buffer and heat treatment (95 °C, 5 min). Proteolytic fragments were resolved on 15% SDS-gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were made on a Varian Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer in 1 ml of HMN buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) at 25 °C. αT*-GDP (400 nm) was preincubated in HMN buffer for 5 min at 25 °C. The AlF4- complex was formed by adding 10 mm NaF and 50 μm AlCl3. The binding of AlF4- was measured by monitoring the enhancement of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of αT* upon excitation at 300 nm and emission at 345 nm (15Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40137-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 35[S]GTPγS Binding Assays—Rhodopsin (4 nm), αT*-GDP (500 nm), and Gβγ (500 nm) were incubated in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside) for 20 min at room temperature, in the presence of light. Binding reactions were started by the addition of 100 μl of 10 μm [35S]GTPγS (1 Ci/mmol). Aliquots (20 μl) were removed at the times indicated and applied directly to prewetted nitrocellulose filters (pore size = 0.45 μm) on a suction manifold. The filters were washed twice with HMN buffer and counted in a scintillation counter (LS6500 Multipurpose Scintillation counter) after the addition of 3 ml of scintillation liquid (Scintisafe 30% cocktail). The kapp values for the binding reactions were obtained by fitting the data to the equation Y = Bmax(1 - exp(-kt)) using GraphPad Prism software. Measurement of cGMP PDE Activity—A pH microelectrode was used to measure the change in pH (in millivolts) that results from the release of one proton for each molecule of cGMP hydrolyzed (26Liebman P.A. Evanczuk A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, purified αT*-GDP (1 μm) was preincubated with 500 nm Gβγ, 20 nm rhodopsin, and 100 μm GTPγS in HMN buffer for 20 min at 25 °C, in the presence of light. PDE (100 nm) was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min at 25 °C. The substrate, cGMP (5 mm), was added to the reaction mix, and the relative cGMP hydrolysis rate was calculated based on the change in pH over time. Additional Procedures—Protein concentrations were measured as described by Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) in 12 or 15% acrylamide gels. GraphPad Prizm (version 4) software was used to fit experimental data. The Conformationally Sensitive Switch 3 Region of αT Influences Rhodopsin-stimulated Activation of Transducin—Comparisons of the x-ray crystal structures for the GDP-bound (signaling-inactive) and GTPγS-bound (signaling-competent) forms of αT (12Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) indicated that there were three regions that undergo conformational changes in response to GDP-GTP exchange. Two of these regions correspond to the conformationally sensitive segments initially identified in Ras (29Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and Ef-Tu (30Jurnak F. Science. 1985; 230: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), designated as Switch 1 and Switch 2. The third region, designated as Switch 3, undergoes changes in αT and other Gα subunits but not in Ras nor in related small G proteins. Switch 3 was previously shown to play a key role in linking the binding of Switch 2 to target/effector proteins, with the stimulation of effector activity (19Li Q. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21673-21676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, removal of the entire Switch 3 loop, as well as mutation of the conserved Glu-232 in this segment of αT, yields an αT subunit that is capable of binding to the PDE in a GTP-dependent manner but is unable to stimulate PDE activity (cyclic GMP hydrolysis). These findings raised the possibility that Switch 3 may be communicating with another region of the αT subunit that was directly responsible for effector regulation. Fig. 1a shows the x-ray crystal structure for the GDP-bound form of retinal αT (10Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), with the Switch 3 segment highlighted in magenta. Arginine 238 is a conserved residue within Switch 3. In GDP-bound αT, Arg-238 contacts Glu-39 (Fig. 1b), which is in the phosphate-binding P-loop lying just upstream from the beginning of the large helical domain, whereas in the activated (GTPγS-bound) αT subunit, Arg-238 contacts both Glu-39 and Gln-143 of the helical domain. It has been suggested that the helical domain of Gα subunits plays a role in mediating the regulation of target/effectors, and in the particular case of αT, may be essential for the stimulation of PDE activity (31Liu W. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12878-12883Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Liu W. Clark W.A. Sharma P. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34284-34292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Erickson J.W. Mittal R. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8693-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to see whether disruption of the apparent links between the conserved Arg-238 in Switch 3 and Glu-39 and/or Gln-143 might compromise αT activation and/or its ability to bind and regulate the PDE. To facilitate the expression of different αT mutants in E. coli, point mutations were prepared in the background of an αT/αi1 chimera referred to as αT* (see “Experimental Procedures”). Unlike wild-type αT, the αT* subunit is expressed in a soluble form in E. coli and (like retinal αT) is fully capable of functionally coupling to rhodopsin (15Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40137-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 2 show that changing the arginine at position 238 to either alanine or lysine, within the αT* background, had only modest effects on the ability of αT* to respond to rhodopsin and Gβγ and to undergo GDP-[35S]GTPγS exchange. The same appears to be true when Arg-238 is changed to glutamine (20Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, when Arg-238 was changed to glutamic acid, the resulting αT* mutant was completely ineffective in undergoing rhodopsin-stimulated activation. The αT*(R238E) Mutant Is Unable to Activate the Cyclic GMP PDE—We also examined the abilities of different position 238 mutations within an αT* background to stimulate PDE activity. Both the αT*(R238A) and the αT*(R238K) mutants, upon binding to GTPγSina rhodopsin-dependent manner, were compromised in their ability to stimulate PDE activity (Fig. 3a). Their partial ability to stimulate the target/effector may reflect the importance in maintaining the linkage between Arg-238 and Glu-143 of the helical domain for proper effector regulation. However, the αT*(R238E) mutant was completely incapable of stimulating PDE activity, consistent with its inability to become activated in response to rhodopsin. Still, we wondered whether the αT*(R238E) mutant might be able to bind to PDE and prevent wild-type αT* from binding and stimulating the target/effector. However, as shown in Fig. 3b, this was not the case, as there was no detectable inhibition of the αT*-mediated stimulation of PDE activity when excess αT*(Arg-238) was preincubated with PDE prior to the addition of activated (GTPγS-bound) αT* to the assay. The αT*(R238E) Mutant Is Unresponsive to Aluminum Fluoride Treatment—We also examined whether substitutions for the conserved Arg 238 in Switch 3 had any effect on the ability of αT* to respond to aluminum fluoride (AlF4-) and undergo activating conformational changes (34Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Substituting either alanine or lysine for arginine at position 238 had no effect on the ability of αT* to respond to AlF4- when monitoring Trp-207 fluorescence (Fig. 4). However, the αT*(R238E) mutant was unresponsive to AlF4-, showing no detectable change in its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The αT*(R238E) Mutant Is Nucleotide-depleted—The inability αT*(R238E) to of respond to AlF4-, together with the fact that AlF4- only binds to the GDP-bound form of Gα subunits, prompted us to examine the nucleotide-bound state of R238E mutant by HPLC. Fig. 5, a and b, show the HPLC profiles obtained following treatment with acetonitrile to release any prebound GDP or GTP from αT* and αT*(R238E), respectively. Fig. 5c shows the control elution profiles for GDP and GTP. It was clear that although αT* was purified in the GDP-bound state, thus accounting for its ability to respond to AlF4-, αT*(R238E) was isolated in a nucleotide-free state. This explained the inability of the R238E mutant to bind AlF4. However, although it has been generally assumed that nucleotide-depleted Gα subunits are highly susceptible to proteolysis and degradation, somewhat surprisingly, the αT*(R238E) mutant did not show an enhanced sensitivity to trypsin, and in fact, showed a greater degree of resistance than did the GDP-bound form of retinal αT or the recombinant αT* protein. For example, it has been well established that when the GDP-bound form of retinal αT is treated with trypsin, a sequence of proteolytic events occurs that culminates in the cleavage of arginine 204 in Switch 2, yielding fragments of ∼23 and ∼10 kDa (36Fung B.K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2907-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). When activated forms of αT (either bound to AlF4- or bound to GTPγS) are exposed to trypsin, the proteolytic site in Switch 2 is protected, as an outcome of the activating conformational change, thus resulting in the production of a stable fragment of ∼34 kDa. The same was true when the recombinant αT* subunit was treated with trypsin. Fig. 6 shows that the 23-kDa fragment was generated when proteolysis of αT* was performed in the absence of AlF4-, whereas complete proteolysis was blocked when αT* was treated with the activating agent, yielding first an ∼38-kDa fragment and then the 34-kDa fragment. When the same experiments were performed with the αT*(R238E) mutant, there was a slight shift in the mobility of the two core fragments of αT*(R238E), perhaps because of the point mutation; however, there was little or no generation of a fragment in the range of 20-23 kDa. These results suggested that the conformation of the Switch 2 domain of αT*(Arg-238) at least partially mimics that of the activated state, thus protecting the trypsin-sensitive Arg-204 residue and enabling this nucleotide-free mutant to exhibit increased resistance to proteolytic degradation.FIGURE 6Trypsin protection of αT* and the αT*(R238E) mutant protein. A total of 5 μg of αT* or αT*(R238E) was treated with 2 μl of trypsin (100 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 10 min in the presence of GDP (100 μm) alone (indicated as + Trypsin) or GDP (100 μm) and AlCl3 (600 μm) plus NaF (20 mm) (indicated as + AlF4-, + trypsin). Untreated αT* served as a control (-AlF4-, -trypsin). SDS-PAGE buffer was added to stop the reactions, and the mixtures were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The arrows on the left show the positions of the molecular mass standards. The ∼34-kDa fragment (αT*-GDP-AlF4) and the ∼23-kDa fragment (αT*-GDP) are also indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W1984064713,"The yeast nucleoporin Nup116p plays an important role in mRNA export and protein transport. We have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal 147 residues of this protein, the region responsible for targeting the protein to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The structure of Nup116p-C consists of a large β-sheet sandwiched against a smaller one, flanked on both sides by α-helical stretches, similar to the structure of its human homolog, NUP98. In unliganded form, Nup116p-C exhibits evidence of exchange among multiple conformations, raising the intriguing possibility that it may adopt distinct conformations when bound to different partners in the NPC. We have additionally shown that a peptide from the N terminus of the nucleoporin Nup145p-C binds Nup116p-C. This previously unknown interaction may explain the unusual asymmetric localization pattern of Nup116p in the NPC. Strikingly, the exchange phenomenon observed in the unbound state is greatly reduced in the corresponding spectra of peptide-bound Nup116p-C, suggesting that the binding interaction stabilizes the domain conformation. This study offers a high resolution view of a yeast nucleoporin structural domain and may provide insights into NPC architecture and function."
https://openalex.org/W2077917645,"The transcription factor cAMP-response element modulator (CREM) protein, plays a major role in cAMP-responsive gene regulation. Biological consequences resulting from the transcriptional stimuli of CREM are dictated by the expression of multiple protein isoforms generated by extensive alternative splicing of its precursor mRNA. We have previously shown that alternative splicing enables the expression of the CREM gene to be “switched” within the human myometrium during pregnancy from the production of CREMτ2α, a potent transcriptional activator to the synthesis of CREMα, a transcriptional repressor. Furthermore we have recently reported that this change in the expression of CREM spliced variants is likely to have important ramifications on the regulation of downstream cAMP-response element-responsive target genes involved in uterine activity during gestation. We have investigated the splicing factors involved in controlling the expression of myometrial CREM splice variants. Data presented here from transient transfections indicate that the switch in the synthesis of CREMτ2α to CREMα that occurs during pregnancy is regulated primarily by an SR protein family member, SRp40. We also show that expression of this splicing factor is tightly regulated in the myometrium during pregnancy. SRp40 regulates the splicing of CREM via its interactions with multiple ESE motifs present in the alternatively exons of CREM. In vitro splicing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were employed to confirm the functionality of the SRp40-binding ESEs, thus providing a mechanistic explanation of how SRp40 regulates the switch in splicing from production of CREMτ2α to CREMα.

CREM is a member of the basic region-leucine zipper family of transcription factors, which also includes the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein and the activating transcription factor proteins, as well as Jun and Fos (6Landschulz W.H.

Genes containing CRE motifs within their promoters are involved in a wide range of cellular and molecular processes, including cell signaling, immune regulation, gene transcription, and cell cycle/survival (2Sassone-Corsi P.

Each CREM protein isoform possesses trans-activation and/or trans-repression properties, depending on the exon content of their mRNAs (see Fig. 1A). For example, CREM proteins derived from mRNAs containing one or more of the exons encoding the trans-activation domains generally serve as transcriptional activators, whereas CREM isoforms derived from mRNAs with the DNA-binding domain intact but the exons encoding the transactivation domains spliced out predictably serve as transcriptional repressors (2Sassone-Corsi P.

CREM repressors lack the functional domains that mediate transcriptional activation but can still have the capacity to bind to CREs as a homodimer/heterodimer, suppressing transcriptional activation by displacing functionally active dimers from the CRE (2Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, CREM protein isoforms are not only generated from alternative splicing but also from the use of alternative promoters, transcription and translation initiation sites, together with changes in stability due to variant poly(A) sites (5Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Sanborn B.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3921-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).One major mechanism of CREM/CRE-mediated transcriptional activation is the binding of hormone ligands to G-protein-coupled receptors (15Servillo G. Della Fazia M.A. Sassone-Corsi P. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in the intracellular level of cAMP due to activation of adenylyl cyclase, which in turn promotes the phosphorylation of CREM via protein kinase A. Various components of the cAMP signaling pathway are often up- or down-regulated to potentiate cAMP levels, notably hormonal ligands that bind to the G-protein-coupled receptors (16Zuo J. Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the receptors themselves (17Dong Y.L. Fang L. Kondapaka S. Gangula P.R. Wimalawansa J.

Increased expression of Gαs is known to increase constitutive as well as stimulated cAMP accumulation and enhance distal events such as transcription factor phosphorylation and cAMP-responsive gene expression (22Yang X. Lee F.Y. Sr. & Wand G.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).There is extensive evidence for the physiological relevance of CREM-mediated gene regulation. CREM appears to be particularly important in the brain, where it has been implicated in the regulation of long term memory and the circadian clock (2Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); in the testes, where it orchestrates spermatogenesis (23Don J. Stelzer G. Mol. Cell.

We have previously reported differential expression of specific CREM protein isoforms within the myometrium tissue throughout pregnancy, namely CREMτ2α and CREMα (Fig. 1B), and demonstrated their ability to bind CRE-containing oligonucleotides and activate and/or repress reporter gene transcription (27Bailey J. Phillips R.J. Pollard A.J. Gilmore K. Robson S.C. Europe-Finner G.N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1717-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, through microarray studies, we have recently shown that these potent factors act in myometrial cells to affect the expression of a plethora of genes with defined roles associated with uterine activity during pregnancy (28Bailey J. Tyson-Capper A.J. Gilmore K. Robson S.C. Europe-Finner G.N. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 34: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms within myometrial cells appear to switch the production of the alternatively spliced CREMτ2α activator that decreases sequentially through the nonpregnant, pregnant nonlaboring, and laboring phases to the synthesis of CREMα repressor protein that proceeds from zero expression in the nonpregnant uterus to a high level of expression in the pregnant and laboring myometrium (Fig. 1B). Thus, alternative splicing is responsible for altering the biological consequences, resulting from the transcriptional stimuli of either CREMτ2α or CREMα within the human myometrium during fetal maturation.Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a tightly regulated RNA processing event mediated by a complex interplay of specific cis-elements and trans-acting factors (29Cáceres J.F.

Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The cis-elements include the 5′ and 3′ splice sites at exon/intron boundaries and the branch site and polypyrimidine tract preceding the 3′ splice site (30Graveley B.R.

Additional regulatory cis-elements include exon splicing enhancers (ESEs) or exon splicing silencers (ESSs) that have been identified in precursor mRNA sequences from various tissue-specific or developmentally regulated genes (32Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 33Elrick L.L. Humphrey M.B. Cooper T.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell.

ESEs serve as splicing enhancers by contributing to the accuracy and efficiency of alternative splicing when recognized and bound by specific trans-acting factors (34Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Numerous trans-acting basal or regulatory splicing factors compete and interact with the various cis-elements and indeed with each other, including the ubiquitously expressed U small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, the serine-arginine (SR) family of nuclear phosphoproteins, and the heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) among many others (29Cáceres J.F.

We have previously reported that the splicing factors SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 are both spatially and temporally regulated within the human myometrium during pregnancy (Fig. 2A) and that these factors are involved in regulating alternative splicing of the GTP-binding protein Gαs (42Pollard A.J.

This finding further supports the premise that concentration ratios of trans-splicing factors in vivo may therefore be critical in defining the expression of specific protein isoforms in different tissues. Consequently, in this study, we employed CREM minigene splicing constructs, which incorporate the regulatory cis-elements associated with the alternative splicing of CREM in vivo, and employed transient transfections and in vitro splicing together with RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to investigate the trans- and cis-acting factors and elements involved in regulating the switch in the expression of myometrial CREMτ2α to CREMα that occurs throughout pregnancy.FIGURE 2Temporal and spatial expression of myometrial SF2/ASF and hnRNPA1 during human gestation and controls for transient transfection and production of SRp40 protein.

These primers, detailed in TABLE ONE, amplify CREM exons E and F (which encodes the phosphorylation domains), exon G (encoding the second glutamine-rich trans-activation domain), and the downstream exon H, together with truncated versions of their adjacent intronic sequences. PCR products were initially cloned into the TOPOR-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm exon/intron DNA sequences. Each CREM fragment was then subcloned sequentially into pcDNA3.1 by repeated restriction digestion and ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Promega) to generate the complete pcDNA3.1CREM-1 splicing construct that is under transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and contains the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. A second CREM minigene construct, pcDNA3.1CREM-2, which consists of exons C (encoding the first glutamine-rich trans-activation domain) and exons E/F/G/H (and their flanking intronic regions) was also generated in order to reproduce the regulated splicing of the CREM gene in myometrium and ensure that the regulatory factors that splice CREM precursor mRNA into CREMτ2α are present in this model system. Plasmids encoding splicing factors SF2/ASF (pCG-SF2), SRp20 (pCG-20), SRp40 (pCG-40), SRp55 (pCG-55), 9G8 (pCG-9G8), and hnRNPA1 (pCG-A1) have been described (37Hanamura A. Cáceres J.F. Mayeda A.

Samples of upper and lower segment myometrial tissue were obtained from nonpregnant, pregnant nonlaboring, and spontaneous laboring women undergoing surgery. Written consent was obtained from all women, and ethical approval was granted by the Newcastle and North Tyneside Health Authority Ethics Committee. Primary myocyte isolation was undertaken essentially as described in Ref. 44Phaneuf S. Europe-Finner G.N. Varney N. MacKenzie I.Z. Watson S.P. López Bernal A. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 136: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar. Primary myocytes were cultured with complete minimal essential medium-d-valine medium (Cell Culture Technologies), which inhibits fibroblast growth, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1 unit/ml), and streptomyocin (1 ng/ml) and cultured under standard conditions at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Transient Transfection of Cultured Myometrial Cells—Transfection experiments on primary myometrial cells (obtained from pregnant tissue samples) were undertaken on subculture passages 2–3. Myometrial and HeLa cells (used as a control) were co-transfected, at 60–70% confluence (in the absence of antibiotics) using Mirus LT-1 (Cambridge Bioscience) cationic lipid transfection reagent with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1CREM-1 or pcDNA3.1CREM-2 and 1.5 μg of pCG-SF2, pCG-A1, pCG-SC35, pCG-SRp20, pCG-SRp40, pCG-SRp55, pCG-9G8, or a pCG control vector. Transfection efficiencies were in the range of 25–30% for all experiments, as determined by transfection with a β-galactosidase encoding plasmid, pcDNA3.1 LacZ (Invitrogen) (data not shown). Cells were harvested either 48 h (HeLa cells) or 72 h (myometrial cells) after transfection. Confirmation that the CREM minigene plasmids contain the necessary cis-acting regulatory signals for efficient pre-mRNA splicing was obtained by run-off transcription using a mMESSAGE-mMACHINE capping/transcription kit (described below) and RT-PCR of the CREM spliced products from total RNA extracted from myometrial cells post-transfection.Western Blot Immunodetection—Myometrial tissue homogenates were prepared as previously described (42Pollard A.J. Sparey C. Robson S.C. Krainer A.R. Europe-Finner G.N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 1928-1936PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was assayed using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and SDS-PAGE was performed using 200 μg of total protein from each homogenate resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and data obtained where a linear relationship existed between the amount of protein loaded and the intensity of the ECL signal from the immunoblots. Transfection efficiencies were also confirmed in individual experiments by Western immunoblotting using specific monoclonal antibodies to SF2/ASF (anti-SF2; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), hnRNPA1 (4B10; Abcam), and a polyclonal antibody to SRp40 (anti-SRs Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Note the increased protein expression of SF2/ASF, hnRNPA1, SC35, and SRp40 on transfection with their respective plasmids (Fig. 2B), and endogenous levels of these proteins in myometrial cells were also calculated by this procedure (data not shown).Expression of SRp40 Protein—To generate human SRp40 protein, the full-length cDNA coding sequence of the pCG-SRp40 plasmid (described above) was amplified by PCR using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). SRp40-specific sense and antisense primers were used that also contain XbaI and BclI restriction sites, respectively, to facilitate the subcloning into a pcDNA3.1 expression vector that has an upstream T7 RNA promoter. SRp40 protein was produced using a transcription/transcription (TnT) procedure using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). 2 μl of the TnT reaction was resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and production of SRp40 protein was verified by observation of an intense 40-kDa band after Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2C, lane 1). Production of SRp40 protein was also confirmed after Western immunoblotting using the polyclonal antibody to SRp40 (anti-SRs Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as shown in Fig. 2C, lane 2.CREM mRNA Splicing Analysis by RT-PCR—CREM mRNA spliced variants generated from the minigenes in transfected cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from individual transfection experiments using SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega) or Tri-Reagent (Sigma), and first strand cDNA synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using 20 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 100 ng of oligo(dT)16 as primer. PCR amplification was carried out using 2 μl of cDNA template with CREM-specific primers (detailed in TABLE TWO). PCR analysis was performed with 25 cycles as detailed in the legend to Fig. 3. PCR products were sequenced to confirm their identity.TABLE TWORT-PCR primers for the amplification of CREM spliced variants Primer name Target site DNA sequence (5′-3′) pcDNA31 sense CTCACTATAGGGAGACCCAAGC Sense E1 Exon E TGCAGAGACAGATGAATCTGCAG Sense E2/V Exon E CTAGACTCGAGGTAGCAGCAATTGC Sense F Exon F GAATGAACTGTCCTCTGATGTGC Antisense F Exon F GGTACTGCCATGGTAGCAATAC Antisense H/V Exon H GGTTTAAACCTGTTTTTCATTAGCCTC Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Effect of SR proteins and hnRNPA1 on CREM isoform expression. RT-PCR was employed using RNA from transient co-transfection of myometrial cells (A and B) and HeLa cells (C) using pcDNA3.1-CREM-1 and pcDNA3.1-CREM-2 together with plasmids encoding SF2/AF, hnRNPA1, SC35, SRp40, SRp20, SRp55, 9G8, or the pCG control vector. PCRs were performed with an initial hot start cycle at 94 °C (4 min), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min) followed by 20–25 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min). PCRs were carried out using sense primers for the pcDNA 3.1 vector together with antisense primers for exon H plus 9 nucleotides of vector to identify CREM spliced variants expressed from the pcDNA3.1 vector (i). Splicing patterns were consequently confirmed by using the vector sense primers with antisense primers of the exon F of CREM (ii) and sense primers for exon F with antisense primers for exon H (iii). Note that overexpression of SRp40 results in the inclusion of exon G (as indicated by an asterisk). glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase controls (GAPDH) for each cell type are shown below.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ESE Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Oligonucleotides containing the individual CREM exon splicing enhancer motifs were designed to be used in RNA EMSAs. Sequences containing the ESE motifs were placed downstream from a T7 RNA promoter to facilitate transcription. Sequences for the oligonucleotides are shown in TABLE THREE. GpppG-capped and [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA ESE oligonucleotides were synthesized by run-off transcription for 4 h at 37 °C using the T7 capped transcription kit as described above. 3 μl of radiolabeled RNA was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with either 3 μl of SRp-40 protein, 5 units of SF2/ASF,"
https://openalex.org/W2029007480,"M1 RNA, the catalytic subunit of <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNase P, is an essential ribozyme that processes the 5′ leader sequence of precursor tRNAs. It is generated by the removal of 36 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the primary <i>rnpB</i> transcript (pM1 RNA), but the biological significance of this reaction in bacterial metabolism remains obscure. In this study, we constructed and analyzed bacterial strains carrying mutations in the <i>rne</i>-dependent site of their <i>rnpB</i> genes, showing that the 3′ processing of M1 RNA is essential for cell viability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pM1 RNA can undergo not only 3′ processing but also poly(A)-dependent degradation. Therefore, our results suggest that the 3′ processing of M1 RNA provides a functional mechanism for the protection of its primary transcript against degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2001094364,"p53 is the most frequently inactivated gene in human cancers, reflecting its pivotal role in maintaining genomic integrity. The present study was conducted to explore the possibility that tumour cells with no intrinsic defects of the p53 pathway might nevertheless acquire p53 dysfunction through extrinsic suppression of the pathway by microenvironmental factors. Neoplastic cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were cultured in the presence or absence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) to induce p53 accumulation. bFGF is greatly increased in the plasma of CLL patients and can suppress p53 activation in some experimental models. IR induced a marked increase in p53 levels in 28 samples from 24 patients. bFGF inhibited IR-induced p53 accumulation to some extent in most of these samples and by more than 50% in seven samples from seven patients. Suppression of p53 activation by bFGF was frequently but not always accompanied by upregulation of the p53-inhibitory protein MDM2 and/or phosphorylation of MDM2 at serine 166, and was associated with impaired transcriptional activation of the p53 target gene p21. These observations provide the first demonstration in human cancer cells that the p53 pathway can be suppressed by factors in the tumour-cell microenvironment."
