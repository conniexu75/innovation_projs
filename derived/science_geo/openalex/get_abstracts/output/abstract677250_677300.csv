https://openalex.org/W3180777186,"COVID-19 represents high morbidity and mortality, its complications and lethality have increased due to bacterial superinfections. We aimed to determine the prevalence of bacterial superinfection in adults with COVID-19, hospitalized in two clinics in Medellín-Colombia during 2020, and its distribution according to sociodemographic and clinical conditions. A cross sectional study was made with 399 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR. We determined the prevalence of bacterial superinfection and its factors associated with crude and adjusted prevalence ratios by a generalized linear model. The prevalence of superinfection was 49.6%, with 16 agents identified, the most frequent were Klebsiella ( pneumoniae and oxytoca ) and Staphylococcus aureus . In the multivariate adjustment, the variables with the strongest association with bacterial superinfection were lung disease, encephalopathy, mechanical ventilation, hospital stay, and steroid treatment. A high prevalence of bacterial superinfections, a high number of agents, and multiple associated factors were found. Among these stood out comorbidities, complications, days of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and steroid treatment. These results are vital to identifying priority clinical groups, improving the care of simultaneous infections with COVID-19 in people with the risk factors exposed in the population studied, and identifying bacteria of public health interest."
https://openalex.org/W3181661743,"To systematically define molecular features in human tumor cells that determine their degree of sensitivity to human allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells, we quantified the NK cell responsiveness of hundreds of molecularly annotated ‘DNA-barcoded’ solid tumor cell lines in multiplexed format and applied genome-scale CRISPR-based gene-editing screens in several solid tumor cell lines, to functionally interrogate which genes in tumor cells regulate the response to NK cells. In these orthogonal studies, NK cell–sensitive tumor cells tend to exhibit ‘mesenchymal-like’ transcriptional programs; high transcriptional signature for chromatin remodeling complexes; high levels of B7-H6 (NCR3LG1); and low levels of HLA-E/antigen presentation genes. Importantly, transcriptional signatures of NK cell–sensitive tumor cells correlate with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance in clinical samples. This study provides a comprehensive map of mechanisms regulating tumor cell responses to NK cells, with implications for future biomarker-driven applications of NK cell immunotherapies. The use of natural killer (NK) cells in immunotherapy as an alternative to allogeneic T cells is gaining ground. Here, two genome-scale high-throughput platforms are used to identify genes that modulate the sensitivity of multiple solid tumor cell lines to NK-mediated killing."
https://openalex.org/W3178244438,"Members of the mammalian AlkB family are known to mediate nucleic acid demethylation1,2. ALKBH7, a mammalian AlkB homologue, localizes in mitochondria and affects metabolism3, but its function and mechanism of action are unknown. Here we report an approach to site-specifically detect N1-methyladenosine (m1A), N3-methylcytidine (m3C), N1-methylguanosine (m1G) and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G) modifications simultaneously within all cellular RNAs, and discovered that human ALKBH7 demethylates m22G and m1A within mitochondrial Ile and Leu1 pre-tRNA regions, respectively, in nascent polycistronic mitochondrial RNA4-6. We further show that ALKBH7 regulates the processing and structural dynamics of polycistronic mitochondrial RNAs. Depletion of ALKBH7 leads to increased polycistronic mitochondrial RNA processing, reduced steady-state mitochondria-encoded tRNA levels and protein translation, and notably decreased mitochondrial activity. Thus, we identify ALKBH7 as an RNA demethylase that controls nascent mitochondrial RNA processing and mitochondrial activity."
https://openalex.org/W3180363056,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are normally quiescent, but have evolved mechanisms to respond to stress. Here, we evaluate haematopoietic regeneration induced by chemotherapy. We detect robust chromatin reorganization followed by increased transcription of transposable elements (TEs) during early recovery. TE transcripts bind to and activate the innate immune receptor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) that generates an inflammatory response that is necessary for HSCs to exit quiescence. HSCs that lack MDA5 exhibit an impaired inflammatory response after chemotherapy and retain their quiescence, with consequent better long-term repopulation capacity. We show that the overexpression of ERV and LINE superfamily TE copies in wild-type HSCs, but not in Mda5-/- HSCs, results in their cycling. By contrast, after knockdown of LINE1 family copies, HSCs retain their quiescence. Our results show that TE transcripts act as ligands that activate MDA5 during haematopoietic regeneration, thereby enabling HSCs to mount an inflammatory response necessary for their exit from quiescence."
https://openalex.org/W3178032001,"Dynamin has an important role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by cutting the neck of nascent vesicles from the cell membrane. Here, using gold nanorods as cargos to image dynamin action during live clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we show that, near the peak of dynamin accumulation, the cargo-containing vesicles always exhibit abrupt, right-handed rotations that finish in a short time (~0.28 s). The large and quick twist, herein named the super twist, is the result of the coordinated dynamin helix action upon GTP hydrolysis. After the super twist, the rotational freedom of the vesicle increases substantially, accompanied by simultaneous or delayed translational movement, indicating that it detaches from the cell membrane. These observations suggest that dynamin-mediated scission involves a large torque generated by the coordinated actions of multiple dynamins in the helix, which is the main driving force for vesicle scission."

https://openalex.org/W3179442887,"Despite a growing understanding of the molecular and developmental basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), how the neuronal encoding of social information is disrupted in ASD and whether it contributes to abnormal social behavior remains unclear. Here, we disrupted and then restored expression of the ASD-associated gene Shank3 in adult male mice while tracking the encoding dynamics of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) over weeks. We find that Shank3 disruption led to a reduction of neurons encoding the experience of other mice and an increase in neurons encoding the animal's own experience. This shift was associated with a loss of ability by neurons to distinguish other from self and, therefore, the inability to encode social agency. Restoration of Shank3 expression in the mPFC reversed this encoding imbalance and increased sociability over 5-8 weeks. These findings reveal a neuronal-encoding process that is necessary for social behavior and that may be disrupted in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W3181871091,"COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly required a high demand of hospitalization and an increased number of intensive care units (ICUs) admission. Therefore, it became mandatory to develop prognostic models to evaluate critical COVID-19 patients.We retrospectively evaluate a cohort of consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients admitted to ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. A multivariable Cox regression model including demographic, clinical and laboratory findings was developed to assess the predictive value of these variables. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrap resampling technique. The model's discriminatory ability was assessed with Harrell's C-statistic and the goodness-of-fit was evaluated with calibration plot.242 patients were included [median age, 64 years (56-71 IQR), 196 (81%) males]. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (46.7%), followed by diabetes (15.3%) and heart disease (14.5%). Eighty-five patients (35.1%) died within 28 days after ICU admission and the median time from ICU admission to death was 11 days (IQR 6-18). In multivariable model after internal validation, age, obesity, procaltitonin, SOFA score and PaO2/FiO2 resulted as independent predictors of 28-day mortality. The C-statistic of the model showed a very good discriminatory capacity (0.82).We present the results of a multivariable prediction model for mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. After adjustment for other factors, age, obesity, procalcitonin, SOFA and PaO2/FiO2 were independently associated with 28-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The calibration plot revealed good agreements between the observed and expected probability of death."
https://openalex.org/W3178642320,"Spain was, together with Italy, the first European country severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. After one month of strict lockdown and eight weeks of partial restrictions, Spanish residents are expected to have revised some of their beliefs. We conducted a survey one year before the pandemic, at its outbreak and during de-escalation (N = 1706). Despite the lockdown, most respondents tolerated being controlled by authorities, and acknowledged the importance of group necessities over individual rights. However, de-escalation resulted in a belief change towards the intrusiveness of authorities and the preeminence of individual rights. Besides, transcendental beliefs–God answering prayers and the existence of an afterlife–declined after the outbreak, but were strengthened in the de-escalation. Results were strongly influenced by political ideology: the proportion of left-sided voters who saw authorities as intrusive greatly decreased, and transcendental beliefs prevailed among right-sided voters. Our results point to a polarization of beliefs based on political ideology as a consequence of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3179956282,"Background This study aimed to clarify how SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is related to COVID-19 critical condition development and mortality in comparison with other predictive markers and scoring systems. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at Yokohama Municipal Citizen’s Hospital and National Institute of Infectious Diseases. We recruited adult patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 2020 and January 2021. We compared RNAemia with clinical status on admission including scoring systems such as the 4C Mortality, CURB-65, and A-DROP, as well as the C t value of the nasopharyngeal PCR, in predicting COVID-19 mortality and critical condition development. Results Of the 92 recruited patients (median age, 58; interquartile range, 45–71 years), 14 (14.9%) had RNAemia. These patients had an older age (median, 68 years vs. 55.5 years; p = 0.011), higher values of lactated dehydrogenase (median, 381 U/L vs. 256.5 U/L, p &lt; 0.001), C-reactive protein (median, 10.9 mg/dL vs. 3.8 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.001), D-dimer (median, 2.07 μg/mL vs. 1.28 μg/mL; p = 0.015), lower values of lymphocyte (median, 802/μL vs. 1007/μL, p = 0.025) and C t of the nasopharyngeal PCR assay (median, 20.59 vs. 25.54; p = 0.021) than those without RNAemia. Univariate analysis showed RNAemia was associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 18.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.92–89.76; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.7851; p = 0.002) and critical condition (OR, 72.00; 95% CI, 12.98–399.29; AUC, 0.8198; p &lt; 0.001). Plus, multivariate analysis also revealed the association of RNAemia with critical condition (adjusted OR, 125.71; 95% CI, 11.47–1377.32; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion On-admission SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is a potent predictive marker of COVID-19 critical condition and mortality. The adjusted OR for critical condition was as high as 125.71."
https://openalex.org/W3180877949,"In a compartmental epidemic model, the initial exponential phase reflects a fixed interaction between an infectious agent and a susceptible population in steady state, so it determines the basic reproduction number R 0 on its own. After the exponential phase, dynamic complexities like societal responses muddy the practical interpretation of many estimated parameters. The computer program ARRP, already available from sequence alignment applications, automatically estimated the end of the exponential phase in COVID-19 and extracted the exponential growth rate r for 160 countries. By positing a gamma-distributed generation time, the exponential growth method then yielded R 0 estimates for COVID-19 in 160 countries. The use of ARRP ensured that the R 0 estimates were largely freed from any dependency outside the exponential phase. The Prem matrices quantify rates of effective contact for infectious disease. Without using any age-stratified COVID-19 data, but under strong assumptions about the homogeneity of susceptibility, infectiousness, etc., across different age-groups, the Prem contact matrices also yielded theoretical R 0 estimates for COVID-19 in 152 countries, generally in quantitative conflict with the R 0 estimates derived from the exponential growth method. An exploratory analysis manipulating only the Prem contact matrices reduced the conflict, suggesting that age-groups under 20 years did not promote the initial exponential growth of COVID-19 as much as other age-groups. The analysis therefore supports tentatively and tardily, but independently of age-stratified COVID-19 data, the low priority given to vaccinating younger age groups. It also supports the judicious reopening of schools. The exploratory analysis also supports the possibility of suspecting differences in epidemic spread among different age-groups, even before substantial amounts of age-stratified data become available."
https://openalex.org/W3182238881,"The Chilean health authorities have implemented a sanitary strategy known as dynamic quarantine or strategic quarantine to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this system, lockdowns were established, lifted, or prolonged according to the weekly health authorities’ assessment of municipalities’ epidemiological situation. The public announcements about the confinement situation of municipalities country-wide are made typically on Tuesdays or Wednesdays before noon, have received extensive media coverage, and generated sharp stock market fluctuations. Municipalities are the smallest administrative division in Chile, with each city broken down typically into several municipalities. We analyze social media behavior in response to the confinement situation of the population at the municipal level. The dynamic quarantine scheme offers a unique opportunity for our analysis, given that municipalities display a high degree of heterogeneity, both in size and in the socioeconomic status of their population. We exploit the variability over time in municipalities’ confinement situations, resulting from the dynamic quarantine strategy, and the cross-sectional variability in their socioeconomic characteristics to evaluate the impact of these characteristics on social sentiment. Using event study and panel data methods, we find that proxies for social sentiment based on Twitter queries are negatively related (more pessimistic) to increases in the number of confined people, but with a statistically significant effect concentrated on people from the wealthiest cohorts of the population. For indicators of social sentiment based on Google Trends, we found that search intensity during the periods surrounding government announcements is positively related to increases in the total number of confined people. Still, this effect does not seem to be dependent on the segments of the population affected by the quarantine. Furthermore, we show that the observed heterogeneity in sentiment mirrors heterogeneity in stock market reactions to government announcements. We provide evidence that the observed stock market behavior around quarantine announcements can be explained by the number of people from the wealthiest segments of the population entering or exiting lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W3180299875,"Due to the combined effects of urban growth and climate change, rapid urbanisation is particularly challenging in African cities. Areas that will house a large proportion of the urban population in the future coincide with where natural hazards are expected to occur, and where hazard risk management institutions, knowledge, and capacity are often lacking. One of the challenges posed by rapid urbanisation is the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, whereby urban areas are warmer than the surrounding rural areas. This study investigates urbanisation patterns and alterations in surface UHI (SUHI) intensity for the Kampala urban cluster, Uganda. Analyses show that between 1995 and 2017, Kampala underwent extensive changes to its urban built-up area. From the centre of the city to adjoining non-built up areas in all directions, the urban land cover increased from 12,133 ha in 1995 to 25,389 ha in 2016. The area of SUHI intensity in Kampala expanded significantly over the 15-year period of study, expanding from 22,910 ha in 2003 to 27,900 ha in 2016, while the annual daytime SUHI of 2.2°C in 2003 had decreased to 1.9°C by 2017. Although SUHI intensity decreased in some parts of the city, elsewhere it increased, suggesting that urbanisation does not always lead to a deterioration of environmental conditions. We postulate that urban development may therefore not necessarily create an undesirable impact on local climate if it is properly managed. Rapidly growing cities in Africa and elsewhere should ensure that the dynamics of their development are directed towards mitigating potentially harmful environmental impacts, such as UHI effect through careful planning that considers both bluespaces and greenspaces."
https://openalex.org/W3181850326,"Reopening amid the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a battle on social media. The supporters perceived that the lockdown policy could damage the economy and exacerbate social inequality. By contrast, the opponents believed it was necessary to contain the spread and ensure a safe environment for recovery. Anatomy into the battle is of importance to address public concerns, beliefs, and values, thereby enabling policymakers to determine the appropriate solutions to implement reopening policy. To this end, we investigated over 1.5 million related Twitter postings from April 17 to May 30, 2020. With the aid of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers, we classified each tweet into either a “supporting” or “opposing” class and then investigated the public perception from temporal and spatial perspectives. From the temporal dimension, we found that both political and scientific news that were extensively discussed on Twitter led to the perception of opposing reopening. Further, being the first mover with full reopen adversely affected the public reaction to reopening policy, while being the follower or late mover resulted in positive responses. From the spatial dimension, the correlation and regression analyses suggest that the state-level perception was very likely to be associated with political affiliation and health value."
https://openalex.org/W3178979594,"Since the inception of the National Programme for Family Planning, messages on family planning (FP) have been promoted across India using different mass media platforms. Mass media plays an important role in disseminating important information among the masses, such as how reversible modern methods give women more reproductive choices than opting for permanent methods that limit their child-bearing capacity. Mass media can provide a continuous flow of information and motivation to deter women from discontinuing the methods they have opted for. However, very few studies have been conducted on this issue, especially using recently available data. This study particularly focuses on exposure to mass media and the use of reversible modern methods of family planning among married women in India. The data for this study was obtained from the National Family Health Survey (2015–16) on currently married women aged 15–49 years. The association of reversible modern method use with media exposure variables was examined, controlling for a set of independent variables from multiple levels—individual, district, state, and region. The findings from this study showed that television was the most important medium for disseminating information on FP among married women in India. Spatial analysis revealed that some districts in the north, parts of the northeast, and Kerala in South India lacked any television exposure. The results from the decomposition analysis showed that mass media exposure was associated with a 14% increase in the use of reversible modern methods. Results from the multilevel analyses showed that exposure to TV along with other media (AOR 1.57 95% CI 1.49–1.65) and exposure to FP messages through different media (AOR 1.22 95% CI 1.12–1.32) had a significant positive effect on the use of reversible modern methods even when various individual, district, state, and regional-level factors were controlled. The findings of this paper provide evidence supporting the use of mass media to promote and increase awareness of voluntary contraceptive use in India. An increase in mass media exposure coupled with improvement in coverage and services of the FP program can significantly increase the use of reversible modern methods in a cost-effective yet efficient manner among women in need of FP services."
https://openalex.org/W3179421927,"We present the development and validation of a mathematical model that predicts how glucose dynamics influence metabolism and therefore tumor cell growth. Glucose, the starting material for glycolysis, has a fundamental influence on tumor cell growth. We employed time-resolved microscopy to track the temporal change of the number of live and dead tumor cells under different initial glucose concentrations and seeding densities. We then constructed a family of mathematical models (where cell death was accounted for differently in each member of the family) to describe overall tumor cell growth in response to the initial glucose and confluence conditions. The Akaikie Information Criteria was then employed to identify the most parsimonious model. The selected model was then trained on 75% of the data to calibrate the system and identify trends in model parameters as a function of initial glucose concentration and confluence. The calibrated parameters were applied to the remaining 25% of the data to predict the temporal dynamics given the known initial glucose concentration and confluence, and tested against the corresponding experimental measurements. With the selected model, we achieved an accuracy (defined as the fraction of measured data that fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the predicted growth curves) of 77.2 ± 6.3% and 87.2 ± 5.1% for live BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3182611089,"Aim This study tested the construct validity (i.e., factor structure) of the Persian Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) on a sample of male prisoners. Methods All the participants (mean±SD age = 39.44±7.94 years) completed three scales—the Persian MAAS, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis with differential item functioning (DIF) were applied to examine the construct validity of the MAAS. Specifically, the DIF was tested across different insomnia status (using ISI with a cutoff of 15), psychiatric well-being status (using GHQ-12 with a cutoff of 12), and age (using mean age of 39.44 as the cutoff). Results The CFA results showed a single factor solution for the Persian MAAS. The Rasch results showed all MAAS items fit in the construct (infit mean square [MnSq] = 0.72 to 1.41; outfit MnSq = 0.74 to 1.39) without displaying DIF items (DIF contrast = -0.34 to 0.31 for insomnia condition; -0.22 to 0.25 for psychiatric well-being; -0.26 to 0.29 for age). Conclusions The Persian version of the MAAS is, therefore, a valid instrument to measure mindfulness among Iranian male prisoners."
https://openalex.org/W3183111976,"Although previous studies have investigated the relationship between fracture risk and type 2 diabetes (T2D), cohort studies that estimate composite osteoporosis risk are lacking. This retrospective cohort study sought to determine the risk of osteoporosis in Taiwanese patients with T2D. Patients diagnosed with T2D between 2002 and 2015 identified through the 2002 Taiwan Survey of Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Hyperlipidemia were included. A total of 1690 men and 1641 women aged ≥40 years linked to the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) were followed up to the end of 2015 to identify the incidences of osteoporosis through ICD9-CM codes for osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures or usage of anti-osteoporotic agents according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes determined from NHIRD. The person year approach and Kaplan–Meier analysis were then used to estimate the incidences and cumulative event rates, whereas the Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for osteoporosis events. A total of 792 new osteoporosis events were documented over a median follow-up duration of 13.6 years. Participants with T2D had higher osteoporosis risk [adjusted HR: 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11–1.69] compared with those without T2D. Subgroup analyses revealed that age had a marginally significant effect, indicating that T2D had a more pronounced effect on osteoporosis risk in younger population (&lt;65 years old). No difference was found between patients stratified according to sex. In conclusion, T2D was significantly associated with increased osteoporosis risk, especially in younger participants."
https://openalex.org/W3181523712,"Fetal movement count monitoring is one of the most commonly used methods of assessing fetal well-being. While few methods are available to monitor fetal movements, they consist of several adverse qualities such as unreliability as well as the inability to be conducted in a non-clinical setting. Therefore, this research was conducted to design a complete system that will enable pregnant mothers to monitor fetal movement at home. This system consists of a non-invasive, non-transmitting sensor unit that can be fabricated at a low cost. An accelerometer was utilized as the primary sensor and a micro-controller based circuit was implemented. Clinical testing was conducted utilizing this sensor unit. Two phases of clinical testing procedures were done and during the first phase readings from 120 mothers were taken while during the second phase readings from 15 mothers were taken. Validation was done by conducting an abdominal ultrasound scan which was utilized as the ground truth during the second phase of the clinical testing procedure. A clinical survey was also conducted in parallel with clinical testings in order to improve the sensor unit as well as to improve the final system. Four different signal processing algorithms were implemented on the data set and the performance of each was compared with each other. Out of the four algorithms three algorithms were able to obtain a true positive rate around 85%. However, the best algorithm was selected on the basis of minimizing the false positive rate. Consequently, the most feasible as well as the best performing algorithm was determined and it was utilized in the final system. This algorithm have a true positive rate of 86% and a false positive rate of 7% Furthermore, a mobile application was also developed to be used with the sensor unit by pregnant mothers. Finally, a complete end to end method to monitor fetal movement in a non-clinical setting was presented by the proposed system."
https://openalex.org/W3177863049,"Sudden death is the most common mode of mortality in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Ventricular arrhythmias (VA) have been suspected as the etiology but the supporting evidence in patients with HFpEF is scarce. We sought to investigate VA prevalence, and to determine if VA are associated with prolonged repolarization, in patients with HFpEF. In a retrospective case-control study design, Cedars-Sinai patients who underwent prolonged ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (Zio Patch) between 2016 and 2018 were screened for a clinical diagnosis of HFpEF. Patients with normal diastolic and systolic function who underwent Zio Patch monitoring were also reviewed as controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare the prevalence of rhythm disturbances in patients with and without HFpEF. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) was more prevalent in patients with HFpEF (37% vs. 16% in controls, p = 0.001). Most episodes were non-sustained except for one case of sustained VT in a patient with HFpEF. Covariate-adjusted logistic regression including HFpEF diagnosis, age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of comorbidities revealed that only HFpEF was associated with increased risk of VT (relative risk 2.86, p = 0.023). Subgroup-analyses revealed an association between increased QTc interval and risk of VT (460 ± 38 ms in HFpEF patients with VT vs. 445 ± 28 ms in HFpEF patients without VT, p = 0.03). Non-sustained VT was more prevalent in patients with HFpEF compared to patients without HFpEF, and QTc interval prolongation was associated with VT in HFpEF."
https://openalex.org/W3179177750,"Tropical cyclones have large effects on marine ecosystems through direct (e.g., storm surge) and indirect (e.g., nutrient runoff) effects. Given their intensity, understanding their effects on the marine environment is an important goal for conservation and resource management. In June 2012, Tropical Storm Debby impacted coastal Florida including Tampa Bay. Acoustic recorders were deployed prior to the storm at a shallow water location inside Tampa Bay and a deeper water location in the Gulf of Mexico. Ambient noise levels were significantly higher during the storm, and the highest increases were observed at lower frequencies (≤ 500 Hz). Although the storm did not directly hit the area, mean ambient noise levels were as high as 13.5 dB RMS above levels in non-storm conditions. At both the shallow water and the deep water station, the rate of fish calls showed a variety of patterns over the study period, with some rates decreasing during the storm and others showing no apparent reaction. The rates of fish calls were frequently correlated with storm conditions (storm surge, water temperature), but also with lunar cycle. Reactions to the storm were generally stronger in the inshore station, although fish sounds increased quickly after the storm's passage. Although this was not a major tropical cyclone nor a direct hit on the area, the storm did appear to elicit a behavioral response from the fish community, and ambient noise levels likely limited the abilities of marine species to use sound for activities such as communication. Given the increases in intensity and rainfall predicted for tropical cyclones due to climate change, further studies of the ecological effects of tropical cyclones are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3179832091,"In the absence of a gold standard criterion for diagnosing prosthetic joint infections (PJI), sonication of the removed implant may provide superior microbiological identification to synovial fluid and peri-implant tissue cultures. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the role of sonication culture compared to tissue cultures for diagnosing PJI, using different consensus and international guidelines for PJI definition.Data of 146 patients undergoing removal of hip or knee arthroplasties between 2010 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The International Consensus Meeting (ICM-2018), Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS), and a modified clinical criterion, were used to compare the performance of microbiological tests. McNemar´s test and proportion comparison were employed to calculate p-value.Overall, 56% (82/146) were diagnosed with PJI using the clinical criteria. Out of these cases, 57% (47/82) tested positive on tissue culture and 93% (76/82) on sonication culture. Applying this clinical criterion, the sensitivity of sonication fluid and tissue cultures was 92.7% (95% CI: 87.1%- 98.3%) and 57.3% (95% CI: 46.6%-68.0%) (p<0.001), respectively. When both methods were combined for diagnosis (sonication and tissue cultures) sensitivity reached 96.3% (95% CI: 91.5%-100%). Sonication culture and the combination of sonication with tissue cultures, showed higher sensitivity rates than tissue cultures alone for all diagnostic criteria (ICM-18, MSIS, IDSA and EBJIS) applied. Conversely, tissue culture provided greater specificity than sonication culture for all the criteria assessed, except for the EBJIS criteria, in which sonication and tissue cultures specificity was 100% and 95.3% (95% CI: 87.8-100%), respectively (p = 0.024).In a context where diagnostic criteria available have shortcomings and tissue cultures remain the gold standard, sonication cultures can aid PJI diagnosis, especially when diagnostic criteria are inconclusive due to some important missing data (joint puncture, histology)."
https://openalex.org/W3180760560,"Network connectivity has been thoroughly investigated in several domains, including physics, neuroscience, and social sciences. This work tackles the possibility of characterizing the topological properties of real-world networks from a quantum-inspired perspective. Starting from the normalized Laplacian of a network, we use a well-defined procedure, based on the dressing transformations, to derive a 1-dimensional Schrödinger-like equation characterized by the same eigenvalues. We investigate the shape and properties of the potential appearing in this equation in simulated small-world and scale-free network ensembles, using measures of fractality. Besides, we employ the proposed framework to compare real-world networks with the Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz and Barabási-Albert benchmark models. Reconstructed potentials allow to assess to which extent real-world networks approach these models, providing further insight on their formation mechanisms and connectivity properties."
https://openalex.org/W3181470875,"Uncertainty is a crucial issue for any risk assessment. Consequently, it also poses crucial challenges for risk communications. Many guidebooks advise reporting uncertainties in risk assessments, expecting that the audience will appreciate this disclosure. However, the empirical evidence about the effects of uncertainty reporting is sparse and inconclusive. Therefore, based on examples of potential health risks of electromagnetic fields (EMF), three experiments were conducted analysing the effects of communicating uncertainties separately for hazard identification, risk characterisation and risk protection. The setups aimed to explore how reporting and how explaining of uncertainty affects dependent variables such as risk perception, perceived competence of the risk assessors, and trust in risk management. Each of the three experiments used a 2x2 design with a first factor presenting uncertainty descriptions (as used in public controversies on EMF related health effects) or describing a certainty conditions; and a second factor explaining the causes of uncertainties (by pointing at knowledge gaps) or not explaining them. The study results indicate that qualitative uncertainty descriptions regarding hazard identification reduce the confidence in the professional competencies of the assessors. In contrast, a quantitative uncertainty description in risk characterisation-regarding the magnitude of the risk-does not affect any of the dependent variables. Concerning risk protection, trust in exposure limit values is not affected by qualitative uncertainty information. However, the qualitative description of uncertainty regarding the adequacy of protection amplifies fears. Furthermore, explaining this uncertainty results in lower text understandability."
https://openalex.org/W3181497107,"Background Individuals with previous syphilis may experience cognitive impairment. The goal of this study was to determine if those at high risk for laboratory-defined neurosyphilis are cognitively impaired, and whether treatment based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings results in better outcomes. Methods Participants had a new syphilis diagnosis, serum RPR titer ≥ 1:32 or peripheral blood CD4+ T cells ≤ 350/ul (in persons living with HIV) and did not endorse neurological symptoms. They underwent computerized cognitive assessment with the CogState. Thirty-two were randomized to either undergo lumbar puncture (LP) or to not undergo LP and 14 underwent LP; 64 were not randomized and 48 opted to undergo LP. Results Demographics, cognitive complaints and cognitive impairment did not differ between randomized and nonrandomized participants. Two-thirds were cognitively impaired, and impairment was not more common in those with cognitive complaints. The adjusted odds of increased severity of impairment were 3.8 times greater in those with CSF pleocytosis compared to those without. Time to cognitive normalization, improvement or decline did not differ between those who did not undergo LP and those who underwent LP and whose treatment was based on CSF analysis. Taking into account pre-treatment cognitive impairment, the risk of cognitive decline was lower in those with CSF pleocytosis treated for neurosyphilis compared to those without CSF pleocytosis not treated for neurosyphilis, (HR 0.24 (95% CI 0.07–0.88], p = 0.03). Conclusion In individuals at high risk for laboratory-defined neurosyphilis, cognitive complaints are not a good indicator of cognitive impairment. Severity of cognitive impairment was greater in those with CSF pleocytosis. Identification and treatment of those with neurosyphilis may mitigate subsequent cognitive decline."

Therefore, the DFS-2 has been developed as an instrument to measure an individual's dispositional tendency to flow state as a personality trait.Aiming to obtain an adapted version of the DFS-2 for the Brazilian-Portuguese language (DFS-BR) and for general activities, we performed its forward- and backward-translation, and we validated it.After gathering answers from 681 Brazilian participants, we performed: (1) the construct validity of the DFS-BR; and (2) the psychometric item quality analysis.the Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (CFA) indicates the best fit for the gathered data is a nine multi-correlated factorial model (χ2/df = 4.23, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93 and RMSEA = 0.069). Reliability tests performed in this structure indicates excellent internal consistency for the DFS-BR. The item quality analysis indicates that its difficulty and discriminating parameters have a good endorsement to estimate the dispositional flow state. Additionally, we proposed and validated a short version of the DFS-BR (composed of only nine items). The validation results indicates good fit (χ2/df = 2.94, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97 and RMSEA = 0.053) and good internal consistency. The Test Information Curve of the short version indicates that it is very informative in the estimation of individual dispositional flow state.In view of these results, we conclude that the DFS-BR showed good evidence of its validity to be used with Brazilian people. We also suggest the use of a short version when we need only measure the person's flow state based on the principle of Occam's razor. This principle is supported by the analysis presented in this article."
https://openalex.org/W3177861453,"Abcg2/Bcrp and Abcb1a/Pgp are xenobiotic efflux transporters limiting substrate permeability in the gastrointestinal system and brain, and increasing renal and hepatic drug clearance. The systemic impact of Bcrp and Pgp ablation on metabolic homeostasis of endogenous substrates is incompletely understood. We performed untargeted metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, transcriptomics of brain, liver and kidney from male Sprague Dawley rats (WT) and Bcrp/Pgp double knock-out (dKO) rats, and integrated metabolomic/transcriptomic analysis to identify putative substrates and perturbations in canonical metabolic pathways. A predictive Bayesian machine learning model was used to predict in silico those metabolites with greater substrate-like features for either transporters. The CSF and plasma levels of 169 metabolites, nutrients, signaling molecules, antioxidants and lipids were significantly altered in dKO rats, compared to WT rats. These metabolite changes suggested alterations in histidine, branched chain amino acid, purine and pyrimidine metabolism in the dKO rats. Levels of methylated and sulfated metabolites and some primary bile acids were increased in dKO CSF or plasma. Elevated uric acid levels appeared to be a primary driver of changes in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Alterations in Bcrp/Pgp dKO CSF levels of antioxidants, precursors of neurotransmitters, and uric acid suggests the transporters may contribute to the regulation of a healthy central nervous system in rats. Microbiome-generated metabolites were found to be elevated in dKO rat plasma and CSF. The altered dKO metabolome appeared to cause compensatory transcriptional change in urate biosynthesis and response to lipopolysaccharide in brain, oxidation-reduction processes and response to oxidative stress and porphyrin biosynthesis in kidney, and circadian rhythm genes in liver. These findings present insight into endogenous functions of Bcrp and Pgp, the impact that transporter substrates, inhibitors or polymorphisms may have on metabolism, how transporter inhibition could rewire drug sensitivity indirectly through metabolic changes, and identify functional Bcrp biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3177884570,"Cancer Screening is a key approach to detect cancer at an early stage and help reduce cancer mortality globally. Inadequate Cancer Literacy may pose a barrier to patient engagement in getting screened for cancer. This study assessed Cancer Screening behavior and its association with Cancer Literacy and other factors among adults of Kaski district, Nepal. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 180 adults from March to August 2019, selected using a multi-stage random sampling method. Data on demographics, history of cancer, use of naturopathy, fatalism, family support, cancer literacy and cancer screening behaviour were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, with the aid of face-to-face interviews. Cancer Literacy was measured using a cancer health literacy tool (CHLT-6), and Cancer Screening behaviour was assessed on the basis of the self reported information about having gone through any type of cancer screening in the past. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated to determine the strength of association using Multivariate Logistic Regression analysis. Only 43.4% of the respondents had Cancer Literacy scores more than the median and only 11.7% had ever gone through any Cancer Screening test in the past. In this study, Cancer Screening behaviour was significantly associated with Cancer Literacy [OR = 1.43, 95% CI (1.01–2.02)]. Similarly, significant association was found between Cancer Screening behaviour and other exposure variables such as age [OR = 1.06, 95% CI (1.02–1.11)] and gender [OR = 0.06, 95% CI (0.01–0.35)]. This study showed low cancer screening and cancer literacy scores amongst the respondents. This suggests that to tackle the ever increasing burden of cancer and hence, to increase cancer screening, we need to focus on improving knowledge and awareness about cancer, as well as, on targeting efforts towards people’s understanding of basic health and cancer terminologies."
https://openalex.org/W3178832045,"Caucasian clover is the only perennial herb of the genus Leguminous clover with underground rhizomes. However, we know very little about its development process and mechanism. Transcriptome studies were conducted on the roots of Caucasian clover without a rhizome (NR) at the young seedling stage and the fully developed rhizome, including the root neck (R1), main root (R2), horizontal root (R3), and rhizome bud (R4), of the tissues in the mature phase. Compared with the rhizome in the mature phase, NR had 893 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), most of which were enriched in 'phenylpropanoid biosynthesis', 'phenylalanine metabolism', 'DNA replication' and 'biosynthesis of amino acids'. A higher number of transcription factors (AP2/ERF, C2H2 and FAR1) were found in NR. There were highly expressed genes for R4, such as auxin response factor SAUR, galacturonosyltransferase (GAUT), and sucrose synthase (SUS). Phenylpropanoids are very important for the entire process of rhizome development. We drew a cluster heat map of genes related to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, in which the largest number of genes belonged to COMT, and most of them were upregulated in R4."
https://openalex.org/W3177702265,"Background Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is not very often used by physicians in Lebanon despite evidence on its positive effects on health-related quality of life. Aim This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of PR among physicians in Lebanon. In addition, the study identifies the main barriers to access to PR according to chest physicians. Insight into these issues will help to increase awareness about the need for PR programs and can contribute to designing such programs in the country. Methods A survey was conducted during the regional conference of the Lebanese Pulmonary Society. One week after the initial survey, the survey questionnaire was sent by email to all chest physicians who were registered with the Lebanese Pulmonary Society but did not attend the conference. A 25-item questionnaire was used to collect information on PR. Results Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The response rate was 40%. Results show that only one-third of Lebanese chest physicians have good knowledge about the nature and multidisciplinary content of PR. Physicians generally support the current “Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program” in Beirut. Key barriers found are the lack of referral, lack of motivation by patients due to their health, cost of care and lack of qualified health care specialists in Lebanon. Conclusion Absence of awareness and education about PR among healthcare providers plays an important role in increasing access to the “Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program”. Awareness campaigns and education for physicians, health care professionals and patients should be considered to increase PR in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3180233221,"Experiences of parents and/or offspring are often assumed to affect the development of trait values in offspring because they provide information about the external environment. However, it is currently unclear how information from parental and offspring experiences might jointly affect the information-states that provide the foundation for the offspring phenotypes observed in empirical studies of developmental plasticity in response to environmental cues. We analyze Bayesian models designed to mimic fully-factorial experimental studies of trans and within- generational plasticity (TWP), in which parents, offspring, both or neither are exposed to cues from predators, to determine how different durations of cue exposure for parents and offspring, the devaluation of information from parents or the degradation of information from parents would affect offspring estimates of environmental states related to risk of predation at the end of such experiments. We show that the effects of different cue durations, the devaluation of information from parents, and the degradation of information from parents on offspring estimates are all expected to vary as a function of interactions with two other key components of information-based models of TWP: parental priors and the relative cue reliability in the different treatments. Our results suggest empiricists should expect to observe considerable variation in the patterns observed in experimental studies of TWP based on simple principles of information-updating, without needing to invoke additional assumptions about costs, tradeoffs, development constraints, the fitness consequences of different trait values, or other factors."
https://openalex.org/W3179904028,"Background Many new cancer drugs are being approved by reputed regulatory authorities without evidence of overall survival benefit, quality of life improvement, and often based on clinical trials at high risk of bias. In recent years, most Latin American (LA) countries have reformed their marketing authorization (MA) rules to directly accept or abbreviate the approval process in case of earlier authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration, mainly. This study assessed the potential impact of decisions taken by EMA regarding the approval of new cancer drugs based on no evidence of overall survival or in potentially biased clinical trials in LA countries. Design Descriptive analysis. Setting Publicly accessible marketing authorization databases from LA regulators, European Public Assessment Report by EMA, and previous studies accessing EMA approvals of new cancer drugs 2009–2016. Main outcome and measures Number of new cancer drugs approved by LA countries without evidence of overall survival (2009–2013), and without at least one clinical trial scored at low risk of bias, or with no trial supporting the marketing authorization at all (2014–2016). Results Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru have publicly accessible and trustful MA databases and were included. Of the 17 cancer drugs approved by EMA (2009–2013) without evidence of OS benefit after a postmarketing median time of 5.4 years, 6 LA regulators approved more than 70% of them. Of the 13 drugs approved by EMA (2014–2016), either without supporting trial or with no trial at low risk of bias, Brazil approved 11, Chile 10, Peru 10, Argentina 10, Colombia 9, Ecuador 9, and Panama 8. Conclusions LA countries keep approving new cancer drugs often based on poorly performed clinical trials measuring surrogate endpoints. EMA and other reputed regulators must be aware that their regulatory decisions might directly influence decisions regarding MA, health budgets and patient’s care elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W3180094285,"Background and aims The Apo B/A1 ratio is a major factor that predicts future cardiovascular outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the apolipoprotein B (Apo B)/apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) is a better predictor of future outcome than the total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C ratio or lipoprotein (a) (Lp (a)) after the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therefore, we performed this study to evaluate the impact of the Apo B/A1 ratio on the patients who achieved LDL-C below 70 mg/dL one year after PCI. Methods We included 448 PCI patients whose LDL-C levels were below 70 mg/dL at follow-up. The Apo B/A1 ratio, TC/HDL-C ratio, and Lp (a) levels were measured at the time of PCI and follow-up, and decreases in these parameters between baseline and follow-up were assessed as potential markers to predict major cardiovascular adverse events (MACEs). Results During a median follow-up period of 38.0 months, 115 MACEs were recorded. The tertile with the lowest decrease in the Apo B/A1 ratio (≤ 0.146) showed a lower MACE survival rate compared to the other tertiles. There were no differences in MACE survival rates for the TC/HDL-C ratio or Lp (a) levels. Conclusions The Apo B/A1 ratio had better predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes compared to the TC/HDL-C ratio and Lp (a) level. A lower decrease in the Apo B/A1 ratio may be a residual risk factor for MACEs in patients who have reached LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL after PCI."
https://openalex.org/W3181543937,"Introduction Disseminated infection due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria has been a major factor of mortality and comorbidity in HIV patients. Until 2018, U.S. American guidelines have recommended antimycobacterial prophylaxis in patients with low CD4 cell counts, a practice that has not been adopted in Europe. This study aimed at examining the impact of disseminated NTM disease on clinical outcome in German HIV patients with a severe immunodeficiency. Materials and methods In this retrospective case control study, HIV patients with disseminated NTM disease were identified by retrospective chart review and matched by their CD4 cell counts to HIV patients without NTM infection in a 1:1 alocation. Primary endpoints were mortality and time to first rehospitalisation. In addition, other opportunistic diseases, as well as antimycobacterial and antiretroviral treatments were examined. Results Between 2006 and 2016, we identified 37 HIV patients with disseminated NTM disease. Most of them were suffering from infections due to M . avium complex ( n = 31, 77.5%). Time to event analysis showed a non-significant trend to higher mortality in patients with disseminated NTM disease (p = 0.24). Rehospitalisation took place significantly earlier in patients with disseminated NTM infections (median 40.5 days vs. 109 days, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion In this retrospective case control study, we could demonstrate that mortality is not significantly higher in HIV patients with disseminated NTM disease in the ART era, but that they require specialised medical attention in the first months following discharge."
https://openalex.org/W3178636176,"Background Information on how well Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) works on reducing TB incidence among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in routine settings using robust statistical methods to establish causality in observational studies is scarce. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of IPT in routine clinical settings by comparing TB incidence between IPT and non-IPT groups. Methods We used data from PLHIV enrolled in 315 HIV care and treatment clinic from January 2012 to December 2016. We used Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting to adjust for the probability of receiving IPT; balancing the baseline covariates between IPT and non-IPT groups. The effectiveness of IPT on TB incidence was estimated using Cox regression using the weighted sample. Results Of 171,743 PLHIV enrolled in the clinics over the five years, 10,326 (6.01%) were excluded leaving 161,417 available for the analysis. Of the 24,800 who received IPT, 1.00% developed TB disease whereas of the 136,617 who never received IPT 6,085 (4.98%) developed TB disease. In 278,545.90 person-years of follow up, a total 7,052 new TB cases were diagnosed. Using the weighted sample, the overall TB incidence was 11.57 (95% CI: 11.09–12.07) per 1,000 person-years. The TB incidence among PLHIV who received IPT was 10.49 (95% CI: 9.11–12.15) per 1,000 person-years and 12.00 (95% CI: 11.69–12.33) per 1,000 person-years in those who never received IPT. After adjusting for other covariates there was 52% lower risk of developing TB disease among those who received IPT compared to those who never received IPT: aHR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.40–0.58, P&lt;0.001). Conclusion IPT reduced TB incidence by 52% in PLHIV attending routine CTC in Tanzania. IPTW adjusted the groups for imbalances in the covariates associated with receiving IPT to achieve comparable groups of IPT and non-IPT. This study has added evidence on the effectiveness of IPT in routine clinical settings and on the use of IPTW to determine impact of interventions in observational studies."
https://openalex.org/W3180085485,"Objectives To characterize the pattern of approved anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments among patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Method This was a retrospective, nonrandomized, observational cohort analysis of the Dubai Real-world Claims Database with a 360-day follow-up period. Adult patients diagnosed with nAMD or DME treated with ranibizumab or aflibercept for the first time were included. The primary objective was to evaluate anti-VEGF treatment patterns with respect to the proportion of patients receiving ranibizumab and aflibercept for nAMD and DME separately. Results Of the 451 patients included in the final study cohort, 83.6% and 16.4% had a diagnosis of DME (ranibizumab: 48.5%; aflibercept: 51.5%) and nAMD (ranibizumab: 40.5%; aflibercept: 59.5%), respectively, at baseline. Treatment frequency of ranibizumab/aflibercept was similar for nAMD (mean: 2.4/2.9 injections; p = 0.2389) with fewer injections in the ranibizumab cohort for DME (mean: 1.9/2.5 injections; p = 0.0002). Most patients received ≤3 anti-VEGF injections during the 360-day follow-up period. The time between consecutive treatments was large (nAMD: 73.6 days/10.5 weeks; DME: 80.5 days/11.5 weeks). Approximately 10%–13.5% of patients switched their anti-VEGF therapy. Most patients (83.8%) had a diabetes diagnosis during the follow-up period. Conclusions This real-world study provides an initial understanding of anti-VEGF treatment patterns in patients with nAMD and DME in the UAE. Treatment frequency of the 2 anti-VEGF agents assessed was similar in both patient populations. Both treatments were infrequently administered with large dosing intervals."
https://openalex.org/W3180249626,"Purpose Volumetric liver fat fraction (VLFF) measurements were made using the HepaFat-Scan ® technique at 1.5T and 3T to determine the agreement between the measurements obtained at the two fields. Methods Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes (67% male, mean age 50.92 ± 6.56yrs) and thirty healthy volunteers (50% male, mean age 48.63 ± 6.32yrs) were scanned on 1.5T Aera and 3T Skyra (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) MRI scanners on the same day using the HepaFat-Scan ® gradient echo protocol with modification of echo times for 3T (TEs 2.38, 4.76, 7.14 ms at 1.5T and 1.2, 2.4, 3.6 ms at 3T). The 3T analyses were performed independently of the 1.5T analyses by a different analyst, blinded from the 1.5T results. Data were analysed for agreement and bias using Bland-Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). A second cohort of 17 participants underwent interstudy repeatability assessment of VLFF measured by HepaFat-Scan ® at 3T. Results A small, but statistically significant mean bias of 0.48% was observed between 3T and 1.5T with 95% limits of agreement -2.2% to 3.2% VLFF. The ICC for agreement between field strengths was 0.983 (95% CI 0.972–0.989). In the repeatability cohort studied at 3T the repeatability coefficient was 4.2%. The ICC for agreement was 0.971 (95% CI 0.921–0.989). Conclusion There is minimal bias and excellent agreement between the measures of VLFF using the HepaFat-Scan ® at 1.5 and 3T. The test retest repeatability coefficient at 3T is comparable to the 95% limits of agreement between 1.5T and 3T suggesting that measurements can be made interchangeably between field strengths."
https://openalex.org/W3182965360,"The treatment of complex diseases often relies on combinatorial therapy, a strategy where drugs are used to target multiple genes simultaneously. Promising candidate genes for combinatorial perturbation often constitute epistatic genes, i.e., genes which contribute to a phenotype in a non-linear fashion. Experimental identification of the full landscape of genetic interactions by perturbing all gene combinations is prohibitive due to the exponential growth of testable hypotheses. Here we present a model for the inference of pairwise epistatic, including synthetic lethal, gene interactions from siRNA-based perturbation screens. The model exploits the combinatorial nature of siRNA-based screens resulting from the high numbers of sequence-dependent off-target effects, where each siRNA apart from its intended target knocks down hundreds of additional genes. We show that conditional and marginal epistasis can be estimated as interaction coefficients of regression models on perturbation data. We compare two methods, namely glinternet and xyz , for selecting non-zero effects in high dimensions as components of the model, and make recommendations for the appropriate use of each. For data simulated from real RNAi screening libraries, we show that glinternet successfully identifies epistatic gene pairs with high accuracy across a wide range of relevant parameters for the signal-to-noise ratio of observed phenotypes, the effect size of epistasis and the number of observations per double knockdown. xyz is also able to identify interactions from lower dimensional data sets (fewer genes), but is less accurate for many dimensions. Higher accuracy of glinternet , however, comes at the cost of longer running time compared to xyz . The general model is widely applicable and allows mining the wealth of publicly available RNAi screening data for the estimation of epistatic interactions between genes. As a proof of concept, we apply the model to search for interactions, and potential targets for treatment, among previously published sets of siRNA perturbation screens on various pathogens. The identified interactions include both known epistatic interactions as well as novel findings."
https://openalex.org/W3163897614,"Technological advances in robotics have already produced robots that are indistinguishable from human beings. This technology is overcoming the uncanny valley, which refers to the unpleasant feelings that arise from humanoid robots that are similar in appearance to real humans to some extent. If humanoid robots with the same appearance are mass-produced and become commonplace, we may encounter circumstances in which people or human-like products have faces with the exact same appearance in the future. This leads to the following question: what impressions do clones elicit? To respond to this question, we examined what impressions images of people with the same face (clone images) induce. In the six studies we conducted, we consistently reported that clone images elicited higher eeriness than individuals with different faces; we named this new phenomenon the clone devaluation effect. We found that the clone devaluation effect reflected the perceived improbability of facial duplication. Moreover, this phenomenon was related to distinguishableness of each face, the duplication of identity, the background scene in observing clone faces, and avoidance reactions based on disgust sensitivity. These findings suggest that the clone devaluation effect is a product of multiple processes related to memory, emotion, and face recognition systems."
https://openalex.org/W3179620073,"As a powerful tool in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, sparse representation has gained much attention in recent years owing to its detailed representation of features. In particular, the results of the joint use of spatial and spectral information has been widely applied to HSI classification. However, dealing with the spatial relationship between pixels is a nontrivial task. This paper proposes a new spatial-spectral combined classification method that considers the boundaries of adjacent features in the HSI. Based on the proposed method, a smoothing-constraint Laplacian vector is constructed, which consists of the interest pixel and its four nearest neighbors through their weighting factor. Then, a novel large-block sparse dictionary is developed for simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit. Our proposed method can obtain a better accuracy of HSI classification on three real HSI datasets than the existing spectral-spatial HSI classifiers. Finally, the experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3179996050,"Planting soybeans ( Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in tea gardens decreased soil pH in theory but increased it in practice. This controversy was addressed in this study by treating the tea garden soil consecutively with different parts of a soybean cover crop: aboveground soybean (ASB) parts, underground soybean (USB) root residues, and the whole soybean (WSB) plants. In comparison with the control, the soil pH increased significantly after the third ASB and WSB treatments, but there was no significant change in the soil pH in the USB treatment. Concordantly, the soil exchangeable acidity decreased significantly and the soil exchangeable bases increased significantly in the ASB and WSB treatments. The exchangeable acidity increased in the USB treatment, but the amount of the increased acidity was less than that of the increased bases in the ASB treatment, resulting in a net increase in the exchangeable bases in the WSB treatment. Soybean planting and covering also increased the microbial richness and abundance significantly, which led to significantly more soil organic matters. Exchangeable K + and Mg 2+ , and soil organic matters played significantly positive roles and exchangeable Al 3+ played negative roles in improving soil pH. Our data suggest that consecutive plantings of soybean cover crop increase the pH of the acidified tea garden soil."

https://openalex.org/W3181576115,"Background The burden of heart failure is growing in sub-Saharan Africa, but there is a dearth of data characterizing care and outcomes of heart failure patients in the region, particularly in emergency department settings. Methods In a prospective observational study, adult patients presenting with shortness of breath or chest pain to an emergency department in northern Tanzania were consecutively enrolled. Participants with a physician-documented clinical diagnosis of heart failure were included in the present analysis. Standardized questionnaires regarding medical history and medication use were administered at enrollment, and treatments given in the emergency department were recorded. Thirty days after enrollment, a follow-up questionnaire was administered to assess mortality and medication use. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify baseline predictors of thirty-day mortality. Results Of 1020 enrolled participants enrolled from August 2018 through October 2019, 267 patients (26.2%) were diagnosed with heart failure. Of these, 139 (52.1%) reported a prior history of heart failure, 168 (62.9%) had self-reported history of hypertension, and 186 (69.7%) had NYHA Class III or IV heart failure. At baseline, 40 (15.0%) reported taking a diuretic and 67 (25.1%) reported taking any antihypertensive. Thirty days following presentation, 63 (25.4%) participants diagnosed with heart failure had died. Of 185 surviving participants, 16 (8.6%) reported taking a diuretic, 24 (13.0%) reported taking an antihypertensive, and 26 (14.1%) were rehospitalized. Multivariate predictors of thirty-day mortality included self-reported hypertension (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21–0.86], p = 0.017) and symptomatic leg swelling at presentation (OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.35–5.56, p = 0.006). Conclusion In a northern Tanzanian emergency department, heart failure is a common clinical diagnosis, but uptake of evidence-based outpatient therapies is poor and thirty-day mortality is high. Interventions are needed to improve care and outcomes for heart failure patients in the emergency department setting."
https://openalex.org/W3182624811,"Objectives Autoimmune bullous diseases vary in their clinico-epidemiological features and burden across populations. Data about these diseases was lacking in Sudan. We aimed to describe the epidemiological profile and to estimate the burden of autoimmune bullous diseases in Sudan. Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at Khartoum Dermatological and Venereal Diseases Teaching Hospital. We used routinely collected health care data, and included all patients with an autoimmune bullous disease who presented to the hospital between 2001 and 2016. Results Out of the 4736 patients who were admitted to the hospital during the study period, 923 (19.5%) had an autoimmune bullous disease. The average rate of patients at the hospital was 57.7 per year representing 1.3 per 100,000 population per year. After exclusion of patients where the final diagnosis was missing, 585 were included in the further analysis. Pemphigus vulgaris was the most common disease (50.9%), followed by bullous pemphigoid (28.2%), linear IgA disease/chronic bullous disease of childhood (8.4%), and pemphigus foliaceous (8.2%). Pemphigoid gestationis and IgA pemphigus constituted 1.4% and 1.2% of the cohort, respectively. Paraneoplastic pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, lichen planus pemphigoidis, bullous systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatitis herpetiformis were rare. None of the patients had epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Conclusions The clinico-epidemiological characteristics vary among the types of autoimmune bullous diseases. Females were more predominant in most of them. Sudanese patients tended in general to present at a younger age than other populations. The pool of Sudanese patients with autoimmune bullous diseases is large which requires investigation for the local risk factors and presents a field for future trials."
