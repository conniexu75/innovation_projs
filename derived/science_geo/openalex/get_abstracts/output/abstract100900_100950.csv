https://openalex.org/W2042584344,"c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are closely related; however, they are independently regulated by a variety of environmental stimuli. Although molecules linking growth factor receptors to MAPKs have been recently identified, little is known about pathways controlling JNK activation. Here, we show that in COS-7 cells, activated Ras effectively stimulates MAPK but poorly induces JNK activity. In contrast, mutationally activated Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases potently activate JNK without affecting MAPK, and oncogenic guanine nucleotide exchange factors for these Rho-like proteins selectively stimulate JNK activity. Furthermore, expression of inhibitory molecules for Rho-related GTPases and dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 block JNK activation by oncogenic exchange factors or after induction by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Taken together, these findings strongly support a critical role for Rac1 and Cdc42 in controlling the JNK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2053257956,"The c-fos serum response element (SRE) forms a ternary complex with the transcription factors SRF (serum response factor) and TCF (ternary complex factor). By itself, SRF can mediate transcriptional activation induced by serum, lysophosphatidic acid, or intracellular activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Activated forms of the Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs also activate transcription via SRF and act synergistically at the SRE with signals that activate TCF. Functional Rho is required for signaling to SRF by several stimuli, but not by activated CDC42Hs or Rac1. Activation of the SRF-linked signaling pathway does not correlate with activation of the MAP kinases ERK, SAPK/JNK, or MPK2/p38. Functional Rho is required for regulated activity of the c-fos promoter. These results establish SRF as a nuclear target of a novel Rho-mediated signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2143372911,"In this study, we demonstrate that the CXC family of chemokines displays disparate angiogenic activity depending upon the presence or absence of the ELR motif. CXC chemokines containing the ELR motif (ELR-CXC chemokines) were found to be potent angiogenic factors, inducing both <i>in vitro</i> endothelial chemotaxis and <i>in vivo</i> corneal neovascularization. In contrast, the CXC chemokines lacking the ELR motif, platelet factor 4, interferon γ-inducible protein 10, and monokine induced by γ-interferon, not only failed to induce significant <i>in vitro</i> endothelial cell chemotaxis or <i>in vivo</i> corneal neovacularization but were found to be potent angiostatic factors in the presence of either ELR-CXC chemokines or the unrelated angiogenic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor. Additionally, mutant interleukin-8 proteins lacking the ELR motif demonstrated potent angiostatic effects in the presence of either ELR-CXC chemokines or basic fibroblast growth factor. In contrast, a mutant of monokine induced by γ-interferon containing the ELR motif was found to induce <i>in vivo</i> angiogenic activity. These findings suggest a functional role of the ELR motif in determining the angiogenic or angiostatic potential of CXC chemokines, supporting the hypothesis that the net biological balance between angiogenic and angiostatic CXC chemokines may play an important role in regulating overall angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W258316223,"IN T-cell precursors, the T-cell-receptor β chain is expressed before the T-cell-receptor α chain1,2 and is sufficient to advance T-cell development in the absence of T-cell receptor α chains3–7. In immature T cells, the T-cell-receptor β protein can form disulphide-linked heterodimers with the pre-T-cell-receptor α chain8,9 and associate with signal-transducing CD3 molecules5. The recently cloned pre-T-cell-receptor a gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is expressed in immature but not mature T cells9,10. Here we show that αβ, but not γδ, cell development is severely hampered in pre-T-cell-receptor α-gene-deficient mice, which establishes a crucial role for the pre-T-cell receptor in early thymocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W2111516447,"The post-translationally modified, antimicrobial peptide nisin is secreted by strains of Lactococcus lactis that contain the chromosomally located nisin biosynthetic gene cluster nisABTCIPRKFEG. When a 4-base pair deletion is introduced into the structural nisA gene (ΔnisA), transcription of ΔnisA is abolished. Transcription of the ΔnisA gene is restored by adding subinhibitory amounts of nisin, nisin mutants, or nisin analogs to the culture medium, but not by the unmodified precursor peptide or by several other antimicrobial peptides. Upon disruption of the nisK gene, which encodes a putative sensor protein that belongs to the class of two-component regulators, transcription of ΔnisA was no longer inducible by nisin. Fusion of a nisA promoter fragment to the promoterless reporter gene gusA resulted in expression of gusA in L. lactis NZ9800 (ΔnisA) only upon induction with nisin species. The expression level of gusA was directly related to the amount of inducer that was added extracellularly. These results provide insight into a new mechanism of autoregulation through signal transduction in prokaryotes and demonstrate that antimicrobial peptides can exert a second function as signaling molecules.

The ribosomally synthesized precursor peptide undergoes extensive post-translational modification, which includes dehydration of serine and threonine residues and the formation of thioether bridges called (β-methyl)lanthionines, resulting in five ring structures named A, B, C, D, and E (Fig. 1B). Peptides containing these characteristic modified residues are named lantibiotics(4Schnell N. Entian K.-D. Schneider U. Götz F. Zähner H. Kellner R. Jung G. Nature. 1988; 333: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Eleven genes organized in a cluster have been implicated to be involved in the complex biosynthesis of nisin, i.e. nisABTCIPRKFEG (Fig. 1A)(5Buchman G.W. Banerjee S. Hansen J.N. J. Biol.

Of these genes, nisA encodes the nisin A precursor peptide of 57 amino acid residues; nisB and nisC encode putative enzymes involved in the post-translational modification reactions (based on homology to genes found exclusively in other lantibiotic gene clusters); nisT encodes a putative transport protein of the ABC translocator family that is probably involved in the extrusion of modified precursor nisin(7Engelke G.

Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); nisI encodes a lipoprotein involved in the producer self-protection against nisin(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar); and nisFEG encodes putative transporter proteins that have also been implied in immunity (11Siegers K. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the post-translational events yielding mature nisin A is shown in Fig. 1B. Nisin Z is a natural variant of nisin A that contains an asparagine residue at position 27 instead of the histidine residue found in nisin A(12Mulders J.W.M. Boerrigter I.J. Rollema H.S. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Both nisin A- and nisin Z-producing strains are common in nature, and both structural genes (nisA and nisZ) have been cloned(5Buchman G.W. Banerjee S. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16260-16266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kaletta C. Entian K.-D. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13de Vos W.M. Mulders J.W.M. Siezen R.J. Hugenholtz J. Kuipers O.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 213-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by nisR(8van der Meer J.R. Polman J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nisK(10Engelke G. Gutowski-Eckel Z. Kiesau P. Siegers K. Hammelmann M. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 814-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown to be involved in the regulation of nisin biosynthesis(8van der Meer J.R. Polman J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Engelke G. Gutowski-Eckel Z. Kiesau P. Siegers K. Hammelmann M. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 814-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NisR is a response regulator, and NisK is a sensor histidine kinase which belong to the class of two-component regulatory systems (14Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 16Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the genes nisABTCIR are present on a multicopy plasmid, production of fully modified precursor nisin is observed, indicating that overexpression of nisR alone is sufficient to activate transcription of nisA and obviously also of the biosynthetic genes downstream by partially reading through an inverted repeat sequence (Fig. 1A)(8van der Meer J.R. Polman J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is similar to the regulation of expression of iep and degU genes in Bacillus subtilis, where overexpression of the response regulator activates transcription of the target genes(17Tanaka T. Kawata M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3593-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to the case of overexpression of epiQ, which encodes a response regulator involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin(18Peschel A. Augustin J. Kupke T. Stefanovic S. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When only the genes nisABTCI are present on a multicopy plasmid (pNZ9000) in Lactococcus lactis MG1614, no transcription of nisA is observed(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Two gene products have been identified for the regulation of the biosynthesis of the related lantibiotic subtilin(19Gross E. Kiltz H.H. Craig L.C. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 799-801PubMed Google Scholar), which also belong to the class of two-component regulators, i.e. SpaR, the response regulator, and SpaK, the sensor histidine kinase(20Klein C. Kaletta C. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 296-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gutowski-Eckel Z. Klein C. Siegers K. Bohm K. Hammelmann M. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon disruption of either of these genes, subtilin production was abolished, indicating the involvement of these gene products in subtilin biosynthesis(20Klein C. Kaletta C. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 296-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation was shown to be growth-phase dependent, but an inducing signal was not identified(20Klein C. Kaletta C. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 296-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gutowski-Eckel Z. Klein C. Siegers K. Bohm K. Hammelmann M. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the structure and function of two-component regulators have been studied in great detail(14Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 16Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the nature of the inducing signal has remained unclear in many cases. It is demonstrated here that fully modified nisin can induce the transcription of its own structural gene as well as of the downstream genes by limited read-through, via signal transduction, by acting as the extracellular signal for the sensor histidine kinase NisK. L. lactis strains MG1614 (22Gasson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NZ9700 (a nisin-producing transconjugant containing Tn5276)(23Rauch P.J.G. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NZ9800 (a derivative of NZ9700 in which the nisA gene has been exchanged by replacement recombination with a modified nisA gene containing a 4-bp 1The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s). deletion in the pronisin-encoding part (ΔnisA) and which is therefore no longer able to produce nisin A) have been described previously(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). L. lactis strains were cultivated without aeration at 30°C in M17 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose (GM17) or sucrose (SM17). For L. lactis strains harboring pNZ273-derived plasmids(24Platteeuw C. Simons G. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 587-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), media were supplemented with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression plasmids pNZ9010 and pNZ9013(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 25Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. Yap W.M.G.J. Boot H.J. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol.

Rollema H.S. Yap W.M.G.J. Boot H.J. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24340-24346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a host strain for cloning experiments, Escherichia coli strain MC1061 (26Casadaban M.J. Chou J. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. base pair(s). The nisA promoter region including part of the nisA gene was isolated as a 1442-bp BglII-Ecl136II fragment from plasmid pNZ9000(8van der Meer J.R. Polman J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned into pNZ273, containing the promoterless gusA gene(24Platteeuw C. Simons G. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 587-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had been digested with BglII and ScaI, generating plasmid pNZ8003. Part of the upstream promoter region was deleted by digesting pNZ8003 with BglII and Tth111I. These sites were made blunt by Klenow polymerase and ligated, generating plasmid pNZ8008, which eventually contained a 312-bp nisA promoter fragment in front of the gusA gene. Another part of the nisA promoter region, including the full nisA gene and the first part of the nisB gene, was isolated as a 1904-bp BglII-MunI fragment from plasmid pNZ9000. This fragment was cloned into pNZ273(24Platteeuw C. Simons G. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 587-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had been digested with BglII and EcoRI, generating plasmid pNZ8002. A 1442-bp BglII-Ecl136II promoter fragment was deleted in pNZ8002, generating pNZΔ8002, by making the BglII site blunt with Klenow polymerase and subsequent ligation to the Ecl136II site. All constructs were initially made in E. coli MC1061(26Casadaban M.J. Chou J. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pNZ8008, pNZ8002, and pNZΔ8002 were used to transform L. lactis NZ9700 and L. lactis NZ9800(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and transformants were obtained by selecting for resistance to chloramphenicol. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or U. S. Biochemical Corp. and used as recommended by the manufacturers. The DNA sequence of the nisZ region was determined on the double-stranded plasmid DNA with the HindIII primer by the chain termination method(27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Transcription analyses of the nisA and ΔnisA genes were performed by isolation of RNA from L. lactis strains NZ9700 and NZ9800, Northern blotting, and subsequent hybridization with a radiolabeled nisA probe as described previously(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). RNA isolation was performed 2 h after induction of a culture with an A600 nm of 0.5. RNA (20 μg) was loaded in each lane, and the amounts were estimated by comparing the intensity of the 16 S and 23 S RNA bands. The chromosomal copy of the nisK gene was inactivated by introduction of an erythromycin resistance gene (28Horinouchi S. Weisblum B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 801-814Google Scholar) into the open reading frame of nisK. For this purpose, a 2.8-kilobase pair HindIII-EcoRI chromosomal DNA fragment from strain NZ9700 containing the 3′-part of the nisP gene and the intact nisR and nisK genes was cloned into pUC19. The erythromycin resistance gene was introduced into a unique SalI site, resulting in the interruption of the nisK open reading frame between the encoded amino acids 9 and 10 of NisK and leaving 1.1 and 1.7 kilobase pairs of flanking regions at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. This construct was designated pNZ9150. Strain NZ9800 was transformed with the nonreplicating plasmid pNZ9150, and integrants were selected on plates containing erythromycin (2.5 μg/ml). The selected integrants were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-CGGTCAATCTCGGAG-3′ and 5′-CGCTTTGTAATCATTTTCATC-3′ and by Southern hybridization using pUC19 DNA (29Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) as a probe. In one of the strains (NZ9850), the erythromycin resistance gene had been integrated via gene replacement at the 3′- and 5′-flanking regions, introducing this gene into the open reading frame of the chromosomal copy of the nisK gene, in the absence of any pUC19 sequences. The resulting construct was further analyzed by polymerase chain reaction of the nisK region and by Southern blotting using nisK as a probe to confirm the desired configuration. The nisB gene was disrupted by introducing a 162-bp in-frame deletion into the middle of the gene. This was accomplished by cloning a 4.4-kilobase pair BglII-EcoRI fragment, containing nisB and surrounding regions from the nisin gene cluster, into a BamHI-EcoRI-digested pUC19 vector, which harbored an additional erythromycin resistance marker, as has been described previously(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The deletion was made by removing an internal HpaI fragment from the nisB gene and subsequent ligation. The resulting plasmid was named pNZ9135 and was used for transformation of L. lactis NZ9700. Following transformation, erythromycin-resistant colonies were obtained that had integrated the plasmid by recombination of the plasmid with one of the flanking regions of the deleted fragment. After growing for 200 generations in the absence of erythromycin and plating, a colony was obtained that was sensitive to erythromycin. This had apparently been caused by a second recombination event involving the flanking region on the other side of the deletion than the side of the first recombination event, resulting in the replacement of nisB with ΔnisB on the chromosome. The configuration of the desired construct was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of the nisB region with the deletion and by Southern analysis of BglII-digested chromosomal DNA. The desired strain was called NZ9700 ΔnisB. Mutants of nisin Z were produced as described previously (25Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. Yap W.M.G.J. Boot H.J. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24340-24346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis of the nisZ gene were as follows: 5′-CAGGTGCATCACCACGCTGGACAAGTATTTCGCTATGTAC-3′ (I1W), 5′-CACCACGCATTTCAAGTATTTCGCTATG-3′ (T2S), 5′-CACCACGCATTACAACAATTTCGCTATGTACACCC-3′ (S3T),and 5′-AACAGGAGCTCTGTGGGGTTGTAACATG-3′ (M17W) (mutated nucleotides are indicated in boldface). All mutants were purified to homogeneity, and the structures of the modified residues were confirmed by one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR(25Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. Yap W.M.G.J. Boot H.J. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24340-24346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was established that T2S nisin Z contains a dehydroalanine residue at position 2, S3T nisin Z has a β-methyllanthionine ring between residues 3 and 7 instead of a lanthionine, and I1W nisin Z and M17W nisin Z contain a Trp residue at positions 1 and 17, respectively. Precursor nisin Z, containing the subtilin leader peptide (sl-nisin Z), was obtained as described before(30Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. de Vos W.M. Siezen R.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purified lacticin 481 was isolated as described previously(31Piard J.-C. Muriana P.M. Desmazeaud M.J. Klaenhammer T.R. Appl.

Preparations of subtilin (19Gross E. Kiltz H.H. Craig L.C. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 799-801PubMed Google Scholar) and lactococcin A (34Holo H. Nilssen Ø. Nes I.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3879-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) consisted of culture supernatants of producing strains, which were confirmed to possess substantial antimicrobial activity in agar diffusion assays. Antimicrobial activities against L. lactis MG1614 were determined essentially as described before for Micrococcus flavus(25Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. Yap W.M.G.J. Boot H.J. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24340-24346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L. lactis was cultured in GM17 broth at 30°C with an initial A600 nm of 0.025, and outgrowth was measured when the culture without nisin had reached an A600 nm of 0.8. Lactococcal cells (1 ml) were harvested at 1.5 h after induction with nisin (or mutants or fragments or other antimicrobial species) and adjusted in NaPi buffer (50 mM NaHPO4, pH 7.0) to a final A600 nm of 2.0. The cells were permeabilized by adding 50 μl of acetone/toluene (9:1) per ml of cells followed by 10 min of incubation at 37°C. The extracts were used immediately in the assay. For the determination of β-glucuronidase activity, 40 μl of extract was added to 950 μl of buffer (50 mM NaHPO4, pH 7.0, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and 10 μl of 100 mMp-nitro-β-D-glucuronic acid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The mixture was incubated, and the increase in A405 nm was measured at 37°C. Histochemical screening for gusA positive colonies was performed by including 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide (Research Organics Inc., Cleveland, OH) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM in GM17 plates(24Platteeuw C.

Shiba (Protein Research Foundation, Osaka, Japan). The promoter sequence and the transcription start site of nisA have been identified, and a transcript of ~260 nucleotides has been demonstrated in L. lactis strain NZ9700, which contains Tn5276(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). It has also been found that transcription of nisA is dependent on the integrity of nisA itself since a 4-bp deletion in the middle of the nisA gene (ΔnisA) on the chromosome of L. lactis strain NZ9800 completely abolishes transcription of this gene(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For further transcription analyses of the structural and biosynthetic genes, a series of isogenic lactococcal strains was used, including the nisin-producing NZ9700 and non-nisin-producing NZ9800 strains. Northern blotting showed that in strain NZ9800, the transcript of ΔnisA was absent, but after adding small amounts of nisin A to the culture medium at an A600 nm of 0.5, nisA transcripts appeared again (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the amount of these transcripts was dependent on the amount of nisin A added (Fig. 2, lanes 3-7). Several other related peptides were able to induce transcription, such as nisin Z and various nisin Z mutants, i.e. T2S nisin Z, S5T nisin Z(25Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. Yap W.M.G.J. Boot H.J. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24340-24346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), M17W nisin Z, S3T nisin Z, and sl-nisin Z, a fully modified nisin Z species that has the subtilin leader peptide still attached(30Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. de Vos W.M. Siezen R.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the last two species were >100-fold less effective inducers compared with nisin Z (data not shown). In contrast, the T2S and M17W nisin Z mutants were more potent inducers than nisin Z. These findings demonstrate that the modified lantibiotic part plays an important role in the induction process. Interestingly, several less related peptides evoked no restoration of transcription, i.e. the unmodified synthetic nisin A precursor of 57 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2, lane 12), the 56% homologous lantibiotic subtilin (19Gross E. Kiltz H.H. Craig L.C. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 799-801PubMed Google Scholar), the lantibiotic lacticin 481(31Piard J.-C. Muriana P.M. Desmazeaud M.J. Klaenhammer T.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 279-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Piard J.-C. Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S. Desmazeaud M.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16361-16368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the lantibiotic Pep5 (Fig. 2, lane 13)(33Sahl H.-G. Brandis H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 127: 377-383PubMed Google Scholar), and the antimicrobial peptide lactococcin A (34Holo H. Nilssen Ø. Nes I.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3879-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) (data not shown for subtilin, lacticin 481, and lactococcin A). To obtain a more quantitative assay of induction capacity and to investigate whether the nisA promoter could be used to regulate expression of heterologous genes in L. lactis, a nisin promoter fragment of 312 bp containing part of the nisA structural gene was fused to the promoterless reporter gene gusA of E. coli on plasmid pNZ273(24Platteeuw C. Simons G. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 587-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This construct, named pNZ8008, was used to transform strain NZ9800. The resulting strain was assayed for β-glucuronidase activity with and without induction by (mutant) nisins or other antimicrobial peptides. Without induction, β-glucuronidase activity could not be demonstrated, whereas wild-type nisin A and nisin Z effectively induced β-glucuronidase activity (Fig. 3). Moreover, the T2S and M17W nisin Z mutants were found to induce higher expression of gusA compared with wild-type nisin A and nisin Z, whereas the S3T and I1W nisin Z mutants were found to have lower induction capacity (Fig. 3). It was calculated that <5 molecules of the best inducer (T2S nisin Z) per cell are sufficient to activate transcription, which illustrates the high efficiency characteristic of signal transduction processes. Concordant with the transcription analyses, some of the antimicrobial peptides tested did not elicit induction of gusA expression (i.e. the unmodified synthetic nisin A precursor peptide, subtilin, lacticin 481, and lactococcin A). There is no direct relationship between antimicrobial activity of the nisin mutants against L. lactis strain MG1614 and their induction capacity (Table 1). The difference in potency can be attributed to the observation that antimicrobial activity is dependent on pore-forming activity in membranes(40Sahl H.-G Kordel M. Benz R. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Gao F.H. Abee T. Konings W.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 2164-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Sahl H.-G. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Nisin and Novel Lantibiotics. ESCOM Science Publishers B. V., Leiden, The Netherlands1991: 347-358Google Scholar), while induction capacity is likely to be dependent on interaction (directly or indirectly) with NisK.TABLE I Open table in a new tab In further experiments, the nisin-producing strain NZ9700 with either plasmid pNZ273 (containing the promoterless gusA gene) or pNZ8008 (containing the nisA promoter fragment followed by the gusA gene) was used in an agar diffusion assay (8van der Meer J.R. Polman J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the amount of nisin produced. Fifty times lower nisin production and severely reduced immunity were observed when plasmid pNZ8008 was present compared with the situation where pNZ273 was present. This can be explained by titration of the response regulator NisR by the multicopy presence of the nisA promoter region containing the putative NisR-binding site. More detailed insight into the minimal structural requirements of the inducer molecule was obtained by using synthetic nisin A fragments (35Wakamiya T. Ueki Y. Shiba T. Kido Y. Motoki Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 665-668Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Wakamiya T. Fukase K. Kitazawa M. Fujita H. Kubo A. Maeshiro Y. Shiba T. Rivier J. Marshall G. Peptides.

The minimal requirement for retaining induction capacity (2% induction of that of nisin A) was the presence of residues 1-11 of nisin A, comprising the first two rings. Addition of the third ring enhanced induction (8-30% induction), whereas a severe decrease in induction was caused by deleting the N-terminal residues Ile-1 and dehydrobutyrine 2 (0-1% induction) (Table 1). Fragments that contained rings B and C or rings D and E (for nomenclature of rings, see Fig. 1B) were not capable of acting as a signal effector. Thus, the most probable site of molecular interaction with the sensor protein NisK will be residues 1-11 of the nisin molecule. The sequence of the nisK gene located on Tn5276 has been reported (43de Vos W.M. Beerthuyzen M.M. Luesink E.J. Kuipers O.P. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1995; 85: 617-625PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to be identical to that of nisK from L. lactis 6F3(10Engelke G. Gutowski-Eckel Z. Kiesau P. Siegers K. Hammelmann M. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 814-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal nisK gene was insertionally inactivated by introduction of an erythromycin resistance gene (28Horinouchi S. Weisblum B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 801-814Google Scholar) into strain NZ9800, yielding strain NZ9850. As expected, transcription of ΔnisA was no longer inducible by any of the nisin species (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9). Nisin production in strain NZ9850 could not be restored by introduction of plasmid pNZ9010 (nisA) or pNZ9013 (nisZ), whereas it could be restored in strain NZ9800. Since the immunity level of strain NZ9850 is similar to that of strain MG1614 (0.01 μg of nisin A/ml), induction experiments were performed with amounts of nisin well below this level. Under these conditions, normal growth of the cells was observed. Strain NZ9850 was also transformed with pNZ8008, but after induction with 0.0005-0.0025 μg of nisin A/ml, no β-glucuronidase activity could be measured (<0.3 arbitrary unit), indicating at least 200 times lower expression than in strain NZ9800 containing pNZ8008, with the same inducer concentrations (Fig. 3). No polar effects of the nisK disruption on expression of the nisFEG genes downstream of nisK are expected since a promoter has been indicated in front of nisFEG(11Siegers K. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2P. G. G. A. de Ruyter, O. P. Kuipers, and W. M. de Vos, unpublished data. Moreover, the nisR and nisK genes have been integrated on the chromosome of strain MG1614 by replacement recombination, and the resulting strain was transformed by pNZ8008. In this strain, gusA expression was inducible by nisin species (data not shown), proving that only nisR and nisK are required for signal transduction. These results clearly demonstrate that NisK is essential in the signal transduction pathway and probably interacts directly with nisin itself. An in-frame deletion in the nisB gene of L. lactis strain NZ9700, made by replacement recombination, abolished nisin production as well as transcription of nisA, demonstrating that a hampered biosynthesis of nisin abolishes transcription of nisA. In this case, transcription of nisA could be restored by addition of nisin to the cells (Fig. 2, lane 11), probably because of the presence of intact nisR and nisK genes, which have their own promoter. The transcription start site of nisRK was mapped by primer extension and shown to be an A nucleotide 26 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of nisR (position 2117 in the nucleotide sequence published in (8van der Meer J.R. Polman J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). To probe the influence of a large inverted repeat sequence located in the intergenic region between ΔnisA and nisB on expression of genes downstream of ΔnisA (Fig. 1A), another plasmid was constructed (pNZ8002) in which the nisin promoter fragment including ΔnisA as well as the intergenic region and the first part of nisB was fused to the gusA gene. This plasmid was able to direct expression of gusA in strain NZ9800 only after induction with nisin species, albeit to an ~50-fold reduced level relative to gusA expression in pNZ8008 in strain NZ9800. When the nisin promoter fragment was removed from pNZ8002, yielding pNZΔ8002, β-glucuronidase activity was completely abolished, even in the presence of an inducer. These results show that expression of at least one downstream gene, i.e. nisB, is coregulated and is dependent on the presence of the nisA promoter. Most likely, expression of the other downstream genes nisTCIP limited read-through is also dependent on the nisA promoter since a significant increase in immunity levels, for which NisI is partially responsible(9Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), was found in the induced state relative to the uninduced state of strain NZ9800. Moreover, no apparent promoter sequences were found in front of any of the genes nisBTCIP. We have demonstrated that transcription of nisA is autoregulated, not intracellularly by its direct translation product, but extracellularly by the secreted and fully modified peptide via signal transduction by a two-component regulatory system.

Here, we have assessed the potential role of TAFs and the TFIID complex in directing basal promoter function. Reconstituted transcription reactions revealed the ability of TFIID versus TBP to discriminate between distinct core promoters. A comparison of different partial TBP-TAF assemblages established that a trimeric TBP-TAFII250-TAFII150 complex is minimally required for efficient utilization of the initiator and downstream promoter elements. Depending on the promoter structure, TAFs can increase or decrease the stability of TFIID-promoter interactions. These findings suggest that TAFs play a critical role in promoter selectivity and transcription regulation through direct contacts with core promoter elements."

To assess the contribution of either and both MPRs to the transport of lysosomal proteins, fibroblasts were established from mouse embryos that were homozygous for disrupted alleles of either MPR 46 or MPR 300 or both MPRs. Fibroblasts missing both MPRs secreted most of the newly synthesized lysosomal proteins and were unable to maintain the catabolic function of lysosomes. The intracellular levels of lysosomal proteins decreased to <20%, and undigested material accumulated in the lysosomal compartment. Fibroblasts lacking either MPR exhibited only a partial missorting and maintained, in general, half-normal to normal levels of lysosomal proteins. The same species of lysosomal proteins were found in secretions of double MPR-deficient fibroblasts as in secretions of single MPR-deficient fibroblasts, but at different ratios. This clearly indicates that neither MPR has an exclusive affinity for one or several lysosomal proteins. Furthermore, neither MPR can substitute in vivo for the loss of the other. It is proposed that the heterogeneity of the Man-6-P recognition marker within a lysosomal protein and among different lysosomal proteins has necessitated the evolution of two MPRs with complementary binding properties to ensure an efficient targeting of lysosomal proteins.

It is proposed that the heterogeneity of the Man-6-P recognition marker within a lysosomal protein and among different lysosomal proteins has necessitated the evolution of two MPRs with complementary binding properties to ensure an efficient targeting of lysosomal proteins. In mammalian cells, mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) 1The abbreviations used are: MPRsmannose 6-phosphate receptorsIGF-IIinsulin-like growth factor IIPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are essential elements of the transport system that ensure the targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes. Soluble lysosomal proteins become specifically modified with mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues during their passage through the Golgi apparatus and are targeted by MPRs to lysosomes (for review, see Kornfeld(1992) and Kornfeld and Mellman (1989)). The MPRs are type I transmembrane glycoproteins and have apparent molecular masses of 46,000 Da (MPR 46) (Hoflack and Kornfeld, 1985) and 300,000 Da (MPR 300) (Kornfeld, 1992). The extracytoplasmic domain of MPR 46 is homologous to each of the 15 repeating units that build the extracytoplasmic domain of MPR 300. MPR 300 is known to bind and endocytose additionally nonglycosylated insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). This property of MPR 300 is considered to be of importance for controlling the extracellular IGF-II level (Filson et al., 1993), while it is unclear whether MPR 300 has a function in transmembrane signal transduction analogous to other growth factor receptors (Okamoto et al., 1990; Körner et al., 1995). mannose 6-phosphate receptors insulin-like growth factor II polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The importance of MPRs for the biogenesis of lysosomes is illustrated by the phenotype of I-cell fibroblasts, which are unable to add Man-6-P recognition markers to their newly synthesized lysosomal proteins. As a result, excessive amounts of lysosomal proteins are secreted, and a marked intracellular deficiency of lysosomal enzymes and a defective lysosomal catabolism are observed (Nolan and Sly, 1989). As all mammalian cells analyzed express both MPRs, albeit at different levels and variable relative ratios (Wenk et al., 1991), it has been difficult to assess the role of each of the two MPRs in the biogenesis of lysosomes. Each of the two MPRs contributes to the intracellular retention of lysosomal proteins and their targeting to lysosomes as indicated by the accumulation of MPR ligands in the secretions of cells missing MPR 46 or MPR 300 (Gabel et al., 1983; Ludwig et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1994). It is, however, unclear whether the two MPRs transport the same or different lysosomal proteins or different subpopulations of a lysosomal protein, whether they feed distinct populations of target organelles with newly synthesized lysosomal proteins, and to what extent they can replace each other. Answers to these questions would be greatly facilitated if cells could be studied that lack both MPRs and that allow the expression of either or both of the receptors at various levels. In this study, we report on the generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack MPR 46 and MPR 300. Mice strains carrying disrupted MPR 46 or disrupted MPR 300 alleles were crossed to obtain offspring homozygous for each of the disrupted MPR alleles. As deficiency of MPR 300 leads to death before birth (Wang et al., 1994; Lau et al., 1994), fibroblasts were established from embryos at day 12.5. The phenotype of these fibroblasts was compared with that of fibroblasts from embryos lacking either of the two MPRs and with the phenotype of control fibroblasts. Compared with fibroblasts with a deficiency of one of the MPRs, the missorting of soluble lysosomal proteins was much more pronounced in double MPR-deficient fibroblasts. Analysis of individual lysosomal enzymes and of the Man-6-P polypeptides accumulating in secretions indicated that lysosomal proteins bind to both MPRs, although with different affinities. As a result, the two MPRs transport distinct complements of lysosomal proteins that consist of the same components, but at different ratios. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from day 12.5 embryos as described (Hogan et al., 1986) and grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal calf serum. Genomic DNA was prepared from fibroblast cultures derived from the embryos and digested and processed as described (Köster et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1994). Membrane fractions derived from 200 μg of total cellular protein were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis for MPR 300 and MPR 46 as described (Wenk et al., 1991). The blot was probed with rabbit antisera specific for the rat MPR 300 or MPR 46 cytoplasmic tail (Klumperman et al., 1993). For cathepsin D, 100 μg of total cellular protein were subjected to Western blotting and probed with a rabbit antiserum raised against cathepsin D purified from mouse liver and kidney. Blots were analyzed using an ECL light-based immunodetection system (Amersham Corp.). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured for 24 h on 35-mm Petri dishes in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum that was inactivated for lysosomal hydrolases (Ullrich et al., 1978). Cells and media were analyzed for the activity of lysosomal enzymes. Lysosomal acid phosphatase was measured as described using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (Gieselmann et al., 1984). Other lysosomal enzymes were detected using fluorometric assays as described (Köster et al., 1994). Fibroblasts on 35-mm Petri dishes were labeled for 2 h with 2.22 MBq of [35S]methionine and chased for 4 h. During the chase, the medium was supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml methionine. Immunoprecipitation was done from cells and media as described (Waheed et al., 1988). Cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated with an antiserum specific for mouse cathepsin D; β-glucuronidase was immunoprecipitated with an antiserum specific for mouse β-glucuronidase (kindly provided by R. Swank). Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by 0.5% saponin. Anti-mouse lamp-1 hybridoma supernatant 1D4B (HybridomaBank, University of Iowa) from rat was used as first antibody, and rhodamine-conjugated immunoglobulin was used as second antibody. Postnuclear supernatants from the cell homogenates on 100-mm Petri dishes were subjected to Percoll density centrifugation as described (Braun et al., 1989). After removal of Percoll by high speed centrifugation, the membrane layer above the pellet of Percoll was analyzed for the activity of lysosomal enzymes and immunoreactive cathepsin D. Cells (100-mm Petri dishes) were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Fixed cells were scraped with a rubber policeman in 1% formaldehyde, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and processed as described (Klumperman et al., 1993). lamp-1 was immunolocalized using monoclonal antibody 1D4B, and cathepsin D was immunolocalized with an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody. Areas exhibiting good ultrastructure were selected for determination of the relative frequency of gold particles. MPR 46 and MPR 300 were purified from human liver as described and coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad)according to the manufacturer's manual (Stein et al., 1987; von Figura et al., 1985). Media obtained after labeling were subjected to MPR affinity chromatography. The material precipitated with 0.5 g/ml ammonium sulfate was dialyzed overnight against buffer A (50 mM imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM EDTA). Media dialyzed against buffer A were incubated overnight with MPR-Affi-Gel 10 (end-over-end rotation) (0.2 mg of MPR 300/ml of gel and 5.6 mg of MPR 46/ml of gel). Then the material was washed with 6 × 2 ml of buffer A and with 3 × 1 ml of 5 mM glucose 6-phosphate and 3 × 1 ml of 5 mM mannose 6-phosphate in buffer A. The mannose 6-phosphate eluates were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid; pooled and dissolved in 50 μl of 0.4 M Tris; heated for 5 min at 95°C in 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1% SDS; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and fluorography. MPR 300+/- males were crossed with MPR 46-/- females. Double MPR heterozygous males of the offspring were mated with MPR 46-/- females to obtain MPR 46-/-/MPR 300+/- males and females, which were interbred. Embryos were prepared at day 12.5 of gestation. The fibroblast cultures established thereof were analyzed for their genotype and expression of MPRs. In Fig. 1, the genotype and Western blot analysis of embryonic fibroblasts homozygous for the targeted MPR 46 and MPR 300 alleles are shown and compared with control and fibroblasts homozygous for either of the two targeted MPR alleles. It is apparent that the MPR 46-/-/MPR 300-/- fibroblasts lack both MPR and that fibroblasts missing either type of MPR have a normal complement of the other MPR. Intracellular and extracellular activities of five soluble lysosomal enzymes known to be transported to lysosomes via MPRs (β-hexosaminidase, β-glucuronidase, α-fucosidase, β-mannosidase, and β-galactosidase) were measured after a 24-h culture period. As a control, the activity of a lysosomal enzyme known to be transported as an integral membrane protein independent of MPR (lysosomal acid phosphatase) was determined. In fibroblasts lacking both MPRs (MPR 46-/MPR 300-), the activities of the five soluble lysosomal enzymes were reduced to 7-21% of the control (Fig. 2). In single MPR-deficient fibroblasts, this decrease was less pronounced (39-81% in MPR 46- fibroblasts and 42-80% in MPR 300- fibroblasts). In each of the MPR-deficient fibroblast lines, the intracellular activity of acid phosphatase was in the range of controls (95-107%). For the five soluble lysosomal enzymes, the fraction of activity that accumulated in the secretions during a 24-h incubation period varied between 5 and 33% (expressed as percentage of enzyme activity in cells and medium). This fraction increased to 72-93% in MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts (Fig. 3). A deficiency of MPR 46 increased the fraction of enzyme in the secretions only to a minor extent (10-41%), while a deficiency of MPR 300 produced an intermediate level of accumulation (35-70%). Lysosomal acid phosphatase was not detectable in secretions of embryonic fibroblasts. In summary, these results suggest that lysosomal enzymes that are normally transported via a MPR-dependent mechanism are only poorly retained by MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts and are mostly released into the secretions. In single MPR-deficient fibroblasts, the missorting is less pronounced. It should be noted that the loss of either MPR 46 or MPR 300 produces a similar decrease in the intracellular level of the lysosomal enzymes tested, while the accumulation in their secretions is much more pronounced in MPR 300- fibroblasts. To determine the sorting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, fibroblasts were metabolically labeled in the presence of [35S]methionine for 2 h. Cells were then chased for 4 h to allow transport of labeled lysosomal enzymes to their final destination. Cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated from the cells and secretions. A minor fraction of the intracellular cathepsin D polypeptides was recovered as a 51-kDa precursor form. The bulk of 35S-labeled cathepsin D polypeptides was recovered as 38-45-kDa forms, which represent processing intermediates that can be further processed by endoproteolytic cleavage into a heavy (30 kDa) and a light (14-16 kDa) chain representing mature cathepsin D (Hasilik, 1992). In the secretions, only the precursor forms were detectable (Fig. 4). In controls, 20% of the labeled cathepsin D was recovered in the secretions and 80% intracellularly, while in MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts, the percentages were 96% and 5%, respectively. In secretions of MPR 46- and MPR 300- fibroblasts, 30 and 94%, respectively, of the newly synthesized cathepsin D were recovered. This clearly demonstrates that the bulk of newly synthesized cathepsin D is secreted in MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts, but also in MPR 300- fibroblasts. Moreover, in cells lacking MPR 300 alone or in combination with MPR 46, the relative level of newly synthesized cathepsin D was 2.3-2.4 higher than in control and MPR 46- fibroblasts. Parallel to cathepsin D, β-glucuronidase was immunoprecipitated from cells and media. β-Glucuronidase is synthesized and secreted as a 72-kDa precursor, while the intracellularly retained polypeptides are processed to a 69-kDa mature form. In MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts, 86% of the labeled β-glucuronidase was recovered in the secretions in contrast to 6% in controls. MPR 46- and MPR 300- fibroblasts accumulated in their secretions 10 and 69%, respectively, of the labeled β-glucuronidase (Fig. 4), indicating that missorting of β-glucuronidase and cathepsin D in MPR-deficient fibroblasts is similar. The deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme is generally associated with the storage of the material that is the substrate of this enzyme. This may lead to the enlargement of lysosomes and the development of a lysosomal storage disease. In fact, one of the light microscopic hallmarks of MPR 46-/MPR 300- cells distinguishing them from other cells was the presence of numerous phase-dense granular structures throughout their cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). Immunofluorescent staining for lamp-1, a transmembrane protein enriched in dense lysosomes, revealed that these granular structures are surrounded by lamp-1-positive membranes (Fig. 5B), thus characterizing them as lysosomes/endosomes. For comparison, the distribution and frequency of lamp-1-positive organelles in control fibroblasts are shown in Fig. 5C. The steady-state concentration of cathepsin D in MPR 46-/MPR 300- cells varied between 10 and 20% of controls as analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 6). In normal fibroblasts, the precursor and 30-kDa mature forms of cathepsin D are minor species, with the bulk (~85%) being represented by the 38-45-kDa intermediate forms. In double receptor-deficient fibroblasts, the intermediate forms appear to be ~15-20% of the precursor form, and the mature form is barely detectable. Furthermore, the intermediate form is ~2 kDa larger in size than in controls. This resembles findings in I-cell disease fibroblasts, in which the processed forms of cathepsin D are also ~2 kDa larger in size due to defective proteolytic processing at the carboxyl terminus (Hasilik, 1992). To determine the subcellular location of cathepsin D, the postnuclear supernatants of control and double receptor-deficient fibroblasts were subjected to Percoll density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 7). This separates dense membranes enriched in lysosomal markers (fraction 1) from more buoyant membranes enriched in markers for the Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and endosomes (fractions 4 and 5). In controls, ~60-70% of the lysosomal acid phosphatase and β-hexosaminidase was associated with the dense and 15-20% with the light membranes (Fig. 7, A and B). In MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts, the fraction of both lysosomal markers associated with dense membranes was reduced to 40-45%. In control fibroblasts, the dense membranes contained the bulk of cathepsin D (≥80%) and essentially all of the 30-kDa mature form. Similarly, in MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts, the dense membranes were enriched in proteolytically processed forms, while the light membranes were enriched in precursor forms. Thus, the residual amount of cathepsin D that is retained and proteolytically processed in double receptor-deficient fibroblasts appears to be associated with lysosomes. To obtain direct evidence for a lysosomal localization of cathepsin D in MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts, cryosections were double-immunolabeled for lamp-1 and cathepsin D (Fig. 8). In control fibroblasts, the majority of cathepsin D (small gold) and lamp-1 (large gold) label was associated with lysosomal profiles that were filled with rather homogeneous electron-dense material and multiple membranes. Profiles containing only one type of label were rarely seen (Fig. 8A). This was also true for MPR 46-/MPR 300- cells, in which two types of structures contained the bulk of the label (Fig. 8B). One type resembled the lysosomal profiles seen in controls, while the other type was represented by large multivesicular structures filled with floccular electron-dense material. Occasionally, mitochondria were detectable inside these structures, suggesting an autophagic origin. Striking differences were found for the relative intensities of cathepsin D and lamp-1 labeling in the various structures (Table 1). In the lysosome-like structures of controls, labeling for lamp-1 was ~3 times higher than for cathepsin D. In the autophagosome-like multivesicular structures of MPR 46-/MPR 300- cells, labeling for lamp-1 was 6 times higher, while in the lysosome-like structures, labeling for cathepsin D was ~6 times higher. Surprisingly, the intensity of cathepsin D labeling seen in MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts did not reflect the 5-10 times lower content of cathepsin D compared with controls. Irrespective of the unexplained labeling intensities, these results provide clear evidence that a small fraction of cathepsin D is targeted to lysosomes in fibroblasts lacking MPR.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The pattern of MPR ligands recovered in secretions of MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts is likely to reflect the pattern of Man-6-P-containing polypeptides synthesized by the cells. Secretions from controls or cells that are missing one of the two MPRs are depleted of those Man-6-P-containing polypeptides that have undergone MPR-dependent sorting. The unique property of MPR 46-/MPR 300- secretions in representing an unbiased collection of MPR ligands allows us to test whether Man-6-P polypeptides have different affinities for MPR 46 and MPR 300. For this purpose, secretions of metabolically labeled MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts were passed over Affi-Gel 10 columns to which human MPR 46 or MPR 300 had been coupled. After extensive washing, bound ligands were eluted with Man-6-P and characterized by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Since the two MPRs were reported to have a distinct pH dependence of binding above pH 6.5 (Hoflack et al., 1987; Distler et al., 1991), we examined the binding over a pH range of 5.4-7.4 (Fig. 9). Three aspects became apparent. First, the pH profile for the overall binding of Man-6-P polypeptides showed for both receptors an optimal binding between pH 6.2 and 6.6. Rechromatography of the material unbound at pH 6.6 revealed that >85% of the ligands had bound to either column during the first run. Second, the pattern of polypeptides bound to the MPR 46 or MPR 300 affinity column differed, and the differences were observed over the whole pH range tested. Receptor ligands with a pH optimum for binding below pH 6.2 or above pH 6.6 were not apparent. Third, none of the Man-6-P polypeptides bound exclusively to one type of MPR. Taken together, these data indicate that the Man-6-P polypeptides differ in their affinity for the two MPRs, but not to a degree that would prevent binding to either of the two MPRs. Due to the differential affinities of Man-6-P polypeptides for either type of MPR, it was expected that their pattern would be different in secretions from either MPR 46- or MPR 300- fibroblasts. Secretions of MPR 46- cells were expected to be enriched in Man-6-P polypeptides that bind preferentially to MPR 46, and conversely, secretions of MPR 300- cells in those that bind preferentially to MPR 300. The results shown in Fig. 10 demonstrate that this prediction was met only in part. While the frequency of Man-6-P polypeptides that bound to the receptor columns increased from ~1% in controls to 3-4.5% in single MPR-deficient fibroblasts to up to 7-8% in MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts, secretions from single MPR-deficient fibroblasts contained Man-6-P polypeptides that bound almost equally well to either type of receptor column. Only few receptor ligands were markedly enriched in secretions of either MPR 46- or MPR 300- fibroblasts, e.g. secretions of MPR 46- cells were enriched in a 43-kDa polypeptide. Conversely, a 68-kDa polypeptide was enriched in secretions of MPR 300- cells. The 43- and 68-kDa polypeptides, however, apparently bound equally well to the MPR 46 and MPR 300 affinity columns (see Fig. 10). As predicted for the deficiency of both MPRs, the 43- and 68-kDa polypeptides were also present in secretions from MPR 46-/MPR 300- cells. It should be noted that the binding of Man-6-P polypeptides to MPR affinity columns might significantly differ from the binding to MPRs in vivo. This is indicated by the observation that of the cathepsin D polypeptides present in secretions of MPR 46-/MPR 300- cells, only 26% were bound to the MPR 46 affinity column and only 14% to the MPR 300 affinity column (data not shown). In vivo, the bulk of cathepsin D is retained intracellularly as long as MPR 300 is expressed, indicating efficient binding to MPR 300 (see Fig. 4). Thus, the pattern of ligands identified by the affinity column approach may significantly differ from the pattern of ligands that bind in vivo to the MPRs in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network compartment. In I-cell disease, the deficiency of N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase, the key enzyme required for the synthesis of Man-6-P residues on soluble lysosomal enzymes, is responsible for the lack of Man-6-P recognition markers on lysosomal proteins. As a result, the bulk of newly synthesized soluble lysosomal proteins is secreted. In I-cell fibroblasts, the excessive secretion leads to a marked intracellular deficiency of soluble lysosomal proteins, which results in defective lysosomal catabolism and storage of undigested material. Upon light microscopic examination, the enlarged lysosomes filled with storage material appear as phase-dense inclusions, from where I-cell disease (I = inclusion) acquired its name (for review, see Nolan and Sly(1989)). The deficiency of MPRs was predicted to result in a similar missorting of soluble lysosomal proteins and lysosomal dysfunction as the deficiency of Man-6-P recognition markers in I-cell disease. In fact, a comparison of I-cell fibroblasts and MPR 46-/MPR 300- fibroblasts shows that this prediction is met. In both cell types, the bulk of newly synthesized soluble lysosomal proteins is secreted. Intracellularly, a profound deficiency of these proteins is found, and the lysosomal compartment is enlarged due to storage material. These observations underline the critical function of MPRs for targeting of soluble lysosomal proteins. A similar conclusion was reached in a recent study related to the present one, in which MPR-deficient fibroblasts were studied that were obtained by mating MPR 46-deficient and Thp mice (Ludwig et al., 1994). Thp mice carry a deletion on chromosome 17 that includes the locus of MPR 300. Since the MPR 300 gene is imprinted in mice and only expressed from the maternal chromosome (Wang et al., 1994), the maternal inheritance of a Thp allele results in a deficiency of MPR 300. For cathepsin D and β-glucuronidase, the fraction of newly synthesized polypeptides retained in MPR-deficient fibroblasts was 4 and 14%, respectively. This was sufficient to maintain, for both enzymes, steady-state concentrations of ~20% of that in controls. Several mechanisms may help to maintain steady-state concentrations that are higher than expected from the residual targeting, e.g. the half-life of lysosomal proteins may be prolonged in MPR-deficient fibroblasts due to the deficiency of lysosomal proteinases. For cathepsin D, a 2-3-fold higher rate of synthesis appears to contribute to the higher residual steady-state concentration. This increase in synthesis correlated with the deficiency of MPR 300. It will be of interest to see whether expression of MPR 300 in these cells will restore the rate of synthesis of cathepsin D to a normal level. Biochemical and morphological data demonstrated that the cathepsin D retained in MPR-deficient cells was associated with lysosome-like structures. This raises the question by which mechanism the residual amount of lysosomal proteins found in lysosomes of MPR-deficient fibroblasts is transported to lysosomes. Signal receptor-dependent and signal receptor-independent (default) pathways, such as missorting at the trans-Golgi network, fluid-phase endocytosis, or cell-cell contact-mediated transfer of lysosomal proteins, may account for this residual targeting. The amount of Man-6-P ligands in secretions from MPR-deficient fibroblasts was about twice as high as in single MPR-deficient fibroblasts. Surprisingly, all Man-6-P polypeptides that were detectable in secretions of MPR-deficient fibroblasts were also found in secretions of MPR 46- and/or MPR 300- fibroblasts. This clearly indicates that at the normal level of MPR expression, neither MPR 46 nor MPR 300 can substitute for the other MPR with respect to the targeting of lysosomal proteins. As a result, each of the Man-6-P polypeptides is found in the secretions of both single MPR-deficient fibroblasts. Support for transport of distinct complements of lysosomal proteins by the two MPRs came from the comparison of the Man-6-P polypeptides accumulating in secretions of MPR 46- and MPR 300- fibroblasts. Man-6-P polypeptides preferentially accumulating in secretions of MPR 46- or MPR 300- fibroblasts were identifiable. This clearly demonstrates that the two MPRs have distinct affinities for Man-6-P polypeptides, which, in vivo and in vitro, results in the binding of a different pattern of lysosomal proteins. This was also supported by the distinct effect that loss of either MPR had on the sorting of cathepsin D and β-glucuronidase. It should be noted, however, that we failed to identify lysosomal proteins that bound in vitro or in vivo exclusively to either type of MPR. The data presented here, as well as analogous observations in MPR-deficient fibroblasts due to the disruption of MPR 46 alleles and maternal inheritance of the Thp allele (Ludwig et al., 1994), demonstrate that in vivo the two receptors are responsible for the transport of two sets of ligands that are distinctly composed, but made up of the same lysosomal proteins. Due to the overlapping affinities, it is conceivable that the two MPRs could substitute for each other with regard to their targeting function for lysosomal proteins provided that their expression level is high enough. There is already experimental evidence that overexpression of MPR 46 cannot compensate for the targeting function of MPR 300. In cells with undetectable levels of MPR 300, overexpression of MPR 46 led only to a partial correction of the missorting, while expression of MPR 300 in these cells fully corrected the missorting (Watanabe et al., 1990; Johnson and Kornfeld, 1992). This can be explained by the observation that part of the ligands that are bound by MPR 46 are secreted rather than targeted to lysosomes (Chao et al., 1990). Thus, the two receptors bind different complements of lysosomal enzymes and deliver them to sites that are different in part. Whether overexpression of MPR 300 can compensate for the loss of MPR 46 needs to be investigated. If the two MPRs transport the same lysosomal proteins, although at different ratios, what parameter determines whether a lysosomal protein binds to MPR 46 or MPR 300? Available evidence suggests that lysosomal proteins encounter and bind to MPR 46 and MPR 300 in the trans-Golgi network (Klumperman et al., 1993). If so, structural differences in the Man-6-P recognition markers on lysosomal proteins must account for the binding of distinct complements of lysosomal proteins to the two MPRs. The Man-6-P recognition markers in lysosomal proteins indeed display a high structural heterogeneity. The number of phosphate groups in a high mannose oligosaccharide can vary (up to two), as well as the position of the phosphorylated mannose residues (five different positions) and the extent to which the phosphate groups persist in their biosynthetic precursor form as diesters (for review, see von Figura and Hasilik(1986)). Earlier studies have shown that the affinities of the two MPRs for high mannose oligosaccharides containing two phosphomonoester or phosphodiester groups differ significantly (Hoflack et al., 1987; Tong and Kornfeld, 1989). Thus, the heterogeneity of Man-6-P recognition markers in combination with the inability of a single type of MPR to bind all the Man-6-P polypeptides with sufficient affinity to ensure their retention and targeting may have been one of the reasons that necessitated the evolution of two types of MPR. Theoretically, a higher efficiency of targeting may have also been obtained by adopting the N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase to yield products of higher homogeneity and yet sufficient affinity for a single type of MPR. The N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase, which is the key enzyme for the synthesis of Man-6-P recognition markers, has two recognition sites. Current models propose that one recognition site of the phosphotransferase interacts with an extended surface area of a lysosomal protein. The other recognition site then has to interact with oligosaccharides at multiple sites at the surface of a lysosomal protein on which the N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate residue is transferred (Cantor et al., 1992; Cantor and Kornfeld, 1992). It is conceivable that evolutionary pressure has focused on establishing the specificity of the N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase for the heterogenous group of lysosomal proteins at the expense of the homogeneity of the Man-6-P recognition marker. After having established two types of MPRs with complementary affinities for the diverse Man-6-P recognition markers, the two MPRs may have adopted additional functions, be it the endocytosis of Man-6-P ligands or the binding of IGF-II, both of which are characteristic of MPR 300. The acquisition of IGF-II binding appears to have been a fairly recent event in evolution since MPR 300 from chicken or frog fails to bind IGF-II (Canfield and Kornfeld, 1989; Clairmont and Czech, 1989). Taken together, the studies on the single and double MPR-deficient fibroblasts led to the proposal that the heterogeneity of Man-6-P recognition markers necessitated more than one type of MPR to ensure efficient retention and targeting of the multiple forms of soluble lysosomal proteins. The heterogeneity of the Man-6-P markers may in turn have been the result of compromising the needs for distinguishing lysosomal from nonlysosomal glycoproteins by the N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase and yet allowing phosphorylation of variably located oligosaccharides.

https://openalex.org/W1985649033,"The major mycolic acid produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains two cis-cyclopropanes in the meromycolate chain. The gene whose product cyclopropanates the proximal double bond was cloned by homology to a putative cyclopropane synthase identified from the Mycobacterium leprae genome sequencing project. This gene, named cma2, was sequenced and found to be 52% identical to cma1 (which cyclopropanates the distal double bond) and 73% identical to the gene from M. leprae. Both cma genes were found to be restricted in distribution to pathogenic species of mycobacteria. Expression of cma2 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in the cyclopropanation of the proximal double bond in the α1 series of mycolic acids. Coexpression of both cyclopropane synthases resulted in cyclopropanation of both centers, producing a molecule structurally similar to the M. tuberculosis α-dicyclopropyl mycolates. Differential scanning calorimetry of purified cell walls and mycolic acids demonstrated that cyclopropanation of the proximal position raised the observed transition temperature by 3°C. These results suggest that cyclopropanation contributes to the structural integrity of the cell wall complex.

This gene, named cma2, was sequenced and found to be 52% identical to cma1 (which cyclopropanates the distal double bond) and 73% identical to the gene from M. leprae. Both cma genes were found to be restricted in distribution to pathogenic species of mycobacteria. Expression of cma2 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in the cyclopropanation of the proximal double bond in the α1 series of mycolic acids. Coexpression of both cyclopropane synthases resulted in cyclopropanation of both centers, producing a molecule structurally similar to the M. tuberculosis α-dicyclopropyl mycolates. Differential scanning calorimetry of purified cell walls and mycolic acids demonstrated that cyclopropanation of the proximal position raised the observed transition temperature by 3°C. These results suggest that cyclopropanation contributes to the structural integrity of the cell wall complex."

https://openalex.org/W1509642235,"Although extremely low frequency (ELF, < 300 Hz) magnetic fields exert a variety of biological effects, the magnetic field sensing/transduction mechanism (or mechanisms) remain to be identified. Using the well-defined inhibitory effects that magnetic fields have on opioid peptide mediated antinociception or ""analgesia"" in the land snail Cepaea nemoralis, we show that these actions only occur for certain frequency and amplitude combinations of time-varying sinusoidal magnetic fields in a manner consistent with a direct influence of these fields. We exposed snails with augmented opioid activity to ELF magnetic fields, which were varied in both amplitude and frequency, along with a parallel static magnetic field. When the peak amplitude (0-547 microT) of a magnetic field of 60 Hz was varied systematically, we observed a nonlinear response, i.e., a nonlinear reduction in analgesia as measured by the latency of a defined response by the snails to a thermal stimulus. When frequency (10-240 Hz) was varied, keeping the amplitude constant (141 microT), we saw significant inhibitory effects between 30 and 35 Hz, 60 and 90 Hz and at 120 and 240 Hz. Finally, when the static field was varied but the amplitude and frequency of the time-varying field were held constant, we observed significant inhibition at almost all amplitudes. This amplitude/frequency ""resonance-like"" dependence of the magnetic field effects suggests that the mechanism (or mechanisms) of response to weak ELF fields likely involves a direct magnetic field detection mechanism rather than an induced current phenomenon. We examined the implications of our findings for several models proposed for the direct sensing of ELF magnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W2143022342,"Telomerase activity was demonstrated in cell-free extracts from S. cerevisiae through the use of a PCR-based assay. As expected, this activity was eliminated by RNase or phenol treatment of the extract and was dependent on dGTP and dTTP. Telomerase was not detected in extracts prepared from cells grown for approximately 30 or more cell divisions in the absence of the EST1 product, Est1p. TLC1 RNA, which determines the sequence of telomeric DNA in vivo, was present in normal amounts in est1 delta cells. Moreover, TLC1 RNA specifically precipitated with epitope-tagged Est1p. These data indicate that Est1p is either a subunit of yeast telomerase or an accessory protein associated with telomerase that is essential in vitro for its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1980527941,"Most mitochondrial precursor proteins are processed to the mature form in one step by mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), while a subset of precursors destined for the matrix or the inner membrane are cleaved sequentially by MPP and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP). We showed previously that yeast MIP (YMIP) is required for mitochondrial function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To further define the role played by two-step processing in mitochondrial biogenesis, we have now characterized the natural substrates of YMIP. A total of 133 known yeast mitochondrial precursors were collected from the literature and analyzed for the presence of the motif RX(decreases)(F/L/I)XX(T/S/G)XXXX(decreases), typical of precursors cleaved by MPP and MIP. We found characteristic MIP cleavage sites in two distinct sets of proteins: respiratory components, including subunits of the electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, and components of the mitochondrial genetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and proteins required for mitochondrial DNA metabolism. Representative precursors from both sets were cleaved to predominantly mature form by mitochondrial matrix or intact mitochondria from wild-type yeast. In contrast, intermediate-size forms were accumulated upon incubation of the precursors with matrix from mip1 delta yeast or intact mitochondria from mip1ts yeast, indicating that YMIP is necessary for maturation of these proteins. Consistent with the fact that some of these substrates are essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial protein synthesis and mitochondrial DNA replication, mip1 delta yeast undergoes loss of functional mitochondrial genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2085905344,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) binds to ribosomes that synthesize nascent chains bearing signal sequences and catalyzes their targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In S. cerevisiae, a temperature-sensitive mutation in the SEC65 gene, encoding an SRP subunit, results in lowered levels of SRP. Growth and protein translocation defects induced by this mutation can be suppressed specifically by sublethal doses of cycloheximide but not anisomycin, each inhibitors of different steps of translation elongation. Cycloheximide also suppresses protein translocation defects caused by depletion of a different SRP subunit. We propose that reduced elongation rates in the presence of cycloheximide allow otherwise insufficient SRP to interact efficiently with ribosomes. These results are consistent with a sampling model in which SRP cycles on and off of translating ribosomes at specific steps during the elongation cycle to inspect all nascent chains for the presence of signal sequences."

This term is correctly applied only to rhythms that have been proven to be endogenously generated. Such rhythms persist in constant darkness and are usually entrained to the environmental lighting cycle by light/dark cues. Circadian rhythms endow organisms with the ability to anticipate daily changes in the environment. changes in mammalian pineal function are driven by norepinephrine (NE),2 which is released from terminals in the gland in response to signals originating in the master circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN; Refs. 1 and 2). NE acts through [Ca2+]i and cyclic AMP to control pineal function(3Sugden L.A. Sugden D. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 741-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Vanecek J.

In the study presented here, we extended studies on Fos-related proteins in the pineal gland and have found that expression of Fra-2 is physiologically regulated on a circadian basis and that regulation appears to involve an adrenergic → cyclic AMP mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Organ CultureMale Sprague-Dawley rats (~6 weeks old; weighing 200-250 g) were purchased from Zivic-Miller Laboratories (Allison Park, PA) and were housed in 14:10 light/dark lighting conditions (lights on at clock time 5 h, unless stated otherwise) for 7 days before use. Animals were anesthetized by CO2 inhalation and immediately decapitated. Pineal glands were rapidly removed and either quick-frozen in a 1.5-ml microtube in solid CO2 or placed in organ culture. Cultured glands were incubated (37°C; 95% O2, 5% CO2) in chemically defined culture medium (BGJb (Life Technologies, Inc.); 2 glands/well, 200 μl/well) in a 24-multiwell plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 48 h prior to treatment. The medium was changed every 24 h. After 48 h, each gland was placed in fresh medium for 1 h and then the indicated drug was added. After treatment, glands were removed, placed in a 1.5-ml microtube in solid CO2 and stored (-70°C).Gel Mobility Shift AssayGlands that had been quick-frozen on dry ice (2/microtube) were homogenized in a 30-μl sample of ice-cold buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.42 M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 5 μM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 25% glycerol) with a tight-fitting pestle (20 strokes). Homogenates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 10 s) vortexed, refrozen on dry ice for 5 min, incubated in ice water for 15 min, and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C). This procedure extracted 40-50 μg of soluble protein/pineal gland (Bio-Rad protein assay). Gel mobility shift assays were done using a 32P-radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus (boldface) AP-1 binding element (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) and 3 μl of total extract(27Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).Western Blot and V8 Peptide AnalysisExtracts were electrophoresed on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The following anti-peptide sera were used: anti-c-Fos129-153, a rabbit affinity purified anti-c-Fos129-153 serum (F2P1; (28Quinn J.P. Takimoto M. Iadarola M. Holbrook N. Levens D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); generously provided by M. Iadarola, NIH); anti-c-Fos3-16, a rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal anti-human c-Fos3-16 (SC-52, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-c-Fos128-152, a mouse monoclonal anti-human c-Fos128-152 serum (Ab-1 PC06, Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Densitometric analysis of the Western blot data was performed with the Quantity ONE™ software package (Protein Database Inc., Huntington Station, NY) on a Sun Sparc workstation (Sun Microsystems, Inc. Mountain View, CA). Blots were stripped for reprobing by incubation in 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (70°C; 60 min).For Cleveland analysis (V8), immunoprecipitated Fra-42/46 and in vitro translated Fra-2 were first resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gel). Fra-containing bands were excised and placed in the wells of a second 18% PAGE gel. Proteins were treated with V8 protease (0.5-5000 ng/lane, 30 min) in the stacking gel(29Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partial proteolytic products were detected using anti-c-Fos129-153 antiserum and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Metabolic LabelingFor metabolic labeling studies, pineal glands were incubated for 48 h and then transferred to phosphate-free BGJb. Thirty minutes later 32P-labeled NaO3PO4 (2 mCi/ml, specific activity 1 Ci/mmol) was added together with the indicated drugs. Glands were incubated (3-5 h; 37°C), rinsed and quick-frozen on solid CO2. For immunoprecipitation, groups of 6 frozen glands were sonicated for 10 s in 180 μl of RIPA (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS); the resulting homogenates were incubated (10 min, 4°C) and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C). The clear supernatants were incubated with 4 μl of anti c-Fos129-153 antiserum. Immune complexes were collected on RIPA-washed Protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) and washed seven times with ice-cold RIPA; to prepare the samples for analysis, a 100-μl volume of Laemmli buffer (30Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) was added to the Protein A-agarose beads and the mixture was boiled for 10 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gel), transferred to blotting membrane, and detected by autoradiography and anti-c-Fos129-153 immunoblotting.RNA AnalysisNorthern blots (Hybond-N, Amersham) containing 15 μg/lane of total pineal RNA were prepared. The probes were: a randomly labeled PCR product generated by amplifying fra-2 sequences between nucleotides 459 and 981 (Fig. 3A); a full-length cDNA fragment derived from a RAT-c-fos construct, pG-fos (generously provided by M. Iadarola), as a derivative of SP65-c-fos(31Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar); and a full-length cDNA fragment derived from a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). After autoradiography, the blots were stripped by two brief washes in 0.1% SDS in distilled water (97°C).For the RNase protection assays, pCRII/ARF2 (antisense version of pCRIIFRA+) was linearized with AccI or BamHI to generate partial or full riboprobes. T7 polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for transcription in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (Amersham; 800 Ci/mmol) and products were gel-purified. After hybridization (18 h, 45°C) with 10 μg of total pineal RNA, RNA:RNA hybrids were digested for 1 h with a mixture of RNase A + T1 (Boehringer Mannheim). Protected fragments were resolved using a denaturing PAGE (6% urea gel) and visualized in a PhosphorImager.Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)Total RNA was extracted using Trysol (Life Technologies, Inc.). One μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis (avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Promega) in the presence of random hexamers (Pharmacia). The primers used were APEP (5′-ATGTICCAGGAITATCCCGGG-3′) and QPEP (5′-CAGAGCCAGCAGAGTGGG-3′); the incubation was for 30 cycles (denaturation at 94°C, annealing at 60°C, and extension at 72°C, each for 1 min). RT-PCR products were resolved using a Novex gel system (Novex, San Diego, CA). The 980-bp product was subcloned into pCRII and pCR3 vectors (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced using the dideoxy-chain termination method (Sequenase, United States Biochemical Corp.) Clones with inserts in the sense orientation relative to the T7 or cytomegalovirus promoters were isolated and referred to as pCRII/FRA+ and pCR3/FRA, respectively. For transfection studies DNA was purified using the Nucleobond AX kit (Macherey-Nagel-Duren, Switzerland).Transfections and in Vitro TranslationCos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were done routinely using 0.2 × 106 Cos-7 cells that had been plated for 18 h; cells were overlaid with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 1 μg of DNA previously mixed with 9 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free DMEM. For Western blot analysis of cellular proteins, cells were harvested 40 h post-transfection. For the cell-free synthesis of Fra-2 protein, transcription and translation reactions were done with T7 polymerase and unsupplemented rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega), respectively, following the manufacturer's recommendations.StatisticsData are presented as the mean of the results of analysis of at least two pools (2-4 glands/pool). When quantitation is presented, experiments were carried out at least four times with essentially identical results. Qualitative data are representative of at least two independent experiments, the results of which were fundamentally similar.RESULTS3A 42/46-kDa Fra Is under Circadian Regulation in the Rat Pineal GlandThis study was started by monitoring the daily pattern of expression of pineal Fra's through a light/dark cycle of 14:10 h (Fig. 1A). Several c-Fos antisera were used. One, termed anti-c-Fos129-153, is similar to the serum used in cytochemical reports(11Koistanaho J. Yang G. Histochemistry. 1990; 95: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); it detects a peptide sequence found in c-Fos and related proteins(28Quinn J.P. Takimoto M. Iadarola M. Holbrook N. Levens D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reagent revealed a dramatic nocturnal increase in a 42-46-kDa Fra (Fra-42/46) and in a 35-kDa Fra (Fra-35), but failed to detect c-Fos in this tissue. 4R. Baler and D. C. Klein, unpublished results. These observations confirm cytochemical reports of a nocturnal increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity in the pineal gland(11Koistanaho J. Yang G. Histochemistry. 1990; 95: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and indicate this is associated with an increase in Fra-42/46.Figure 1:Circadian rhythm and photoneural regulation of pineal Fra proteins. Animals were sacrificed at the indicated time of the day. Glands were removed and rapidly frozen on solid CO2. Horizontal bars in A and B represent lighting (light, open bar; dark, shaded bar). A, proteins in whole pineal extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-c-Fos129-153 antiserum (top panel). The second antiserum was horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. The blot was stripped and re-exposed to an anti-c-Fos3-16 antiserum (second from top panel), and processed as above. Each lane represents a pool of two glands. The third panel is a densitometric quantitation of Western blot data (solid circles, Fra-42/46; open circles, c-Fos). The fourth panel presents NAT activity in the extracts(46Sugden D.

B, analysis of pineal glands from animals housed in a 14:10 light/dark lighting cycle (L:D) or in constant darkness for 4 days (D:D). Pineal extracts were analyzed (from top to bottom) for anti-c-Fos129-153 and anti-c-Fos3-16 immunoreactivities, AP-1 DNA binding activity (free probe is not shown), and NAT activity (open circles). C, effect of continuous light exposure at night and SCGX on Fra-42/46. Groups of 4 pineal glands were harvested at the indicated time of day, and whole pineal protein extracts were analyzed by anti-c-Fos129-153 immunoblotting. Animals were exposed to darkness (L→D) or to light (L→L) at night. Animals that had been SCGXed 2 weeks earlier were housed in a 14:10 light/dark lighting cycle (L→D). One group of SCGX animals was injected with ISO (1 mg/kg) 4 h before death. In these and following figures, the migration of prestained protein molecular size standards (Amersham Corp.) is indicated on the right of each blot (kDa). Further technical details are given under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The second serum used, anti-c-Fos3-16, detects c-Fos at lower levels and in a selective manner. It failed to detect Fra-42/46, but detected c-Fos (62 kDa) at relatively constant levels at all times of the day; this was confirmed using a mouse monoclonal anti-c-Fos128-152.4 These observations indicate that changes in c-Fos do not seem to contribute to the increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity seen in cytochemical studies(11Koistanaho J. Yang G. Histochemistry. 1990; 95: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).To obtain an independent indication of the pineal function, NAT enzyme activity was also measured in the same protein extracts. NAT activity increased at night in parallel with the increase in Fra-42/46 (Fig. 1A, bottom panel).To determine if the increase in Fra-42/46 was circadian in nature, as is true of the increase in NAT activity, both were measured during a 24-h period after animals had been housed for 4 days in constant darkness (dark/dark) (Fig. 1B). Fra-42/46 increased during the subjective night, the period that corresponds to the night period of the preceding 14:10 lighting cycle. The increase in Fra-42/46 under these circumstances is clear evidence that the day/night rhythm in Fra-42/46 is truly circadian.It is likely that the circadian rhythm in Fra-42/46 is generated by the SCN oscillator, because the increase in Fra-42/46 was blocked by two treatments which block SCN → pineal stimulation, i.e. continuous light at night (L→L) or superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGX, Fig. 1C). The lack of an increase in Fra-42/46 did not reflect tissue refractoriness because it was possible to increase Fra-42/46 in SCGX or in L→L animals by treatment with the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonist isoproterenol (ISO; Fig. 1C and data not shown).The robust circadian increase in Fra-42/46 parallels an equally robust increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 1B; (32Carter D.A. Neuroscience. 1995; 62: 1267-1278Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar)).Fra-42/46 Expression Is Regulated by a β-AR→Cyclic AMP MechanismOrgan culture was used to study first and second messenger regulation of Fra-42/46 expression (Fig. 2). NE treatment increased Fra-42/46 expression (Fig. 2A). The largest increase was seen with 0.1 μM NE; distinctly smaller responses were obtained at both higher and lower concentrations. The peak response occurred at 6 h, which is similar to the time course of the responses of other Fra proteins (33Sonnenberg J.L. McGregor-Leon P.F. Curran T. Morgan J.L.

Anti-c-Fos129-153 immunoblotting analysis of whole protein extracts from pineal glands (2 glands/lane) that were treated with PE (0.1 μM), ISO (0.1 μM), NE (0.1 μM), or Bt2cAMP (1 mM) for 6 h. Treatment with 5 μM prazosin, 5 μM propranolol, cycloheximide (CHX, 60 μg/ml), or actinomycin D (ActD, 50 μg/ml) was started 30 min before stimulation. C, phosphatase treatment affects the migration of Fra-42/46. Five μl of a pineal nuclear extract prepared from NE-stimulated glands (0.1 μM, 6 h) essentially as described(47Baler R. Dahal G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), were treated with the indicated amount of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) at 37°C for 20 min or left untreated on ice and subjected to anti-c-Fos129-153 immunoblotting. D, Fra-42/46 is a phosphoprotein. Pineal glands in culture were stimulated with either NE (10 μM, 3 h) or Bt2cAMP (1 mM, 6 h) during incubation with 32P-labeled NaO3PO4 (2 mCi/ml). Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Fos129-153, Fra proteins were identified by anti-c-Fos129-153 immunoblotting (right panel) and autoradiography (left panel).

The ~55-kDa c-Fos signal, a less modified form of c-Fos (37Curran T. Morgan J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8521-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was detected by anti-c-Fos129-153 (Fig. 2A) and anti-c-Fos3-16 (data not presented); this signal did not increase in response to treatment with 0.1 μM NE. However, a higher concentration of NE (1.0 and 10 μM) caused a 20-fold increase in 55-kDa c-Fos, with a peak at 3 h; this confirms previous findings in organ culture(14Carter D.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).It is of interest to compare in vivo changes in expression of 42/46 -Fra and c-Fos (Fig. 1A) with those seen in vitro due to NE treatment (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the physiological profile seems to be reproduced by treatment with 0.1 μM NE. Higher doses produce large changes in c-Fos protein not seen in vivo.NE is known to act on the pineal gland through α- and β-adrenergic receptors (ARs). To determine whether Fra-42/46 was regulated by NE by one or the other receptor we used relatively selective AR agonists. Treatment with the selective β-AR agonist isoproterenol increased 42/46-kDa Fra; however, the α-AR agonist phenylephrine was without effect (Fig. 2B).5 In addition, the NE response was blocked by the β-AR antagonist propranolol but not by the α-AR antagonist prazosin. These findings imply that the β-AR is essential for adrenergic regulation of Fra-42/46 protein, but that the α-AR is not.Evidence of β-adrenoreceptor regulation points to cyclic AMP as the second messenger controlling Fra-42/46. This was supported by the finding that treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP; Fig. 2B) or forskolin (10 μM; data not shown) increased Fra-42/46. The response to Bt2cAMP was not inhibited by propranolol, providing further evidence that propranolol blocked effects of NE through selective interaction with the β-AR.The involvement of other second messengers was examined by treating glands with a cyclic GMP analog (dibutyryl cyclic GMP, 1 mM), with [Ca2+]i elevating agents (10 μM ionomycin or 20 μM A23187) or with an activator of protein kinase C (100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). None elevated Fra-42/46 (data not shown).6 Accordingly, it appears that cyclic AMP is the essential second messenger mediating the effects of NE on Fra-42/46.Examination of the Western blots in Figure 1:, Figure 2: indicates that during the period Fra-42/46 abundance is increased, there is a subtle upward shift in the dominant component of this broad signal, as seen with other Fra systems(34Young S.T.

Kovary K. Metz R. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2537-2547PubMed Google Scholar). This appears to be associated with phosphorylation because (a) treatment with alkaline phosphatase shifted the 46-kDa component of the signal toward the 42-kDa component (Fig. 2C), and (b) the 46-kDa and, to a lesser extent, the 42-kDa component became labeled in glands incubated with Bt2cAMP and 32P-labeled NaO3PO4 (Fig. 2D). Phosphorylation of c-Fos was also observed (Fig. 2D, NE).Evidence That fra-2 mRNA Encodes Fra-42/46We found that NE stimulation of Fra-42/46 was blocked by either actinomycin D or cycloheximide, demonstrating that these responses rely upon de novo transcription and translation (Fig. 2B, third panel). This pointed to the possibility that we could determine the identity of Fra-42/46 by identifying an mRNA that exhibited similar dramatic circadian changes. An RT-PCR approach was used with cDNA from control and NE treated glands; the primers selected bracket the full coding sequence of c-fos, fra-1, and fra-2(15Curran T. Reddy E.P. Skalka A.M. Curran T.

A robust ~980-bp RT-PCR product was generated from template derived from NE-treated but not control glands (Fig. 3A).Sequence analysis indicated this product encodes a protein which contains the peptide sequence recognized by anti-c-Fos129-153 and is 98%, 97%, and 93% homologous to mouse, human, and chick Fra-2, respectively(19Matsui M.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3305-3311PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it is the rat homolog of Fra-2 (Fig. 3B). All known Fra-2 transcripts encode ~35-36-kDa proteins with multiple candidate phosphorylation sites.A prominent ~6.7-kb Fra-2 transcript was strongly expressed during a short period of a light/dark cycle starting ~1.5 h after lights off (Fig. 3C, upper panel, lane 4) and was induced in glands from rats injected with the β-AR agonist ISO but not in glands from animals injected with the α-AR agonist PE (Fig. 3C, upper panel, lanes 12 and 13). The Fra-2 transcript was increased during subjective night in animals maintained in constant darkness for 4 days (data not shown). Changes in the abundance of this transcript were paralleled by changes in the strength of a ~2.5-kb signal. The above observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the ~6.7-kb fra-2 transcript encodes either Fra-35 or Fra 42/46, or both.c-fos mRNA was also analyzed (Fig. 3C, middle panel). The 2.4-kb c-fos transcript was expressed throughout the same 24-h sampling period, and was 2-3-fold higher ~1.5 h after the onset of darkness, as previously reported(13Carter D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Carter D.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We also were able to confirm that the strength of this signal increased transiently >10-fold following a 1-h treatment with 10 μM NE (not shown; (14Carter D.A. Mol.

Studies on neurotensin catabolism in vitro by membrane fractions or cell lines of central or peripheral origin indicated that endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 was the only peptidase that ubiquitously contributed to the inactivation of this neuropeptide(4Checler F.

In the central nervous system, we recently showed that mixed inhibitors of endopeptidases 3.4.24.16 and 3.4.24.15 potently enhanced the neurotensin-induced analgesia in the hot plate-tested mice (7Vincent B. Dive V. Yiotakis A. Smadja C. Maldonado R. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Altogether, this indicates that endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 contributes to the catabolism of neurotensin in vivo in the periphery but also likely in the central nervous system. The characterization of the biochemical and pharmacological properties of endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 indicated that the enzyme behaved as a 70-75-kDa monomer that was inhibited by metal chelators and dithiothreitol(3Checler F. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11274-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies suggested that endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 resembles another metallopeptidase, endopeptidase 3.4.24.15. Particularly, studies on the specificity of endopeptidase 3.4.24.15 showed that the enzyme cleaved several neuropeptides at peptidyl bonds that were reminiscent of those targeted by endopeptidase 3.4.24.16(8Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 9Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, several aspects that included the nature of the cleavage site on neurotensin, the sensitivity to dipeptide inhibitors and dithiothreitol, as well as immunological data clearly distinguished the two peptidases(10Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Neurochem. Life Sci. Adv. 1991; 10: 115-124Google Scholar). The present paper reports on the molecular cloning and expression of rat brain endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 and establishes that the two peptidases are related but clearly distinct molecular entities.

Pro-Ile, dithiothreitol, o-phenanthroline, and 4-chloro-1-naphtol were purchased from Sigma. Phosphoramidon (N-(α-L-rhamnopyranosyloxydihydroxylphosphinyl)-L-leucyl-L-tryptophan) was from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Captopril was from the SQUIBB Institute. Phosphodiepryl 20 was synthesized and kindly given by Dr. V. Dive (CEN Saclay, France). A rat brain cDNA library constructed in the λZAPII vector (Stratagene) was screened with a polyclonal antibody raised against the rat brain endopeptidase 3.4.24.16(1Checler F. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Approximately 6 × 105 recombinant phages were plated and incubated at 42°C for 3.5 h; then each plate was overlaid with a nylon filter previously saturated in 10 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. The filters were blocked overnight at 4°C in TBST buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) containing 5% of fat milk, then incubated for 8 h at 4°C with a 1/1000 dilution of the primary antibody in TBST containing 1% of fat milk. Filters were washed three times (5 min each) in TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1% fat milk TBST containing a 1/2500 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The antibody-antigen complexes were revealed with the chromogenic substrate 4-chloro-1-naphtol as described previously(1Checler F. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of 14 isolated positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript by in vivo excision according to the manufacturer's procedures (Stratagene). A clone, λ7a with an insert of 1806 bp, 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. was sequenced and showed an open reading frame of 1613 bp, lacking the 5′-region coding for the N-terminal domain of the protein. Using two synthetic oligonucleotides, a polymerase chain reaction fragment of 1390 bp was derived from the λ7a clone, labeled with 32P by random-priming (Appligene), and used as a probe to screen 6 × 105 clones of the above λZAPII cDNA library. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65°C in 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 0.2 mg/ml heat-denatured herring sperm DNA. The filters were washed in 3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and autoradiographied. A clone, λB1 containing an insert of 2158 bp, was isolated. This clone encompassed 1516 bp of clone λ7a (Fig. 1) but lacks the complete 3′-region as illustrated by the absence of a stop codon. Therefore the full-length cDNA was reconstituted with these two overlapping cDNAs by ligating a 380-bp NcoI-EcoRI fragment of λ7a with a 2120-bp KpnI-NcoI fragment of λB1. The resulting insert, λ7aB1, was subcloned in pBluescript previously digested with KpnI-EcoRI. This construction allowed us to confirm the whole sequence of the cDNA and to verify that the ligation of the two fragments occurred without introduction of errors in the coding phase. base pair(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography. The automated sequencing was performed by means of the dideoxy chain termination method (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar) on both strands by walking along the cDNA using synthetic oligonucleotides according to the strategy described in Fig. 1. Poly(A)+ mRNAs were prepared from rat tissues by purification on oligo(dT) columns. 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNAs were electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the polymerase chain reaction probe derived from the λ7a clone described above, in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution, and 0.2 mg/ml heat-denatured herring sperm DNA for 15 h at 42°C. The filter was washed two times at room temperature in 1 × SSC, 0,1% SDS and two times at 50°C in 0,5 × SSC, 0,1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed at -70°C for 3 days. The λ7aB1 fragment was excised from pBluescript with KpnI-EcoRI and subcloned into the KpnI-EcoRI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Semi-confluent COS-7 cells, grown in 100-mm cell culture dishes, were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-7aB1 by the DEAE-dextran precipitation method(12Perlman J.H. Nussenzveig D.R. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24413-24417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negative control was performed in the same conditions with 1 μg of pcDNA3 vector (mock-transfected COS-7 cells). Approximately 48 h after transfection, the cells were collected, washed with 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 250 mM sucrose and 1 mM EDTA, centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm, and homogenized in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with γ globulin as standard(13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). QFS (50 μM) was incubated for various times at 37°C with COS-7 cells protein homogenate (final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml of protein) in a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitors. Incubations were stopped with 2.5 ml of sodium formate, pH 3.7, and fluorimetrically monitored at λ345 nm and λ405 nm as described previously(14Checler F. Barelli H. Dauch P. Dive V. Vincent B. Vincent J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 593-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Neurotensin (2 nmol) and QFS (5 nmol) were incubated for various times at 37°C with COS-7 cells protein homogenate (final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml of protein) in a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the absence or in the presence of inhibitors. Reactions were stopped, centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and then supernatants were HPLC analyzed with the triethylamine/trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile chromatographic system previously described(4Checler F. Barelli H. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein homogenates from pcDNA3-7aB1 transfected COS-7 cells or subcellular fractions (100,000 × g supernatant and pellet) were incubated for 10 h at 37°C with 0.15 units of endoglycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 40 mM EDTA, 1% n-octylglucoside, 0.1% SDS, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted as described below. Samples were analyzed on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred onto a nylon membrane. Hybridization conditions with a 1/1000 dilution of the IgG-purified fraction of the polyclonal antiserum developed toward rat brain endopeptidase 3.4.24.16, and the revelation of the IgG-antigen complexes were as described previously(1Checler F. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We previously purified endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 from rat brain by means of various chromatographic steps and preparative SDS-PAGE (for review see (14Checler F. Barelli H. Dauch P. Dive V. Vincent B. Vincent J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 593-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). This allowed us to obtain sufficient amounts of purified material to raise a polyclonal antiserum, the purified IgG fraction of which specifically recognized the native and denaturated forms of endopeptidase 3.4.24.16(1Checler F. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This immunological tool allowed us to finally obtain a 2448-bp-long cDNA (clone λ7aB1, see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1), of which the longest open reading frame of 2112 bp encoded a 704-amino acid polypeptide of theoretical molecular mass of 80,202 daltons and bore the HEXXH consensus sequence (residues 497-501, Fig. 2) that is the structural signature of members of the zinc metalloprotease family(15Jongeneel C.V. Bouvier J. Bairoch A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Hydropathic profile (Fig. 3) did not delineate a putative signal peptide but indicated several hydrophobic stretches around the consensus sequence (Fig. 3). A cluster of charged amino acid residues (residues 331-335 and 341-348) and three putative Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus sequences for glycosylation sites were also identified on the sequence (Fig. 2). The 3′-end of the cDNA of clone λ7aB1 was 193 bp long and did not reveal a polyadenylation signal, indicating that the 3′-non-coding region was likely not complete.Figure 3:Hydropathic profile of endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 protein sequence. Hydropathy analysis of the amino acid-deduced sequence was obtained by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (44Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17208) Google Scholar) with a window size of 10 residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blot analysis performed with rat brain, ileum, kidney, and testis poly(A)+ mRNAs consistently revealed two mRNA species of about 3 and 5 kilobases, the lower molecular weight label always being prominent (Fig. 4). It is noticeable that the label was lower in brain than in other tissues (Fig. 4). This is in agreement with our data concerning the relative endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 activities detected in various tissues(14Checler F. Barelli H. Dauch P. Dive V. Vincent B. Vincent J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 593-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear as to whether the discrepancy observed between the sizes of these two mRNA species reflects a variable length of their non-coding 3′-region, consequently, to two distinct polyadenylation sites. An alternative hypothesis could be that the higher molecular weight mRNA represents an intermediate immature form of the mRNA. Finally, the possibility that the mRNAs encode two distinct proteins could be evoked. However, such a hypothesis is not sustained by our previous data indicating that in whole rat brain homogenate, a tissue that would be expected to contain all the various putative molecular forms of the peptidase, we consistently detected a single immunolabeled protein migrating with the apparent molecular weight of the recombinant peptidase(1Checler F. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). λ7aB1 cDNA was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and transiently transfected in COS-7 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that these whole cells overexpressed a 70-75-kDa protein that was recognized by anti-rat brain endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 (Fig. 5A, lane 2), while mock-transfected COS-7 cells did not (Fig. 5A, lane 1). The label appears mainly associated with the soluble fraction prepared from the transfected cells, although a minor membrane-associated immunoreactive protein was also observed (Fig. 5B). Deglycosylation experiments did not affect the apparent molecular weight of the immunoreactive proteins, whatever the subcellular fraction that was examined (Fig. 5B). The enzymatic activity of the expressed protein was examined by means of a quenched fluorimetric substrate (QFS) that was previously shown to behave as a good substrate of endopeptidase 3.4.24.16(16Dauch P. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An important QFS-hydrolyzing activity was monitored in pcDNA3-7aB1 transfected COS-7 cells (specific activity of 60-80 nmol/h/mg of proteins) but not in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). HPLC analysis indicated that one of the cleavage products eluted with the retention time of 3-carboxy-7-methoxycoumarin-Pro-Leu (Fig. 6B). This agreed well with data obtained with purified endopeptidase 3.4.24.16(16Dauch P. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The QFS hydrolysis was dose-dependently and fully prevented by the endopeptidase 3.4.24.16 dipeptide blocker, Pro-Ile (Fig. 6C) and dithiothreitol (Fig. 6D) with Ki values of about 180 μM and 0.4 mM, respectively, in good agreement with the Ki values reported for the purified endopeptidase 3.4.24.16. Furthermore, the activity was totally abolished by 1 mM of o-phenanthroline but remained unaffected by saturating concentrations of captopril, phosphoramidon, and phosphodiepryl 20, the fully specific inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme(17Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Cushman D.W. Science. 1977; 196: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar), endopeptidase 3.4.24.11(18Suda H. Aoyagi T. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1973; 10: 621-623Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and endopeptidase 3.4.24.15, respectively (data not shown). Transfected COS-7 cells readily cleaved neurotensin at a single peptide bond as indicated by the HPLC analysis that revealed the only formation of neurotensin(1Checler F. Barelli H. Vincent J.P.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) 1The abbreviations used are: NPYneuropeptide YRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsbpbases pair(s)kbkilobase(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionUTRuntranslated region sequence. is an abundant neuropeptide that mediates a wide range of biological actions including the regulation of appetite, cardiovascular activity, and endocrine secretion. NPY receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, and several receptor subtypes have been classified on the basis of their pharmacology (reviewed in (1Dumont Y. Martel J.C. Fournier A. St-Pierre S. Quirion R. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 38: 125-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar)). The NPY-Y1 and NPY-Y2 receptor subtypes can be distinguished by their ability to bind various analogs and fragments of NPY. The NPY-Y1 receptor selectively binds an analog of NPY, [Leu31,Pro34]NPY, while the NPY-Y2 receptor has higher affinity for the NPY (13-36) fragment(2Fuhlendorff J. Gether U. Aakerlund L.

In the cardiovascular system, the NPY-Y1 receptor mediates both direct vasoconstriction and the potentiation of other pressor agents such as norepinephrine(6Wahlestedt C. Edvinsson L. Ekblad E. Hakanson R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 234: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of Y1 selective agonists also affects appetite and the secretion of luteinizing hormone, suggesting involvement of the NPY-Y1 receptor(7Quirion R. Martel J.C. Dumont Y. Cadieux A.

DNA sequences encoding the NPY-Y1 receptor have been cloned from several species including human, rat, mouse, and Xenopus(10Herzog H. Hort Y.J. Ball H.J. Hayes G. Shine J. Selbie L.A. Proc. Natl.

The human cDNA encodes a protein 384 amino acids in length that is preceded by approximately 200 base pairs (bp) of 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) sequence. Analysis of the genomic structure has determined the presence of a 6.4-kb intron within the 5′-UTR as well as a small intron within the coding region. The gene for the receptor has been localized to chromosome 4q(31.3-32)(14Herzog H. Baumgartner M. Vivero C. Selbie L.A. Auer B. Shine J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the analysis of NPY-Y1 receptor cDNAs from a testis cDNA library, a cDNA clone was identified that differed from the previously determined NPY-Y1 receptor sequence at the 5′-end of the clone. The two sequences diverged at the point where exon 1 splices onto exon 2. This suggests that two exons are alternatively spliced at this site. Although this has no effect on the protein sequence of the receptor, it does have consequences for the regulation of the gene, as transcription may be under the control of multiple promoters. To determine whether alternative promoters are used in the transcription of the NPY-Y1 receptor gene, cDNA clones were isolated from a range of different cDNA libraries, and the 5′ sequences of NPY-Y1 mRNA were examined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Alternate 5′-exons were identified in the structure of the NPY-Y1 receptor gene, and the selective activation of the different promoters for the NPY-Y1 receptor was investigated by measuring the expression of the various NPY-Y1 transcripts in different cell types. Human cDNA libraries (testis, intestine, kidney (Clontech), lung (Stratagene)) were screened with a 32P-labeled 0.6-kb fragment (nucleotides 817-1437) of the human NPY-Y1 cDNA. Plasmid or bacteriophage DNA was transferred to nylon membranes (DuPont NEN) and hybridized with the probe in a solution of 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's, and 0.5% SDS at 65°C for 16 h. Membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min followed by a wash for 15 min at 65°C in 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS. The filters were then exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, X-Omat) at -70°C for 16 h using an intensifying screen. Positive colonies were purified, and DNA was isolated using a standard mini-prep or bacteriophage lysate method (15Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A human peripheral blood genomic library (Promega) was screened with 32P-labeled probes derived from the 5′-end of the human NPY-Y1 published genomic sequence as well as the 5′-exon sequences found in the testis cDNA clone and 5′-RACE clone. Hybridization conditions were the same as described above. DNA from the purified plaques was prepared by the bacteriophage lysate method(15Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). λ DNA was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, or SacI to allow subcloning of the fragments into the pUC119 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Supercoiled plasmid DNA was alkaline-denatured and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Oligonuceotide primers were from the vector sequence and from the genomic sequence obtained. Human genomic DNA (8 μg) or λ genomic clones were digested with restriction enzymes and run on a 0.7% agarose gel. The DNA was capillary-transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham) in 0.4 M NaOH and hybridized as described above. RNA was extracted from tissues and cell lines with guanidium isothiocyanate and precipitated by centrifugation through a cesium chloride cushion(15Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using a commercially available kit (Poly(A) tract system, Promega). cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of poly(A)+ RNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the primer Y1#1 5′-CCTGGGAAAATAATGTTG-3′. The cDNA was tailed with adenosine residues using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Boerhinger Mannheim) and was amplified using an anchor primer 5′-GAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ and the Y1#1 primer. The DNA was reamplified with the same anchor primer and a nested Y1-specific primer Y1#2 5′-ATGGACAGTATGTTTCTTCA-3′. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel, and the amplification products, further identified by Southern blotting, were subcloned into the pUC119 vector. 1 pmol of each primer was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to 500 ng of SK-N-MC cell line poly(A)+ RNA. cDNA was synthesized as described above and reaction products were separated on a 6% acrylamide gel, dried, and visualized by autradiography. A DNA sequencing reaction was run alongside the reaction products to enable the determination of product lengths. Each primer was designed to anneal specifically to one of the three 5′-exon sequences: Y1#3 (5′-CTGAACAATCCTCTTTGGAA-3′), Y1#4 (5′-AACTGAACAATCCGGGTGGA-3′), and Y1#5 (5′-AACTGAACAATCTGCTCCAG-3′). cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase in a reaction containing 10 μg of total RNA from human kidney, artery, and the SK-N-MC cell line. The equivalent of 1 μg of RNA was then amplified using one primer from the NPY-Y1 common sequence, Y1#1, and the other primer specific to a particular exon sequence, Y1#6 (5′-CATTCCCACCCTTCCTTCTT-3′), Y1#7 (5′-CGGATCCCCGACACTCTCCT-3′), or Y1#8 (5′-AGCTGACTTCTTACAGAGCC-3′). DNA was amplified using AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Corp.). The reactions were denatured at 92°C for 1 min before undergoing 35 cycles of 20 s at 92°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 20 s at 72°C. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and detected by hybridization to an oligonucleotide, Y1#2. The screening of cDNA libraries, from kidney, intestine, and lung, resulted in the isolation of several different NPY-Y1 receptor cDNA clones. Some of these clones extended past the splice site in the 5′-UTR, and all were found to be identical to the published NPY-Y1 receptor sequence, obtained from a hippocampus cDNA library(10Herzog H. Hort Y.J. Ball H.J. Hayes G. Shine J. Selbie L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A divergent cDNA clone encoding the human NPY-Y1 receptor was isolated from a testis cDNA library. The coding region of the cDNA and the 151-bp preceding the start codon are identical to the published cDNA sequence. However, the very 5′-end of the testis clone contains a 75-bp sequence that bears no homology to the previously determined cDNA or genomic sequence(14Herzog H. Baumgartner M. Vivero C. Selbie L.A. Auer B. Shine J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The divergence occurs at a splice junction within the 5′-UTR(14Herzog H. Baumgartner M. Vivero C. Selbie L.A. Auer B. Shine J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the two different forms of the NPY-Y1 mRNA are the result of alternative RNA splicing at this site. To investigate the possibility of alternative 5′-exons in the NPY-Y1 gene, the 5′-RACE method was used to analyze the 5′-ends of NPY-Y1 transcripts expressed in the SK-N-MC cell line. This cell line is derived from a human neuroblastoma and endogenously expresses the NPY-Y1 receptor(16Sheikh S.P. O'Hare M.M.T. Tortora O. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6648-6654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 64 of the 85 clones, obtained using the 5′-RACE method, have an identical sequence to that previously found in hippocampal cDNA(10Herzog H. Hort Y.J. Ball H.J. Hayes G. Shine J. Selbie L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). None contain the sequence found in the testis cDNA clone. However, the remainder (21 clones) contain a third form of the NPY-Y1 transcript, which diverges at the same point as the other two cDNAs, indicating that at least three exons are alternatively spliced at this site. We nominated the 5′ sequence found in the published hippocampus cDNA clone as exon 1A. The sequence present in the testis clone was termed exon 1B, and the sequence obtained from the 5′-RACE clones was identified as exon 1C. Chromosome walking and screening with the different 5′-exon sequences led to the isolation of several overlapping genomic clones spanning over 40 kb of the human NPY-Y1 receptor gene. A complete restriction map of the clones was prepared for the restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII (Fig. 1). This map was confirmed using Southern blots of genomic DNA. Exon 1A is located 6.4 kb upstream of exon 2(14Herzog H. Baumgartner M. Vivero C. Selbie L.A. Auer B. Shine J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 1B was found a further 12 kb upstream of exon 1A, and exon 1C another 5.5 kb upstream of exon 1B. Consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences are found at all splice donor and acceptor sites in the NPY-Y1 receptor gene (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Exon/intron structure and splice sites in the 5′-UTR of the human NPY-Y1 receptor gene. Open boxes represent untranslated sequence, and closed boxes represent the coding region of the gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To aid in the identification and characterization of the different promoters, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking regions of each of the 5′-exons (Fig. 3). The transcription start sites were determined by primer extension using primers specific for each exon sequence (Fig. 4). The size of exon 1A was determined to be 80 bp, and the size of exon 1B was 106 bp. Transcription of exon 1C begins at a number of positions, with the major start site being 109 bp before the splice junction. The transcription start sites are in accordance with those found in the 5′-RACE clones. The sequences of the 5′-exons contained in the 5′-RACE clones are identical to the genomic sequence, indicating that no further splicing occurs within these exons.Figure 4:Transcription start sites of the 5′-exons determined by primer extension. cDNA was reverse transcribed from SK-N-MC mRNA using radioactively labeled primers, each designed to anneal to a different 5′-exon sequence (lanes 3, 6, and 9). Also shown are negative controls that had either reverse transcriptase (lanes 1, 4, and 7) or RNA (lanes 2, 5, and 8) omitted from the reaction. A DNA sequencing reaction was run next to the reactions to enable the size of the products to be determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Promoter A lacks a typical TATA and CCAAT box. However, it contains a potential cyclic AMP response element, 5′-CGACGTCA-3′, at position -92 and an AP-1 binding site, 5′-TGAATCA-3′, at position -763(17Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J.

Also present is a putative binding site for octamer-binding proteins (Oct-1), 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′, at position -889(19Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Promoter B also lacks the canonical TATA and CCAAT motifs and has a high G+C content (approximately 70%) in the 200 bp preceding the transcription start site. Two possible binding sites, 5′-CCGCGGGC-3′, for the transcription factor AP-2 are found at positions -49 and -110 (20Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R.

The only obvious transcription factor binding site in promoter C is a potential response element for the glucocorticoid receptor at position -357(21von der Ahe D. Janich S. Scheidereit C. Renkawitz R. Schutz G. Beato M. Nature. 1985; 313: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The promoter also lacks a TATA and/or CCAAT box. Expression of the different 5′-exons was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR in the SK-N-MC cell line and several tissues including kidney and artery (Fig. 5). A Y1-specific primer from exon 2 was used to reverse transcribe NPY-Y1 mRNA. The cDNA was then amplified using the exon 2 primer and one primer specific for exon 1A, 1B, or 1C. PCR products were detected by hybridization to an internal oligonucleotide. As an internal control, a portion of the coding region was also amplified to compare the overall levels of NPY-Y1 receptor transcript in the different tissues. NPY-Y1 transcripts containing exon 1A and exon 1B could be detected in both the kidney and arterial tissues and the SK-N-MC cell line. Exon 1C could be amplified from the SK-N-MC cell line and to a much lesser extent from kidney tissue. Transcripts containing exon 1C could not be detected in arterial RNA. The genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors comprise a very large gene family. Although many members of this family have been found to lack introns, many others have a non-contiguous structure, including a growing number of genes that have been found to contain introns within the 5′-UTR. Receptor genes displaying alternative splicing within the 5′-UTR include the porcine muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, the rat endothelin ETA receptor, the human interleukin 8 IL8RB receptor, and the human thromboxane receptor (23Peralta E.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25253-25259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of NPY-Y1 transcripts expressed in the SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cell line shows that at least three exons are alternatively spliced onto the 5′-end of the NPY-Y1 receptor mRNA. The murine NPY-Y1 receptor gene has also been cloned and, like the human gene, has a 6-kb intron situated approximately 150 bp upstream of the start codon(12Eva C. Oberto A. Sprengel R. Genazzani E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Primer extension of the murine NPY-Y1 mRNA, to determine the transcription-initiation site, revealed the presence of five transcripts of various sizes. This was interpreted to be the result of multiple transcription-initiation sites within the same exon sequence. A limitation of this method is that the sequences of the transcripts are not known, and it cannot be distinguished whether the different-sized transcripts are a continuation of the same exon sequence or the result of a splicing event. In the light of this work on the human NPY-Y1 gene, it is very likely that at least some of the multiple transcription-initiation sites found in the mouse gene are also the result of different 5′-exons being spliced onto the splice acceptor site within the 5′-UTR. Alternative splicing of sequences within the 5′-UTR has been demonstrated to regulate receptor expression at the translational level (27Ren H. Stiles G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4864-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For example, the presence of open reading frames within the 5′-UTR can result in the inefficient initiation of translation and suppression of protein expression(28Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The human NPY-Y1 receptor gene contains a short open reading frame in the 5′-UTR situated on exon 2. In addition, exon 1C also contains a short open reading frame; however, no start codons are present in either exon 1A or 1B. The differential use of these 5′-exons may be a mechanism for translational regulation of the NPY-Y1 receptor protein. The selective activation of the promoters for the NPY-Y1 receptor was investigated by analyzing the relative abundance of the three different forms of Y1 transcript in various tissues. Reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated that exon 1C was expressed in the SK-N-MC cell line, to a lesser extent in kidney, and not at all in artery, indicating that promoter C is activated in a tissue-specific manner. The majority of 5′-RACE and cDNA clones isolated have contained the exon 1A sequence at their 5′-ends. This suggests that the transcript containing exon 1A is the most abundant NPY-Y1 transcript in the tissues analyzed. It remains possible that other 5′-exons represent the major transcripts in other tissues. For example, when the testis cDNA library was screened, a cDNA clone containing exon 1B was isolated, although no clones containing exon 1A or 1C were obtained. The sequences upstream of the 5′-exons were analyzed for possible response elements for transcription factors. The transcription start sites were first determined by primer extension. Although it has previously been reported that a major transcription start site occurs 208 bp upstream of the start codon(14Herzog H. Baumgartner M. Vivero C. Selbie L.A. Auer B. Shine J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this did not correspond with any of the transcription start sites we observed using primer extension and 5′-RACE on kidney and SK-N-MC RNA. The 208-bp start site was determined by primer extension using a primer annealing to exon 2 of the gene and did not identify which 5′-exon was involved. It is possible that the transcription start site represents an additional 5′-exon sequence and/or the utilization of a different transcription start site that was undetected in this study. None of the three promoter regions for the human NPY-Y1 gene had typical TATA or CCAAT boxes close to the transcription start sites. Many other G protein-coupled receptor genes also lack these motifs in their promoters, including the genes for the rat bradykinin B2 receptor, human adenosine A1 receptor, as well as numerous examples from the adrenergic, dopamine, and serotonin receptor families (29Pesquero J.B.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More than one transcription start site, as seen with exon 1C, is often a feature of these genes. The promoter preceding exon 1B has a very high G+C content that, along with the absence of TATA and CCAAT boxes, is characteristic of promoters for “housekeeping” genes. Little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the NPY-Y1 receptor gene. Administration of glucocorticoids to rats causes an up-regulation of NPY-Y1 receptor expression in the arcuate nucleus, although it is not known if this is a direct effect of the glucocorticoids acting on the NPY-Y1 receptor gene promoters(32Larsen P.J. Jessop D.S. Chowdrey H.S. Lightman S.L. Mikkelsen J.D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, in the human gene, there are potential binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor in promoters B and C. An increase in NPY-Y1 mRNA levels in the rat spinal cord is observed in response to peripheral inflammation(33Ji R. Zhang X. Wiessenfeld-Hallin Z. Hokfelt T. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6423-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor NF-κB is an important regulator of genes activated during the immune response, and potential binding sites for this transcription factor exist in promoter A of the human gene as well as in the promoter for the murine NPY-Y1 receptor gene. The studies reported here demonstrate the existence of multiple transcripts of the human NPY-Y1 receptor mRNA, which are generated by the alternative splicing of three different 5′-exons onto a splice acceptor site within the 5′-UTR of the gene. The transcription of this receptor gene is thus under the control of at least three promoters that are activated in a tissue-specific manner and that may play an important role in the regulation of expression of the NPY-Y1 receptor and its function in a wide variety of physiological responses.

In BHK-21 cells, this dye monitors free [Ca] in principally one type of ATP-dependent Ca-sequestering organelle in which intrastore Ca was released uniformly and entirely by 100 nM thapsigargin or removal of ATP or Ca from the bath, and was reduced by 85% upon treatment with a supramaximal dose of InsP3 (6 microM). Examination of the spatial distribution of InsP3-sensitive Ca stores showed that InsP3 released Ca throughout all regions of the cell, although we often noted a perinuclear region (which we speculate may correspond to the Golgi apparatus) with reduced responsiveness to InsP3. InsP3-induced changes of intraluminal Mg could not be detected. Cyclic ADP-ribose, ryanodine, caffeine, mitochondrial inhibitors, and GTP, agents known to influence intraorganellar Ca sequestration in other cell types, were all without effect on the mag-fura-2 ratio. In situ calibration of the mag-fura-2 ratio with Ca ionophores revealed that the average free intraorganellar [Ca] was initially 188 +/- 21 microM in the presence of 170 nM free Ca and 3 mM ATP, and was reduced to 25 +/- 5 microM upon stimulation with 6 microM InsP3. The ionic dependence of the release and reloading process was also investigated. The presence of either K, Na, or Cl could consistently support both InsP3-induced release and the refilling of stores with Ca, but physiological concentrations of HCO3 were effective in sustaining the response in only 24% of cells examined."

Moreover, these individual ribonucleoprotein complexes appear to determine the intracellular translocation of 5 S rRNA.

Similar to the case with TFIIIA, the identity elements for p43 appear to be dispersed over a considerable amount of the 5 S rRNA molecule including helices II, IV, and V as well as loop D(12Zang W.-Q. Romaniuk P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Contacts made by p43 to helical regions of the RNA appear to be more sequence-dependent compared with those made by TFIIIA(12Zang W.-Q. Romaniuk P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the structural similarities between TFIIIA and p43 and their overlapping binding sites on 5 S rRNA, the determinants of high affinity binding are not identical for the two proteins.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) experiments have been used to determine the binding site for rat ribosomal protein L5 or its yeast equivalent, YL3, on 5 S rRNA. The cumulative results are in good agreement and indicate that helices I, II, IV, and V, as well as loops D and E provide the major contact surface for the ribosomal protein. Despite having nearly congruent binding sites on 5 S rRNA, L5 and TFIIIA share no similarity in the sequences of their amino acids(5Wormington W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5281-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Chan Y.-L. Lin A. McNally J. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12879-12886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, two proteins have arisen independently to bind to the same RNA molecule and present a means for the comparative analysis of RNA recognition by two disparate proteins. In order to identify the important recognition elements for Xenopus L5, we have measured binding of the protein to a collection of site-specific mutants made in oocyte 5 S rRNA. Additionally, we have taken the occasion to compare these results with those from analogous experiments involving TFIIIA. 2S. L. Rawlings, G. D. Matt, and P. W. Huber, submitted for publication. A cDNA clone (L5b) of the gene encoding ribosomal protein L5 from Xenopus laevis was kindly provided by Dr. W. M. Wormington (University of Virginia) and used as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification(5Wormington W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5281-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The 38-nucleotide 5′-primer (5′-TAGGATCCATCGAAGGTCGTATGGGGTTCGTAAAGGTC-3′) contained, in turn, a BamHI restriction site, the codons for Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg, which is the recognition sequence for Factor Xa, and 18 nucleotides complementary to the first six codons of L5. The 26-nucleotide 3′-primer (5′-CAGGATCCCTATTAGCTGTCTGCCTT-3′) contained, in turn from the 3′-end, the final six codons of L5, an additional stop codon, and a BamHI restriction site. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction was performed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 ng of the template plasmid; 100 pmol each of the 5′- and 3′-primers; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8; 10 mM KCl; 10 mM (NH4)2SO4; 2 mM MgSO4; 0.1% Triton X-100; 0.2 mM dNTP; 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Cycling was performed at 94°C (1 min), 50°C (2 min), 72°C (2 min) for 30 cycles. The final cycle had an extension time of 10 min. The amplified fragment (920 bp) was purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and then digested with BamHI. The expression vector, pMAL-c (New England Biolabs) was digested with BamHI and treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. The digested vector and polymerase chain reaction product were ligated, and the mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli (DH5α). Individual colonies were screened by restriction mapping for recombinant pMAL-c plasmids with the L5 gene in the proper orientation. The DNA sequence of the L5 gene in the resulting recombinant plasmid, designated pMAL-cL5, was verified using the Sequenase kit for chain-termination sequencing (Amersham Corp.). E. coli (DH5α) transformed with pMAL-cL5 were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1% glucose until the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached approximately 0.4. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 60 μM. Cells were harvested 1 h later by centrifugation at 4°C and suspended in 20 ml of ice-cold affinity column buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl; 5% glycerol; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM DTT) plus protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin; 16 μg/ml pepstatin; 0.8 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 50 uM benzamidine). The solution was degassed prior to adding DTT and protease inhibitors. Care was taken at all times to keep the cells chilled on ice. The cell suspension was lysed using a French press, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman Type 50.2 Ti rotor. The clarified cell extract was then subjected to affinity chromatography at 4°C through amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein was eluted from the resin with column buffer containing 10 mM maltose, divided into aliquots, and stored at -20°C. Analysis by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels established that the eluted fusion protein was greater than 95% pure. The fusion protein produced by the pMAL-cL5 expression vector is designated fL5. Generally, yields exceeded 1 mg of fL5/liter culture. 670 μg of fL5 in 1 ml of affinity column buffer was digested overnight with 7 μg of Factor Xa (Promega) at 0°C. The sample was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 25 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM EDTA; 5 mM benzamidine and then loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2 ml bed volume) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was developed by step elution with buffer containing 0.1 M (3 ml), 0.2 M (4 ml), 0.3 M (4 ml), and then 0.5 M (7 ml) NaCl. The MBP polypeptide eluted at 0.2 M NaCl, and L5 and Factor Xa eluted at 0.5 M NaCl. Fractions containing protein were concentrated using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon) and stored at -20°C. In standard binding assays, approximately 10 μg of fL5 in affinity column buffer was digested with 0.25-1.0 μg of Factor Xa at 0°C for 1 h. Benzamidine was then added to a final concentration of 5 mM to inhibit further proteolysis. This protein solution was then diluted with binding buffer to the desired protein concentration. The construction of the plasmid pT75S, which contains a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase immediately upstream of a Xenopus oocyte 5 S rRNA gene, and of site-specific mutants has been described.2In vitro synthesis of internally radiolabeled 5 S rRNA by run-off transcription was carried out with minor modifications to reported procedures(20Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures of 20 μl contained 5 μg of plasmid linearized with DraI in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 6 mM MgCl2; 10 mM NaCl; 10 mM DTT; 2 mM spermidine; 1.75 mM each of ATP, CTP, and UTP (Promega); 0.25 mM GTP; 80-100 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (ICN); 40 units RNasin (Promega) and were incubated at 37°C for 2 h after the addition of 200 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Epicentre Technologies). RNase-free DNase I (1 unit) was then added and the incubation continued for 20 min. Full-length 5 S rRNA was purified and renatured as reported earlier (21Huber P.W. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Native Xenopus oocyte 5 S rRNA was prepared from 7 S RNP particles isolated from immature oocytes(22Huber P.W. Blobe G.C. Hartmann K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3278-3286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli tRNA was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The concentrations of RNA samples were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm using an extinction coefficient of 22.2 (mg/ml)-1 cm-1. Binding of L5 or fL5 to mutant 5 S rRNAs was measured by a shift in the mobility of the RNA in nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels run at room temperature at 100 V(22Huber P.W. Blobe G.C. Hartmann K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3278-3286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions (10 μl) were performed in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0; 30 mM NH4Cl; 100 mM KCl; 0.5 mM MgCl2; 1 mM DTT; 4% glycerol; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; acetylated bovine serum albumin (0.05 μg/μl); ribonuclease inhibitor (0.2 unit/μl of RNasin, Promega). In experiments to optimize binding conditions, the standard binding buffer was used with the exception of the component being tested. Protein and RNA at the indicated concentrations were mixed gently, avoiding air bubbles as much as possible, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After addition of 0.5 μl of sample solution (0.25% bromphenol blue; 0.25% xylene cyanol; 60% sucrose) each reaction mixture was loaded onto the gel. Autoradiographs of mobility shift gels were scanned with a laser densitometer, and this binding data was processed using the program EZ-fit(24Perrella F.W. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed in duplicate with a minimum of two different preparations of RNA. X. laevis ribosomal protein L5 was expressed as a fusion protein, fL5, using the pMAL-c expression vector(25diGuan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The chimeric protein consists of the E. coli MBP as the amino-terminal domain connected to the ribosomal protein by a linker sequence containing the cleavage site for the protease Factor Xa. The molecular mass of fL5 predicted from the amino acid sequences of the MBP and linker (41,761 Da) plus L5 (34,075 Da) is 75,836 Da. The 5′-primer used for polymerase chain reaction amplification was designed so that cleavage of fL5 by Factor Xa releases the ribosomal protein without any additional amino acid residues at the amino terminus. E. coli (DH5α) carrying the plasmid pMAL-cL5 were grown to mid-log phase and induced to express fL5 with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Analysis of whole cell extracts of uninduced and induced cells by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows the appearance of a single, additional protein after induction having an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 3). The fusion protein is prone to proteolytic degradation; therefore, cells collected by centrifugation were suspended in buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. In addition, samples were continuously kept on ice during all steps of the purification. L5 appears to be easily oxidized, resulting in denatured, insoluble protein. For this reason, all buffers were degassed and contained 1 mM DTT. Cells were lysed using a French press rather than by sonication, since the latter method also appeared to promote oxidation of the protein. Despite these precautions, preparations of the protein, on average, were between 50 and 60% active as determined by Scatchard analysis of 5 S rRNA binding activity (results not shown). Protein that was below this level of activity or that yielded high molecular weight complexes in mobility shift gel assays was discarded. After lysis and centrifugation to remove cellular debris, the crude cell extract was passed through an amylose affinity column, which was subsequently washed with buffer overnight. The retained fusion protein was eluted with buffer containing 10 mM maltose (Fig. 1, lane 4). Digestion of the purified fL5 with Factor Xa produces two polypeptide products having molecular masses of 42 and 34 kDa, which correspond to the MBP domain and L5, respectively (Fig. 1, lane 5). Generally, a small portion of fL5 was resistant to Xa cleavage, presumably due to denaturation and/or aggregation of the protein, which prevented access to the cleavage site. Intact L5 was purified after digestion of the fusion protein by chromatography over DEAE Sephacel as described in “Experimental Procedures.” No contaminating E. coli 5 S rRNA could be detected in samples of affinity-purified fL5 upon staining SDS-polyacrylamide gels with silver. The binding of the fusion protein to 5 S rRNA was compared with L5 purified from the former. In direct titrations of 5 S rRNA, equivalent molar concentrations of the individual proteins bound the same amount of the nucleic acid (Fig. 2A). Purified maltose binding polypeptide has no apparent affinity for 5 S rRNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 3) nor does it influence the binding of L5 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). A stoichiometric mixture of the maltose binding polypeptide and L5, likewise, has the same RNA binding activity as an equivalent amount of the intact fusion protein (Fig. 2B, lane 2 compared with lane 5). The fusion protein, fL5, is more stable than purified L5. Moreover, the former produces a greater retardation of 5 S rRNA in mobility shift gels that decrease the time required for sufficient electrophoretic separation of free and bound RNA. Since the MBP domain has no effect on the binding of L5, we used fL5 in binding assays with mutant 5 S rRNA. However, in all cases where a mutation in 5 S rRNA affected binding of fL5, assays of these RNAs were repeated with L5. In no instance did we observe a quantitative difference between the binding of L5 and the fusion protein. We determined the activity of L5 as a function of pH and monovalent and divalent cation concentrations in order to optimize conditions for binding assays with mutants of 5 S rRNA. Standard binding conditions were buffered at pH 6.0 and 6.5 with 20 mM MES, at pH 6.8, 7.4, and 8.0 with 20 mM HEPES, and at pH 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5 with 20 mM Tris-HCl. Binding isotherms were used to determine the apparent association constant at each value of pH (Fig. 3A). A bell-shaped binding response was obtained with optimal binding occurring between pH 7.5 and 8.5; consequently, we performed standard binding assays at pH 8.0. The data points of the pH profile can be fit to an expression derived for pH effects on the apparent association constant. In this instance, the expression contained terms for two ionizations, and nonlinear regression analysis yielded pKa values of 5.4 and 10.1. The data point at pH 9.5 was not included in the curve fitting, since it represents either the effect of an ionization associated with a third pKa or the appearance of nonspecific binding in these alkaline conditions. It is difficult to attribute the first ionization to a specific amino acid or nucleotide residue, and this value may represent a complex function of both. The second pKa, however, is equivalent to those for the ionization of tyrosine and lysine. Xenopus L5 contains 19 tyrosine residues and 36 lysine residues. We cannot discount that this pKa represents deprotonation of a ring nitrogen of guanosine or uridine, although these latter possibilities seem much less likely. The marked dependence of the binding constant on pH is somewhat unusual for the association of two macromolecules, since oftentimes several functional groups with widely different pKa values contribute to the interaction. For example, the binding of TFIIIA and p43 to 5 S rRNA exhibit little change as a function of pH with only modest decreases in affinity at values above 8.0(12Zang W.-Q. Romaniuk P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of L5 affinity for 5 S rRNA may indicate that a small number of interactions mediate binding or that many of the contacts are chemically similar. The slope of the curve at pKa 10.1 is approximately 2, which indicates that this number of ionizable residues contributes to this transition(26Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Magnesium moderately enhances binding of L5 to 5 S rRNA at low concentrations, but a decrease in affinity is detectable at concentrations greater than 2 mM (Fig. 3B). At 8 mM magnesium, the apparent Ka decreases by more than an factor of 10. Yeh et al.(27Yeh L.-C.C. Horowitz P.M. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17412-17417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that high concentrations of magnesium promote dissociation of the yeast YL3·5 S rRNA complex. Our standard binding assays contained 0.5 mM MgCl2. Since the zinc finger domains of TFIIIA mediate binding of the factor to nucleic acids, micromolar concentrations of zinc are generally included in buffers for this protein. We found that binding of L5 to 5 S rRNA is severely inhibited by micromolar concentrations of zinc with no detectable binding above 30 μM ZnCl2. Consequently, this divalent cation was not included in the standard binding buffer. The interaction of L5 with 5 S rRNA is insensitive to ionic strength. The apparent Ka of the complex remains constant over a range of 0-0.4 M KCl (data not shown). Only a 2-fold decrease in binding affinity was observed at a monovalent salt concentration of 0.6 M. These results indicate that an appreciable contribution to binding comes from nonelectrostatic interactions, which is surprising given that L5 is a highly basic protein with a net charge of +22(5Wormington W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5281-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, this behavior has been observed for other RNA-binding proteins(28Draper D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), including ribosomal proteins(29Schulte C. Morrison C.A. Garrett R.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The absence of an appreciable dependence on salt concentration is particularly meaningful in light of the pH profile that suggests the involvement of tyrosine and/or lysine residues in binding. These results indicate that it is the former amino acid that accounts for the pKa of 10.1. Thus, contacts in which this aromatic residue is stacked upon the base moiety of a nucleotide may contribute significantly to the overall free energy of binding of the ribosomal protein to 5 S rRNA. A concentration of 0.1 M KCl was chosen for standard assays of L5, since this is comparable with the conditions that were used to measure binding of TFIIIA to these same mutants in 5 S rRNA.2 Moreover, higher salt concentrations appear to stabilize the nucleic acid binding activity of the protein. The specificity of binding of fL5 to 5 S rRNA relative to tRNA was tested in a competition assay (Fig. 4). Internally radiolabeled wild-type 5 S rRNA and fL5 were incubated together with increasing concentrations of competing, unlabeled 5 S rRNA or E. coli tRNA. A 100-fold excess of tRNA relative to 5 S rRNA causes only a 40% decrease in binding of fL5 to the cognate RNA. From this experiment the dissociation constant for tRNA relative to that for 5 S rRNA is greater than 50. Thus, the protein discriminates well between 5 S rRNA and nonspecific RNA. Experiments to define the binding site for L5 (rat) or YL3 (yeast) on 5 S rRNA indicate that the contact surface for the protein is quite substantial(13Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7724-7729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Aoyama K. Tanaka T. Hidaka S. Ishikawa K. J. Biochem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been proposed that the nucleic acid binding domains in the three eubacterial proteins that bind to prokaryotic 5 S rRNA have been brought together in the single eukaryotic protein(13Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7724-7729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this conservation is not evident from an analysis of amino acid sequence data(18Chan Y.-L. Lin A. McNally J. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12879-12886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site for rat L5 defined in footprinting experiments overlaps, but is not identical to, that for TFIIIA, explaining why binding of these two proteins to 5 S rRNA is mutually exclusive(16Huber P.W. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3002-3005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIIA protects most of 5 S rRNA from chemical or enzymatic degradation; however, the central domain of the nucleic acid (helix II-loop A-helix V-loop E) provides the major determinants for binding of the factor(9Darsillo P.

Using the luciferase reporter cotransfection assay, we found that the activity of the hTK promoter in IMR-90 normal human diploid fibroblasts was increased by the constitutively over-expressed cyclin A or cyclin E but not by cyclin D, suggesting that the former two cyclins may act as positive regulators for the hTK promoter. The sequence responsible for the transcriptional activation by cyclin E was identified to be located between -133 and -92 of the hTK promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1967488236,"Abortive initiation at the adenovirus E4 promoter was studied by following the production of RNA formed from the initiating nucleotides UpA and CTP. Formation of a specific short RNA via a reaction with appropriate α-amanitin sensitivity required promoter, activator, and ATP. In the absence of any of these, an α-amanitin-resistant reaction led to lower levels of a product of unknown origin. The α-amanitin-sensitive reaction required open promoter complexes, as assayed directly by permanganate probing. This reaction was not blocked by the inhibition of polymerase C-terminal domain kinase activity or by the lack of DNA supercoiling. Thus, formation of the initial bond of the mRNA appears to require activator and ATP to open the DNA but not phosphorylation of the polymerase C-terminal domain. In addition, the abortive initiation reaction was strongly suppressed when all elongation substrates were present, suggesting that cycling to produce high amounts of abortive product is strongly disfavored during productive initiation at this promoter.

In addition, the abortive initiation reaction was strongly suppressed when all elongation substrates were present, suggesting that cycling to produce high amounts of abortive product is strongly disfavored during productive initiation at this promoter. The mechanism by which RNA polymerase II makes the initial bonds of the mRNA and clears the promoter is not well understood. Recent studies have suggested that a number of factors may influence this process. These include the general factors TFIIH, TFIIE, and TFIIF, which may have components that act primarily at these steps (Parvin et al., 1992; Parvin and Sharp, 1993; Chang et al., 1993; Goodrich and Tjian, 1994). In addition, the overall process requires ATP, independent of the use of ATP as an elongation substrate (Bunick et al., 1982; Sawadogo and Roeder, 1984; Conaway and Conaway, 1988; Jiang et al., 1993). The ATP involvement could be at any of several substeps, including opening the DNA template (Wang et al., 1992a; Jiang et al., 1993), phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) 1The abbreviations used are: CTDC-terminal domainAMPPNP5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate. of the polymerase (reviewed by Corden(1990) and Young(1991)), and supporting the helicase activity of TFIIH (Schaeffer et al., 1993; Serizawa et al., 1993b). Each of these activities relies on the hydrolysis of the β-γ bond of ATP, and therefore dATP can act as a substitute. These issues have assumed greater relevance with the emergence of studies, suggesting that some activators may work by facilitating promoter clearance or assisting the resumption of transcription by stalled polymerases (Parada et al., 1995; Narayan et al., 1994; Krumm et al., 1995; Lee and Gilman, 1994; Rasmussen and Lis, 1993; Yankulov et al., 1994). C-terminal domain 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate. A critical step in this overall process is the formation of the first bond of the mRNA. This step has been studied using abortive initiation assays (Luse and Jacob, 1987; Jacob et al., 1991, 1994; Goodrich and Tjian, 1994) based on an analogous reaction used for prokaryotic transcription studies (McClure et al., 1978; Carpousis and Gralla, 1980). In these assays the formation of the first bond is monitored via condensation of a dinucleotide primer and the next encoded nucleoside triphosphate of the transcript. Such reactions appear to properly mimic initiation in the sense that maximal accumulation of the trinucleotide product requires an intact promoter, the dinucleotide primer, nucleoside triphosphate, and an in vitro transcription system in which all components are active. Because the trinucleotide product can in principle be made in very large excess over the amount of template present, the assay allows high detectability even from very inefficient systems. The specificity of this abortive initiation assay has been established, but the requirements for forming the abortive initiation product are yet to be established. Luse and Jacob(1987) suggested that the reaction at the adenovirus major late promoter used ATP β-γ bond hydrolysis, based on the ability of dATP to stimulate production of trinucleotide. This early work pre-dates the studies showing roles for ATP hydrolysis in promoter opening (Wang et al., 1992a), in phosphorylating the polymerase CTD (Cadena and Dahmus(1987); reviewed by Corden(1990) and Young(1991)), and in generic promoter clearance (Goodrich and Tjian, 1994), and thus no mechanistic role was proposed. A later study using purified components confirmed the specificity of the abortive initiation reaction at this promoter (Goodrich and Tjian, 1994) but suggested that ATP was not involved in the steps leading up to and including formation of the first bond of the mRNA. Instead it was suggested that ATP hydrolysis was required for the subsequent steps of promoter clearance, perhaps via an activity associated with factor TFIIH. Thus the requirements for formation of the first mRNA bond and for transcription initiation are unsettled and need further clarification. This is especially true with regard to the various critical steps that use ATP because of its proposed role in three activities: the opening of the DNA and two activities associated with TFIIH. The latter activities are phosphorylation of the polymerase CTD (factor TFIIK) (Feaver et al., 1994; Svejstrup et al., 1995) and DNA helicase activity (Schaeffer et al., 1993; Serizawa et al., 1993b). Each of these three activities has an unknown relationship to forming the first bond of the transcript; thus the role of ATP in first bond formation is especially unclear. An additional unsettled issue relates to the amount of abortive initiation that occurs as a byproduct of productive initiation. Abortive initiation products have been detected under conditions where they could in principle be elongated via nucleotide addition. This is most easily detected at certain promoters greatly weakened by mutation (Jacob et al., 1991, 1994). The extent to which abortive initiation is suppressed during normal, productive initiation at wild type promoters is uncertain. We address these issues by studying abortive initiation at an activated adenovirus E4 promoter. Recently we proposed that initiation at this promoter involves two successive steps that hydrolyze ATP. 2Y. Jiang and J. D. Gralla, submitted for publication. In the first step ATP is used to open the DNA, and in a later step it is used to phosphorylate the polymerase CTD, stimulating the ability of the polymerase to move downstream during initiation. In this scheme the formation of the first bond of the mRNA would require the first of these ATP-dependent steps but perhaps would not require the second step. The results of these experiments will define the requirements for first bond formation at this promoter and will help to integrate abortive initiation and promoter clearance studies, allowing more general models to be proposed and tested. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified ribonucleoside triphosphates and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Sepharose CL-4B and α-amanitin were from Sigma. The CTD kinase inhibitor H8 (N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide dihydrochloride) was from Seikagaku American Inc. Nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (Dignam et al., 1983). The DNA template contains nine GAL4 binding sites upstream of a truncated adenovirus E4 promoter (Carey et al., 1990). RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes were enriched as described previously (Laybourn and Dahmus, 1990; Carey et al., 1986) with modifications as indicated. First, a transcription mixture of 400 μl was set up that contained 250 μl of Hela nuclear extract (protein concentration of 6 mg/ml in D buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCI, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)), 8.25 mM magnesium chloride, 100-300 ng supercoiled template with or without activator GAL4-AH. This was incubated at 30°C for 30 min to allow the assembly of preinitiation complexes and then loaded on a 6-ml Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated with × D buffer with 8 mM magnesium. The column was eluted with the same solution at room temperature in approximately 15 min. DNA elutes in the void volume, which was detected by blue dextran (molecular mass, 2 MDa). This was verified by running fractions on an agarose gel. The enriched preinitiation complexes (typically 0.5 ml) were used immediately. The abortive initiation assay used dinucleotide primer UpA (2 mM) and the next templated nucleotide CTP (1 μM), which is α-32P-radiolabeled. When present, dATP (10 μM) or α-amanitin (1 μg/ml) or 2 mM H8 was added before the addition of UpA and CTP. Standard reactions involved 20 μl of column fraction with added nucleotides for 15 min at 30°C. At this time the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of formamide/8 M urea, and the sample was loaded directly on to a 25% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gel (Carpousis and Gralla, 1980). The time course and interference experiments began with the addition of UpA, CTP, and dATP. The reactions were stopped at various times, and UpApC was assayed as described above. In the α-amanitin interference experiment, α-amanitin was added at 5 min, and the reaction was stopped at 10 min. The elongation substrates interference experiment used a similar protocol except the three elongation substrates were added (GTP and UTP to 25 μM; AMPPNP to 10 μM) instead of α-amanitin. This study involves abortive initiation at an activated version of the adenovirus E4 promoter. Previously, conditions were established for studying productive transcription and open complex formation at this promoter (Carey et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1992a, 1992b; Jiang and Gralla, 1993). The promoter contains a TATA box as a basal element and has upstream sites for the binding of a GAL4-AH hybrid transcription activator. Preinitiation complexes are assembled by mixing a supercoiled template containing this promoter with Hela nuclear extract and activator under conditions known to lead to activator-dependent transcription. This involves very low DNA concentrations in the picomolar range, which enhances the efficiency of the use of template. The mixture is then passed through a Sepharose CL-4B sizing column, which enriches preinitiation complexes (Carey et al., 1986; Laybourn and Dahmus, 1990) and removes free factors, including those that might assist in reinitiation. These enriched preinitiation complexes are the substrates for the various reactions described below. The first experiments will establish conditions associated with the accumulation of either closed or open enriched preinitiation complexes. The conditions of assembly and isolation of the preinitiation complexes described above are expected to lead to the accumulation of closed complexes. This is because ATP was omitted, and prior studies indicated that ATP was required to convert a closed complex to an open complex (Wang et al., 1992a; Jiang et al., 1993). However, this needs to be confirmed directly on the complexes isolated by the column enrichment protocol. In addition, in one prior study, abortive initiation products of the adenovirus major late promoter could be observed without added ATP. In that experiment the only sources of nucleotide were a dinucleotide primer and a low concentrations of the next encoded nucleoside triphosphate (Goodrich and Tjian, 1994). Thus the question was raised as to whether ATP was required for the conversion of a closed complex to an open complex. That is, it was suggested that in some fractionated systems open complexes might form in the absence of ATP and in the presence of substrates allowing first bond formation. Thus we tested whether the isolated E4 preinitiation complexes were in the closed state and whether they could be opened when incubated with such a nucleotide combination. After column isolation of these preinitiation complexes, the dinucleotide UpA and 1 μM CTP were added, which corresponds to a nucleotide combination that supports an abortive initiation reaction at this promoter (confirmed below). The DNA within these complexes was then probed with potassium permanganate. This assay uses sensitivity to potassium permanganate attack as an indicator of the locally melted DNA that is associated with open transcription complexes. If strong bands (permanganate hypersites) are observed over the transcription start site, then open complexes are indicated to be present; the assay has been validated in several prior studies of this promoter (Wang et al., 1992a, 1992b; Jiang and Gralla, 1993; Jiang et al., 1994; Jiang and Gralla, 1995), although in those cases the probing was done directly in crude transcription extracts. Fig. 1A (lanes 1 and 2) shows that permanganate hypersites over the start site region (bar at right) are not observed when the enriched preinitiation complexes are incubated with UpA and 1 μM CTP. By contrast, when 10 μM ATP or dATP is also included, open complexes are readily detected (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). UpA and CTP are not required for the opening reaction as shown by the appearance of open complexes when dATP is the only nucleotide present (Fig. 1B, lane 6). The open complexes nearly disappear when the three missing nucleoside triphosphates are included so as to allow transcription (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 7 and 6); this is expected based on studies showing that the transcription bubble moves downstream with the elongating polymerase (Wang et al., 1992a). A subsequent addition of α-amanitin, which can trap reinitiating complexes prior to column isolation (Jiang and Gralla, 1993), fails to restore the open complex signal (Fig. 1B, lane 8). This is the only result that differs from the properties observed in prior experiments of preinitiation complexes that were not isolated by gel filtration chromatography. The difference indicates that the chromatographic procedure has led to the removal of factors required for reinitiation. We make several conclusions and inferences from these experiments. First, the column-isolated preinitiation complexes formed in this protocol are in the closed complex state. The DNA start site region may be opened in the presence of a low concentration of a source of hydrolyzable ATP. Second, substrates that could direct first bond formation cannot substitute for ATP in this melting reaction. Third, the open complexes formed in the presence of ATP appear to be functional in that the transcription bubble is chased upon the addition of substrates required for elongation. In addition, the gel filtration column isolation of large preinitiation complexes appears to have removed the free factors required to form new open complexes once the isolated complexes have transcribed. We now establish conditions associated with abortive initiation from these enriched preinitiation complexes. Enriched preinitiation complexes were incubated with UpA and 1 μM [α-32P]CTP, and the products were separated on 25% acrylamide/urea gels designed to separate trinucleotide products from the large excess of unincorporated CTP and from radioactive contaminants (Carpousis and Gralla, 1980). Under these conditions the short product in lane 4 of Fig. 2 is observed (position indicated by an arrow). The mobility of this band is in the region of the 25% gel that corresponds to very short RNA species of appropriate length. The appearance of the species on the autoradiograph demonstrates that it contains radioactivity from CTP, which is the only source of radioactivity in the experiment. The band is the only one that is not diminished by treatment with phosphatase, which changes the mobility of RNA bands with triphosphate ends (not shown); this confirms that the product does not contain CTP at its 5′ terminus. If UpA is omitted, the short RNA is the only radioactive band to disappear (lane 2). This band thus has the characteristics expected of the abortive initiation product UpApC. Fig. 3 shows that production of this presumptive abortive initiation product UpApC is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of α-amanitin (lane 3 versus lane 4). The low amount of α-amanitin used is known to selectively block initiation by RNA polymerase II. This is the only band that is inhibited by α-amanitin. These various results support the specificity of the abortive initiation reaction.Figure 3:Specificity of abortive initiation. A, α-amanitin sensitivity in the abortive initiation assay. All samples contained 2 mM UpA and 1 μM labeled CTP. When indicated (+), α-amanitin was present at 1 μg/ml and dATP was present at 10 μM. B, activator requirement. As in A except no activator was present. C, on a template with the TATA box deleted. Activator was present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These observations apply to reactions involving open complexes, that is to reactions performed in the presence of low amounts of dATP (Fig. 2, lane 4), as established by the permanganate probing of Fig. 1. When dATP is omitted, corresponding to a reaction associated with closed complex conditions, the same band appears but in lesser amount (Fig. 2, lane 3 versus the lane 4 signal from open complexes). However, the product appearing under these closed complex conditions is still made in the presence of α-amanitin (Fig. 3, lane 1 versus lane 2). This is in contrast to the reaction from open complexes formed in the presence of ATP. Thus the products produced in the absence of ATP (closed complex conditions) lack the hallmark associated with RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes in that their formation is not blocked by α-amanitin. Previously, we showed that in order to detect functional open complexes at this promoter, a transcription activator must be present (Wang et al., 1992a). Fig. 3B presents the results of abortive initiation assays in which activator was absent. The result is similar to that observed when ATP is absent; although some product is made (Fig. 3B, lane 8), its formation is not reproducibly inhibited by α-amanitin (compare lane 9 versus lane 8 with the loss of signal in the presence of activator in lane 3 versus lane 4). Thus the absence of either ATP or activator leads to a loss of ability to produce the α-amanitin-sensitive abortive initiation product. In addition, inactivation of the promoter by deleting the TATA box also leads to an inability to produce an α-amanitin-sensitive product (Fig. 3C; no loss of signal in lane 14 versus lane 13), an observation that further applies to a promoterless DNA vector (not shown). Thus production of an α-amanitin-resistant product requires the promoter TATA box, an activator, and ATP. These are identical to the requirements for efficient long RNA formation. The background activity, producing trinucleotide in the presence of α-amanitin, is similar to that reported previously in studies of a different abortive initiation product at the adeno major late promoter (Luse and Jacob, 1987). The above data show that this activity is suppressed when ATP, promoter, and activator cooperate to form an open complex (Fig. 3, lane 3). We have not further identified this activity that produces amanitin-resistant RNA. Nonspecific reactions of RNA polymerase II and activities of other polymerases are known to catalyze formation of trinucleotide products in an α-amanitin-resistant reaction (de Mercoyrol et al., 1989). We emphasize that the following experiments use the criterion of appearance of the α-amanitin-sensitive RNA product as an indicator of an appropriate abortive initiation reaction. A number of factors and processes have been suggested to be involved in the transition from preinitiation complex to elongation complex (see the introduction). This overall process includes the critical step of first bond formation. Thus the influences of these factors and processes can be evaluated in the context of the abortive initiation assay. We now test roles for DNA supercoiling and for phosphorylation of the polymerase CTD. DNA supercoiling has been shown to play an important role in influencing transcription initiation in systems using isolated components (Goodrich and Tjian, 1994; Parvin and Sharp, 1993; Timmers, 1994). Certain components are needed for the transition from preinitiation to elongation complex on linear DNA. When the DNA is supercoiled, the transition occurs in the absence of certain of these factors. It is not known if there is a requirement for supercoiling for formation of an α-amanitin-sensitive abortive initiation product at the promoter studied here. Therefore we repeated the abortive initiation assay but substituted a 350-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment (from approximately -240 to +110) for the form I plasmid used in the above experiments. Fig. 4 shows that the α-amanitin-sensitive abortive initiation product is still produced in this protocol (lane 4 versus lane 5). Thus supercoiling is not required for this reaction (as also observed at the adeno major late promoter by Jacob et al.(1991)). We cannot determine if supercoiling influences the extent of either the reaction or its dependence on ATP; this requires two difficult quantitative assays: monitoring any loss of supercoiling in the plasmid and monitoring the amount of active template that survives the column isolation for supercoiled and linear templates. During transcription initiation the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II becomes phosphorylated. Several studies indicate that this reaction occurs during the transition from preinitiation complex to elongation complex (Laybourn and Dahmus, 1989; Payne et al., 1989; Lu et al., 1991). There is considerable uncertainty about the role of this reaction, but it is generally proposed to assist in the transition, especially at activated promoters (reviewed by Drapkin and Reinberg(1994)). Therefore we will test whether inhibiting this activity inhibits the formation of the first bond as monitored by the abortive initiation assay. The CTD kinase activity is associated with the TFIIK component of transcription factor TFIIH (Feaver et al., 1994; Svejstrup et al., 1995). Studies on different promoters have shown that the kinase activity is inhibited by compound H8 (Serizawa et al., 1993a). This compound has been shown to inhibit CTD phosphorylation and transcription levels in the same activated adenovirus E4 transcription system used here (Jiang and Gralla, 1994).2 However, the data of Fig. 4(lane 6 versus lane 7) show that H8 does not strongly inhibit abortive initiation from open complexes. In addition, the product produced in the presence of H8 is still sensitive to α-amanitin (Fig. 4, lane 10 versus lane 11). We showed previously that H8 does not inhibit the formation of open complexes at this same promoter (Jiang and Gralla, 1994).2 Thus the results suggest that H8 inhibition of transcription, and thus the requirement for CTD kinase activity, occurs after formation of the first bond. We next addressed the issue of whether the abortive initiation reaction occurs by reiterative synthesis (as is suggested to occur at the adeno major late promoter by Jacob et al.(1991)). In such reactions short RNA products are continuously released, and then the same preinitiation complex synthesizes them again. This is distinguished from the preinitiation complex simply making the trinucleotide and then stalling, awaiting the missing elongation substrates. In that circumstance the product has not been released and could conceivably be chased into longer products if the missing elongation substrates are added. Two aspects of the experiment shown in Fig. 5 suggest that the reiterative model applies. In this experiment enriched open complexes are incubated with UpA and CTP. At various subsequent times the formation of trinucleotide product is assayed. The amount of product is determined by PhosphorImager counting. The data (Fig. 5, diamonds) show that product is produced continuously over a 12-min time course. In prior studies of this promoter, it was determined that when all four elongation substrates are added to preinitiation complexes, the entire initiation and elongation process is complete within 2 min (Jiang and Gralla, 1993). This of course includes formation of the first bond of the mRNA. Because the abortive initiation reaction is still proceeding well beyond 2 min, it would appear to include more than one cycle of first bond formation, corresponding to the reiterative model. Contributions to this signal from forming new open complexes from dissociated components are very unlikely because such complexes form slowly and were not detected in the experiment of Fig. 1. Another property expected of reiterative reactions is that the RNA made is released and thus cannot be chased into longer products. Thus if the nucleotides required for elongation are added to reactions that have accumulated abortive products then their number should not be reduced. In part of the experiment of Fig. 5, the missing elongation substrates are added after abortive initiation reactions have already proceeded for 5 min; this corresponds to a time at which approximately one-half of the products that normally accumulate during the 12-min time course have already been made. 5 min after this addition of elongation substrates, the amount of abortive product was measured (triangle in Fig. 5). The results showed that there was no reduction in the amount of abortive product. Thus the products that had formed could not be chased efficiently. In addition, the addition of elongation substrates appears to have essentially halted the abortive initiation reaction (see also below). The result is similar to the one obtained if α-amanitin is added at the same time in a parallel reaction (circle in Fig. 5). These characteristics are those expected to be associated with a reaction that proceeds reiteratively in the absence of elongation substrates. Finally the experiment of Fig. 6 tests whether the abortive initiation reaction occurs reiteratively primarily because elongation substrates are absent. That is, it asks if a very significant amount of abortive product can accumulate during normal productive initiation that takes place in the presence of all elongation substrates. The question arises because abortive initiation does occur during normal initiation at certain prokaryotic promoters and has been suggested to occur at certain weak RNA polymerase II promoters (Carpousis and Gralla, 1980; Jacob et al., 1994). Fig. 6 shows the amount of abortive product obtained in parallel reactions with and without elongation substrates. When 50 μM UTP, GTP, and either ATP (lane 4) or AMPPNP and dATP (lane 3) are added to the standard abortive reaction containing UpA and CTP, there is a strong decrease in the signal (compare with a standard reaction in lane 1). The comparison shows that significantly less product is seen when all four elongation substrates are present. Comparable reductions were not seen when any of the elongation substrates were added separately (not shown). In addition no new bands are seen (see Fig. 6) that might correspond to new abortive products that could accompany normal transcription initiation. Thus at this promoter the presence of elongation substrates suppresses abortive initiation, perhaps by favoring RNA extension over release, thus disfavoring the reiterative reaction. Inhibition of CTD kinase activity by H8 can slow the escape of the polymerase from this promoter. 3Y. Jiang and J. D. Gralla, unpublished observations. It is not known how this happens, but one possibility is that the polymerase stalls during first bond synthesis and is caught in an abortive initiation mode. Thus it is possible that under these conditions there will be an enhanced amount of abortive initiation even though all elongation substrates are present. However, the results shown in Fig. 6 suggest that this effect is either weak or absent (lanes 7 and 8 in the presence of H8 and elongation substrates versus lane 5 without elongation substrates). Thus inhibition of CTD kinase activity does not seem to trap polymerase in abortive initiation mode. These experiments have established an abortive initiation reaction at the activated adenovirus E4 promoter and used it to determine requirements for first bond formation. There has been considerable uncertainty about these requirements, especially with regard to the role of ATP (see the introduction). We consider four activities that have previously been proposed to influence the transition from preinitiation complex to elongation complex, which of course includes the critical step of first bond formation. These are polymerase CTD kinase activity, DNA supercoiling, ATP hydrolysis, and activator function. The results of this study suggest that two of these are required for efficient first bond formation at the adenovirus E4 promoter (ATP hydrolysis and activator), whereas the other two activities are not required. We discuss the evidence for these conclusions and attempt to place them in the context of several prior studies. The two factors that are required to produce significant amounts of α-amanitin-sensitive abortive initiation product are a source of β-γ hydrolyzable ATP and a transcription activator. Previous studies have shown that these two factors together are necessary to produce significant amounts of open transcription complexes (Wang et al., 1992a; Jiang et al., 1993). That is, in the absence of either, the preinitiation complexes that accumulate are primarily in the closed form. We conclude that in this system only open complexes produce significant amounts of proper abortive initiation product. The role of ATP hydrolysis in this case is to trigger open complex formation, and it is therefore required indirectly in the process of first bond formation. This conclusion may be compared with two prior studies of abortive initiation, both at the adenovirus major late promoter. Neither prior report studied open complex formation directly, but both addressed the role of ATP. In one case ATP was reported to stimulate abortive initiation (Luse and Jacob, 1987), in agreement with the current findings at the adeno E4 promoter. In addition, they found that abortive initiation in the presence of ATP was inhibited by α-amanitin, as was also found here. In the other case, no ATP stimulation was detected, and the response to α-amanitin was not tested (Goodrich and Tjian, 1994). Of the three studies, the two that agree in these respects have in common the use of Hela extracts as a source of transcription factors and the use of activated transcription (either added GAL-AH or endogenous USF). In the other study a purified basal system was used. In such systems high concentrations of both DNA template and factors allows the requirement for activator to be bypassed. It is possible that this system has also bypassed the requirement for ATP to open the DNA. Alternatively, the abortive initiation product observed in that system might result from the α-amanitin-resistant process described here at the E4 promoter and previously at the adeno major late promoter. The process that produces this product is not known, but an undefined activity associated with purified RNA polymerase II has been reported to produce such products on poly(dA•dT) templates (de Mercoyrol et al., 1989). The data also indicate that neither DNA supercoiling nor the activity that phosphorylates the polymerase C-terminal domain is required for first bond formation. Of these the lack of requirement for polymerase phosphorylation is of greater interest because it has been proposed to affect the transition from preinitiation complex to elongation complex (Laybourn and Dahmus, 1989; Lu et al., 1991; Payne et al., 1989; Usheva et al., 1992). Studies of activated transcription have shown that the CTD phosphorylation inhibitor H8 depresses transcription levels.3 In the same system studied here, transcription was inhibited by H8, but open complex formation was not inhibited, suggesting that CTD phosphorylation can facilitate a step after open complex formation. The current observation is that H8 also does not inhibit formation of the first bond of the mRNA, and thus we infer that the step that is facilitated by CTD phosphorylation occurs after formation of the first bond of the mRNA. As discussed elsewhere, this may occur by giving assistance to initiated polymerases in moving out of the initial transcribed region. The data are also relevant to abortive initiation, both as an assay for first bond formation and as a phenomenon that might occur during normal transcription initiation. The experiments show that abortive initiation is strongly suppressed when all nucleoside triphosphates required for elongation are present. This observation suggests that abortive initiation is probably a relatively infrequent event during normal productive transcription initiation at the activated E4 promoter. This is consistent with a prior report that showed that allowing extension of the abortive initiation product by a single nucleotide at the adeno major late promoter leads to a reduction in signal (Luse and Jacob, 1987). In addition, repeated attempts (as in Fig. 6) have failed to detect significant amounts of longer products when nucleotides that allow elongation are present (but our experiments use only 10 ng of DNA/sample). This suggests that such longer RNAs do not accumulate in very high amounts as products of a reiterative abortive initiation reaction at this promoter. It has been reported that mutations that weaken a promoter can lead to increases in the amounts of short RNA products, including ones longer than trinucleotide (Jacob et al., 1994). Thus there appear to be cases where abortive initiation may occur during normal productive initiation, but there is not yet an example of this at a strong promoter. Taken together with other data, a view of the initiation pathway can be developed. Closed preinitiation complexes assemble in response to activators, and then the DNA within them is opened by ATP hydrolysis. The first bond of the mRNA can then form and then several more bonds. Further extension of the transcript is stimulated by the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the polymerase. At some point the polymerase clears the promoter, allowing entry of a new polymerase for reinitiation. Further challenges include testing this model and determining whether there are important promoter-dependent variations within it."
