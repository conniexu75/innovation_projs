https://openalex.org/W1991516151,"Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have ""more""; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly. The discriminative ability of the younger children shows that the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than previously acknowledged."

The visual information from a single letter decays in about 1.5 seconds if the task provides little incentive for preservation."

https://openalex.org/W2046971557,"The majority of ganglion cells in the retina of goldfish have receptive fields organized so that the cells respond particularly to simultaneous contrasts of color. The receptive fields are concentrically arranged. If the cell is excited by red light in the center, then it will also be excited by green light in the periphery, and inhibited by green light in the center or red light in the periphery. The occurrence of this arrangement and the reverse is about equal. The receptive field is much larger than had previously been thought."

https://openalex.org/W1995660032,"For the female to be normally responsive to the display of wing vibrations by males, the arista and funiculus of the female's antenna must be intact and able to move freely. The arista probably acts as a sail, twisting the funiculus and thus stimulating units of Johnston's organ at its base."

https://openalex.org/W1970363840,"The volatile compound from oak leaves which stimulates the female polyphemus moth to release her sex pheromone has been isolated and identified as trans-2-hexenal. Although leaves of other food plants contain trans-2-hexenal, they also release masking odors which block the activity of the hexenal."
https://openalex.org/W2041646647,Pigeons that were reinforced for pecking at a single-wavelength responded to nearby wavelengths with lower rates. Response rates indicated the pigeons' certainty that the reinforced stimulus was present. The ratings yielded receiver operating characteristic functions that approximated straight lines on a double probability plot.

https://openalex.org/W2015962090,"Extracellular action potentials were recorded from units in the preoptic area of the brain of the Australian blue-tongued skink (Tiliqua scincoides) during periods of local heating and cooling of the brain (20 degrees to 36 degrees C) with water-perfused thermodes. In this temperature range most spontaneously firing neurons were temperature-insensitive, but eight showed sensitivity to the thermal stimulus. Five warm neurons increased their activity when the brain temperature was raised, and three cold neurons showed increased activity with fall in temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2067817963,"A factor inhibitory to sodium transport exists in the sweat of patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. When the duct system of the rat parotid was perfused with sweat from patients, marked inhibition of sodium reabsorption was observed. Perfusion with sweat from normal subjects caused no change in sodium reabsorption. The factor thus demonstrated may be responsible for the increased sodium concentrations in the sweat of patients with cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2069462249,"Infective larvae of the rat lungworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis, presumed cause of human eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, are shed in mucus exuded by naturally infected Malayan slugs (Microparmarion malayanus). Larvae passed by slug hosts were recovered from lettuce and produced normal infection in white rats. Lettuce sold in the local public market also yielded small numbers of infective larvae. Experimental evidence from rats suggests that the local human population, exposed to repeated low-level infections, may become immunized against the rare massive exposure and against clinical disease that might otherwise result after ingestion of heavily infected raw mollusks."

https://openalex.org/W1971463468,The gamete-shedding substance obtained from the radial nerves induces spawning when it is applied to the gonads of mature starfish in vivo and in vitro. A substance that inhibits the action of this spawning factor is present in both ovary and testis; it has been isolated from testis of Asterina pectinifera and chemically identified as L-glutamic acid.
https://openalex.org/W2141001052,"Crude protein extracts were subjected to disk electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The pattern obtained showed a fast and slow series of bands. In the fast series, the eight species of wheat of the Emmer group gave virtually identical eight-band patterns, and the four species of the Timopheevi group gave nearly identical six- or seven-band patterns. The groups consistently differed with respect to four bands. Two of these differences were attributable to the A genome."

https://openalex.org/W2010890962,"The absorption of amino acids from jejunal loops was suppressed in anesthetized rats treated previously with 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms of actinomycin D per gram of body weight. The absorption of the acidic, neutral, and basic amino acids showed selective differences in response that were relative to the degree of inhibition and to the time interval required to demonstrate actinomycin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2091129293,"Adult cats were trained to discriminate between erect and inverted triangles after simultaneous ablation of cortical areas 17, 18, and most of 19 of both hemispheres. Postoperative training proceeded through a graded series of similar triangle pairs in which the members of each pair were equated for luminous flux."

https://openalex.org/W2042431716,"The hollow stems of wet-meadow and bog plants often contain relatively large amounts of carbon dioxide. The internal carbon dioxide apparently originates from respiration of root and stem cells. Some of this carbon dioxide is fixed photosynthetically by stem tissues and is thus recycled within the plant. Such internal stem photosynthesis would be advantageous, particularly in the early stages of growth in cold, wet, high-altitude environments."
https://openalex.org/W1994091168,"Retention of a T-maze task by adults of the species Tenebrio molitor was facilitated by exposure to 1.7Â°C. The facilitation effect was seen after 1, 3, 4, or 5 days of retention, but is was reversed after 2 days. The increment from day 2 to day 5 was termed ""reminiscence."" That these effects represented alterations in memory and not nonspecific motivational factors was determined by requiring another group of beetles to reverse their learning of the original task. Since reversal performance was inversely related to relearning, it was concluded that ""reminiscence"" represented alterations in memory. A multistage memory mechanism in the beetle was postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2024342728,9-Ethylhypoxanthine and 5-fluorouracil form a 1 : 1 crystalline complex. The structure of this complex has been solved by x-ray diffraction analysis. The molecules crystallize in a monoclinic lattice and form a sheet structure in which pairs of fluorouracil molecules are held together by two hydrogen bonds. The 9-ethylhypoxanthine residues fill up the rest of the molecular sheet by forming single hydrogen bonds with each uracil pair.

https://openalex.org/W2068898572,"The inhibition of growth of cotton seedlings (Gossypium hirsutum, var. Stardel) varied diurnally to applications of three herbicides [1,1-dimethyl-3-(alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluoro-m-tolyl) urea, 3',4'-dichloro-2-methacrylamide, and ethyl-N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate], but not to a fourth [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1, 1-dimethylurea]. Inhibition was strongest when the plants were treated at about daybreak. The rhythmic response was apparently not endogenously controlled, since most of the diurnal effect was lost under conditions of constant light and temperature."

Four subjects, 0.06 percent, had the G-hemoglobin variant in addition to normal hemoglobin A. Hemoglobin E, known in numerous groups from Southeast Asia and the variant most frequently seen in Chinese subjects, was not found among the Koreans we tested."

https://openalex.org/W2031432908,Optical activity differentiating the flowing and nonflowing amoebic cytoplasm was detected. This evidence indicates molecular alignment in the flow stream and can be used to provide data on the direction of alignment. The results were obtained by utilizing a dynamic polarized-light detection system which is sensitive only to specimens which possess a preferred axis.

https://openalex.org/W1977212667,"The process values of university research are important in the context of several significant social and economic trends in American life. These values are being taken into account in the design and administration of federal programs. Federal programs to support these values should be distinguished from programs to support the product values of research. Failure to distinguish between these two types of programs will lead to a further dilution of quality in programs designed to advance science as a legitimate end in itself. The scientific community can best protect its own interests by helping federal agencies and universities and colleges develop a funding system to support the process values of university research on a cooperative, regional basis."

https://openalex.org/W2000162206,IT has been shown that mice thymectomized just after birth develop hyperplasia of the reticuloendothelial cells and increased phagocytic activity as measured by the clearance of colloidal carbon from the blood1â3. Experiments carried out with repeated injections of large doses of carbon also showed increased granulopectic activity in thymectomized rats4.

https://openalex.org/W2002384915,"IN a recent communication, Davies and Muir1 pointed out that the experimental results from six independent studies of the retention of particles in the human respiratory system fall into two groups, the results of one group indicating higher values for the deposition than the other. They have attempted to explain this difference by suggesting that in two of these investigations2,3 errors were introduced by the experimental method, whereby the exhaled air was sampled continuously, including during the inhalation period. They said that there was an inaccuracy because the last part of the exhaled air, which had penetrated deeper into the lungs, contained fewer particles than the average. This may be so, but Davies and Muir give a false estimate of the magnitude of the error and do not account for the difference between the two groups of results."
https://openalex.org/W2030568568,"THE metabolism and mode of action of nitriles, such as Î²-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), that cause osteolathyrism in rats and other animals are far from being understood. Lalich1 has shown that after injection into rats of BAPN labelled in the cyano position with carbon-14, 80â90 per cent of the radioactive material was eliminated in the urine within 20 h. About 40 per cent of the activity was in the form of unchanged BAPN and 20â30 per cent could be recovered as cyanoacetic acid. Lalich also found that cyanoacetic acid had no lathyrogenic effect when fed to young rats and suggested that it was probably a detoxication product of BAPN."
