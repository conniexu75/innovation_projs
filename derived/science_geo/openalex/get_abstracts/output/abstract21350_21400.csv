https://openalex.org/W2103256993,"Charcot-Marie-tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) was localized by genetic mapping to a 3 cM interval on human chromosome 17p. DNA markers within this interval revealed a duplication that is completely linked and associated with CMT1A. The duplication was demonstrated in affected individuals by the presence of three alleles at a highly polymorphic locus, by dosage differences at RFLP alleles, and by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA from patients of different ethnic origins showed a novel SacII fragment of 500 kb associated with CMT1A. A severely affected CMT1A offspring from a mating between two affected individuals was demonstrated to have this duplication present on each chromosome 17. We have demonstrated that failure to recognize the molecular duplication can lead to misinterpretation of marker genotypes for affected individuals, identification of false recombinants, and incorrect localization of the disease locus."

https://openalex.org/W2148018436,"Small (100-260 kb), nested deletions were characterized in DNA from two unrelated patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Three candidate genes located within the deleted region were ascertained and a previous candidate gene, MCC, was shown to be located outside the deleted region. One of the new genes contained sequence identical to SRP19, the gene coding for the 19 kd component of the ribosomal signal recognition particle. The second, provisionally designated DP1 (deleted in polyposis 1), was found to be transcribed in the same orientation as MCC. Two other cDNAs, DP2 and DP3, were found to overlap, forming a single gene, DP2.5, that is transcribed in the same orientation as SRP19."
https://openalex.org/W2025097191,"Intercellular Ca2+ signaling in primary cultures of glial cells was investigated with digital fluorescence video imaging. Mechanical stimulation of a single cell induced a wave of increased [Ca2+]i that was communicated to surrounding cells. This was followed by asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations in some cells. Similar communicated Ca2+ responses occurred in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, despite an initial decrease in [Ca2+]i in the stimulated cell. Mechanical stimulation in the presence of glutamate induced a typical communicated Ca2+ wave through cells undergoing asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations in response to glutamate. The coexistence of communicated Ca2+ waves and asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations suggests distinct mechanisms for intra- and intercellular Ca2+ signaling. This intercellular signaling may coordinate cooperative glial function."

https://openalex.org/W2143046795,"mu opioids, such as morphine and certain enkephalin analogs, are known to modulate glutamate-evoked activity in dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord and caudal brain stem. Yet the molecular mechanism by which this modulation occurs is not understood. We examined the interactions between glutamate and a selective mu opioid receptor agonist, D-Ala2-MePhe4-Gly-ol5-enkephalin (DAGO), in spinal trigeminal neurons in thin medullary slices of rats. DAGO caused a sustained increase in glutamate-activated currents that are mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Intracellularly applied protein kinase C (PKC) mimics the effect of DAGO, and a specific PKC inhibitor interrupts the sustained potentiation produced by DAGO. Thus, PKC plays a key role in mediating the action of mu opioid peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1997727729,"Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a model of synaptic plasticity in which conjunctive stimulation of parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs to a Purkinje neuron induces a persistent depression of the parallel fiber-Purkinje neuron synapse. We report that an analogous phenomenon may be elicited in the cultured mouse Purkinje neuron when iontophoretic glutamate application and depolarization of the Purkinje neurons are substituted for parallel fiber and climbing fiber stimulation, respectively. The induction of LTD in these cerebellar cultures requires activation of both ionotropic (AMPA) and metabotropic quisqualate receptors, together with depolarization in the presence of external Ca2+. This postsynaptic alteration is manifest as a depression of glutamate or AMPA currents, but not aspartate or NMDA currents. These results strengthen the contention that the expression of cerebellar LTD is at least in part postsynaptic and provide evidence that activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic quisqualate receptors are necessary for LTD induction."
https://openalex.org/W1991615434,"Molecular cloning of the t(10;14)(q24;q11) recurrent breakpoint of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has demonstrated a transcript for the candidate gene TCL3. Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11. The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus. HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells. This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2034754449,"Exposure of rat retinal cultures to HIV-1 coat protein gp120 for several minutes increases [Ca2+]i in approximately half of the ganglion cells; this effect is associated with delayed-onset neuronal injury, similar to that previously reported in NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity. Here we show that NMDA antagonists can prevent both the rise in [Ca2+]; and subsequent neuronal damage engendered by 20 pM gp120. However, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that gp 120 does not directly evoke an NMDA-like response or enhance glutamate/NMDA-activated currents. Moreover, complete protection from gp120-induced [Ca2+]i increases and neurotoxicity is afforded by incubation with glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, which breaks down endogenous glutamate as verified by HPLC. Since, under standard conditions in these cultures, neither glutamate nor a low picomolar concentration of gp120 is deleterious on its own, our results suggest that their neurotoxicity is synergistic."
https://openalex.org/W2053558740,The dorsal blastopore lip of the early Xenopus laevis gastrula can organize a complete secondary body axis when transplanted to another embryo. A search for potential gene regulatory components specifically expressed in the organizer was undertaken that resulted in the identification of four types of complementary DNAs from homeobox-containing genes that fulfill this criterion. The most abundant of these encodes a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster anterior morphogen bicoid. The other three are also homologous to developmentally significant Drosophila genes. These four genes may participate in the regulation of the developmental potential of the organizer.

https://openalex.org/W2127721047,"In vitro refolding of the monomeric mitochondrial enzyme, rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase; EC 2.8.1.1) is facilitated by molecular chaperonins. The four components: two proteins from Escherichia coli, chaperonin 60 (groEL) and chaperonin 10 (groES), MgATP, and K+, are necessary for the in vitro folding of rhodanese. These were previously shown to be necessary for the in vitro folding of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase at temperatures in excess of 25 degrees C (Viitanen, P. V., Lubben, T. H., Reed, J., Goloubinoff, P., O'Keefe, D. P., and Lorimer, G. H. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 5665-5671). The labile folding intermediate, rhodanese-I, which rapidly aggregates at 37 degrees C in the absence of the chaperonins, can be stabilized by forming a binary complex with chaperonin 60. The discharge of the binary chaperonin 60-rhodanese-I complex, results in the formation of active rhodanese, and requires the presence of chaperonin 10. Optimal refolding is associated with a K(+)-dependent hydrolysis of ATP. At lower protein concentrations and 25 degrees C, where aggregation is reduced, a fraction of the rhodanese refolds to an active form in the absence of the chaperonins. This spontaneous refolding can be arrested by chaperonin 60. There is some refolding (approximately equal to 20%) when ATP is replaced by nonhydrolyzable analogs, but there is no refolding in the presence of ADP or AMP. ATP analogs may interfere with the interaction of rhodanese-I with the chaperonins. Nondenaturing detergents facilitate rhodanese refolding by interacting with exposed hydrophobic surfaces of folding intermediates and thereby prevent aggregation (Tandon, S., and Horowitz, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15615-15618). The chaperonin proteins appear to play a similar role in as much as they can replace the detergents. Consistent with this view, chaperonin 60, but not chaperonin 10, binds 2-3 molecules of the hydrophobic fluorescent reporter, 1,1'-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-S,5'-disulfonic acid, indicating the presence of hydrophobic surfaces on chaperonin 60. The number of bound probe molecules is reduced to 1-2 molecules when chaperonin 10 and MgATP are added. The results support a model in which chaperonins facilitate folding, at least in part, by interacting with partly folded intermediates, thus preventing the interactions of hydrophobic surfaces that lead to aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W1982952723,"Mutations that cause pituitary dwarfism in the mouse reside in the gene encoding the transcription factor growth hormone factor 1 (GHF1 or pit1). These dwarf mice (dw and dwJ) are deficient in growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) synthesis and exhibit pituitary hypoplasia, suggesting a stem cell defect. With antisense oligonucleotide technology, a cell culture model of this genetic defect was developed. Specific inhibition of GHF1 synthesis by complementary oligonucleotides led to a marked decrease in GH and PRL expression and to a marked decrease in proliferation of somatotrophic cell lines. These results provide direct evidence that the homeodomain protein GHF1 is required not only for the establishment and maintenance of the differentiated phenotype but for cell proliferation as well."

https://openalex.org/W2041849975,"A complementary DNA, Tes-1, of a novel homeodomain protein has been cloned, and its pattern of expression has been characterized. It is a structural homolog of Distal-less, a homeodomain-encoding gene in D. melanogaster. Its expression is developmentally regulated and is limited to structures in the head. Within the central nervous system of the midgestation mouse embryo, it is expressed exclusively in the ventral forebrain. It is likely that Tes-1 plays a regulatory role in the development of this complex neural structure."

https://openalex.org/W1504879193,"The laminin-nidogen complex, a major component of basement membranes, incorporates [3H]putrescine and monodansylcadaverine in the presence of guinea pig liver transglutaminase. Label was detected in nidogen in the isolated, as well as in the complexed form, but not in laminin. The incorporation proceeds in a time-dependent manner at a rate similar to that achieved with N,N-dimethylcasein, a well characterized transglutaminase substrate. Saturation of incorporation site(s), as well as comparison with the incorporation level in reference proteins, indicated the presence of one high affinity amine acceptor site in nidogen. Electron microscopy of the reaction products showed that the laminin-nidogen complexes become stabilized in a head-to-head arrangement, characteristic of Ca(2+)-induced self-aggregation. Indirect immunofluorescence and detection of transglutaminase activity on unfixed cryosections revealed an extracellular distribution of tissue transglutaminase. Intensive staining was observed in collagen-rich connective tissue. Codistribution with nidogen was not a ubiquitous feature, but was observed in many locations."

https://openalex.org/W1595188935,"It is believed that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an energy-dependent drug efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug resistant (MDR) cells. In this study, we investigated whether azidopine, a photoactive dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is transported by P-gp in MDR Chinese hamster lung cells, DC-3F/VCRd-5L, and whether its binding site(s) on P-gp are distinct from those of Vinca alkaloids and cyclosporins. The efflux of azidopine from MDR cells was energy-dependent and inhibited by the cytotoxic agent vinblastine (VBL). Cyclosporin A (CsA), a modulator of MDR, also increased azidopine accumulation in MDR cells by decreasing the energy-dependent efflux of azidopine. P-gp in these cells was the only protein specifically bound to [3H]azidopine in photoaffinity experiments. The specific photoaffinity labeling of P-gp by [3H]azidopine was inhibited by CsA, SDZ 33-243, nonradioactive azidopine, and VBL with median concentrations (IC50) of 0.5, 0.62, 1.7, and 25 microM, respectively. The equilibrium binding of azidopine to plasma membranes of MDR variant DC-3F/VCRd-5L cells showed a single class of specific binding sites having a dissociation constant of 1.20 microM and a maximum binding capacity of 4.47 nmol/mg of protein. Kinetic analysis indicated that the inhibitory effect of VBL and CsA on azidopine binding to plasma membranes of MDR cells was noncompetitive, indicating that azidopine binds to P-gp at a binding site(s) different from the binding site(s) of these drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1537855747,"Cell-cell adhesion is critical in the generation of immunologic responses and is dependent upon expression of a variety of cell surface receptors. While intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a specific receptor for lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, is constitutively expressed by some cell types, its de novo or increased expression by various cells has been associated with the initiation of inflammatory responses and appears to be transcriptionally regulated. The 5' region of the human ICAM-1 gene has been cloned and both structurally and functionally analyzed. A 17.3-kilobase genomic clone containing three exonal regions encoding the N-terminal third of the ICAM-1 protein was isolated. A 2.05-kilobase subclone, containing the 5' most exon, was utilized to determine an interferon-gamma-induced transcription initiation site via primer extension and S1 nuclease protection assays. Analysis of the 5'-flanking region revealed consensus sequences for appropriately located basal promoter elements, as well as numerous potential cis-acting enhancer elements. When subcloned into a reporter gene construct, the putative promoter subregion functioned as a potent promoter. However, in accord with biologically observed expression of ICAM-1 in specific cell types, when additional 5'-flanking sequences were included in reporter gene constructs, tissue appropriate repression of transcription was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1729873003,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that differences in subtype-specific ligand binding between alpha 2 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors are largely determined by the seventh hydrophobic domain. Here, we report that a single amino acid substitution (Phe412----Asn) in the seventh hydrophobic domain of the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor reduces affinity for the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine by 350-fold and increases affinity for beta antagonist alprenolol by 3000-fold. The affinity of this mutant receptor alpha 2F----N for several alpha and beta adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists was determined. Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists containing an oxygen atom linking the amino side chain with the aromatic ring bound to alpha 2F----N with high affinity, while the beta receptor antagonist sotalol, which lacks this oxygen, bound with low affinity. These data suggest that the Asn residue is involved in conferring specificity for binding to a specific class of beta receptor antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2123705849,"Prolonged incubation times for experimental scrapie in I/LnJ mice are dictated by a dominant gene linked to the prion protein gene (Prn-p). Transgenic mice were analyzed to discriminate between an effect of the I/LnJ Prn-pb allele and a distinct incubation time locus designated Prn-i. Paradoxically, 4 independent Prn-pb transgenic mouse lines had scrapie incubation times shorter than nontransgenic controls, instead of the anticipated prolonged incubation periods. Aberrant or overexpression of the Prn-pb transgenes may dictate abbreviated incubation times, masking genuine Prn-p/Prn-i congruence; alternatively, a discrete Prn-i gene lies adjacent to Prn-p."
https://openalex.org/W41965769,"We screened a panel of 103 human lung cancer cell lines for the presence of point mutations at codons 12, 13 or 61 of the human K-, H- and N-ras genes, using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), created through mismatched primers during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA. We found ras mutations in 22/61 (36%) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, predominantly in K-ras codon 12. Identical mutations were present in uncultured tumor materials corresponding to 11 cell lines containing mutated ras genes. ras mutations were found not only in adenocarcinoma cell lines (9/32, 28%), but also in cell lines derived from other types of NSCLC (13/29, 45%). In contrast, none of 37 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and five extra-pulmonary small-cell cancer cell lines had ras mutations. ras mutations were not correlated with sex of the patients, tumor extent, prior therapy status or in vitro culture time. G to T or A to T transversions were the most common base substitutions, occurring in codons 12 and 61 respectively. We conclude that ras mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of NSCLC but are not involved in SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W1525347874,"In addition to its known substrate activity with p-nitrophenyl beta-cellobioside, the exoglucanase from Cellulomonas fimi has been shown to utilize substituted phenyl beta-glucosides as substrates, of which the best is 2',4'-dinitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. The enzyme can be inactivated by treatment with 2',4'-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranoside, by trapping of the covalent intermediate in catalysis, as has been shown for a beta-glucosidase (Withers, S.G., and Street, I.P. (1988) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 8551-8553). The intermediate formed is stable but can undergo turnover in the presence of cellobiose, reactivating the enzyme by transglycosylation. Using a tritium-labeled inactivator it has been possible to isolate and sequence a radiolabeled peptide from this enzyme, and the active site nucleophile has been identified as glutamic acid residue 274. This glutamic acid residue and its sequentially proximal amino acids are absolutely conserved in the homologous family F of cellulases."
https://openalex.org/W1597229078,"Fibronectin is a cell-adhesive protein comprised of three types of repeating homologous sequences, I, II, and III (Petersen, T.E., Thogersen, H.C., Skorstengaard, K., Vibe-Pedersen, K., Sahl, P., Sottrup-Jensen, L., and Magnusson, S. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 137-141). The amino-terminal portion of fibronectin is comprised of five type I modules and mediates assembly of dimeric soluble fibronectin into insoluble fibrils by cultured fibroblasts, binding and cross-linking of fibronectin to Staphylococcus aureus, and binding and cross-linking of fibronectin to fibrin. It is not known whether these binding activities require individual type I modules, several modules, or all five modules. To answer this question, we generated recombinant truncated fibronectin molecules with deletions of or mutations in the amino-terminal type I modules. Binding to cellular fibronectin assembly sites and S. aureus required all five type I modules. In contrast, proteins with deletions of type I modules interacted well with fibrin."
https://openalex.org/W1600225469,"We have used a monoclonal antibody affinity column to purify from HeLa cells a protein of molecular weight 170,000 (designated pp170) which we previously identified as a nucleotide-sensitive microtubule-binding protein (Rickard, J. E., and Kreis, T. E. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 1623-1633). We show here that the affinity-purified pp170 binds directly to taxol-polymerized tubulin. This association is not affected directly by MgATP. Addition of MgATP can, however, inhibit binding of pp170 to microtubules in the presence of microtubule-binding proteins from HeLa cells. This effect of MgATP correlates with phosphorylation of pp170 by a microtubule-associated kinase. Potato acid phosphatase dephosphorylates the pp170 and restores the ability of pp170 to bind to microtubules. Furthermore, binding of pp170 to microtubules in a high speed supernatant extract is inhibited by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, consistent with an inhibitory effect of pp170 phosphorylation on microtubule binding. In vivo, pp170 is phosphorylated on serine residues, with a half-life for the phosphate groups of approximately 2 h. Depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole abolishes incorporation of 32P into the protein, apparently by increasing the rate of its dephosphorylation. Stabilization of microtubules with taxol reduces the rate of 32P incorporation into pp170 by approximately 50%, but has no significant effect on phosphate loss. These data establish that pp170 is a microtubule-binding protein, and that the microtubule interaction is inhibited by phosphorylation of pp170. The sensitivity of the in vivo phosphorylation state of pp170 to microtubule-active drugs suggests that this posttranslational modification may be an important regulator of the interaction of pp170 with microtubules in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2147073510,"In the frog Xenopus laevis, signals from the mesoderm divert part of the ectoderm from an epidermal to a neural fate. In the course of neural induction, the neurectoderm also acquires anterior-posterior polarity. In this report, the early expression of two genes, XIHbox6 and the neurofilament gene XIF6, is examined. The pattern of expression of the two genes seen in the tailbud embryo develops progressively over a 4 hr period following gastrulation. Physiological concentrations of retinoic acid can mimic this effect in isolated embryonic explants, consistent with the involvement of retinoic acid, or a closely related molecule, in localizing gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube."
https://openalex.org/W1603672218,"A partially agonistic monoclonal antibody, 4D5, known to bind to the extracellular domain of p185HER2 and shown to inhibit long term growth of p185HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, was used to study signal transduction and phosphotyrosyl protein substrates associated with this receptor. Normal breast epithelial cells and breast carcinoma cells expressing low levels of p185HER2 were not affected by 4D5. HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells (BT-474 and SK-Br-3) exposed to 4D5 exhibited rapid phosphorylation of both p185HER2 and an associated 56-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein (ptyr56). Paralleling the 4D5- stimulated phosphorylation of p185HER2 and ptyr56 was a 5-10-fold induction of c-fos mRNA and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity and a 2-fold induction of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3'-kinase activity. The increased phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity immunoprecipitated with p185HER2 and also co-eluted with ptyr56 from an antiphosphotyrosine immunoaffinity column. These results indicate that short term (less than 6 h) 4D5 activation of p185HER2 in overexpressing breast cancer cells produces agonistic-like signaling typical of homologous tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor. The data also suggest that ptyr56 represents a novel phosphorylated substrate associated with 4D5-stimulated p185HER2."
https://openalex.org/W1483218234,"The single human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene generates four different mRNA species through alternative splicing events. TH-1 and TH-2 mRNAs are expressed mostly in the brain. We have produced large amounts of the corresponding proteins in Escherichia coli to analyze their respective molecular characteristics. The polypeptides have molecular weights similar to those of TH expressed in Xenopus oocytes and react with antibodies to TH. The two isoforms were purified with a purity of 90% using a three-step procedure. The phosphorylation sites have been determined in the two isoforms after labeling with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-PK II). In both isoforms, Ser-40 was found to be phosphorylated by PKA, and Ser-19 and Ser-40 were found to be phosphorylated by CaM-PK II. The putative phosphorylation site generated by alternative splicing (Ser-31) was phosphorylated specifically by CaM-PK II in TH-2 only. The kinetic properties of the two isoforms in the presence of various concentrations of the substrate (tyrosine) and of the natural cofactor [6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin) were also analyzed. TH produced in E. coli is unphosphorylated but nevertheless active. At 50 microM tyrosine and 300 microM (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, the specific activities of TH-1 and TH-2 are 1300 and 620 nmol of dihydroxyphenylalanine/min/mg, respectively. Phosphorylation of TH-1 and TH-2 by PKA activates both isoenzymes as shown by the increase in the affinity for the cofactor. No changes in kinetic parameters of the isoenzymes were observed after phosphorylation by CaM-PK II. Dopamine was found to inhibit both TH isoenzymes to the same extent as shown by their similar Ki values for dopamine. These values were increased after phosphorylation of each enzyme by PKA. Unlike TH-1, phosphorylation of TH-2 by CaM-PK II resulted in an increase of the Ki value for dopamine. This property may be related to the presence of the additional phosphorylated residue in TH-2 isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1502037771,"Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.424.11, NEP) is a membrane-bound zinc-metallopeptidase. The substrate specificity and catalytic activity of NEP resemble those of thermolysin, a bacterial zinc-metalloprotease. Comparison of the primary structure of both enzymes suggests that several amino acids present in the active site of thermolysin are also found in NEP. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding the NEP sequence, we have already shown that His residues 583 and 587 are two of the three zinc ligands. In order to identify the third zinc ligand, we have substituted Val or Asp for Glu616 or Glu646. Val616 NEP showed the same kinetic parameters as the non-mutated NEP. In contrast, the mutant Val646 NEP was almost completely devoid of catalytic activity and unable to bind the tritiated inhibitor [3H]N-[2(R,S)-3-hydroxyaminocarbonyl-2-benzyl-1-oxypropyl]gl ycine, the binding of which is dependent on the presence of the zinc ion. Replacing Glu for Asp at position 646 conserved the negative charge, and the mutant enzyme exhibited the same Km value as the non-mutated enzyme, but kCat was decreased to less than 3% of the value of the non-mutated enzyme. When compared to the non-mutated enzyme Asp646 NEP showed a higher susceptibility to chelating agents, but bound the tritiated inhibitor with the same affinity. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that Glu646 of NEP is the third zinc-coordinating residue and is equivalent to Glu166 in thermolysin."

https://openalex.org/W1600340506,"In vitro refolding of the urea-unfolded, monomeric, mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfur-transferase; EC 2.8.1.1) is facilitated by the chaperonin proteins cpn60 and cpn10 from Escherichia coli at 37 degrees C, but the refolding is strongly inhibited at 10 degrees C. In contrast, the unassisted refolding of rhodanese is efficient at 10 degrees C, but the refolding efficiency decreases as the temperature is raised. These observations provided two measures of the cpn60-rhodanese complex. Thus, we monitored either 1) the cpn60-dependent inhibition of spontaneous folding at 10 degrees C or 2) the recovery of active rhodanese in the complete chaperonin system at 25 degrees C, after first forming a cpn60-rhodanese complex at 10 degrees C. These procedures minimized the aggregation of interactive folding intermediates that tend to overestimate the apparent number of cpn60 14-mers in determining the stoichiometry of protein-cpn60 14-mer interactions. Both procedures used here gave results that were consistent with there being 1 rhodanese binding site/cpn60 tetradecamer. This stoichiometry is significantly less than might be expected from the fact that cpn60 is composed of 14 identical subunits, and it may indicate that rhodanese interacts with a restricted region that is formed when the cpn60 tetradecamer is assembled. The ability to stabilize chaperonin-protein complexes that can subsequently be reactivated will aid studies of the mode of action of the ubiquitous chaperonin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1599879564,"Tyrosine hydroxylase was maximally phosphorylated by protein kinase C, with a stoichiometry of 0.43 mol of phosphate/mol of tyrosine hydroxylase subunit at Ser40, and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, with stoichiometries of 0.43 mol/mol at Ser40 and 0.76 mol/mol at Ser19, respectively, without undergoing any significant direct activation. In contrast, the enzyme was maximally phosphorylated with a stoichiometry of 0.78 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit at Ser40 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which resulted in a large activation of the enzyme (about 3-fold activation under the assay conditions). Incubation of the enzyme, which had previously been maximally phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, with protein kinase C under phosphorylating conditions resulted in no additional incorporation of phosphate into the enzyme, suggesting that both protein kinases phosphorylated Ser40 of the same subunits of the enzyme. Since tyrosine hydroxylase is thought to be composed of four identical subunits, the results may indicate that calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or protein kinase C phosphorylates only two of the four subunits of the enzyme at Ser40 without affecting the enzyme activity and that cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates Ser40 of all four subunits of the enzyme molecule, causing a marked activation. Based on a linear relationship between phosphorylation and the resulting activation of the enzyme by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, possible mechanisms for the activation of the enzyme by the protein kinase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1552509352,"Abstract Addition of toxic heavy metal ions (Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+) to hemin-supplemented rabbit reticulocyte lysate brings about the activation of the heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha kinase (HRI) and the inhibition of protein chain initiation. In this report we examined the effects of monothiol and dithiol compounds, metal ion-chelating agents, and metallothioneins (MT) on metal ion-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. The dithiol compounds dithiothreitol and 2,3-dimercaptopropane sulfonic acid prevented and relieved the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by Cd2+ and Hg2+ in hemin-supplemented lysates, but the monothiol compounds 2-mercaptoethanol, cysteamine, D-(-)penicillamine, and glutathione had no effect. The inhibition of protein synthesis caused by Cd2+ was reversed by the addition of excess EDTA but not by the addition of excess nitrilotriacetic acid. Toxic heavy metal ions inhibited the capacity of hemin-supplemented lysate to reduce disulfide bonds. Addition of excess EDTA to Cd(2+)-inhibited lysates restored the capacity of the lysate to reduce disulfide bonds and inhibited the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. MTs and their apoproteins (apoMTs) inhibited the activation of HRI and protected protein synthesis from inhibition by Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+. Addition of apoMTs to heavy metal ion-inhibited lysates restored the capacity of lysates to reduce disulfide bonds. The restoration of the lysate's thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase activity was accompanied by the inactivation of HRI and the resumption of protein synthesis, indicating that apoMTs can detoxify metal ions already bound to proteins. Several observations presented in this report suggest that the binding of metal ions to the alpha-domain of MT is responsible for the ability of MT to sequester bound metal in a non-toxic form. Addition of glucose 6-phosphate or NADPH had no effect on protein synthesis in metal ion-inhibited lysates, and NADPH concentrations in Cd(2+)-inhibited and hemin-supplemented control lysates were equivalent. The data suggest that the metal ions cause the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to vicinal sulfhydryl groups present in some critical protein(s), possibly the dithiols present in the active site of thioredoxin and (or) thioredoxin reductase, which leads to the activation of HRI."
https://openalex.org/W1523264176,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a type II membrane glycoprotein that is predominantly localized to the apical plasma membrane in various epithelial cells. In order to understand in more detail the biogenesis and sorting of DPPIV, the cDNA for rat DPPIV was inserted into a mammalian plasmid expression vector so that DPPIV expression was driven by a control region composed of the SV40 early promoter region fused to the enhancer of the Rous sarcoma virus. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with this construct were found to express the DPPIV protein. In these transfected cells, the majority of DPPIV was present on the apial cell surface. This observation suggests that the information for apical surface localization is inherent in the DPPIV molecule itself and that this sorting information is decipherable in the epithelial cells of a different species. DPPIV is transported efficiently from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus as assessed by pulse-chase experiments. Furthermore, evidence is presented which suggests that the majority of DPPIV is sorted intracellularly to the apical cell surface. The same protein has, however, been reported to be sorted by an indirect pathway through transcytosis from the basolateral to the apical cell surface in hepatocytes (Bartles, J.R., Feracci, H., M., Stinger, B., and Hubbard, A.L. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1241-1251). This study suggests that the same protein can take two different pathways in different cell types for its correct apical cell surface localization."
https://openalex.org/W1510072442,"Addition of triiodothyronine (T3) to chick-embryo hepatocytes in culture causes increased accumulations of malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and their mRNAs. H-8 and other protein kinase inhibitors inhibited the T3-induced accumulations of these lipogenic enzymes and their mRNAs but had no effect on the activities of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, enzymes not induced by T3 in chick-embryo hepatocytes. H-8 also had no effect on the activities of malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in hepatocytes not treated with T3. Synthesis of soluble protein, levels of mRNAs for beta-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and induction of metallothionein mRNA by Zn2+ were unaffected by H-8 at concentrations that inhibited the T3-induced accumulation of lipogenic enzymes and their mRNAs. H-8 inhibited T3-induced transcription of the genes for both malic enzyme and fatty acid synthase but had little effect on transcription of the beta-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes or on total RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei. H-8 also had no effect on binding of T3 to its nuclear receptor. In isolated nuclei, H-8 inhibited phosphorylation of total protein by 15-20%. Phosphorylation of only one major protein was consistently and substantially inhibited, indicating that the effect of H-8 was selective. These results suggest that on-going protein phosphorylation is required specifically for stimulation of transcription of the lipogenic genes by T3."
https://openalex.org/W1596611034,"Pheochromocytoma tyrosine hydroxylase was reported to have unusual catalytic properties, which might be unique to the tumor enzyme (Dix, T. A., Kuhn, D. M., and Benkovic, S. J. (1987) Biochemistry 24, 3354-3361). Two such properties, namely the apparent inability to hydroxylate phenylalanine and an unprecedented reactivity with hydrogen peroxide were investigated further in the present study. Tyrosine hydroxylase was purified to apparent homogeneity from cultured pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. The purified tumor enzyme was entirely dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) for the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and hydrogen peroxide could not substitute for the natural cofactor. Indeed, in the presence of BH4, increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide completely inhibited enzyme activity. The PC12 hydroxylase exhibited typical kinetics of tyrosine hydroxylation exhibited typical kinetics of tyrosine hydroxylation, both as a function of tyrosine (S0.5 Tyr = 15 microM) and BH4 (apparent Km BH4 = 210 microM). In addition, the enzyme catalyzed the hydroxylation of substantial amounts of phenylalanine to tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (apparent Km Phe = 100 microM). Phenylalanine did not inhibit the enzyme in the concentrations tested, whereas tyrosine showed typical substrate inhibition at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 microM. At higher substrate concentrations, the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation was equal to or exceeded that of tyrosine. Essentially identical results were obtained with purified tyrosine hydroxylase from pheochromocytoma PC18 cells. The data suggest that the tumor enzyme has the same substrate specificity and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide as tyrosine hydroxylase from other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1556619518,"The effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol on guanine nucleotide-dependent phospholipase C (PLC) activity was examined in turkey erythrocyte membranes prepared from [3H]inositol-labeled turkey erythrocytes. In the presence of guanosine 5'-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S]) isoproterenol caused a dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]InsP) formation. The activation of PLC by GTP[S] occurred after an initial lag period of 1-2 min and was followed by a sustained rate of [3H]InsP formation which remained linear for 4-5 min. Isoproterenol decreased the lag period for GTP[S]-induced [3H]InsP formation and increased PLC activity at all time points following this lag. Consequently, isoproterenol shifted the dose-response curve for GTP[S] to the left (10-fold) and increased the maximal response. The EC50 value for isoproterenol-induced activation of PLC was 104 +/- 17 nM. Isoproterenol also potentiated GTP-dependent PLC activity but was ineffective in stimulating the enzyme in the presence of AIF4-. The PLC activation by isoproterenol was completely inhibited by propanolol and atenolol but was unaffected by prazosin or yohimbine. Although GTP[S] and isoproterenol could increase cAMP formation in this membrane preparation, the isoproterenol-induced stimulation of PLC occurred in the absence of ATP and was independent of cAMP formation. Furthermore, addition of cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, or either the regulatory or catalytic subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase failed to stimulate [3H]InsP formation and had no effect on the responses elicited by GTP[S] and isoproterenol. Isoproterenol also stimulated [3H]InsP2 and [3H]InsP3 production in intact erythrocytes. Cholera toxin had no effect on [3H]InsP formation in the intact cells under conditions where it stimulated cAMP accumulation. In addition, the activation of PLC by GTP[S] and isoproterenol was unaffected in membranes prepared from cholera toxin-treated erythrocytes. These data demonstrate that stimulation of turkey erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol results in a direct activation of guanine nucleotide-dependent PLC."
https://openalex.org/W1501492581,"The density of the alpha 2A-adrenergic receptor in the HT29 cell line, a human colonic adenocarcinoma, increases when the cells are placed in fetal calf serum (FCS)-free culture medium and decreases again, in a concentration-dependent manner, when they are re-exposed to FCS. In an attempt to identify the FCS components responsible for this phenomenon, we examined the effect of insulin and of various growth factors on receptor expression. Incubation of HT29 cells with insulin resulted in a time- and dose-dependent lowering of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor number. The decrease of [3H] RX821002 binding sites after a 48-h period of treatment reached 70-75% with 170 nM insulin, and a half-maximal effect was observed at 2.6 nM. This value is in agreement with the EC50 of the hormone for stimulating the glycolytic activity of HT29 cells (8 nM) and is sufficiently low to indicate that the decrease of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor number is mediated through stimulation of insulin receptors. Direct quantification of [3H] UK14304 binding sites and the study of the inhibition of [3H]RX821002 binding by (-)-epinephrine indicated that the degree of receptor coupling to Gi protein was not affected when the receptor number was decreased by insulin treatment. The reduction in receptor number did result in an attenuation of the inhibitory effect of UK14304 on forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in a manner which was consistent with the existence of a large population of spare receptors in untreated cells. The action of insulin is not due to an accelerated rate of receptor degradation and can be mimicked by other growth factors (epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II) acting through stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors. RNase mapping experiments with a 0.35-kilobase riboprobe prepared from the human alpha 2 C10-adrenergic receptor gene demonstrated that the decrease of receptor number induced by the different treatments is a reflection of changes occurring at the level of its mRNA. The use of cycloheximide indicated that the effect of insulin on alpha 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA does not require protein synthesis. The half-life of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA measured after the addition of actinomycin D was unchanged by insulin which suggests that a decrease in the transcription rate is the predominant factor responsible for the observed regulation of receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W1484401753,"Abstract 30A5 preadipocytes, derived from 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts, can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes by hormone treatment. In this paper, we introduce a modified procedure to induce differentiation of 30A5 cells by pretreatment with cAMP for a brief period or by a nutrition deprivation pretreatment, followed by incubation in medium containing insulin. These procedures accelerate the differentiation of the preadipocytes, so that the cells are fully differentiated within 4 days instead of the 7-8 days normally required. This differentiation is accompanied by the early induction of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of long chain fatty acids. To analyze the relationship between cAMP and insulin action in the induction of ACC and cell differentiation, we identified the DNA sequences in promoter II of the ACC gene necessary for the action of insulin and cAMP. Chimeric genes between different fragments of the ACC promoter and the promoterless chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT) gene were constructed, and stable clones containing these chimeric genes were obtained. By analyzing the CAT activities in these stable clones, we established that insulin action in inducing ACC and cell differentiation requires prior treatment of cells with cAMP and the presence of specific DNA regions in the ACC promoter for cAMP action. Stable clones containing a chimeric gene which consists of DNA sequences in promoter II that are required for insulin action, thymidine kinase promoter, and the CAT gene did not respond to insulin. However, when the DNA sequences required for cAMP action were placed in this chimeric gene, it responded to insulin upon prior treatment of 30A5 cells with cAMP. Thus, cAMP and insulin, whose physiological actions generally appear to be antagonistic, are synergistically interacting in the induction of ACC and the differentiation of 30A5 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1509443024,"The peptide somatostatin (SRIF) exists as two different molecular species. In addition to the most common form, which is a 14-residue peptide, there is also a 14-amino acid amino-terminally extended form of the tetradecapeptide, SRIF-28. Both peptides are synthesized as larger precursors containing paired basic and monobasic amino acids at their processing sites, which, upon cleavage, generate either SRIF-14 or -28, respectively. In mammals a single prepro-SRIF molecule undergoes tissue-specific processing to generate the mature hormone whereas in some species of fish separate genes encode two distinct but homologous precursors prepro-SRIF-I and -II that give rise to SRIF-14 and -28, respectively. To investigate the molecular basis for differential processing of the prohormones we introduce their cDNAs into yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The signal peptides of both precursors were poorly recognized by the yeast endoplasmic reticulum translocation apparatus, consequently only low levels of SRIF peptides were synthesized. To circumvent this problem a chimeric precursor consisting of the alpha-factor signal peptide plus 30 residues of the proregion was fused to pro-SRIF-II. This fusion protein was efficiently transported through the yeast secretory pathway and processed to SRIF-28 exclusively, which is identical to the processing of the native precursor in pancreatic islet D-cells. Most significantly, cleavage of the precursor to SRIF-28 was independent of the Kex 2 endoprotease since processing occurred efficiently in a kex 2 mutant strain. We conclude that in addition to the Kex 2 protease, yeast possess a distinct prohormone converting enzyme with specificity toward monobasic processing sites."
