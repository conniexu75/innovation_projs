Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are associated with familial parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders. Although overexpressed PINK1 is neuroprotective, less is known about neuronal responses to loss of PINK1 function. We found that stable knockdown of PINK1 induced mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells, which was reversed by the reintroduction of an RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant plasmid for PINK1. Moreover, stable or transient overexpression of wild-type PINK1 increased mitochondrial interconnectivity and suppressed toxin-induced autophagy/mitophagy. Mitochondrial oxidant production played an essential role in triggering mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy in PINK1 shRNA lines. Autophagy/mitophagy served a protective role in limiting cell death, and overexpressing Parkin further enhanced this protective mitophagic response. The dominant negative Drp1 mutant inhibited both fission and mitophagy in PINK1-deficient cells. Interestingly, RNAi knockdown of autophagy proteins Atg7 and LC3/Atg8 also decreased mitochondrial fragmentation without affecting oxidative stress, suggesting active involvement of autophagy in morphologic remodeling of mitochondria for clearance. To summarize, loss of PINK1 function elicits oxidative stress and mitochondrial turnover coordinated by the autophagic and fission/fusion machineries. Furthermore, PINK1 and Parkin may cooperate through different mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysregulation is strongly implicated in Parkinson disease.

Parkinson disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that affects ∼1% of the population worldwide. The causes of sporadic cases are unknown, although mitochondrial or oxidative toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 3The abbreviations used are: 6-OHDA, 6-hydroxydopamine; AV, autophagic vacuole; Drp1, dynamin-related protein-1; Drp1-DN, dominant negative Drp1; LC3, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3; PD, Parkinson disease/parkinsonian disorder; PINK1, PTEN-induced kinase 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MnTBAP, manganese(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin. and rotenone reproduce features of the disease in animal and cell culture models (1Bove J.

Abnormalities in mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative stress are observed in cells and tissues from parkinsonian patients (2Hoepken H.H. Gispert S. Morales B. Wingerter O. Del Turco D.

Furthermore, mutations in parkinsonian genes affect oxidative stress response pathways and mitochondrial homeostasis (5Abeliovich A. Flint Beal M. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 1062-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis represents a major factor implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic and inherited parkinsonian disorders (PD). The PARK6 locus involved in autosomal recessive and early-onset PD encodes for PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) (6Valente E.M. Abou-Sleiman P.M. Caputo V. Muqit M.M. Harvey K. Gispert S. Ali Z.

PINK1 is a cytosolic and mitochondrially localized 581-amino acid serine/threonine kinase that possesses an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (6Valente E.M. Abou-Sleiman P.M. Caputo V.

The primary sequence also includes a putative transmembrane domain important for orientation of the PINK1 domain (8Zhou C. Huang Y. Shao Y. May J. Prou D. Perier C. Dauer W. Schon E.A. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of wild-type PINK1, but not its PD-associated mutants, protects against several toxic insults in neuronal cells (6Valente E.M. Abou-Sleiman P.M. Caputo V. Muqit M.M. Harvey K.

PINK1 catalytic activity is necessary for its neuroprotective role, because a kinase-deficient K219M substitution in the ATP binding pocket of PINK1 abrogates its ability to protect neurons (14Haque M.E. Thomas K.J. D'Souza C. Callaghan S. Kitada T. Slack R.S. Fraser P. Cookson M.R. Tandon A. Park D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although PINK1 mutations do not seem to impair mitochondrial targeting, PD-associated mutations differentially destabilize the protein, resulting in loss of neuroprotective activities (13Wang H.L.

Primary cells derived from PINK1 mutant patients exhibit mitochondrial fragmentation with disorganized cristae, recapitulated by RNA interference studies in HeLa cells (3Exner N. Treske B. Paquet D. Holmstrom K. Schiesling C. Gispert S. Carballo-Carbajal I. Berg D. Hoepken H.H. Gasser T. Kruger R. Winklhofer K.F. Vogel F. Reichert A.S. Auburger G. Kahle P.J. Schmid B. Haass C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are degraded by macroautophagy, a process involving sequestration of cytoplasmic cargo into membranous autophagic vacuoles (AVs) for delivery to lysosomes (22Chu C.T. Plowey E.D.

Interestingly, mitochondrial fission accompanies autophagic neurodegeneration elicited by the PD neurotoxin 6-OHDA (24Gomez-Lazaro M. Bonekamp N.A. Galindo M.F. Jordan J. Schrader M. Free Radic.

Moreover, mitochondrial fragmentation and increased autophagy are observed in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (4Zhu J.-H. Guo F. Shelburne J. Watkins S. Chu C.T. Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Hirai K. Aliev G. Nunomura A. Fujioka H. Russell R.L. Atwood C.S. Johnson A.B. Kress Y. Vinters H.V. Tabaton M.

Future Neurol. 2008; 3: 309-323PubMed Google Scholar). Although inclusion of mitochondria in autophagosomes was once believed to be a random process, as observed during starvation, studies involving hypoxia, mitochondrial damage, apoptotic stimuli, or limiting amounts of aerobic substrates in facultative anaerobes support the concept of selective mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) (29Kim I. Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Lemasters J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 462: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 30Tolkovsky A.M. Xue L. Fletcher G.C. Borutaite V. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In particular, mitochondrially localized kinases may play an important role in models involving oxidative mitochondrial injury (25Dagda R.K. Zhu J. Kulich S.M. Chu C.T.

Cherra III, S.J. Liu Y.J. Chu C.T. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Whereas properly regulated autophagy plays a homeostatic and neuroprotective role, excessive or incomplete autophagy creates a condition of “autophagic stress” that can contribute to neurodegeneration (28Cherra S.J. Chu C.T. Future Neurol. 2008; 3: 309-323PubMed Google Scholar). As mitochondrial fragmentation (3Exner N. Treske B. Paquet D. Holmstrom K. Schiesling C. Gispert S. Carballo-Carbajal I. Berg D.

Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have been described in human cells or tissues of PD patients, we investigated whether or not the engineered loss of PINK1 function could recapitulate these observations in human neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y). Stable knockdown of endogenous PINK1 gave rise to mitochondrial fragmentation and increased autophagy and mitophagy, whereas stable or transient overexpression of PINK1 had the opposite effect. Autophagy/mitophagy was dependent upon increased mitochondrial oxidant production and activation of fission. The data indicate that PINK1 is important for the maintenance of mitochondrial networks, suggesting that coordinated regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy limits cell death associated with loss of PINK1 function. Plasmids—PINK1 pcDNA6.1 constructs C-terminally tagged with V5 (12Petit A. Kawarai T. Paitel E. Sanjo N. Maj M. Scheid M. Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Salehi-Rad S. Wang L. Rogaeva E. Fraser P.

HA-tagged human cDNA for Parkin in the pReceiver vector was purchased from Genecopoeia (Germantown, MD). Mitochondrially targeted GFP (cytochrome oxidase VIII import sequence) and HA- or GFP-tagged wild-type and dominant negative K38A Drp1 in the EGFP-N1 backbone were provided by Dr. Stefan Strack (University of Iowa). The HA-Drp1 constructs simultaneously co-express shRNA specific for endogenous Drp1 (41Cribbs J.T. Strack S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). GFP-LC3 and RFP-LC3 were generously provided by Tamotsu Yoshimori (National Institute of Genetics, Japan) (42Kimura S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). Generation of Custom PINK1 Polyclonal Antibody—A polyclonal antibody (C8830) recognizing a predicted exposed loop in kinase subdomain IX of human PINK1 was generated using the services of Invitrogen and characterized for specificity in immunoblot and fluorescent applications. Generation of Stable PINK1-overexpressing and Knockdown Cell Lines—The SH-SY5Y cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), a dopaminergic human neuroblastoma cell line, was maintained as described (31Zhu J.H. Horbinski C. Guo F. Watkins S. Uchiyama Y. Chu C.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). For stable PINK1-overexpressing cell lines, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with PINK1-3xFlag in pReceiver M14 (Genecopoeia) or empty pReceiver M14 (control) using Lipofectamine 2000 (0.10% final, Invitrogen) and selected with G418 (Invitrogen; 1 mg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum) for 24 days. Individual colonies were expanded in 800 μg/ml G418. Expression of PINK1-3xFlag was confirmed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:5,000) (Sigma), and total PINK1 was detected using C8830 (1:2000). To generate stable PINK1-deficient lines, SH-SY5Y were transfected with PINK1 shRNA-encoding sequences (Origene, Rockville, MD) or control pRS shRNA vector and selected as above except that puromycin (0.6 μg/ml; Sigma) was used. To control for nonspecific or off-target effects, two series of PINK1 shRNA clones were generated, one targeting the N-terminal region (A series: CCAGGCTGGGCCGCAGGACCG) and the other a sequence in the kinase domain (D series: CCCCTCACCCCAACATCATCC). Individual colonies were screened by ΔΔCT analysis, using TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription-PCR probes for PINK1 and β-actin and the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Decreased protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis for PINK1 (C8830). Immunofluorescence and Imaging—SH-SY5Y cells were formaldehyde-fixed and stained with C8830 (1:2000), mouse-anti-HA tag (1:1000; Covance) and mouse anti-mitochondrial antigen, 60 kDa (clone 113-1, 1:400; BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). Fixed cells were then incubated in the appropriate Alexa 488-donkey anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, CA) or Cy3-donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and counter-stained with 1.25 μg/ml DAPI (Molecular Probes). Labeled cells were imaged at 25 °C using an IDX71 Olympus fluorescence microscope at a magnification of ×20 (0.45 numerical aperture) or ×40 (0.60 numerical aperture) and a DP70 microscope digital camera (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY; excitation/emission filter, 490/520 nm; 541/572 nm). Confocal Imaging—For mitophagy, GFP-LC3-transfected cells were stained with MitoTracker Red (100 nm, Molecular Probes) and imaged with an inverted FluoView 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope at ×60 magnification (1.42 numerical aperture) using the linear sequential scan mode function (Olympus America; excitation/emission filter, 488/510 nm; 561/592 nm). For three-dimensional reconstruction of mitochondria, 10-μm thick Z-stacks of 25-30 slices each were acquired using a FluoView 100 laser-scanning confocal microscope for at least 10-12 cells/condition. Three-dimensional projections were generated using Imaris 6.1 software (Bitplane Scientific Solutions, Zurich).

Molecular weights were estimated by relative mobility plotted against the log molecular weight of kaleidoscope standards (Bio-Rad). Cell Survival-Death Assay—Cell survival was measured using Alamar Blue (Trek Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH), at excitation 540 nm, emission 590 nm, in a Spectromax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell death was quantified using propidium iodide (Molecular Probes; 1 μg/ml for 5-10 min at 37 °C) as described (25Dagda R.K. Zhu J. Kulich S.M. Chu C.T. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 770-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and by counting the number of GFP-transfected cells containing fragmented, condensed, or pyknotic nuclei per epifluorescence micrograph. Mitochondrial Superoxide Assays—Cells were stained with MitoSOX (Molecular Probes) as described previously (44Kulich S.M. Horbinski C. Patel M. Chu C.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 372-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To quantify the average cellular integrated density of MitoSOX fluorescence, we used a Metamorph journal (Molecular Devices) designed by Simon Watkins of the Center for Biologic Imaging, which computes the integrated pixel intensity per cell. The average mean cellular integrated intensity of MitoSOX fluorescence per epifluorescence micrograph was normalized to cell number by counting the number of nuclei per field using the “count nuclei” function in the DRAQ5 (Biostatus Ltd., Leicestershire, UK) channel.

To quantify two parameters of mitochondrial morphology, another ImageJ macro was created for NIH Image (publically available for download from the ImageJ Wiki site; see supplemental Fig. S1 legend). The green channel of cells stained with MitoTracker Green FM (250 nm; Molecular Probes) or expressing mito-GFP was extracted to grayscale, inverted to show mitochondria-specific fluorescence as black pixels, and thresholded to optimally resolve individual mitochondria. The macro traces mitochondrial outlines using “analyze particles.” The mean area/perimeter ratio was employed as an index of mitochondrial interconnectivity, with inverse circularity used as a measure of mitochondrial elongation, as validated using well characterized mediators of mitochondrial fission and fusion (Fig. S1).

https://openalex.org/W2078177627,"Under pressure, metals exhibit increasingly shorter interatomic distances. Intuitively, this response is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the widths of the valence and conduction bands and hence a more pronounced free-electron-like behaviour. But at the densities that can now be achieved experimentally, compression can be so substantial that core electrons overlap. This effect dramatically alters electronic properties from those typically associated with simple free-electron metals such as lithium and sodium, leading in turn to structurally complex phases and superconductivity with a high critical temperature. But the most intriguing prediction - that the seemingly simple metals Li and Na will transform under pressure into insulating states, owing to pairing of alkali atoms - has yet to be experimentally confirmed. Here we report experimental observations of a pressure-induced transformation of Na into an optically transparent phase at 200 GPa (corresponding to 5.0-fold compression). Experimental and computational data identify the new phase as a wide bandgap dielectric with a six-coordinated, highly distorted double-hexagonal close-packed structure. We attribute the emergence of this dense insulating state not to atom pairing, but to p-d hybridizations of valence electrons and their repulsion by core electrons into the lattice interstices. We expect that such insulating states may also form in other elements and compounds when compression is sufficiently strong that atomic cores start to overlap strongly."

https://openalex.org/W2105440583,"The Longmen Shan mountain range, which defines the eastern margin of the Himalayas, exhibits greater topographic relief than anywhere else in the Tibetan plateau. It was the site of the devastating 2008 Wenchuan magnitude-7.9 earthquake. Prior to the earthquake, geodetic and geologic surveys measured little shortening across the range front, prompting vigorous debate about the forces producing the topography of this mountain belt. Now Judith Hubbard and John Shaw present evidence from balanced geologic cross-sections that suggests that crustal shortening is a primary driver for uplift of the Longmen Shan and the Tibetan plateau, and that the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake was a product of this shortening process. This paper presents balanced geologic cross-sections showing that crustal shortening, structural relief and topography are strongly correlated in the Longmen Shan mountain range front, suggesting that crustal shortening is a primary driver for uplift and topography of the Longmen Shan on the flanks of the Tibetan plateau. The authors conclude that the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake is an active manifestation of this shortening process. The Longmen Shan mountain range, site of the devastating 12 May 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.9) earthquake, defines the eastern margin of the Himalayan orogen and exhibits greater topographic relief than anywhere else in the Tibetan plateau. However, before the earthquake, geodetic and geologic surveys measured little shortening across the range front1,2,3, inspiring a vigorous debate about the process by which the topography of the mountain belt is produced and maintained. Two endmember models have been proposed: (1) brittle crustal thickening, in which thrust faults with large amounts of slip that are rooted in the lithosphere cause uplift4, and (2) crustal flow, in which low-viscosity material in the lower crust extrudes outward from the Tibetan plateau and inflates the crust north and east of the Himalayas5,6,7. Here we use balanced geologic cross-sections to show that crustal shortening, structural relief, and topography are strongly correlated in the range front. This suggests that crustal shortening is a primary driver for uplift and topography of the Longmen Shan on the flanks of the plateau. The 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.9) earthquake, which ruptured a large thrust fault along the range front causing tens of thousands of fatalities and widespread damage, is an active manifestation of this shortening process."
https://openalex.org/W2072301671,"Dietary restriction delays the incidence and decreases the growth of various types of tumours, but the mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of tumours to food restriction remain unknown. Here we show that certain human cancer cell lines, when grown as tumour xenografts in mice, are highly sensitive to the anti-growth effects of dietary restriction, whereas others are resistant. Cancer cells that form dietary-restriction-resistant tumours carry mutations that cause constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and in culture proliferate in the absence of insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Substitution of an activated mutant allele of PI3K with wild-type PI3K in otherwise isogenic cancer cells, or the restoration of PTEN expression in a PTEN-null cancer cell line, is sufficient to convert a dietary-restriction-resistant tumour into one that is dietary-restriction-sensitive. Dietary restriction does not affect a PTEN-null mouse model of prostate cancer, but it significantly decreases tumour burden in a mouse model of lung cancer lacking constitutive PI3K signalling. Thus, the PI3K pathway is an important determinant of the sensitivity of tumours to dietary restriction, and activating mutations in the pathway may influence the response of cancers to dietary restriction-mimetic therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2047454296,"Mechanotransduction, the translation of mechanical forces into nerve impulses, is the basis of a number of senses including hearing, touch and awareness of gravity. Johnston's organ, a cluster of close to 500 sensory neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster antenna, is known to detect the vibrations of the antenna induced by the courtship song of a potential mate. Two laboratories have now identified additional senses mediating this system: Martin Göpfert and Kei Ito and colleagues show that it detects antennal deflections imposed by gravity, and Yorozu et al. find the same for deflections caused by wind. The behavioural responses to these stimuli are different, however, since different subsets of neurons are stimulated in each case. The way that these distinct mechanical senses are handled by separate neuronal pathways in a single organ is reminiscent of the vestibular division of the human inner ear that allows it to process sound and balance. These studies open the way to further genetic investigation in Drosophila as a broadly relevant model system for the detection of mechanosensory stimuli. One of two papers identifying distinct clusters of neurons in the Johnston's organ, a structure from the fruitfly antenna previously associated with courtship song detection, that specifically respond either to continuous deflections of the antenna, as provoked by wind or gravity, or to vibrating stimuli such as sounds. The segregation of different mechanosensation modalities through separate neuronal pathways in one organ is reminiscent of the hearing and vestibular system division of mammals. Behavioural responses to wind are thought to have a critical role in controlling the dispersal and population genetics of wild Drosophila species1,2, as well as their navigation in flight3, but their underlying neurobiological basis is unknown. We show that Drosophila melanogaster, like wild-caught Drosophila strains4, exhibits robust wind-induced suppression of locomotion in response to air currents delivered at speeds normally encountered in nature1,2. Here we identify wind-sensitive neurons in Johnston’s organ, an antennal mechanosensory structure previously implicated in near-field sound detection (reviewed in refs 5 and 6). Using enhancer trap lines targeted to different subsets of Johnston’s organ neurons7, and a genetically encoded calcium indicator8, we show that wind and near-field sound (courtship song) activate distinct populations of Johnston’s organ neurons, which project to different regions of the antennal and mechanosensory motor centre in the central brain. Selective genetic ablation of wind-sensitive Johnston’s organ neurons in the antenna abolishes wind-induced suppression of locomotion behaviour, without impairing hearing. Moreover, different neuronal subsets within the wind-sensitive population respond to different directions of arista deflection caused by air flow and project to different regions of the antennal and mechanosensory motor centre, providing a rudimentary map of wind direction in the brain. Importantly, sound- and wind-sensitive Johnston’s organ neurons exhibit different intrinsic response properties: the former are phasically activated by small, bi-directional, displacements of the aristae, whereas the latter are tonically activated by unidirectional, static deflections of larger magnitude. These different intrinsic properties are well suited to the detection of oscillatory pulses of near-field sound and laminar air flow, respectively. These data identify wind-sensitive neurons in Johnston’s organ, a structure that has been primarily associated with hearing, and reveal how the brain can distinguish different types of air particle movements using a common sensory organ."

https://openalex.org/W2063193894,"Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies are characterized by the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated, insoluble tau. General anesthesia has been shown to be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, and we have previously demonstrated that anesthesia induces hypothermia, which leads to overt tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain of mice regardless of the anesthetic used. To investigate whether anesthesia enhances the long-term risk of developing pathological forms of tau, we exposed a mouse model with tauopathy to anesthesia and monitored the outcome at two time points-during anesthesia, or 1 wk after exposure. We found that exposure to isoflurane at clinically relevant doses led to increased levels of phospho-tau, increased insoluble, aggregated forms of tau, and detachment of tau from microtubules. Furthermore, levels of phospho-tau distributed in the neuropil, as well as in cell bodies increased. Interestingly, the level of insoluble tau was increased 1 wk following anesthesia, suggesting that anesthesia precipitates changes in the brain that provoke the later development of tauopathy. Overall, our results suggest that anesthesia-induced hypothermia could lead to an acceleration of tau pathology in vivo that could have significant clinical implications for patients with early stage, or overt neurofibrillary tangle pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1968107963,"Exocytosis at synapses involves fusion between vesicles and the plasma membrane. Although compound fusion between vesicles was proposed to occur at ribbon-type synapses, whether it exists, how it is mediated, and what role it plays at conventional synapses remain unclear. Here we report the existence of compound fusion, its underlying mechanism, and its role at a nerve terminal containing conventional active zones in rats and mice. We found that high potassium application and high frequency firing induced giant capacitance up-steps, reflecting exocytosis of vesicles larger than regular ones, followed by giant down-steps, reflecting bulk endocytosis. These intense stimuli also induced giant vesicle-like structures, as observed with electron microscopy, and giant miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), reflecting more transmitter release. Calcium and its sensor for vesicle fusion, synaptotagmin, were required for these giant events. After high frequency firing, calcium/synaptotagmin-dependent mEPSC size increase was paralleled by calcium/synaptotagmin-dependent post-tetanic potentiation. These results suggest a new route of exocytosis and endocytosis composed of three steps. First, calcium/synaptotagmin mediates compound fusion between vesicles. Second, exocytosis of compound vesicles increases quantal size, which increases synaptic strength and contributes to the generation of post-tetanic potentiation. Third, exocytosed compound vesicles are retrieved via bulk endocytosis. We suggest that this vesicle cycling route be included in models of synapses in which only vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is considered."

While solubilizing the cell wall alkali-insoluble fraction from a wild type strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a recombinant β-(1,3)-glucanase followed by chromatographic characterization of the digest on an anion exchange column, we observed a soluble polymer that eluted at the end of the solvent gradient run. Further characterization indicated this soluble polymer to have a molecular mass of ∼38 kDa and could be hydrolyzed only by β-(1,6)-glucanase. Gas chromatographymass spectrometry and NMR (1H and 13C) analyses confirmed it to be a β-(1,6)-glucan polymer with, on average, branching at every fifth residue with one or two β-(1,3)-linked glucose units in the side chain. This polymer peak was significantly reduced in the corresponding digests from mutants of the kre genes (kre9 and kre5) that are known to play a crucial role in the β-(1,6)-glucan biosynthesis. In the current study, we have developed a biochemical assay wherein incubation of UDP-[14C]glucose with permeabilized S. cerevisiae yeasts resulted in the synthesis of a polymer chemically identical to the branched β-(1,6)-glucan isolated from the cell wall.

Using this assay, parameters essential for β-(1,6)-glucan synthetic activity were defined. The cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other yeasts contains two types of β-glucans. In the former yeast, branched β-(1,3)-glucan accounts for ∼50–55%, whereas β-(1,6)-glucan represents 10–15% of the total yeast cell wall polysaccharides, each chain of the latter extending up to 140–350 glucose residues in length. The amount of 3,6-branched glucose residues varies with the yeast species: 7, 15, and 75% in S. cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, respectively (1Lesage G. Bussey H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). β-(1,6)-Glucan stabilizes the cell wall, since it plays a central role as a linker for specific cell wall components, including β-(1,3)-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins (2Kapteyn J.C.

However, the exact structure of the β-(1,6)-glucan and the mode of biosynthesis of this polymer are largely unknown. In S. pombe, immunodetection studies suggested that synthesis of this polymer backbone begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, with extension occurring in the Golgi (4Humbel B.M. Konomi M. Takagi T.

Among all of these genes, the ones that seem to play the major synthetic role are KRE5 and KRE9, since their disruption caused significant reduction (100 and 80%, respectively, relative to wild type) in the cell wall β-(1,6)-glucan content (11Brown J.L.

Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase from Trichoderma harzianum was expressed in Pichia pastoris (a kind gift from Prof. Stanley Brul, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (28de la Cruz J. Pintor-Toro J.A. Benitez T. Llobell A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion was undertaken by treating 1 mg of AI fraction with 2 units (μmol of reducing equivalents released/h/mg of protein) of the endo-β-(1,3)-glucanase in acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.2) at 37 °C for 60 h. Hydrolysis with endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase was performed by incubating 1 mg of sample (in acetate buffer; 50 mm, pH 5.5) with 2.5 units of enzyme at 37 °C for 24 h. Preliminary kinetic assays demonstrated that the incubation time and enzyme concentration were critical to the optimal digestion of the respective polymers, since the addition of more enzyme or a longer incubation time for the assay did not result in the release of additional reducing carbohydrates.HPLC Methods—The enzyme digests (the supernatants obtained after centrifugation of the reaction mixture at 10,000 × g for 10 min) were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography on a CarboPAC PA-1 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using NaOH (50 mm) and NaOAc (500 mm in 50 mm NaOH) as solvent A and B, respectively. The column was pre-equilibrated for 20 min with 98% A + 2% B. Following sample injection, a gradient run (flow rate 1 ml/min) was performed as follows: 0–2 min, isocratic step (98% A + 2% B), 2–15 min 98% A + 2% B to 65% A + 35% B, 15–22 min 65% A + 35% B to 57% A + 43% B, 22–23 min 57% A + 43% B to 100% B, and 23–25 min 100% B. Samples were detected on a pulsed electrochemical detector (nonradiolabeled digests) or using a radiometric detector (Packard Radiomatic Flo-one, equipped with a 500-μl liquid type cell) for the 14C-radiolabeled samples. Specific detection of the 14C-radiolabeled compounds was performed at 156 keV with a scintillant at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min.Low Pressure Liquid Chromatography—Soluble samples were subjected to gel filtration on a TSK HW40S column (90 × 1.4 cm; ToyoPearl), using 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid as the eluant at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The carbohydrate-containing fractions were identified with a refractive index detector (Gilson) and also by the phenol-sulfuric method. The average Mr of the polymer was determined using a Sephadex-G75 column (90 × 1.4 cm; Amersham Biosciences) with 0.5% acetic acid as the eluant at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. A calibration curve was obtained by plotting log Mr of dextran standards (Amersham Biosciences) against their Ve/Vo, where Ve is the elution volume of the sample and Vo is the column void volume.Gas Chromatography (GC)/Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC)-Mass Spectrometry (MS)—Vacuum-dried samples (2 mg) were subjected to methylation using the lithium methyl sulfinyl carbanion procedure (29Paz Parente J. Cardon P. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Ricart G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) modified by Fontaine et al. (30Fontaine T. Talmont F. Dutton G.G.S. Fournet B. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Then alditol acetates were obtained after hydrolysis (4 n trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 4 h), reduction, and peracetylation of the methylated samples (31Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 37: 1602-1604Google Scholar). GLC-MS analysis was recorded using an Automass II 30 quadripolar mass spectrometer interfaced with a Carlo Erba 8000 Top gas chromatograph (Finnigan, Argenteuil, France). Electron ionization spectra were recorded using ionization energy of 70 eV. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a TR-1 MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; Chrompack), and helium was the mobile phase used at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min; the column temperature was raised from 100 to 240 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min.NMR Analyses—NMR spectra were acquired at 308 K on a Varian spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 500 MHz and equipped with a triple resonance 1H {13C/15N} triax probe (Varian, Les Ulis, France). Samples were dissolved in 420 μl of D2O (99.97% 2H atoms; Euriso-top; Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France) and transferred in a 5-mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi Inc., Alison Park, PA). 1H chemical shifts were referenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (its methyl resonance was set to 0 ppm).13C chemical shifts were then calculated from 1H chemical shifts and γ ratio relative to DSS. A 13C/1H γ ratio of 0.251449530 was used (32Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar).The following nuclei assignment strategy was adopted. First, the proton resonances were assigned using two-dimensional COSY and RELAY experiments with one and two relays of 60 ms in order to follow connectivities from the anomeric proton up to the H4 proton of the glycosidic residues (33Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 34Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 151-156Google Scholar). The intraglycosidic residue spin systems were completed by means of a TOCSY experiment with a long mixing time (100 ms) (35Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). A 1H-13C edited gHSQC experiment and a 1H-13C gHSQC-TOCSY experiment with a mixing time of 80 ms was used to achieve 13C chemical shift assignments from previously identified 1H resonances (36Willker W. Leibfritz D. Kerssebaum R. Bermel W. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1993; 31: 287-292Crossref Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the CH2 groups were easily identified from the 1H-13C-edited gHSQC experiment. Then 1H, 1H coupling constant analysis from one-dimensional and/or COSY spectrum (1H resolution of 0.15 Hz and 1.5 Hz respectively) assessed the identity of monosaccharides. Moreover, the anomeric configuration of monosaccharide residues was established from knowledge of 3J1,2 values and confirmed by the measurement of the 1JC1H1 heteronuclear coupling constants in the 1H dimension of the gHMBC spectrum (1H resolution of 0.5 Hz) (36Willker W. Leibfritz D. Kerssebaum R. Bermel W. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1993; 31: 287-292Crossref Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Finally, glycosidic linkages were established via through-space dipolar interactions using 1H-1H NOESY experiments (mixing time of 200 ms) (37Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) and/or via three-bond interglycosidic 1H-13C correlations using a 1H-13C gHMBC experiment (long range delay of 60 ms).Cell Permeabilization—The method of Crotti et al. was used (20Crotti L.B. Drgon T. Cabib E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1010 cells were shaken with 0.04 m EDTA (10.5 ml) and β-ME (14.3 m, 72 μl) at 30 °C for 1 h and recovered by centrifugation (3300 × g, 10 min). The yeast pellet was washed with 0.8 m sorbitol (15 ml) and shaken again in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.2 (20.2 ml) containing EDTA (1 mm) and sorbitol (0.8 m) at 30 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the cells were subjected to osmotic shock by suspending them in 15 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, on ice for 15 min. Finally, 1010 cells were suspended in 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 1 ml). The efficacy of the protocol was checked by plating 50 μl of the cell suspension on YPD agar.Cell Fraction Preparation—Intact as well as permeabilized cells were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, suspended in the same buffer (1010 cells in 4 ml of buffer), and subsequently broken with glass beads (0.5 mm) in FastPrep (MP Biomedicals) by four cycles of vortex for 30 s interspersed with 1-min incubations on ice. Cells were also disrupted with glass beads (0.5 mm) in an MSK Braun cell homogenizer under a CO2 cooling system. The cell wall fraction was removed by low speed centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C) of the broken cells. The supernatant was subjected to a second centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet obtained (membrane fraction) was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 33% (v/v) glycerol (17Vink E. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Gerard-Vincent M. Ribas J.C. de Nobel H. van den Ende H. Duran A. Klis F.M. Bussey H. Yeast. 2004; 21: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the supernatant served as intracellular fraction. Protein content of the extracts was measured with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All of the fractions were stored at –70 °C or directly used for enzymatic assays.β-(1,6)-Glucan Synthase Assay—The assay mixture, in a total volume of 67 μl, contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm UDP-[14C]glucose (specific activity 34 nmol/125 nCi in the final reaction mixture), 0.2 mm ATP, 20 μm GTPγS, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm N-acetylglucosamine, and membrane fraction (100 μg of protein) or permeabilized cells (5 × 108 cells, equivalent to 27 μg of protein of membrane fraction). Neosynthesized polysaccharides were precipitated by two volumes of cold ethanol (–20 °C). The precipitate thus obtained was washed three times with water (500 μl each) and treated with 500 μl of 1 n NaOH containing 0.5 m NaBH4 at 65 °C for 1 h twice. The AI fraction was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, washed with water, neutralized using acetic acid, and characterized further by sequential enzymatic treatments (either with LamA and then an endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase or with an endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase and then LamA), HPLC, and methylation analysis as described above. Incorporation of the radioactivity was measured at each step using a Wallac 1410 liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results obtained in cpm were converted into nmol of glucose (as per the instructions from Amersham Biosciences). Specific enzymatic activity was calculated per μg of membrane protein equivalent (obtained from the same cell counts). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Single group comparisons were analyzed with Student's t test. Statistical significance was set as p < 0.05 for significant.TLC—Analysis of the methylated radiolabeled polymer was performed after trifluoroacetic acid (4 n, 100 °C, 4 h) hydrolysis. The hydrolysate was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in methanol (50 μl). Aliquots of 5 μl (corresponding to 1500 cpm) were spotted on an aluminum-backed Silica Gel-60 plate (Merck). Samples were separated using acetonitrile/chloroform/methanol (3:9:1) as the mobile phase (two ascents) (38Mukerjea R. Kim D. Robyt J. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 292: 11-20Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The gentio-oligogsaccharides obtained from radiolabeled 23.6 min polymer upon endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase digestion were separated on a BIOGEL-P2 column (130 × 1.5 cm, flow rate 8 ml/h, using 0.5% acetic acid as the solvent). The oligomeric fraction was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in water (10 μl), and 5-μl aliquots (corresponding to 500 cpm) were spotted on an aluminum-backed Silica Gel-60 plate (Merck). The migration was performed using propanol/acetone/water (9:6:5) as the mobile phase (two ascents). All of the plates were revealed using orcinol-H2SO4 reagent. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing TLC plates to a storage phosphor screen placed inside an exposure cassette and developed by using a PhosphorImager (STORM 850; Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software (version 5.2).Periodate Oxidation/Smith Degradation (39Goldstein I.J. Hay G.W. Lewis B.A. Smith F. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1965: 361-377Google Scholar)—Five mg (dry weight) samples were incubated in 2 ml of sodium meta-periodate, 100 mm, during for days at 4 °C in the dark. Excess periodate was destroyed following the addition of 400 μl of ethylene glycol. After dialysis against water (membrane cut-off, 1000 Da), the oxidized product was reduced for 2 h in 100 mm ammonium hydroxide (2 ml) containing 20 mg of NaBH4. Excess reagent was removed upon repeated co-distillations with methanol. Smith degradation was performed with 10% acetic acid at 100 °C for 1 h. Products were freeze-dried, reconstituted in water, and analyzed on a CarboPAC PA-1 chromatography column.Matrix-assisted Desorption Ionization/Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) MS—Spectra were acquired on a Voyager Elite DE-STR mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) and a gridless delayed extraction ion source. The spectrometer was operated in positive reflectron mode by delayed extraction with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, a pulse delay time of 200 ns, and a grid voltage of 66%. Samples were prepared by mixing directly on the target 0.5 μl of oligosaccharide solution in water (10–50 pmol) with 0.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (10 mg/ml in CH3OH/H2O, 50:50, v/v). The samples were allowed to dry for about 5 min at room temperature. Between 50 and 100 scans were averaged for every spectrum.RESULTSSolubilization of AI Fraction Using Recombinant Endo-β-(1,3)-glucanase—Solubilization of the cell wall AI fraction from the wild-type S. cerevisiae strain (BY4741) using an endo-β-(1,3)-glucanase followed by anion exchange column chromatography of the digest resulted in a profile containing glucose and laminaribiose and laminaritriose (eluted at 5.2, 9.7, and 10.4 min, respectively). In addition, a soluble polymer was eluted from the column at the end (23.6 min) of the solvent gradient run (with 100% solvent B, designated as the “23.6 min fraction” hereafter). The endo-β-(1,3)-glucanase-solubilized AI fraction from kre mutants (Δkre9 and kre5-ts2) showed a significant diminution (90 and 98%, respectively, compared with BY4741) in this 23.6 min peak area (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively), suggesting that this peak could be rich in β-(1,6)-glucan.Isolation and Structural Characterization of the 23.6 min Fraction—The polymer, eluting at 23.6 min from the anion exchange column, was isolated in bulk upon gel permeation chromatography of the endo-β-(1,3)-glucanase-solubilized cell wall AI fraction from the wild type strain of S. cerevisiae on a TSK HW40S column, wherein it eluted in the column void volume. The average molecular mass of this polymer that migrated as a single peak on a Sephadex G75 column was calculated to be 38 ± 2 kDa. Alditol acetates obtained upon successive hydrolysis, NaBH4 reduction, and acetylation of this gel permeation chromatography-purified polymer demonstrated the presence of only glucose upon GLC analysis. Further, the polymer upon methylation and GC-MS analysis showed mainly alditol acetates for 2,3,4-Me3Glc ((1,6)-linked), followed by 2,3,4,6-Me4Glc (permethylated) and 2,4-Me2Glc (3,6-branched) species in an approximate ratio of 5:1.5:1.2 and a trace amount of 2,4,6-Me3-Glc ((1,3)-linked) species. In addition, this polymer was resistant to endo-β-(1,3)-glucanase digestion but completely degraded by the recombinant endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase from T. harzianum (Fig. 2), which resulted in the release of glucose (eluted at 5.2 min from the anion exchange column) and an oligomeric mixture (eluted between 8.2 and 13.3 min) (Fig. 2). Purification of this mixture was undertaken on a TSK HW40S column, and the oligomers thus obtained were further characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS, GC-MS, and NMR. The peaks with retention times between 8.2 and 11.4 min on the CarboPac PA1 anion exchange column corresponded to that of the gentiobiose to gentiopentaose, standards, respectively, suggesting their linear structure. Further, MALDI-TOF analyses confirmed the presence of the oligomers with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 4 and 5 for the peaks with retention times of 10.3 and 11.4 min (m/z (M + Na+) = 689.23 and 851.33, respectively) (since the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix used was a limiting factor for the analysis of the m/z below 500). Oligosaccharides eluted between 12.1 and 13.3 min had m/z (M + Na+) of 689.31, 851.30, 1013.36, and 1175.42, respectively, corresponding to a DP of 4–7. Methylation followed by GC-MS analyses of the oligosaccharides migrating between 12.1 and 13.3 min was characterized by the appearance of 2,3,4,6-Me4-Glc and 2,4-Me2-Glc signals, in addition to the major 2,3,4-Me3-Glc ((1,6)-linked Glc) species, confirming their branching. The appearance of 2,4,6-Me3-Glc ((1,3)-linked) in the 13.3 min fraction corresponded to the DP 7. NMR analyses further confirmed that peaks migrating between 12.1 and 13.3 min were branched β-(1,6)-glucan-oligosaccharides. Based on these data, possible structures were assigned to the different oligosaccharides resulting from the endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase-cleaved 23.6 min polymer (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Degradation pattern of the 23.6 min peak (purified on a TSK-HW40S column) digested by an endo-β-(1,6)-glucanase.

https://openalex.org/W2097312542,"Background Bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) comprise a diverse transporter family functioning in conjugation, competence, and effector molecule (DNA and/or protein) translocation. Thirteen genome sequences from Rickettsia, obligate intracellular symbionts/pathogens of a wide range of eukaryotes, have revealed a reduced T4SS relative to the Agrobacterium tumefaciens archetype (vir). However, the Rickettsia T4SS has not been functionally characterized for its role in symbiosis/virulence, and none of its substrates are known. Results Superimposition of T4SS structural/functional information over previously identified Rickettsia components implicate a functional Rickettsia T4SS. virB4, virB8 and virB9 are duplicated, yet only one copy of each has the conserved features of similar genes in other T4SSs. An extraordinarily duplicated VirB6 gene encodes five hydrophobic proteins conserved only in a short region known to be involved in DNA transfer in A. tumefaciens. virB1, virB2 and virB7 are newly identified, revealing a Rickettsia T4SS lacking only virB5 relative to the vir archetype. Phylogeny estimation suggests vertical inheritance of all components, despite gene rearrangements into an archipelago of five islets. Similarities of Rickettsia VirB7/VirB9 to ComB7/ComB9 proteins of ε-proteobacteria, as well as phylogenetic affinities to the Legionella lvh T4SS, imply the Rickettsiales ancestor acquired a vir-like locus from distantly related bacteria, perhaps while residing in a protozoan host. Modern modifications of these systems likely reflect diversification with various eukaryotic host cells. Conclusion We present the rvh (Rickettsiales vir homolog) T4SS, an evolutionary conserved transporter with an unknown role in rickettsial biology. This work lays the foundation for future laboratory characterization of this system, and also identifies the Legionella lvh T4SS as a suitable genetic model."
https://openalex.org/W2041114499,"Beta-lactamase production and porin decrease are the well-recognized mechanisms of acquired beta-lactam resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. However, such mechanisms proved to be absent in K. pneumoniae isolates that are non susceptible to cefoxitin (FOX) and susceptible to amoxicillin+clavulanic acid in our hospital. Assessing the role of efflux pumps in this beta-lactam phenotype was the aim of this study.MICs of 9 beta-lactams, including cloxacillin (CLX), and other antibiotic families were tested alone and with an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), then with both CLX (subinhibitory concentrations) and EPI against 11 unique bacteremia K. pneumoniae isolates displaying the unusual phenotype, and 2 ATCC strains. CLX and EPI-dose dependent effects were studied on 4 representatives strains. CLX MICs significantly decreased when tested with EPI. A similar phenomenon was observed with piperacillin+tazobactam whereas MICs of the other beta-lactams significantly decreased only in the presence of both EPI and CLX. Thus, FOX MICs decreased 128 fold in the K. pneumoniae isolates but also 16 fold in ATCC strain. Restoration of FOX activity was CLX dose-dependent suggesting a competitive relationship between CLX and the other beta-lactams with regard to their efflux. For chloramphenicol, erythromycin and nalidixic acid whose resistance was also due to efflux, adding CLX to EPI did not increase their activity suggesting differences between the efflux process of these molecules and that of beta-lactams.This is the first study demonstrating that efflux mechanism plays a key role in the beta-lactam susceptibility of clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae. Such data clearly evidence that the involvement of efflux pumps in beta-lactam resistance is specially underestimated in clinical isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2019546599,"Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in huntingtin (htt). Whereas the pathological significance of the expanded polyQ has been clearly established and a tremendous effort to develop therapeutic tools for HD has been exerted, there is yet no effective cure. Whereas many molecules able to reduce the polyQ accumulation and aggregation have been identified, including several Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors, it remains very important to determine the mechanism of action of the potential drugs. ROCK inhibitors, including Y-27632 were reported to decrease aggregation of htt and androgen receptor (AR) through ROCK1 and protein kinase C-related protein kinase-2 (PRK-2). A downstream effector of ROCK1, actin-binding factor profilin, was shown to inhibit the mutant htt aggregation but not AR by direct interaction. We found that the anti-aggregation effect of ROCK inhibitors was not limited to the mutant htt and AR and that Y-27632 was also able to reduce the aggregation of ataxin-3 and atrophin-1 with expanded polyQ. These results suggested that in addition to the mechanism reported for htt and AR, there might also be other common mediators involved in the reduced aggregation of different polyQ proteins. In this study, we show that Y-27632 not only reduced the mutant htt aggregation by enhancing its degradation, but surprisingly was able to activate the main cellular degradation pathways, proteasome, and macroautophagy. We also show that this unique effect was mediated by ROCK1 and ROCK2."
https://openalex.org/W2056811914,"Parasites are likely to play an important role in structuring host populations. Many adaptively manipulate host behaviour, so that the extended phenotypes of these parasites and their distributions in space and time are potentially important ecological variables. The fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which is pan-tropical in distribution, causes infected worker ants to leave their nest and die under leaves in the understory of tropical rainforests. Working in a forest dynamic plot in Southern Thailand we mapped the occurrence of these dead ants by examining every leaf in 1,360 m2 of primary rainforest. We established that high density aggregations exist (up to 26 dead ants/m2), which we coined graveyards. We further established that graveyards are patchily distributed in a landscape with no or very few O. unilateralis-killed ants. At some, but not all, spatial scales of analysis the density of dead ants correlated with temperature, humidity and vegetation cover. Remarkably, having found 2243 dead ants inside graveyards we only found 2 live ants of the principal host, ant Camponotus leonardi, suggesting that foraging host ants actively avoid graveyards. We discovered that the principal host ant builds nests in high canopy and its trails only occasionally descend to the forest floor where infection occurs. We advance the hypothesis that rare descents may be a function of limited canopy access to tree crowns and that resource profitability of such trees is potentially traded off against the risk of losing workers due to infection when forest floor trails are the only access routes. Our work underscores the need for an integrative approach that recognises multiple facets of parasitism, such as their extended phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2047888628,"Cotton varieties expressing Cry proteins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are grown worldwide for the management of pest Lepidoptera. To prevent non-target pest outbreaks and to retain the biological control function provided by predators and parasitoids, the potential risk that Bt crops may pose to non-target arthropods is addressed prior to their commercialization. Aphids play an important role in agricultural systems since they serve as prey or host to a number of predators and parasitoids and their honeydew is an important energy source for several arthropods. To explore possible indirect effects of Bt crops we here examined the impact of Bt cotton on aphids and their honeydew. In climate chambers we assessed the performance of cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) when grown on three Indian Bt (Cry1Ac) cotton varieties (MECH 12, MECH 162, MECH 184) and their non-transformed near isolines. Furthermore, we examined whether aphids pick up the Bt protein and analyzed the sugar composition of aphid honeydew to evaluate its suitability for honeydew-feeders. Plant transformation did not have any influence on aphid performance. However, some variation was observed among the three cotton varieties which might partly be explained by the variation in trichome density. None of the aphid samples contained Bt protein. As a consequence, natural enemies that feed on aphids are not exposed to the Cry protein. A significant difference in the sugar composition of aphid honeydew was detected among cotton varieties as well as between transformed and non-transformed plants. However, it is questionable if this variation is of ecological relevance, especially as honeydew is not the only sugar source parasitoids feed on in cotton fields. Our study allows the conclusion that Bt cotton poses a negligible risk for aphid antagonists and that aphids should remain under natural control in Bt cotton fields."

https://openalex.org/W2129289037,"The presence of extensive reciprocal conformational freedom between the catalytic and the hemopexin-like domains of full-length matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is demonstrated by NMR and small angle x-ray scattering experiments. This finding is discussed in relation to the essentiality of the hemopexin-like domain for the collagenolytic activity of MMP-1. The conformational freedom experienced by the present system, having the shortest linker between the two domains, when compared with similar findings on MMP-12 and MMP-9 having longer and the longest linker within the family, respectively, suggests this type of conformational freedom to be a general property of all MMPs."
https://openalex.org/W2087030807,"Photoaffinity labeling of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)-receptors (GABAAR) with an etomidate analog and mutational analyses of direct activation of GABAAR by neurosteroids have each led to the proposal that these structurally distinct general anesthetics bind to sites in GABAARs in the transmembrane domain at the interface between the β and α subunits. We tested whether the two ligand binding sites might overlap by examining whether neuroactive steroids inhibited etomidate analog photolabeling. We previously identified (Li, G. D., Chiara, D.

Positioning these two photolabeled amino acids in a single type of binding site at the interface of β and α subunits (two copies per pentamer) is consistent with a GABAAR homology model based upon the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and with recent αM1 to βM3 cross-linking data. Biologically active neurosteroids enhance rather than inhibit azietomidate photolabeling, as assayed at the level of GABAAR subunits on analytical SDS-PAGE, and protein microsequencing establishes that the GABAAR-modulating neurosteroids do not inhibit photolabeling of GABAAR α1Met-236 or βMet-286 but enhance labeling of α1Met-236. Thus modulatory steroids do not bind at the same site as etomidate, and neither of the amino acids identified as neurosteroid activation determinants (Hosie, A. M., Wilkins, M. E., da Silva, H. M., and Smart, T. G. (2006) Nature 444, 486–489) are located at the subunit interface defined by our etomidate site model. Photoaffinity labeling of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)-receptors (GABAAR) with an etomidate analog and mutational analyses of direct activation of GABAAR by neurosteroids have each led to the proposal that these structurally distinct general anesthetics bind to sites in GABAARs in the transmembrane domain at the interface between the β and α subunits. We tested whether the two ligand binding sites might overlap by examining whether neuroactive steroids inhibited etomidate analog photolabeling. We previously identified (Li, G. D., Chiara, D. C., Sawyer, G. W., Husain, S. S., Olsen, R. W., and Cohen, J. B. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599–11605) azietomidate photolabeling of GABAAR α1Met-236 and βMet-286 (in αM1 and βM3).

Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). GABAAR are subject to modulation by endogenous neurosteroids, as well as myriad clinically important central nervous system drugs including general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, and possibly ethanol (1Olsen R.W.

The mechanism of GABAAR modulation by these different classes of drugs is of major interest, including identification of the receptor amino acid residues involved in binding and action of the drugs.In the absence of high resolution crystal structures of drug-receptor complexes, the locations of anesthetic binding sites in GABAARs have been predicted based upon analyses of functional properties of point mutant receptors, which identified residues in the α and β subunit M1–M4 transmembrane helices important for modulation by volatile anesthetics (primarily α subunit) and by intravenous agents, including etomidate and propofol (β subunit) (3Mihic S.J.

These residues were also proposed to contribute to a neurosteroid binding pocket in the transmembrane domain at the interface between β and α subunits, based upon their location in an alternative GABAAR structural model that positioned those amino acids, and not α1Met-236 or βMet-286, at the subunit interface. For GABAARs and other members of the Cys-loop superfamily of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, the transmembrane domain of each subunit is made up of a loose bundle of four α helices (M1–M4), with M2 from each subunit contributing to the lumen of the ion channel and M4 positioned peripherally in greatest contact with lipid, as seen in the structures of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) (17Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar) and in distantly related prokaryote homologs (18Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2008; 452: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). However, uncertainties in the alignment of GABAAR subunit sequences relative to those of the nAChR result in alternative GABAAR homology models (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4492-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that differ in the location of amino acids in the M3 and M4 membrane-spanning helices and in the M1 helix in some models (16Hosie A.M. Wilkins M.E. da Silva H.M. Smart T.G. Nature. 2006; 444: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 21Yamakura T. Bertaccini E. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).If etomidate and neurosteroids both bind at the same β/α interface in the GABAAR transmembrane domain, the limited space available for ligand binding suggests that their binding pockets might overlap and that ligand binding would be mutually exclusive. To address this question, we photolabeled purified bovine brain GABAAR with [3H]azietomidate in the presence of different neuroactive steroids and determined by protein microsequencing whether active neurosteroids inhibited labeling of α1Met-236 and βMet-286, as expected for mutually exclusive binding, or resulted in [3H]azietomidate photolabeling of other amino acids, a possible consequence of allosteric interactions. Active steroids failed to inhibit labeling and enhanced labeling of α1Met-236, clearly indicating that the neurosteroid and the etomidate sites are distinct. Our GABAAR homology model that positions α1Met-236 and βMet-286 at the β/α interface, but not that of Hosie et al. (16Hosie A.M. Wilkins M.E. da Silva H.M. Smart T.G. Nature. 2006; 444: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), is also consistent with cysteine substitution cross-linking studies (20Jansen M. Akabas M.H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4492-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Bali M. Jansen M. Akabas M.H. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which define the proximity relations between amino acids in the αM1, αM2, αM3, and βM3 helices, and these results support the interpretation that the two residues photolabeled by [3H]azietomidate are part of a single subunit interface binding pocket, whereas the steroid sensitivity determinants identified by mutagenesis neither are at the β/α subunit interface nor are contributors to a common binding pocket.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSolubilization and Purification of Bovine Brain GABAARs—GABAAR was purified as reported previously (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) on a benzodiazepine Ro7/1986-1 affinity column. Detailed conditions for solubilization and purification are described there.Photoaffinity Labeling of Purified GABAAR—The peak [3H]muscimol binding fraction (5 ml) from each affinity column elution was used for photolabeling without further dialysis or concentration. KCl was added to a final concentration of 0.1 m. An aliquot of GABAAR (∼40 nm [3H]muscimol binding sites, 2.5 ml for preparative labeling or 0.14 ml for analytical) was equilibrated with [3H]azietomidate (final concentration, 2 μm) ± additional drugs, incubated for 1 h in the dark (4 °C), and irradiated (30 min, 365 nm). After photolabeling, the total protein was precipitated with methanol/chloroform, solubilized in sample loading buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The resulting gel lanes were cut into 3-mm slices, and 3H incorporation was determined either directly by liquid scintillation counting (analytical labeling) or after elution from each slice into 1 ml of elution buffer (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the eluted bands were assayed for 3H and pooled for proteolytic digestion.Enzymatic Digestion, Reversed-phase HPLC, and Protein Microsequencing—Digestion with EndoLys-C (Princeton Separations) was carried out using 2.5 μg of protease for aliquots of GABAAR subunit in 50 μl of digestion buffer for 3 days at 25 °C. Reversed-phase HPLC and peptide microsequencing were performed as described (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). 3H release in each cycle of Edman degradation was determined by liquid scintillation counting of fractions for 6 × 10 min. Standard error bars are included in the plots (see Figs. 1 and 2). To determine the amount of peptide sequenced, the individual residues were fit to the equation Ix = I0 × Rx, where Ix is the pmol detected in cycle x, I0 is the starting amount of the peptide, and R is the average repetitive yield. The range of specific residue photolabeling ((2×(cpmn – cpmn–1)/I0 × Rx) was calculated using the I0 × Rx values calculated with 95% confidence. Treatment with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) during sequencing was as described (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J.

OPA reacts preferentially with primary rather than secondary amines (i.e. proline) and can be used at any cycle of Edman degradation to block sequencing of peptides not containing an N-terminal proline.FIGURE 2The neurosteroid THDOC does not inhibit [3H]azietomidate photolabeling of either α1Met-236 (αM1) or βMet-286 (βM3). Solubilized and affinity-purified GABAAR from bovine cortex (∼100 pmol muscimol sites/sample) was equilibrated with [3H]azietomidate and 1 mm GABA in the absence (○,□) or presence (•,▪) of 10 μm THDOC and photolabeled. Subunits were isolated and digested with EndoLys-C, and fragments were isolated for sequence analysis as described in supplemental Figs. 1–4. 3H (○, •) and phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids (□, ▪) released during Edman sequencing.

Release of 3H in cycle 14 in both samples confirmed labeling at α1Met-236 (–THDOC, 260–380 cpm/pmol; +THDOC, 440–1060 cpm/pmol). Error bars indicate S.E. B, sequence analysis of a sample containing βM3 beginning at Ala-280 (○, 530 cpm sequenced; •, 590 cpm sequenced). The fragment beginning at βAla-280 was present in both samples (–THDOC, I0 = 1.8 ± 0.3 pmol, r = 90 ± 2%; +THDOC, I0 = 2.1 ± 0.5 pmol, r = 89 ± 2%), and release in cycle 7 is consistent with labeling of βMet-286 (–THDOC, 20–43 cpm/pmol; +THDOC, 18–57 cpm/pmol).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNeuroactive Steroids Potentiate GABAAR Photolabeling—When purified bovine brain GABAARs photolabeled with [3H]azietomidate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, 3H incorporation was detected in GABAAR subunit polypeptides of ∼50–55 kDa that was inhibitable by >90% in the presence of nonradioactive etomidate and was shown to result from labeling of α1Met-236 (or the homologous methionine in α2, -3, -5) and βMet-286 (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To test for interactions between azietomidate and neurosteroids, we photolabeled GABAAR with [3H]azietomidate in the presence of 1 mm GABA (which enhances binding) and included (individually) in the labeling mixture three different neuroactive steroids: 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone), tetrahydro-deoxy-corticosterone (THDOC), or alphaxolone, at various concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 10 μm) in parallel. As shown in Fig. 1, all three steroids enhanced GABAAR subunit labeling in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration dependence of enhancement could be fit to logistic curves, yielding half-effect concentrations of 0.6, 0.9, and 0.8 μm for allopregnanolone, THDOC, and alphaxalone, respectively, under the experimental conditions employed. An inactive isomer of allopregnanolone, isopregnanolone (5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one), produced no modulation of labeling (Fig. 1A), demonstrating the pharmacological specificity of the observed enhancement of labeling.Neurosteroid Modulation of Photolabeling of α1Met-236/ βMet-286—Protein microsequencing established that the GABAAR subunit photolabeling seen in the absence or presence of GABA resulted from photolabeling of α1Met-236 and βMet-286 5As discussed in Li et al. (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), because of the high degree of sequence conservation for α subunit subtypes in the M1 region and β subunit subtypes in the M3 region, including protease cleavage sites, the labeled amino acids cannot be assigned to specific subunit subtypes, and therefore they are referred to as αMet-236 (using the α1 subunit numbering) and βMet-286. (12Li G.D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). As neurosteroids actually increased [3H]azietomidate photolabeling of GABAAR subunits, we wanted to determine whether the presence of neurosteroids increased the labeling of either (or both) of those residues or potentially reduced labeling at those positions while enhancing labeling of other residues in αM1 or βM3. Purified GABAAR was photolabeled on a preparative scale (110 pmol [3H]muscimol binding sites) with [3H]azietomidate and 1 mm GABA in the absence or presence of 10 μm THDOC. After fractionation of photolabeled GABAAR subunit by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1), the gel regions most enriched in labeled α and β subunits were identified by sequencing aliquots after digestion with EndoLys-C, which results in 3H release in cycle 7 of Edman degradation for βMet-286 and in cycle 14 for α1Met-236 (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). There was no evidence of labeling of other amino acids in αM1 or βM3. Material enriched in labeled α subunits, found in the gel slices containing the peak of 3H, and in labeled β subunits, enriched in the adjacent shoulders, were pooled separately and digested with EndoLys-C, and the digests were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC (supplemental Fig. S4). For quantification of the labeling of αMet-236, during sequence analysis of the samples enriched in photolabeled α subunits, the sequencing filter was treated with o-phthalaldehyde prior to cycle 11 (α1Pro-233) to block sequencing of all fragments not containing a proline in that cycle (Fig. 2A). The 3H release in cycle 14 (+THDOC, 40 cpm; –THDOC, 16 cpm) indicated labeling of α1Met-236, and the fragment beginning at α1Ile-223 was present at ∼0.4 pmol in both the samples. Taking into account the uncertainties inherent in the mass quantification at subpicomole levels, the observed 3H releases in cycle 14 indicated photolabeling of α1Met-236 at 310 cpm/pmol (260–380 cpm/pmol) in the absence of THDOC that was increased to 620 cpm/pmol (440–1000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of THDOC. Sequence analysis of the HPLC fractions containing the peak of 3H from the digests enriched in GABAAR β subunits (Fig. 2B) revealed the presence of the fragment beginning at βAla-280 at ∼1 pmol, and 3H release in cycle 7 (12 cpm) in both samples corresponded to labeling of βMet-286. Photolabeling of βMet-286 (20–43 cpm/pmol) was not inhibited by THDOC (18–57 cpm/pmol).Location of Labeled Residues in GABAAR Homology Models—The proposal that etomidate binds in the GABAAR transmembrane domain at the interface of β and α subunits followed from the locations of α1Met-236 and βM3–286 in a GABAAR homology model (12Li G.D.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) derived from the structure of the Torpedo nAChR (Fig. 3A), whereas the proposal that neurosteroids bind at that interface was consistent with the locations of αThr-237 and βTyr-284, positions determining sensitivity to direct activation by neurosteroids, in an alternative structural model (16Hosie A.M. Wilkins M.E. da Silva H.M. Smart T.G.

Misfolded proteins generated in the ER are degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Yeast Mnl1p consists of an N-terminal mannosidase homology domain and a less conserved C-terminal domain and facilitates the ERAD of glycoproteins. We found that Mnl1p is an ER luminal protein with a cleavable signal sequence and stably interacts with a protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). Analyses of a series of Mnl1p mutants revealed that interactions between the C-terminal domain of Mnl1p and PDI, which include an intermolecular disulfide bond, are essential for subsequent introduction of a disulfide bond into the mannosidase homology domain of Mnl1p by PDI. This disulfide bond is essential for the ERAD activity of Mnl1p and in turn stabilizes the prolonged association of PDI with Mnl1p. Close interdependence between Mnl1p and PDI suggests that these two proteins form a functional unit in the ERAD pathway. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a strict protein quality control system.

Protein folding/assembly in the ER is aided by molecular chaperones and folding enzymes. Molecular chaperones in the ER assist folding of newly synthesized proteins and prevent them from premature misfolding and/or aggregate formation (1Buck T.M. Wright C.M. Brodsk J.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Protein folding in the ER is often associated with formation of disulfide bonds, which contribute to stabilization of native, functional states of proteins. Disulfide bond formation could be a rate-limiting step of protein folding both in vitro and in vivo (3Creighton T.E. Zapun A. Darby N.J. Trends. Biotech. 1995; 13: 18-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and the ER has a set of folding enzymes including protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and its homologs that catalyze disulfide bond formation (5Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In parallel, protein folding/assembly in the ER relies on the inherent failsafe mechanism, i.e. the ER quality control system, to ensure that only correctly folded and/or assembled proteins can exit the ER. Misfolded or aberrant proteins are retained in the ER for refolding by ER-resident chaperones, whereas terminally misfolded proteins are degraded by the mechanism known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The ERAD consists of recognition and processing of aberrant substrate proteins, retrotranslocation across the ER membrane, and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation in the cytosol. More than 20 different components have been identified to be involved in this process in yeast and mammals (7Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The majority of proteins synthesized in the ER are glycoproteins, in which N-linked glycans are not only important for folding but also crucial for their ERAD if they fail in folding. Specifically, trimming of one or more mannose residues of Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide and recognition of the modified mannose moiety represent a key step for selection of terminally misfolded proteins for disposal (8Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A mannosidase I-like protein, Mnl1p/Htm1p (yeast), and EDEM (mammals, ER degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) were identified as candidates for lectins that recognize ERAD substrates with modified mannose moieties (9Nakatsukasa K.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Both Mnl1p and EDEM contain an N-terminal mannosidase homology domain (MHD), which lacks cysteine residues conserved among α1,2-mannosidase family members and is proposed to function in recognition of mannose-trimmed carbohydrate chains (supplemental Fig. S1). However, whether Mnl1p or EDEM indeed functions as an ERAD-substrate-binding lectin or has a mannosidase activity is still in debate (11Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O.

Mnl1p, but not EDEM, has a large C-terminal extension, which does not show any homology to known functional domains and is conserved only among fungal Mnl1p homologs (supplemental Fig. S1). After recognition of the modified mannose signal for degradation, aberrant proteins are maintained or converted to be retrotranslocation competent by ER chaperones including BiP (19Nishikawa S. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). PDI was also indicated to be involved in these steps in the ERAD by, for example, its possible chaperone-like functions (20Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 238: 38-42Google Scholar, 22Gillece P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The yeast PDI, Pdi1p, contains four thioredoxin-like domains, two of which have a CGHC motif as active sites, followed by a C-terminal extension containing the ER retention signal. During its catalytic cycle, PDI transiently forms a mixed disulfide intermediate with its substrate through an intermolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine residues of the active site of PDI and the substrate molecule. Here we report identification of PDI as an Mnl1p-interacting protein. Stable interactions between the C-terminal domain of Mnl1p and PDI involve intermolecular disulfide bonds. Stably interacting PDI is required for formation of the functionally essential intramolecular disulfide bond in the MHD of Mnl1p, which in turn stabilizes and prolongs the Mnl1p-PDI interactions. Possible roles for those stable interactions between Mnl1p and PDI in the ERAD will be discussed.

The amplified DNA fragment, flanked by 40 base pairs each of the upstream and downstream sequences of the MNL1 gene, was introduced into KRY94, and Trp+ transformants were selected. Disruption of the MNL1 gene was confirmed by PCR, and the resulting strain was named W303-1A mnl1ΔpdiΔ/pPDI-URA3.

The samples were diluted 5-fold with 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 mm pepstatin A. Endoglycosidase H (Seikagaku Corporation) was added to 10 units/ml, and the samples were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Extraction of Mnl1p—The microsomes were incubated in 20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 300 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm PMSF containing 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, or 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate soluble and insoluble fractions. Cycloheximide Chase Experiments—The cells were grown to OD600 = 1.5–2, and cycloheximide was added directly to the cell culture at 0.2 mg/ml. 0, 30, 60, or 90 min after the addition of cycloheximide, an equal volume of cell culture was removed and was incubated further in the presence of 10 mm NaN3 for 10 min on ice. Cell extracts were prepared as described by Yaffe and Schatz (33Yaffe, M. P., and Schatz, G. (198) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 4819–4823Google Scholar). Modification of Cys with AMS and Maleimde-PEG5000—The cells were suspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid and disrupted by agitation with glass beads. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C followed by washing twice with cold acetone. Protein pellets were suspended in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 1 mm PMSF in the presence of 25 mm AMS (Invitrogen) or 5 mm maleimide-PEG5000 (Laysan Bio, Inc). After incubation on ice for 15 min at 37 °C for 10 min, the samples were boiled for 2 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To generate a fully reduced form of PDI, the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated pellets were boiled in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 1 mm PMSF for 5 min, and the soluble fraction was incubated with 100 mm DTT at 30 °C for 30 min. Then proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid again and subsequently solubilized in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 1 mm PMSF in the presence of 25 mm AMS or 5 mm maleimide-PEG5000. After incubation on ice for 15 min, at 37 °C for 10 min, the samples were boiled for 2 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Mnl1p Is an ER Luminal Protein with a Cleavable Signal Sequence—Mnl1p was previously shown to reside in the yeast ER (9Nakatsukasa K. Nishikawa S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8635-8638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We first asked whether the hydrophobic segment at the N terminus of Mnl1p functions as a cleavable signal sequence or a transmembrane segment to anchor the protein to the ER membrane. Immunoblotting of microsomes prepared from cells expressing FLAG-tagged Mnl1p (Mnl1p-FLAG) with the anti-FLAG antibody showed a 102-kDa band, which shifted to 91 kDa after treatment with endoglycosidase H, indicating that Mnl1p contains N-linked carbohydrate chains (Fig. 1A). Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), which has four N-glycan sites, was used as a positive control. Mnl1p was, like an ER luminal protein BiP, resistant against externally added proteinase K but became protease-susceptible after disruption of the membrane with Triton X-100 (Fig. 1B). When treated with alkaline sodium carbonate, Mnl1p and BiP were mainly recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation, whereas Sec63p, an integral ER membrane protein, was recovered in the pellet (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). Treatment of the microsomes with Triton X-100 solubilized all of these proteins (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). These results collectively indicate that Mnl1p is an ER luminal protein, but not anchored to the ER membrane. Indeed, Mnl1p-FLAG and BiP in the yeast sec11 mutant, a temperature-sensitive mutant of the subunit of the ER signal peptidase (26Böhni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), exhibited higher molecular weight bands (the bands from Mnl1p-FLAG with different extents of N-glycosylation became clearer after endonuclease H treatment) at restrictive temperature (37 °C) than at permissive temperature (23 °C) (Fig. 1D). Therefore the N-terminal hydrophobic segment of Mnl1p most likely functions as a cleavable signal sequence that guides the mature protein to the ER lumen. Mnl1p Interacts with PDI—Because Mnl1p facilitates ERAD of glycoproteins in the ER (9Nakatsukasa K. Nishikawa S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8635-8638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Jakob C.A. Bodmer D. Spirig U. Battig P. Marcil A. Dignard D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Aebi M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), we searched for its possible partner proteins cooperating with Mnl1p in the ERAD. When microsomes with Mnl1p-FLAG were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the immobilized anti-FLAG antibody, PDI was found to be retained on the beads in particular when Mnl1p-FLAG was expressed from a multicopy plasmid (Fig. 2, A and B). When solubilized microsomes were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-PDI antibodies, Mnl1p-FLAG was in turn detected in the co-immunoprecipitated fractions (Fig. 2, C and D). Hemagglutinin-tagged Yos9p, hemagglutinin-tagged Mns1p (α1,2-mannosidase in yeast), or BiP was not detected by the anti-hemagglutinin antibody (for Yos9p and Mns1p) or anti-BiP antibodies (for BiP) in the co-immunoprecipitated fractions (data not shown). We next asked whether the interactions between Mnl1p and PDI involve intermolecular disulfide bonds. To minimize oxidation of Mnl1p after cell lysis, the proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid from the spheroplasts expressing Mnl1p-FLAG and solubilized with SDS in the presence of iodoacetamide, which can alkylate thiol groups to prevent artificial disulfide shuffling. Then Mnl1p-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions followed by immunoblotting with anti-Mnl1p antibodies and anti-PDI antibodies (Fig. 2E). Mnl1p exhibited two high molecular weight bands of ∼250 kDa (denoted by circles) in addition to the band of 102 kDa corresponding to the Mnl1p monomer (denoted by a triangle) under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 4) but not under reducing conditions (Fig. 2E, lanes 10 and 12). The 250–300-kDa bands were also detected by anti-PDI antibodies under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2E, lanes 6 and 8), suggesting that the 250–300-kDa bands correspond to complexes formed by intermolecular disulfide bond(s) between Mnl1p and PDI. Quantification of the pulldown results under the conditions of Mnl1p being expressed from a multicopy plasmid suggests that about half the Mnl1p molecules interact with PDI and that ∼30% of PDI with Mnl1p through disulfide bonds (data not shown). Inter- and Intramolecular Disulfide Bond Formation of Mnl1p by PDI—Mnl1p contains eight cysteine residues in its mature domain, which are named C1–C8 (Fig. 3A); C1–C3 are in the MHD and C4–C8 in the C-terminal domain of Mnl1p. To identify the cysteine residues involved in the intermolecular disulfide bond with PDI, we made a series of Cys → Ser mutants of Mnl1p (C1S to C8S), in which each of the eight Cys was replaced by Ser, and analyzed their disulfide bond formation by nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Mnl1p antibodies and anti-PDI antibodies (Fig. 3B). The upper (filled circles) and lower (open circles) bands of the 250–300-kDa Mnl1p-PDI complexes disappeared in C5S and C6S mutant cells, respectively (Fig. 3B, lanes 30, 31, 41, and 42). Combination of the C5S and C6S mutations (C5S,C6S) resulted in the complete disappearance of the two bands (Fig. 3B, lanes 25 and 36). Therefore C5 and/or C6 of Mnl1p form intermolecular disulfide bonds with PDI, and the upper and lower bands of 250–300 kDa correspond to Mnl1p-PDI complexes with disulfide bonds involving C5 and C6, respectively. During the analyses of the Mnl1p-PDI complex, we noted that the migration rates of the Mnl1p monomer varied for different Cys mutants under nonreducing conditions, but not under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B). The C1S and C3S mutants showed faster migration rates than the wild type (WT) Mnl1p, suggesting that the upper band corresponds to the Mnl1p monomer with fully oxidized C1 and C3 (denoted as ox) and the lower band to the one without a disulfide bond between C1 and C3 (denoted as red). The S1S2 (C61S,C64S) and S5S6 (C406S,C409S) mutants of PDI have Cys → Ser mutations in the CGHC motif in one of the two active site thioredoxin domains (see Fig. 7A) and still have disulfide forming activity (34Holst B. Tachibana C. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Kulp M.S. Frickel E.M. Ellgaard L. Weissman J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 876-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mnl1p in cells expressing the S1S2 or S5S6 PDI mutants showed only the lower bands for the reduced Mnl1p monomer under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3C), suggesting that oxidation of C1 and C3 requires both of the two active thioredoxin domains in PDI.

https://openalex.org/W2170163120,"We previously showed that the tumor suppressor gene REIC/Dkk-3, when overexpressed by an adenovirus (Ad-REIC), exhibited a dramatic therapeutic effect on human cancers through a mechanism triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Adenovirus vectors show no target cell specificity and thus may elicit unfavorable side effects through infection of normal cells even upon intra-tumoral injection. In this study, we examined possible effects of Ad-REIC on normal cells. We found that infection of normal human fibroblasts (NHF) did not cause apoptosis but induced production of interleukin (IL)-7. The induction was triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress and mediated through IRE1alpha, ASK1, p38, and IRF-1. When Ad-REIC-infected NHF were transplanted in a mixture with untreated human prostate cancer cells, the growth of the cancer cells was significantly suppressed. Injection of an IL-7 antibody partially abrogated the suppressive effect of Ad-REIC-infected NHF. These results indicate that Ad-REIC has another arm against human cancer, an indirect host-mediated effect because of overproduction of IL-7 by mis-targeted NHF, in addition to its direct effect on cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2119070895,"Extracellular electrical stimulation (EES) of the central nervous system (CNS) has been used empirically for decades, with both fundamental and clinical goals. Currently, microelectrode arrays (MEAs) offer new possibilities for CNS microstimulation. However, although focal CNS activation is of critical importance to achieve efficient stimulation strategies, the precise spatial extent of EES remains poorly understood. The aim of the present work is twofold. First, we validate a finite element model to compute accurately the electrical potential field generated throughout the extracellular medium by an EES delivered with MEAs. This model uses Robin boundary conditions that take into account the surface conductance of electrode/medium interfaces. Using this model, we determine how the potential field is influenced by the stimulation and ground electrode impedances, and by the electrical conductivity of the neural tissue. We confirm that current-controlled stimulations should be preferred to voltage-controlled stimulations in order to control the amplitude of the potential field. Second, we evaluate the focality of the potential field and threshold-distance curves for different electrode configurations. We propose a new configuration to improve the focality, using a ground surface surrounding all the electrodes of the array. We show that the lower the impedance of this surface, the more focal the stimulation. In conclusion, this study proposes new boundary conditions for the design of precise computational models of extracellular stimulation, and a new electrode configuration that can be easily incorporated into future MEA devices, either in vitro or in vivo, for a better spatial control of CNS microstimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2000239850,"The small heat shock protein alphaB-crystallin interacts with N2B-Us, a large unique sequence found in the N2B element of cardiac titin. Using single molecule force spectroscopy, we studied the effect of alphaB-crystallin on the N2B-Us and its flanking Ig-like domains. Ig domains from the proximal tandem Ig segment of titin were also studied. The effect of wild type alphaB-crystallin on the single molecule force-extension curve was determined as well as that of mutant alphaB-crystallins harboring the dilated cardiomyopathy missense mutation, R157H, or the desmin-related myopathy mutation, R120G. Results revealed that wild type alphaB-crystallin decreased the persistence length of the N2B-Us (from approximately 0.7 to approximately 0.2 nm) but did not alter its contour length. alphaB-crystallin also increased the unfolding force of the Ig domains that flank the N2B-Us (by 51 +/- 3 piconewtons); the rate constant of unfolding at zero force was estimated to be approximately 17-fold lower in the presence of alphaB-crystallin (1.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) versus 2.4 x 10(-3) s(-1)). We also found that alphaB-crystallin increased the unfolding force of Ig domains from the proximal tandem Ig segment by 28 +/- 6 piconewtons. The effects of alphaB-crystallin were attenuated by the R157H mutation (but were still significant) and were absent when using the R120G mutant. We conclude that alphaB-crystallin protects titin from damage by lowering the persistence length of the N2B-Us and reducing the Ig domain unfolding probability. Our finding that this effect is either attenuated (R157H) or lost (R120G) in disease causing alphaB-crystallin mutations suggests that the interaction between alphaB-crystallin and titin is important for normal heart function."
https://openalex.org/W2077553806,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by the phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) induces ceramide formation through the salvage pathway involving, in part, acid beta-glucosidase 1 (GBA1), which cleaves glucosylceramide to ceramide. Here, we examine the role of the GBA1-ceramide pathway, in regulating a pro-inflammatory pathway initiated by PKC and leading to activation of p38 and induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6). Inhibition of ceramide formation by fumonisin B1 or down-regulation of PKCdelta potentiated PMA-induced activation of p38 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Similarly, knockdown of GBA1 by small interfering RNAs or pharmacological inhibition of GBA1 promoted further activation of p38 after PMA treatment, implicating the GBA1-ceramide pathway in the termination of p38 activation. Knockdown of GBA1 also evoked the hyperproduction of IL-6 in response to 4beta phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. On the other hand, increasing cellular ceramide with cell-permeable ceramide treatment resulted in attenuation of the IL-6 response. Importantly, silencing the delta isoform of the p38 family significantly attenuated the hyperproduction of IL-6. Reciprocally, p38delta overexpression induced IL-6 biosynthesis. Thus, the GBA1-ceramide pathway is suggested to play an important role in terminating p38delta activation responsible for IL-6 biosynthesis. Furthermore, the p38delta isoform was identified as a novel and predominant target of ceramide signaling as well as a regulator of IL-6 biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1992718962,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) promotes the salvage pathway of ceramide formation, and acid sphingomyelinase has been implicated, in part, in providing substrate for this pathway (Zeidan, Y. H., and Hannun, Y. A. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 11549-11561). In the present study, we examined whether acid beta-glucosidase 1 (GBA1), which hydrolyzes glucosylceramide to form lysosomal ceramide, was involved in PKC-regulated formation of ceramide from recycled sphingosine. Glucosylceramide levels declined after treatment of MCF-7 cells with a potent PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Silencing GBA1 by small interfering RNAs significantly attenuated acid glucocerebrosidase activity and decreased PMA-induced formation of ceramide by 50%. Silencing GBA1 blocked PMA-induced degradation of glucosylceramide and generation of sphingosine, the source for ceramide biosynthesis. Reciprocally, forced expression of GBA1 increased ceramide levels. These observations indicate that GBA1 activation can generate the source (sphingosine) for PMA-induced formation of ceramide through the salvage pathway. Next, the role of PKCdelta, a direct effector of PMA, in the formation of ceramide was determined. By attenuating expression of PKCdelta, cells failed to trigger PMA-induced alterations in levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and glucosylceramide. Thus, PKCdelta activation is suggested to stimulate the degradation of both sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide leading to the salvage pathway of ceramide formation. Collectively, GBA1 is identified as a novel source of regulated formation of ceramide, and PKCdelta is an upstream regulator of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2071145673,"Differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts from hematopoietic precursors depends upon expression of the cytokine receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) by fibroblastic stromal cells, which some evidence suggests are of the osteoblast lineage. We have shown previously that hormonal-responsiveness of the murine RANKL gene is mediated in part by a distal enhancer that binds Runx2, a transcription factor required for commitment to the osteoblast lineage, supporting the idea that osteoclast-supporting stromal cells may be osteoblasts or their progenitors. However, in this study we demonstrate that parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulation of RANKL in mice is not affected by a significant reduction in the number of osteoblasts. Consistent with this, neither Runx2, nor Cbfb, a binding partner essential for Runx activity, are required for basal or PTH-stimulated RANKL expression in fibroblastic stromal cell models. Nonetheless, RANKL responsiveness to PTH was elevated in cultured calvaria cells expressing high levels of osterix, another transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation, and this was associated with elevated PTH receptor expression. The responsiveness of RANKL to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was not elevated in the osterix-expressing cells. Together, these results suggest that commitment to the osteoblast lineage is not a requirement for RANKL gene transcription in fibroblastic stromal cells but may enhance responsiveness of this gene to specific hormones via control of their receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2110079312,"Background Aberrant epigenetic silencing plays a major role in cancer formation by inactivating tumor suppressor genes. While the endpoints of aberrant silencing are known, i.e., promoter region DNA methylation and altered histone modifications, the triggers of silencing are not known. We used the tet-off system to test the hypothesis that a transient reduction in gene expression will sensitize a promoter to undergo epigenetic silencing. Methodology/Principal Findings The tet responsive promoter (PTRE) was used to drive expression of the selectable human HPRT cDNA in independent transfectants of an Hprt deficient mouse cell line. In this system, high basal HPRT expression is greatly reduced when doxycycline (Dox) is added to the culture medium. Exposure of the PTRE-HPRT transfectants to Dox induced HPRT deficient clones in a time dependent manner. A molecular analysis demonstrated promoter region DNA methylation, loss of histone modifications associated with expression (i.e., H3 lysine 9 and 14 acetylation and lysine 4 methylation), and acquisition of the repressive histone modification H3 lysine 9 methylation. These changes, which are consistent with aberrant epigenetic silencing, were not present in the Dox-treated cultures, with the exception of reduced H3 lysine 14 acetylation. Silenced alleles readily reactivated spontaneously or after treatment of cells with inhibitors of histone deacetylation and/or DNA methylation, but re-silencing of reactivated alleles did not require a new round of Dox exposure. Inhibition of histone deacetylation inhibited both the induction of silencing and re-silencing, whereas inhibition of DNA methylation had no such effect. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that a transient reduction in gene expression triggers a pathway for aberrant silencing in mammalian cells and identifies histone deacetylation as a critical early step in this process. DNA methylation, in contrast, is a secondary step in the silencing pathway under study. A model to explain these observations is offered."
https://openalex.org/W2010432253,"Arsenicals are both environmental carcinogens as well as therapeutic agents for the treatment of trypanosomiasis and more recently cancer. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been successfully used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and has activity in multiple myeloma (MM). While signaling events associated with carcinogenesis have been well studied, it still remains to be determined which of these events are involved in anti-cancer signaling. To better define this response, gene expression profiling following ATO treatment of four MM cell lines was performed. The pattern was consistent with a strong antioxidative response, particularly of genes activated by Nrf2. While Nrf2 is expressed constitutively at the mRNA level, the protein is not detected in untreated cells. Consistent with inactivation of Keap1, Nrf2 protein is stabilized and present in the nucleus within 6 h of ATO treatment. Despite the activation of this antioxidative response, ROS may not be important in ATO-induced death. Inhibition of ATO-induced ROS with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) does not affect Nrf2 activation or cell death. Moreover, silencing Nrf2 had no effect on ATO-induced apoptosis.

Inactive Nrf2 resides in the cytoplasm and it is rapidly degraded through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. The cytoplasmic Nrf2-binding protein Keap1 targets the ubiquitination of Nrf2 through its association with Cullin-3 and Rbx1 (17Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 89-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar). Activated Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus, binds to the ARE of target genes, and induces the transcription of these genes. The activation of Nrf2 is not completely understood, but two mechanisms are supported by the available evidence. In the first mechanism, modification of the sulfydryl groups present in Keap1 by chemical inducers dissociates Nrf2 from Keap1 and the subsequent translocation into the nucleus, thereby activating ARE (20Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Watai Y. Tong K.I. Shibata T. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Alternatively, several upstream signaling kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC), phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38, JNK, and ERK1/2) have been reported to regulate Nrf2/ARE activity (21Lee J.S.

Together with the ARE-regulated target genes, the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is a sensing/transcriptional gene regulation mechanism critical in defense against endogenous and environmental toxic compounds. Loss of Nrf2 transcriptional activity has been associated with augmented sensitivity to carcinogens and certain diseases (24Hu X. Roberts J.R. Apopa P.L. Kan Y.W. Ma Q. Mol.

Consistent with this role, activation of Nrf2 is a common target of many chemopreventive agents and is activated by antioxidants (27Gao X. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10446-10451Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this study we found that ATO activates Nrf2 and induces apoptosis in MM cell lines, through a mechanism that is independent of ROS.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines—U266 and 8226/S were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

The ECL Rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole Ab (from donkey) (GE HealthCare, NJ) and the anti-mouse IgG1-HRP conjugate (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) were used as secondary antibody for Western blot.Vectors and Stable Expression of HO-1—HO-1 cDNA was obtained from ATCC (10589047, in pExpress1 vector, ATCC) and amplified by PCR with specific primers to introduce the KpnI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Amplified HO-1 cDNA was cloned into the KpnI-XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). HO-1 expression vector was introduced into U266 cells by nucleofection (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were electroporated in 100 μl of cell line nucleofector solution (Amaxa Reagent C) with 2 μg of DNA, using preselected Amaxa Program X005. Electroporated cells were plated with supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and 0.5 μg/ml G418 were used for selection of HO-1-expressing U266 cells.Cell Viability by Annexin V-Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) and PI Staining—Cell viability was measured by Annexin V-FITC (Biovision, Palo Alto, CA) and PI staining, following manufacturer's instructions as previously described (13Grad J.M. Bahlis N.J. Reis I. Oshiro M.M. Dalton W.S. Boise L.H. Blood. 2001; 98: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Samples were acquired on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Viability or percent (%) of control viability was determined as percent of Annexin-V-negative cells.Cellular Assays—All cells were incubated at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml with the indicated concentrations of ATO and/or BSO (100 μm), NAC (10 mm), hemin, ZnCl2, or PS-341. Hemin and ZnCl2 pretreatment: cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of hemin or ZnCl2, for 24 h prior to ATO addition, to induce HO-1 and metallothionein-1 (MT1), respectively. Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was used to determine ATO-induced apoptosis. ATO plus Bortezomib treatment: cells were treated with ATO (2 μm), bortezomib (40 nm), or the combination, for 6 h. Samples were analyzed by annexin-V-FITC/PI staining for cell viability, and cell pellets were frozen for protein analysis by Western blot. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were also obtained for nuclear translocation analysis by Western blot (see “Subcellular Fractionation”).Affymetrix Array—Four cell lines were treated for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h with 2 μm ATO. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the hybridization and initial data analysis performed by Expression Analysis Inc. (Durham, NC). Affymetrix Hu133 2.0 Plus Chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), containing over 50,000 (54,675 including controls) probe sets were used as previously described (28Morales A.A. Gutman D. Lee K.P. Boise L.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 5152-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).RT-PCR for MT1—To assess mRNA expression, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by the MuLV Reverse Transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction and the generated cDNA (1 μl) was amplified by the AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, LD, using the following specific mixture of primers for MT1: MT1-Forward Primer: 5′-ATG GAC CCC AAC TGC TCC TG-3′ (for all the MT1 forms), MT1XH-Reverse Primer: 5′-TCA GGC ACA GCA GCT GCA CTT-3′(for MT1X and MT1H forms) and MT1FG-Reverse Primer: 5′-TCA GGC GCA GCA GCT GCA CTT-3′ (for MT1F and MT1G forms).Real-time PCR—cDNA was amplified using TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems) on the 7700 Sequence Detection System following manufacturer's protocol and the 20× human MT1H and MT2A TaqMan® assays (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan® human actin was used as endogenous control. MT1H and MT2A mRNA expression was calculated as relative quantification (RQ), normalized using actin mRNA expression.Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed using standard techniques as previously described (28Morales A.A. Gutman D. Lee K.P. Boise L.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 5152-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 10–30 μg of total proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK).Subcellular Fractionation—Nuclear fractions were obtained as follows. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), plus protease inhibitor mixture, and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were collected and stored at -80 °C, whereas the pellets were further processed to obtain nuclear extracts. Pellets were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease inhibitors and incubated for 10 min on ice. Nuclear extracts were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (supernatant). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology).Silencing Studies using Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA)—siRNAs were obtained from DHARMACON RNA Technologies Inc. (Chicago, IL) selecting the ON-TARGET-plus SMARTpool duplexes as the RNAi-specific technology platform. siRNA against human Nrf2 (NFE2L2, L-003755), Keap1 (KEAP1, L-012453), and the siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA [siRNA(-)] were used. siRNAs were introduced into cells by nucleofection (Amaxa) following the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (28Morales A.A. Gutman D. Lee K.P. Boise L.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 5152-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Then, cells were treated with ATO, and samples were harvested at 24 and 48 h, for ATO-induced apoptosis determination by Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining and at 6 and 24 h, for protein expression analysis by Western blot.Intracellular ROS Detection—DHE was used as fluorescent probe to detect intracellular ROS as superoxide. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells (control or treated cells) were washed twice with PBS and stained for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm DHE in PBS. Samples were washed once with PBS and then were acquired on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).RESULTSGene Expression Profiling of the Response to ATO Treatment in MM Cell Lines—We and others have been studying the induction of apoptosis by ATO in MM cell lines and while most studies clearly point to induction of caspase activation, it is not clear what the initiating events that ultimately result in caspase activation are or what factors may regulate this signaling (5Bahlis N.J.

Jung C.W. Lee C.C. Kim B.K. Lee Y.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3065-3071PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, we performed an analysis of the gene expression profile in response to ATO. We elected to do this analysis in four MM cell lines that display two different sensitivities to ATO. All four cell lines were sensitive to ATO in a time (Fig. 1) and dose-dependent manner (28Morales A.A. Gutman D. Lee K.P. Boise L.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 5152-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, two cell lines (U266 and 8226/S) were less sensitive than the other two cell lines. This is exemplified at 48 h where the percent of control viability for U266, MM.1s, 8226/S and KMS11 were 61.9 ± 5.1, 26.9 ± 6.0, 57.5 ± 6.4 and 21.9 ± 3.7%, respectively.To study the ATO response, cells were treated with 2 μm ATO for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h, and total RNA was obtained for probing Affymetrix Hu133 2.0 Plus Arrays. Ratios at 6, 24, and 48 h versus baseline gene expression were calculated and up- and down-regulation was initially considered as a 2-fold change from the baseline expression. Interestingly, MM.1s and KMS11, the more sensitive cell lines, displayed a larger number of genes up- or down-regulated compared with U266 and 8226/S. However, given the number of changes observed in 3 of 4 individual cell lines, the data sets were too complex to determine if a pattern of expression consistent with an ATO myeloma response exists (Table 1). Therefore, to develop a more manageable data set, we elected to initially focus on genes that were regulated in a similar fashion in all four cell lines. However, this number appeared to be restricted by the relatively low number of genes that changed in 8226/S cells. Therefore, we expanded this data set to include all genes that changed (I or D call) regardless of the magnitude of the change. This resulted in a data set that contained no more than 343 up-regulated genes and 318 down-regulated genes (Table 1). The complete list of these up- and down-regulated genes can be found in the supplemental Table S1 and S2. Interestingly, the peak of up-regulated genes occurred early. This was in part due to a subset of genes that were up-regulated at 6 h and then returned to baseline expression. This group consisted primarily of heat shock proteins (HSPs, see supplemental Table S1). Many of the other genes that were up-regulated were consistent with an antioxidant response, including NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 and 2 (NQO1 and NQO2), HO-1, and metallothionein-1 and 2A (MT1 and MT2A).TABLE 1Number of up- and down-regulated probes during ATO-induced apoptosis in U266, MM.1s, 8226/S, and KMS11 cell lines at 6, 24, and 48 hChangesU266MM.1s8226/SKMS11ALLUp6 h1471 (245)aThe numbers of probe sets that were increased or decreased by 2-fold or greater are shown in parentheses3120 (730)1646 (262)3263 (961)343 (55)24 h2644 (396)2763 (641)722 (81)2514 (602)176 (35)48 h2824 (606)3201 (823)1333 (204)3002 (1076)272 (46)Down6 h2048 (243)3001 (648)1798 (143)2933 (544)282 (10)24 h2740 (555)2893 (648)1217 (92)3093 (601)286 (6)48 h3059 (791)3228 (1120)1817 (186)3263 (1145)318 (7)a The numbers of probe sets that were increased or decreased by 2-fold or greater are shown in parentheses Open table in a new tab NQO1 was up-regulated at the mRNA level in all four cell lines as early as in 6 h (supplemental Table S1). Interestingly, in U266 and MM.1s, NQO1 protein was not present or up-regulated after ATO treatment and in 8226/S and KMS11 was up-regulated only after 24 h ATO treatment (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that NQO1 is unlikely to be related with any protection from this antioxidant response. Therefore, we initially focused on the two most up-regulated genes HO-1 and metallothioneins (MTs).FIGURE 2Induction of HO-1 is not protective against ATO-induced apoptosis in MM cell lines. U266, MM.1s, 8226/S and KMS11 were treated for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h with 2 μm ATO. Total protein lysates were obtained and NQO1 (A) and HO-1 (B) protein expression was determined by Western blot. KMS11 treated with ATO for 24 h was used as a positive control for the U266 and MM.1s NQO1 blot. C, U266 cell line was pretreated for 24 h with 50, 100, and 200 μm of hemin and HO-1 protein up-regulation was demonstrated by Western blot. Cells treated with ATO for 24 h were used as a positive control. Hemin-pretreated U266 cells were treated with 2 μm ATO for 24 h and viability was evaluated by Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. D, U266 cell line was stably transfected with pcDNA3-HO-1 or an empty vector control (Neo). Expression of HO-1 was confirmed by Western blot. U266, U266-Neo, and U266-HO-1 were treated with 2 μm ATO for the indicated time and viability was evaluated by annexin-V-FITC/PI staining. Percent (%) of control viability was plotted versus time (h). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ATO-induced Up-regulation of HO-1 Is Not Protective against Cell Death—HO-1 was strongly up-regulated in all four cell lines, not only at the mRNA level (Table S1) but also at protein level (Fig. 2B). A second band of ∼25 kDa was obtained at 24 and 48 h, coinciding with caspase activation. Inhibition of caspases with BocD-Fmk, prevented the appearance of this band and suggests that it is a result of caspase-dependent cleavage of HO-1 (not shown). Interestingly, the HO-1 baseline expression was higher in U266 and 8226/S than in MM.1s and KMS11, suggesting that HO-1 could be protective against ATO. This is consistent with a previous report demonstrating HO-1 expression in the surviving fraction of cells treated for 7 days with ATO (15Zhou P. Kalakonda N. Comenzo R.L. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 128: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We tested this possibility by determining the effect of pretreating cells with hemin to induce HO-1 protein expression. Pretreatment of U266 (Fig. 2C) and MM.1s (not shown) cell lines, with hemin at 50, 100, and 200 μm for 24 h, induced up-regulation of HO-1 at the protein level, in a dose-dependent manner. Regardless, hemin-pretreated U266 cell line remained sensitive to ATO (Fig. 2C). Similar findings were observed with MM.1s (not shown). We next directly tested the effect of HO-1 on ATO-induced death by stably transfecting cells with an HO-1 expression vector. Western blot analysis demonstrated overexpression of HO-1 protein (Fig. 2D) in the U266-HO-1 cell line compared with the U266-Neo cell line. Consistent with induction of HO-1 by hemin, overexpression of HO-1 was not protective against ATO-induced cell death (Fig. 2D).ATO-induced Up-regulation of MTs Is Also Not Protective— MT1 gene expression was measured by RT-PCR at 0, 6, 24, and 48 h after ATO treatment, for U266, MM.1s, and 8226/S. Up-regulation of the MT1 gene was observed in the three cell lines tested, as early as 6 h (Fig. 3A), confirming the microarray data obtained for all four cell lines (supplemental Table S1). To test if MT1 and/or MT2A are protective, the mRNA was up-regulated using ZnCl2 pretreatment for 24 h, and gene expression was determined by real-time PCR. As seen in Fig. 3B both MT1H and MT2A are induced by ATO and ZnCl2. Similar results were obtained for MM.1s (not shown). However, when ZnCl2-pretreated cells were tested for ATO-induced apoptosis and no differences were found compared with untreated cells as control (Fig. 3C and not shown).FIGURE 3MT induction does not protect cells from ATO-induced cell death. A, U266, MM.1s, and 8226/S were treated for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h with 2 μm ATO, and total RNA was obtained. RT-PCR for MT1 and GAPDH was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, U266 was treated with 25, 50, and 100 μm of ZnCl2, and MT1H and MT2A gene expression was measured by real-time PCR. C, untreated and ZnCl2-pretreated U266 cells were treated with 2 μm ATO for 24 h, and viability was evaluated by annexin-V-FITC/PI staining. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ATO Induces an Antioxidant Response Related to the Activation of Nrf2—A closer analysis of the array data results revealed the common up- and down-regulation of a subset of genes related to the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. A supervised clustering of known target and related genes indicated activation of this pathway (Fig. 4). Down-regulated genes are consistent with transcriptional repression of genes involved in the cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic pathways. Up-regulated genes included: MTs, HO-1, and related enzymes (biliverdin reductase B, ferritin, and pirin iron-binding nuclear protein), NQO1, and NQO2, NADPH-generating enzymes (malic enzyme), and genes related to the GSH de novo synthesis and salvage pathways as well as enzymes and carriers that would facilitate synthesis and t"

In the present study, we examined whether nuclear actions of the incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1, involve modulation of β-cell chromatin structure. Stimulation of INS-1(832/13) β-cells or dispersed mouse islets with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide or glucagon-like peptide-1 resulted in the post-translational modification of core H3 histones, through acetylation and phosphorylation. Both increased histone H3 acetyltransferase and reduced histone deacetylase activities contributed. Subsequent studies demonstrated that incretin-mediated histone H3 modifications involved activation of protein kinase A, p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p38 MAPK signaling modules, resulting in the activation of mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1. Additionally, modification of histone H3 increased its association with the transcription factor, phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (phospho-CREB) and with cAMP-responsive CREB coactivator 2. Incretin-activated CREB-related Bcl-2 transcription was greatly reduced by a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, demonstrating the functional importance of histone H3 modification. This appears to be the first demonstration of β-cell chromatin modification in response to the incretins and the studies indicate that their regulatory effects involve coordinated nuclear interactions between specific signaling modules, chromatin-modifying enzymes and transcription factors.

Recently, members of two classes of incretin-related compounds have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the incretin mimetic exenatide (Byetta™) and the DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin (Januvia™), resulting in a burgeoning interest in this class of hormones. Although significant progress has been made in incretin biology over the past few years, there is relatively little known about their mode of action in gene regulation. In the current study we examined the possible involvement of GIP and GLP-1 in β-cell chromatin modification. Eukaryotic chromatin is composed of an octamer of four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) around which 147 bp of DNA are wrapped. Chromatin can exert a regulatory effect on gene transcription by modulating accessibility of transcription factors to target genes (9Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Different post-translational modifications in the N termini of the histones have been identified, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, ADP-ribosylation, deamination, and proline isomerization, and these modifications have direct effects on gene expression (10Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar, 11Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 2: 142-148Crossref Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 12Bernstein B.E. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1167-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are involved in the acetylation of histone N termini, resulting in chromatin adopting an “open” conformation, whereas histone deacetylase (HDAC) generally promotes a “closed” conformation, by reversing the process (13Marmorstein R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Gregory P.D. Wagner K. Hörz W. Exp.

Histone H2B has been shown to be acetylated at lysine residues 5, 12, 15, and 20 (16Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 17Thorne A.W. Kmiciek D. Mitchelson K. Sautiere P. Crane-Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas histone H3 is acetylated at lysines 9, 14, 18, and 23 (18Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Among these sites, acetylation of H3 at Lys-9 has been considered to play a dominant role in histone deposition and chromatin assembly (18Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation at serine 10 and 28 and threonine 1 has been shown to be tightly regulated for chromosome condensation during cell cycle progression (19Hendzel M.J. Wei Y.

In the present study, we have shown that GIP and GLP-1 induce core histone H3 protein modifications through the regulation of histone H3 acetyltransferase (H3AT) and HDAC activity, and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38 MAPK, and mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK-1) signaling modules are involved in this process. Additionally, modification of histone H3 increased its association with the transcription factor, phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (phospho-CREB) and with cAMP-responsive CREB coactivator 2 (TORC2) in the nucleus. Incretin-mediated post-translational modification of core histones is therefore likely to be an important component of their effects on gene transcription in β-cells. Cell Culture—INS-1 β-cells (clone 832/13) were kindly provided by Dr. C. B. Newgard (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). INS-1 cells were cultured in 11 mm glucose RPMI 1640 (Sigma Laboratories, Natick, MA) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin G-sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell passages 45–70 were used. In incretin stimulation experiments a peptide concentration of 100 nm was used, because previous studies have demonstrated near-maximal β-cell responses at this concentration (7Kim S.J. Winter K.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1644-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Islet Isolation—Male C57BL/6 mice (12 weeks old, Charles River) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (30–40 mg/kg). Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and dispersed to single cells as described previously (22MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Dispersed islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 0.25% HEPES, 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G-sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear proteins were isolated as described by Schreiber et al. (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted with 200 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Following centrifugation, the resulting pellet was re-suspended in 20 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After clarification of the mixture by centrifugation, the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected and subjected to Western blot analysis or enzyme activity assay. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were separated on a 13% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Probing of the membranes was performed with acetyl-histone H3 (Lys-9), acetyl-histone H3 (Lys-18), acetyl-histone H3 (Lys-23), phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10), histone 3, and HDAC1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -7 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies. Confocal Microscopy—INS-1 cells were treated with GIP or GLP-1 (100 nm) for 24 h. Following treatment, immunocytochemical staining was performed using antibodies against acetyl-histone Lys-9, acetyl-histone Lys-18, or phospho-histone H3 Ser-10 and insulin and visualized with Texas Red® dye-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and Alexa fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Stained cells were imaged using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Axioskop2). All imaging data were analyzed using the Northern Eclipse program (version 6). HDAC, H3AT, and MSK-1 Activity Assays—The HDAC (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), H3AT (Active motif), and MSK-1 FP Fluorescein Green assay kit, KinEASE™ (Millipore) were used to measure enzyme activity of HDAC, H3AT, and MSK-1, according to the manufacturer's protocols. Enzyme activity is presented as relative activity normalized to protein concentration. Co-immunoprecipitation—Following treatment, nuclear extracts were isolated, and acetylated histones H3 at Lys-9, Lys-18, or phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser-10 were respectively immunoprecipitated, using Dynabead protein A (Invitrogen) and anti-acetyl histone H3 Lys-9, Lys-18, or anti-phospho histone H3 Ser-10 antibody. The precipitated products were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133) or anti-TORC2 antibody. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted, and cDNA fragments were generated by reverse transcription. 100 ng of cDNA was used in the real-time PCR to measure Bcl-2 expression, whereas 10 ng of cDNA was used in the 18 S rRNA control PCR. The primer and probe sequences used for the amplification of Bcl-2 were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CTG AGT ACC TGA ACC GGC ATC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGG CCC AGG TAT GCA CCC AGA-3′; probe, 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-CCC CAG CAT GCG ACC TCT GTT TG-3′-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. All reactions followed the typical sigmoidal reaction profile, and cycle threshold was used as a measurement of amplicon abundance. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. with the number of individual experiments presented in the figure legends. Significance was tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls post hoc test (p < 0.05) as indicated in the figure legends. Effect of Incretins on Histone H3 Modification in Pancreatic β-Cells—The effects of GIP and GLP-1 on the post-translational modification of histone H3 in INS-1 (832/13) β-cells were first determined. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), both GIP and GLP-1 (100 nm) treatment increased acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 and Lys-18 and phosphorylation at Ser-10, whereas there were no significant changes in acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-23. Acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 and Lys-18 and phosphorylation at Ser-10 demonstrated concentration-dependent responses to GIP or GLP-1 (supplemental Fig. S1). Immunocytochemical staining of INS-1 (832/13) β-cells confirmed the effects of incretins on histone H3 detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Similar histone modification results were observed with dispersed mouse islets. Both incretins increased acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 and Lys-18 and phosphorylation at Ser-10. On the other hand, there were no significant changes in acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-23 (Fig. 1D). Effect of Incretins on the Activity of HDACs and H3AT—The effects of GIP and GLP-1 on protein levels or activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes were next studied. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), there were no significant changes in the protein levels of class 1 HDACs, HDAC1, -2, and -3 or the class 2 HDACs, HDAC4, -5, and -7 (24Gray S.G. Ekström T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 25Thiagalingam S. Cheng K.H. Lee H.J. Mineva N. Thiagalingam A. Ponte J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 983: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) following treatment of INS-1 (832/13) β-cells with GIP or GLP-1 (100 nm) for 24 h. However, identical treatment conditions resulted in small, but significant (p < 0.05), decreases in HDAC activity (Fig. 2C). By contrast, incretin treatment resulted in marked increases in H3AT activity that was significant (p < 0.05) by 4 h with GLP-1 and for both peptides by 24 h (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that incretin hormones modulate β-cell chromatin structure by regulating the activity of both the HDAC and H3AT families of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Signaling Modules Involved in Incretin-mediated Histone H3 Modification in Pancreatic β-Cells—Both GIP and GLP-1 activate a number of signal transduction pathways in β-cells, and the potential involvement in histone H3 modification of PKA, p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway activation (6Ehses J.A.

GIP- and GLP-1-stimulated acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 and Lys-18, but not Lys-23, was greatly reduced or ablated by inhibitors of PKA (H-89; 10 μm), MAPK kinase (MEK) 1/2 (PD098059; 75 μm), and p38 MAPK (SB203580; 10 μm), whereas the SAPK/JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (50 μm), was without effect. Phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 in response to GIP and GLP-1, was greatly reduced by all four inhibitors (Fig. 3, A–D). The observation that PKA, p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK protein kinases are involved in incretin-mediated histone H3 modification led us to examine whether they are also involved in incretin-mediated activation/inactivation of H3AT and HDAC in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 4 (A–D), inhibition of PKA, MEK1/2, and p38 MAPK reversed the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of GIP and GLP-1 on HDAC and H3AT activities, respectively; SAPK/JNK inhibition was without effect on the modulation of either enzyme. Multiple signaling modules are therefore involved in incretin-mediated activation/inactivation of H3AT/HDAC, resulting in the post-translational modification of histone H3 core proteins.FIGURE 4PKA, p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK are involved in incretin-mediated activation/inactivation of H3AT/HDAC.

INS-1 (832/13) cells were serum-starved in 3 mm glucose RPMI containing 0.1% BSA overnight and stimulated for 24 h with 100 nm GIP or GLP-1 in the presence or absence of inhibitors of PKA, p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK. H-89 (10 μm), PD98059 (75 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), and SP600125 (50 μm) were added to cells during 1-h preincubation as well as during GIP or GLP-1 stimulation.

Significance was tested using ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post hoc test; **, p < 0.05 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Potential Involvement of MSK-1 in Incretin-mediated Histone H3 Modification in Pancreatic β-Cells—The serine/threonine protein kinase MSK-1 has been shown to be activated by PKA, P42/44 MAPK, p38MAPK, or SAPK2 in responses to stress or mitogenic extracellular stimuli (31Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 32Delghandi M.P. Johannessen M. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Its potential involvement in incretin-mediated histone H3 modification in pancreatic β-cells was therefore studied. INS-1 (832/13) β-cells were treated with GIP or GLP-1 (100 nm), and Western blot analyses were performed using antibodies against phospho-MSK-1 (Ser-376). As shown in Fig. 5A, GIP stimulated phosphorylation of MSK-1 at Ser-376, with phosphorylation apparent 10 min after initiation of GIP treatment, and thereafter sustained until the end of 1-h incubation. Slightly weaker GLP-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Ser376 MSK-1 was observed, with phosphorylation apparent 20 min after initiation of GLP-1 treatment, and thereafter sustained to 30-min incubation (Fig. 5B). The phosphorylation of Ser-376 in MSK-1 correlated well with MSK-1 enzymatic activity: Treatment of INS-1 cells with GIP or GLP-1 for 30 min resulted in 2.5- and 2.2-fold increases in MSK-1 activity, respectively (Fig. 5C). MSK-1 Ser-376 is a PKA consensus site, and the inhibitor H-89 was initially employed to examine the potential involvement of the kinase in incretin stimulation of MSK-1 activity in INS-1 (832/13) β-cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, MSK-1 activity in response to GIP or GLP-1 was greatly reduced by H-89. Because H-89 has also been reported to act as a direct inhibitor of MSK-1, Rp-cAMPs, a specific competitive inhibitor of cAMP binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA, was additionally employed. Rp-cAMPs also inhibited GIP- or GLP-1-induced stimulation of MSK-1 activity (Fig. 5D), and both inhibitors ablated incretin-stimulated acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 and Lys-18, and phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that both PKA and MSK-1 are involved in incretin-mediated histone H3 modification. Direct Protein-Protein Interactions between Acetylated/Phosphorylated Histone H3 and Phospho-CREB or TORC2 in the Nucleus—The functional implications of incretin-mediated post-translational modification of histone H3 were next determined. It was previously demonstrated that GIP increases protein-protein interactions between phospho-CREB and TORC2 (8Kim S.J. Nian C. Widenmaier S. McIntosh C.H.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1644-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the current study, INS-1 (832/13) β-cells were treated with GIP or GLP-1 (100 nm) for 24 h, and nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against histone H3 acetylated at Lys-9 or Lys-18, or phosphorylated at Ser-10, followed by immunoblotting for CREB or TORC2. Both GIP and GLP-1 increased direct protein-protein interactions between phospho-CREB (Ser-133) and TORC2 with histone H3 acetylated at Lys-9 or Lys-18, or phosphorylated at Ser-10 (Fig. 6, A–F). To define functional consequences of incretin-mediated histone H3 acetylation on CREB/TORC2-responsive target gene expression, incretin-mediated Bcl-2 gene transcription was measured in the presence or absence of HAT inhibitor. Treatment of INS-1 cells with GIP or GLP-1 (100 nm) for 24 h resulted in 3- to 3.5-fold increases in Bcl-2 mRNA transcript levels, compared with controls, and incretin-mediated Bcl-2 gene transcription was greatly reduced by HAT inhibitor (Fig. 6G). Incretin-mediated histone H3 modification is therefore likely to be an important regulator of CREB-related transcription in pancreatic β-cells. Modulation of chromatin structure plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription in eukaryotes. Diverse post-translational modifications of core histone nuclear proteins have been found to be associated with both the active and inactive transcriptional status of target genes. These modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, are thought to result from promoter binding of transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor complexes possessing enzyme-modifying activity (33Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7825) Google Scholar, 34Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). Such complexes do not generally have direct DNA-binding activity, but are recruited to promoters by interaction with other sequence-specific transcription factors. The resulting modifications of the core histone proteins, in turn, modulate the access of further regulatory complexes to the promoter. This complicated interplay among regulatory complexes, promoter, and core histone proteins would be missed when transcriptional activation and transcription factor binding to target promoters are studied in vitro using naked DNA templates. In the present study, we examined the effects of the incretin hormones on post-translational modifications of histone proteins. Both GIP and GLP-1 decreased HDAC activity and increased H3AT activity in the nucleus (Fig. 2, C and D), resulting in increased acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 and Lys-18 (Fig. 1, A and D). Effects on the deacetylase activity were small compared with those on acetylation. The deacetylase HDAC1 has been shown to form HDAC1/protein phosphatase 1 complexes that are recruited by phospho-CREB, resulting in histone deacetylation and CREB dephosphorylation (35Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzmán E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates 3rd., J.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the small changes in activity observed were due to selective effects on HDAC1. It is not known whether the reduction in activity resulted from phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, or some other modification of the enzyme. Several of the histone deacetylase enzymes have been shown to undergo post-translational phosphorylation but, in the case of HDAC1 for example, phosphorylation does not appear to have a major effect on enzyme activity (36Cai R. Kwon P. Yan Y.-N. Sambuccetti L. Fischer D. Cohen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Karnwowska-Desaulniers P. Ketko A. Kamath N. Pflum K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Neither GIP nor GLP-1 was found to impact on protein levels of a number of HDAC enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B); H3AT proteins were not studied due to the large number of potential enzymes with histone acetylase activity. Although treatment of INS-1 (832/13) β-cells with both GIP and GLP-1 (100 nm) for 24 h resulted in a substantial increase in histone H3 acetylation at Lys-18, only GLP-1, and not GIP, increased histone H3 acetylation at Lys-18 at 4 h treatment (Fig. 1A). Although the actions of GIP on pancreatic β-cells have been reported to be analogous to those of GLP-1, these results suggest the presence of complicated and selective mechanisms for the regulation of incretin-mediated histone H3 modification and target gene expression. Several kinases have been proposed to be responsible for phosphorylation of histone 3, including RSK2, a member of the p90rsk (ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)) family (38Merienne K. Pannetier S. Harel-Bellan A. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7089-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), MSK-1, and MSK-2 (39Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). There now appears to be a consensus that MSK-1 and MSK-2 are the major kinases phosphorylating Ser-10 (40Davie J.R. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : PE33Google Scholar, 41Chwang W.B. Arthur J.S. Schumacher A.

Both p38 MAPK and MEK/ERK pathways have been shown to activate MSK-1 in different cell types, and the current inhibitor studies provided support for the involvement of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK in incretin-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-10 (Fig. 3, A–D) in INS-1 (832/13) β-cells. Incretin-stimulated histone H3 acetylation at Lys-9 and Lys-18, as well as the modulation of H3AT and HDAC activity (Fig. 4, A–D), were also blocked by PKA, MEK1/2, and p38 MAPK inhibition. There are a number of ways by which these signaling modules may regulate H3AT and HDAC activity. One possibility is that H3AT and HDAC activities are modulated by direct phosphorylation of the enzymes. There is growing evidence that the acetyltransferase activity of p300 is increased through phosphorylation pathways involving p38 MAPK (42Saha N.H. Jana M. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7101-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), protein kinase B (43Huang W.C. Chen C.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6592-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and ERK2 (44Chen Y.J. Wang V.N. Chang E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27215-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and it is possible that MSK-1 is the final mediator (41Chwang W.B. Arthur J.S. Schumacher A. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12732-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both GIP and GLP-1 increased MSK-1 activity (Fig. 5C), and H-89 ablated their ability to stimulate MSK-1 activity and histone H3 modification (Fig. 5E), in agreement with their ability to stimulate PKA activity. However, because H89 is also an inhibitor of MSK-1, its use did not allow discrimination between PKA and MSK-1 as the distal kinase. Application of Rp-cAMPs, a competitive inhibitor of cAMP binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA, also blocked incretin-mediated stimulation of MSK-1 activity, as well as histone H3 acetylation and phosphorylation in response to GIP or GLP-1. We therefore propose a model in which GIP and GLP-1 activate MSK-1 via PKA, with MSK-1 as the final mediator responsible for histone H3 modification (Fig. 7). The events involved in linking upstream stimulation of PKA and MSK-1 activity to the processes involved in histone modification, and their timing, are currently unknown. The changes in H3AT/HDAC activity, and increased histone H3 acetylation, may also be partially secondary to increased phosphorylation of the transcription machinery. The transcription coactivator paralogs, CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, possess HAT activity, and they have been shown to specifically bind to CREB phosphorylated at Ser-133. This phosphorylation-dependent interaction with CBP/p300 is critical for stimulus-induced activation of CREB (46Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), and, in turn, CBP/p300 increase histone acetylation, during the burst phase of gene transcription (49Michael L.F. Asahara H. Shulman A.I. Kraus W.L. Montminy M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HDAC1 has been shown to promote Ser-133 dephosphorylation via a stable interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (35Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzmán E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates 3rd., J.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the present study, GIP and GLP-1 were found to increase direct nuclear protein-protein interactions between phospho-CREB (Ser-133) (Fig. 6, A–C) or TORC2 (Fig. 6, D–F) and histone H3 acetylated at Lys-9 and Lys-18 or phosphorylated at Ser-10, suggesting that incretin-mediated histone H3 modification contributes significantly to the recruitment of transcription-related proteins. Although the level of histone acetylation is of clear importance for the regulation of gene expression, changes in the relative balance between acetylation and deacetylation have also been shown to significantly impact on pancreatic β-cell death. Inhibition of HDACs was demonstrated to prevent cytokine-induced β-cell apoptosis and impaired β-cell function through a down-regulation of NFκB trans-activating activity (45Larsen L. Tonnesen M. Ronn S.G. Størling J. Jørgensen S. Mascagni P. Dinarello C.A. Billestrup N. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that GIP up-regulates expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in β-cells (8Kim S.J. Nian C. Widenmaier S. McIntosh C.H.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1644-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and administration of an HAT inhibitor has now been shown to reduce GIP or GLP-1 stimulation of Bcl-2 gene expression, indicating involvement of histone modification. Because the present studies also indicate that incretin-stimulated pathways ultimately result in decreased HDAC activity and increased H3AT activity, as well as increased interaction between acetyl-histone H3 and phospho-CREB/TORC2 (Fig. 4), HDAC inhibitors may potentiate their protective effect on pancreatic β-cells. Finally, in view of the increasing interest in long acting incretins and DPP-IV inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes, it will be important to establish how the signaling cascades, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and transcriptional machinery act coordinately to translate incretin-mediated effects on target gene expression in pancreatic β-cells.

https://openalex.org/W2090936597,"The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor and its family members, p107 and p130, function by repressing E2F transcription factor activity to limit the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression. Traditionally, it is thought that the RB family proteins repress E2F target gene expression through complexing with E2F at gene promoters. However, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated p107 and p130 at E2F-responsive promoters, RB chromatin association has not been reliably observed. Here we used green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins to rigorously explore the mechanism of RB-mediated transcriptional repression relative to its p107 and p130 family members. The use of live cell fluorescent imaging demonstrated that RB, p107, and p130 exhibit similar nuclear dynamics. Although these findings suggest a similar engagement with nuclear structures, chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches with multiple independent antibodies failed to detect the association of RB with target gene promoters. However, by employing antibodies directed against green fluorescent protein, we could utilize the same antibody to assess RB, p107, and p130 engagement. This approach demonstrated RB association with target gene promoters in a fashion analogous to p107 and p130. Extension of this technology demonstrated that direct RB phosphorylation disrupts promoter association to regulate transcription. Thus, RB is associated with promoters in a manner similar to p107/p130 and that association is modulated by phosphorylation during cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1982080048,"Vertebrates produce at least seven distinct β-tubulin isotypes that coassemble into all cellular microtubules. The functional differences among these tubulin isoforms are largely unknown, but recent studies indicate that tubulin composition can affect microtubule properties and cellular microtubule-dependent behavior. One of the isotypes whose incorporation causes the largest change in microtubule assembly is β5-tubulin. Overexpression of this isotype can almost completely destroy the microtubule network, yet it appears to be required in smaller amounts for normal mitotic progression. Moderate levels of overexpression can also confer paclitaxel resistance. Experiments using chimeric constructs and site-directed mutagenesis now indicate that the hypervariable C-terminal region of β5 plays no role in these phenotypes. Instead, we demonstrate that two residues found in β5 (Ser-239 and Ser-365) are each sufficient to inhibit microtubule assembly and confer paclitaxel resistance when introduced into β1-tubulin; yet the single mutation of residue Ser-239 in β5 eliminates its ability to confer these phenotypes. Despite the high degree of conservation among β-tubulin isotypes, mutations affecting residue 365 demonstrate that amino acid substitutions can be context sensitive; i.e. an amino acid change in one isotype will not necessarily produce the same phenotype when introduced into a different isotype. Modeling studies indicate that residue Cys-239 of β1-tubulin is close to a highly conserved Cys-354 residue suggesting the possibility that disulfide formation could play a significant role in the stability of microtubules formed with β1- but not with β5-tubulin.

Microtubules are needed to organize the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, maintain cell shape, construct ciliary and flagellar axonemes, and ensure the accurate segregation of genetic material prior to cell division. These cytoskeletal structures assemble from α- and β-tubulin heterodimers to form long cylindrical filaments that exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium characterized by stochastic episodes of slow growth and rapid shrinkage (1Mitchison T. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Impairment of normal dynamic behavior has serious consequences for cell proliferation and thus makes microtubules an attractive target for drug development (2Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Vertebrates express multiple β-tubulin genes that produce highly homologous proteins differing most notably in their C-terminal 15–20 amino acids (3Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These variable C-terminal sequences are conserved across vertebrate species and have been used to classify β-tubulin genes into distinct isotypes (5Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In mammals, for example, there are seven known isotypes designated by the numbers I, II, III, IVa, IVb, V, and VI. The functional significance of the C-terminal sequences is uncertain, but some studies suggest that they may be involved in binding or modulating the action of microtubule-interacting proteins (6Lu C.

Additional amino acid differences are scattered throughout the primary sequence, but the functional role of these differences, if any, has not been elucidated. Although some β-tubulin isotypes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (3Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), evidence indicates that microtubules incorporate all available isotypes, including transfected isotypes that are not normally produced in those cells (5Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W.

Genetic experiments designed to test potential functional differences among the various β-tubulin isotypes have only demonstrated isotype-specific effects on the assembly of specialized microtubule-containing structures such as flagellar axonemes in Drosophila or 15-protofilament microtubules in Caenorhabditis elegans (18Hoyle H.D. Raff E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1009-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Savage C. Hamelin M. Culotti J.G. Coulson A. Albertson D.G. Chalfie M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, the consequences, if any, of producing multiple β-tubulin isoforms in vertebrate organisms remain elusive. Our recent work showed that conditional overexpression of isotypes β1, β2, and β4b has no effect on microtubule assembly or drug sensitivity in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 2The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; αMEM, α-minimum essential medium; β1, Class I β-tubulin; β5, Class V β-tubulin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; Ptx, paclitaxel; MTB, microtubule buffer; tet, tetracycline; tTA, tetracycline-regulated transactivator; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; αMEM, α-minimum essential medium; β1, Class I β-tubulin; β5, Class V β-tubulin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; Ptx, paclitaxel; MTB, microtubule buffer; tet, tetracycline; tTA, tetracycline-regulated transactivator; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. cells (20Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of neuronal-specific β4a produced very minor effects on microtubule assembly but was able to increase sensitivity to paclitaxel, most likely through increased binding of the drug (21Yang H. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27058-27066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, high expression of neuronal-specific β3 reduced microtubule assembly, conferred low level resistance to paclitaxel, and inhibited cell growth (22Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The most dramatic effects, however, were seen in cells transfected with β5, a minor but widely expressed isotype (23Sullivan K.F. Havercroft J.C. Machlin P.S. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 4409-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Even modest overexpression of this isotype reduced microtubule assembly and conferred paclitaxel resistance, whereas high levels of expression (∼50% of total tubulin) caused fragmentation and a near complete loss of the microtubule cytoskeleton (24Bhattacharya R. Cabral F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3123-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite the toxicity associated with β5 overexpression, this isotype was recently shown to be required for normal mitotic progression and cell proliferation (25Bhattacharya R. Frankfurter A. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2008; 65: 708-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because of its importance for cell division, and the extreme phenotype associated with its overexpression, we sought to identify the structural differences between β5-tubulin and its more “normal” homolog, β1. Although there are 40 amino acid differences between the 2 isotypes, we report that most of the unique properties of β5 can be attributed to the presence of serine in place of cysteine at residue 239. This residue faces the colchicine binding pocket and is very close to a highly conserved Cys-354 residue. We propose that Ser-239 found in β5-tubulin may prevent formation of a disulfide bond that normally stabilizes microtubules. Construction of HA-tagged β1/β5 Chimeric Tubulin Genes— The starting materials for the generation of chimeric tubulins were a CHO β1-tubulin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U08342) and a mouse β5-tubulin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number BC008225). Both cDNAs were modified to encode a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag to facilitate separation and detection of the transfected tubulin and were cloned into a pTOPneo vector to permit tetracycline-regulated expression (26Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Chang L. Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23875-23882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Prior to the generation of chimeras, the pTOPHAβ1 was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to remove a BamHI site at the 5′-end of CHO HAβ1 cDNA, and the resulting plasmid was named pTOPHAβ1-BamHI. Subsequent steps utilized two conserved internal restriction sites, BspHI (at codon 163) and BamHI (at codon 344), to generate six distinct chimeras named according to the isotype sequences present in the N-terminal (amino acids 1–163), central (amino acids 164–344), and C-terminal (amino acids 345–444/447) regions of the protein. For example, HAβ151 contains β1 sequences at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions with a β5 sequence in the middle. Restriction enzymes were from Promega (Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis of various constructs was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transfection and Isolation of Stable Transfected Cell Lines— CHO tTA cells harboring the tetracycline-regulated transactivator (26Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Chang L. Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23875-23882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were transfected with different chimeric β-tubulin-containing plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Following transfection, the cells were maintained in αMEM (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, W. Sacramento, CA). To determine the efficiency of transfection, a sterile coverslip was placed in the dish prior to seeding the cells, and the percentage of cells expressing the transfected tubulin was determined by immunofluorescence using a rabbit antibody against the HA tag (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) followed by an Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). To obtain stably transfected cells, the transfected population was replated in 60-mm dishes containing αMEM, tetracycline (1 μg/ml), and G418 (2 mg/ml). After 7–8 days resistant colonies were isolated and screened for expression of the HAβ-tubulin or pooled and maintained as a total G418-resistant population. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips in αMEM for 48–72 h, washed in PBS, and extracted in MTB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 4 μg/ml paclitaxel for 2 min at 4 °C. Fixation was carried out in methanol at -20 °C for 15 min followed by rehydration in PBS for 10–15 min. The fixed cells were incubated in PBS containing 1:100 dilutions of mouse α-tubulin antibody DM1A (Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit HA antibody (Bethyl) for 1 h at 37 °C in a humid chamber. The coverslips were then washed in PBS and incubated for an additional hour in 1:100 dilutions of Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) as well as DAPI (1 μg/ml). After washing in PBS the coverslips were inverted onto 5 μl of mounting medium (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), and were viewed by epifluorescence using an Optiphot microscope (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with a Plan Apochromat 60× 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective and filters to minimize cross-talk between channels. Colony Formation Assay—Approximately 100–200 cells were seeded into the first well of a 12-well dish containing αMEM plus 1 μg/ml tetracycline to inhibit the expression of the transgene. This well was used as a control to estimate the number of viable cells plated. Two additional wells received 10 times as many cells in αMEM containing 200 nm paclitaxel with or without 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The cells were incubated until colonies were visible (7–9 days), the medium was removed, and the cells were stained with a solution of 0.05% methylene blue in water as described previously (27Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The plates were rinsed gently with water to remove excess stain, dried, and photographed. Electrophoresis and Western Blots—CHO tTA cells or the same cells transfected with HAβ-tubulin cDNAs were grown in 24-well dishes and lysed in 1% SDS. Proteins were precipitated by adding 5 volumes of acetone, resuspended in 1× sample buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), fractionated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS minigel, and transferred to PROTRAN nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). The membranes were blocked by incubating in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% dry milk. After washing in PBST three times the membranes were incubated 1 h in a 1:5,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody 18D6 specific for the N-terminal amino acids of all β-tubulin isoforms (28Theodorakis N.G. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 791-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1:25,000 dilution of actin-specific mouse monoclonal antibody C4 (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) was also added to act as an internal control. After washing 3 times in PBST, the blots were incubated 1 h in a 1:2,000 dilution of Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Immunoreactive bands were detected by capturing fluorescence emission on a STORM 860 imager (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). In some experiments, α-or β-tubulin was detected using mouse antibodies DM1A and Tub 2.1 (Sigma). Measurement of Polymerized and Unpolymerized Tubulin— Cells were grown in 24-well dishes for 2 days and lysed in 100 μl of MTB buffer containing 0.14 m NaCl and 4 μg/ml paclitaxel to keep the polymerized microtubules intact (29Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized cells were scraped from the wells and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Residual material was washed from the wells with 100 μl of the lysis buffer and mixed with the initial lysate. To solubilize any remaining residue, 100 μl of 1% SDS was added to the wells. The lysates were briefly mixed and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants carrying the unpolymerized tubulin were transferred to fresh tubes. The pellets containing the polymerized tubulin were resuspended in 50 μl water and combined with the residues solubilized in SDS from the corresponding wells. To each sample (supernatant and pellet) 4 μl of a bacterial lysate containing GST-α-tubulin was added as a control for any losses incurred in subsequent steps. Proteins were precipitated using 5 volumes of acetone and resuspended in 30 μl of 1× sample buffer. Equal volumes of samples were fractionated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS minigel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane-bound proteins were incubated with mouse antibodies DM1A (α-tubulin) and C4 (actin), followed by Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as described above. Bands corresponding to α-tubulin, GST-α-tubulin, and actin were quantified by using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) using the “gelplot1” macro. The percentage of tubulin polymerized into microtubules was calculated by normalizing tubulin in the supernatant and pellet fractions to the amount of GST-α-tubulin, dividing the normalized value from the pellet by the sum of the values from supernatant and pellet, and multiplying the fraction by 100. Construction of Chimeric HAβ-tubulins—We previously reported that elevated production of β5-tubulin causes microtubule disruption and paclitaxel resistance in transfected cells (24Bhattacharya R. Cabral F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3123-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas transfection of β1, β2, and β4b isotypes does not (20Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to identify the structural elements that might account for the unique effects of β5, we aligned its amino acid sequence with β1, the most abundant and widely distributed isotype. Excluding the hypervariable region at the C-terminal end, 29 internal amino acid differences (conserved plus non-conserved) were found (Fig. 1). Because we didn't know whether the phenotypes conferred by overexpression of β5 were the result of single or multiple amino acid differences, we began our search for the relevant changes by carrying out domain swapping experiments between β5- and β1-tubulin. Two conserved endonuclease sites, BspH1 (codon 163) and BamH1 (codon 344), were found that allowed us to create 6 in-frame chimeric β-tubulin cDNAs. Each chimera was named according to the isotype sequence present in each of three segments beginning with the N terminus; e.g. β515 has β5 at the N and C termini with a β1 sequence in the center (Fig. 2). All the different chimeric cDNAs were sequenced to make sure they were in-frame and would produce the desired fusion proteins. To aid in identifying and measuring their levels of expression, the chimeric β-tubulin cDNAs were constructed to encode an HA tag at the C-terminal end of the proteins. Production of tubulin containing the C-terminal HA tag also served as confirmation that the cDNAs were in-frame. The Central and the C-terminal Regions of β5-Tubulin Contain Sequences That Cause Microtubule Disassembly—CHO cells stably transfected with each chimeric tubulin cDNA were selected using G418; tetracycline was also included to inhibit transcription of the transgene and thereby limit any potential toxicity. The G418-resistant cell populations were then tested for effects of chimeric β-tubulin gene expression on microtubule organization by incubating them in tetracycline-free media for 3 days to allow transgene expression and viewing the cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. As discussed in a previous publication (24Bhattacharya R. Cabral F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3123-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we were able to estimate the expression of ectopic β-tubulin based on dual staining with anti-HA tag (green fluorescence) and anti-α-tubulin (red fluorescence) antibodies. Using a triple bandpass filter, microtubules incorporating high levels of chimeric HAβ-tubulin appeared green, cells with intermediate levels of expression appeared yellow to orange, and cells with low expression appeared red. To maintain consistency in the analysis, we show only the cells that appeared green, i.e. had a high level of transgene expression, to illustrate results throughout the figures. Also note that in Fig. 2 the nuclei were pseudocolored red in place of the blue DAPI fluorescence to make them stand out more clearly. We found that all the chimeric tubulins except HAβ511 were able to induce microtubule disruption when expressed at high levels. The cells expressing HAβ511 (Fig. 2C) had microtubule assembly that was indistinguishable from wild-type or HAβ1 (Fig. 2A)-transfected cells indicating that amino acid differences in the N-terminal region of β5 are not sufficient to cause microtubule disruption. In contrast, cells producing chimeric tubulin that contained either the central or C-terminal region of β5 had disrupted microtubules and were multinucleated (Fig. 2, D–H), making their appearance similar to cells transfected with intact HAβ5 (Fig. 2B). Low expression of these hybrids produced little or no microtubule disassembly or multinucleation, whereas moderate expression produced intermediate phenotypes, thus indicating that the effects of expression were dose-dependent (data not shown). The presence of the N-terminal region of β5 with either the central or the C-terminal part, as in constructs HAβ551 and HAβ515, did not reverse the ability of those domains to disrupt microtubules. We concluded that the central and the C-terminal regions of β5, but not the N-terminal domain, must each contain at least one or more amino acids responsible for microtubule disassembly. The N-terminal Region of β5-Tubulin Is Required for Paclitaxel Resistance—Studies of numerous tubulin mutations have led to the observation that alterations in microtubule assembly are almost always accompanied by a change in cell sensitivity to agents that affect microtubule assembly (30Cabral F. Drug Resist. Updat. 2000; 3: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 31Cabral F. Fojo A.T. Cancer Drug Discovery and Development: The Role of Microtubules in Cell Biology, Neurobiology, and Oncology. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ2008: 337-356Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of β5-tubulin inhibited microtubule assembly and conferred paclitaxel resistance (24Bhattacharya R. Cabral F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3123-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether paclitaxel resistance is encoded within the same regions of β5 that encode microtubule disrupting activity, colony formation assays were performed by exposing transfected G418-resistant cell populations to a lethal dose of paclitaxel. The results summarized in Fig. 2 indicated that only cells transfected with HAβ551 (Fig. 2F′) and HAβ515 (Fig. 2G′) formed colonies in paclitaxel. Under identical conditions, cells expressing HAβ5 (Fig. 2B′) but not HAβ1 (Fig. 2A′) formed viable colonies in the drug. In all cases where tetracycline was added to inhibit expression of the ectopic tubulin, transfected cells failed to form colonies in paclitaxel indicating that transgene expression was necessary for drug resistance (data not shown). Given our previous experience, we found it surprising that three of the hybrid tubulins that disrupted microtubule assembly (HAβ151, HAβ115, and HAβ155) failed to confer resistance to paclitaxel. Although the N-terminal segment of β5 was not sufficient to cause microtubule disruption or confer paclitaxel resistance on its own (Fig. 2, C and C′), its presence in combination with either the central or the C-terminal domain was needed for drug resistance. The results suggest that interactions between the N-terminal domain and elements in the central and C-terminal domains cause differences in the response of microtubules to paclitaxel in each of the two isotypes. The Highly Divergent C-terminal Tail of β5 Is Not Involved in Microtubule Disruption or Drug Resistance—Apart from the very divergent last 15 amino acids, β1 and β5 tubulins differ at only 4 additional amino acids in the C-terminal fragment. Because there are so many differences clustered in the last 15 amino acids (see Fig. 1), we first sought to determine whether this region by itself could cause microtubule destabilization. Hence, two further chimeric tubulins were constructed: one in which amino acids 345–417 were from β5 and the rest of the C-terminal fragment was from β1 tubulin (HAβ1151), the other in which only amino acids 417–447 were from β5-tubulin (HAβ1115) (Fig. 3). Like the parental HAβ115 hybrid tubulin, transfection of HAβ1151 caused microtubule disruption and multinucleation (Fig. 3B). In contrast, transfection of HAβ1115 produced no phenotype (Fig. 3A). We therefore conclude that the divergent amino acids at the extreme C terminus play little if any role in the ability of β5-tubulin to cause microtubule disruption. We also did not find any effect of the extreme C-terminal tail on sensitivity to paclitaxel or colcemid (data not shown). Amino Acid 365 in the C-terminal Domain of β5 Is Implicated in Microtubule Disruption—The HAβ1151 construct that retained the ability to disrupt microtubule assembly encodes only 4 amino acids (Val-351, Ser-365, Ser-386, and Phe-398) that differ from β1-tubulin. To determine which of them are involved in destabilizing microtubules, we altered each of those amino acids in HAβ115 to the cognate amino acids in β1 tubulin, and transfected each construct into CHO cells to assess whether it was still capable of causing microtubule disruption. Of the four amino acid substitutions that were tested, only S365V caused a complete loss of the microtubule disrupting activity and left the cells with a normal diploid morphology (Fig. 4A). In contrast, V351T (Fig. 4B), S386T (Fig. 4C), and F398Y (not shown) substitutions did not prevent HAβ115 from disrupting microtubule assembly and cell morphology. We thus conclude that of all the isotype-specific amino acid differences in the C-terminal segment of HAβ115 tubulin, only Ser-365 is necessary for microtubule disruption. To determine whether alteration of residue 365 is sufficient to disrupt microtubule assembly, we produced a V365S substituted β1-tubulin in CHO cells and found that it potently disrupted the microtubule cytoskeleton (Fig. 4D). Amino Acid 239 in the Central Domain Strongly Affects Microtubule Assembly—Similar experiments were carried out with HAβ151 in an attempt to identify the critical amino acid residues in the central domain of β5 responsible for microtubule disruption. Sequence alignment between β1 and β5 identified 7 residues (170, 239, 275, 315, 320, 332, and 333) that differed between the 2 isotypes. Monosubstitution of each amino acid in HAβ151 with the corresponding amino acid in β1 failed to completely abolish the ability of the chimeric tubulin to disrupt microtubules, but an S239C substitution had the largest effect on reversing the phenotype (supplemental Fig. S1). Given the complexity of trying to eliminate the microtubule-disrupting activity of HAβ151, we instead created mutations in HAβ1-tubulin to look for gain of function. A C239S substitution caused the most microtubule disruption (Fig. 5A). It also caused problems in mitosis as evidenced by multiple large and oddly shaped nuclei in interphase cells. These multinucleated cells comprised 70% of the transfected cell population compared with only 7% for cells transfected with wild-type HAβ1. S275A, A315T, R320P, and V333I substitutions, on the other hand, had little or no discernible effect on the microtubule network (Fig. 5, B–E) and did not cause any increase in the percentage of cells that were multinucleated. Finally, V170M and N332A substitutions produced minimal disruption of the microtubules; but at especially high expression, multinucleated cells become more common and comprised 18–20% of the transfected cell population (Fig. 5, F, and G). We concluded from these observations that alteration of residues 275, 315, 320, and 333 had no obvious effect on microt"
https://openalex.org/W2049612999,"WARP is a recently identified extracellular matrix molecule with restricted expression in permanent cartilages and a distinct subset of basement membranes in peripheral nerves, muscle, and the central nervous system vasculature. WARP interacts with perlecan, and we also demonstrate here that WARP binds type VI collagen, suggesting a function in bridging connective tissue structures. To understand the in vivo function of WARP, we generated a WARP-deficient mouse strain. WARP-null mice were healthy, viable, and fertile with no overt abnormalities. Motor function and behavioral testing demonstrated that WARP-null mice exhibited a significantly delayed response to acute painful stimulus and impaired fine motor coordination, although general motor function was not affected, suggesting compromised peripheral nerve function. Immunostaining of WARP-interacting ligands demonstrated that the collagen VI microfibrillar matrix was severely reduced and mislocalized in peripheral nerves of WARP-null mice. Further ultrastructural analysis revealed reduced fibrillar collagen deposition within the peripheral nerve extracellular matrix and abnormal partial fusing of adjacent Schwann cell basement membranes, suggesting an important function for WARP in stabilizing the association of the collagenous interstitial matrix with the Schwann cell basement membrane. In contrast, other WARP-deficient tissues such as articular cartilage, intervertebral discs, and skeletal muscle showed no detectable abnormalities, and basement membranes formed normally. Our data demonstrate that although WARP is not essential for basement membrane formation or musculoskeletal development, it has critical roles in the structure and function of peripheral nerves."
https://openalex.org/W2161217137,"Along the lines of the ‘polluter pays principle’, it has recently been proposed that the local long-line fishing industry should fund eradication of terrestrial predators at seabird breeding colonies, as a compensatory measure for the bycatch caused by the fishing activity. The measure is economically sound, but a quantitative and reliable test of its biological efficacy has never been conducted. Here, we investigated the demographic consequences of predator eradication for Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea, breeding in the Mediterranean, using a population model that integrates demographic rates estimated from individual life-history information with experimental measures of predation and habitat structure. We found that similar values of population growth rate can be obtained by different combinations of habitat characteristics, predator abundance and adult mortality, which explains the persistence of shearwater colonies in islands with introduced predators. Even so, given the empirically obtained values of survival, all combinations of predator abundance and habitat characteristics projected a decline in shearwater numbers. Perturbation analyses indicated that the value and the sensitivity of shearwater population growth rates were affected by all covariates considered and their interactions. A decrease in rat abundance delivered only a small increase in the population growth rate, whereas a change in adult survival (a parameter independent of rat abundance) had the strongest impact on population dynamics. When adult survival is low, rat eradication would allow us to “buy” years before extinction but does not reverse the process. Rat eradication can therefore be seen as an emergency measure if threats on adult survival are eliminated in the medium-term period. For species with low fecundity and long life expectancy, our results suggest that rat control campaigns are not a sufficient, self-standing measure to compensate the biological toll of long-line fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2048581470,"N-Linked glycosylation involves the ordered, stepwise synthesis of the unique lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor Glc(3)Man(9) GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), catalyzed by a series of glycosyltransferases. Here we characterize Alg2 as a bifunctional enzyme that is required for both the transfer of the alpha1,3- and the alpha1,6-mannose-linked residue from GDP-mannose to Man(1)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol forming the Man(3)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol intermediate on the cytosolic side of the ER. Alg2 has a calculated mass of 58 kDa and is predicted to contain four transmembrane-spanning helices, two at the N terminus and two at the C terminus. Contradictory to topology predictions, we prove that only the two N-terminal domains fulfill this criterion, whereas the C-terminal hydrophobic sequences contribute to ER localization in a nontransmembrane manner. Surprisingly, none of the four domains is essential for transferase activity because truncated Alg2 variants can exert their function as long as Alg2 is associated with the ER by either its N- or C-terminal hydrophobic regions. By site-directed mutagenesis we demonstrate that an EX(7)E motif, conserved in a variety of glycosyltransferases, is not important for Alg2 function in vivo and in vitro. Instead, we identify a conserved lysine residue, Lys(230), as being essential for activity, which could be involved in the binding of the phosphate of the glycosyl donor."
https://openalex.org/W2132863642,"We generated transgenic mice that overexpressed gamma-(cyto) actin 2000-fold above wild-type levels in skeletal muscle. gamma-(cyto) actin comprised 40% of total actin in transgenic skeletal muscle, with a concomitant 40% decrease in alpha-actin. Surprisingly, transgenic muscle was histologically and ultrastructurally identical to wild-type muscle despite near-stoichiometric incorporation of gamma-(cyto) actin into sarcomeric thin filaments. Furthermore, several parameters of muscle physiological performance in the transgenic animals were not different from wild type. Given these surprising results, we tested whether overexpression of gamma-(cyto) actin could rescue the early postnatal lethality in alpha-(sk) actin-null mice (Acta1(-/-)). By quantitative Western blot analysis, we found total actin levels were decreased by 35% in Acta1(-/-) muscle. Although transgenic overexpression of gamma-(cyto) actin on the Acta1(-/-) background restored total actin levels to wild type, resulting in thin filaments composed of 60% gamma-(cyto) actin and a 40% mixture of cardiac and vascular actin, the life span of transgenic Acta1(-/-) mice was not extended. These results indicate that sarcomeric thin filaments can accommodate substantial incorporation of gamma-(cyto) actin without functional consequences, yet gamma-(cyto) actin cannot fully substitute for alpha-(sk) actin."

It has a very low turnover rate, a low affinity for the substrate, CO2, and low specificity between the carboxylation and oxygenation reactions (5Roy H. Andrews T.J. Leegood R.C.

Thus, the intrinsic enzymatic properties of RuBisCO are inadequate for efficient incorporation of CO2 into organic matter in photosynthesis (7Yokota A. Shigeoka S. Bohnert H. Nguyen H. Lewis N.

The phylogenetic tree of the catalytic subunits of RuBisCOs and their homologs shows four major clusters, forms I-III, and form IV (Fig. 1A).

The RLP of B. subtilis is classified in α1 and catalyzes the enolization reaction of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl 1-phosphate (DK-MTP-1-P) but not the carboxylation of RuBP (Fig. 2A) (20Ashida H.

The absence of CO2-fixing activity in the B. subtilis RLP may be ascribed to changes in 8 of the 19 amino acid residues essential for CO2 fixation in RuBisCO (Fig. 1B). Several of these residues are located at the C-terminal domains of B. subtilis RLP and RuBisCO.

B, comparison of active sites between S. oleracea RuBisCO binding CABP (8RUC) and G. kaustophilus RLP (2OEM) modeled to bind DK-MTP-1-P. DK-MTP-1-P in G. kaustophilus RLP was depicted by substituting the methyl group of DK-H-1-P in 2OEM with the thiomethyl group of MTRu-1-P bound to MtnA (28Tamura H. Saito Y. Ashida H. Inoue T. Kai Y.

These five residues of B. subtilis were substituted with other amino acids in this study. CABP and DK-MTP-1-P are shown in white, and their phosphate groups are shown in red and orange, respectively. Mg2+ atoms are shown in yellow. Protein structures were drawn with PyMOL (available on the World Wide Web).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The RuBisCO reaction starts with the abstraction of the C3 proton from RuBP to form the cis-enediol(ate) of RuBP (Fig. 2A) (26Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Using the spinach numbering format to identify RuBisCO and RLP residues, the carbamate formed on the ϵ-amino group of Lys201 may be the general base to abstract the proton, and the cis-enediol(ate) form of RuBP is stabilized in the combination of side chains from Lys175 and His294 (27Taylor T.C. Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Asp203, Glu204, and the carbamate Lys201 of the enzyme active site stabilize the cis-enediol(ate) and CO2 through the Mg2+ ion (26Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis RLP abstracts the C1 proton of its substrate DK-MTP-1-P to start the DK-MTP-1-P enolization reaction (12Tabita F.R. Hanson T.E. Li H. Satagopan S. Singh J. Chan S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 576-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 21Ashida H. Saito Y. Nakano T. Tandeau de Marsac N. Sekowska A. Danchin A. Yokota A. J. Exp.

The ϵ-amino group of Lys123 is thought to be required for the abstraction of the 1-proS proton in the Geobacillus kaustophilus RLP, which belongs to group α1, together with the B. subtilis RLP (Fig. 2B) (25Imker H.J. Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E.V. Almo S.C. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4077-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lys123 is conserved among DK-MTP-1-P enolases and resides very near the C1 of 2,3-diketohexane 1-phosphate (DK-H-1-P), a structural analogue of DK-MTP-1-P. As is the case in RuBisCO, the enolate intermediate is stabilized by Mg2+ and several amino acid residues: Lys175, Asp203, Glu204, His294, and the carbamylated Lys201.The results of these studies suggest that the DK-MTP-1-P enolase is structurally and functionally related to photosynthetic RuBisCO. However, research on the G. kaustophilus RLP revealed that the proton-abstracting, reaction-starting residues differed between the DK-MTP-1-P enolase and RuBisCO (25Imker H.J. Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E.V. Almo S.C. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4077-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been reported that when lysine at 201 is substituted with an alanine in the G. kaustophilus RLP, the enzyme is still capable of catalyzing enolization of DK-MTP-1-P (25Imker H.J. Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E.V. Almo S.C. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4077-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This result raises a question about the above hypothesis on the close evolutionary relationship between the RLP and RuBisCO, because a carbamylated lysine residue would be required at this position to form the Mg2+-chelating triad linkage together with Asp203 and Glu204 and to stabilize the reaction intermediate in the RuBP enolization reaction of RuBisCO.Evolutionary relationships of genes with similar sequences are deduced by comparing gene sequence homology of the genes and amino acid sequence homology of the predicted proteins and by analyzing conservation of functional motifs of the predicted proteins in silico. Comparison of protein structures at the active sites also provides important information. However, it may difficult to predict their mutual evolutionary relationship more precisely when they catalyze different reactions in individual metabolic pathways. The present research adopted a new method to resolve such an issue.We studied the structural and functional interrelationships of RLP and RuBisCO after enzymological characterization of B. subtilis RLP as the DK-MTP-1-P enolase enzyme. The results showed that DK-MTP-1-P enolase activity was limited to some RLPs in the cluster, including B. subtilis in form IV RLPs. All of the catalytic residues for the RuBisCO reaction were also indispensable for DK-MTP-1-P enolase activity. The architecture of the B. subtilis RLP substrate-binding residues stereospecifically stabilized the transition state analog in CO2 fixation of RuBisCO. The fact that the transition state analog of RuBisCO interacts with the active site of Bacillus RLP strongly supports their evolutionary proximity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Xylulose 1,5-bisphosphate (XuBP) was synthesized from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycol aldehyde phosphate by the method of Yokota (29Yokota A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 755-762Google Scholar). The product was separated on a Super-Q Toyopearl column (Tosoh) and eluted with a linear gradient of LiCl. XuBP fractions were pooled. The concentration of XuBP was measured as reported elsewhere (29Yokota A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 755-762Google Scholar).The racemic mixture of 2-carboxy-d-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CABP) and 2-carboxy-d-ribitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CRBP) was synthesized by the method of Pierce et al. (30Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Enantiomers were separated from each other by ionic chromatography on a MonoQ 5/50 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 0-0.4 m linear gradient of LiCl in 3 mm HCl. Fractions with peaks in UV absorbance at 215 nm were assayed for total phosphate (31Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3006) Google Scholar). The phosphorous peak fractions were separately pooled, and Li+ was replaced with Na+ using a Dowex 50 column (Na+ form). Concentrations of CABP and CRBP were calculated from their phosphate content. Other chemicals were analytical grade and were obtained from commercial sources.Preparation of Recombinant RLPs—R. rubrum (National Institute of Technology and Evaluation Biological Resource Center number 3986) was purchased from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (Tsukuba, Japan). R. rubrum was cultured in 702 medium (pH 7.0) containing 10 g/liter polypeptone, 2 g/liter yeast extract, and 1 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O at 30 °C. Genomic DNA of R. rubrum was extracted with a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA from Chlorobium tepidum was kindly provided by Professor Hirozo Oh-oka (Osaka University). The gene for the Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 RLP was obtained from Dr. N. Tandeau de Marsac (Pasteur Institute) (24Carré-Mlouka A. Méjean A. Quillardet P. Ashida H. Saito Y. Yokota A.

Restriction sites for NdeI and BamHI are underlined. The gene for the B. subtilis RLP was cloned into pDG148 plasmid (32Stragier P. Bonamy C. Karmazyn-Campelli C. Cell. 1988; 52: 697-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) using an upstream primer introducing a SalI site (underlined), ACGCGTCGACACGCGATTGCAGTTTGAAGAG, and a downstream primer introducing an SphI site (underlined), ACATGCATGCAGGTTTTCGAGTCGTCATACG.Genes for RLPs of Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 rlp2 (IV-2 in Fig. 1) and Bordetella bronchiseptica RB50 were purchased from GenScript Corp. These genes were synthesized so that codon usage was optimized for Escherichia coli and were flanked by NdeI and BamHI sites. The DNA sequences for RLPs were cloned into pET15b vectors (Novagen, Tokyo, Japan). The pET15b-RLP genes were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The gene for the B. subtilis RLP was mutagenized in a site-directed manner to give K123N, K123I, K123E, K175I, K175E, K201I, and K201E using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Paris, France). The mutagenic primer sets used for PCR mutagenesis are listed in Table S1. The thermocycling program was as follows: denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, followed by 18 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 60 °C for 50 s and elongation at 68 °C for 14 min, and termination with an additional elongation for 7 min.Other mutations, K123A, K175A, K201A, D203N, D203E, E204Q, and E204D, were introduced using mutagenic primer sets (Table S1) with the following thermocycling program: 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 74 °C for 30 min. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. The mutated B. subtilis RLP genes were also transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) with pET15b.Expression and Purification of Recombinant RLPs and Mutated Proteins—Recombinant RLPs and mutated proteins were expressed and purified as reported previously (33Saito Y.

Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).E. coli BL21 (DE3) was used for expression of recombinant RLPs and mutated B. subtilis RLPs. Histidine-tagged RLPs were purified with His-Bind resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After purification, the RLP fraction was passed through a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, and the protein fractions were collected. The His6 tag was excised with 2.6 μg of thrombin/mg of recombinant protein for 3 h at 22 °C. Recombinant RLPs and mutated B. subtilis RLPs were further purified on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The active fractions were pooled and stored at -80 °C until use. Native PAGE and SDS-PAGE were carried out as reported previously (35Chrambach A. Rodbard D.

Tamura H. Matsumura H. Kai Y. Yokota A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding 1.3 μg of methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase to a mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MTRu-1-P, and 0.9 μg of DK-MTP-1-P enolase. The final reaction volume was 100 μl and the reaction temperature was 35 °C unless otherwise stated. The concentration of the reaction substrate, DK-MTP-1-P, was calculated on the basis of the reaction characteristics between 2,3-butanedione and o-phenylenediamine (37Morita N. Inoue K. Takagi M.

Within this time, the consumption of substrate, estimated based on the amount of the product, was less than 10%.Changing of the CO2 concentration in the reaction mixture, where specified, was done by removal of dissolved inorganic carbon, as reported by Matsuda and Colman (39Matsuda Y. Colman B. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A mixture of DK-MTP-1-P enolase (0.1 mg/ml) and methylthioribulose dehydratase (2 mg/ml) was added to a column (0.7 × 26 cm) of Sephadex G-25 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2) containing 1 mm MgCl2, which had previously been equilibrated with N2 (N2 > 99.99%) (Iwatani) for 30 min at 100 °C. The exact concentration of CO2 in the reaction mixture after adding CO2-free MTRu-1-P was calculated from the concentration of the dissolved inorganic carbon that was measured with a CO2 analyzer (LI-6252; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) (40Yokota A.

LPS can be conceptually divided into three parts: lipid A, which anchors LPS into the membrane; core oligosaccharide, which contributes to membrane stability; and the O-antigen, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface. In P. aeruginosa, two types of O-antigen are observed: A-band O-antigen, which is common to most strains, and B-band O-antigen, which is variable and therefore used as the basis of the International Antigenic Typing Scheme (1Liu P.V. Wang S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 922-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa serotypes O2, O5, O16, O18, and O20 collectively belong to serogroup O2, because they all share common backbone sugar structures in their O-antigen repeat units consisting of two di-N-acetylated uronic acids and one 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (N-acetyl-d-fucosamine). The minor structural variations in the O-antigen repeat units that differentiate this serogroup into five serotypes are: the type of glycosidic linkage between O-units (alpha versus beta) that is formed by the O-antigen polymerase (Wzy), isomers present (d-mannuronic or l-guluronic acid), and acetyl group substituents (2Knirel Y.A.

Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 59: 1325-1382Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the two mannuronic acid derivatives has yet to be fully understood and has been the subject of investigation by our group. To produce UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA, a five-step pathway has been proposed (Fig. 1) that requires the products of five genes localized to the B-band O-antigen biosynthesis cluster (5Raymond C.K. Sims E.H. Kas A. Spencer D.H. Kutyavin T.V. Ivey R.G. Zhou Y. Kaul R. Clendenning J.B. Olson M.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3614-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The O-antigen biosynthesis cluster was shown to be identical for all serotypes within serogroup O2, which further underscores the high similarity between these serotypes (5Raymond C.K. Sims E.H.

The five genes, including wbpA, wbpB, wbpE, wbpD, and wbpI, have been shown to be essential for B-band LPS biosynthesis, because knockout mutants of each of these genes are deficient in B-band O-antigen (6Burrows L.L.

Homologs of all five of the proteins required for the UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA biosynthesis pathway are conserved in other bacterial pathogens, including Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Cross-complementation of P. aeruginosa knockout mutants lacking wbpA, wbpB, wbpE, wbpD, or wbpI with the homologues from B. pertussis could fully restore LPS production in the P. aeruginosa LPS mutants, suggesting that the genes from B. pertussis are functional homologs of the wbp genes (7Westman E.L. Preston A. Field R.A. Lam J.S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6060-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Homologs of these genes could be identified in diverse bacterial species, demonstrating the importance of UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA biosynthesis beyond its role in P. aeruginosa (7Westman E.L. Preston A.

The first enzyme of the UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA biosynthesis pathway, WbpA, is a 6-dehydrogenase that converts UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose (N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; UDP-d-GlcNAc) to UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucuronic acid (N-acetyl-d-glucosaminuronic acid, UDP-d-GlcNAcA) using NAD+ as a coenzyme (9Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Larocque S. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Following this, the second step in UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA biosynthesis is proposed to be an oxidation reaction catalyzed by WbpB, forming UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-ribo-hex-3-uluronic acid (3-keto-d-GlcNAcA), which in turn is used as the substrate for transamination by WbpE, creating UDP-2-acetamido-3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucuronic acid (d-GlcNAc3NA). This residue is thought to be the substrate for WbpD, a putative N-acetyltransferase of the hexapeptide acyltransferase superfamily (10Vuorio R. Hirvas L. Vaara M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that requires acetyl-CoA as a co-substrate (8Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Keates R.A. Brewer D. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). WbpD has been proposed to synthesize UDP-2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-d-GlcNAc-3NAcA), which is utilized in the B-band O-antigen of P. aeruginosa serotype O1. In P. aeruginosa serogroup O2, the UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA is then epimerized by WbpI to create the UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA required for incorporation into B-band LPS (11Westman E.L. McNally D.J. Rejzek M. Miller W.L. Kannathasan V.S. Preston A. Maskell D.J. Field R.A. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A derivative of UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA is also used in the synthesis of B-band O-antigen of P. aeruginosa serogroup O2. UDP-d-ManNAc3NAmA is thought to be produced through additional modification of UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA via the action of WbpG, an amidotransferase, which has also been demonstrated to be essential for the production of B-band O-antigen (12Burrows L.L. Charter D.F. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Rocchetta H.L. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 523-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, our aim was to define the function of WbpB, WbpE, and WbpD, because only genetic evidence has previously been given for the involvement of wbpB and wbpE (7Westman E.L. Preston A. Field R.A. Lam J.S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6060-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the reaction catalyzed by WbpD could not be demonstrated due to the unavailability of its presumed substrate, UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA (8Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Keates R.A. Brewer D. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The functional characterization of these proteins is also important for understanding LPS biosynthesis in B. pertussis, because the genes in the LPS locus of this species, wlbA, wlbC, and wlbB, could cross-complement knockouts of wbpB, wbpE, and wbpD, respectively, when expressed in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (7Westman E.L. Preston A. Field R.A. Lam J.S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6060-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these three proteins form a cassette for the generation of C-3 N-acetylated hexoses and may be important for the biosynthesis of a variety of other sugars. Capillary electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used to analyze reaction mixtures of WbpB and WbpE and showed that the expected products were produced only when both enzymes were present together. Achieving the enzymatic synthesis of the product of both enzymes, which was demonstrated to be UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA by 1H NMR spectroscopy, was a key breakthrough, because this rare sugar has never before been produced by any means. UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA was also essential for use as the substrate of WbpD, which not only allowed us to determine the enzymatic activity of this protein but also allowed the enzymatic synthesis of UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA to be achieved as well. Although this sugar had previously been produced through a 17-step chemical synthesis (11Westman E.L. McNally D.J. Rejzek M. Miller W.L. Kannathasan V.S. Preston A. Maskell D.J. Field R.A. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Rejzek M. Kannathasan V.S. Wing C. Preston A. Westman E.L. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. Maskell D.J. Field R.A. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2009; 7: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the 4-step concurrent enzymatic reaction demonstrates the advantage of linking chemistry with biology and represents a significant saving of both time and reagents as compared with chemical synthesis. Finally, our data also showed the success in reconstituting in vitro the 5-step pathway for the biosynthesis of UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA in P. aeruginosa. Overexpression and Purification of Wbp* Enzymes—All strains and plasmids used have been documented (Table 1). pET-His6-WbpB was expressed in Escherichia coli Tuner(DE3) induced with 0.01 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 15 °C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, and 20% glycerol). After ultrasonication (Sonic Dismembrator model 500, Fisher Scientific), the soluble fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 × g for 1 h (Beckman L8–55M ultracentrifuge) and then bound to 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The column was washed with buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, and then eluted with buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. A PD-10 column was used to exchange the protein into storage buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 25% glycerol).TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidDescriptionReferenceStrainP. aeruginosaPAO1Serotype O5, type strain(27Hancock R.E.

All purified enzymes were stored at –20 °C, and quantified using spectrophotometric assay (A280 = ϵCl) using ϵ values calculated from ProtParam (16Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). Analytical Enzyme Reactions—UDP-d-GlcNAcA was synthesized from commercial UDP-d-GlcNAc using purified His6-WbpA as previously described (17Miller W.L. Matewish M.J. McNally D.J. Ishiyama N. Anderson E.M. Brewer D. Brisson J.R. Berghuis A.M. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3507-3518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). His6-WbpB reactions contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm NAD+, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm UDP-d-GlcNAcA. Reactions with His6-WbpE also contained 5 mm pyridoxal phosphate and 5 mm l-glutamate. Reactions with His6-WbpD contained additional 1 mm acetyl-CoA. All reactions used 0.05 mg/ml of each enzyme desired, were allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C, and were frozen at –20 °C until capillary electrophoresis analysis. WbpI reactions were carried out as previously described (11Westman E.L. McNally D.J. Rejzek M. Miller W.L. Kannathasan V.S. Preston A. Maskell D.J. Field R.A. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Capillary Electrophoresis—Capillary electrophoresis was performed using a P/ACE MDQ glycoprotein system (Beckman Coulter) with UV detection at 254 nm. The capillary was bare silica 75 μm × 50 cm with a detector at 40 cm and was conditioned before each run by washing with 1 m sodium hydroxide for 2 min, and then running buffer (25 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.5) for 2 min. Samples were introduced by pressure injection for 16 s, and separation was performed at 22 kV. Mass Spectrometry—Enzymes were removed from the reactions using Microcon YM-10 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore), but no other purification was performed. Filtered samples (2 μl) were mixed directly with matrix solution (2 mg of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 20% of ethanol) in an analyte: matrix 1:2 ratio (v/v), and 1 μl was spotted on the MALDI sample target and allowed to dry at room temperature. In some cases sample spots were covered by an additional 1-μl matrix solution. Analysis was performed using a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF MS instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser. Samples were analyzed in reflectron and negative ion modes scanning from 0 to 1000 m/z and using ion suppression up to 150 m/z. For all experiments, the ion sources 1 and 2 were held at 20 kV and 16.35 kV, respectively, and guiding lens voltage at 9.75 kV. The nitrogen laser power was set to 66–90 μJ. Two-point external calibration was performed, using the [M – H]– (223.06 Da) and [2M – H]– (447.12 Da) peaks of sinapinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in acetonitrile/water solution (1 mg of sinapinic acid in 100 μl of 1:1 H2O/CH3CN). The mass accuracy with external calibration using sinapinic acid is estimated to be better than 5 ppm. Enzymatic Synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc3NA and UDP-GlcNAc3NAcA—For UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA, a 5-ml reaction contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 2.5 mm NAD+, 5 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 5 mm l-glutamate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm UDP-d-GlcNAc, and 0.05 mg/ml each of His6-WbpA, His6-WbpB, and His6-WbpE. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the reaction was filtered using VivaSpin 15R columns (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Germany). The filtrate was diluted to 100 ml before anion-exchange chromatography using an Econo-Pac High-Q 5-ml cartridge and a gradient of 0–500 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Samples from peaks were lyophilized and screened by CE. Fractions containing putative UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA were pooled and lyophilized, and then stored at –20 °C until NMR analysis. For UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA, the same strategy was used except that 1 mm acetyl-CoA and 0.05 mg/ml of His6-WbpD were included in the 5-ml reaction mixture. The concentration for sugar pools was calculated by spectrophotometric assay (A262 = ϵCl) using ϵ = 10.1 mm–1cm–1. The chemical synthesis of UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA will be reported elsewhere. NMR Spectroscopy—Lyophilized sugar samples were resuspended in 200 μl of D2O (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories) and examined using a Varian Unity 500-MHz (1H) spectrometer (Palo Alto California) with a Varian Z-gradient 3-mm 15N, 31P probe. Standard homo- and heteronuclear correlated two-dimensional 1H NMR (COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY) and 13C HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) pulse sequences from Varian were used for general assignments. Selective one-dimensional TOCSY experiments with a Z-filter were used for complete residue assignments and measurement of proton coupling constants (JH,H) and nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs). NMR experiments were performed with suppression of the HOD resonance at δH 4.78 ppm, and the methyl resonance of acetone was used as an internal reference (δH, 2.225 ppm; δC, 31.07 ppm). In Silico Analysis of WbpB and WbpE—The Pseudomonas Genome Database V2 shows that WbpB contains PFAM domains common to the oxidoreductase family and predicts an NAD-binding Rossmann fold at the N terminus of the protein, while COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) predicted similarity to MviM, putative dehydrogenases, and related proteins. WbpE was predicted to have similarity to WecE, a putative pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme apparently involved in regulation of cell wall biogenesis. TIGRFAM identified the same WecE domain. WecE is a TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose transaminase. The top-scoring PFAM was the DegT/DnrJ/EryC1/StrS aminotransferase family, but several other aminotransferase families were also identified as hits. Purification of UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA Pathway Enzymes—WbpA, WbpB, WbpE, WbpD, and WbpI were individually purified to near homogeneity and had apparent molecular masses consistent with their expected structures (Fig. 2). Initial trials with His6-WbpB indicated that the protein was expressed mainly as inclusion bodies. This problem was alleviated when the protein was expressed in Tuner(DE3) cells with very low concentration isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and an adequate yield of soluble protein was obtained. His6-WbpB also frequently precipitates. To alleviate this problem, the purification was conducted in the presence of 20% glycerol and 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. Typical yields of ∼0.7 mg of His6-WbpB were obtained from a 250-ml culture after exchange into storage buffer. Expression of His6-WbpE is extremely poor with most standard protein expression conditions used except with the use of Rosetta(DE3) cells and an overnight 15 °C induction to improve soluble yield. Under optimal conditions, ∼2.8 mg of His6-WbpE per 250-ml culture was obtained. An FPLC-based purification method used for His6-WbpD yielded ∼1.4 mg of protein from 250 ml of culture. When stored at –20 °C, the proteins were stable for at least 3 weeks, while precipitation occurred if the protein was left at ambient temperature or subjected to excessive freeze/thaw cycles. Purification of the previously characterized proteins His6-WbpA and His6-WbpI proceeded according to expectations (9Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Larocque S. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Westman E.L. McNally D.J. Rejzek M. Miller W.L. Kannathasan V.S. Preston A. Maskell D.J. Field R.A. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Capillary Electrophoresis Analysis of Enzyme Catalyzed Reactions—Many attempts to visualize a reaction product from His6-WbpB reactions under various conditions all failed, because no novel product peaks were observed when compared with no-enzyme controls. However, one new peak was observed, and it was identified as NADH based on spiking the reaction with additional NADH (Fig. 3). In the reaction between His6-WbpE and UDP-d-GlcNAcA, neither a new product peak nor cofactor turnover could be discerned (Fig. 3). However, when His6-WbpB and His6-WbpE were added together to a reaction mixture, two peaks were identified: NADH and a novel peak migrating just ahead of the UDP-d-GlcNAcA substrate (Fig. 3). This novel peak is thought to be UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA, which is the predicted substrate for WbpD. His6-WbpD reactions were attempted in conjunction with both His6-WbpB and His6-WbpE reactions to produce the putative substrate in situ. Reactions with His6-WbpB, His6-WbpE, and His6-WbpD also contained acetyl-CoA, because it is a required cofactor for His6-WbpD. When analyzed by CE, these reactions showed the presence of several new peaks and an absence of the putative UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA peak that was observed in the WbpB- and WbpE-coupled reactions (Fig. 3). Control reactions with UDP-d-GlcNAcA, acetyl-CoA, and His6-WbpD alone produced CE traces that were identical to those from the reactions with WbpB, WbpE, and WbpD (data not shown). Large scale reactions with His6-WbpA, His6-WbpB, and His6-WbpE, or His6-WbpA, His6-WbpB, His6-WbpE, and His6-WbpD, were screened by CE before NMR analysis. Analysis of the complete WbpA/WbpB/WbpE reaction mixture showed the same putative UDP-d-GlcNAc3NA peak migrating just before the UDP-d-GlcNAcA substrate peak. After separation by anion-exchange chromatography, selected aliquots were lyophilized, and small samples of these were analyzed by CE before and after the addition of UDP-d-GlcNAcA to the sample. The samples were shown to contain two peaks, one that co-migrated with UDP-d-GlcNAcA and one that migrated just ahead of the added UDP-d-GlcNAcA; these aliquots were pooled and subjected to NMR analysis. In the case of the unseparated WbpA/WbpB/WbpE/WbpD reaction, no putative product peak could be discerned due to poor signal-to-noise ratio created by the confounding acetyl-CoA peaks. After anion-exchange separation, selected aliquots were lyophilized, and samples of each were tested with and without the addition of chemically synthesized UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA. Aliquots represented by samples that co-migrated with the known UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA were pooled and further analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Reactions with His6-WbpI using the enzymatically synthesized UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA showed the production of a novel peak; this peak was absent in control reactions without enzymes. Comparison to a His6-WbpI reaction using chemically synthesized UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA as a standard indicated that the novel peak co-migrates with UDP-d-ManNAc3NAcA (data not shown). MS Analysis of WbpB, WbpE, and WbpD Reactions—Mass spectrometry was used to analyze the same reaction mixes screened by CE. Reactions containing only His6-WbpB or His6-WbpE, respectively, showed the presence of an ion at 620.01 m/z or 620.03 m/z (data not shown), like that of the no-enzyme control (620.02 m/z, Fig. 4a). In contrast, the reaction containing both His6-WbpB and His6-WbpE demonstrated the presence of three different ions: 620.09, 618.07, and 619.10 m/z (Fig. 4b). Reactions with His6-WbpB, His6-WbpE, and His6-WbpD contained ions 620.17 m/z and 619.24 m/z, as well as a new ion at 661.20 m/z (Fig. 4c). The ion at 661.20 m/z was absent in control reactions that lacked His6-WbpD, because only 620.13 m/z and 619.14 m/z were observed (data not shown). A positive control consisting of chemically synthesized UDP-d-GlcNAc3NAcA resuspended in reaction buffer without enzymes contained a peak at 661.1 m/z (Fig. 4). NMR Spectroscopy of Enzymatically Synthesized Putative UDP-α-d-GlcNAc3NA (I) and UDP-α-d-GlcNAc3NAcA (II)—The purified product of the coupled WbpB-WbpE reaction (I) was lyophilized, resuspended in 175 μl of D2O, and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 5). The proton NMR spectrum revealed one major anomeric signal for I resonating at δH 5.52 ppm (Fig. 5a and Table 2). Selective one-dimensional TOCSY of H1 (90 ms) was used to identify resonances for H2, H3, H4, and H5, as well as to measure coupling constants (Fig. 5b). Large J2,3 (11.1 Hz), J3,4 (10.2 Hz), and J4,5 (10.0 Hz) couplings indicated a gluco ring configuration, which was corroborated by strong H2–H4 and H3–H5 NOEs observed using a two-dimensional NOESY experiment (800 ms, not shown). Using a 1H-13C HSQC experiment, C3 was determined to be N-substituted based on its upfield resonance at δC 53.1 ppm (Fig. 5c). In contrast, C3 in UDP-α-d-GlcNAcA was reported to resonate at δC 71.5 ppm (11Westman E.L. McNally D.J. Rejzek M. Miller W.L. Kannathasan V.S. Preston A. Maskell D.J. Field R.A. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S.

Based on the findings of mass spectrometric analyses as well as these NMR results, the product of the WbpB-WbpE reaction was concluded to be UDP-α-d-GlcNAc3NA (I). Based on the results of proton, COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and 1H-13C HSQC experiments, the purified reaction product of the WbpD reaction (II) was determined to be UDP-α-d-GlcNAc3NAcA (Table 2). The identity of II was supported by data of proton and carbon chemical shifts as well as coupling constants that were nearly identical to those reported for UDP-α-d"
https://openalex.org/W2034092309,"TyrA proteins belong to a family of dehydrogenases that are dedicated to l-tyrosine biosynthesis. The three TyrA subclasses are distinguished by their substrate specificities, namely the prephenate dehydrogenases, the arogenate dehydrogenases, and the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenases, which utilize prephenate, l-arogenate, or both substrates, respectively. The molecular mechanism responsible for TyrA substrate selectivity and regulation is unknown. To further our understanding of TyrA-catalyzed reactions, we have determined the crystal structures of Aquifex aeolicus prephenate dehydrogenase bound with NAD+ plus either 4-hydroxyphenylpyuvate, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate, or l-tyrosine and have used these structures as guides to target active site residues for site-directed mutagenesis. From a combination of mutational and structural analyses, we have demonstrated that His-147 and Arg-250 are key catalytic and binding groups, respectively, and Ser-126 participates in both catalysis and substrate binding through the ligand 4-hydroxyl group. The crystal structure revealed that tyrosine, a known inhibitor, binds directly to the active site of the enzyme and not to an allosteric site. The most interesting finding though, is that mutating His-217 relieved the inhibitory effect of tyrosine on A. aeolicus prephenate dehydrogenase.

The identification of a tyrosine-insensitive mutant provides a novel avenue for designing an unregulated enzyme for application in metabolic engineering. Tyrosine serves as a precursor for the synthesis of proteins and secondary metabolites such as quinones (1Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol.

In prokaryotes and plants, these compounds are important for viability and normal development (7Taylor L.P. Grotewold E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).The TyrA protein family consists of dehydrogenase homologues that are dedicated to the biosynthesis of l-tyrosine. These enzymes participate in two independent metabolic branches that result in the conversion of prephenate to l-tyrosine, namely the arogenate route and the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) 3The abbreviations used are: HPP, 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate; PD, prephenate dehydrogenase; AD, arogenate dehydrogenase; HPpropionate, hydroxyphenylpropionate; CM-PD, chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase. 3The abbreviations used are: HPP, 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate; PD, prephenate dehydrogenase; AD, arogenate dehydrogenase; HPpropionate, hydroxyphenylpropionate; CM-PD, chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase. routes. Although both of these pathways utilize a common precursor and converge to produce a common end-product, they differ in the sequential order of enzymatic steps. Through the HPP route, prephenate is first decarboxylated by prephenate dehydrogenase (PD) to yield HPP, which is subsequently transaminated to l-tyrosine via a TyrB homologue (8Fazel A.M. Bowen J.R. Jensen R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1270-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Alternatively, through the arogenate route, prephenate is first transaminated to l-arogenate by prephenate aminotransferase and then decarboxylated by arogenate dehydrogenase (AD) to yield l-tyrosine (9Bonner C. Jensen R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Bonner C. Jensen R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Fazel A.M. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 805-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A).There are three classes of TyrA enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation reactions in these two pathways. The enzymes are distinguished by the affinity for cyclohexadienyl substrates. PD and AD accept prephenate or l-arogenate, respectively, whereas the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenases can catalyze the reaction using either substrate (12Song J. Bonner C.A. Wolinsky M. Jensen R.A. BMC Biol. 2005; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).To ensure efficient metabolite distribution of the pathway intermediates, TyrA enzymes are highly regulated by various control mechanisms, including feedback inhibition, and genetic regulation by the Tyr operon (13Bonner C.A.

In some cases, l-tyrosine competes directly with substrate, be it prephenate or l-arogenate for the active site of arogenate or cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenases (14Bonner C.A. Jensen R.A. Gander J.E. Keyhani N.O. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Rippert P. Matringe M. Eur. J.

Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1417-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The product HPP can also serve as an efficient competitive inhibitor with respect to prephenate (20Jensen R.A. Stenmark S.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1975; 4: 249-259Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, at the protein level PDs are only shown to be regulated at distinct allosteric sites or domains to modulate their activity. For example, the results of kinetic studies on the bifunctional Escherichia coli chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase (CM-PD) have indicated that this enzyme likely possesses a distinct allosteric site for binding tyrosine (21Turnbull J. Morrison J.F. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7783-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Bacillus subtilis PD is the only enzyme reported to be competitively inhibited by HPP and l-tyrosine but is also noncompetitively inhibited by l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan (12Song J. Bonner C.A. Wolinsky M. Jensen R.A. BMC Biol. 2005; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Champney W.S. Jensen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3763-3770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional regulatory control is thought to originate through a C-terminal aspartate kinase-CM-TyrA domain of the B. subtilis PD (23Chipman D.M. Shaanan B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Biochemical analyses of PD from E. coli CM-PD have provided a framework for understanding the molecular mechanism of the TyrA enzymes. The E. coli PD-catalyzed reaction proceeds though a rapid equilibrium, random kinetic mechanism with catalysis as the rate-limiting step (24Sampathkumar P. Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 702: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies of the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters V and V/K indicate that a deprotonated group facilitates hydride transfer from prephenate to NAD+ by polarizing the 4-hydroxyl group of prephenate, whereas a protonated residue is required for binding prephenate to the enzyme·NAD+ complex (25Turnbull J. Cleland W.W. Morrison J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7777-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The conserved residues His-197 and Arg-294 have been identified through extensive mutagenesis studies to fulfill these two roles (26Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Christendat D. Saridakis V.C. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15703-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further analyses of the activities of wild-type protein and site-directed variants in the presence of a series of inhibitory substrate analogues support the idea that Arg-294 binds prephenate through the ring carboxylate (26Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The structures of AD from Synechocystis sp. and PD from Aquifex aeolicus (both in complex with NAD+) have been reported by Legrand et al. (28Legrand P. Dumas R. Seux M. Rippert P. Ravelli R. Ferrer J.L. Matringe M. Structure. 2006; 14: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by our group (29Sun W. Singh S. Zhang R. Turnbull J.L. Christendat D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12919-12928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), respectively. Analyses of these structures have provided structural information on the conserved histidine and arginine residues. The structure A. aeolicus PD has also led to the identification of other active site residues that may play a role in enzyme catalysis, most notably Ser-126, which we propose facilitates catalysis by orienting the catalytic histidine and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ into their catalytically efficient conformations. Ambiguities can arise from examination of the binary complexes, because prephenate has only been modeled in the active site. For example, analysis of the AD structure by Legrand et al. (28Legrand P. Dumas R. Seux M. Rippert P. Ravelli R. Ferrer J.L. Matringe M. Structure. 2006; 14: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) places Arg-217 (equivalent to Arg-294 in E. coli and Arg-250 in A. aeolicus) too far from the active site to play a role in prephenate binding. Thus, the full complement of interactions between prephenate and TyrA proteins are still largely unknown, as are the interactions of the enzymes with l-tyrosine.To further investigate the importance of residues involved in ligand binding, specificity, and catalysis, we have carried out co-crystallization studies of A. aeolicus PD with NAD+ and prephenate, with NAD+ and 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate (HPpropionate), a product analogue, and with NAD+ and l-tyrosine. Accordingly, this study provides the first direct evidence that l-tyrosine binds to the active site of a prephenate dehydrogenase. We have investigated the role of Ser-126, His-147, His-217, and Arg-250 through the kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants and structural analysis of the co-crystal complexes. To understand the role of active site residues in substrate selectivity, comparative structural analysis of AD and PD was also conducted. The current study provides a basis for understanding the mechanism of substrate selectivity between the different classes of TyrA enzymes and details how A. aeolicus PD can accept prephenate as substrate and l-tyrosine as a competitive inhibitor.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Reagents—Prephenate was prepared as described previously (30Duzinski P.K. Morrison J.F. Prep. Biochem. 1976; 6: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar), while NAD+ (free acid) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. l-Tyrosine was from ICN, whereas HPP and HPpropionate were from Aldrich. The keto form of HPP was prepared as outlined in Lindblad et al. (31Lindblad B. Lindstedt G. Lindstedt S. Rundgren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5073-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were of molecular biology grade and were purchased from Sigma, Bioshop, or BDH. Oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The expression plasmid (Δ19PD) encoding residues 20-311 of the A. aeolicus VF5 PD protein (AAC07589 from Genbank™) has been previously described (19Bonvin J. Aponte R.A. Marcantonio M. Singh S. Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1417-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), whereby complimentary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations for Δ19PD were used. Table 1 summarizes the mutants generated and the respective oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis. All Δ19PD mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Forward primers used to generate active site variantsVariantForward primer (5′ → 3′)S126AGGATCAGGGAGCGGTTAAGGGGAH147NGTTGGAGGGAACCCGATAGCAGGAACGGAGH217AaAlso contains the silent restriction site (CCGCGG) for Cfr421 to assist in screening mutant DNA.GTTTCTCACCTTCCCGCCGCGGTTGCGTTTGCACTCGH217NGTTTCTCACCTTCCCAACGCGGTTGCGTTTGCACTCR250QGTTTTAAGGACTTCACGCAGATTGCAAAGAGCGACCa Also contains the silent restriction site (CCGCGG) for Cfr421 to assist in screening mutant DNA. Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—All constructs of A. aeolicus VF5 PD were expressed and purified as previously described (29Sun W. Singh S. Zhang R. Turnbull J.L. Christendat D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12919-12928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells harboring recombinant mutant Δ19PD were disrupted by French press followed by sonication, and the heat treatment step was omitted. Following chromatography of the thrombin-treated enzyme on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, PDs were subjected directly to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column.Determination of Enzyme Activity and Dissociation Constants for Ligand Binding—Enzyme activity of A. aeolicus PD in the presence of NAD+ and prephenate was monitored in a 1-ml reaction cuvette containing 50 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 as previously described (19Bonvin J. Aponte R.A. Marcantonio M. Singh S. Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1417-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 2 min, and then the reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The production of NADH was followed at 340 nm spectrophotometrically. The turnover numbers and Michaelis constants for substrates were obtained by fitting initial velocity to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Inhibition constants (Ki) for the dissociation of HPP, HPpropionate, or l-tyrosine from the enzyme·NAD+ complex were obtained by fitting initial velocity data to the equation for linear competitive inhibition. These data were obtained by varying prephenate at four concentrations ranging from below to above the Km (in the presence of 2 mm NAD+) and HPP from 0.2 to 1.0 mm and l-tyrosine ranging from 0 to 5 mm. Percent residual activity as a function of l-tyrosine concentration was monitored as described by Bonvin et al. (19Bonvin J. Aponte R.A. Marcantonio M. Singh S. Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1417-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All kinetic data were fitted to the appropriate rate equations by using the computer programs of Cleland (32Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar) or GraFit (Version 5.0, Leatherbarrow). Changes in fluorescence emission as a function of prephenate concentration were used to determine dissociation constants of the prephenate from the binary complex as described by Bonvin et al. (19Bonvin J. Aponte R.A. Marcantonio M. Singh S. Christendat D. Turnbull J.L. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1417-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard.Crystallization of PD—The initial crystallization condition was determined with a sparse matrix crystallization (Hampton Research Crystal ScreenI™) screen at room temperature using the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion technique. The optimized co-crystallization condition consists of 48% 2-methyl-1,3 propanediol and 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.8, and co-crystals were obtained by supplementing the protein solution (at a concentration of 12 mg/ml) with 5 mm NAD+ and 10 mm of HPpropionate or prephenate, or 2.25 mm l-tyrosine.X-ray Diffraction and Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data were collected from single crystals at a temperature of 100 K in a nitrogen stream on beamline SBC19 at a wavelength 0.9794 Å at the Argonne National Laboratory, Advanced Photon Source. The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL3000 suite of programs (DENZO/SCALEPACK) (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The enzyme-ligand structures were sufficiently isomorphous with the previously described Δ19PD·NAD+-complexed structure (29Sun W. Singh S. Zhang R. Turnbull J.L. Christendat D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12919-12928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to allow the immediate use of the RIGID routine of CNS (Crystallography and NMR system) (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar), to correctly place the search model. Model visualization and rebuilding were done with the program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar).The remainder of the model was manually built with O, and simulated annealing refinement was subsequently conducted with CNS after every round of model building. In the later stages of model rebuilding and structure refinements, Coot and Refmac with TLS refinement were, respectively, used for the Δ19PD·NADH·HPP, Δ19PD·NAD+-HPpropionate, and Δ19PD·NAD+-l-tyrosine structures, until each of the model converged (36Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar, 37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

All molecules of PD were rebuilt prior to every round of refinement, and non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were not applied during refinement. NAD+ molecules and ligands were fitted to the unaccounted electron density in each molecule in the tetramer after the second round of refinement. PDB, topology, and parameter files for NAD+, tyrosine, HPpropionate, and HPP were obtained from the HIC-up server (41Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42DeLano W. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Representative figures from the crystal structure were produced with PyMOL.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe primary objectives of this study were to identify active site residues that are directly involved in the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of PD and to determine the mechanism that contributes to substrate selectivity among enzymes in the TyrA family. Co-crystallization was conducted in the presence of NAD+ and either prephenate, HPpropionate, or l-tyrosine. Site-directed mutagenesis studies targeted residues Ser-126, His-147, His-217, and Arg-250, which are considered important for either the enzyme-catalyzed reaction or for conferring ligand selectivity.Crystallization and Structural Summaries of Δ19PD·NADH·HPP, Δ19PD·NAD+-HPpropionate, and Δ19PD·NAD+-l-Tyrosine—Crystals of Δ19PD·NAD+-HPP, Δ19PD·NAD+-HPpropionate, and Δ19PD·NAD+-l-tyrosine grew under identical precipitant and pH crystallization conditions. These crystals belong to space group P212121, and their respective structures were determined by molecular replacement. All atomic models display excellent overall stereochemistry as judged by the Ramachandran plot; for the structures of Δ19PD complexed with NADH-HPP, NAD+-HPpropionate, and NAD+-l-tyrosine >99% of the residues are in the allowed regions. The structure of Δ19PD·NADH·HPP, Δ19PD·NAD+-HPpropionate, and Δ19PD·NAD+-l-tyrosine were refined to 2.15, 2.25, and 2.0 Å, respectively.

Poor quality of electron density in these regions of the maps contributed to the higher than normal refinement factors, Rfree and Rwork (Table 3).Crystals of Δ19PD·NAD+-HPpropionate and Δ19PD·NAD+-l-tyrosine were obtained from co-crystallization studies with 5 mm NAD+ and 10 mm of HPpropionate or 2.25 mm l-tyrosine, respectively. Interestingly, the Δ19PD·NADH·HPP crystals were obtained from co-crystallization experiment containing 5 mm NAD+ and 10 mm prephenate. The presence of NADH in the protein crystal was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The presence of HPP and NADH instead of prephenate and NAD+, in the structure, indicates that prephenate was enzymatically converted to HPP during the co-crystallization studies. Fig. 1B shows the chemical structure of each representative ligand used in structure determination of Δ19PD. All ligand types were located in the Fo - Fc difference electron density map after the initial round of refinement. Accordingly, these molecules were built into the model prior to the second round of refinement (Fig. 2, A-C).FIGURE 2Representative (2F - Fc) electron density contoured at 1σ for NAD+, Wat-1 and a bound ligand in the active site of A. aeolicus prephenate dehydrogenase. The active site is characterized by a polar region consisting of residues His-147, Ser-126, His-214, Ser-213, Phe-209, and His-205, a hydrophobic region consisting of residues Ile-149, Ala-150, Gly-151, Thr-152, His-217, Phe-221, Met-258, and Trp-259, and an ionic region consisting of residues Glu-153, Arg-250, Ile-251, and Asp-247′. A, HPP-bound active site; B, HPpropionate-bound active site; and C, tyrosine-bound active site. The electron density for each ligand is unambiguous. Comparison of the active sites shows that most interactions are conserved among the three ligands; in contrast, their conformations are markedly different. The position of the water molecule (WAT1) is also well conserved in all three structures containing HPpropionate, HPP, or tyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Only one molecule of the product or product analogue is consistently identified per dimer. In contrast, both subunits in the dimer contain a molecule of NAD+ or NADH. For example, for each dimer of the ternary complex Δ19PD·NADH·HPP, one subunit contains a molecule of NADH and one molecule of product (we define this as a “paired” occupancy), whereas the other subunit contains only one molecule of NAD+, but no product (we defined this as the “unpaired” occupancy). It is unlikely that interdimer interaction in the crystal packing prevents the binding of HPP to both binding sites simultaneously, because the structure was obtained from co-crystallization studies. The presence of NAD+ in the active site suggests that NAD+ binds first followed by prephenate; similarly, HPP needs to be released before NADH from the active site. This is highly speculative: this model is supported by the fact that we never identified that HPP, in the absence of NADH, occupied the active site. It is also likely that NAD+ binding is required for crystallization. The observation of paired and unpaired occupancy of product analogue in the dimer is indicative that substrate binding and product release are ordered, which is consistent with kinetic data obtained for arogenate dehydrogenase from Synechosystis sp. in which arogenate preferentially binds first (14Bonner C.A. Jensen R.A. Gander J.E. Keyhani N.O. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, this finding contrasts the random kinetic mechanism proposed from the analysis of initial velocity and dead-end and product inhibition studies of PD and AD from a number of organisms, including E. coli and Arabidopsis thaliana (17Rippert P. Matringe M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4753-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Bonvin J. Aponte R.A. Marcantonio M. Singh S. Christendat D. Turnbull J.L.

Structure. 2006; 14: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Conformational Shifting upon Substrate Binding—Superimposition of the crystal structure of PD indicated that substrate binding induces a global conformational change on the dimer. The dimeric protein is in a closed conformation with only NAD+ bound and the binding of HPP or a product analogue moves the two subunits away by about 5 Å (Fig. 3, A and B, inset). This global conformational change is imparted mainly on the unpaired monomer. Therefore, the unpaired monomer is in the “open” conformation (Fig. 3A). We speculated that this global conformational change could negatively influence the binding of ligands, product analogues in this case, to the unpaired monomer. Mainly because the a"

In this study, we examined the roles of GATA-1 and GATA-2 in activating transcription of the secretory ribonuclease, the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/RNase 2). Augmented expression of both GATA-1 and GATA-2 was detected in eosinophil promyelocyte HL-60 clone 15 cells in response to biochemical differentiation with butyric acid. Deletion or mutation of one or both of the two consensus GATA-binding sites in the extended 1000-bp 5′ promoter of the EDN gene resulted in profound reduction in reporter gene activity. Antibody-augmented electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that GATA-1 and GATA-2 proteins bind to both functional GATA consensus sequences in the EDN promoter. Interestingly, RNA silencing of GATA-1 alone had no impact on EDN expression; silencing of GATA-2 resulted in diminished expression of EDN, and also diminished expression of GATA-1 in both butyric acid-induced HL-60 clone 15 cells and in differentiating human eosinophils derived from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. Likewise, overexpression of GATA-2 in uninduced HL-60 clone 15 cells resulted in augmented transcription of both EDN and GATA-1. Taken together, our data suggest that GATA-2 functions directly via interactions with the EDN promoter and also indirectly, via its ability to regulate the expression of GATA-1 in differentiating eosinophils and eosinophil cell lines.

Taken together, our data suggest that GATA-2 functions directly via interactions with the EDN promoter and also indirectly, via its ability to regulate the expression of GATA-1 in differentiating eosinophils and eosinophil cell lines. Eosinophils remain among the most enigmatic of the mammalian leukocytes, although consensus opinion is that they contribute in some fashion to the pathophysiology of allergic asthma and gastrointestinal dysfunction (1Rothenberg M.E. Hogan S.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 147-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Despite disagreement as to their function, eosinophils are clearly identified in peripheral blood and tissues by their unique morphology and staining characteristics, including their characteristic bilobed nuclei and large refractile granules containing distinct, cationic secretory proteins. Eosinophils differentiate from pluripotent stem cells in bone marrow, and they can be induced to develop from CD34 antigen-positive progenitor cells in vitro in response to cytokine stimulation (2Roboz G.J. Rafii S. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whereas no unique events have been identified that define the eosinophil lineage specifically, transcription factors that contribute in various ways to eosinophil development include C/EBPα, C/EBPϵ, PU.1, and GATA-1 and -2, although the precise temporal and kinetic interplay between these factors remains to be elucidated (3Escoubet-Lozach L.

Med. 2002; 195: F43-F47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The recent finding that ablation of a palindromic dblGATA enhancer-binding site in the promoter of the mouse Gata-1 gene results in eosinophil-lineage ablation in vivo (5Yu C. Cantor A.B. Yang H. Browne C. Wells R.A. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) has resulted in a particular focus on the role of GATA transcription factors in promoting eosinophil development and differentiation. GATA-1 was first described as promoting transcription of erythroid genes (reviewed in Refs. 6Ohneda K. Yamamoto M. Acta Haematol. 2002; 108: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7Koury M.J. Sawyer S.T. Brandt S.J. Curr. Opin.

Albee E.A. Kimura A. Bennett J.C. Orkin S.H. Ackerman S.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 3234-3241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate expression of the hematopoietic GATA factors (GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3) in isolated human eosinophils and eosinophilic cell lines. Kulessa et al. (10Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) found that overexpression of GATA-1 converts avian myelomonocytic cell lines into other lineages, including eosinophils, and Hirasawa et al. (11Hirasawa R. Shimizu R. Takahashi S. Osawa M. Takayanagi S. Kato Y. Onodera M. Minegishi N. Yamamoto M. Fukao K. Taniguchi H. Nakauchi H. Iwama A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) discovered the same to be true for human primary myeloid progenitors, with GATA-2 compensating effectively for GATA-1 both in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, Iwasaki et al. (12Iwasaki H. Mizuno S. Arinobu Y. Ozawa H. Mori Y. Shigematsu H. Takatsu K. Tenen D.G. Akashi K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3010-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) reported that GATA-2 overexpression in C/EBPα-expressing granulocyte/monocyte progenitor cultures likewise resulted in eosinophil commitment and differentiation. At the molecular level, functional GATA-1 enhancer sites direct the expression of the eosinophil granule major basic protein (13Yamaguchi Y. Nishio H. Kishi K. Ackerman S.J. Suda T. Blood. 1999; 94: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GATA-1 directs the eosinophil-specific expression of gp91phox, with GATA-2 functioning as a site-specific repressor (14Yang D. Suzuki S.

Here we examine the role of GATA transcription factors in directing the expression of the human eosinophil secretory ribonuclease, the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/RNase 2). EDN 2The abbreviations used are: EDN, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin; RNase, ribonuclease; siRNA, silencing RNA; HEPPSO, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BA, butyric acid; IL, interleukin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. is a rapidly evolving RNase A ribonuclease with several intriguing biological activities (reviewed in Ref. 15Rosenberg H.F. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2008; 9: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). EDN was first identified as a neurotoxin (16Durack D.T. Ackerman S.J. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Proc. Natl.

Immunol. 1982; 70: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), as microgram quantities of this protein injected intrathecally into experimental animals resulted in Purkinje cell loss and concomitant ataxia. EDN also has antiviral properties (reviewed in Ref. 18Rosenberg H.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 83: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and recent studies suggest that EDN interacts with dendritic cells via signaling through the toll-like receptor TLR2 (19Yang D. Chen Q. Su S.B. Zhang P. Kurosaka K. Caspi R.R. Michalek S.M. Rosenberg H.F. Zhang N. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In an initial study utilizing minimal functional promoters, we determined that full transcriptional activity of EDN required the presence of one or more intron-based enhancer elements (20Tiffany H.L. Handen J.S. Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12387-12393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Handen J.S. Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol.

(24Wang H.Y. Chang H.T. Pai T.W. Wu C.I. Lee Y.H. Chang Y.H. Tai H.L. Tang C.Y. Chou W.Y. Chang M.D. BMC Mol.

In this study, we focus on the extended 1000-bp 5′ promoter of EDN and utilize RNA silencing methods to explore the specific roles of GATA-1 and GATA-2 transcription factors in promoting its expression. Preparation of Reporter Constructs—Human genomic DNA (Clontech) and DNA purified from clone BAC R-84C 10 (Bacpac Resources, Oakland, CA) were used as templates to amplify extended regions of genomic sequence 5′ to the known transcriptional start site of the EDN gene (20Tiffany H.L. Handen J.S. Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12387-12393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Rosenberg H.F. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The 5′ regions were amplified by PCR in a 50-μl reaction containing 5 μl of 10× buffer, 1.5 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 1 μl of 50 mm MgSO4, 1.5 μl of 10 μm forward primer, 1.5 μl of 10 μm reverse primer, and 1.0 μl (1.25 units) of Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). Reaction conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min. Primers were as follows: EDN 1000 forward, 5′-CGG TAC CTT CCC TAA AGT CCC TGA AAA CTC C-3′; EDN 500 forward, 5′-CGG TAC CTA ATT ATC TAC AGA ATC TTG TGC CCC-3′; EDN 250 forward, 5′-CGG TAC CGC ATA TAG TTT TCA TCC AGA GTT T-3′; and EDN all reverse, 5′-GCT CGA GCT GTA AGA AAA GAA GAG AAG TAA C-3′. KpnI and XhoI restriction sites were added to the ends of both forward and reverse primers, respectively, to facilitate cloning. All the PCR products were gel-purified using GFX PCR DNA and Gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience). A terminal nucleotide was added with the A-Addition kit (Qiagen), and the insert was ligated into the T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen), followed by transformation into TOPO 10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Inserts were verified by sequencing, re-isolated by KpnI and XhoI digestion, and cloned into pGL3 Basic reporter vectors (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Culture—The HL-60 clone 15 human eosinophil promyelocytic leukemic cell line (26Kirshenbaum A.S. Goff J.P. Semere T. Foster B. Scott L.M. Metcalfe D.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPPSO (pH 7.6; Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Unless otherwise indicated, cells at an initial concentration of 5 × 105 per ml were induced with 0.5 mm BA to differentiate them toward an eosinophilic phenotype for 2 days prior to transfection. Transient Transfection Experiments—Culture medium as described was pre-warmed at 37 °C. Uninduced HL-60 clone 15 cells or cells that were BA-induced for 2 days as described above were centrifuged at 90 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and supernatant was discarded. Three million cells were suspended in 100 μl of room temperature Nucleofector solution V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD), followed by addition of plasmid DNA (5 μg of pGL-3 constructs with 50 ng of pRL (Renilla luciferase) transfection control plasmid). The mixture was transferred to an Amaxa-certified cuvette, which was inserted into the cuvette holder of Nucleofector II machine (Amaxa). T-016 program was selected according to the manufacturer's recommendation, and cells were transfected, followed by suspension in 2 ml of pre-warmed culture medium and incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% carbon dioxide prior to harvesting for luciferase assay. Dual Luciferase Assays—The transiently transfected cells described above were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed with once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 80 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (PLB; Promega). The incubation was performed on a rocking platform at room temperature for 15 min, and then luciferase activity was measured using a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Briefly, 100 μl of Luciferase Assay Reagent II (LARII; Promega) was placed into luminometer tubes, and 20 μl of cell lysate was added and pipetted three times prior to reading firefly (FF) luciferase activity. Immediately, 100 μl of Stop & Glo Reagent (Promega) was added and vortexed, and then Renilla luciferase (RL) activity was read. All measurements were repeated three times for each data point. Data are reported as relative light units (FF/RL × 100). Site-directed Mutagenesis of Consensus GATA-binding Sites—The primers for introducing mutations into the identified consensus GATA-binding sites in the extended 5′ promoter region of the EDN gene were designed based on sequence analysis results with the MatInspector program available on line. The primers for site-directed mutagenesis of GATA sites include the following: 5′-CTG AAA ACT CCC TGC GGC GAG TTT AGG GCC CTG CTG-3′ and 5′-CAG CAG GGC CCT AAA CTC GCC GCA GGG AGT TTT CAG-3′ for the GATA -1114 site; 5′-AGC AGA TTG TTT TAA GGC GAG ACA GAA TCT TGT GCC-3′ and 5′-GGC ACA AGA TTC TGT CTC GCC TTA AAA CAA TCT GCT-3′ for the GATA -535 site. Mutant strand synthesis reaction was performed in 50 μl of mixture containing 50 ng of DNA template, 125 ng of each primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 95 °C for 30 s and 18 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 6 min. After the parental double-stranded DNA was digested with DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C, the synthesis products were transformed into XL1-Blue E. coli Supercompetent cells (Stratagene), and then the desired mutations were verified using DNA sequencing (3100 Sequencer, Applied Biosystems). Western Blotting—HL-60 clone 15 cells differentiated for 2 days with 0.5 mm BA or uninduced cells transfected with GATA-2/pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1 vector only (control) as described below were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was washed with PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X) plus 0.1% 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Eschwege, Germany). The cells were lysed and heated for 5 min after adding the identical volume of 2× Tris-glycine SDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen). The proteins were resolved in 14% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane filter paper (Invitrogen). After blocking nonspecific protein binding with 5% nonfat dry milk, blots were incubated with 1:1000 dilutions of monoclonal antibodies to EDN (MBL, Naka-Ku, Japan), GATA-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or GAPDH (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) or GATA-2-specific polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, -rat, and -rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). Immunoconjugates were detected with alkaline phosphatase color-developing reagents (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR—The cells treated as described were homogenized in RNA-Bee RNA Isolation Solvent (at 1 ml per 106 cells, increased five times over the manufacturer's specifications to accommodate increased ribonuclease activity; Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). The total RNA was prepared following the manufacturer's instruction, and its quality was monitored through gel electrophoresis analysis. Genomic DNA contamination was eliminated with DNA-free™ DNase treatment and removal reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was reverse-transcribed in a mixture of 20 μl containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTP, 1.6 μg of oligo-p(dT)15, 50 μl of RNase inhibitor, and 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 1 h, and 99 °C for 5 min. After incubation at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, quantitative PCR was performed in 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min using Taqman® 2× universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The primers for EDN, GATA-1, and GATA-2 were purchased from Applied Biosystems. GATA-2 assay identification was Hs00927739_m1, and probe was 5′-CCC ACG GCT GCG TGT GGC CGT TGC C-3′; EDN assay identification was Hs00795553_s1, and probe was 5′-TCA CCA CAG TGG AAG CCA GGT GCC T-3′; GATA-1 assay identification was Hs00231112_m1, and probe was 5′-CAC CAG CCC AGG TTA ATC CCC AGA G-3′; the probes were labeled with FAM and NFQ. GAPDH expression assay part number was 4326317E used as the endogenous control (VIC/MGB probe). Nuclear Extract Preparation—HL-60 clone 15 cells were differentiated with 0.5 mm BA for 2 days, harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and then washed with ice-cold PBS/phosphatase inhibitor (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). The pellet was gently suspended in 1× Hypotonic Buffer (Active Motif), incubated on ice for 15 min, and vortexed for 10 s after addition of detergent (Active Motif). The mixture was centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 × g and the nuclear pellet was in Complete Lysis Buffer (Active Motif) prior to vortexing for 10 s. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform set at 150 rpm and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C for EMSA. EMSA—The complementary oligonucleotides were labeled separately at their 3′ ends with Biotin-11-UTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Pierce), and then the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was extracted by chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The end-labeled or unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to generate double-stranded DNA, which was stored at -20 °C until needed. The sequences of probes used in EMSA were as follows: GATA -1114, wild type, 5′-CTG AAA ACT CCC TGC TTA TCT TTT AGG GCC CTG CTG-3′, and mutant GATA -1114, 5′-CTG AAA ACT CCC TGC GGC GAG TTT AGG GCC CTG CTG-3′; GATA -535, wild type, 5′-AGC AGA TTG TTT TAA TTA TCT ACA GAA TCT TGT GCC-3′, and mutant GATA -535 5′-AGC AGA TTG TTT TAA GGC GAG ACA GAA TCT TGT GCC-3′. Four μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 4 μl of monoclonal anti-GATA-1 (Active Motif), polyclonal anti-GATA-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody, or no antibody on ice for 20 min prior to the addition of the biotin-labeled probe. The binding reactions contained 2.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of poly(dI·dT), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, labeled probe, nuclear extract, and antibody. For competition, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA fragment was added. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then electrophoresed at 100 V in 6% polyacrylamide DNA retardation gels (Invitrogen) in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. The DNA was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Pierce) and fixed to the membrane using UV cross-linking. The blots were probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) through exposure to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 20-60 s. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—HL-60 Clone 15 cells were induced with 0.5 mm BA for 2 days, and 36% formaldehyde (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1% to cross-link proteins to DNA. Incubation was performed on a stir plate for 10 min at room temperature, and then the cross-linking reaction was stopped using Glycine Stop-Fix Solution as per manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 2500 rpm at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS, and suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold Lysis Buffer supplemented with 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture and 5 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Incubation was performed on ice for 30 min followed by homogenization in an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 1.0 ml of Digestion Buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as above; 50 μl of Enzymatic Shearing Mixture (200 units/ml; Active Motif) was added to shear the chromatin for 10 min. The sheared DNA was diluted 10-fold in Dilution buffer (Upstate; catalog number 20-153) and pre-cleared by adding 60 μl of protein G-agarose (Upstate) in 1 h of incubation at 4 °C with rotation, followed by removing agarose by a centrifugation of 4000 × g. Ten μl of pre-cleared DNA was saved as the input template (cross-linked DNA, and the other was used in the immunoprecipitation reaction. For the negative control, 5 μg of preimmune rabbit IgG or mouse IgG was added; the test antibodies included 10 μg of rabbit anti-human GATA-1 anti-peptide antibody (Active Motif) or mouse anti-human GATA-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C with rotation. 60 μl of protein G-agarose was added to the chromatin-protein with antibody mixture and incubated together for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein G-agarose-antibody/chromatin complex was pelleted, washed with Low Salt Immune Complex wash buffer, High Low Salt Immune Complex wash buffer, LiCl Immune Complex wash buffer, and TE Buffer (Upstate). Protein-DNA complex was eluted from protein G-agarose with 200 μl of elution buffer (10 μl 20% SDS, 20 μl of 1 m NaHCO3 and 170 μl of H2O). For all samples, including input, negative control and experimental reverse cross-linking of protein/DNA was performed to isolate free DNA. Specifically, for each sample, 8 μl of 5 m NaCl was added, and incubation was performed at 65 °C for 5 h, and then 1 μl of RNase A was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 8 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, and 1 μl of proteinase K were added, and incubation was performed at 45 °C for 2 h. The resulting DNA was purified using spin columns (Upstate), and PCR was performed on a 50-μl sample containing 2 μl of DNA prepared as above, 5 μl of 10× buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and 0.5 μl of DNA polymerase. For the -1114 consensus GATA site in the EDN promoter, forward primer is 5′-CTGTGCCCAGAATGCTCATC-3′ and reverse primer is 5′-GCTTGAGGGACAAGGAAGACT-3′; for the -535 consensus GATA site, the forward primer is 5′-AGTGGATCCAATGCAAGAGG-3′ and reverse primer is 5′-TGAGCTATTAATTTCTTAGGGCACA-3′. PCR conditions were 3 min of 94 °C followed by 34 cycles of 20 s of 94 °C, 30 s of 58 °C, and 30 s of 72 °C. RNA Silencing (siRNA)—The siRNA sequences commercially obtained from Ambion were 5′-GGU ACU CAG UGC ACC AAC UTT-3′ (GATA-1 siRNA), 5′-GGC UCG UUC CUG UUC AGA ATT-3′(GATA-2 siRNA 1), 5′-GGA GGA GGA UUG UGC UGA UTT-3′(GATA-2 siRNA 2). Negative control was Silencer Negative Control 1 siRNA (Ambion catalog number 4611). Three μg of siRNA was transfected into 2 × 106 clone 15 cells in 100 μl of Nucleofector Solution V (Amaxa) with T-016 program using Nucleofector II machine (Amaxa) as described above. The cells were then differentiated with BA and harvested 48 h later, and the total RNA was isolated with RNA-Bee RNA Isolation Solvent (1 ml per 106 cells) (Tel-Test, Inc). Quantitative PCR was used to analyze the extent to which levels of transcripts were reduced, and expression of protein encoding GATA-1, GATA-2, and EDN was evaluated by Western blotting. GATA-2 Overexpression—cDNA encoding human GATA-2 (GenBank™ NM_032638) was isolated from BA-induced HL-60 clone 15 cells by RT-PCR using Pfx polymerase, forward primer 5′-CGG AAG CTT GCC GCC GGC CAT GGA GGT GGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTT TCT AGA CTA CCC CAT GGC GGT CAC CA-3′, which includes restriction sites and a Kozak sequence at the start of translation. The insert was cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1/Zeo and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Three μg of GATA-2/pCDNA3.1 (pGATA-2) or pCDNA3.1 vector alone (pctrl) were transfected into 2 × 106 uninduced HL-60 clone 15 cells in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution V (Amaxa), T-016 program, Nucleofector II. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of complete medium, and after 2 days, cells were harvested, and RNA was prepared using the qPCR-Grade RNA isolation kit (SuperArray Bioscience), and quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described. Culture and Differentiation of Human Umbilical Cord and Peripheral Blood CD34+ Cells—Human umbilical cord CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (Stemcell Technologies, catalog number CB008F) or CD34+ progenitors from peripheral blood from healthy human donors pre-stimulated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (a generous gift from Dr. Arnold Kirshenbaum, MCBS, LAD (26Kirshenbaum A.S.

Blood. 1999; 94: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were cultured at 0.3 × 106 cells per ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 units/ml streptomycin (basic medium), and cytokines, including stem cell factor (50 ng/ml), FLT-3L (50 ng/ml), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (5 ng/ml), IL-3 (5 ng/ml), and IL-5 (5 ng/ml, all cytokines from R & D Systems), as per Bedi et al. (27Bedi R. Du J. Sharma A.K. Gomes I. Ackerman S.J. Blood. 2009; 113: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After 3 days in culture, the medium was changed, and cells were maintained in the basic medium with cytokines IL-3 (5 ng/ml) and IL-5 (5 ng/ml) alone, at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml for the remainder of the experiment. Eosinophil differentiation over 21 days was monitored by modified Giemsa staining of cytocentrifuge cell preparations and EDN transcript levels. Suppression of GATA-2 Transcription in Eosinophil Progenitors Derived from CD34+ Cells—Recombinant lentiviral particles delivering shRNA to suppress GATA-2 transcription together with puromycin resistance were assembled in HEK293 cells as per the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma Mission shRNA, with control plasmid pLK0.1 or with GATA-2 shRNA). 5 × 106 differentiating cells were transduced at day 14 of culture; 2 days later, fresh medium with cytokines IL-3 (5 ng/ml) and IL-5 (5 ng/ml) was supplemented with puromycin (2 μg/ml, the optimal concentration determined by serial dilution, as per manufacturer's instructions). Cells were harvested 5 days later for quantitative RT-PCR. Statistical Considerations—All luciferase and quantitative PCR data represent compilations from three separate experiments with each data point from each experiment representing a trial performed in triplicate. Statistical significance determined by Student's t test and Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Expression of EDN, GATA-1, and GATA-2 in the HL-60 Clone 15 Eosinophil Promyelocyte Cell Line—The clone 15 subline of the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line has properties of an eosinophil progenitor when maintained under alkaline conditions. Addition of BA results in differentiation into cells with features characteristic of maturing human eosinophils (28Fischkoff S.A. Pollak A. Gleich G.J. Testa J.R. Misawa S. Reber T.J. J. Exp.

We observe a 25-fold increase in EDN mRNA in response to BA at day 3 (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous results (9Zon L.I. Yamaguchi Y. Yee K. Albee E.A. Kimura A. Bennett J.C. Orkin S.H.

BA-induced differentiation of HL-60 clone 15 cells also results in augmented transcription of GATA-1 (Fig. 1B) and GATA-2 (Fig. 1C), reaching levels 50- and 20-fold over base line, respectively, at day 3.

https://openalex.org/W1973143550,"The molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in the Caribbean has been described using partial genome sequencing; subtype B is the most common subtype in multiple countries. To expand our knowledge of this, nearly full genome amplification, sequencing and analysis was conducted.Virion RNA from sera collected in Haiti, Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago were reverse transcribed, PCR amplified, sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Nearly full genomes were completed for 15 strains; partial pol was done for 67 strains. All but one of the 67 strains analyzed in pol were subtype B; the exception was a unique recombinant of subtypes B and C collected in the Dominican Republic. Of the nearly full genomes of 14 strains that were subtype B in pol, all were subtype B from one end of the genome to the other and not inter-subtype recombinants. Surprisingly, the Caribbean subtype B strains clustered significantly with each other and separate from subtype B from other parts of the pandemic.The more complete analysis of HIV-1 from 4 Caribbean countries confirms previous research using partial genome analysis that the predominant subtype in circulation was subtype B. The Caribbean strains are phylogenetically distinct from other subtype B strains although the biological meaning of this finding is unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1994387933,"Background CD23 is a differentiation/activation antigen expressed by a variety of hematopoietic and epithelial cells. It can also be detected in soluble forms in biological fluids. Initially known as the low-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcεRII), CD23 displays various other physiologic ligands such as CD21, CD11b/c, CD47-vitronectin, and mannose-containing proteins. CD23 mediates numerous immune responses by enhancing IgE-specific antigen presentation, regulating IgE synthesis, influencing cell differentiation and growth of both B- and T-cells. CD23-crosslinking promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators from human monocytes/macrophages, eosinophils and epithelial cells. Increased CD23 expression is found in patients during allergic reactions and rheumatoid arthritis while its physiopathologic role in these diseases remains to be clarified. Methodology/Principal Findings We previously generated heptapeptidic countrestructures of human CD23. Based on in vitro studies on healthy and arthritic patients' cells, we showed that CD23-specific peptide addition to human macrophages greatly diminished the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines. This was also confirmed by significant reduction of mediator levels in cell supernatants. We also show that CD23 peptide decreased IgE-mediated activation of both human and rat CD23+ macrophages. In vivo studies in rat model of arthritis showed that CD23-blocking peptide ameliorates clinical scores and prevent bone destruction in a dose dependent manner. Ex-vivo analysis of rat macrophages further confirmed the inhibitory effect of peptides on their activation. Taken together our results support the role of CD23 activation and subsequent inflammatory response in arthritis. Conclusion CD23-blocking peptide (p30A) prevents the activation of monocytes/macrophages without cell toxicity. Thus, targeting CD23 by antagonistic peptide decreases inflammatory markers and may have clinical value in the treatment of human arthritis and allergic reactions involving CD23."
https://openalex.org/W2042171851,"The recurrence and non-random distribution of translocation breakpoints in human tumors are usually attributed to local sequence features present in the vicinity of the breakpoints. However, it has also been suggested that functional constraints might contribute to delimit the position of translocation breakpoints within the genes involved, but a quantitative analysis of such contribution has been lacking.We have analyzed two well-known signatures of functional selection, such as reading-frame compatibility and non-random combinations of protein domains, on an extensive dataset of fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal translocations in cancer.Our data provide strong experimental support for the concept that the position of translocation breakpoints in the genome of cancer cells is determined, to a large extent, by the need to combine certain protein domains and to keep an intact reading frame in fusion transcripts. Additionally, the information that we have assembled affords a global view of the oncogenic mechanisms and domain architectures that are used by fusion proteins. This can be used to assess the functional impact of novel chromosomal translocations and to predict the position of breakpoints in the genes involved."

The properties of the reciprocal MALT1-API2 were never investigated as it was reported to be rarely transcribed.Our data indicate the presence of MALT1-API2 transcripts in the majority of t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphomas. Based on the breakpoints in the MALT1 and API2 gene, the MALT1-API2 protein contains the death domain and one or both immunoglobulin-like domains of MALT1 (approximately 90% of cases)--mediating the possible interaction with BCL10--fused to the RING domain of API2. Here we show that this RING domain enables MALT1-API2 to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for BCL10, inducing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in vitro. Expression of MALT1-API2 transcripts in t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive MALT lymphomas was however not associated with a reduction of BCL10 protein levels.As we observed MALT1-API2 to be an efficient target of its own E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, our data suggest that this inherent instability of MALT1-API2 prevents its accumulation and renders a potential effect on MALT lymphoma development via destabilization of BCL10 unlikely."

To elucidate the in vivo function of LIN9 during vertebrate development, we took advantage of the teleost zebrafish (Danio rerio). By means of antisense morpholinos we show here that Lin9-depleted embryonic cells accumulate in mitosis. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy data demonstrate that the delay in mitotic progression is followed by apoptosis, which strongly manifests in the developing central nervous system. In accordance with these findings, we identified a cohort of Lin9-regulated genes required for different mitotic processes, including mitotic entry, metaphase/anaphase transition, and cytokinesis.

Our data establish LIN9 as an essential regulator of mitosis in vertebrate development. The transition from G1 to S phase marks the starting point of the eukaryotic cell to replicate its chromosomal set of DNA. This event is followed by the G2 period that prepares the cell for mitosis, a process that results in the separation of the duplicate chromosome set into two nuclei. The progression through the cell cycle is regulated by multiple processes, including regulated gene transcription. For example, E2F transcription factors play a key role in the activation of S phase entry genes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 1Dimova D.K. Dyson N.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2810-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Likewise, several transcription factors are implicated to play a role in the activation of mitotic genes during S phase, among them NF-Y, B-MYB, and FOXM1 (2Zhu W. Giangrande P.H. Nevins J.R.

LINC/DREAM is a recently identified multiprotein complex that is required for two transcriptional processes that act on cell cycle regulation, namely repression of genes that drive G1/S transition and activation of genes required for G2/M progression (3Osterloh L. von Eyss B.

Interestingly, LINC/DREAM undergoes a dynamic and cell cycle-dependent switch of subunits (7Schmit F. Korenjak M. Mannefeld M. Schmitt K. Franke C. von Eyss B. Gagrica S. Hanel F. Brehm A. Gaubatz S.

In G0/G1, the complex is associated with p130 and E2F4, whereas in late S phase it interacts with B-MYB and activates G2/M promoters. LINC/DREAM is evolutionarily highly conserved. A DREAM-like complex was first purified from Drosophila embryo lysates and was named Myb-MuvB (MMB) or dREAM (for Drosophila RBF-, dE2F2-, and dMyb-interacting proteins) (9Lewis P.W. Beall E.L.

Although initially described as complexes involved in the repression of E2F target genes during fly development, a recent study indicates that dREAM/Myb-MuvB also regulate the activation of genes required for mitotic progression (11Georlette D. Ahn S. MacAlpine D.M. Cheung E. Lewis P.W. Beall E.L. Bell S.P. Speed T. Manak J.R. Botchan M.R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2880-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a related complex has also been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (12Harrison M.M. Ceol C.J. Lu X. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

B-MYB, a subunit of the activating LINC complex in S phase and G2, is essential for early mouse embryogenesis, and its short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown in murine ES cells results in a delay of G2/M progression, mitotic spindle and centrosome defects, and polyploidy (13Tanaka Y.

PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, the bmyb loss-of-function mutation crash&burn (crb) results in a similar phenotype. crb fish exhibit defects in spindle formation and show genomic instability (15Shepard J.L. Amatruda J.F. Stern H.M. Subramanian A. Finkelstein D. Ziai J. Finley K.R. Pfaff K.L. Hersey C. Zhou Y. Barut B. Freedman M. Lee C. Spitsbergen J. Neuberg D. Weber G. Golub T.R. Glickman J.N.

We and others have shown that LIN9, a core subunit of LINC, activates G2/M genes in human cells together with B-MYB. Mice carrying an 84-amino acid N-terminal deletion LIN9 have recently been generated (16Sandoval R. Xue J. Tian X. Barrett K. Pilkinton M. Ucker D.S. Raychaudhuri P. Kineman R.D. Luque R.M. Baida G.

However, except for a mild increase in body size, they do not show any obvious phenotype. Since highly conserved regions of LIN9 are still retained, it is unlikely that Δ84 LIN9 represents a complete loss-of-function protein. Thus, the role of LIN9 in vertebrate development is still unclear. To address the role of LIN9 in vertebrate development we now used zebrafish as a model system. We found that lin9 is essential for early zebrafish development. The loss of lin9 leads to an accumulation of embryonic cells in mitosis and an increase of apoptosis. Genome-wide gene expression analysis shows that Lin9 regulates a cluster of genes required for mitotic processes, among them the G2/M and the spindle assembly checkpoint, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Our data suggest an overlap of B-MYB and LIN9 function throughout vertebrate development and establish the latter as a critical regulator of mitotic progression. Morpholino and mRNA Injections—TÜAB zebrafish were maintained and staged as described (17Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio).

Embryos were kept in 1× Danieau solution (58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.6 mm Ca(NO3)2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.0001% methylene blue). Morpholinos (Gene Tools, Philomath, OR) were designed against Danio rerio lin9 homolog (GenBank™ accession NM_001044946). The morpholino (MO) sequences were as follows: MO-ATG, 5′-CTCGAGCTCCGCCATCTTGAATTAG-3′; MO-E1, 5′-GTTAGTTTTATTACTCACTCTCGTC-3′; 5-base mismatch morpholino MO-E1mis, 5′-GTTACTTTTAATACTGACTGTCCTC-3′. The indicated amounts of morpholinos were injected into one- or two-cell stage embryos. To follow morpholino uptake, a small amount (3.5 pmol) of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Sigma) was cooinjected. For capped RNA synthesis, plasmids containing full-length cDNAs for lin9 and ccnb1 (clone IRBOp991B0331D, obtained from imaGenes (Berlin, Germany)) were used. Linearized plasmids were transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription (RT), PCR, and Cloning—20 embryos were dechorionated, washed in PBS, transferred to a 2 ml tube and homogenized in RLT buffer (Qiagen) with a micropestle. Total RNA was purified by means of an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 0.65 μg of RNA were applied to RT by incubation with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)17 primer and 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a total volume of 25 μl. For end point PCR, we used the following primers: ef1a (NM_131263, bases 415-969), forward (5′-TGATTGTTGCTGGTGGTGTT-3′) and reverse (5′-GAGACTCGTGGTGCATCTCA-3′); lin54 (NM_001076567, bases 2037-2392), forward (5′-AGGCTGCAACTGCAAGAAAT-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTGCGGTTGATTGGTAAGT-3′); bmyb (NM_ 001003867, bases 797-1185), forward (5′-AGAACTGCCTGTCGAATGCT-3′) and reverse (5′-GACTCAGGATGGATGGAGGA-3′); lin9 (NM_001044946, bases 502-1043), forward (5′-AGTTGACCCGAGTTGAATGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CAGAGTCTCTCCGTCGGTTC-3′). For whole mount in situ hybridizations, the PCR product generated with the last pair of primers was TA-cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). Clones were obtained with inserts in sense and antisense orientation. For amplification of full-length zebrafish lin9, we used the following primers: forward, 5′-TTTTGGATCCATGGCGGAGCTCGAGCAGCT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTCACGTTCTGTTGGTGTTGTTT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3 via BamHI and NotI restriction sites. Sequencing revealed that lin9 cDNA differed from GenBank™ accession number NM_001044946 in bases 155 (G to T) and 434 (T to A), resulting in an alteration of amino acid residue 39 (Gln to His). Quantitative PCR was performed using ABsolute™ QPCR SYBR Green Mix (ThermoScientific, Epsom, UK) and the Mx3000P real time detection system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: actb (NM_131031, bases 10-100), forward (5′-GATCTTCACTCCCCTTGTTCA-3′) and reverse (5′-ATACCGGAGCCGTTGTCA-3′); pif1 (NM_ 198807, bases 1697-1774), forward (5′-GCAGCTGCCACTCAAACTG-3′) and reverse (5′-GAGATCTCCACACAATCCAGAGT-3′); aspm (ENSDART00000105631, bases 1697-1774), forward (5′-GCCCTTAAATCAGCCAAGAA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTCTCTGCAGTTTTGCCCTAA-3′); top2a (NM_001003834, bases 2961-3034), forward (5′-CACCACCATCGAGATCACAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCAACACATTCTCCTTATAGGTCA-3′); cdc20 (NM_213080, bases 1317-1389), forward (5′-AATGCTTCCAGTGGCTCTTG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGGGTGCAAAAACAAGAGAAG-3′); oip5 (XM_001339446, bases 260-335), forward (5′-GACTCTCTCGGCGTCTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCATCACATCCTCAGTAACTTTCA-3′); bax (NM_131562, bases 312-418), forward (5′-GCCCGTGAGATCTTCTCTGA-3′) and reverse (5′-TCAGGAACCCTGGTTGAAAT-3′); tnfb (NM_001024447, bases 238-312), forward (5′-GGTCAGAAACCCAACAGAGAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CACTTTTCCGTGGTCTGAGG-3′). Triplicate mean values were calculated according to the ct quantification method using the actb transcript level as reference for normalization (19Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25584) Google Scholar). Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—pCRII-lin9 vectors (see “RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription (RT), PCR, and Cloning”) were linearized with XhoI. pif1 (NM_198807, bases 168-810), aspm (ENSDART00000105631, bases 621-1370), top2a (NM_001003834, bases 3785-4401), and oip5 (XM_001339446, bases 40-646) templates were amplified from cDNA with reverse primers providing the SP6 promoter sequence. In vitro transcription was performed using SP6 polymerase and the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out as previously described (17Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1993Google Scholar). Nitro blue tetrazolium/bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science) served as a substrate for color development. Flow Cytometry—Upon removal of the chorion, 10 embryos were washed in PBS and transferred to a collection tube. Embryos were homogenized with a micropestle in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum at 4 °C, passed through a 30-μm filter (Beckman Coulter), collected in a 15-ml tube, and centrifuged at 1200 rpm at 4 °C. Cells were washed once in PBS and stained in DNA buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 154 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 μg/ml RNase, 30 μg/ml propidium iodide) for at least 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. DNA content was analyzed with a Cytomics FC 500 (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer. Apoptosis Detection—72-h zebrafish embryos were incubated for 30 min in 5 μg/ml acridine orange in PBS and subsequently washed twice for 20 min in PBS at room temperature. For microscopic examination embryos were transferred into ice-cold PBS, 0.01% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester methane sulfonate. Terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed as described elsewhere (20Herpin A. Schindler D. Kraiss A. Hornung U. Winkler C. Schartl M. BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Embryos were fixed and prepared as described previously (21Wagner T.U. Kraeussling M. Fedorov L.M. Reiss C. Kneitz B. Schartl M. Stem Cells Dev. 2009; 18: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For DNA staining, embryos were incubated in 10 μg/ml Hoechst (PBS) for 30 min. For imaging, Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) SP2 and SP5 inverted confocal systems were used. The resulting multidimensional stacks were analyzed using ImageJ version 1.41 (National Institutes of Health) and Volocity 4/5 (Improvision, Coventry, UK) software. Gene Expression Analysis—20 embryos/condition (MO-E1; MO-E1mis) were pooled for RNA purification 24 h postfertilization. Using the two-color Quick-Amp Labeling Kit (catalog number 5190-0444; Agilent), 100 ng of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis, mRNA amplification, and labeling according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transcriptional profiling was done on a zebrafish oligonucleotide array (catalog number G2519F AMADID 019161; Agilent) in a 4 × 44,000 slide format and analyzed as described before (22Kleinschmidt M.A. Streubel G. Samans B. Krause M. Bauer U.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Expression data and gene annotations were stored in Array Express (available on the World Wide Web) (accession number A-MEXP-1510), which complies with MIAME (minimal information about a microarray experiment) guidelines. For experimental comparisons, genes showing at least a 1.6-fold change were chosen. lin9 Is Expressed throughout Zebrafish Embryonic Development—To analyze lin9 expression in zebrafish embryogenesis, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization on paraformaldehyde-fixed embryos at 0.45, 16, 32, and 48 h postfertilization (2-cell, 14-somite, Prim-16, and Long-pec stage, respectively). The probe was designed targeting bases 502-1043 of lin9 mRNA (NM_001044946). Blast analysis, even under lowest stringency conditions, did not reveal any target other than lin9. Transcripts of lin9 were detected throughout embryogenesis. Expression was ubiquitous at the first embryonic day and became restricted to the head region, most notably to the optic tectum of the mesencephalon at later stages of development (Fig. 1A). Because the lin9 message is already present at the two-cell stage and because zebrafish zygotic transcription arises at the midblastula transition (1000-cell stage), these data indicate that lin9 is a maternally derived transcript. We independently confirmed these results by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1B). Other members of the LINC complex, namely lin54 and bmyb, are also expressed during early zebrafish embryogenesis (Fig. 1B). lin9 Is Essential for Early Zebrafish Development—To analyze the role of lin9 in early zebrafish development, we designed an antisense MO that targets the splice donor site of exon 1 of the lin9 transcript (MO-E1; Fig. 2A). To confirm that MO-E1 indeed inhibits the correct splicing of the lin9 message, we microinjected 7 ng of MO-E1 into the yolk of one- or two-cell stage embryos and analyzed the lin9 message by semiquantitative RT-PCR 3 days later. As shown in Fig. 2B, the band corresponding to the spliced lin9 message is strongly reduced upon injection of MO-E1. In addition, a shorter message that arises from the use of a cryptic splice site can be detected in MO-E1-injected zebrafish embryos. We further confirmed both PCR products by sequencing. A schematic representation of the cryptic variant is depicted in supplemental Fig. 1. Next, we microinjected embryos with MO-E1 and followed their development. In order to exclude off-target or secondary effects, we included a control morpholino (MO-E1mis) in our experiments. MO-E1mis differs from the E1 morpholino in 5 bases (see “Experimental Procedures”). MO-E1mis-injected embryos developed virtually identically compared with uninjected wild type embryos. In stark contrast, at day 2 of development, MO-E1-injected zebrafish embryos (morphants) had slightly smaller heads than uninjected or control-injected embryos. At day 3, in almost all lin9 morphants, a stronger phenotype was evident. Specifically, ME-E1-injected embryos had a small head, small eyes, pericardial edema, and a strong trunk curvature (Fig. 2C). When we tested various amounts of MO-E1, we found that 3.4 ng was sufficient to induce the morphant phenotype in 73.1% of all embryos (Table 1). Higher doses of the morpholino increased the fraction of zebrafish with the morphant phenotype but did not alter the phenotype. Importantly, however, when embryos were coinjected with 3.4 ng of MO-E1 and 0.2 ng of in vitro transcribed lin9 mRNA, only 46% of the embryos showed the morphant phenotype, strongly suggesting that the phenotype arises due to the inhibition of lin9 expression. Injection of lin9 mRNA alone did not result in phenotypical alterations (data not shown). Furthermore, a second lin9-specific morpholino (MO-ATG) that is predicted to interfere with the translation of the lin9 message showed the same phenotype as MO-E1 (Fig. 2C). Since two morpholinos targeting lin9 induced the same phenotype and since this phenotype was partially rescued by the lin9 mRNA, we conclude that the morphant phenotype is due to the loss of Lin9.TABLE 1Summary of mopholino and mRNA injectionsMorpholinoAmountmRNAns.h.aSmall head.

Open table in a new tab Lin9 Regulates the Embryonic Cell Cycle—Next, we analyzed the embryonic cell cycles of lin9 morphant embryos by flow cytometry 30 and 48 h after fertilization. Injection of both lin9-specific morpholinos, but not MO-E1mis, resulted in a decrease of cells in G1 and an increase of cells with a G2/M DNA content (Fig. 3A). In addition, a large number of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content were detected in lin9 morphants, suggesting that cells undergo apoptosis or necrosis upon loss of Lin9. Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of Lin9 leads to an accumulation of cells in G2/M and an increase of cell death during zebrafish embryogenesis. Apoptosis and Accumulation of Mitotic Cells in lin9 Morphant Brains—The number of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content strongly increased in lin9 morphants between 24 and 48 h after fertilization (Fig. 4C). To further analyze cell death in lin9 morphants, we used acridine orange to visualize apoptotic areas under the fluorescence microscope in 72-h-old zebrafish embryos. As shown in Fig. 4A, the olfactory regions of uninjected and control injected (E1mis) embryos were stained by acridine orange, indicating physiologically occurring apoptosis (23Cole L.K. Ross L.S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 123-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in lin9 morphant brains, fluorescence-positive areas were much more widely distributed compared with control embryos, suggesting massive apoptosis in the developing brain upon loss of Lin9. To independently confirm apoptosis in the morphants, we made use of the TUNEL assay (Fig. 4B). These experiments confirmed enhanced apoptosis in the heads of 48 h morphants, most strikingly in the central nervous system and olfactory region. To further substantiate this observation, we took confocal images of Hoechst-stained embryonic nuclei 30 h after fertilization. We noticed a plethora of apoptotic bodies in brains of lin9 morphant embryos but not in control embryos. Overall, about 20% of all nuclei showed an abnormal morphology, including nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation, which are known features of programmed cell death (Fig. 5, bottom). Second, quantification revealed a more than 3-fold higher number of mitotic cells in the developing brain of morphant embryos compared with uninjected embryos. This suggests that the increase in the fraction of cells in G2/M observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis is, at least in part, due to accumulation of cells in mitosis. Importantly, the increase in apoptotic and mitotic cells was also observed in the developing brains of zebrafish embryos injected with MO-ATG (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these findings indicate that developing cells in the zebrafish brain undergo apoptosis upon loss of Lin9, possibly preceded by mitotic defects. Lin9 Regulates a Cohort of Genes Required for Mitosis—Because in human cells, LIN9 regulates the expression of genes that are required for entry into mitosis, including cyclin B1 (3Osterloh L. von Eyss B. Schmit F. Rein L. Hubner D. Samans B. Hauser S. Gaubatz S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Pilkinton M. Sandoval R. Song J. Ness S.A. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 168-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we next asked whether inhibition of cyclin B1 is responsible for the observed phenotype. To address this possibility, we first analyzed the expression of cyclin B1 in lin9 morphants by RT-qPCR. Cyclin B1 was indeed slightly down-regulated in MO-ATG as well as in MO-E1 morphant embryos (Fig. 6A). Next, we asked whether cyclin B1 expression can restore a normal cell cycle profile in lin9 morphants. To address this question, we coinjected MO-E1 with in vitro transcribed cyclin B1 mRNA. As a positive control, we coinjected MO-E1 with lin9 mRNA. As expected, lin9 mRNA greatly reduced both cell death and G2/M accumulation when coinjected with MO E1 (Fig. 6B). However, cyclin B1 mRNA neither rescued the accumulation of cells in G2/M nor prevented the apoptosis upon injection of MO-E1. These observations indicate that inhibition of cyclin B1 is not sufficient to explain the lin9 morphant phenotype. Therefore, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis using a zebrafish oligonucleotide microarray to identify genes regulated by Lin9 during zebrafish development. We compared gene expression profiles of morphant (E1) and control-injected (E1mis) embryos 24 h after fertilization, a time when cell cycle defects first become detectable by flow cytometry (data not shown). The microarray analysis identified 109 genes that were down-regulated and 49 genes that were up-regulated more than 1.6-fold in the lin9 morphants (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. 3). Interestingly, although genes required for the G1/S transition were not affected by the inhibition of Lin9, at least 25% of the down-regulated genes function in mitosis (Fig. 7A and supplemental Fig. 3). These genes encode for proteins required for entry into mitosis, spindle assembly, centrosome formation, metaphase/anaphase transition, and cytokinesis (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Microarray analysis reveals that mitotic genes are down-regulated in lin9 morphants.

As a control, we also included cDNA from uninjected and MO-ATG-injected embryos. The expression levels of all genes tested, including pif1, aspm, top2a, and oip5, were down-regulated in both MO-E1 and MO-ATG morphant zebrafish compared with control injected (E1mis) and uninjected embryos. To independently confirm these results, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization on 24 h MO-E1- and MO-E1mis-injected embryos with probes directed at pif1, aspm, top2a, and oip5 (Fig. 7D). As expected, MO-E1-injected embryos displayed a weaker signal for all probes compared with MO-E1mis embryos. These results together with the findings presented above support a role for Lin9 in the regulation of mitotic progression during zebrafish development. Although we detected enhanced apoptosis in Lin9-deficient embryos (Figs. 4 and 5), we did not detect a significant enrichment of apoptosis-related genes in the microarray experiment. However, one apoptosis-related gene up-regulated in lin9 morphants is tnfb (supplemental Fig. 3). Tnfb is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and shows 51% similarity with human LTA/TNFB. RT-qPCR showed that tnfb is up-regulated at least 1.7-fold in both MO-E1- and MO-ATG-injected embryos. We also analyzed the expression of bax, a proapoptotic and bona fide p53 target gene (supplemental Fig. 4). In contrast to tnfb, bax expression was unaltered in lin9 morphants. Here, we made use of the zebrafish as a vertebrate model, whose rapid embryogenesis ex utero allowed us to study the in vivo function of lin9 by morpholino injection. Loss of Lin9 causes an increase of cell number in mitosis, which is most likely ascribed to the down-regulation of a cohort of mitotic genes we identified by gene expression analysis. LIN9-dependent genes regulate different mitotic processes. For instance, KIFC1 and KIF11 are kinesins required for proper spindle formation (24Zhu C. Zhao J. Bibikova M. Leverson J.D. Bossy-Wetzel E.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas KIF20B/MPP1 and KIF23 exert their function in cytokinesis (26Abaza A. Soleilhac J.M. Westendorf J. Piel M. Crevel I. Roux A. Pirollet F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27844-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Liu X. Zhou T. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. J.

CDC20 and UBCH10 are known regulators of the anaphase-promoting complex (29Hwang L.H. Lau L.F. Smith D.L. Mistrot C.A. Hardwick K.G. Hwang E.S. Amon A. Murray A.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 30Summers M.K. Pan B. Mukhyala K. Jackson P.K. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 544-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CDC14 dephosphorylates securin, which in turn allows the ubiquitination of securin by the anaphase-promoting complex (31Holt L.J. Krutchinsky A.N. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2008; 454: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, CDC14 promotes securin destruction and consequently activation of separase, ultimately leading to sister chromatid separation. NUSAP (nucleolar and spindle-associated protein) is ubiquitinated by the anaphase-promoting complex, and its depletion results in aberrant mitotic spindles, defective chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis (32Raemaekers T. Ribbeck K. Beaudouin J. Annaert W. Van Camp M. Stockmans I. Smets N. Bouillon R. Ellenberg J. Carmeliet G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Li L. Zhou Y. Sun L. Xing G. Tian C. Sun J. Zhang L. He F. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, Sunkel and co-workers (34Coelho P.A. Queiroz-Machado J. Carmo A.M. Moutinho-Pereira S. Maiato H. Sunkel C.E. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that TOP2A positively regulates Aurora B kinase activity, thereby ensuring proper sister chromatid separation. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of TACC3 in HeLa cells results in a reduction of Aurora B kinase and BUBR1 levels at the kinetochores (35Schneider L. Essmann F. Kletke A. Rio P. Hanenberg H. Wetzel W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nurnberg B. Piekorz R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29273-29283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken together, the majority of newly identified targets of LIN9 are involved in various mitotic processes, including a preference for the metaphase/anaphase switch. LIN9 has been reported as a repressor of genes required for G1/S transition in human cells (5Litovchick L. Sadasivam S. Florens L. Zhu X. Swanson S.K. Velmurugan S. Chen R. Washburn M.P. Liu X.S. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 539-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The fact that lin9 morphants show a reduced amount of cells in G1 might point to this repressive function (Fig. 3). However, one would expect an increase in the amount of S phase cells if Lin9 depletion shortens the G1 phase. Since this is not the case and since we found that lin9 morphant cells accumulate in mitosis, we assume that the decrease of cell number in G1 is explained by the increase in G2/M. Thus, Lin9 is mainly required for mitosis and not the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that we did not identify G1/S-regulatory genes in our microarray approach (supplemental Fig. 3). The cooperation of LIN9 and B-MYB as members of the LINC/DREAM complex in S phase has been reported for human cells and invertebrate models as well (3Osterloh L. von Eyss B. Schmit F. Rein L. Hubner D. Samans B. Hauser S. Gaubatz S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Georlette D. Ahn S. MacAlpine D.M. Cheung E. Lewis P.W. Beall E.L. Bell S.P. Speed T. Manak J.R. Botchan M.R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2880-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Hence, we expected that both proteins also conjointly regulate cell cycle genes during zebrafish development. Indeed, we find a clear overlap of the lin9 morphant phenotype with the bmyb loss-of-function mutant crb. Aspm, cdc2, cdc20, tacc3, kif23, kif11, anln, and oip5 are down-regulated in both bmyb- and lin9-deficient embryos (15Shepard J.L. Amatruda J.F. Stern H.M. Subramanian A. Finkelstein D. Ziai J. Finley K.R. Pfaff K.L. Hersey C. Zhou Y. Barut B. Freedman M. Lee C. Spitsbergen J. Neuberg D. Weber G. Golub T.R. Glickman J.N. Kutok J.L. Aster J.C. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13194-13199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, crb embryos display an accumulation of cells in G2/M, increased apoptosis, and small heads. However, cyclin B mRNA injection partially rescued the crb but not the lin9 morphant phenotype (15Shepard J.L. Amatruda J.F. Stern H.M. Subramanian A. Finkelstein D. Ziai J. Finley K.R. Pfaff K.L. Hersey C. Zhou Y. Barut B. Freedman M. Lee C. Spitsbergen J. Neuberg D. Weber G. Golub T.R. Glickman J.N. Kutok J.L. Aster J.C. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13194-13199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is thinkable that B-Myb only partially relies on Lin9 in gene activation, and in turn, Lin9 might regulate some G2/M genes independently of B-Myb. A complete loss-of-function mutation of lin9 might finally unravel the degree of Lin9 and B-Myb cooperation in zebrafish development. We found the most striking phenotypic outcome of lin9 morphants in the central nervous system (i.e. an unusually high number of mitotic cells and apoptotic bodies) (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 2). This phenotype is consistent with the expression of lin9 in zebrafish development. During the pharyngula period (24-48 hpf), the highest lin9 transcript levels were detected in the optic tectum. Given that the optic tectum represents a highly proliferative area during early stages of zebrafish embryogenesis, we speculate that expression of lin9 is functionally connected with its requirement in embryonic cell cycle regulation (36Wullimann M.F. Knipp S. Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 2000; 202: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Mueller T. Wullimann M.F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 140: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cell cycle abnormalities are first detectable at the end of the segmentation period (22-24 h after fertilization) in lin9 morphants. These effects seem to be relatively late compared with other vertebrates but are not surprising given that the embryo derives an abundant level of maternal factors that ensure development even after the initiation of embryonic gene expression (38Pelegri F. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 535-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in the majority of essential genes in zebrafish result in cell death of the developing central nervous system, including the Lin9 target genes kif23, kif11, cdc2, plk1, and top2a (39Amsterdam A. Nissen R.M. Sun Z. Swindell E.C. Farrington S. Hopkins N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12792-12797Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Therefore, lin9 is essential for embryogenesis, because it activates factors that themselves regulate essential cellular processes. We do not know when lin9 morphant cells exit the cell cycle to undergo apoptosis and whether this depends on failures in mitotic progression. However, our flow cytometry data show that the mitotic delay is first detectable shortly before apoptosis arises (data not shown). We therefore speculate that the delay in mitotic progression precedes apoptosis. Clearly, further experiments are necessary to define the pathways that lead to apoptosis upon inhibition of lin9.

https://openalex.org/W2092860871,"Background Protein evolution is particularly shaped by the conservation of the amino acids' physico-chemical properties and the structure of the genetic code. While conservation is the result of negative selection against proteins with reduced functionality, the codon sequences determine the stochastic aspect of amino acid exchanges. Thus far, it is known that the genetic code is the dominant factor if little time has elapsed since the divergence of one gene into two, but physico-chemical forces gain importance at greater evolutionary distances. Further details, however, on how the influence of these factors varies with time are unknown to date. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we derive each 10,000 divergence specific substitution matrices for orthologues and paralogues from the Pfam collection of multiple protein alignments and quantify the action of three physico-chemical forces and of the structure of the genetic code at high resolution using correlation analysis. For closely related proteins, the codon sequence similarity is the most influential factor controlling protein evolution, but its influence decreases rapidly as divergence grows. From a protein sequence divergence of about 20 percent on the maintenance of the hydrophobic character of an amino acid is the most influential factor. All factors lose importance from about 40 percent divergence on. This suggests that the original protein structure often does no longer represent a constraint to the protein sequence. The proteins then become free to adopt new functions. We furthermore show that the constraints exerted by both physico-chemical forces and by the genetic code are quite comparable for orthologues and paralogues, however somewhat weaker for paralogues than for orthologues in weakly or moderately diverged proteins. Conclusion/Significance Our analysis substantiates earlier findings that protein evolution is mainly governed by the structure of the genetic code in the early phase after divergence and by the conservation of physico-chemical properties at the later phase. We determine the level of sequence divergence from which on the conservation of the hydrophobic character is gaining importance over the genetic code to be 20 percent. The evolution of orthologues and paralogues is shaped by evolutionary forces in quite comparable ways."
