https://openalex.org/W1996106365,"The chemical composition of atmospheric particles collected near sea level over the North Atlantic indicates that Al, Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, Na, Mg, Ca, K, and Sr are derived from either crustal weathering or the ocean. The elements V, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Sb, and Se are present in concentrations higher than expected from these sources. Although the V is probably derived from pollution sources on the North American continent, a comparison of enrichment factors relative to average crustal material for the remainder of these elements over the North Atlantic with enrichment factors for similar samples collected at the geographic South Pole suggests that the anomalously high enrichment factors may be due to natural rather than anthropogenic sources. A vapor phase for these metals may be involved at their source."

However, the evaporation rate is so high that the available heat sources cannot melt pure ice. Liquid water is therefore limited to concentrated solutions of strongly deliquescent salts."
https://openalex.org/W2081384591,"Race 1 cultures of the phytopathogenic fungus Phytophthora megasperma var. sojae produced a specific elicitor of the soybean phytoalexin hydroxyphaseollin that resulted in higher production of the phytoalexin on disease-resistant Harosoy 63 soybeans than in the near-isogenic susceptible cultivar Harosoy. Race 3 of the fungus, which gives susceptible reactions on both soybean cultivars, did not produce the race I specific elicitor."
https://openalex.org/W2084574732,"A new type of natural pyrrhotite, orthorhombic 11C type (a = 6.892, b = 11.952, c = 5.744 x 11 angstroms), and the hexagonal 6C type (a = 6.89, c = 5.76 x 6 angstroms) are described. Their compositions are Fe(10)S(11) and Fe(11)S(12), respectively. Pyrrhotites stable in nature have essentially stoichiometric composition, Fe(n)-(l)S(n) (n>/=8), with the structures of n/2C type for n even and of nC type for n odd. The solid solutions between Fe(11)S(12) and Fe(10)S(11), and between Fe(10)S(11) and Fe(9)S(10) are considered metastable in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2069676389,"Although reactions of molecular crystals are much more widespread than has been generally appreciated (53), the great sensitivity of their rates to seemingly trivial changes in molecular structure clearly provides a major stumbling block to the general utilization of such processes. A key to understanding the effects of structural changes has been provided by the demonstration of anisotropy of such reactions discussed in this article. It is recognized, however, that many factors in addition to those aspects of the crystal structure utilized in the discussion above may play a part in determining reactivity of crystalline solids with gases. The recent ready availability of crystal structure data for molecular crystals should lead to a more rapid development of the principles governing the packing of such crystals and their reactivity. The resulting control of such reactions should not only provide the means of causing them when they are desired, as, for example, for synthesis, but also the means of preventing them when they are to be avoided, as in the stabilization of pharmaceuticals. Finally, it appears that we have only just begun to exploit the potential reaction specificity and the exciting possibilities resulting from the unique symmetry properties of the crystalline state."
https://openalex.org/W2149259666,"The (14)C activity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can be used to distinguish between the fossil organic carbon due to petrochemical effluents and modern organic carbon due to domestic wastes and natural decaying organic matter. Rivers polluted by petrochemical effluents show varying amounts of depression of the DOC (14)C activity, reflecting concentrations of (14)C-deficient fossil carbon of as much as about 40 percent of the total DOC."
https://openalex.org/W2052910501,"Samples of olivine (Fo(0)Fa(100), Fo(60)Fa(40), Fo(80)Fa(20), and Fo(100)Fa(0)) and of spinel (Fo(50)Fa(50), Fo(2)Fa(100), where Fo is forsterite and Fa is fayalite) were subjected to pressures up to 250 kilobars in a diamond anvil press and were heated in situ up to ~ 1700 degrees C by an infrared beam from a continuous-wave YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser. The brightness temperature was determined from the intensity of incandescence of the sample by means of an optical pyrometer. X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples, obtained after quenching and unloading, show conclusively that these compositions disproportionate to (Mg, Fe)O and SiO(s) (stishovite) under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2086913318,"Crude unifacial tools, choppers, and a burin have been uncovered in association with megafauna in a buried stratum that was radiocarbon dated at 12,200 B.C. in a cave in highland Peru. The tool types, megafauna, and date are significant with regard to the problem of the antiquity of man and his culture in the New World."
https://openalex.org/W2089138107,"Waters unusually rich in ammonia, boron, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons are found in more than 100 localities along the Pacific coast of the United States. The waters are believed to be products of low-grade metamorphism of marine sediments. The marine sedimentary rocks would have to be tectonically emplaced below crystalline rocks in many places. Mercury ore deposits are probably also products of the low-grade metamorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2028675108,"Earth-based observations of the lunar microwave brightness temperature spectrum at wavelengths between 5 and 500 centimeters, when reexamined in the light of physical property data derived from the Apollo program, tentatively support the high heat flows measured in situ and indicate that a regolith thickness between 10 and 30 meters may characterize a large portion of the lunar near side."
https://openalex.org/W1985073760,"Data obtained from a transcontinental tidal gravity profile across the United States were analyzed. Results for the principal tidal constituents M(2) and O(1) have shed light on the long-standing problem of the indirect influence of ocean tides on the solid-earth tide. The profile consists of nine observational stations distributed almost evenly around latitudes 39 to 41 degrees north across the United States. The observed values of the gravimetric factor and the phase were found to depend on the tidal characteristics of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. There is no observable correlation between tidal gravity parameters and the regional geology. When the influence of ocean tides is taken into account, it is possible for the first time to bring the gravimetric factors and phases for all the stations of a transcontinental network into a consistent system within the framework of the earth tidal theory."
https://openalex.org/W2034495730,Rare earth element abundances in soapstone from quarries and artifacts in eastern Virginia were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis. By comparing these abundances it was possible to trace artifactual material to the outcrops which served as the source of this material during the first millennium B.C. Certain known sociopolitical boundaries in prehistoric Virginia were inferred to be older than previously assumed.

https://openalex.org/W2054726205,"Thus, we are skeptical of the commonly stated arguments for re-creation of a science office at the White House, but are ultimately convinced that such an office is justified. A three-man CST is a reasonable proposal, although the detailed structure is less critical than the mandate given to the office, and the general understanding within government of its functions and limitations and of its relationship to the President. To give it permanence, the office should be grounded in a science policy management and oversight function that is critically needed today. That kind of strong office could lead a president to use it as his personal science advisory staff, but the decision must be made anew by each president. The President does have other ways of obtaining scientific advice, although the right kind of science office would be a preferable route in our view. The importance of such an office being able to present its analyses and recommendations in policy terms useful to other policy-makers cannot be overestimated. This has important implications for the kind of competence required to staff and work with such a council; it also requires recognition of the fact that policy-relevant studies and advice can never be value-free, even when carried out by scientists and engineers. And finally, such a council could bring intensive and continuous attention to the international dimension of U.S. science policy, which seems to us to be particularly neglected. It is not yet clear whether there will be any structural changes in the new Administration. But it is not too soon to be clearer about the essential factors that should underlie a sensible proposal for this or the next Administration."
