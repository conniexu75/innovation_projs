https://openalex.org/W2161115679,"Random high throughput sequencing of a human osteoclast cDNA library was employed to identify novel osteoclast-expressed genes. Of the 5475 ESTs obtained, approximately 4% encoded cathepsin K, a novel cysteine protease homologous to cathepsins S and L; ESTs for other cathepsins were rare. In addition, ESTs for cathepsin K were absent or at low frequency in cDNA libraries from numerous other tissues and cells. In situ hybridization in osteoclastoma and osteophyte confirmed that cathepsin K mRNA was highly expressed selectively in osteoclasts; cathepsins S, L, and B were not detectable. Cathepsin K was not detected by in situ hybridization in a panel of other tissues. Western blot of human osteoclastoma or fetal rat humerus demonstrated bands of 38 and 27 kDa, consistent with sizes predicted for pro- and mature cathepsin K. Immunolocalization in osteoclastoma and osteophyte showed intense punctate staining of cathepsin K exclusively in osteoclasts, with a polar distribution that was more intense at the bone surface. The abundant expression of cathepsin K selectively in osteoclasts strongly suggests that it plays a specialized role in bone resorption. Furthermore, the data suggest that random sequencing of ESTs from cDNA libraries is a valuable approach for identifying novel cell-selective genes.

INTRODUCTIONBone is composed of a protein matrix in which spindle- or plate-shaped crystals of hydroxyapatite are incorporated(1.Baron R. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. Raven Press, New York1993: 3-9Google Scholar). The matrix is approximately 90% Type I collagen, but also contains a number of non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein. It has been recognized for many years that bone resorption requires both dissolution of the inorganic mineral component (acidic microenvironment) and degradation of the protein matrix (protease activity). This has led to extensive efforts to identify the protease(s) responsible for osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. However, since osteoclasts are very rare cells and no appropriate osteoclast cell model has been identified, standard biochemical approaches for identification of the protease(s) have proven to be very difficult.A number of studies have suggested that a cysteine protease(s) is involved in bone resorption. For example, several known cathepsins have collagenolytic activity under acidic conditions(2.Maciewicz R.A. Etherington D.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a property that is predicted to be required for the enzyme(s) secreted from the osteoclast into the acidic resorption lacunae. In addition, classical inhibitors of cysteine proteases, such as leupeptin, Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2, E-64, and cystatin, have demonstrated activity at preventing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in in vitro models(3.Delaisse J.-M.

Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 and leupeptin have also shown activity in vivo in a murine hypercalcemia model of bone resorption(4.Delaisse J.-M. Eeckhout Y. Vaes G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Based upon observed substrate and inhibitor preferences, as well as immunological reactivity, several groups have suggested that cathepsins B or L, or a closely related enzyme, are likely to be responsible for osteoclast-mediated resorption (9.Delaisse J.-M.

This novel cathepsin has been referred to as OC2 (22.Tezuka K. Tezuka Y. Maejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); we refer to it as cathepsin K. ( (1)The Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has assigned the name cathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38) to the protease described in this paper.) The approach that we used to identify cathepsin K was to partially sequence large numbers of randomly chosen clones from an osteoclast cDNA library(25.Drake F. James I. Connor J. Rieman D. Dodds R. McCabe F. Bertolini D. Barthlow R. Hastings G. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: S177Google Scholar). By comparing homology to known sequences, the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) ( (2)The abbreviations used are: ESTexpressed sequence tagTESPA3-aminopropyltriethoxy silanePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) obtained from this technique provide a valuable approach for identification of novel expressed genes(28.Adams M.D. Kelley J.M.

In addition, specific anti-cathepsin K antibodies were generated and used to demonstrate expression and cellular localization of cathepsin K protein. The data clearly show that cathepsin K is abundantly and selectively expressed in osteoclasts, and that it displays a cellular localization consistent with an involvement of the enzyme in bone resorption. Furthermore, the data indicate that cathepsins S, B, and L, which had been proposed to be involved in bone resorption, are either expressed at very low levels or are absent in osteoclasts.MATERIALS AND METHODSOsteoclast cDNA LibraryFresh osteoclastoma tissue was chopped into small pieces and placed into a sterile 50-ml centrifuge tube. The pieces were disaggregated by incubating at 37°C for 30 min in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 3 mg/ml (w/v) type I collagenase (Sigma). A cell suspension was obtained by gently homogenizing the remaining tissue with a plunger from a 30-ml syringe. The osteoclastoma-derived cells were pelleted by centrifugation (400 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 6 ml of cold culture medium (RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin; Life Technologies, Inc.) to which was added 3 ml of the anti-β3 antibody, C22. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the cells were washed twice by centrifugation in cold RPMI medium. After the last wash, the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of medium and were enumerated in a hemocytometer. Dynabeads (Dynal Inc., Great Neck, NY). coated with goat anti-mouse IgG were incubated for 30 min on ice with the cell suspension at a density of 6 beads/osteoclast. The bead-coated osteoclasts were immobilized on a magnet, and the uncoated cells were removed by extensive washing with cold RPMI medium. The osteoclast-rich suspension was then resuspended in fresh RPMI medium and seeded into eight T250 tissue culture flasks. The cells were cultured for 3 days prior to the extraction of mRNA using the Invitrogen FastTrack mRNA Isolation kit. The mRNA was methylmercuric hydroxide denatured prior to cDNA synthesis, and a directional oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was prepared (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cDNA was size fractionated, and fragments greater than 1 kilobase were ligated into the Uni-ZAP XR vector.In Situ HybridizationCryostat sections of osteophytes and osteoclastoma tissue were processed as described previously(31.Dodds R.A. Gowen M. Bradbeer J.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sections were picked off onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (TESPA)-coated glass slides. A cDNA clone (pBluescript SK) containing the coding region of human cathepsin K was obtained from the osteoclast library. Clones for cathepsins B, S, and L were obtained from stromal cell, pancreatic tumor, and human embryo cDNA libraries, respectively. cDNA templates were linearized and then transcribed from the T3 or the T7 promoter to generate sense and antisense probes, respectively. Riboprobes were prepared using the Promega (Madison, WI) In Vitro transcription kit with [35S]thio-CTP (Amersham Corp.). Following transcription, cDNA templates were digested with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through Quick Spin Sephadex G-50 columns (Boehringer Mannheim). RNA transcripts with a specific activity in excess of 108 cpm/mg were used for hybridization.In situ hybridization was performed by a modification of the method of Zeller and Rogers(32.Zeller R. Rogers M. Jansen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991: 14.3.1-14.3.11Google Scholar), as follows. Cryosections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed, dehydrated, and frozen at −20°C. Prior to hybridization sections were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mg/ml glycine and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. Demineralization was in 0.2 N HCl for 20 min, followed by acetylation in 0.25% acetic anhydride, 0.1 M triethanolamine. Finally, sections were washed twice in 2 × SSC (20 × SSC: 3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), dehydrated in 30, 60, 80, 95, and 100% ethanol, and air-dried. Sections were used immediately for hybridization in buffer consisting of 2 parts hybridization mix B (1.2 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mM EDTA, 2 × Denhardt's solution, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 200 μg/ml poly(A)) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 2 parts deionized formamide, and 1 part 50% dextran sulfate. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 50 mM, and probe concentration was 2 × 105 cpm/μl. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 4 h in a well sealed moist chamber. Post-hybridization washes were as follows: at least twice in prewarmed 2 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at 50°C; once in 20 μg/ml boiled ribonuclease A in 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 37°C; at least twice in prewarmed 2 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at 50°C; twice in prewarmed 0.1 × SSC, 1%β-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at 50°C. Sections were dehydrated in the following: 0.6 M NaCl, 30% ethanol; 0.6 M NaCl, 60% ethanol; 80%, 95%, and 100% ethanol for 2 min each. Air-dried slides were coated in Amersham LM-1 emulsion and exposed at 4°C for 2 weeks. The slides were developed in a Kodak developer and counterstained with methylene blue. The extent of the hybridization signal was assessed by the autoradiographic grain density over the cell.AntibodiesFor anti-peptide antibodies, rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a sequence in cathepsin K that has low sequence identity to other known cathepsins. Antibody C2 was generated to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 248-260 of preprocathepsin K (AIDASLTSFQFYS). The antibody was affinity-purified by chromatography on immobilized peptide antigen. For anti-protein antibodies (SR-1), a rabbit was immunized with full-length preprocathepsin K that had been overproduced in Escherichia coli, and purified by preparative SDS-PAGE.Western BlotExtracts of osteoclastoma were prepared by rapid lysis in hot (60°C) 2% SDS. Fetal rat humerus was Dounce homogenized, followed by lysis in hot 2% SDS. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with anti-cathepsin K antisera (or affinity-purified antibodies), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase.ImmunocytochemistryCurettage samples of osteoclastoma tissue were fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin (Baxter Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL) and then washed in 70% ethanol. The tissue was processed for paraffin embedding using a Shandon Citadel 1000 tissue processor, and embedded in paraffin wax using a Shandon embedding center (Pittsburgh, PA). The tissue blocks were cut, using a Reichert Histostat rotary microtome (Warner Lambert Instruments, Buffalo, NY), and the 7-μm sections were placed onto TESPA-coated glass slides. The sections were dried overnight at 37°C and were then dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated into 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0). The sections were then boiled for 15-30 min in the citrate buffer by microwaving them at high power in a household microwave oven (General Electric, Louisville, KY); the buffer was periodically topped up to prevent the tissue from drying out. After cooling slides to room temperature, the sections were overlaid with either the rabbit polyclonal cathepsin-K reactive primary antibodies, or with nonimmune serum controls, and a standard avidin/biotin alkaline phosphatase method was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (DAKO, Carpenteria, CA). Positive reactivity was detected using a post-coupling naphthol phosphate method with Fast Red-TR (Sigma) as the coupler; a red precipitate indicated positive reactivity.Alternatively, cryostat sections were used to demonstrate the reactivity of the anti-cathepsin K antibodies. Sections (8 μm) of human tissues were cut using a Bright's cryostat (Bright Instrument Co., Huntingdon, United Kingdom) equipped with a tungsten-tipped steel knife (ARP, Cheshire, United Kingdom). The sections (undecalcified adult osteophytic bone and rheumatoid synovium from osteoarthritic and rheumatoid femoral heads, respectively; post-mortem specimens of human kidney, spleen, liver, lung, heart, skin, and colon) were placed onto TESPA-coated slides and air-dried for at least 15 min. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min and then washed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) immediately before boiling them in the citrate buffer for 15 min in the microwave. The remainder of the technique was performed as outlined above.RESULTSCathepsin EST FrequencyCathepsin K was identified as a novel cysteine protease whose ESTs were highly abundant in an osteoclast library from human osteoclastoma(25.Drake F. James I. Connor J. Rieman D. Dodds R. McCabe F. Bertolini D. Barthlow R. Hastings G. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: S177Google Scholar). Approximately 4% of all ESTs randomly sequenced from this library encoded cathepsin K (223 ESTs of 5475 total). In contrast, ESTs for cathepsin K were absent in most other libraries sequenced. For cDNA libraries in which ESTs for cathepsin K were found, they were present at much lower frequency than in the osteoclast cDNA library. For example, in cDNA libraries for which greater than 1000 ESTs had been sequenced, the frequency of ESTs for cathepsin K was: placenta, 0.0016%; white adipose, 0.06%; retina, 0.06%; colon, 0.037%; epididymus, 0.09%; gall bladder, 0.03%; testes, 0.006%; tonsils, 0.009%; chondrosarcoma, 0.13%; ovarian cancer, 0.018%; B cell lymphoma, 0.015%; pancreatic tumor, 0.017%; prostate cancer, 0.087%, T-cell lymphoma, 0.036%; and activated monocytes, 0.044%. Thus, data from a number of libraries suggest that cathepsin K is abundant only in osteoclasts.In contrast to the abundance of ESTs for cathepsin K, ESTs for other cathepsins were rare in the osteoclast library. Only two ESTs (0.036%) for cathepsin B were identified from the osteoclast library, and one EST (0.018%) for cathepsin S was found. No ESTs for cathepsin L were found, and no other ESTs for cysteine proteases were represented in the library. Thus, ESTs for cathepsin K represented greater than 98% of the total cysteine protease ESTs in the human osteoclast cDNA library.Expression of Cathepsin K mRNANorthern blot analysis of osteoclastoma tissue with a specific probe for cathepsin K demonstrated a single band of approximately 2 kilobases (data not shown). To determine which cells expressed the enzyme, in situ hybridization studies were performed in human osteoclastoma and osteophyte. Cathepsin K was abundantly and selectively expressed in osteoclasts and a discrete population of mononuclear cells within human osteophyte and osteoclastoma tissue (Fig. 1, A and D). All other cell types, including stromal cells (of the osteoclastoma), marrow cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and chondrocytes, were negative. At sites of cartilage remodeling in the osteophyte, chondroclasts also expressed cathepsin K mRNA (not shown).To determine the expression of cathepsin K in other cell types, a panel of human tissues was tested by in situ hybridization. Cathepsin K mRNA was not detected in any of the tissues tested (Table 1).Tabled 1Expression of mRNA for Cathepsins S, L, and BThe EST frequency suggested that cathepsins S, L, and B were expressed at a much lower frequency in osteoclasts than cathepsin K. To confirm this, in situ hybridization studies were performed on osteoclastoma and osteophyte sections with probes specific for these cathepsins. No hybridization was detected in osteoclasts in osteoclastoma or osteophyte with probes for cathepsins S, L, or B (cathepsin B shown as representative; Fig. 1, C and F; Table 2). As expected, cathepsins B and L were highly expressed in spleen, liver, and kidney (Table 2).Tabled 1Expression of Cathepsin K ProteinWestern blot analysis of osteoclastoma tissue with antibody against either synthetic peptides unique to cathepsin K (antibody C2) or to intact procathepsin K that had been expressed in E. coli (antibody SR1) demonstrated immunoreactive bands of 38 kDa and 27 kDa (Fig. 3, lane A), consistent with the predicted size of the pro- and mature cathepsin K, respectively. For the antipeptide antibody, addition of an excess of the peptide immunogen prevented the detection of these bands (Fig. 3, lane B); an excess of an unrelated peptide had no effect (data not shown). To determine if cathepsin K was expressed in normal tissue, fetal rat humerus was analyzed by Western blot, and a similar pattern of expression was observed (data not shown).Figure 3:Cathepsin K protein expression in osteoclastoma. Human osteoclastoma lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide from a unique region of the predicted amino acid sequence of human cathepsin K (antibody C-2). In lane A, immunoreactive bands of 38 and 27 kDa are observed. Lane B demonstrates that these immunoreactive bands can be competed with 3 μg/ml peptide antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunolocalization of cathepsin K using antibody SR1 in osteoclastoma tissue demonstrated abundant staining in osteoclasts and showed a punctate, granular distribution that was very often localized to a single pole of the osteoclasts (Fig. 2A, large arrowheads). A small population of mononuclear cells (potentially representing an osteoclast precursor population) also demonstrated reactivity (Fig. 2A, small arrowheads). Surrounding stromal cells were negative for cathepsin K. Immunolocalization with antibody C2 demonstrated similar results (data not shown). No staining could be detected in any cells on the nonimmune serum control slides (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Immunolocalization of cathepsin K. Sections were probed with the antisera indicated, followed by labeled streptavidin-biotin and staining with Mayer's hematoxylin. A, osteoclasts (large arrowheads) and a minor population of mononuclear cells (small arrowheads) in osteoclastoma demonstrated strong staining with anti-cathepsin K antibody (SR1). In many of the multinucleated osteoclasts, the staining was polarized to one edge of the cytoplasm (asterisks). Original magnification, × 20. B, no reactivity was detected in a section of osteoclastoma probed with pre-immune serum. Original magnification, × 20. C, strong anti-cathepsin K antibody (SR1) staining was detected on osteoclasts apposed (large arrowheads) to and away from (arrowheads) the bone surface in a section human osteophytic bone.

The osteoclasts showed a distinct polarity of staining that was more intense toward the apical surface of resorbing osteoclasts. Cathepsin K expression also appeared to be restricted to osteoclasts, since other bone marrow cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and connective tissue cells did not demonstrate reactivity (Fig. 2, C and D; Table 1).In contrast to the immunoreactivity observed in osteoclasts, cathepsin K protein expression was not detected in the panel of other human tissues analyzed (Table 1).DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have consistently demonstrated that inhibitors of cysteine proteases are very effective at preventing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and have clearly implicated a cathepsin(s) as a key mediator of this process(3.Delaisse J.-M.

INTRODUCTIONMany theories of aging are based on the hypothesis that aging is caused by oxidative damage as well as other macromolecular modifications that lead to the accumulation of random intracellular molecular defects(1.Holliday R.

Recent studies have supported this idea by demonstrating a correlation between increased superoxide dismutase activity, increased life-span, and decreased oxidative damage in fruit flies and nematodes(5.Agarwal S. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12332-12335Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 6.Larsen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We report here the development of a new in vivo model system for the role of oxidative stress in aging based on the stationary phase of the simple eucaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae.A large number of in vitro studies strongly implicate the respiratory chain (8.Boveris A.

Academic Press, New York1982: 65-90Crossref Google Scholar) as a significant source of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in eucaryotic systems(8.Boveris A. Cadenas E. Oberley L.W. Superoxide Dismutases. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 15-30Google Scholar, 11.Blum J. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem.

However, model systems to investigate this issue in vivo have been lacking. The relative importance of the various known reactive oxygen species under various conditions is also often uncertain; hydroxyl radical produced from metal-catalyzed reactions of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide is frequently invoked. Recently, however, it has become abundantly clear that superoxide in some instances can have an important toxicity of its own (13.Fridovich I. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 247: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 14.Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15.Gardner P.R. Fridovich I.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that levels occurring naturally in vivo are high enough to cause damage. Hydrogen peroxide has long been known to be toxic, but the extent to which it is a naturally occurring toxin under normal conditions has also been difficult to evaluate.S. cerevisiae, like most other eucaryotes, contains CuZnSOD ( (1)The abbreviations used are: CuZnSODcopper-zinc superoxide dismutaseMnSODmanganese superoxide dismutaseSODsuperoxide dismutase.) (product of the SOD1 gene) in the cytosol and MnSOD (product of the SOD2 gene) in the mitochondria (reviewed in (14.Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). These enzymes catalyze the disproportionation of O⨪2, producing O2 and H2O2. Together with small molecule antioxidants, such as glutathione and ascorbate; other antioxidant enzymes, such as catalases and peroxidases; and metal chelating proteins, such as metallothionein, they allow aerobes to survive under O2, presumably by minimizing oxidative damage(14.Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).The importance of cytoplasmic SOD is demonstrated by the high sensitivity to dioxygen shown by S. cerevisiae and Escherichia coli devoid of SOD. In both organisms, the loss of SOD activity is associated with slow growth in aerobic conditions, with higher mutation rates(17.Farr S.B. D'Ari R. Touati D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8268-8272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 18.Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and with specific biosynthetic defects. (sod1− yeast require lysine and methionine for aerobic growth(19.Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas sod−E. coli require branched chain amino acids(20.Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21.Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar)). In some cases these effects are known to be due to the inhibitory effect of superoxide on iron sulfur cluster proteins (16.Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Kuo C.F. Mashino T. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4724-4727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sod2− mutants of S. cerevisiae are little affected when grown in air with glucose as the carbon source. However, they are highly sensitive to hyperoxia and grow poorly in normoxia in carbon sources that require respiration for their metabolism.The full growth cycle of a yeast culture begins with log phase and progresses through the diauxic shift to true stationary phase. In log phase, the cells use glucose to make energy via glycolysis. The diauxic shift occurs when nutrients become limited and energy metabolism shifts to respiration, at which point mitochondrial proteins are synthesized, growth rate slows, and cells utilize ethanol and other two and three carbon compounds for energy. During this phase, glycogen and trehalose are synthesized and stored, and the cells become much more resistant to stress. In the total absence of any nutrients, yeast cells enter true stationary phase. No cell division occurs; the metabolic rate slows; and cells can survive for weeks to months. Many markers, such as increased heat shock resistance and glycogen accumulation, have been utilized to define stationary phase in yeast, although it appears that the best definition of stationary phase is the ability to survive for prolonged periods without added nutrients(23.Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Stationary phase yeast resemble most of the cells of multicellular organisms in two important aspects: 1) most energy comes from mitochondrial respiration and 2) the cells have exited from the cell cycle, i.e., have entered the G0 phase. In addition, damage accumulates over time in stationary phase. This damage cannot be diluted, because cell division and new synthesis are not occurring, and thus must be prevented or repaired.Almost all published studies of yeast cells have been performed on actively growing cultures with ample nutrients and a fermentable carbon source (glucose), in spite of the fact that these conditions are relatively rare in nature and, when they do occur, do not persist indefinitely. In such log phase fermentative growth, the cells depend more heavily on glycolysis than respiration for energy and growth, and each individual cell is exposed to oxidative stress for a short period of time before it divides, allowing dilution of any accumulated damage.We report here the results of an investigation of the roles of the antioxidant enzymes in stationary phase survival in yeast. We have found that both CuZnSOD and MnSOD play a major role in cell survival, whereas catalase T and metallothionein have little effect. In addition, studies of short term survival of respiration-deficient strains indicate that both SODs play an important role in protection against the toxic products formed during mitochondrial respiration.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast StrainsStrains used are described in Table 1. The sod1− and sod2− single and double null mutants were made as described previously(18.Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Liu X.F.

Respiration-incompetent (petite) strains were made by one-step deletion replacement (25.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) of essential respiratory components in EG103 or W303B (26.Rothstein R.J. Sherman F. Genetics. 1980; 94: 871-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) wild type hosts. The petite strains in this study were generously provided by Dr. Catherine Clarke at UCLA (27.Clarke C.F. Williams W.

To make petite sod1− null mutants, the petite mutation was introduced first, followed by the sod1− mutation. ( (3)M. Babajanian, unpublished data.) The catalase T deletion strain EG223 was made using the same method with ctt1::TRP1 deletion plasmid constructed by Masis Babajanian. ( (2)J. R. Schultz, and C. F. Clarke, unpublished data.) Strains DTY3 and DTY4 (wild type parental and cup1−, respectively) were kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Thiele(29.Thiele D.J. Walling M.J. Hamer D.H. Science. 1986; 231: 854-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30.Thiele D.J. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmids used were the following: YEP351, a high copy yeast/E. coli shuttle vector carrying the LEU2 selectable marker(31.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar); YEP600, a derivitive of YEP351 carrying the yeast CuZnSOD gene and promoter region(32.Nishida C.R. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); and YEPhWT carrying the human CuZnSOD gene with the yeast SOD promoter region(33.Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S. Wong P. Lee M. Hahn H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). SOD and catalase assays were performed for all strains (see below); levels of these enzymes were shown to be normal unless the gene had been deleted.Tabled 1Medium and Growth ConditionsUnless stated otherwise, all experiments in liquid medium were performed in synthetic medium (SC) with 2% glucose and supplemented with amino acids, adenine and uracil, as described (34.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 207-210Google Scholar) as well as a 4-fold excess of the supplements Trp, Leu, Ura, and His(18.Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments in nonfermentable carbon sources, either 2% lactate or 2% ethanol was substituted for the glucose. For normal oxygen (high aeration) conditions, overnight cultures were grown in selective medium and inoculated at an OD600 of 0.01 into flasks with a flask volume/medium volume ratio of 5:1 and grown at 30°C, shaking at 220 rpm. For long term stationary phase cultures, after 48 h, the cells were washed twice and then resuspended in sterile distilled water, and incubation with shaking was continued. For low oxygen (low aeration) conditions cells were inoculated into 3 ml of medium in 16 × 100-mm tubes and shaken at 220 rpm, and, for stationary phase experiments, cells were switched to water after 120 h of growth. Growth was followed by monitoring the turbidity at 600 nm (OD600). Cell viability was measured by plating serial dilutions of the yeast cultures on YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% agar). Plates from cell lines lacking CuZnSOD were incubated in a low oxygen atmosphere generated using CampyPaks (BBL Scientific).Enzyme ActivitiesCrude extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis as follows. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with an equal volume of acid washed 0.5-mm glass beads and vortexed for 6-8 cycles of 30 s of vortexing followed by 30 s of cooling. The mixture was then microfuged for 2 min to remove the cellular debris and glass beads. The catalase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the disappearance of hydrogen peroxide at 240 nm(35.Luck H. Bergmeyer H.V. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie Press, Berlin1965: 885-894Crossref Google Scholar). SOD activity was determined by monitoring inhibition of the autoxidation of 6-hydroxydopamine(36.Heikkila R.E. Cabbat F. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37.Heikkila R.E. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 233-235Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as protein standard.Oxygen ConsumptionCellular oxygen uptake was measured at 30°C in a 4-ml stirred chamber using a YSI MODEL 53 Biological Oxygen Monitor (Yellow Springs Instruments) following the manufacturer's directions. Cells were cultured as described above, except they were inoculated at an initial OD600 of 0.1. At 12 and 24 h, aliquots were removed and tested for oxygen consumption, while maintaining conditions that resembled the flask environment (30°C and stirring).RESULTSYeast Strains Lacking CuZnSOD and/or MnSOD Are Respiration-competent but Oxygen-sensitiveGrowth curves were performed in SC medium with various carbon sources using yeast strains EG103 (wt), EG110 (sod2−), EG118 (sod1−), and EG133 (sod1−, sod2−). Under normal conditions, i.e., with glucose as the carbon source and high aeration (normoxia), sod1− yeast strains grew more slowly and reached a maximum density lower than that of wild type; strains lacking MnSOD grew as well as wild type. The strain lacking both SODs showed the same phenotype as the sod1− mutant (Fig. 1A).Figure 1:Aerobic growth deficiencies of SOD null mutants in glucose and nonfermentable carbon sources. Cells were grown in SC medium with the indicated carbon source. A, 2% glucose, OD600 was measured at the indicated times. Cells were grown shaking in flasks to achieve normal aeration (normoxia) as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, cells were grown in 2% lactate or 2% ethanol as indicated. For normal aeration flasks were inoculated in flasks at an initial OD600 of 0.01. For low aeration, tubes were inoculated at an initial OD600 of 0.1. The data shown were taken at 90 h for the normal aeration experiment and at 82 h for low aeration. The data shown are representative; the experiment was repeated three times. W.T., wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The same strains were grown in SC with either ethanol or lactate as the carbon source under conditions of either high or low aeration (Fig. 1B). With low aeration, all three mutant strains grew nearly as well as wild type in lactate and were able to grow, but less well, in ethanol. These results indicate that the strains are able to respire and therefore that they must contain functional mitochondria; thus they are potentially competent to enter stationary phase. Under high aeration in ethanol, the mutant strains showed much reduced growth, and the double mutant was unable to grow at all. In lactate, under high aeration, the sod2− mutant also did poorly, and the double mutant did not grow at all; but, somewhat surprisingly, the sod1− strain grew nearly as well as wild type. When growth in air on rich medium plates (YPD or YPE) was tested, results similar to the high aeration liquid culture data were obtained (data not shown). The absence of cytoplasmic catalase or of metallothionein (CUP1) did not affect growth under any of these conditions (data not shown).CuZnSOD Null Mutants Rapidly Lose Viability under Normal Oxygen in Stationary PhaseTo determine the effect of SOD mutations on cell growth and on the transition to stationary phase, the same four yeast strains, EG103 (wt), EG110 (sod2−), EG118 (sod1−), and EG133 (sod1−, sod2−) plus EG223 (ctt1−) and DTY4 (cup1−) with its parental control (DTY3), were grown under conditions of high aeration (normoxia) for 48 h and then were washed and resuspended in water, as described under “Materials and Methods.” (This treatment results in the longest survival for wild type yeast strains.) The viability of the cells was then determined as a function of time (Fig. 2). The wild type strain maintained viability of greater than 40% for over 30 days, whereas the SOD mutants died much sooner. The strain lacking both SODs survived only for a few days, having less than 0.01% viable cells by day 5. The single sod1− mutant was less than 0.1% viable by day 9, whereas the sod2− mutants survived as well as wild type for 5-9 days and then began dropping off, reaching less than 1% viability at day 15. The lack of the cytoplasmic catalase T in strain EG223 had a small effect on viability, in spite of the fact that cytoplasmic catalase is highly induced in stationary phase. This lack of effect was somewhat surprising, because hydrogen peroxide, which is uncharged and easily crosses biological membranes, is a likely candidate for escape from the mitochondria. Other enzymes for handling peroxides (catalase A, cytochrome c peroxidase, etc.) whose genes are still present in these cell lines may account for this protection. A leak of the charged superoxide ion seems less likely, but this evidence raises the possibility that it occurs or that superoxide is generated on both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The cup1− mutation had no effect on survival under these conditions (data not shown).Figure 2:Long term survival of sod− and ctt1− mutants in normal aeration (normoxia). Cells were allowed to grow in flasks for 48 h and then washed three times in water and reincubated in water. Viability was monitored at the indicated days by plating onto YPD plates and counting the colonies formed. Experiments were repeated five times with similar results. A representative experiment is shown. ▪, EG103 (wt); □, EG223 (ctt1−); •, EG110 (sod2−); ▴, EG118 (sod1−); ◊, EG133 (sod1−, sod2−).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparison between the survival rates of the sod1− and sod2− mutants (Fig. 2) indicates that there is some cross-talk between the two compartments despite the fact that the two SODs have different subcellular locations. The fact that the EG110 (sod2−) strain survives as well as wild type in the early stages of this experiment indicates that the cytoplasmic CuZnSOD can at least temporarily compensate for the loss of the mitochondrial MnSOD. Nevertheless, the fact that MnSOD does itself have an important role to play is apparent from the very poor survival of EG133 (sod1−, sod2−) after a few days relative to EG118 (sod1−).Cells were incubated in medium containing excess amounts of lysine and methionine in order to eliminate the possibility that these known auxotrophies might be responsible for the early loss of viability seen in the sod1− null mutants. A 3-fold excess of these amino acids did not reverse the viability loss (data not shown).Expression of Human or Yeast CuZnSOD Reverses the Viability Defects of sod1− Null MutantsTo be certain that the loss of viability seen was SOD1-related, strains EG118 (sod1−) and EG133 (sod1−, sod2−) were transformed with plasmid YEP351 (control), plasmid YEP600 (carrying the yeast SOD1 gene), or plasmid YEPhWT (carrying the human SOD1 gene), and the survival studies were repeated (Fig. 3). In each case, transformation with the vector did not substantially alter the long term survival of the strain, whereas the overexpression of the wild type CuZnSOD restored the strain to the behavior expected for the strain with the wild type SOD1 gene. In other words, EG118/YEP600 (or YEPhWT) behaved like EG103, and EG133/YEP600 behaved like EG110, indicating that the lack of the SOD1 gene was causing the observed effects. Transformation with control plasmid YEP351 slightly improved long term survival (compare Fig. 1 and 3), possibly due to the leucine prototrophy allowed by the presence in the plasmid of the LEU2 gene. However, supplementation of the nontransformed cultures with extra leucine did not reverse the viability defect observed for EG118 and EG133 (data not shown). An alternative possibility is that the transformation procedure causes selection of slightly hardier strains.Figure 3:Transformation with wild type yeast or human CuZnSOD gene restored wild type survival to sod1− and sod1−2− yeast strains. Incubations were performed as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. Strains were transformed with either the control plasmid (YEP351) or the same plasmid carrying either the yeast or the human CuZnSOD gene. ▪, EG103 (wt) with YEP351; □, EG118 (sod1−) with YEP351; □, EG118 (sod1−) with human wild type SOD1 gene; ▴ EG118 (sod1−) with yeast wild type SOD1 gene; ×, EG133 (sod1−, sod2−) with YEP351; ○, EG133 with yeast wild type SOD1 gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Low Oxygen Conditions Decrease the Importance of CuZnSOD for Stationary Phase Survival; MnSOD Remains ImportantAn alternate experimental method involved incubation of cells in 3 ml of medium in 16-mm culture tubes shaking at the same rate (220 rpm). Because of the lower surface-to-volume ratio and because the cells tended to collect at the bottom of the tubes, the level of aeration was much lower. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4. When incubated under these conditions of low oxygen, the sod1− mutant retained viability for 15-30 days, whereas the sod2− mutant and the double sod1−, sod2− mutant lost viability, dropping to 10 and 1% viable, respectively, by day 15. We conclude that the inability of CuZnSOD null mutants to retain viability for more than 48 h in normoxia is caused by oxygen toxicity. This result also implies that MnSOD is better able to prevent the migration of toxic reactive oxygen species from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm under lower oxygen conditions.Figure 4:Long term survival of sod− mutants in low aeration (hypoxia). Cells were allowed to grow in SC medium with glucose in tubes for 5 days and were then washed three times in water and reincubated in water.

We predicted that if the same was true in vivo, then respiration-incompetent sod− strains would perform better than their respiration-competent isogenic relatives. In order to examine this question, we obtained or constructed strains carrying a deletion in coq3(27.Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in sod1 or in sod1 and sod2. COQ3 is the gene for one of the enzymes required for synthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ or ubiquinone); coq3− strains are unable to synthesize CoQ and are thus respiration-incompetent or petite(27.Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured oxygen consumption to verify that respiration was lacking. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Both EG118 (sod1−) and EG133 (sod1−, sod2−) with wild type COQ3 showed high oxygen consumption, whereas the coq3− versions of each strain demonstrated drastically reduced consumption of oxygen.Figure 5:Oxygen uptake by sod− strains with and without coq3− deletions. Oxygen consumption was measured on aliquots of cells taken from cultures grown in high aeration conditions at 12 h of incubation (late log phase). Similar results were obtained at 24 h of incubation and in early log phase (data not shown).

In fact, the viability of coq3−SOD1+ cells dropped to 10% by day 6 of incubation (data not shown). However, survival in early stages of culture is instructive and can be examined readily. The results of such experiments are shown in Fig. 6.

H., Dodds, R., James, I., Connor, J., Debouck, C., Richardson, S., Lee, E., Rieman, D., Barthlow, R., Hastings, G., and Gowen, M.(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12511-12516). To characterize its catalytic properties, cathepsin K has been expressed in baculovirus-infected SF21 cells and the soluble recombinant protein isolated from growth media was purified. Purified protein includes an inhibitory pro-leader sequence common to this family of protease. Conditions for enzyme activation upon removal of the pro-sequence have been identified. Fluorogenic peptides have been identified as substrates for mature cathepsin K. In addition, two protein components of bone matrix, collagen and osteonectin, have been shown to be substrates of the activated protease. Cathepsin K is inhibited by E-64 and leupeptin, but not by pepstatin, EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, or phenanthroline, consistent with its classification within the cysteine protease class. Leupeptin has been characterized as a slow binding inhibitor of cathepsin K (kobs/[I] = 273,000 M–1•s–1). Cathepsin K may represent the elusive protease implicated in degradation of protein matrix during bone resorption and represents a novel molecular target in treatment of disease states associated with excessive bone loss such as osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2038655486,"In earlier studies the DNA site required for sterol regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase was shown to be distinct from the classic sterol regulatory element (SRE-1) of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (Osborne, T. F. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13947-13951). However, oxysterol-resistant cells that continuously overproduce one of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins in the nucleus result in high unregulated expression of both genes (Yang, J., Brown, M. S., Ho, Y. K., and Goldstein, J. L.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 12152-12161) suggesting a direct role for the SREBPs in the activation of the reductase gene. In the present studies we demonstrate that SREBP-1 binds to two adjacent sites within the previously identified sterol regulatory element of the reductase gene even though there is only limited homology with the SRE-1 of the receptor. We also show that SREBP-1 specifically activates the reductase promoter in transient DNA transfection studies in HepG2 cells and that mutations which eliminate sterol regulation and SREBP-1 binding also abolish transient activation by SREBP-1. Although specific, the magnitude of the activation observed is considerably lower than for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor analyzed in parallel, suggesting there is an additional protein required for activation of the reductase promoter that is limiting in the transient assay. SREBP also binds to two additional sites in the reductase promoter which probably play an auxiliary role in expression. When the DNA sequence within the sites are aligned with each other and with the LDL receptor SRE-1, a consensus half-site is revealed 5′-PyCAPy-3′. The LDL receptor element contains two half-sites oriented as a direct repeat spaced by one nucleotide.The SREBP proteins are special members of the basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLHZip) family of DNA binding proteins since they bind the classic palindromic E-box site as well as the direct repeat SRE-1 element. The SREBP binding sites in both the reductase and those recently identified in other sterol regulated promoters appear to contain a half-site with considerable divergence in the flanking residues. Here we also show that a 22-amino acid domain located immediately adjacent to the basic domain of the bHLHZip region is required for SREBP to efficiently recognize divergent sites in the reductase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase promoters but, interestingly, this domain is not required for efficient binding to the LDL direct repeat SRE-1 or to a palindromic high-affinity E-box element. In earlier studies the DNA site required for sterol regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase was shown to be distinct from the classic sterol regulatory element (SRE-1) of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (Osborne, T.

Balanced cholesterol metabolism in mammalian cells is maintained through the feedback regulation of key proteins involved in its cellular uptake and biosynthesis. A major control point is at the level of transcription for genes that encode important proteins of both processes(1.Goldstein J. Brown M. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar, 2.Osborne T.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1995; 5: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

The original studies identified a sequence similarity in the target site for cholesterol regulation (called the SRE-1) in the promoter for the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase(3.Sudhof T. Van der Westhuyzen D. Goldstein J. Brown M. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gil G. J.

Further studies demonstrated that the SRE-1 of the LDL receptor is a 10-base pair site that binds a specific subfamily of basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLHZip) DNA binding proteins called the sterol regulatory element binding proteins or SREBP's(6.Briggs M.R.

When mammalian cells are starved for cholesterol the SREBP proteins are cleaved from the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope by proteolysis and the soluble amino-terminal fragment containing the DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions is translocated to the nucleus where it activates expression of appropriate target genes. The first evidence for this maturation process came from classic pulse-chase and gel electrophoresis studies on cells that were cultured in the presence and absence of sterols(9.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 and −2 proteins were regulated in an identical fashion in tissue culture cells(9.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). However, a recent study in animals has suggested that the two SREBPs are regulated independently by cholesterol deprivation in the liver(10.Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the two proteins have a similar domain structure, bind to the same DNA target sites in vitro, and appear to activate the same target genes when overexpressed in transfection studies(8.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar, 11.Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fundamental role for SREBP processing in cholesterol regulation was uncovered when SREBP expression was analyzed in mutant cell lines that were selected for resistance to the toxic effects of oxysterols(11.Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13.Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several independently derived oxysterol-resistant cell lines all resulted from genomic rearrangements that lead to production of an altered form of the SREBP-2 protein. All variant proteins lack the membrane spanning domains which are responsible for localizing the precursor to the endoplasmic reticulum in a hairpin configuration(12.Sato R. Yang J. Wang X.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, SREBP-2 is constitutively targeted to the nucleus resulting in high expression of the LDL receptor and cholesterol synthetic enzymes independent of the cholesterol content of the culture medium. We have shown previously that the DNA target site for cholesterol regulation of HMG-CoA reductase appeared to be distinct from the direct repeat SRE-1 recognition site for SREBP in the LDL receptor (15.Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the palindromic E-box that is the characteristic recognition site of bHLH proteins and was identified for SREBP-1 in a previous study(16.Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, we have purified a protein that binds to the reductase regulatory site that is unrelated to SREBP(17.Osborne T. Bennett M. Rhee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18973-18982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of a unique protein in regulation of HMG-CoA reductase would allow the cell to independently regulate cholesterol uptake from its biosynthesis. However, since the oxysterol-resistant mutant cell lines constitutively overproduce HMG-CoA reductase as well as HMG-CoA synthase and the LDL receptor, there is compelling genetic evidence suggesting HMG-CoA reductase is directly activated by SREBP as well. In the present studies we demonstrate that SREBP-1 directly activates the promoter for HMG-CoA reductase through non-canonical recognition sites in the previously characterized sterol regulatory region of the reductase promoter. HepG2 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in modified essential medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies. The wild type hamster HMG-CoA reductase promoter from −277 to +20 was fused to the luciferase coding sequence of the plasmid pGL2 basic (Promega, Inc.). The mutation containing a scrambled substitution of the bases from −161 to −152 in the reductase sterol regulatory DNA site of the otherwise wild type promoter was described before as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion construct plasmid D1(5.Osborne T.F. Gil G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3380-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The −277 to +20 region from this plasmid was fused to the luciferase coding sequence of pGL2 basic as well and referred to as “mut” in the present studies. The plasmid with a generic TATA element from the hamster HMG-CoA synthase promoter fused to the luciferase gene has been described previously(18.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The plasmids “3X Wt” and “3xmut” were constructed in two steps. First, the simple Sp1 site of repeat 3 from the human LDL receptor promoter was inserted upstream of the generic TATA element in the above plasmid. Then oligonucleotides containing three tandem copies of the sequence from the wild type reductase promoter from −161 to −136 or a mutant derivative with two base changes at −156 and −155 in all three otherwise normal copies were inserted upstream of the Sp1 site. Plasmids containing the desired insertions in the wild type orientation were identified and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing before further analyses. Methods for the oligonucleotide insertion procedures have been described previously(18.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal truncation derivatives of SREBP-1 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction with the wild type plasmid as template and appropriately designed oligonucleotides with a 10 to 1 mixture of Taq and Pfu polymerases. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned into the pRSET expression vector from Invitrogen. HepG2 cells were plated on day 0 in 60-mm dishes at 175,000 cells/dish. On day 1 the dishes were refed and transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Precipitates contained 20 μg each of reductase-luciferase plasmid and CMV2 β-Gal plus 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 2 ml of solution. 0.5 ml were added to each of four dishes which were incubated for 4-6 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. The dishes were treated with 1 ml of glycerol (20% (v/v) in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline) and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and refed the same medium as above. Following a 36-h incubation the cells were harvested by scraping, cells from duplicate dishes were pooled, and extracts were prepared by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. A cytomegalovirus promoter based expression plasmid was used to express a transcriptionally active fragment of the human SREBP-1 protein (amino acids 1-490) and this plasmid has been described before(18.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This expression plasmid was included in the DNA precipitate such that the amount indicated in the figure was added to each 60-mm dish. Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer with a luciferin reagent from Promega Biotech. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by a standard colorimetric procedure with 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate(19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 545Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity in relative light units was divided by the β-galactosidase activity (activity/h) for each extract. The experiments presented here represent data from three independent transfections performed in duplicate for each plasmid. There was less than 10% variation between individual experiments. Fold activation was calculated as the ratio of corrected luciferase activity (ratio of luciferase to β-gal) obtained for a specific plasmid measured when cells were transfected with the indicated amount of SREBP-1 expression plasmid relative to the corrected luciferase activity measured for the reporter plasmid when it was transfected alone. Wild type and mutant forms of recombinant SREBP-1 protein were purified by metal chelation chromatography from extracts of Escherichia coli as described(8.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar, 18.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The quality of the purified proteins were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis performed with marker proteins followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The concentration of active protein was determined by performing a gel mobility shift titration with varying amounts of protein extract in the presence of a vast excess of 32P-labeled SREBP binding site from the LDL receptor. The concentration of DNA-protein complex at the saturation point was used to estimate the active concentration (M) of SREBP protein assuming a 1:1 molar ratio of protein to DNA in the complex. The LDL receptor SRE-1 element oligonucleotide was described before(18.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The sequence of the reductase wild type oligonucleotide is shown in Fig. 1C. Single nucleotide mutant derivatives of this element were made at positions indicated in Fig. 1A. The top DNA strand of the other double stranded oligonucleotides used in the binding studies were as follows (important homology elements are underlined). The 3′ SRE-1 element of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter was 5′-GATCCAGTCAACTAGTCTCACCCCACTTCC-3′, the 5′ SRE-1 from the synthase was 5′-GATCTGTTCTCGGGCCACCCTACGTCACCG-3′. These were taken from the study of Smith et al.(4.Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18480-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity E-box site was 5′-GATCCTGATCACGTGATCGAGGAG-3′ and was taken from the binding site selection studies performed by Kim et al.(16.Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The complementary oligonucleotides were designed to hybridize such that there was a four-base sticky end at each side of GATC for ease of labeling with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Analytical experiments were performed with 0.02 pmol of DNA probe and 10 ng of recombinant SREBP-1 protein (or an equivalent molar amount of a truncated version). Gel conditions were exactly as described before(18.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For the competition experiments of Fig. 1A the competitor DNAs (200-fold molar excess) were preincubated with protein for 15 min on ice prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled wild type reductase DNA probe. For the quantitative experiments of Fig. 4 and Table 1, protein extract was serially diluted in buffer containing 200 μg/ml cytochrome c to stabilize the diluted SREBP-1 protein. DNA binding and gel electrophoresis were identical to the standard analytical experiments. The gels were fixed by soaking in an aqueous mixture of acetic acid (10% v/v) and methanol (10% v/v) prior to drying and analysis with the aid of a Bio-Rad model GS250 phosphoimaging system. Regions corresponding to the singly liganded complex and the free DNA were identified in each lane and integrated using a constant spot volume (pixel density units) which was then analyzed using the Sigmaplot software package. The protein-DNA titration (Fig. 5) was plotted as the fraction of DNA bound (ordinate) versus active protein (M, abscissa). The equilibrium association constants (Keq, M-1) were determined by fitting the fraction of bound DNA to the Langmuir expression(20.Brenowitz M. Senear D. Jamison E. Dalma-Weiszhausz D. Revzin A. Footprinting of Nucleic Acid-Protein Complexes. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 1-43Crossref Google Scholar), Fraction bound=[SREBP][Keq]/1+[SREBP][Keq]Eq. 1 The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is equal to 1/Keq.Tabled 1Figure 5Quantitative comparison of SREBP-1 binding to different recognition sites. Protein titration assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with recombinant SREBP-1 derivatives containing residues 1-490 (left), 234-490 (center), or 321-490 (right) on the five different DNA binding sites. The identities of the probe DNAs are as follows: the LDL receptor SRE-1 (open circles), HMG-CoA reductase site of Fig. 1(closed circles), the HMG-CoA synthase 3′ SRE-1 (open triangles), the synthase 5′ SRE-1 (filled triangles), and the high affinity E-box (open squares). The fraction of DNA probe bound (ordinate) is plotted versus the log of the active molar protein concentration (abscissa). These data were used to calculate the Kd values displayed in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) [32P]DNA probes were prepared from the indicated plasmids, incubated with SREBP-1 and digested with DNase I as described(18.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Methylation interference was performed as described previously(17.Osborne T. Bennett M. Rhee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18973-18982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strong genetic evidence discussed above suggested the HMG-CoA reductase promoter may be a direct target for activation by SREBPs and since SREBP-1 and −2 have a similar domain structure and seem to bind and activate the same promoters, all of the present studies have been performed with SREBP-1. A DNA fragment corresponding to the well characterized sterol regulatory site from −161 to −136 of the hamster reductase promoter was used as a probe in a gel mobility shift experiment with a recombinant form of SREBP-1 protein corresponding to amino acids 1-490 (Fig. 1A). This includes all of the protein information required for DNA binding and transcriptional activation(9.Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 12.Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 bound with high affinity and specificity to the reductase probe. The specificity was evaluated by using a series of competitor oligonucleotides corresponding to the exact same DNA fragment except for a single base change as indicated above each lane on the gel in Fig. 1A. Competitor DNAs containing a single mutation at each contiguous base from −156 to −152 corresponding to ATGGT (lanes 5-9) did not compete for SREBP binding and a change from a guanosine to a thymidine (lane 12) also competed less effectively than the other DNA probes. All other single point mutant derivatives competed effectively indicating that alterations at these other positions did not perturb specific recognition by SREBP-1. In addition, binding was also abolished by including a competitor DNA containing the classic SRE-1 element from the LDL receptor (lane 16). To further characterize this reductase SREBP-1 binding site we performed a methylation interference experiment (Fig. 1B). Methylation of the N-7 position of the guanosine residues at −151, −153, −154, and −157 on the top strand and −150 of the bottom strand decreased binding by SREBP-1. The data of Fig. 1, A and B, are summarized on the DNA sequence of this region shown in Fig. 1C. The SREBP binding region corresponds to a focused area with critical residues that span 9 base pairs from −156 to −149. Importantly, the nucleotide mutations that diminish SREBP-1 binding also decreased regulation by sterols in a previous study ((15.Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and see Fig. 2B). It should be noted that this site corresponds to the previously identified sterol regulatory site and not the overlapping SRE-1 homology (underlined in Fig. 1C) that was originally proposed(4.Smith J.R.

We also evaluated the binding of SREBP-1 to the reductase promoter by the DNase I footprinting procedure. A radioactive probe labeled on the top strand was incubated with recombinant SREBP-1 before treatment with DNase I and electrophoresis through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The results demonstrate that SREBP-1 binds specifically to three separated regions on the HMG-CoA reductase promoter fragment which are labeled footprints 1-3 in Fig. 2A. Footprint 2 corresponds to the DNA region used in the gel mobility shift studies of Fig. 1 and to the cis-acting site required for sterol regulation defined by our earlier studies. Footprints 1 and 3 define other sites of SREBP binding in the reductase promoter. A mutation of footprint 1 was not directly evaluated in previous studies and its role in sterol regulation is unclear ((5.Osborne T.F. Gil G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3380-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and see “Discussion”). A mutation of the DNA region corresponding to footprint 3 was previously shown to result in a severe drop in promoter activity but sterol regulation appeared to be maintained(5.Osborne T.F. Gil G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3380-3387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is probably due to the dominant effect of the footprint 2 region on sterol regulation. The sterol regulatory mutations from our previous single nucleotide mutagenesis study (15.Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clustered into two areas of SREBP footprint 2: one identified a short four-base site from −166 to −163 and the other from −159 to −150 (see Fig. 2B). This suggested there are two separate protein binding sites in this interval. To evaluate the possibility that SREBP-1 interacted at two separated sites in this region we prepared probes for DNase I protection studies from mutant promoters with a single base mutation in each clustered sterol sensitive region. When a probe with a sterol compromising mutation at −155 was used in the DNase I protection experiment, SREBP bound normally to footprints 1 and 3 but the degree of protection over the footprint 2 region was confined to a smaller area on one side of the wild type footprint and away from the position of the point mutation (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 7). A similar result was obtained when a probe with a single base mutation at −166 was used, however, the narrowed area of nuclease protection was confined to the opposite side of the wild type footprint which again is in the area away from the location of the single point mutation (compare lanes 4, 7, and 10). These DNase I footprinting results indicate there are three regions where SREBP-1 binds to the promoter for HMG-CoA reductase and one of them (footprint 2) contains two recognition sites. When the sequence of all three footprint elements are compared with each other and the two sterol sensitive sites of protection in footprint 2 are considered separately there is a limited degree of sequence similarity. Interestingly, this similarity (underlined in Fig. 2B) corresponds to an SREBP-1 “half-site” as proposed by Smith (21.Smith J.R. Feedback Regulation of Genes Controlling Cholesterol Metabolism. University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas1990Google Scholar) and Yokoyama et al.(8.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar). The experiments presented so far document that SREBP-1 binds specifically to the HMG-CoA reductase promoter in a manner consistent with it being involved in sterol regulation. Next, we performed transient DNA transfection studies to evaluate activation by SREBP-1. The wild type reductase promoter was fused to the luciferase reporter gene and the resulting plasmid was transfected into HepG2 cells along with a plasmid that expressed the mature transcriptionally active form of SREBP-1 (amino acids 1-490) constitutively from the cytomegalovirus promoter. We reproducibly observed a 10-20-fold activation of the reductase prom"

The possible clinical importance fuels an intensive research activity toward a better understanding of the molecular structure and mechanism of action of these membrane transporters(1.Endicott J.A.

Both P-glycoprotein and MRP, together with several other bacterial and eukaryotic transporters, are members of the ABC-transporter (ATP-binding cassette) protein family. These proteins share a common molecular architecture, i.e. they contain two large transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic ATP utilization (ABC) units (4.Higgins C.F Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty of crystallizing large membrane proteins, no detailed three-dimensional structure of any members of these transporters is currently available, and empirical prediction methods are used to obtain molecular models of their structure, especially to predict the locations and numbers of the membrane-spanning helices. In most cases, these methods identify six short transmembrane segments in each of the two transmembrane domains(1.Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar, 2.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 3.Cole S.P.C.

The relevance of the prediction for the membrane topology of CFTR has been confirmed experimentally by insertional mutagenesis(5.Chang X-B. Hou Y-X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus proving the 2 × 6 transmembrane helix model. The same arrangement of transmembrane helices has been suggested in the case of P-glycoprotein(6.Gros P. Croop J. Housman D.

When the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) was cloned and sequenced, analysis of its primary amino acid sequence revealed that MRP is more closely related to CFTR than to P-glycoprotein(3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardway G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurtz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley G.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar).

In the present experiments, we have examined the membrane topology of MRP by immunodetection with flow cytometry in intact and permeabilized cells, by limited proteolysis of isolated membranes with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and by immunoblotting of the proteolytic fragments with antipeptide antibodies, reacting either with the N-terminal or the C-terminal half of the protein. By using glycosylated and underglycosylated forms of MRP, its major sites of glycosylation could be determined. We have compared the experimental findings with a newly developed membrane topology model of MRP, based on the experimentally confirmed transmembrane topology of CFTR. According to our results, the transmembrane topology of MRP does not follow the model predicted by Cole et al.(3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardway G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J.

This was performed under standard conditions(12.Homolya L. Holló Zs. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

This tunicamycin treatment slightly slowed down cell growth but did not significantly decrease cell viability. Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were cultured and infected with a baculovirus as described in (15.Germann U.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2295-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses, carrying the human MRP cDNA, were generated by using the BaculoGold Transfection Kit (PharMingen), according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Baculovirus transfer vector containing the human MRP cDNA was constructed as follows: a SalI-BamHI fragment was removed from pJ3Ω-MRP vector(13.Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. van Leusden M.R. de Haas M. Mülder H.S. Lankelma J. Pinedo H.M. Scheper R.J. Baas F. Broxterman H.J. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was subcloned into M13mp18, and a new XbaI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at position −5 of MRP cDNA(16.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), and the entire insert was sequenced. The fragment containing the mutation was inserted back into its original position in pJ3Ω-MRP. The MRP cDNA was isolated from this modified plasmid by digestion with XbaI and NotI and subcloned into pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen). For membrane preparation and proteolysis, the human tumor cells and the virus-infected Sf9 cells were harvested, their membranes were isolated and stored, and the membrane protein concentrations were determined, as described in (17.Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For proteolytic digestion, the membranes (100-300 μg of protein) were incubated in a reaction buffer of MOPS (50 mM), KCl (50 mM), EGTA (0.5 mM), dithiothreitol (0.5 mM), pH 7.0, in a final volume of 400 μl, in the presence of 5-50 μg of trypsin (type XIII, Sigma) or 5-50 μg of α-chymotrypsin (type VII, Sigma) for 10 min at 4°C. Thereafter, the reaction was stopped with excess soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type 1-S) or trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (Sigma, Bowman-Birk, from soybean), and the membranes were washed twice with 1 ml of the incubation buffer with 1-min centrifugations at 12,000 × g. The pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of the electrophoresis buffer, and the samples (25 μl) were run on 6%, 7.5%, or 10% Laemmli-type gels, thereafter electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was performed by dissolving and sonicating the isolated membranes in a disaggregation buffer(17.Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol.

Detection of human MRP with the R1 (rat mAb, 500 × diluted) and M6 (mouse mAb, 200 × diluted) anti-MRP monoclonal antibodies (see (18.Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M.

The second antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (anti-rat or anti-mouse, peroxidase-conjugated donkey IgG, 20,000 × diluted). Peroxidase-dependent luminescence on the blots (ECL, Amersham) was determined by autoradiography. For immunofluorescence staining, 106 cells were resuspended in PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde, and then incubated either with or without 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were incubated for 45 min in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin medium, and then labeling was performed in the same medium with the monoclonal antibody R1 (100 × diluted), which reacts with an N-terminal epitope of the human MRP protein (18.Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar) or with rat IgG2a isotype control mAb, at 4°C for 45 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and once with PBS, while the permeabilized cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Thereafter, an anti-rat-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody conjugate (Sigma, 300 × diluted) was applied, similarly to the first antibody. Finally, the cells were resuspended in PBS. Cellular fluorescence was measured with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and data were analyzed by the Winlist software (Verity Software House, Inc.). Calcein fluorescence was measured by incubating 2-5 × 105 cells/ml in HPMI medium(19.Homolya L. Holló Zs. Müller M. Mechetner E.B. Sarkadi B. Br. J.

As shown in Fig. 1A, in an immunoblot MRP is well recognized at the expected molecular mass both in the HL60 ADR and the S1MRP cells by the two monoclonal MRP-specific antibodies, R1 and M6, generated against peptide segments 192-360 (located at the N-terminal half), and two fused sequences from the C-terminal half (1294-1430 plus 1497-1531), respectively (18.Flens M.J.

As also shown in Fig. 1A, when the HL60 ADR or S1MRP cells are pretreated with tunicamycin (which prevents post-translational N-glycosylation) for 72 h, they express an underglycosylated form of MRP with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa, in only a slightly decreased quantity. In the baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, in which no complete glycosylation of large membrane proteins can be observed(15.Germann U.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2295-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the underglycosylated form of MRP, with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa was found to be expressed (Fig. 1A).Figure 4:Membrane topology model for the human MRP.

Bhardway G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurtz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley G.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar), the 192-360 peptide segment, the binding site of the R1 mAb, is localized extracellularly. However, as noted by Flens et al.(18.Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar), this mAb recognizes MRP only in permeabilized cells. Flens et al.(18.Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the lack of reaction of R1 with MRP in intact cells might be due to an epitope-shielding effect of glycosylation or to a complex conformation of this epitope in the matured MRP protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, in flow cytometry experiments with HL60 ADR cells, both the fully glycosylated and the underglycosylated (tunicamycin-treated) MRP was recognized by R1 mAb when the cells were permeabilized by Triton X-100, while there was no mAb recognition in the intact cells, even when MRP was underglycosylated. These experiments exclude the possibility that a large carbohydrate side-chain shields the epitope of R1 in intact cells and suggest that the peptide region recognized by this mAb is located intracellularly. In order to examine the possible effect of glycosylation on the functional structure of MRP, we have studied the extrusion of calcein AM from S1MRP and HL60 ADR cells. As demonstrated earlier, calcein AM is actively extruded both from MDR1-expressing (12.Homolya L. Holló Zs. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2, the increase in cellular calcein fluorescence is much slower in the HL60 ADR (A) or in the S1MRP (B) cells than in the drug-sensitive parent cell lines, and in the MRP-expressing cells this rate is greatly increased by the addition of vinblastine. As shown previously(25.Holló Zs Homolya L. Hegedüs T. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26.Versantvoort C.H.M. Broxterman H.J. Bagajir T. Scheper R.J. Twentyman P.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the decreased formation of intracellular free calcein (restored to the control rate, for example, by vinblastine) in the MRP-expressing cells closely correlates with the drug extrusion function of MRP. Fig. 2 demonstrates that this calcein AM extrusion (that is the lower rate of free calcein production, restorable to the control value by vinblastine) is not significantly different in the HL60 ADR or S1MRP cells cultured for 72 h without or with tunicamycin, respectively (tunicamycin, which slightly interferes with calcein AM extrusion, was removed by washing before the experiments). It has been demonstrated earlier that neither the HL60 ADR nor the S1MRP cells contain any measurable amount of MDR1 (13.Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. van Leusden M.R. de Haas M. Mülder H.S. Lankelma J.

Thus, the function of MRP, at least according to this fluorescent dye extrusion assay, is unimpaired in the tumor cells expressing an underglycosylated protein, as compared to its fully glycosylated form (see Fig. 1A). This is in line with previous findings for the human MDR1 protein, which is also fully functional in an underglycosylated form(1.Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar, 2.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 27.Schinkel H.A. Kemp S. Dolle M. Rudenko G. Wagenaar E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flow cytometry experiments with R1 mAb and the above functional assay altogether strongly suggest that the N-linked glycosylation of MRP does not result in a major conformational alteration in its molecular structure. It is worth noting that tunicamycin, when present in the assay, inhibits calcein AM extrusion and increases the cytotoxic effect of adriamycin, thus probably directly inhibits MRP function. When the cultured HL60 ADR or S1MRP cells were treated with up to 2 mg/ml trypsin or chymotrypsin for 10 min at room temperature, there was no visible change in the immunoblot pattern of MRP. The transport function of the protein, as measured by calcein AM extrusion, remained intact as well under these conditions (data not shown). Thus, MRP has no easily accessible proteolytic cleavage sites on its extracellular surface. In the following experiments, we have performed limited proteolysis experiments in the isolated membranes of three different MRP-expressing cells, i.e. in human tumor cells expressing the native, glycosylated MRP, the same cells grown in the presence of tunicamycin, and in insect cells (Sf9), the latter both expressing an underglycosylated MRP. By using low concentrations of trypsin and chymotrypsin at 4°C, we obtained relatively large proteolytic fragments of MRP which could be distinguished clearly by immunoblotting with the two monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies, R1 and M6. As shown in Fig. 3, trypsin digestion of the glycosylated MRP, with an original molecular mass of about 180 kDa (lane 1), resulted in the predominant formation of a 110-kDa band, as detected by the N-terminal R1 mAb (A, lane 2), and in the formation of a wide 70-kDa band, as detected by the C-terminal M6 mAb (B, lane 2). Chymotrypsin digestion (lanes 3 on both panels) produced a fuzzy, 35-45-kDa band, as seen by the N-terminal mAb (A), and a predominant 140-150-kDa band, as seen by the C-terminal mAb (B, with further chymotrypsin digestion the bands corresponding to the trypsin digestion also appeared). In the case of the underglycosylated MRP, as expressed in the membranes of HL60 ADR + tunicamycin cells, and of Sf9 cells, the original 150-kDa MRP band (lanes 4 and 7 on both panels), after trypsin digestion yielded a 90-kDa band with the N-terminal R1 mAb (A, lanes 5 and 8), while a 50-55-kDa band (in some cases a doublet in this region) with the C-terminal M6 mAb (B, lanes 5 and 8). Chymotrypsin digestion in these cases produced a sharp 30-kDa band as seen by the N-terminally located mAb (A, lanes 6 and 9), and a predominant 120-kDa band, as seen by the C-terminally located mAb (B, lanes 6 and 9, again, with further chymotrypsin digestion the bands corresponding to the trypsin digestion also appeared). Based on these limited proteolysis experiments we can conclude that there are two preferentially accessible proteolytic sites on the cytoplasmic surface of the MRP protein, and that all three large fragments obtained are membrane-inserted (they are not removed by washing of the membranes after proteolysis). Moreover, the C-terminal and the N-terminal fragments are both glycosylated in the human HL60 cells, while the central fragment, based on the additive molecular mass values, is probably not glycosylated (we have no direct antibody detection for this fragment). As shown earlier for MDR1 and CFTR, these proteins are also preferentially proteolyzed at the large cytoplasmic loop between the two major membrane-inserted portions(1.Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar, 2.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

The above described experimental findings have been compared to a newly developed membrane topology model of MRP. The model described here is based on the comparison of the corrected amino acid sequence of MRP (3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardway G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurtz E.U.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and with a recently cloned yeast cadmium resistance protein, YCF1, which seems to be the closest relative of MRP(30.Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that when the CFTR and MRP sequences were aligned, the hydrophobicity analysis of the aligned sequences yielded a close matching of the transmembrane segments, thus suggesting a 6 + 6 transmembrane helix topology for MRP as well (Fig. 4A). However, MRP contains an additional N-terminal segment of about 200 amino acids, which has no counterpart in CFTRs or MDRs, but closely resembles the N-terminal region of the YCF1(30.Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that the mostly hydrophobic N-terminal segments of both YCF1 and MRP are membrane-embedded, and the Kyte-Doolittle analysis (21.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of this region predicts several transmembrane helices for both proteins. On the basis of these above described predictions, our membrane topology model for MRP, as shown in Fig. 4B, proposes three major membrane-inserted regions, separated by large cytoplasmic loops. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites in this model can be found on the extracellular portions of all three membrane-bound regions. In the N-terminal membrane-bound region, extracellular glycosylation sites could be obtained by two possible transmembrane helix predictions based on the hydrophobicity analysis (versions I and II in the model of Fig. 4B). Glycosylation of the second membrane-bound domain may not be probable, as a consensus site closer to the membrane than about 10 amino acids, is unlikely to be glycosylated in naturally expressed membrane proteins (see (31.Nilsson I. Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This model is strongly supported by our limited proteolysis data, producing three large, membrane-bound fragments of MRP, and experimentally confirming the glycosylation of both the N-terminal and the C-terminal membrane-spanning regions. The original prediction of Cole et al.(3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardway G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurtz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley G.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar) for the membrane topology of MRP identified two major membrane-bound segments, the N-terminal part with eight and the C-terminal region with four transmembrane helices. The first major trypsin cleavage site found in our experiments coincides with the predicted “linker” region of this model, C-terminally located from the first ABC domain. However, in this model(3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardway G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurtz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley G.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar), the whole 192-360 peptide region faces the extracellular space, with two possible N-glycosylation sites, while there is no glycosylation site further N-terminal from this region. In contrast, the membrane topology model described here with three membrane-bound domains suggests that a large portion of the 192-360 peptide region is intracellularly located and predicts an extra glycosylation site at the first N-terminal extracellular loop. Our model is strongly supported by (i) the lack of reactivity of R1 mAb with MRP in intact, nonpermeabilized cells, independently of the glycosylation status of MRP, (ii) preferential, intracellularly located proteolytic cleavage sites in this region, (iii) glycosylation of the protein further N-terminal from this proteolytic cleavage site. Altogether, the experimental findings are fully compatible with the model presented here for the membrane topology for MRP. We thank Drs. A. Schinkel and P. Borst for the helpful discussions and for providing the S1 and S1MRP cells. We are grateful to Dr. Melvin S. Center for the HL60 ADR cell line.

The authors, based on the homology with MRP(3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardway G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurtz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley G.G.

Alignment of the cMOAT and the MRP sequences (not shown here) indicates that the membrane topology model described above for MRP may be valid for cMOAT as well, thus suggesting a special structural feature for these proteins among ABC transporters."

https://openalex.org/W2052369011,"Profilin, an essential G-actin-binding protein, has two opposite regulatory functions in actin filament assembly. It facilitates assembly at the barbed ends by lowering the critical concentration (Pantaloni, D., and Carlier, M.-F.(1993) Cell 75, 1007-1014); in contrast it contributes to the pool of unassembled actin when barbed ends are capped. We proposed that the first of these functions required an input of energy. How profilin uses the ATP hydrolysis that accompanies actin polymerization and whether the acceleration of nucleotide exchange on G-actin by profilin participates in its function in filament assembly are the issues addressed here. We show that 1) profilin increases the treadmilling rate of actin filaments in the presence of Mg2+ ions; 2) when filaments are assembled from CaATP-actin, which polymerizes in a quasireversible fashion, profilin does not promote assembly at the barbed ends and has only a G-actin-sequestering function; 3) plant profilins do not accelerate nucleotide exchange on G-actin, yet they promote assembly at the barbed end. The enhancement of nucleotide exchange by profilin is therefore not involved in its promotion of actin assembly, and the productive growth of filaments from profilin-actin complex requires the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to profilin-actin assembly, a condition fulfilled by Mg-actin, and not by Ca-actin."

https://openalex.org/W1967100339,"The lantibiotic nisin of Lactococcus lactis is matured from a ribosomally synthesized prepeptide by post-translational modification. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that genes nisB and nisC of the nisin gene cluster encode proteins necessary for prenisin modification. Inactivation of both genes resulted in complete loss of nisin production. The preparation of membrane vesicles revealed that NisB and NisC are attached to the cellular membrane, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that they are associated with each other. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, which is a highly sensitive method to unravel protein-protein interactions, we could show that the nisin prepeptide physically interacts with the NisC protein, suggesting that NisC contains a binding site for prenisin. This was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of the NisC protein and the NisA prepeptide by antibodies directed against the leader sequence of the nisin prepeptide. The two-hybrid analysis also confirmed the interaction between NisB and NisC as well as the interaction between NisC and the NisT ABC transporter. A minor interaction was also indicated between prenisin and the NisB protein. Furthermore, the two-hybrid investigations also revealed that at least two molecules of NisC and two molecules of NisT are part of the modification and transport complex. Our results suggest that lantibiotic maturation and secretion occur at a membrane-associated multimeric lanthionine synthetase complex consisting of proteins NisB, NisC, and the ABC transporter molecules NisT."

The gas chromatographic/mass spectroscopy analysis of the fraction eluting at the retention time of NAS standard material showed that it contained NAS, further confirming production and release of NAS into the media by hamster skin. Therefore, we conclude that mammalian skin can acetylate serotonin to NAS and postulate that the NAS is further metabolized by the skin to form melatonin which is subsequently transformed to 5-MT. Biotransformation of [3H]serotonin by cultured hamster skin to 3H-metabolites corresponding to N-acetylserotonin (NAS), melatonin, and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT) was demonstrated. This process was time-dependent, with the highest production of radioactive NAS and melatonin metabolites after 3 and 5 h of incubation followed by a decrease in the rate of metabolite release into the media. Conversely, the formation of radioactive metabolite corresponding to 5-MT increased gradually during skin culture, reaching the highest level after 24 h of incubation. The production of 3H-metabolites, corresponding to NAS, melatonin, and 5-MT, was stimulated by forskolin with a maximum effect of forskolin at 10 μM concentration. The gas chromatographic/mass spectroscopy analysis of the fraction eluting at the retention time of NAS standard material showed that it contained NAS, further confirming production and release of NAS into the media by hamster skin. Therefore, we conclude that mammalian skin can acetylate serotonin to NAS and postulate that the NAS is further metabolized by the skin to form melatonin which is subsequently transformed to 5-MT. Melatonin serves as the main signal molecule which links the photoperiod to metabolic, endocrine, and immunological changes and which is mainly synthesized in the pineal gland, retina, brain, and Harderian gland(1.Yu H.-S. Reiter R.J. Melatonin Biosynthesis, Physiological Effects and Clinical Implications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). Depending of the site of production and target organ it can act as a hormone, neurotransmitter, cytokine, and biological modifier(2.Reiter R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 151-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Melatonin is a product of a two-step conversion of serotonin, which involves the acetylation of serotonin (3.Namboodiri M.A.A. Dubbels R. Klein D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and subsequent methylation by hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase(4.Sugden D. Cena V. Klein D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The majority of melatonin released into the bloodstream is metabolized in the liver and kidneys(5.Kopin I.J. Pare C.M.B. Axelrod J. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 3072-3075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Kveder S. McIsaac W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 3214-3220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mainly by 6-hydroxylation and conjugation to glucuronate or sulfate(5.Kopin I.J. Pare C.M.B. Axelrod J. Weissbach H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1961; 236: 3214-3220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to a minor degree by deacetylation to 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT), ( ∗The project was supported by a Mary Kay/Dermatology Foundation Research Grant (to A.

In contrast, melatonin bioconversion at the organ site of synthesis appears to be different from the metabolism of circulating melatonin(8.Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9.Grace M.S. Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. 1991; 559: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10.Grace M.S. Besharse J.C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For example, in the retina melatonin is first deacetylated to 5-MT, which can then be deaminated, producing 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol(8.Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9.Grace M.S. Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. 1991; 559: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Melatonin deacetylation to 5-MT was also detected in retinal pigment epithelium and non-mammalian skin that are target sites for melatonin bioregulation(8.Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9.Grace M.S. Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C.

Extracranial sites of both synthesis and metabolism of melatonin have also been demonstrated in the peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes(11.Finocchiaro L.M.E. Nahmod V.E. Launay J.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and according to some authors in the gastrointestinal tract(12.Huether G. Poeggler B. Reimer A. George A. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Melatonin production has not previously been demonstrated in skin, which is the largest body organ that can react to external and internal stimuli via the skin immune system(13.Bos J.D. Skin Immune System (SIS). CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar), the pigmentary system(14.Slominski A. Paus R. Schaderdorf D. J. Theor. Biol. 1993; 164: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the skin endocrine system(15.Slominski A. Paus R. Wortsman J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 93: C1-C6Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16.Milstone L.M. Edelson R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 548: 1-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In lower verterbrates skin is a recognized target for melatonin action, e.g. melatonin has lightening activity on the skin(17.Hadley M. Endocrinology. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1988Google Scholar). In mammals, it has been reported that melatonin can regulate hair growth(18.Champion R.H. Burton J.L. Ebling F.J.O. Textbook of Dermatology. 5th Ed. Backwell, Oxford1990Google Scholar), inhibit follicular melanogenesis(19.Logan A. Weatherhead B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1980; 74: 47-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and affect proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes (20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and malignant melanocytes(21.Slominski A. Pruski D. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Specific binding sites for melatonin were also detected in the mammalian skin(20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified two isozymic forms of arylamine N-acetyltransferase, NAT-1 and NAT-2, in hamster skin of which NAT-2 catalyzed the acetylation of dopamine to N-acetyldopamine and serotonin to NAS, a direct precursor of melatonin(22.Gaudet S. Slominski A. Etminan M. Pruski D. Paus R. Namboodiri M.A.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 660-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This information has formed the basis for the present studies on the synthesis and degradation of melatonin by mammalian skin. Three-month-old male Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus aureatus) were purchased from Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA, housed in community cages with 12-h light periods, and fed ad libitum with water and rat/mouse chow. The animals were sacrificed, hair shafts were removed with an electrical animal clipper, the skin was dissected at the level of of subcutis, and punch biopsies of skin were used for short-term skin culture as described previously(20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The incubations were started between 6 and 7 p.m. Three to five punch biopsies of skin per group were incubated together at the air-liquid interphase in 300 μl of medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture, all from Life Technologies, Inc.) in 24-well plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 in air and 100% humidity for 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, and 24 h. Four-mm punch biopsies were used throughout the study in order to standarize the tissue volume and thereby the cell mass in each fragment. In control experiments we used primary cell culture of hamster amelanotic melanoma cells (23.Slominski A. Moellmann G. Kuklinska E. Bomirski A. Pawelek J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 287-296PubMed Google Scholar). To measure DNA synthesis (20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) skin cultures were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine and, after defined periods of incubation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated 3 times for 30 min with continuous shaking in 2 M NaBr to remove nonincorporated thymidine(20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into each fragment was measured separately by liquid scintillation spectrometry (20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and expressed as the mean cpm (± S.E.) per skin biopsy. To study melatonin synthesis, 1, 5, or 10 μCi of [3H]serotonin/ml (DuPont) was added at 7 p.m. to the media and skin cultures were incubated in the presence or absence of forskolin at the concentrations listed. The media and skin were collected and processed separately. The media was extracted with chloroform (Sigma). Chloroform and aqueous phases were further separated by centrifugation in Microfuge at 16,000 × g. Both fractions were collected separately, centrifuged again to remove any impurities, and subjected to analysis by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analyses. Skin fragments from each culture were homogenized together in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, plus 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were then extracted in chloroform and processed as described above for media samples. Approximately a 100-μl sample of the tested fraction was injected onto the RP-HPLC column (Versapack C18 1OU, Alltech, Deerfield, IL), which was equilibrated using 0.1 N acetic acid (pH 4.0, flow rate = 1 ml/min). The elution was 0-10 min with acetic acid, 10-50 min with increased methanol from 0 to 100% and 50-60 min with a decreased methanol from 100 to 0% and was monitored at 280 nm using a UV detector. Starting at 20 min, elution fractions of 0.3-ml volume were collected. Each fraction was analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. During each separation via RP-HPLC of radiolabeled samples nonradioactive standards of serotonin, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), melatonin, and 5-MT (all from Sigma) were included and their retention was determined with ultraviolet detection at 280 nm. GC/MS analysis of serotonin, NAS, 5-MT, and melatonin in HPLC eluted fractions was performed with a Perkin-Elmer GC/MS system that included a Model 8420 capillary gas chromatograph with an open-split interface to an ion-trap mass spectrometer. A (5-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane capillary column (DB-5Ms, 15 m × 25-mm inner diameter) with a film thickness of 0.25 μm (J & W Scientific) was used. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A sample injection volume of 1 μl was used in the splitless mode. A column temperature program (100-300°C, 20°C/min) with a final hold of 5 min was used along with a column temperature of 250°C and an ion source temperature of 275°C. For electron impact ionization (EI), a mass spectral scan from 50 to 500 m/z was employed for full scan studies. In order to enhance sensitivity for detection of NAS EI with selective ion monitoring of ions with m/z 290, 303, and 362 was performed. Molecular weight determination of an unidentified compound with HPLC elution between serotonin and NAS was evaluated by chemical ionization (CI) employing methane gas and mass spectral scan of 50-500 m/z. Ion trap control, data aquisition, and analysis were performed with ITDS for Ion Trap Data System 4.1 (Perkin-Elmer). Preparation of HPLC fractions for GC/MS analysis was performed by initial drying of fraction samples. The dry residue was reconstituted with 1 ml of methanol, vortex mixed for 30 s, and transferred to a glass conical reaction vial. The samples were then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted with 25 μl of ethyl acetate and vortex mixed. For analysis of 5-MT and melatonin, 1 μl of an ethyl acetate reconstituted sample was used for analysis by GC/MS. For analysis of serotonin, NAS, and an unidentified peak, precolumn derivatization was performed by addition of N-methyl-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Regis Chemical Co., Morton Grove, IL) to the ethyl acetate reconstituted sample and incubated at 90°C for 20 min, followed by GC/MS analysis. For GC/MS identification of NAS in skin culture, biopsies were incubated for 12-14 h in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled serotonin. The media were extracted with chloroform, and the aqueous phase was analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above. Selected HPLC fractions were then analyzed by GC/MS using selective ion monitoring technique. To study the possible transformation of serotonin to melatonin by mammalian skin and further metabolism to 5-MT we used short-term skin culture system(20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under the conditions tested, the hamster skin remained viable and metabolically active for at least 24 h of incubation as evidenced by progressive increase in DNA synthesis throughout the incubation period (Fig. 1). After metabolic labeling with [3H]serotonin, the media and skin biopsies were prepared separately using chloroform extraction. Both chloroform and aqueous fractions were analyzed by RP-HPLC in the presence of nonradioactive serotonin, NAT, 5-MT, and melatonin standards. Fig. 2 shows representative elution times of tritriated serotonin metabolites released into the media after 5 h incubation in the presence of 5 μCi of [3H]serotonin. The radioactive peaks with retention times corresponding to those of unlabeled standards of NAS (28 min), 5-MT (32 min), and melatonin (36 min) were identified in chloroform extracts (Fig. 2A). HPLC analysis of the aqueous fraction from the same experiment showed the presence of a major radioactive peak corresponding to serotonin, the presence of a radioactive peak corresponding to NAS and the absence of radioactive peaks at the elution time of 5-MT and melatonin (Fig. 2B). The specificity of these findings were further confirmed by the absence of radioactive peaks of NAS, 5-MT, and melatonin in control media from primary cell culture of hamster amelanotic melanoma cells radiolabeled with 5 μCi of [3H]serotonin (not shown). The nature of the other radioactive peaks, including peaks eluting between NAS and 5-MT (30-31 min) and the major hydrophobic peak eluting at 40-42 min has not been determined. The GC/MS characteristic of the peak eluting at 26 min between serotonin and NAS is provided below. We have also attempted to characterize the 40-42-min hydrophobic peak using media from the culture performed in the presence of 100 μM unlabeled serotonin. Preliminary IR-mass spectroscopy suggests a nonaromatic compound (data not shown). This peak was also present in control medium (not shown) despite an absence of detectable transformation of serotonin into melatonin. We suggest that this peak may be unrelated to synthesis and degradation of melatonin and, therefore, we have narrowed our HPLC analyses to elution times of the serotonin, NAS, 5-MT, and melatonin standards. The spectrum of the RP-HPLC separation of skin extracts was similar to that obtained from culture media. The NAS, 5-MT, and melatonin peaks were present in the chloroform fraction, while the majority of the radioactivity corresponding to serotonin and NAS remained in the aqueous fraction (Fig. 3). Comparison of Figure 2:, Figure 3: shows that the serotonin metabolites accumulate predominantly in the culture media. GC/MS analysis of fractions obtained from the HPLC analysis of nonradioactive standard confirmed the identity and retention of serotonin, NAS, melatonin, and 5-MT (data not shown). To analyze culture media an incubation time of 12-14 h was chosen, when appreciable production of [3H]NAS was evident (Fig. 4). For GC/MS analyses, skin biopsies were incubated in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled serotonin and media were fractionated into chloroform and aqueous fractions which were separated by RP-HPLC. RP-HPLC results indicated that greater than 80% of NAS still remained in the aqueous phase and that less than 10% of the NAS is transformed into melatonin or 5-MT (Fig. 4). We, therefore, focused our GC/MS analysis on the aqueous fractions with retention times corresponding to serotonin and NAS. For GC/MS identification of NAS in skin culture media, an analysis of ion fragments resulting from EI analysis of purified NAS was initially performed. Fig. 5A shows a total ion count chromatograph of a standard preparation of NAS which was derivatized and chromatographed. The mass spectra insert shows ion fragments with m/z 73, 290 (base peak), 303, 362, and 435. A proposed structure of the ion fragments is shown, along with the mass spectra, in Fig. 5B. The fragmentation pattern indicates a molecular ion with trisilylated derivatization. The major ion fragment with m/z 290 results from ion impact fragmentation of the carbon-carbon bond in the alkyl side chain of the indole ring, leaving a disilylated fragment ion. The ion with m/z 303 is consistent with the loss of silylated N-acetyl group. A minor abundance of a mono-desilated ion fragment with m/z 362 is also observed with the corresponding trimethyl silyl ion fragment at m/z 73. Ions with m/z 434 and 435 are consistent with the trisilylated molecular ion and its proteinated form, respectively. Based on the mass spectrum analysis of NAS, ions with m/z 290, 303, and 362 were used in the GC/MS identification of NAS in the aqueous layer of the media from skin culture. Results of the GC/MS analysis of the RP-HPLC fraction eluting at 27-29 min are shown in Fig. 5C. The upper and middle panels show selective ion chromatograms for the m/z range of 290 to 303 and 290 to 362, respectively. Both chromatograms show a single peak eluting at a retention time consistent with NAS. In the lower panel is shown the relative abundance of ions with m/z 290, 303, and 362. Fig. 5D shows a parallel GC/MS analysis of pure NAS. The relative abundance of fragment ions with m/z 290, 303, and 362 shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5, C and D, evidence a close agreement of ion ratios for pure NAS and the compound isolated from skin culture media. Thus, the compound isolated from the skin culture media is identified as NAS based upon HPLC retention, gas chromatographic retention, and mass spectral fragmentation ions. Furthermore, we analyzed from aqueous phase the RP-HPLC fraction eluting at 25-26 min, which corresponds to the second major radioactive peak eluting between serotonin and NAS (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). The analysis was performed by EI and CI modes. The major compound in this fraction has a gas chromatographic retention time of 11 min 48 s. The EI mass spectrum resulted in ion fragments with m/z 73, 354, 410, and 426 (base peak). The ion with m/z 426 also predominated in the CI analysis. Although we do not yet have the structural identity of this compound, we propose that it is a product of serotonin metabolism with a molecular weight of 425 daltons for the derivatized compound. The mass spectrum of the unknown compound was not consistent with the structures of 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde, 5-hydroxytryptophol, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, 5-methoxytryptophol, and 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid. To study time-dependent changes in transformation of serotonin to melatonin and further to 5-MT as well as the effect of forskolin (10 μM) on this process, media, after different times of incubation, were chloroform fractionated and separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 6). The representative HPLC elution characteristics after 3, 5, and 24 h of incubation are shown in Fig. 6A-C, respectively, and panel D (summary panel) shows the levels of tritriated metabolites fractionated into the chloroform phase. The highest production of [3H]NAS and [3H]melatonin occurred between 3 and 5 h of incubation, which corresponded to 10 and 12 p.m., and then decreased with the lowest level observed at the 24 h of incubation (Fig. 6D). Conversely, the production of [3H]5-MT increased progressively during the time of incubation reaching the highest values at 24 h (Fig. 6, C and D). The data from representative RP-HPLC separations performed on the chloroform phase obtained after 6 h of incubation in the absence or presence of 1, 10, and 100 μM forskolin are presented in Fig. 7, A-E. The addition of forskolin stimulated production of tritiated NAS, melatonin, and 5-MT in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal stimulation at 10 μM concentration (Fig. 7C). In a separate experiment we analyzed the aqueous fraction by a RP-HPLC. It appeared that the NAS concentration in the aqueous fraction was higher in the presence of 10 μM forskolin than in control (not shown), which is consistent with the data presented in Fig. 7. In previous studies with hamster skin, we have identified and characterized the NAT-2 isozymic form of arylamine N-acetyltransferase that catalyzed the acetylation of serotonin to NAS, a direct precursor of melatonin, thus suggesting a non-rhythmic formation of N-acetylserotonin(22.Gaudet S. Slominski A. Etminan M. Pruski D. Paus R. Namboodiri M.A.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 660-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now have direct experimental evidence showing that mammalian skin can transform [3H]serotonin to radioactive metabolites eluting at the same time as noradioactive NAS, melatonin, and 5-MT standards. The GC/MS confirmed that coeluting nonradioactive standards separated by RP-HPLC were serotonin, NAS, melatonin, and 5-MT. Furthermore, the GC/MS analysis of the fraction eluting at the same time as NAS confirms the presence of NAS. Therefore, we conclude that mammalian skin in vivo can transform serotonin into NAS. Moreover, on the basis of RP-HPLC separation data we postulate that in the skin the NAS is further transformed to melatonin and suggest that it is subsequently deacetylated to 5-MT analogous to the metabolic pathway in the retina(8.Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9.Grace M.S. Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. 1991; 559: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10.Grace M.S. Besharse J.C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). According to our estimation, the production of NAS is comparatively higher than its further transformation to melatonin, i.e. approximately 1-2% of [3H]serotonin added is transformed to [3H]NAS, of which less than 10% is metabolized further to [3H]melatonin and [3H]5-MT. This may be explained by a lower efficiency of the hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase in transforming NAS to melatonin and by existence of an alternative pathway directly metabolizing NAS. The rate at which hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase changes in response to stimuli is relatively slow as compared to that of the arylalkylamine NAT(24.Binkley S. Macbride S.E. Klein D.C. Ralph C.L. Endocrinology. 1975; 96: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25.Klein D.C. Moore R.Y. Brain Res. 1979; 174: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In the pineal gland and retina the generation of melatonin production exhibits a circadian rhythm with the peak activity at night(1.Yu H.-S. Reiter R.J. Melatonin Biosynthesis, Physiological Effects and Clinical Implications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar, 2.Reiter R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 151-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). This process is accompanied by an increased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis, arylalkylamine NAT that acetylates serotonin to NAS(1.Yu H.-S. Reiter R.J. Melatonin Biosynthesis, Physiological Effects and Clinical Implications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar, 2.Reiter R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 151-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 3.Namboodiri M.A.A. Dubbels R. Klein D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These processes are stimulated by the rise in the intracellular concentrations of cAMP(1.Yu H.-S. Reiter R.J. Melatonin Biosynthesis, Physiological Effects and Clinical Implications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar, 2.Reiter R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 151-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 3.Namboodiri M.A.A. Dubbels R. Klein D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is of interest that in skin culture the highest production of [3H]NAS and [3H]melatonin was observed at 10 and 12 p.m. and that this process appeared to be stimulated by forskolin (stimulator of intracellular cAMP accumulation(1.Yu H.-S. Reiter R.J. Melatonin Biosynthesis, Physiological Effects and Clinical Implications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar, 2.Reiter R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 151-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 3.Namboodiri M.A.A. Dubbels R. Klein D.C.

Therefore, it is possible that a mechanism governing cutaneous production of NAS and melatonin may be similar to that operating in the pineal gland and retina. This requires further study. In non-mammalian vertebrates, degradation of melatonin at the site of its action such as retinal pigment epithelium and skin, or at site of its extrapineal production, retina, occurred predominatly via melatonin deacetylation to 5-MT(8.Cahill G.M.

In the present study we show the gradual increase of [3H]5-MT during skin culture, which reached its highest level after 24 h of incubation, and which was accompanied by a decrease in [3H]NAS and [3H]melatonin concentration. Furthermore, it was reported previously that rodent skin is a site for melatonin bioregulation(20.Slominski A. Chassalevris N. Mazurkiewicz J. Maurer M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1994; 3: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on this information and the data presented above we suggest that rodent skin, similar to non-mammalian skin and retina(8.Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9.Grace M.S. Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. 1991; 559: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10.Grace M.S.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), deacetylates melatonin to 5-MT in order to terminate its action or to generate methoxyindoles with a potential local biological activity. Previously Finocchiaro et al.(11.Finocchiaro L.M.E. Nahmod V.E. Launay J.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed melatonin biosynthesis and metabolism in peripheral blood leukocytes, while Huether et al.(12.Huether G. Poeggler B. Reimer A. George A. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have suggested a possible melatonin synthesis in the gut. This last finding, however, was disputed by others(26.Brammer G. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Presented here are data supporting the concept that there are extracranial and peripherially located sites of melatonin synthesis (11.Finocchiaro L.M.E. Nahmod V.E. Launay J.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since the integumentum has the same embryonal origin as the central nervous system(27.Gilbert S.F. Developmental Biology. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1988Google Scholar), it is not surprising that skin is capable of producing neurohormones and expressing corresponding receptors(15.Slominski A. Paus R. Wortsman J.

Skin is composed of many unrelated cells of neuroectodermal and mesenchymal origin including melanocytes, Merkel cells, keratinocytes, resident, and circulating immune response associated cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and fat cells(13.Bos J.D.

In conclusion, we show that the mammalian skin can produce NAS, melatonin, and 5-MT and suggest that production of 5-MT may represent a local mechanism of melatonin inactivation. Thus, the skin appears to be both a target for melatonin bioregulation and a site of its synthesis and degradation.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a potent mitogen for many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells(3.Gospodarowicz D. Ferrara N. Haaparanta T. Neufeld G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 144-151PubMed Google Scholar). Basic FGF is found in quiescent smooth muscle cells of the arterial media(4.Olson N.E. Chao S. Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 1017-1023PubMed Google Scholar), and its release following vascular injury has been implicated in driving the initial proliferative response of medial smooth muscle cells, at least by a paracrine mechanism(5.Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The concomitant expression of both bFGF and cell surface FGF receptors by smooth muscle cells suggests that autocrine FGF signaling has important phenotypic consequences. Autocrine FGF signaling has been reported to contribute to smooth muscle cell migration (6.Sato Y. Hamanaka R. Ono J. Kuwano M. Rifkin D.B. Takaki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and may also participate in proliferation, as has been reported for other cell types(7.Becker D. Meier C.B. Herlyn M.

Other consequences of autocrine FGF signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, such as the promotion of cell survival, have not been explored. basic fibroblast growth factor fibroblast growth factor polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription-PCR glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fetal bovine serum. A variety of cell types that are either terminally differentiated or normally remain in a quiescent state in the adult organism express FGF, but the autocrine functions of FGF in this context have not been elucidated. There is good experimental evidence that FGF can reside in the extracellular matrix around nondividing cells as a storage form, with its mitogenic activity available in the event of tissue damage and a requirement for repair or scar formation(11.Flaumenhaft R. Moscatelli D. Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12.Terrell G.E. Swain J.L.

Biochem. 1991; 45: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the widespread expression and intracellular location of FGF in nondividing cells suggests other functions, and has spurred studies of the ability of FGF to promote cell survival. The survival-promoting activity appears to be distinct from the mitogenic effects of FGF, as it has been documented in nonproliferating cells(14.Tamm I. Kikuchi T. Zychlinsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3372-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15.Renaud F. Oliver L. Desset S. Tassin J. Romquin N. Courtois Y. Laurent M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), including terminally differentiated cells of neuronal origin(16.Unsicker K. Reichert-Preibsch H. Wewetzer K. Brain Res. 1992; 65: 285-288Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17.Louis J.C. Magal E. Gerdes W. Seifert W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1610-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). How FGFs promote survival through an autocrine mechanism in this context has not been defined but may be through the prevention of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. That FGFs are autocrine survival factors has been suggested by studies in vitro(15.Renaud F. Oliver L. Desset S. Tassin J. Romquin N. Courtois Y. Laurent M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in vivo(18.Blottner D. Baumgarten H.G. Exp. Neurol. 1992; 118: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The notion that exogenous FGFs promote survival by preventing apoptosis, at least through a paracrine mechanism, has been suggested by studies in PC12 cells (19.Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and endothelial cells(20.Araki S. Shimada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 21.Haimovitz-Friedman A. Balaban N. McLoughlin M. Ehleiter D. Michaeli J. Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2591-2597PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies do not distinguish between the survival function of FGFs and either their ability to modulate phenotype or stimulate mitogenesis. These observations, coupled with the presence of bFGF in medial smooth muscle cells of the arterial media, prompted the hypothesis that autocrine bFGF supports smooth muscle cell proliferation, survival, or both. Vascular smooth muscle contributes to normal vessel function, the development of vascular diseases, and the response to vascular injury. There is a growing appreciation that smooth muscle cell apoptosis contributes to vascular development, physiologic adaptation, and vascular remodeling in response to the natural progression or invasive treatment of human vascular disease(22.Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 23.Cho A. Courtman D.W. Langille B.L. Circ.

Circulation. 1995; 91: 2703-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The role of autocrine FGF signaling in smooth muscle cell proliferation or survival has not been clearly defined. In order to probe the autocrine function of bFGF in vascular smooth muscle cells, endogenous expression was inhibited using an antisense strategy, and the functional consequences were examined. The Ad.ASbFGF virus was constructed by replacement of the β-galactosidase cDNA with a 1.1-kilobase rat bFGF cDNA containing the entire coding sequence plus 5′-untranslated region sequences (gift of Dr. Andrew Baird, Whittier Institute; GenBank accession number M22427) (26.Shimasaki S. Emoto N. Koba A. Mercado M. Shibata F. Cooksey K. Baird A. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) in the pAd.CMVlacZ shuttle vector (gift of Dr. James Wilson, University of Pennsylvania). The resulting shuttle vector pAd.CMV.ASbFGF was cotransfected with the E1-, E3-deleted, human adenovirus serotype 5 mutant dl7001 (27.Yang Y. Raper S.E. Cohn J.A. Engelhardt J.F. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Geske R.S. Finnigan J.P. Rodgers G.P. Roberts R. Raizner A.E. Circulation. 1994; 90: 2402-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), were used as control viruses in these and subsequent experiments. Recombinant adenovirus was identified by PCR amplification of putative recombinant plaques using one vector-specific and one insert-specific primer. The vector-specific primer (5′-AGACATGATAAGATACAT-3′) corresponds to a region of the shuttle vector upstream of the insert cloning site but contains no adenoviral genomic sequence. The insert-specific primer (5′-GCTTCTTCCTGCGCATCC-3′) corresponds to codons 37-42 of the 18-kDa rat bFGF coding sequence. The recombinant virus was twice plaque-purified, and expression of the antisense transcript was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Total cellular RNA (1 μg) isolated from uninfected smooth muscle cells or cells infected with either Ad.ASbFGF or Ad5/RSV/GL2 was heat-denatured (65°C for 5 min) and reverse-transcribed using 0.5 pmol of a sequence-specific primer. This primer contains 18 bases (5′-ACTTCGCTTCCCGCACTG-3′) of bFGF sequence complementary to the antisense strand (corresponding to codons 7-12 of 18-kDa rat bFGF) at the 3′ end, as well as a 30-base random sequence at the 5′ end (5′-CTTATACGGATATCCTGGCAATTCGGACTT-3′). The 5′ end random sequence tag permits subsequent PCR amplification with a primer corresponding to this tag sequence only, thus rendering the overall amplification both strand- and RNA-specific(30.Shuldiner A.R. Perfetti R. Roth J. White B.A. PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 169-176Google Scholar). The 5′ primer used for the PCR amplification (5′-GCACACACTCCCTTGATGGACAC-3′) corresponds to codons 71-78 of 18-kDa rat bFGF. As controls, each of the cellular RNAs was also reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers (1 pmol), and these cDNA products were subsequently amplified using primers (5′-primer: 5′-CCTGAAGGGTGGTGCAAAAG-3′; 3′-primer: 5′-CCATCCACAGTCTTCTGAGTG-3′) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Reverse transcription was performed in a final reaction volume of 20 μl using 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the supplier's recommendations, and controls included ASbFGF and sense GAPDH RNA transcripts generated in vitro using cDNA templates and bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as well as a no-template negative control. The ASbFGF in vitro transcript yields a 246-base pair RT-PCR amplification product that is indistinguishable from that generated from the ASbFGF recombinant adenoviral transcript; the GAPDH cDNA used to generate the in vitro transcript contains a 106-base deletion relative to the native mRNA, which is flanked by the PCR primer sites and thus generates a smaller RT-PCR amplification product (132 base pairs versus 238 base pairs, respectively). Ten percent of each cDNA product was amplified using 1 pmol of each pair of relevant primers, with one primer in each reaction 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). The PCR was performed in a 20-μl volume using 1 unit/reaction of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in an Ericomp thermal cycler (San Diego, CA) for 25 cycles using 1-min steps. Denaturation was done at 94°C, annealing at 60°C, and extension at 72°C. Products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel and detected by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (gift of Dr. Gary Owens, University of Virginia) were cultured in DF12 (equal parts Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F12 media) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Subconfluent cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses and 3 days later harvested with trypsin, homogenized, and partially purified by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) essentially as described(31.Speir E. Tanner V. Gonzalez A.M. Farris J. Baird A. Casscells W. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Lysates from equal numbers of cells were loaded onto the heparin affinity matrix, eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in Tris-glycine buffer containing methanol and SDS. The three isoforms of rat bFGF (32.Brigstock D.R. Klagsbrun M. Sasse J. Farber P.A. Iberg N. Growth Factors. 1990; 4: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were determined by probing with a monoclonal anti-bovine bFGF antibody (Type II, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.) using a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated with peroxidase, as recommended by the manufacturer. Similar results were obtained by immunoblotting whole cell lysates without prior affinity enrichment, and reprobing these blots with an antibody directed against β-actin demonstrated equivalent protein loading (data not shown). For the bFGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) rescue experiments, 25 ng/ml recombinant human bFGF (Upstate Biotechnology) or 50 ng/ml human EGF (Upstate Biotechnology) was added directly to each well daily. Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise specified. Electrophoresis and other chemicals were from Boehringer Mannheim, Sigma, or Fisher (Fairlawn, NJ). For assessment of cellular and nuclear morphology, cells were grown on glass coverslips, infected with recombinant adenoviruses, and 48-72 h later fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Coverslips were imaged without staining under phase contrast optics or stained with 0.015% propidium iodide (Sigma) and imaged with epifluorescence illumination. The percentage of apoptotic cells was estimated by counting the numbers of apoptotic (condensed or fragmented) nuclei in at least 1000 cells imaged in contiguous fields on each coverslip, and the mean ± S.D. was calculated from determinations made on three independent coverslips. For 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μM BrdU (Sigma) for 2 h prior to harvest, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and stained for BrdU using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Becton-Dickenson, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The BrdU-positive cells were imaged by epifluorescence microscopy, the percentage of positive cells was counted in at least 1000 cells in contiguous fields on each coverslip, and the mean ± S.D. was calculated from determinations made on three independent coverslips. For the detection of DNA strand breaks, cells were grown and infected on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, labeled using the fluorescein-based ApopTag kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and imaged by epifluorescence microscopy. Photomicrographs were obtained using Kodak Ektachrome film (Rochester, NY) and either a Zeiss Optiphot or an Olympus AX-70 microscope at × 200-400 magnification using phase contrast optics or epifluorescence with appropriate filters. For the detection of oligonucleosomal fragmentation, cells were collected with trypsin and subjected to hypotonic lysis in buffer containing Triton X-100, and a low molecular weight DNA fraction was isolated as described(33.Yasuda T. Grinspan J. Stern J. Franceschini B. Bannerman P. Pleasure D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight fraction from equal numbers of cells was separated by electrophoresis through agarose, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by transillumination with UV light using an Eagle Eye apparatus (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). Total cellular DNA isolated from v-myc-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts exposed to 10 Gy of γ-radiation (gift of E. Bernhard) was used as a positive control for oligonucleosomal fragmentation. For flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle phase distribution, cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses and harvested with trypsin, and nuclei were prepared and stained with propidium iodide as described(34.Vindel⊘v L.L. Christensen I.J. Cytometry. 1990; 11: 753-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACScan cytometer (Becton-Dickenson, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using ModFitLT curve-fitting software (Verity Software, Topsham, ME) running on a Macintosh computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). For tritiated thymidine labeling, sham- or adenovirus-infected cells were labeled 2 days following infection for 12 or 18 h in serum-free medium containing 1-2 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Corp.), fixed in trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in dilute NaOH, and collected by filtration, and incorporation was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman Instruments, Columbia, MD). Expression of an antisense bFGF RNA (Fig. 1A) by a recombinant adenovirus (Ad.ASbFGF) in cultured smooth muscle cells markedly reduced cellular bFGF content (Fig. 1B). To test the hypothesis that inhibition of endogenous bFGF expression reduces either smooth muscle cell proliferation or survival, cell number was monitored following Ad.ASbFGF infection (Fig. 2). The expected accumulation of smooth muscle cells cultured in 10% FBS was inhibited by Ad.ASbFGF in a dose-dependent fashion (panel A) and could be prevented by exogenous bFGF (panel B). In order to distinguish between an inhibition of proliferation and promotion of cell death, quiescent smooth muscle cells were infected with the antisense bFGF virus and maintained in low (0.5%) serum. The number of antisense-infected cells decreased in a dose-dependent fashion (panel C), indicating cell death, which was subsequently identified as apoptosis by accepted morphologic and biochemical criteria.Figure 2:Antisense inhibition of endogenous bFGF synthesis provokes cell death in either high or low serum, which can be prevented by exogenous bFGF. Antisense inhibition of bFGF expression reduces the accumulation of cells cultured in 10% FBS (A). Cells were infected with Ad.CMVlacZ at an MOI = 1000 (open squares), or Ad.ASbFGF at an MOI = 50 (filled diamonds), 100 (filled triangles), or 1000 (filled circles) and maintained in 10% FBS. Cells were counted daily starting on the day after infection; individual data points in this and each of the experiments in this figure represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate wells, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. For the bFGF rescue experiment (B), cells were infected with Ad.CMVlacZ or Ad.ASbFGF at an MOI = 100; bFGF was added daily starting 1 day following infection, and cell counts were monitored. Cells infected with Ad.CMVlacZ and cultured in the absence (open squares), or presence (open circles) of bFGF were compared with cells infected with Ad.ASbFGF in the absence (filled squares) or presence (filled circles) of bFGF. To distinguish between inhibition of proliferation and promotion of cell death, cells were cultured in 0.5% serum to maintain quiescence both prior to and following infection with recombinant adenoviruses (C). Cells were infected with either Ad5/RSV/GL2 at an MOI = 1000 (open squares) or with Ad.ASbFGF at an MOI = 100 (filled triangles) or 1000 (filled circles), and cell counts were monitored daily.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells infected with the antisense bFGF virus appeared normal for the first 24 h, but thereafter alterations in cellular and nuclear morphology and evidence of DNA fragmentation were observed (Fig. 3). Cells became rounded, developed vesiculations around the cell borders (panels A and B), and displayed condensation of nuclear chromatin, nuclear fragmentation (panels C and D), and evidence of DNA strand breaks (panels E-H). Agarose gel electrophoresis of the low molecular weight DNA (soluble cytoplasmic fraction) isolated from equal numbers of smooth muscle cells showed prominent oligonucleosomal fragmentation in Ad.ASbFGF-infected cells, which was barely detectable in control virus-infected cells and was undetectable in uninfected cells (Fig. 4). Nonspecific viral toxicity as a cause of cell death was excluded by the normal appearance of cells infected with similar doses of control viruses, in contrast to the rapid killing of cells (<12 h) intentionally infected at a very high multiplicities of infection, which was characterized by cell swelling and lysis. The delay of >24 h between infection with Ad.ASbFGF and the appearance of apoptosis suggests that cells are initially protected by existing bFGF protein and that the content of bFGF must fall below a critical level before apoptosis is initiated.Figure 4:Antisense inhibition of bFGF expression induces oligonucleosomal fragmentation.

Apoptosis triggered by antisense inhibition of bFGF production might resemble a growth factor withdrawal model if it could be prevented by heterologous growth factor signaling pathways(43.Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it might conform to the second type of apoptotic mechanism involving inappropriate S phase entry. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the ability of a different growth factor to prevent apoptosis following infection with Ad.ASbFGF was assessed, and the degree of S phase entry was estimated by flow cytometry, rates of DNA synthesis, and BrdU labeling of apoptotic nuclei in Ad.ASbFGF-infected cells. EGF, similar to exogenous bFGF, was able to prevent the reduction in the number of Ad.ASbFGF-infected cells over time in either high or low serum (data not shown). However, the ability of added growth factors to prevent the reduced accumulation of cells over time does not distinguish between the prevention of cell death and the stimulation of proliferation in the surviving cells. In order to make this distinction, the extent of apoptosis in the presence or absence of growth factors was assessed by the percentage of apoptotic nuclei visualized by propidium iodide staining. In cells cultured in 0.5% FBS in the absence of growth factors and infected at an MOI of 1000 with either Ad.ASbFGF or control virus, the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in control virus-infected cells was 0.5 ± 0.5% (mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples) compared with 18.9 ± 4.4% in Ad.ASbFGF-infected cells, which was also associated with a 20% decrease in cell number. In Ad.ASbFGF-infected cells treated with bFGF, the percentage of apoptotic nuclei was only 8 ± 1.1% compared with 15.5 ± 4.7% in cells treated with EGF, despite a similar (2-fold) increase in cell number stimulated by either growth factor in both control virus- or Ad.ASbFGF-infected cells. These data show that despite a similar stimulation of proliferation in non-apoptotic cells, bFGF but not EGF was able to reduce the proportion of apoptotic cells. This result suggests that apoptosis triggered by inhibition of autocrine bFGF synthesis does not correspond to a growth factor withdrawal model of apoptosis or that it involves signaling pathways that are not shared by bFGF and EGF. An alternative hypothesis, that apoptosis triggered by inhibition of autocrine bFGF synthesis involves disruption of normal cell cycle regulation, was tested by examining several complementary measures of cell cycle activity. Analysis of cell cycle activity in Ad.ASbFGF- versus control virus-infected smooth muscle cells suggested that an inappropriate entry into S phase participates in the mechanism of apoptosis due to inhibition of autocrine bFGF synthesis. By flow cytometric analysis, Ad.ASbFGF-infected cells displayed a marked increase in the proportion of cells in S phase at the expense of the G0/G1 population (Fig. 5), and a time course experim"

https://openalex.org/W2035415315,"The mouse mammary tumor virus promoter has been shown to be inducible by glucocorticoids and progesterone. Although steroid hormone receptors bind with high affinity to palindromic response elements, the hormone-responsive region of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter contains a pair of directly repeated half-sites that are important for hormone inducibility. Recent experiments have also indicated that direct repeats can function as estrogen response elements. Here, we have investigated DNA binding by steroid receptors to direct repeats and provide evidence using gel retardation assays, methylation interference, and gene transfer experiments that direct repeats of TGTTCT or RGGTCA motifs function as response elements for glucocorticoid (GR) or estrogen receptors (ER), respectively, by binding receptor homodimers. Specific GR- or ER-DNA complexes were observed on direct repeats with different spacings between half-sites, indicating that binding of steroid receptors to direct repeats is more flexible than binding to palindromic elements. This flexibility was further emphasized by the observation that the GR could also bind to everted repeats of TGTTCT motifs separated by 9 base pairs. The isolated DNA binding domains of the GR and ER bound cooperatively to palindromes, but no evidence was observed for cooperative binding to direct repeats. Under similar conditions the DNA binding domains of retinoid receptors retinoid X receptor and retinoic acid receptor bound to direct repeats cooperatively as heterodimers. Similarly, ER derivative HE15, which lacks a functional ligand binding domain, bound palindromic response elements but failed to bind direct repeats. These results indicate that the dimerization domain in the ligand binding domain is essential for binding of steroid receptors to direct repeats and that the dimerization domain in the D-box of the DNA binding is not functional under these conditions. Moreover, the results suggest that steroid receptor DNA binding domains may lack dimerization domains outside the D-box, which would function in binding to direct repeats, in contrast to receptors for retinoids and thyroid hormone. A comparison of the mechanisms of binding of steroid receptors and retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors to direct repeats is presented."

Vascular plants thus have a very high Phe/Tyr turnover, since ∼30-40% of all assimilated carbon in photosynthesis is of phenylpropanoid/phenylpropanoid-acetate origin(1.Floss H.G. Recent Adv.

Scrutiny of the prearomatic pathway, leading to Phe/Tyr, and subsequent phenylpropanoid/phenylpropanoid-acetate metabolism reveals some noteworthy features. First, prephenate accepts an amino group from glutamate via transamination, constituting the point whereby nitrogen is introduced(9.Byng G. Whitaker R. Flick C. Je nsen R.A. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 1289Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10.Connelly J.A. Conn E.E. Z. Naturforsch. Biosci. 1986; 41: 69Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11.Gaines C.G. Byng G.S.

Second, when Phe/Tyr are committed to phenylpropanoid metabolism, rather than to protein or alkaloid synthesis, nitrogen (as the ammonium ion) is immediately removed via the appropriate lyase reaction (16.Hanson K.R. Havir E.A. Conn E.E. Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 577-625Google Scholar, 17.Koukol J. Conn E.E. J. Biol.

Consequently, an efficient means of nitrogen recycling must exist within cells undergoing active phenylpropanoid metabolism, otherwise severe nitrogen deficiency would result. A possible mechanism for recycling is shown in Fig. S2, where the ammonium ion released during lysis is metabolized via glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase to generate glutamate(19.Lea P.J.

Chemical shifts are quoted relative to the 15NH4+ resonance at 0 ppm obtained using 15NH4Cl (100 mM) as an external standard.

HPLC was performed on a Waters model 600E system controller, fitted with a Waters Ultra Wisp model 717 sample processor, and a photodiode array detector (Waters model 996) equipped with a NEC Power Mate 2 personal computer. HPLC separations were carried out using a Pico-Tag column (3.9 × 300 mm), with detection at 254 nm, using the procedure of Hagen et al.(33.Hagen S.R. Augustin J. Grings E. Tassinari P. Food Chem. 1993; 46: 319Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The eluent system consisted of two solvent systems: eluent 1, 975 ml of 0.07 N sodium acetate, titrated to pH 6.5 with glacial acetic acid, and mixed with 25 ml of acetonitrile; and eluent 2, 450 ml of acetonitrile, 150 ml of methanol, and 400 ml of Milli-Q water measured separately and then mixed. Elution was carried out in several steps at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 as follows: 100% eluent 1 to 13.5 min; 13.5 min, step to eluents 1:2 (97:3); 13.5-24 min, concave curve (Waters no. 8) to eluents 1:2 (94:6); 24-30 min, convex curve (Waters no. 5) to eluents 1:2 (91:9); 30-50 min, linear change to eluents 1:2 (66:34); 50-62 min, and held at this condition; 62-62.5 min, linear change to 100% eluent 2; 62.5-66.5 min, held at 100% eluent 2; 66.5-67 min, linear change to 100% eluent 1; 67-87 min, held at 100% eluent 1. The total run time between injections including column reequilibration was 87 min. Quantitation of the Phe, Gln, and Glu pools in the different amino acid samples was made from calibration curves obtained from derivatizing and analyzing known amounts of each amino acid. GC-MS was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5989A GC-MS system operating in the EI-mode. All separations were performed on a 15 m × 0.25-mm (internal diameter) DB-5MS column (0.25-μm filter), with helium as a carrier gas at 5 p.s.i. The source temperature was 250°C, and the injector and interface temperatures were at 275°C, with an electron multiplier voltage of 2200 V for all applications. For analysis of the N-DMTBS amino acid samples, the oven temperature program was raised from 175°C (5 min) to 275°C at 10°C/min and then held for 12.5 min. The mass range scanned was 50-650 atomic mass units for electron ionization studies. The specific isotopic abundance of Phe, Gln, and Glu was determined by plotting extracted ion current profiles and calculating ratios from the following ion clusters: Phe (14N:15N, 336:337); Gln (14N14N: 14N15N:15N15N, 431:432:433); and Glu (14N:15N, 432:433). The following equations for specific isotopic calculations (isotope = I) were used to substract the contribution of natural abundance 15N, 13C, 2H, 17O, 18O, 29Si, and 30Si as follows (34.McLafferty F.W.

In vivo15N-labeling was performed by subculturing 7-day old, 2,4-D treated P. taeda cells (2.5-ml packed cell volume in 25 ml of medium) with a sterile 8% sucrose medium supplemented with the individual 15N-labeled substrates, in the presence or absence of selected inhibitors(35.Amrhein N. Godeke K. Plant Sci. Lett. 1977; 8: 313Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36.Miflin B.J. Lea P.J. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 403Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37.Ronzio R.A. Rowe W.B. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). 15N-Phe, 15NH4Cl, 15N-Gln, and 15N-Glu were administered at a final concentration of 10 mM at t = 0 h. For inhibitor studies, L-AOPP was administered at a final concentration of 0.1 mM at t = 0 h, whereas MSO and AZA were at 5 mM. In each experiment, the cells were incubated at 25°C, over a time course of 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, on a Lab-Line (Melrose Park, IL) model 3520 orbital shaker (105 rpm) under continuous light provided by two fluorescent lights (40-watt, Philips, Cool White, 25-45 μmol s−1m−1). Following each incubation, suspension culture cells were harvested by filtration of medium on Miracloth, washed with distilled H2O (50 ml), weighed, frozen (liquid N2), and stored at −80°C until needed. Frozen cells were ground in a chilled mortar, extracted with cold EtOH (5 ml), with the resulting slurry transferred, by means of two rinses (3 ml of 95% EtOH each) into a conical tube. The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 10 min (2,200 g, 4°C) in a Beckman model TJ-6 centrifuge, the supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was collected, then resuspended in 95% EtOH (3 ml) and centrifuged for 10 min as before (two times). Supernatants were combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 30°C to give the crude amino acid extracts. The dried amino acid extracts were individually resuspended in distilled H2O (5 ml) and extracted with CHCl3 (5 ml). The resulting aqueous phase from each experiment was vigorously agitated using a vortex mixer, centrifuged for 10 min (2,200 g, 4°C), with the supernatant frozen (liquid N2) and lyophilized. Each dry amino acid sample was dissolved in 0.1 N HCl (1 ml), containing D2O (50 μl), and subjected to NMR spectroscopic analysis. Each amino acid extract (initially used for 15N NMR analyses) was next derivatized, using the MTBSTFA (38.Rhodes D. Rich P.J. Brunk D.G. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Pico-Tag (39.Razal R.A. Lewis N.G. Towers G.H.N. Phytochem. Anal. 1994; 5: 98Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) methods described previously, with the resulting N-DMTBS and phenylisothiocyanate derivatives analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC, respectively. The apparent metabolic fate of the ammonium ion released during metabolism of 15N-Phe was examined, under conditions where cells were undergoing active lignin synthesis. Thus, 10 mM15N-Phe (99.9 atom %15N) was administered to lignifying P. taeda cell cultures, these then being allowed to metabolize over a 4-day period, with cells removed at 24-h intervals for 15N NMR spectroscopic analyses. At t = 24 h, three clearly resolved signals (data not shown) were observed at δ 91.1, 18.3, and 16.7 ppm. These resonances were assigned to the δ-amide nitrogen of Gln, α-nitrogen atoms of Gln and Glu, and the amino group of Phe, respectively, based on chemical shifts of authentic standards and previously published data(24.Thorpe T.A. Bagh K. Cutler A.J. Dunstan D.I. McIntyre D.D. Vogel H.J. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Altenburger R. Abarzua S. Callies R. Grimme L.H. Mayer A. Leibfritz D. Arch.

Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 509Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). By 96 h, additional resonances at δ 19.9 and 13.2 ppm were also evident (Fig. 1A); these were attributed to alanine and serine as previously assigned in nitrogen metabolism studies with white spruce (Picea glauca) buds(24.Thorpe T.A. Bagh K. Cutler A.J. Dunstan D.I. McIntyre D.D. Vogel H.J. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, no resonances at any stage corresponding to 15NH4+ were observed, in accordance with earlier observations, such as with potato (Solanum tuberosum) slices, where it did not reach detectable levels (7.Razal R.A. Ellis S. Singh S. Lewis N.G. Towers G.H.N. Phytochemistry. 1996; 41: 31Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) during active phenylpropanoid-glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase metabolism. Subsequent GC-MS and HPLC analyses of the extracts confirmed and extended these observations (see Table 1). Thus, both isotopic enrichment and total amounts (micrograms/g fresh weight) of each principal metabolite (Gln and Glu) were determined, following incubation of 15N-Phe (99.9 atom %, 10 mM) with P. taeda cell cultures, for periods up to 96 h. As can be seen, the phenylalanine present in the soluble pool in the cells was ∼90 atom %15N-enriched at all intervals sampled (24, 48, 72, and 96 h). But its amount decreased from ∼677 μg/gfw (t = 24 h) to ∼25 μg/gfw (t = 96 h) as a result of the utilization of its carbon skeleton for phenylpropanoid metabolism. However, the Gln/Glu pools were enriched by only ∼43-53 atom %15N, with both nitrogens of Gln labeled in relatively equal amount. In contrast to that of Phe pool sizes, the relative amounts (micrograms/gfw) of Gln/Glu dropped by only about 50% over the duration of the 96-h experiment.Tabled 1 To prove unambiguously that the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway was assimilating the ammonium ion released during lignification, incubations of 10 mM15N-Phe (99.9 atom %15N) were repeated, but now in the presence of specific inhibitors of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase, respectively. Thus, when incubations were conducted with lignifying P. taeda cell cultures in the presence of 0.1 mML-AOPP(35.Amrhein N. Godeke K. Plant Sci. Lett. 1977; 8: 313Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a known PAL inhibitor, the major resonance now observed was that of unmetabolized 15N-Phe (Fig. 1B). Small resonances were also noted at δ 18.3 ppm, suggesting that phenylpropanoid metabolism was not completely inhibited by L-AOPP, in accordance with previous observations(35.Amrhein N. Godeke K. Plant Sci. Lett. 1977; 8: 313Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 40.Maxwell C.A. Phillips D.A. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by quantitative measurements which revealed that the amounts of Phe (∼90%15N enriched) remained essentially constant (2926-2105 μg/gfw) throughout the 96-h duration of the experiment. Indeed, the employment of L-AOPP resulted in considerable PAL inhibition as evidenced by the 4- to 100-fold increase in Phe levels over the 24-96-h time frame examined (cf.Table 1, Phe with and without L-AOPP). But PAL was not inhibited fully, as revealed by the small isotopic enhancement of both Gln (19-20%) and Glu (22-25%), respectively (Table 1). Nevertheless, these results clearly showed that overall PAL inhibition by L-AOPP adversely affected metabolic flux into Gln/Glu. Interestingly, it had little effect upon the pool sizes of each amino acid relative to that observed previously during active lignification. The effects of treating lignifying P. taeda cell cultures with 5 mM MSO(36.Miflin B.J. Lea P.J. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 403Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a glutamine synthase inhibitor, was investigated. The results in Fig. 1C show only resonances corresponding to 15N-Phe and 15NH4+ at δ 16.7 and 0.0 ppm; signals due to either 15N-Gln, 15N-Glu, 15N-Ala, and 15N-Ser were absent, indicating that their metabolism from 15N-Phe was now inhibited. Quantification of both isotopic enrichment and total amounts (micrograms/g fresh weight) supported this conclusion (Table 1). The levels of 15N-Phe (∼90 atom %15N) rapidly decreased from ∼2492 μg/gfw (at 24 h) down to ∼34 μg/gfw within 96 h, due to the action of PAL. However, as suggested by the NH4+ resonance at 0.0 ppm, no significant incorporation into 15N-Gln occurred, as confirmed from its low isotopic enrichment (2-3%). Glutamine synthase inhibition had no apparent effect on the relative pool sizes of Glu which again remained comparable to those previously noted, although, by contrast, the Gln levels dropped to being near undetectable. Interestingly, the Glu isolated was ∼5-10% enriched, perhaps suggesting that a small amount of Glu formation might occur via transamination of Phe, as suggested earlier(41.Wightman F. Forest J.C. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 1455Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In summary, this experiment revealed that inhibition of glutamine synthase prevented an effective assimilation of 15NH4+, released during Phe deamination, into either Gln, Glu, or any other amino acid. The effects of treating lignifying P. taeda cells with 15N-Phe, in the presence of AZA(37.Ronzio R.A. Rowe W.B. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of glutamate synthase, was also examined. The results, illustrated in Fig. 1D, show that the predominant resonances were due to 15N-Phe and 15N-Gln (δ-amide), with only a very small signal at δ 18.3 ppm, due to either H2N-15N-Gln, or 15N-Glu if incomplete inhibition occurred. This interpretation was confirmed by quantification, as shown in Table 1; azaserine treatment had little effect upon carbon metabolism into cinnamate, as evidenced by rapid depletion of Phe from ∼1162 to 70 μg/g fresh weight over the 96-h duration. Glutamine levels were now higher (315-120 μg/gfw) than previously noted, due to glutamate synthase inhibition, with the 15N-Gln essentially being only singly labeled (at the δ-amide-nitrogen); this established that further cycling of the nitrogen through glutamate synthase to ultimately afford the corresponding (15N,15N) double-labeled species was greatly reduced. Significantly, the effect of AZA on Glu levels resulted in a 4-9-fold depletion from previous levels. Taken together, these results indicated that the primary metabolic fate of the nitrogen of Phe, following its release as ammonium ion during active phenylpropanoid metabolism, was sequential assimilation into glutamine and then glutamate. There was no evidence for ammonium ion assimilation by glutamine dehydrogenase, since in the presence of either MSO or AZA, neither of which inhibits glutamine dehydrogenase, essentially no detectable incorporation of 15NH4+ into Glu occurred. While the above experiments provided convincing evidence for the metabolic sequence 15N-Phe →15NH4+→15N(δ-amide)-Gln →15N -Glu, they did not establish that the ammonium ion, liberated during deamination, was recycled back to Phe during active phenylpropanoid metabolism. Consequently, the fate of exogenously provided 15NH4Cl, 15N(δ-amide)-Gln, and 15N-Glu to lignifying P. taeda cell cultures was next investigated, to ascertain whether Phe would accumulate in a 15N-enriched form. Experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of the PAL inhibitor, L-AOPP, as before. P. taeda cell cultures were first administered 10 mM15NH4Cl for 96 h, with samples removed at 24-h intervals and analyzed. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, 15N NMR spectroscopic analyses of the extracts were devoid of any signal corresponding to 15N-Phe. Instead, a range of resonances attributed to 15N-Gln, 15N-Glu, 15NH4Cl, the δ and ω,ω‘ nitrogens of arginine (δ 66.8 and 53.4 ppm), 15N-Ser, the α-nitrogen of proline (δ 32.4 ppm), and the side chain amino groups of Lys (∊), Orn (δ), and γ-aminobutyric acid at δ 11.7 ppm were evident. Thus, when an ammonium source, such as NH4Cl, was administered to lignifying P. taeda cell cultures, it was made available to general pools for amino acid/protein synthesis, i.e. its fate differed from that of 15N-Phe-derived ammonium ion which resulted in the enhancement of 15N signals only in Glu, Gln, Ala, and Ser. This strongly suggests that the ammonium ion generated during lignin synthesis is tightly compartmentalized, and not made available for general amino acid metabolism/protein synthesis. Interestingly, as can be seen from Table 2, administration of 15NH4Cl (10 mM) to the lignifying P. taeda cell cultures resulted in a rapid 6-fold increase in Gln levels (495 μg/gfw) followed by its gradual decline to ∼98 μg/gfw over 96 h, with both nitrogens being enriched (79-52%). This was expected since an increased availability of NH4+ stimulates glutamine synthetase, with a concomitant increase in Gln accumulation(42.Rhodes D. Rendon G.A. Stewart G.R. Planta. 1975; 125: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 43.Rhodes D. Rendon G.A. Stewart G.R. Planta. 1976; 129: 203Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By contrast, both the amount and isotopic enrichment of Glu were only slightly elevated over previous levels (see Table 1). As before, the 15N-Phe pool size was very small, although significantly it was now partially enriched (19-37%15N), thus providing the first hint of evidence in support of the proposed phenylpropanoid-nitrogen cycle.Tabled 1 Incubation of the lignifying P. taeda cell cultures with 15NH4Cl (10 mM), in the presence of L-AOPP (0.1 mM), was next carried out. As can be seen in Fig. 2B and Table 2, the most notable feature was the steady growth of 15N-Phe (201-1301 μg/gfw), this ultimately resulting in the dominant signal (at δ 16.7 ppm) in the NMR spectrum. Additionally, all three metabolites, Glu (48-70%15N), Phe (51-64%15N), and Gln (68-89% total 15N) were isotopically enriched. Thus, proof that NH4Cl was normally destined for the phenylpropanoid pathway was in hand. Existence of this phenylpropanoid-nitrogen cycle was proven further by incubating the lignifying cells with 15N(δ)-Gln (10 mM) and 15N-Glu (10 mM), respectively, in the presence and absence of L-AOPP (0.1 mM). As noted previously for 15NH4Cl metabolism, administration of 15N(δ)-Gln (10 mM) did not result in any resonance corresponding to 15N-Phe at any time points examined. Only signals due to 15N-Gln and 15N-Glu were evident by 24 h (data not shown), with prolonged incubation (72-96 h) resulting in additional resonances for 15N-Ala, 15N-Ser, and 15N-Asn (Fig. 3A), respectively. (The 15N-Asn resonance was not unexpected, since the Gln pool can serve as amino donor to aspartate, which in turn undergoes transamination to give Asn-amino N; hence it is also assumed that the resonance at δ 18.3 ppm contains a minor contribution due to Asp(α) and Asn(α) (43.Rhodes D. Rendon G.A. Stewart G.R. Planta. 1976; 129: 203Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).) Determination of pool sizes and isotopic enrichment as before verified that Phe concentrations were low (7-13 μg/gfw) but enriched (23-28%15N), whereas 15N-Gln and 15N-Glu levels remained fairly constant (cf.15NH4Cl metabolism); note also that the isotopic enrichments of both were lower than before, with the 15N-Gln being predominantly singly labeled. In a somewhat analogous manner, administration of 15N-Glu (10 mM) to P. taeda cell cultures, gave amino acid extracts devoid of 15N-Phe resonances at any of the sampling points, whereas signals due to 15N-Glu, 15N-Ala, 15N-Ser, and 15N-Pro were readily detected (Fig. 4A). This was further verified by quantification which again revealed a small Phe pool size (6-10 μg/gfw of 42-47%15N enrichment) (Table 2). On the other hand, when P. taeda cells were incubated with 15N(δ)-Gln and 15N-Glu in the presence of 0.1 mML-AOPP, resonances due to L-Phe (δ 16.7 ppm) were now readily evident (Fig. 3B and 4B). This was further proven by quantification which revealed a ∼100-fold increase in its amount (∼1012-1074 μg/gfw from 72-96-h duration) with an isotopic enrichment of 29-75%15N, i.e. again confirming the proposed phenylpropanoid-nitrogen cycle. Resonances due to 15N-Gln, 15N-Glu, 15N-Ala, and 15N-Ser were also observed, as well as minor signals due to 15N Pro, Lys, Orn, and γ-aminobutyric acid. Moreover, although Gln pool sizes were close to those previously noted (Table 2), there was a significant increase in the extent of formation of double-labeled 15N-Gln. This is presumed to result via limited catabolism of Glu to ammonium ion and 2-oxoglutarate, with subsequent reassimilation by glutamine synthetase to yield 15N(α),15N(δ)-Gln. With the combined use of HPLC, 15N NMR, and GC-MS, the mechanism for recycling of ammonia during phenylpropanoid metabolism in lignifying P. taeda (loblolly pine) cell cultures was unambiguously established. The use of enzyme inhibitors was necessary to elucidate this mechanism, with metabolite accumulations being consistent with the known mode of action of L-AOPP, MSO, and AZA; namely inhibition of PAL, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase, respectively. The ammonium ion generated during active phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is first incorporated into the δ-amide of glutamine, followed in turn by the α-amino position of glutamate, which then acts as an amino donor for a range of transamination products, including the aromatic amino acids, arogenate, and phenylalanine. This nitrogen cycle explains how optimum use is made of the plant's available nitrogen, so that active phenylpropanoid metabolism and lignification can continue, even at low nitrogen levels. Thanks are extended to Dr. W. F. Siems for the GC-MS determinations, and to K. Sikes for maintenance of the P. taeda cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1989531728,"In Bacillus subtilis, expression of the tryptophan biosynthetic genes is regulated in response to tryptophan by an RNA-binding protein called TRAP (trp RNA-binding attenuation protein). TRAP has been shown to contain 11 identical subunits arranged in a symmetrical ring. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between tryptophan-activated TRAP and trp leader RNA were studied. Results from glycerol gradients and mobility shift gels indicate that two TRAP 11-mers bind to each trp leader RNA. A filter binding assay was used to determine an apparent binding constant of 8.0 ± 1.3 × 109M-1 (Kd = 0.12 ± 0.02 nM) for TRAP and an RNA containing residues +36 to +92 of the trp leader RNA in 1 mML-tryptophan at 37°C. The temperature dependence of Kapp was somewhat unexpected demonstrating that the ΔH of the interaction is highly unfavorable at +15.9 kcal mol-1. Therefore, the interaction is completely driven by a ΔS of +97 cal mol-1 K-1. The interaction between tryptophan-activated TRAP and trp leader RNA displayed broad salt and pH activity profiles. Finally, the rate of RNA dissociation from the RNA•TRAP•tryptophan ternary complex was found to be very slow in high concentrations of tryptophan (>40 μM) but increased in lower tryptophan concentrations.

In Bacillus subtilis, the genes for tryptophan biosynthesis are regulated in response to tryptophan by an RNA-binding protein called TRAP (trp RNA-binding attenuation protein; (1.Shimotsu H.

TRAP regulates expression of the trp genes in three ways, all of which involve TRAP binding RNA in a tryptophan-dependent manner(3.Gollinck P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The trp operon (trpEDCFBA), which contains 6 of the 7 genes required for L-tryptophan biosynthesis, is regulated by transcription attenuation within a 204-nucleotide leader region preceding the first structural gene, trpE(1.Shimotsu H. Kuroda M. Yanofsky C. Henner D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 461-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kuroda M. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of L-tryptophan, TRAP binds the nascent trp leader transcript (4.Otridge P. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) at a series of 11 G/UAG repeats between residues +36 and +91 (Fig. 1; (5.Babitzke P. Stults P. Shire S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Antson A. Otridge J. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Wilson F.K. Smith T. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P.

A. 1995; 92: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). This binding prevents formation of an anti-terminator secondary structure which allows a transcription terminator to form and transcription halts in the leader region(1.Shimotsu H. Kuroda M. Yanofsky C. Henner D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 461-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When L-tryptophan is limiting, TRAP does not bind, the anti-terminator forms, and the operon is expressed. TRAP also regulates translation of two trp genes, trpE (2.Kuroda M. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and trpG(10.Yang M. Saizieu A. Loon A. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4272-4278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apparently by two different mechanisms. Control of trpE translation is believed to be mediated by TRAP binding to the same series of G/UAG repeats in the leader segment of trp mRNAs that have escaped termination at the attenuator. This binding is thought to alter the RNA secondary structure so as to sequester the trpE ribosome binding site in a stem-loop structure, thus reducing translation initiation(2.Kuroda M. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). trpG is the only tryptophan biosynthetic gene not located within the trp operon and is located within a folic acid biosynthetic operon(11.Slock J. Stahly D.P. Han C.-Y. Six E.W. Crawford I.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7211-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of trpG translation occurs when TRAP binds a series of nine trinucleotide repeats which overlaps the putative ribosome binding site of trpG(5.Babitzke P. Stults P. Shire S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yang M. Saizieu A. Loon A. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4272-4278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of control is not yet known, the data are consistent with a model involving direct competition between tryptophan-activated TRAP and ribosomes for trpG mRNA. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of TRAP complexed with L-tryptophan has been solved by x-ray crystallography and refined to 1.8-Å resolution(6.Antson A. Otridge J. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Wilson F.K. Smith T. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12.Antson A. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dauter Z. Wilson K. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TRAP is an endecamer, with the 11 identical subunits arranged in a symmetrical ring. The secondary structure of TRAP is formed entirely of β-sheets, β-turns, and random coils; no α-helices are present. TRAP is activated to bind trp leader RNA by binding 11 molecules of L-tryptophan in a highly cooperative manner(6.Antson A. Otridge J. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Wilson F.K. Smith T. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The crystal structure reveals that each tryptophan molecule binds between two loops contributed by adjacent subunits; these loops contain residues 25-33 of one subunit and residues 49-52 of the other (6.Antson A. Otridge J. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Wilson F.K. Smith T. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Based on the structure of the TRAP endecamer and the multiple trinucleotide repeats in its RNA targets, we have proposed that upon binding, the RNA wraps around the protein such that each G/UAG repeat interacts with one subunit or a combination of two adjacent subunits of the TRAP 11-mer(6.Antson A. Otridge J. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Wilson F.K. Smith T. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). By wrapping around the protein, trp leader RNA would bind TRAP in a manner different from that observed in other characterized RNA-protein interactions(13.Draper D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Moreover, TRAP contains no sequences with similarity to other characterized RNA-binding motifs(14.Burd C. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Given the novel structure of TRAP and its RNA target, as well as the unusual manner by which tryptophan-activated TRAP is believed to bind trp leader RNA, it was of interest to examine the stoichiometry and thermodynamics of this interaction. Our results show that the activated form of TRAP binds trp leader RNA with a stoichiometry of two TRAP 11-mers to each RNA and an apparent binding constant of 8.0 ± 1.3 × 109M-1 (Kd = 0.12 ± 0.02 nM). The free energy of interaction is driven by a large favorable change in entropy (ΔS = +97 cal mol-1 K-1) which is necessary to compensate for the substantial unfavorable change in enthalpy (ΔH = +15.9 kcal mol-1). The lack of any significant salt dependence of the TRAP-RNA interaction (-δlog Kapp/δlog [K+] ≈ 0) indicates that electrostatic contacts do not play a major role in the stability of the complex and that the release of ions upon complex formation is not the major source of the favorable change in entropy. Previous work demonstrated that in the presence of excess tryptophan, the RNA in the tryptophan•TRAP•RNA ternary complex shows no significant dissociation after 30 min(5.Babitzke P. Stults P. Shire S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Babitzke P. Bear D. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since TRAP functions as a regulatory protein by binding transcripts produced from the apparently unregulated trp promoter(1.Shimotsu H. Kuroda M. Yanofsky C. Henner D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 461-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that in vivo, the tryptophan•TRAP•RNA complex is this stable. To address this apparent paradox, we have studied the rate of RNA dissociation from the RNA•TRAP•tryptophan ternary complex as a function of tryptophan concentration and have shown that the rate of dissociation of the ternary complex increases rapidly as the concentration of L-tryptophan is lowered. Plasmid pTZ18U14-92 contains residues +14 to +92 of the trp leader region (Fig. 1; (1.Shimotsu H. Kuroda M. Yanofsky C. Henner D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 461-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) cloned downstream of the T7 promoter. It was constructed using polymerase chain reaction with pSPORTtrpL138 (4.Otridge P. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as a template and primers trpL15 (5′-GCGAATTCAAGAGTGTGTATAAAGCAAT-3′) and trpL92 (5′-AGAAGCTTCTCAGCTCAACTAAACTCA-3′) complementary to residues +14 to +35 and to +92 to +73 of the trp leader DNA, respectively. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into similarly cut pTZ18U (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Plasmid pTZ18U36-92 was constructed in a similar manner except that primer trpL36 (5′-GCGAATTCTAGAATGAGTTGAGTTAGAG-3′) was used to create the 5′ end of the construct starting at position +36 of the trp leader DNA. 32P-Labeled trp leader RNA was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and HindIII linearized templates as described previously(4.Otridge P. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For filter binding experiments, plasmid pTZ18U36-92 was used as the transcription template to generate RNA 36-92. Transcription reactions contained 500 pmol of unlabeled UTP and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) yielding a final specific activity of 186 Ci/mmol UTP. Since RNA 36-92 contains 15 U's, the transcript had a final specific activity of 2790 Ci/mmol. Similarly, for stoichiometry experiments, plasmid pTZ18U14-92 or pTZ18U36-92 was transcribed in the presence 0.6 Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP to produce RNA 14-92 or RNA 36-92 with a specific activity of 12 Ci/mmol RNA 14-92 (20 U's/transcript) or 9 Ci/mmol RNA 36-92 (15 U's/transcript), respectively. All RNAs were purified on 10% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels and extracted by a crush and soak protocol(15.Milligan J. Uhlenbeck O. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2849-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TRAP was purified as described previously(12.Antson A. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dauter Z. Wilson K. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TRAP labeled with [35S]methionine was prepared in vivo using a modification of the T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system(16.Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). Two 500-ml cultures of SG62052/pGP12 Escherichia coli cells (16.Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) transformed with pTZ18UmtrB(4.Otridge P. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 30°C. Upon reaching an A590 of 0.5, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 500 ml of M9 medium(17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each pellet was then resuspended in 1 liter of M9 medium (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 20 μg/ml thiamine, and 18 amino acids (0.01%; minus cysteine and methionine). Cells were grown for 1 h at 30°C and then heat shocked at 42°C for 30 min. 200 μg/ml rifampicin and 10 mCi of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) were added and the cells were grown an additional hour at 37°C before harvesting by centrifugation. Following two washes with M9 medium, 35S-labeled TRAP was purified by chromatography on phenyl-agarose as described previously(12.Antson A. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dauter Z. Wilson K. Kurecki T. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentration of 35S-TRAP was determined spectrophotometrically to be 0.6 μg/μl based on the extinction coefficient of 1280 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm, which was predicted by computer analysis (18.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) and confirmed by amino acid analysis(19.Hoffman R. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of labeled TRAP was confirmed using two different colormetric assays (BCA, Pierce; Bradford, Bio-Rad) using purified, unlabeled TRAP as the standard. Based on these colormetric assays, the concentration of labeled TRAP was 0.58 ± 0.03 μg/μl and when averaged with the value obtained spectrophotometrically, a value of 0.59 μg/μl was used as the concentration of labeled protein. The specific activity of the 35S-labeled TRAP was determined by counting a known quantity of the labeled TRAP in scintillation mixture (Ecoscint, National Diagnostics). For standard filter binding reactions, various concentrations of TRAP were equilibrated with 1 mML-tryptophan at room temperature (23°C) in a total volume of 95 μl of FBB (250 mM potassium glutamate, 16 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 4 mM MgCl2). After 5 min, 5 μl containing 1 fmol of RNA 36-92 (1 × 104 dpm) and 10 μg of yeast tRNA were added and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for an additional 15 min. 50-μl aliquots were then removed and filtered through a 0.45-μM cellulose nitrate membrane (Micro Filtration Systems) under vacuum. The filters were washed twice with 200 μl of FBB, dried, and counted in a Beckmann scintillation counter. Experiments at pH 5 and 6 were done in MES ( §Current address: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institute of Health, Genetics and Biochemistry Branch, 10 Center Dr., MSC1766, Bethesda, MD 20892-1766.) buffer, those at pH 8 were done in HEPES, and those at pH 10 were done in CAPS. The pH of all buffers was adjusted with either HCl or KOH. For dissociation rate experiments, 0.8 nM TRAP was equilibrated with 40 μML-tryptophan for 5 min at room temperature in FBB. Then, 4 fmol of RNA 36-92 (4 × 105 dpm) were added to a total volume of 25 μl and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. 975 μl of FBB containing various amounts of L-tryptophan were then added to yield final concentrations of L-tryptophan between 1 and 10.75 μM. 75-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated time points, filtered, washed, and counted as described above. Velocity sedimentation gradients to determine the stoichiometry of the TRAP-trp leader RNA complex contained 5-30% glycerol in GB (250 mM potassium glutamate, 4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 12 mM HEPES pH 8, 4 mM MgCl2, and 1 mML-tryptophan) in a final volume of 12 ml. 500-μl reactions containing GB, 20 μg of yeast tRNA, 1 pmol of radiolabeled RNA, and/or the appropriate concentration of 35S-TRAP were incubated on ice for 10 min. Following this incubation, 200-μl samples were applied to the surface of the gradient and the gradients were spun 48 h at 35,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) at 4°C using slow acceleration, and deceleration without the brake. Gradients were collected from the bottom using a peristaltic pump at 13 ml/h. 360-μl fractions were collected and 200-μl aliquots were then counted in 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Ecoscint, National Diagnostics) and 1 ml of water. Two counting windows were used to measure the 35S and 32P in each aliquot. Window 1(0-688) contained 100% of the 35S and 33% of the 32P, whereas window 2(688-940) contained 67% of the 32P. The molar amounts of TRAP and RNA in each sample were calculated using the specific activities of TRAP and the RNA (see above). As an alternative method to separate the RNA•TRAP complex from the free forms of each, mobility shift gels were used. These gels were prepared and run as described previously (4.Otridge P. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) except N,N‘-bis-acrylylcystamine (Bio-Rad) was substituted for bisacrylamide as the cross-linker. Samples containing 1 pmol of 32P-labeled RNA 36-92 and the indicated concentration of 35S-labeled TRAP were incubated on ice for 10 min in FBB with 1 mM tryptophan and then loaded on the gel. Following separation, the gel was exposed to a phosphorstorage screen and developed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Bands containing the TRAP•RNA complex were excised from the gel and dissolved by incubation in 300 μl of 1 M dithiothreitol for 1 h with gentle shaking. 200-μl aliquots were then mixed with 10 ml of scintillation fluid and 1 ml of H2O and counted as described above for the velocity gradient fractions. Our model of the TRAP-trp leader RNA interaction, in which the bound RNA wraps around the protein (6.Antson A. Otridge J. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Wilson F.K. Smith T. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) suggests a 1:1 TRAP-RNA stoichiometry in the complex. The stoichiometry of the TRAP-RNA complex was analyzed by using either glycerol gradients or mobility shift gels to separate the complex from the free RNA and TRAP. In both cases, we used 35S-labeled TRAP and 32P-labeled RNA and determined the molar ratio of TRAP and RNA in the complex based on the specific activity of each species. The sedimentation profile of a glycerol gradient containing 5 pmol of 35S-labeled TRAP and 1 pmol of 32P-labeled RNA 14-92 is shown in Fig. 2. Nearly all of the RNA (Fig. 2, solid line, closed circles) was in fractions 14-19 which contained the TRAP•RNA complex, whereas TRAP (which was present in a 5-fold molar excess) was found in two peaks (Fig. 2, solid line, closed squares), one corresponding to the TRAP•RNA complex (fractions 14-19) and the second corresponding to the uncomplexed TRAP (fraction 20-25). Within the fractions containing the complex (Fig. 2, dashed line), the molar ratio of TRAP to RNA was 2.1 ± 0.2, n = 19. Similar results were obtained using 2.5-10 pmol of TRAP, as well as using an RNA containing the motif GAGUU repeated 11 times (data not shown). Control experiments showed that the free RNA and TRAP ran as single peaks within fractions 21-25 and 25-30, respectively, and were well separated from the TRAP•RNA complex (data not shown). We also used mobility shift gels to separate the TRAP•RNA complex from the free species of each (Fig. 3). Bands containing the complex were excised from the gel and the molar ratio of TRAP:RNA determined as above. In this case, RNA 36-92 was used and 18 bands were analyzed. The average ratio of TRAP to RNA in the complex was 2.8 ± 1.8. Although the variability seen in this case was higher than seen with the velocity gradients, the results are consistent with a dimer of 11-mers interacting with a single RNA. Taken together, these results indicate that under the conditions tested, two TRAP 11-mers form a complex with one molecule of trp leader RNA. Therefore, all binding data in this paper were analyzed using this stoichiometry. As a tool to study the TRAP-RNA interaction, a filter binding assay was used with unlabeled TRAP and 32P-labeled RNA 36-92, which contains all 11 G/UAG repeats shown previously to be involved in TRAP binding (5.Babitzke P. Stults P. Shire S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Antson A. Otridge J. Brzozwski A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Wilson F.K. Smith T. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and is not predicted to form any stable secondary structure (Fig. 1). To determine the incubation time needed to ensure that our binding assays were performed under equilibrium conditions, two control experiments were done. First, reaction mixtures containing RNA 36-92 and TRAP were incubated for either 15 min or 1 h and then filtered (Fig. 4, open circles, closed triangles, respectively). For either incubation time, a least-squares fit of the binding data to the equilibrium binding equation (20.Riggs A. Suzuki H. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) displayed no significant differences. Second, equilibrium was established by dissociation. The RNA•TRAP complex was allowed to form at high concentrations of TRAP (0.44-200 nM) and RNA 36-92 (0.4 nM) such that nearly all of the RNA should be complexed with TRAP. After an initial 15-min incubation at 37°C, the samples were diluted to the concentrations shown in Fig. 4, incubated for up to 6 h to re-establish equilibrium and then filtered (Fig. 4, closed stars). Again, the binding curve obtained was nearly identical to that observed when the mixture was allowed to incubate for 15 min (Fig. 4, compare closed triangles and open circles). Therefore, a 15-min incubation period is sufficient to allow our binding assay to achieve equilibration and this time was used for all subsequent experiments. Based on the best fit of the binding data, the apparent binding constant (Kapp) for the TRAP-RNA interaction was determined to be 8.0 ± 1.3 × 109M-1 (Kd = 0.12 ± 0.02 nM). Based on the procedure of Witherell and Uhlenbeck (21.Witherell G. Uhlenbeck O. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we found that at least 65% of our TRAP preparation was active to bind RNA (data not shown). Therefore, the Kapp reported above must be considered as a lower limit since less than 100% of the protein may be active. As shown previously(4.Otridge P. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5.Babitzke P. Stults P. Shire S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the interaction between TRAP and trp leader RNA is completely dependent on the presence of L-tryptophan since apo-TRAP, in the absence of tryptophan, showed no significant binding to trp leader RNA at any protein concentrations tested (Fig. 4, closed squares). Furthermore, a nonspecific RNA showed no binding to TRAP above background levels within the protein concentrations tested (data not shown). To investigate the thermodynamic parameters that drive the interaction between TRAP and trp leader RNA, Kapp values were determined for TRAP binding to trp leader RNA 36-92 at various temperatures. Surprisingly, Kapp was found to increase with increasing temperature between 5 and 47°C (Fig. 5). The van't Hoff plot of these data (Fig. 5) yields ΔH = +15.9 kcal mol-1. This enthalpic contribution to the binding free energy is extremely unfavorable and is compensated by a large favorable entropic contribution, ΔS = +97 cal mol-1 K-1. Together, these values yield a ΔG37°C of −14.2 kcal mol-1 and demonstrate that the binding of TRAP to trp leader RNA is entirely driven by changes in entropy. To examine the role of electrostatic interactions in the TRAP•trp leader RNA complex, we determined Kapp as a function of ionic strength using different concentrations of potassium glutamate with or without MgCl2. In the presence of 4 mM MgCl2 (Fig. 6, closed circles), binding was found to be insensitive to potassium glutamate concentrations between 100 and 700 mM (-δlog Kapp/δlog [potassium glutamate] ≈ 0). In the absence of MgCl2 (Fig. 6, open circles), Kapp showed only a slight dependence on the concentration of potassium glutamate (-δlog Kapp/δlog [potassium glutamate] ≈ 1). Similar results were obtained with NaCl or KCl (data not shown), indicating that the identity of the monovalent cation is not critical for stability of the complex. Furthermore, since neither KCl nor potassium glutamate had a significant effect on Kapp, it appears that anion release is not a significant factor in complex formation. Therefore, it appears that few, if any electrostatic interactions play a major role in stabilizing the TRAP•trp leader RNA complex. The role that titratable groups have on the interaction between TRAP and trp leader RNA was examined by determining the Kapp for this interaction at pH values from 5 to 10. The Kapp for TRAP binding to RNA 36-92 was found to be independent of pH within a range of pH 6 to 10 (Fig. 7). At pH 5, the Kapp decreased 200-fold to 1 × 107M-1. The effects of pH on binding above pH 10 were not studied due to chemical degradation of the cellulose nitrate filters. This broad pH optimum suggests that groups titratable within this pH range are not significant in stabilizing the interaction. Previous work (5.Babitzke P. Stults P. Shire S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) along with our own (data not shown) demonstrated that the TRAP•trp leader RNA complex is very stable in the presence of excess L-tryptophan showing no significant dissociation after 30 min. However, it seems unlikely that an RNA-binding regulatory protein such as TRAP would have such a slow off-rate in vivo since this would lead to the titration of TRAP, thereby leaving none available to bind new trp leader transcripts, resulting in the constitutive expression of the trp operon. To study this question, we examined dissociation of RNA from the tryptophan•TRAP•trp leader RNA ternary complex in the presence of various concentrations of L-tryptophan. We first allowed TRAP and trp leader RNA to form a complex in 25 μl of FBB with 40 μML-tryptophan, which was found to fully activate TRAP to bind trp leader RNA (data not shown; (22.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12452-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). The complex was then diluted 40-fold with 975 μl of FBB containing the appropriate concentration of tryptophan to yield the final tryptophan concentrations indicated in Fig. 8. To determine koff, the binding data at each concentration of tryptophan were analyzed assuming a single exponential decay. We found that the dissociation rate for RNA was strongly dependent on the concentration of tryptophan. As the final concentration of tryptophan was lowered, koff for the TRAP•RNA complex increased rapidly (Fig. 8). When the final concentration of tryptophan was 10.75 μM, koff was 0.15 ± 0.07 min-1. As the final concentration of tryptophan was lowered to 5.9, 3.4, and 1 μM, koff increased to 0.31 ± 0.06 min-1, 0.52 ± 0.07 min-1, and 1.8 ± 0.3 min-1, respectively. These results demonstrate that tryptophan can dissociate from the TRAP•RNA•L-tryptophan ternary complex and that this dissociation destabilizes the TRAP-RNA interaction. Therefore, dissociation of L-tryptophan from the ternary complex is the rate-limiting step for RNA dissociation. The x-ray crystal struc"

Previous studies have shown that these activated STATs dimerize to form four distinct STAT complexes which translocate to the nucleus and activates transcription by binding to specific promoter elements. The interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) consists of Stat2 and Stat1 heterodimers in association with a DNA-binding protein, p48, that binds to the interferon stimulated response element. Homo- and heterodimers of Stat1 and Stat3 bind to the palindromic interferon response element (pIRE). In this report we demonstrate the utility of a biochemical procedure that we have developed, based on genomic DNA affinity chromatography, for the identification of IFN-α-induced STAT complexes. Using this approach, we identified ISGF3-independent Stat2-containing STAT complexes. Results from the analysis of Stat2 complexes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were consistent with genomic DNA affinity chromatography results and identified a Stat2:1 complex that binds with low affinity to the pIRE of the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene. Immunoprecipitation studies of Stat2 revealed an IFN-α dependent co-precipitation of both Stat1 and Stat3. Taken together, our results suggest that IFN-α activates, in addition to ISGF3, other Stat2-containing STAT complexes, one of which binds to an element related to the interferon regulatory factor-1 pIRE.

STATs associate via their SH2 domains with specific phosphotyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of the activated receptor components, leading to a Jak-dependent phosphorylation/activation of receptor associated STATs(8.Greenlund A.C.

Additionally, homo- and heterodimers of Stat1 and Stat3 (Stat1:1, Stat1:3, and Stat3:3) recognize an element designated the palindromic interferon response element (pIRE), with a consensus sequence TTC/ANNNG/TAA, regulating expression of a distinct subset of ISGs(20.Kanno Y.

Studies with mutant cell lines that are deficient in response to IFN-α indicate that alternative pathways to regulate gene expression, via elements distinct from the previously described ISRE or pIRE, may exist(22.Guille M.J. Laxton C.D. Rutherford M.N. Williams B.R.G. Kerr I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To date, the procedure to identify STAT complexes induced by IFN-α was dependent on the prior identification of the target DNA elements involved(23.Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, other IFN-α-induced STAT complexes may form that target yet unidentified DNA elements. In this report we describe a novel biochemical approach utilizing genomic DNA affinity chromatography (GDAC) for the identification of IFN-α-inducible STAT complexes. This technique permits the identification of STAT complexes irrespective of the DNA recognition elements involved. We show that this technique can be used to identify the previously characterized IFN-α-inducible STAT complexes that recognize both the ISRE of the 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene and the pIRE of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene. Our studies also identified ISGF3-independent Stat2-containing STAT complexes. Since we are able to demonstrate that an IFN-α-inducible Stat2:1 complex binds with low affinity to the IRF-1 pIRE, in the absence of p48, and Stat3 will co-precipitate with Stat2 following IFN-α treatment of cells, we infer that multiple Stat2-containing complexes are induced upon IFN-α treatment of responsive cells. U266 cells (ATCC TIB196) are routinely subcultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. For the preparation of cytoplasmic extracts, actively growing cells were suspended for 1 h at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in complete medium containing 10 mM NaF. Cells were concentrated to 2 × 107 and treated with an IFN-α, IFN-Con1 at 5 ng/ml for 15 min. Recombinant human IFN-Con1 (specific activity, 3 × 109 units/mg of protein) was kindly provided by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the procedure described previously(25.Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM Na3VO4 and 5 mM NaF and once with hypotonic buffer. Following incubation for 10 min in hypotonic buffer at 108 cells/ml, cells were disrupted by repeated passage through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 s. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was supplemented to 60 mM with KCl, clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, then made to 12% glycerol and 0.05% Triton X-100. The pellet (crude nuclei) was suspended in hypotonic buffer, layered over a 30% sucrose solution in hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet (nuclear fraction) was incubated in high salt buffer at 2.5 × 108 cells/ml for 30 min, clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100. Cytoplasmic fractions yielded ∼37 μg of protein/106 cells and nuclear fractions yielded ∼15 μg of protein/106 cells, based on the Bradford method for protein determination (Bio-Rad). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were aliquoted and stored at −70°C.

Where indicated, 600 ng of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were added. This mixture (200 μl) was incubated for 2 h with 100 μl of bovine genomic DNA-cellulose (Sigma) that was equilibrated in binding buffer. The DNA-cellulose was then washed three times with 3 ml of wash buffer, and DNA-binding proteins were eluted by incubation for 30 min in 200 μl of elution buffer. Following centrifugation, the supernatant (high salt eluate) was concentrated using Microcon-30 microconcentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), boiled with reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed in Western blotting experiments.

This buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A constitutes binding buffer. This buffer containing 360 mM KCl without BSA constitutes elution buffer. Monoclonal antibodies against Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. Anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) monoclonal antibody, clone 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Polyclonal antisera against Stat2 and p48 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. For supershift studies polyclonal antisera against Stat1 and Stat2 were a gift from C.

Preimmune rabbit IgG (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA) was used as a control for immunoprecipitation. Following treatment with IFN-α, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was adjusted to 150 mM NaCl. Lysate from the equivalent of 107 cells was incubated with 1 μg of preimmune rabbit IgG, and 50 μl of a 10% suspension of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Sigma), for 1 h. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of anti-Stat2 polyclonal antiserum or preimmune rabbit IgG for 1 h and then 50 μl of a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added for an additional 1 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling with reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer.

Briefly, extracts were incubated with or without double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the IRF-1 pIRE, the 2′-5′ OAS ISRE, or a mutant ISRE, in the presence of 1 μg poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC), in EMSA buffer for 30 min at room temperature (final volume: 21 μl). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel using 0.2 × TBE (final concentration 18 mM Tris borate, 0.4 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) as running buffer. For supershift experiments, 0.5 μl of polyclonal antisera to Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, or preimmune sera were incubated with protein extracts for 30 min at 4°C prior to the addition of DNA. EMSA buffer contains: 12 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 40 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.12 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.06 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Western blotting was performed by a modification of the procedure described(29.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins from the equivalent of 5 × 106 cells and GDAC-eluted fractions from the equivalent of 106 cells (cytoplasmic) or 3 × 106 cells (nuclear) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Both continuous (7%) and gradient (4%-12%) SDS-PAGE gels were used as indicated in the figure legends. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) for 1 h at 100 V. For protein-DNA complexes resolved in EMSA, the gel was first equilibrated in transfer buffer for 30 min prior to electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. The conditions for Western blotting with specific antibodies were performed as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the nitrocellulose was first incubated in blocking buffer, followed by incubation with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Monoclonal antibodies to Stat1, Stat3, and Tyr(P) were used at a dilution of 1:2,000, antibody to Stat2 was used at 1:1,000, and polyclonal antiserum to p48 was used at 1:100. The nitrocellulose was then washed six times for 5 min each in wash buffer, followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (Amersham, Bucks, United Kingdom) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Sigma) were used at a dilution of 1:2,000. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an epichemiluminescence system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer buffer contains: 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol. Wash buffer contains: 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Wash buffer containing 1% BSA constitutes blocking buffer. Human myeloma U266 cells were either left untreated, or treated with IFN-α at 5 ng/ml for 15 min in the presence of NaF, which inhibits nuclear translocation of IFN-α activated STAT complexes(30.Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We found that the cytoplasmic accumulation of ISGF3 was maximal following a 15-min treatment with IFN-α (data not shown). The preparation of cytoplasmic extracts from IFN-α-treated cells in the presence of NaF yields a fraction containing DNA-binding STAT complexes with relatively few other DNA-binding proteins. These cytoplasmic extracts were then analyzed using GDAC and the high salt eluates resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. We found that STAT complexes can be eluted from genomic DNA at KCl concentrations as low as 300 mM. At this concentration many DNA-binding proteins present in the cytoplasm remain associated with the DNA, further enhancing the identification of STATs (data not shown). Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting revealed at least six IFN-α-induced proteins (Fig. 1). Reprobing this blot with antibodies to specific STAT proteins, showed that the tyrosine phosphorylated bands detected with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody correspond to the STAT proteins Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3. Anti-Stat1 antibody detected two proteins with relative molecular weights of 97 and 90 kDa, anti-Stat2 antibody detected a single protein of 113 kDa, and three proteins of 95, 94, and 85 kDa were detected using anti-Stat3 antibody. Cytoplasmic extracts from untreated cells lacked DNA binding factors when immunoblotted with either anti-Tyr(P) or anti-STAT antibodies. Additionally, no factors were detected in either anti-Tyr(P) or anti-STAT immunoblots when cytoplasmic extracts from IFN-α-treated cells were incubated with a cellulose matrix devoid of DNA (data not shown). Our initial results suggested that GDAC can be used to identify IFN-α-induced STATs, irrespective of the DNA recognition elements involved. To date, IFN-α-induced STAT complexes have been shown to recognize either the ISRE or the pIRE. Hence, addition of excess DNA recognition element to the cytoplasmic extracts prior to GDAC can be used to identify specific IFN-α-induced STAT complexes. The addition of competing IRF-1 pIRE oligodeoxynucleotides prevented Stat1, Stat3, and, to a lesser extent, Stat2 (see below) binding to genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Stat1 and Stat3 have been shown to form homo- and heterodimers that specifically recognize the pIRE(12.Raz R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24391-24395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Competition with 2′-5′ OAS ISRE oligodeoxynucleotides reduced Stat2 and Stat1, but not Stat3 binding to genomic DNA. This is consistent, in part, with published results indicating that the ISRE binding STAT complex, ISGF3, contains Stat1 and Stat2 but not Stat3(6.Fu X.-Y. Schindler C. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7840-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The absence of complete competition of Stat2 by the ISRE, however, suggests that Stat2 may form a STAT complex(es) that binds DNA at a site(s) distinct from the ISRE. As a control, we included mutant ISRE oligodeoxynucleotides as competitor. This element did not compete for any of the STATs. The data in Fig. 1 suggest that IFN-α induces a novel Stat2 DNA-binding complex(es) with a recognition element(s) distinct from the ISRE. To confirm that an IFN-α-induced Stat2 containing complex other than ISGF3 is induced in U266 cells, the following experiments were conducted. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of IFN-α-treated U266 cells were analyzed by GDAC in the presence of ISRE oligodeoxynucleotides. The high salt eluates were examined for the presence of an ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex in immunoblotting experiments with antibodies to both Stat2 and p48. The addition of ISRE oligodeoxynucleotides to both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of IFN-α treated cells had the effect of completely competing ISGF3, as evidenced by the total depletion of p48, yet residual Stat2 DNA binding activity was detected (Fig. 2A). The addition of mutant ISRE oligodeoxynucleotides had no effect on either Stat2 or p48 binding to genomic DNA. Earlier studies suggested that Stat2 does not bind the pIRE(32.Seegert D. Strehlow I. Klose B. Levy D.E. Schindler C. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 8590-8595Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, we found that the presence of excess IRF-1 pIRE oligodeoxynucleotides affected the genomic DNA binding activity of Stat2 (Fig. 1). Therefore, we performed a titration with the pIRE to determine the DNA binding characteristics of the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es). Cytoplasmic extracts of IFN-α-treated U266 cells were analyzed using GDAC in the presence of excess 2′-5′ OAS ISRE and increasing amounts of IRF-1 pIRE oligodeoxynucleotides. The high salt eluates were examined for the presence of the IFN-α-induced STAT proteins Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3. Whereas genomic DNA binding of both Stat1 and Stat3 was largely eliminated, Stat2 was only mildly affected by the addition of 150 ng of pIRE and, indeed, remained bound to genomic DNA in the presence of 600 ng of pIRE oligodeoxynucleotides (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es), unlike homo- and heterodimers of Stat1 and Stat3, exhibits only a low affinity for the pIRE. DNA-binding STAT complexes contain dimers of STAT proteins formed through SH2-phosphotyrosyl peptide interactions(11.Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 17.Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 33.Improta T. Schindler C. Horvath C.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These complexes are sensitive to competition by soluble phosphotyrosine(31.Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). To confirm that STAT dimers are required for ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex formation, we analyzed extracts of IFN-α-treated U266 cells, using GDAC in the presence of ISRE oligodeoxynucleotides, for sensitivity to phosphotyrosine. The results shown in Fig. 2C demonstrate that the presence of phosphotyrosine abrogates the DNA binding activity of the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es), whereas phosphothreonine or phosphoserine had no effect. ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es), as assayed in GDAC, exhibit a relatively low affinity for the IRF-1 pIRE (see Fig. 2B). These results suggest that IFN-α-induced Stat2 complexes may bind to the pIRE under specific conditions that would allow detection in the EMSA. In order to optimize detection of Stat2 in complex with the pIRE, we incubated IFN-α-treated cytoplasmic extracts with a large amount (up to 50 ng) of IRF-1 pIRE. Following EMSA, complexes were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies to Stat2. A pIRE-dependent mobility shift complex, that migrated with a higher mobility than the ISGF3-ISRE complex, was detected in extracts of IFN-α-treated cells only when >5 ng of pIRE probe was used (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Apparently, the Stat2-pIRE complex forms with relatively low affinity, since we were able to detect the ISGF3-ISRE complex using as little as 0.5 ng of ISRE probe. Immunoblotting with antibodies to p48 revealed the association of p48 with the ISRE-Stat2 complex and not the pIRE-Stat2 complex (Fig. 3B, lower panel). This ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex was not found in extracts of untreated cells, nor did it form when IFN-α-treated cell extracts were incubated with a mutant 2′-5′ OAS ISRE as probe (Fig. 3B). Addition of antibodies against Stat1 and Stat2 to the protein-DNA reaction mixture affected the mobility of the pIRE-Stat2 complex in the native gel. Antibodies to Stat3, however, had no effect (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that a Stat2:1 complex can bind, albeit with low affinity, to the IRF-1 pIRE and confirm our results with GDAC. The data in Fig. 2C suggest that the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es) contains a dimer(s) of STAT proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to identify STAT proteins that dimerize with Stat2 in an IFN-α-dependent manner. Using antisera to Stat2, we observed a co-immunoprecipitation of both Stat1 and Stat3 in IFN-α treated cells (Fig. 4A). As the formation of these complexes is dependent on IFN-α, this eliminates the possibility that immunoprecipitation of Stat3 is a result of the anti-Stat2 antisera cross-reacting with Stat3. In control experiments using preimmune antisera for immunoprecipitation, no STAT proteins were detected. The results shown in Fig. 4B demonstrate that the IFN-α-induced Stat2:3 complex is sensitive to competition by soluble phosphotyrosine and not phosphothreonine or phosphoserine. Taken together, our data suggest that heterodimers of Stat2:1 and Stat2:3 are formed following treatment of cells with IFN-α. To date, the procedure to identify STAT complexes was dependent on the prior identification of the target DNA elements involved(23.Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Our approach employing GDAC permits the identification of STAT complexes irrespective of the DNA recognition elements and, hence, has general application in studies of cytokine-induced STATs. Using this approach we were able to identify the individual IFN-α-induced STATs, as well as the complexes they form. Having analyzed a number of IFN-α-sensitive cell lines, we conclude that within the first 15 min of IFN-α treatment only activation of STATs that are recognized by antibodies to Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3 occurs (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The different functional isoforms of IFN-α-induced STATs were revealed (Fig. 1). Our results are in agreement with earlier studies suggesting that both forms of Stat1, Stat1α and Stat1β, are involved in STAT complex formation(13.Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Based on their electrophoretic mobility, we demonstrate that antibodies to Stat3 recognizes three different proteins. The two slower migrating factors likely represent Stat3 isoforms that differ at the level of serine phosphorylation(37.Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Cheng-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The third, faster migrating factor may be analogous to the Stat1 isoform, Stat1β, i.e. a differentially spliced product of the same gene. Such a factor has been described recently (38.Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and designated Stat3β. Only a single isoform of Stat2 was identified. Functionally diverse cytokines and growth factors have been shown to activate both Stat1 and Stat3. These include, in addition to IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and other gp130-mediated signaling proteins, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor(7.Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 12.Raz R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24391-24395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, IFN-α is the only cytokine known to activate Stat2. Moreover, Stat2 is a critical regulator of IFN-α signal transduction, since the activation of Stat1 by IFN-α is dependent on the prior activation of Stat2(15.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Once activated, STAT proteins apparently exhibit overlapping functions. Studies of gene activation by IFN-α and IFN-γ have revealed functional similarities between the Stat2:1 dimer of the IFN-α-induced ISGF3 and the Stat1:1 dimer induced by IFN-γ(40.Bluyssen H.A.R. Muzaffar R. Vlieststra R.J. Van der Made A.C.J. Leung S. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Trapman J. Levy D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5645-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Analysis of the DNA binding specificity of chimeric STAT proteins has localized the DNA binding domain between amino acid residues 300-500 (41.Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 42.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Stat2 exhibits a high degree of amino acid identity to the other STATs in this region(43.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Moreover, point mutational analysis of the DNA binding domain of Stat3 has identified specific residues important for DNA binding activity(41.Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These residues are also highly conserved in Stat2. To date, four distinct IFN-α-inducible STAT complexes have been described in the literature: homo- and heterodimers of Stat1 and Stat3 and a Stat2:1 heterodimer, which binds DNA via an adapter protein p48. However, in the light of recent data suggesting that Stat2 may possess an intrinsic DNA-binding domain, Stat2 may function in Stat complexes in addition to ISGF3. Using GDAC we performed competition experiments with oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the pIRE of the IRF-1 gene and the ISRE of the 2′-5′ OAS gene to identify IFN-α-induced STAT complexes (Fig. 1). Our studies revealed a Stat2-containing STAT complex(es) distinct from those identified previously. This complex(es) is capable of binding genomic DNA in the presence of excess ISRE (Fig. 2A). Competition experiments with the ISRE indicated that the ratio of ISGF3 to total DNA-binding Stat2 is lower in the nucleus than the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). As p48 is a component of ISGF3 and is required for DNA binding activity, this result likely reflects a lower ratio of p48 to total DNA-binding Stat2 in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm. An excess of IRF-1 pIRE (600 ng) partially competed the DNA binding activity of the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that this complex(es) can bind to this element. However, as the DNA binding activity of both Stat1 and Stat3 was largely eliminated by excess pIRE, these Stat2- containing complex(es) likely bind with relatively low affinity. Nevertheless, following prolonged autoradiographic exposure, residual low levels of DNA binding Stat1 and Stat3 were apparent in the IFN-α-inducible cell extracts from which ISRE- and pIRE-binding complexes had been depleted (data not shown). The implications are that the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es) may require Stat1 and/or Stat3 for DNA binding. The results in Fig. 2C reveal that these complex(es) bind DNA as a dimer. Consistent with the observed low affinity binding of Stat2 complex(es) to the pIRE in GDAC (Fig. 2B), low affinity, pIRE-binding Stat2:1 heterodimers were detected in EMSA (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunoprecipitation experiments identified an IFN-α-inducible Stat2:1 dimer and a novel Stat2:3 dimer (Fig. 4). Moreover, in vitro studies involving tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat2 purified from baculovirus infected insect cells, identified Stat2 homodimerization. ( (2)C. Schindler, personal communication.) Taken together, these data suggest that the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complexes identified using GDAC likely contain the STAT dimers Stat2:1, Stat2:2, and Stat2:3. However, in the mobility shift assay we detected only a Stat2:1 heterodimer in complex with the pIRE. The absence of both Stat2:2 and Stat2:3 complexes may be a consequence of a lower affinity and/or abundance of these complexes compared with the Stat2:1 complex. Alternatively, Stat2:2 and Stat2:3 complexes may bind to DNA elements distinct from the consensus ISRE and pIREs. We propose that one or more high affinity DNA recognition elements for the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complexes exist that are related to the IRF-1 pIRE. Recent evidence suggests that Stat2, within the complex of ISGF3, does not contact DNA directly. Instead it participates in the DNA binding activity of ISGF3 by interacting with the DNA-binding protein p48(17.Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Originally we hypothesized that the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es) may also require a p48-like adapter protein for DNA binding. The DNA binding activity of ISGF3 is sensitive to alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)(30.Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The addition of extracts from untreated cells to NEM treated extracts of IFN-α-induced cells, restores ISGF3, suggesting that only p48 is sensitive to NEM. We found that, although the ISGF3-independent Stat2 complex(es) was sensitive to NEM treatment, the DNA binding activity could not be restored by the addition of extracts from untreated cells (data not shown). Given the relatively high frequency of cysteine residues within STAT proteins, these results are not surprising; the conditions we employed for NEM treatment promote alkylation of cysteine residues, thus inactivation of STAT dimer binding to either an adapter protein, or directly to DNA, could be expected. This NEM sensitivity of STAT dimer(s) precludes the use of this assay to predict the presence of a p48-like protein(s) within STAT complex(es). In this report, we demonstrate for the first time Stat2 DNA binding activity independent of ISGF3. We propose that these Stat2-containing STAT dimers regulate transcription by interacting with an element(s) related to the IRF-1 pIRE that is present in the promoter region of specific ISGs. Identification of this promoter element(s) will shed light on the role of these complexes in IFN-α signal transduction. We gratefully acknowledge the generosity of L. Blatt (Amgen, Inc.) for IFN-Con1."
https://openalex.org/W2121743106,"We have examined the post-translational modification of high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and have shown that MAP1, MAP2, and MAP4 are glycosylated. The presence of carbohydrate residues on these proteins was indicated by labeling with biotin hydrazide following periodate oxidation, a specific and well established method for detecting saccharide moieties on proteins. Both MAP2 and MAP4 were also labeled in vitro by UDP-[3H]galactose in the presence of galactosyltransferase. Labeling by galactosyltransferase indicated that MAP2 and MAP4 contained terminal nonreducing GlcNAc residues, and they appeared to be O-linked to the proteins as shown by their sensitivity to β-elimination. Chromatographic analysis showed that the GlcNAc residues were directly linked to the proteins as monosaccharides. Thus, we have added MAP2 and MAP4 to the list of intracellular O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, which includes other cytoskeletal proteins such as cytokeratins 8, 13, and 18 and neurofilament proteins NF-L and NF-M. We further characterized the O-GlcNAc modification of MAP2, and stoichiometric analysis indicated that nearly 10% of the MAP2 isolated from rat brain is modified by O-GlcNAc. However, this estimate is thought to reflect the minimal level of O-GlcNAc modification present on MAP2. We have also shown that both the O-GlcNAc and biotin hydrazide-reactive carbohydrate moieties are located on the projection domain of MAP2. Three O-GlcNAc-containing peaks were observed following fast protein liquid chromatography of a tryptic digest of MAP2, suggesting that multiple modification sites exist. The specific modification sites and functional significance of the O-GlcNAc glycosylation on the high Mr MAPs remain to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W2094174069,"To clarify the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) containing Src homology 2 regions (SHPTP2) in insulin signaling, either wild-type or mutant SHPTP2 (delta PTP; lacking full PTPase domain) was expressed in Rat 1 fibroblasts overexpressing human insulin receptors. In response to insulin, phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), IRS-1-associated PTPase activities and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase activities were slightly enhanced in wild-type cells when compared with those in the parent cells transfected with hygromycin-resistant gene alone. In contrast, introduction of delta PTP inhibited insulin-induced association of IRS-1 with endogenous SHPTP2 and impaired both insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and activation of PI 3'-kinase. Furthermore, decreased content of p85 subunit of PI 3'-kinase was also found in mutant cells. Consistently, the insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activities and DNA synthesis were also enhanced in wild-type cells, but impaired in mutant cells. Thus, the interaction of SHPTP2 with IRS-1 may be associated with modulation of phosphorylation levels of IRS-1, resulting in the changes of PI 3'-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Furthermore, an impaired insulin signaling in mutant cells may be partly reflected in a decreased content of p85 protein of PI 3'-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2125991374,"We developed a unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux technique in which 60 cumulative doses of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), each lasting 6 s, were subsequently added to permeabilized A7r5 cells. This technique allowed an accurate determination of the threshold for InsP3 action, which was around 32 nM InsP3 under control conditions. The InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was characterized by an initial rapid phase, after which the normalized rate progressively decreased. The slowing of the release was associated with a shift of the threshold to higher InsP3 concentrations. Stimulatory concentrations of thimerosal (10 μM) shifted the threshold to 4.5 nM InsP3 and increased both the cooperativity and the maximal normalized rate of Ca2+ release. This low threshold was maintained when the thimerosal concentration was increased to inhibitory levels (100 μM) but then the effects on the cooperativity and on the normalized rate of Ca2+ release disappeared. Oxidized glutathione (5 mM) was much less effective in stimulating the release and did not have an effect on the threshold or on the cooperativity. ATP (5 mM) stimulated the release despite a shift in threshold toward higher InsP3 concentrations. Luminal Ca2+ did not affect the threshold for InsP3 action but stimulated the normalized release at each InsP3 concentration. The inhibitory effect of 10 μM free cytosolic Ca2+ was associated with a shift in threshold to higher InsP3 concentrations and a decreased cooperativity of the release process. We conclude that this novel technique of accurately measuring the threshold for InsP3 action under various experimental conditions has allowed us to refine the analysis of the kinetic parameters involved in the regulation of the InsP3 receptor.

Bone resorption was reversibly inhibited by tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and trifluoperazine with IC50 values of ∼1 μM. Diethylstilbestrol and 17-β-estradiol had no effects on bone resorption at receptor-saturating concentrations, while ICI 182780 inhibited bone resorption at concentrations greater than 1 μM. At these concentrations ICI 182780, like tamoxifen, inhibits calmodulin-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity. Membrane HCl transport, assessed by ATP-dependent acridine orange uptake, was unaffected by 17-β-estradiol and diethylstilbestrol at concentrations up to 10 μM, while ICI 182780 inhibited HCl transport at concentrations greater than 1 μM. In contrast HCl transport was inhibited by tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and the calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine and calmidazolium, with IC50 values of 0.25-1.5 μM.

https://openalex.org/W2035011037,"The members of the syndecan family are temporally and spatially expressed heparan sulfate proteoglycans of various tissues, where they mediate extracellular influences on cell morphology and behavior. Functional characterization of the mouse syndecan-1 promoter was carried out in order to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the high transcription levels of syndecan-1 gene in various epithelia. For that 9.5 kilobase pairs of the upstream region of mouse syndecan-1 gene were cloned, sequenced, and used to prepare chimaeric constructs with a reporter gene followed by transient or stable transfections into NMuMG epithelial and 3T3 fibroblastic cells. In NMuMG cells, cultured either in the presence or absence of serum, the 2.5-kilobase pair promoter region resulted in the constitutive transcription activity, whereas in 3T3 cells the serum depletion decreased the promoter activity significantly. Deletion of the upstream sequences to −437 base pairs relative to the translation initiation site had little effect on this promoter activity. Further deletion to −365 base pairs removed three GT boxes and slightly increased the promoter activity, whereas the deletion of the next two GC boxes (to −326 base pair) reduced the promoter activity dramatically. All of the GC or GT box sequences bound the same set of Sp1-like nuclear proteins in gel shift assays. Nuclear protein binding was also demonstrated around both of the most intense transcription initiation sites. Mutation of these regions separately resulted in total loss of transcription initiation from the deleted site and decreased the promoter activity in relation to the intensity of the abolished start site. This indicates that the transcription initiation of the syndecan-1 gene is directed through initiator-like elements directly overlapping the start sites, as shown for several TATA-less housekeeping and growth regulated genes. We assume that the constitutive high level gene expression in epithelial cells is achieved by the proximal promoter, which is controlled by members of Sp1 transcription factor family."

These results implicate a novel role for integrins and Rho in the regulation of tumor growth in response to matrix. INTRODUCTIONThe integrins are a family of adhesion receptors that play a role in the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix(1.Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 2.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix play a role in diverse processes such as differentiation(3.Jones P.L. Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 137-154PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Adams J. Watts F. Development. 1993; 117: 1183-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lymphocyte activation (5.Matsuyama T. Yamada A. Kay J. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and tumor cell dissemination and metastasis(6.Ruoslahti E. Giancotti F.G. Cancer Cells. 1989; 1: 119-125PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen is a major component of the extracellular matrix that serves as a scaffold for cell binding but also plays a role in cell differentiation and growth(7.Kleinman H.K. Klebe R.J. Martin G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar).In vitro, interaction of cells with a collagen matrix can induce arachidonic acid production in HeLa cells (8.Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and glandular differentiation in a human colon carcinoma line(9.Pignatelli M. Bodmer W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5561-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Clustering of the α2β1 integrin, a receptor for collagen, induces stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and accumulation of GTP bound Ras in a human lymphoblastic cell line(10.Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 20701-20704Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix can also regulate growth by creating a permissive effect for the action of mitogens(11.Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 12.Otsuka H. Moscovitz M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 87: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, specific interaction between integrins and matrix components provide another level of growth regulation. A potential mediator of integrin signaling is the small GTP binding protein Rho. It is a member of the Ras family of GTPases that regulates the formation of actin stress fibers in response to growth factors(13.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Integrins can also regulate the formation of actin stress fibers(14.Bauer J.S. Varner J. Schreiner C. Kornberg L. Nicholas R. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which suggests a convergence of integrin and Rho signaling pathways.A role in mitogen signaling has been demonstrated for Rho using Val-14 mutations, analogous to Val-12 oncogenic mutations in Ras, which induced transformation of fibroblasts(15.Perona R. Esteve P. Jímenez B. Ballestero R.P. Ramòn y Cajal S. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification of Rho by transfection resulted in cells that exhibited increased tumorigenicity, higher saturation density, and reduced serum dependence(16.Avraham H. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2058-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutations in Dbl, a guanine exchange factor for Rho, also induced cellular transformation(17.Ruggiero M. Srivastava S.K. Fleming T.P. Ron D. Eva A. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 767-771PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated the induction of phospholipid levels in untransformed fibroblasts upon adhesion to fibronectin by a mechanism involving Rho. This pathway may provide a mechanism for integrating adhesion with soluble growth factors that generate phospholipid derived second messenger signals(19.Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 20.McNamee H. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for Rho in the regulation of both cell growth and cell architecture. A means for elucidating the function of Rho has employed the use of the ADP-ribosylation exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum. C3 could efficiently modify Rho A, B, and C by ribosylation to alter their function, presumably by inhibiting interaction with downstream effectors(21.Mohr C. Koch G. Just I. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22.Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other Rho family proteins such as Rac-1 and CDC42 are poor substrates in vitro(23.Ménard L. Tomhave E. Casey P.J. Uhing R.J. Snyderman R. Didsbury J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24.Just I. Mohr C. Schallehn G. Menard L. Didsbury J.R. Vandekerchkove J. van Damme J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10274-10280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore C3 provides a sensitive means for elucidating Rho function.In these studies, we investigated a role for integrins and Rho in growth regulation of a tumor line. Cyclin A and cyclin D are regulators of S phase progression(25.Wang J. Chenivesse X. Henglein B. Bréchot C. Nature. 1990; 343: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 26.Xiong Y. Connolly T. Futcher B. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 65: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). They have been implicated in tumorigenesis(25.Wang J. Chenivesse X. Henglein B. Bréchot C. Nature. 1990; 343: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 27.Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and cyclin A and has also been shown to serve as a link between adhesion and cell cycle progression(28.Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Using a gastric tumor line ST2 whose proliferation was previously shown to be regulated by adhesion(29.Udagawa T. Hopwood V.L. Pathak S. McIntyre B.W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated specific β1 integrin-dependent regulation of cyclin A expression, cell cycle progression, and phospholipid synthesis on collagen matrix using monoclonal antibodies that block these events. We also demonstrated the involvement of Rho in this integrin-mediated process by inactivating Rho in tumor cells using C3 exoenzyme. These studies address novel mechanisms relating an integrin and Rho in mediating tumor growth in response to matrix.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and ReagentsST2 and ST7 are tumor lines established from separate patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma.

Boquet P. Gill D.M. Eklund M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) cloned into the pGEX expression vector system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate a glutathione S-transferase fusion (pGEX2T-C3) was a gift of Dr. Larry Feig (Tufts University, Boston, MA). Purification of recombinant C3 was performed as described. 2Dillon, S. T., and Feig, L. A.(1995) Methods Enzymol.256, 174-184. Essentially, a single colony of Escherichia coli (strain JM109) transformed with pGEX2T-C3 DNA was inoculated into 100 ml of LB culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37°C on a shaker table. This culture was then added to 900 ml of LB containing ampicillin and shaken at 37°C for 1 h. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the culture was grown at 37°C with shaking for an additional 7 h. The bacteria was centrifuged at 5,000 × g, and the pellet lysed in 40 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1% Triton X-100, 25% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice with occasional stirring. The slurry was sonicated for 3 min, and pancreatic DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, stirred for an additional 20 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.The lysate was added to 1 ml of washed glutathione-agarose beads (Pharmacia) and mixed gently at 4°C. The beads were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, washed five times with 14 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and washed three times with 14 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and the beads were resuspended in 0.5 ml of the Tris buffer. 30 NIH units of purified bovine α-thrombin was added and incubated for 16 h at 4°C to cleave the fusion protein. The beads were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min, washed twice with 1 ml of the Tris solution, and concentrated using a Centricon-3 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The purified product ran as a single band at approximately 25 kDa on a 11.25% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).C3 RibosylationIn microcentrifuge tubes, cells were washed five times with PBS, and the pellet was lysed and sonicated in buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM benzamidine hydrochloride, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. About 50 μg of protein were added to a reaction mix containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM thymidine, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mMDL-dithiothreitol, 2 × 106 cpm [32P]NAD (DuPont NEN), and 1.0 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction mix was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. 11 μl of a 70% trichloroacetic acid solution was added to stop the reaction. The precipitated proteins were electrophoresed on an 11.25% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and then fixed in acetic acid/methanol/water (10:50:40) containing 0.2% Coomassie Blue R-250, destained in acetic acid/methanol/water (10:40:50), dried, and autoradiographed. Carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa) and trypsin inhibitor (21 kDa) were used as molecular weight markers (Broad Range molecular weight standards, Bio-Rad).Immobilization of Purified Matrix Proteins and Modification of Tissue Culture SurfacePurified rat collagen type I (Sigma) and laminin from Engelbreth Holm-Swarm sarcoma cells (Sigma) were coated onto tissue culture wells (10 μ/cm2) as recommended by vendor. PolyHEMA (Sigma) was dissolved in 95% ethanol and air dried onto tissue culture plastic at 5 mg/cm2 to inhibit cell attachment and spreading. Human plasma fibronectin (Sigma) was diluted in PBS to 50 μg/ml and adsorbed onto tissue culture surfaces for 4 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. All wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 4 h at room temperature. The wells were rinsed three times with PBS before adding cells.Image CaptureImages were taken on a Nikon DIAPHOT-TMD inverted scope using a VI-470 CCD video camera system (Optronics Engineering, Gogeta, CA) digitized by a QuickCapture frame grabber board (Data Translation Inc., Marlboro, MA) and then stored on a magneto optical disc cartridge utilizing a Third Wave OptiDisk drive (Third Wave Computing, Inc., Austin, TX).Proliferation AssayCell number was determined essentially as described(34.Potten C.S. Booth C. Chadwick C.A. Evans G.S. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured in 96-well plates were fixed with 70% ethanol at −20°C for 5 min and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet dissolved in H2O for 5 min at room temperature. The wells were rinsed with H20 three times and aspirated, and the insoluble crystals were dissolved in 2% SDS/H20. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm.Propidium Iodide StainingTo analyze cellular DNA content, cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min and then resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 25μg/ml RNase. After 30 min at room temperature, the cells were analyzed on an EPICS Profile (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). The Multicycle program (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) was used to analyze the histograms.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted by the method of Huang and High(35.Huang M.N. High K.A. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 711-713PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after transfer of cells to microcentrifuge tubes, 2 × 106 cells were lysed gently in 0.5 ml of solution I containing 2% SDS, 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA at room temperature. 150 μl of ice-cold solution II containing 42.9% (w/v) potassium acetate and 11.2% (v/v) acetic acid was added, mixed, and placed on ice for 3 min to precipitate DNA and proteins. The insoluble material was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1) according to standard procedures (36.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: E.3-E.4Google Scholar) and precipitated with isopropanol. Approximately 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes (DuPont NEN) by vacuum transfer (LKB, Bromma, Sweden), and hybridized according to standard procedures (36.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: E.3-E.4Google Scholar) with 50 ng of cDNA labeled with [α-32P]ATP using a random prime labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim).Phospholipid AnalysisCells (2 × 105) were washed three times in phosphate free RPMI (ICN) containing 5% bovine serum albumin supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and then incubated in the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (DuPont NEN) for 3 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The samples were cooled by placing the tissue culture plates on ice, and adherent cells were treated briefly for 2 min with 0.5% (w/v) trypsin and 0.1% EDTA diluted in PBS. After pelleting in microcentrifuge tubes, the cells were lysed in 180 μl of methanol/1 N HCl (1:1). Chloroform (150 μl) was added and vortexed vigorously for 10 s. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature to separate phases, and the bottom organic layer was removed. 10 μl of this sample was spotted onto a flexible 1B-F silica gel plates (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) pretreated with 1% oxalic acid and developed in buffer composed of chloroform/methanol/29.5% ammonium hydroxide/water (9:7:0.3:1.7). Radioactive spots were visualized by autoradiography, and phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate were identified by comparison with phospholipid standards.RESULTSC3 Exoenzyme Inhibits Cell ProliferationGiven a role for Rho in the regulation of cell morphology and growth, we initially investigated the effect of inhibiting Rho by culturing the cells in the presence of C3 exoenzyme from C. botulinum, which was previously demonstrated to specifically inhibit Rho by ADP-ribosylation (21.Mohr C. Koch G. Just I. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22.Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, increasing amounts of C3 exoenzyme were added to cultures of cells plated on substrate. After 5 days in culture, cell number was determined, and relative cell number was expressed as a ratio of the number of cells cultured with C3 versus the number of cells cultured without C3. Cell proliferation was inhibited dose-dependently, with maximal inhibition at approximately 30-50 μg/ml (Fig. 1A). This demonstrated that C3 was taken up by the cells to ribosylate and inactivate Rho in situ. Using 50 μg/ml, C3 not only inhibited ST2 but also exhibited cytostatic activity for a number of other cell lines as well (Fig. 1B).C3 Catalyzed Ribosylation Induces Alterations in Cell MorphologyCells cultured in the presence of 50 μg/ml of C3 exoenzyme for 24 h exhibited pronounced alteration in morphology, showing slender processes and numerous micro-spikes relative to nontreated cells (Fig. 2). Using the same isolation procedure as for C3, a control preparation from untransformed bacteria had no effect on either morphology or proliferation, demonstrating that the effects were not due to contaminating bacterial components (not shown). These results further suggested that Rho was ribosylated by the C3 taken up by the cells from the culture medium. To demonstrate this, whole cell lysates prepared from cells cultured in the absence or the presence of 50 μg/ml C3 were subjected to in vitro C3 catalyzed ribosylation using [32P]NAD as a ribose donor followed by SDS electrophoresis. In Fig. 3, the resulting autoradiogram revealed that C3 specifically labeled a species that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 25 kDa on a 11.25% polyacrylamide gel; this is consistent with previously published reports of the specificity for C3 catalyzed ribosylation of Rho(23.Ménard L.

Lysates from cells cultured in the presence of C3 (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) showed a greatly reduced level of 32P-labeled Rho indicating prior endogenous ADP-ribosylation.Figure 2:C3 induced morphological changes.

In Fig. 4, propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis revealed accumulation of cells in G0/G1 and a reduction in the number of cells in S phase after C3 treatment. In the absence of C3 treatment, 45.3% of the cells were in S phase, whereas 36.3% were in G0/G1; in the presence of C3 exoenzyme, 33.0% of the cells were in S phase, whereas 51% were in G0/G1. G0/G1 accumulation was also observed for other lines treated with C3 and is summarized in Table 1. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of C3 on proliferation (Fig. 1B) occurs at a specific point in the cell cycle to inhibit G0/G1 to S phase transition.Figure 4:Cell cycle analysis of C3-treated cells. ST2 cells were plated on collagen either in the presence (A) or the absence (B) of C3, incubated for 48 h, and then analyzed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1We next investigated the effect of adhesion and C3 on cell cycle progression at the transcriptional level by analyzing the expression of cyclin A and cyclin D, two regulators of cell cycle progression that have been implicated in tumorigenesis(25.Wang J. Chenivesse X. Henglein B. Bréchot C. Nature. 1990; 343: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 38.Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). We first investigated the effect of integrin-mediated adhesion to collagen on the expression of cyclin A message. ST2 cells were initially deprived of adhesion for 30 h by transferring the cells to culture dishes coated with polyHEMA, a substance used to inhibit cell attachment (11.Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). By culturing the cells in the absence of adhesion(11.Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 39.Guadagno T.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the effect of adhesion to specific substrates can then be analyzed. Upon transfer from polyHEMA to collagen-coated dishes, the cells expressed low levels of cyclin A (Fig. 5A, lane 1). However, by 18 h on collagen-coated dishes (lane 2), the expected 2.7- and 1.8-kilobase alternatively polyadenylated forms of cyclin A mRNA (25.Wang J. Chenivesse X. Henglein B. Bréchot C. Nature. 1990; 343: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) were induced significantly, and their levels continued to rise 24 (lane 3) and 36 h (lane 4) after plating. To demonstrate that integrin-mediated attachment to collagen was required for induction, in Fig. 5B, the cells were initially deprived of adhesion for 30 h to induce low levels of cyclin A message (lane 1). The cells were then plated on collagen (lane 2 and 3) or maintained on polyHEMA (lane 4 and 5) either in the absence (lane 2 and 4) or the presence of an anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody (lane 3 and 5). After 24 h, cyclin A expression was induced when the cells were plated on collagen (lane 2) but was blocked in the presence of anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody (lane 3). Cells maintained on polyHEMA did not express cyclin A either in the presence or the absence of monoclonal antibody (lanes 4 and 5). The results demonstrated that adhesion to collagen could induce the expression of cyclin A message, and its expression was dependent on β1 integrin-mediated adhesion.Figure 5:Integrin-mediated induction of cyclin A mRNA. A, kinetics of cyclin A induction. After 30 h on polyHEMA, the cells were replated on collagen-coated plates. RNA from 2 × 106 cells were extracted at 0 (lane 1), 18 (lane 2), 24 (lane 3), and 36 (lane 4) h and then analyzed by Northern blot analysis. B, integrin-dependent induction of cyclin A. Cells were transferred to polyHEMA for 30 h (lane 1) and then transferred to collagen-coated dishes (lanes 2 and 3) or maintained on polyHEMA (lanes 4 and 5) in the absence (lanes 2 and 4) or the presence (lanes 3 and 5) of the anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody 33B6 for an additional 36 h in a humidified incubator.

Below each panel shows the corresponding ethidum bromide-stained 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands immobilized to nylon membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The expression of cyclin A, which was regulated by β1 integrin-mediated adhesion, is also known to be regulated by growth factors (serum)(40.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). Also, because C3 induced G0/G1 accumulation (Fig. 4 and Table 1), we compared the effect of C3 treatment, serum withdrawal, and deprivation of adhesion on the expression of cyclins A and D1(26.Xiong Y. Connolly T. Futcher B. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 65: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 38.Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6A, ST2 cells grown on collagen-coated dishes (lane 1) expressed 2.7- and 1.8-kilobase alternatively polyadenylated forms of cyclin A mRNA. When the cells were deprived of adhesion by plating them for 30 h in polyHEMA coated dishes (lane 2) or deprived of serum (lane 3), cyclin A mRNA decreased significantly. The addition of C3 exoenzyme to ST2 plated on collagen also showed reduced cyclin A expression after 30 h (lane 4). The decrease in cyclin A expression in response to deprivation of adhesion, serum starvation, and Rho inactivation by C3 treatment is consistent with the effect of integrins, Rho, and mitogenic factors to regulate proliferation at similar points in the cell cycle(19.Chong L.D.

https://openalex.org/W2011193225,"The eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/RNS2) is a member of the mammalian ribonuclease gene family and is one of four proteins found in the large specific granules of human eosinophilic leukocytes. The gene encoding EDN consists of two exons, including a noncoding exon 1, separated by a single intron from the coding sequence in exon 2. We have identified a functional promoter of the EDN gene and shown that optimal expression depends on interaction between the promoter and one or more sequence elements found in the single intron. Cells of the clone 15 eosinophilic variant of the human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line were transfected with constructs that included the promoter region of the EDN gene alone, promoter with exon 1, and promoter with both exon 1 and the intron positioned 5′ to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (constructs referred to as PrCAT, PrExCAT, and PrExInCAT, respectively). Although reporter gene activity from either PrCAT or PrExCAT was only 2-3 fold higher than baseline (CAT alone), inclusion of the single intron (PrExInCAT) resulted in a 28-fold increase in reporter gene activity in uninduced clone 15 cells, and an 80-fold in activity when clone 15 cells were induced to differentiate toward eosinophils with butyric acid. The intron-mediated enhancer activity was reproduced in other human hematopoietic cell lines (K562, Jurkat, U937, and HL-60), but was not found in human 293 kidney cells, suggesting that the function of the enhancer element(s) may be tissue-specific. A significant portion of the observed enhancer activity resides in the first 60 base pairs the the intron, which includes consensus binding sites for both AP-1 and NF-ATp transcription factors, and a 15-base pair segment that is identical to a sequence found in the promoter of the gene encoding the neutrophil granule protein, lactoferrin.

In the work presented here, we have identified features within the EDN gene that are responsible for promoting gene expression in human cell lines, including at least one functional enhancer element within the characteristic single intron. The human cell lines used in this investigation were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained as indicated. The HL-60, (promyelocytic leukemia), U937, (histocytic lymphoma), Jurkat, (acute T cell leukemia), and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) were all grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. Logan, Utah or Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at pH 7.2. The HL-60 clone 15 promyelocytic leukemia cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPPSO (Sigma) to maintain the pH at 7.6. The human 293 cells, a transformed primary embryonal kidney cell line, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids, Inc.) supplemented as above. All cells were grown at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide in a humidified incubator. The clone 15 cells were induced to differentiate toward the eosinophil lineage with the addition of 0.5 mM butyric acid (BA) (Sigma) to freshly cultured cells at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml as described by Fischkoff and colleagues(16.Plaetinck G. van der Heyden J.

Fifty na nograms of each oligonucleotide probe were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (5000Ci/mmol, ICN, San Diego, CA) and purifed on size exclusion columns (Stratagene). Nylon filters containing RNA were prehybridized (40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 4 × SSC, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 20 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 38°C for 1 h. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added (2 × 106 cpm/ml), and the filters were hybridized at 38°C for 8 h. The hybridized filters were washed with 2 × SSC and 0.5% SDS twice at 42°C and twice at 55°C for 30 min each. Quantitation was performed by densitometric scanning using a Gel Documentation System (UVP, San Gabriel, CA) monitor to image autoradiograms from the Northern blots, followed by analysis with the NIH Image software package. Total RNA harvested from clone 15 cells induced to differentiate with BA for 48 h was used for primer extension experiments. Messenger RNA was purified by polyadenosine selection using a Poly(A) Quik Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's procedure. Poly(A)-selected mRNA was then used in primer extension experiments with the Primer Extension System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). RNA (EDN mRNA or kanamycin-positive kit control) was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and an antisense EDN-specific primer, EDN-1a (see Fig. 1B), corresponding to nucleotides 192 to 175 (5′-TTGCTGGGAGGTCATATT-3′) of the EDN cDNA(7.Rosenberg H.F. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). EDN-1a was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and annealed to the poly(A) selected mRNA prior to reverse transcription. The primer extension reaction was electrophoresed in a denaturing 6% TBE polyacrylamide gel along with known DNA sequence for size determination. The number of nucleotides from the primer to the 5′ end of the mRNA was determined. To determine the precise transcriptional start site, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using mRNA described above with the 5′-AmpliFINDER™ RACE Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was first synthesized from mRNA using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and antisense EDN-specific primers. These primers corresponded to nucleotides 291-274, 5′-ACAAACATTAACTACGTT (EDN-2a) of the EDN probe, nucleotides 341-296, described above, of the EDN cDNA sequence(7.Rosenberg H.F. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). An anchor of known sequence was ligated to the 5′ end of the cDNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (described below) of the anchor ligated cDNA was performed using the supplied anchor primer and a nested primer for each of the antisense EDN primers used to synthesize the cDNA. The nested primer used with the antisense oligonucleotide EDN was EDN-2a, and for EDN-2a the nested primer was EDN-1a, as shown in Fig. 1B. The PCR were performed in a Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp PCR System 9600 using Taq DNA polymerase (5 units) (Boehringer Mannheim) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, buffer containing 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2 uM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 100 ng of each oligonucleotide primer, and 10-50 ng of DNA template. The DNA was denatured for 3 min at 95°C, followed by a three-step PCR reaction: denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at an appropriate temperature for each primer pair for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. After 35 cycles the reactions were extended for an additional 5 min at 72°C followed by cooling to 4°C. PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for dideoxy sequence analysis. EDN genomic clones were isolated from a human lymphocyte genomic library (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) by plaque hybridization with an EDN cDNA radiolabeled probe (7.Rosenberg H.F. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and confirmed by dot blotting with the EDN-1a oligonucleotide (see Fig. 1B) and by dideoxy sequencing. The nucleotide sequence obtained agreed with previously published data (9.Hamann K.J. Ten R.M. Loegering D.A. Jenkins R.B. Hiese M.T. Schad C.R. Pease L.R. Gleich G.J. Barker R.L. Genomics. 1990; 7: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The reporter gene used in these studies was chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as found in the pCAT-basic expression vector (Promega). Various fragments of the 5′ putative promoter region of EDN both with and without additional intron and/or exon sequence were amplified using the following primers (numbered as per (9.Hamann K.J. Ten R.M. Loegering D.A. Jenkins R.B. Hiese M.T. Schad C.R. Pease L.R. Gleich G.J. Barker R.L. Genomics. 1990; 7: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)): 1, 5′-CTGCAGGCAGCATATAGTTTTCAT-3′, nucleotides −312 to −288; 2, 5′-GGTCTCCCCTACTTGGAACT-3′, nucleotides −26 to −45; 3, 5′-CTGTAAGAAAAGAAGAGAAGTAAC-3′, nucleotides 172-149; 4, 5′-CCAGTCTCCGCGCTGTAGC-3′, nucleotides 42-23; 5, 5′-GTAAGTCAACGATCCCCA-3′, nucleotides 43-60; 6, 5′-CCCTCAGTTGCTGCCCCATTG-3′, nucleotides 102-82; 7, 5′-CTTTACTTCCTGTCTGCAAAG-3′, nucleotides 162-142; 8, 5′-ACACACACTGTAGTGTCTTAC, nucleotides 222-202. These primers also contained 5′ PstI or XbaI sites as indicated to facilitate subcloning into the pCAT vectors. For the construct containing promoter plus intron, without exon 1, the primers used were 1 and 9 (nucleotides −26 to −45 with a 5′ XhoI site to amplify the promoter region). The primers 10 (nucleotides 43-60 with a 5′ XhoI site) and 3 were used to amplify the intron sequence. This produced a promoter construct with a XhoI site at its 3′ and an intron construct with the XhoI site at its 5′ end after PCR amplification. The products were gel purified, restriction digested with XhoI, and ligated; the ligation was followed by a second round of PCR amplification using primers 1 and 3 described above. The 520-bp fragment was gel purified and ligated into the pCAT-basic vector. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Cell lines as described above were grown to a density of 0.5 to 1.0 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended to 30 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium as described above for each cell line. Ten to twenty micrograms uncut purified plasmid DNA (using either Qiagen or Promega Maxiprep kit followed by phenol/chloroform extraction) were added to an electroporation cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad) with 15 × 106 cells. The cells were electroporated at a capacitance of 960 microfarads at 250 volts using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The cells were placed on ice for 15 min prior to the addition to 30 ml of complete medium and incubated for 2 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were also electroporated with either 10 μg of uncut control pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) or pCMV-β-galactosidase (Stratagene) vector to control for variation in electroporation efficiency. The level of β-galactosidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically (β-galactosidase assay kit, Promega). CAT activity was normalized to the level of expression of this control vector. CAT assays were performed essentially as described(22.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 9.18-9.37Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested after 2 days of incubation by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 40 mM Tris, pH 7.4, with 1 mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl. Cells were then harvested by a 1-min centrifugation in a microfuge and resuspended in 100-150 μl of 25 mM Tris, pH 8, and disrupted by freeze/thaw, three times on dry ice/37°C water bath. The debris was removed by centrifugation; clarified extract was added to the following reaction mixture: 5-45 μl of extract, 35 μl of 1 M Tris, pH 7.5, 20 μl of 4 mM acetyl Coenzyme A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and 3-5 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (0.25 μCi, DuPont NEN), with distilled H2O added to a final volume of 150 μl. After 6-12 h at 37°C, the [14C]chloramphenicol and acetylated products were extracted by vortexing for 30 s with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer (upper) was removed and air dried under a hood or SpeedVac (Savant), resuspended in 30 μl of ethyl acetate, and applied to a flexible thin layer chromatography sheet (Baker-flex silica gel 1B, J. T. Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ). Separation of acetylated and nonacetylated forms proceeded via a chloroform/methanol (95:5) ascending mobile phase followed by autoradiography. The signals in each lane of the autoradiogram, including all acetylated forms of chloramphenicol, were measured with a System 200 Image Scanner (Bioscan, Inc., Washington, D. C.). Computer analysis of the intronic regions of the EDN gene for consensus transcription factor binding sites was performed using the MacVector sequence analysis program. Comparison of intronic regions with known sequences was performed using the FASTA algorithm of the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group program on-line at the National Institutes of Health. Specific point mutations were introduced into PrExIn by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (23.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotide primer pairs along with primers 1 and 8 as described previously: lfn X (5′ primer, 5′-TCAACGATCCCCTGTGGTCGCAGACAAGGGGCAGCAAT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-ATTGCTGCCCCTTGTCTGCGACCACAGGGGATCGTTGA-3′) and lfn Y (5′ primer, 5′-TCAACGATCCCCAGTCGACCCACAGAAGGGGCAGCAAT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-ATTGCTGCCCCTTCTGTGGGTCGACTGGGGATCGTTGA-3′). The altered sequences were subcloned into pCAT basic as described. All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Expression of mRNA for the EDN in the clone 15 cell line is demonstrated in Fig. 1A. Messenger RNA encoding EDN was detected in uninduced clone 15 cells (lanes 1-7); the level of mRNA accumulating in these cells increased 6-7-fold within 48 h after the addition of 0.5 mM BA (lane 9) as determined by densitometric analysis. Hybridization with a β-actin probe (below) demonstrated relative loading of each lane. Primer extension experiments were undertaken to determine the precise location of the transcriptional start site. RNA from clone 15 cells induced for 2 days with 0.5 mM BA was used for this analysis; a control RNA reaction was included, as was a known DNA sequence for determination of molecular size (Fig. 1C). The band in the +EDN mRNA lane indicated by the arrowhead is the reverse-transcribed product. Comparison of the nucleotides in the known sequence (Std) with the mobility of the band indicated in the +EDN mRNA lane demonstrates that the distance from the primer to the 5′ end of EDN is 219 nucleotides. This result suggests that there are 25 additional nucleotides in the mRNA sequence that had not previously been identified by cDNA cloning(7.Rosenberg H.F. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8.Hamann K.J. Barker R.L. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It was unclear as to whether these additional 25 nucleotides represented a direct extension of exon 1 or a completely distinct exon; RACE was undertaken to make this determination. Using the poly(A)-selected mRNA described for the primer extension experiments, a cDNA strand complementary to the 5′ region of the EDN mRNA was reverse transcribed using the EDN or EDN-2a primers (Fig. 1B), PCR amplified, and subcloned. Numerous colonies were obtained; 18 random colonies were selected for sequencing. The results from a representative sequence are depicted in Fig. 1D. The additional 25-base pair sequence obtained, which follows the anchor sequence and precedes the first exon sequence, is 5′-AGCTGCCCCTGAACCCCAGAACAAC-3′. This sequence matches the published genomic sequence of Hamann and colleagues (9.Hamann K.J. Ten R.M. Loegering D.A. Jenkins R.B. Hiese M.T. Schad C.R. Pease L.R. Gleich G.J. Barker R.L. Genomics. 1990; 7: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that is found immediately 5′ to the previously designated exon 1. These results suggest that the additional nucleotides represent a direct extension of exon 1 as opposed to another distinct exon. The transcriptional start site defined by both primer extension and RACE is located 25 nucleotides 3′ from a consensus TATA box(9.Hamann K.J. Ten R.M. Loegering D.A. Jenkins R.B. Hiese M.T. Schad C.R. Pease L.R. Gleich G.J. Barker R.L. Genomics. 1990; 7: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Of the 18 clones, 11 sequences were as described in Fig. 1D, two were 4 nucleotides shorter at the 5′ end, and five contained unidentified sequences between the PCR primers. The five unidentified clones are assumed to be the result of incorrect priming, because they contained no sequences representing either exon 1 or exon 2. The sequence of the EDN gene positioned 5′ to CAT used in the following experiments are shown in Fig. 2A. The EDN promoter region alone (PrCAT) supported a relatively low level of activity in clone 15 cells, representing 2-3-fold over that of the promotorless CAT (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, the EDN promoter-exon-intron construct (PrExInCAT) supported significantly greater degree of reporter gene activity: 28-fold over CAT in uninduced clone 15 cells and 80-fold over CAT in clone 15 cells grown in the presence of BA (Fig. 2, B and C). The EDN promoter-exon (PrExCAT) construct produced low levels of CAT activity, similar to those of PrCAT alone, suggesting that the dramatic enhancement seen with PrExInCAT was due to sequence elements found in the intron. The intron alone (InCAT) did not demonstrate reporter gene activity above the basal levels in these cells, whereas the EDN promoter-intron combination (PrInCAT) without the first exon provided a 12-fold increase in activity over CAT alone. The increase in activity with promoter and intron and the absence of activity with the intron alone suggests that the enhanced activity depends on interactions between sequence elements in both the promoter and intron. Analysis of CAT activity in several other cell lines is shown in Fig. 3. PrExInCAT was capable of promoting reporter gene activity 20-40-fold over that observed with the CAT in the K562, Jurkat, U-937, and HL-60 human hematopoietic cell lines (Fig. 3). The EDN promoter alone (PrCAT) supported only the lower, basal levels of expression in all cell lines tested. To evaluate regulation in a nonhematopoietic cell line, the PrCAT and PrExInCAT constructs were introduced into the human transformed 293 kidney cell line. Similar to the observations made with the hematopoietic cells, PrCAT induced a basal (2-3-fold) increase in reporter gene activity over CAT in the human kidney cell line. Interestingly, in contrast to the 20-40-fold increase in activity observed in hematopoietic cells, PrExInCAT induced only a 3-fold increase in the kidney cells. This activity was not significantly greater than that induced by PrCAT, suggesting that the enhancer activity provided by the intron may function in a tissue-specific fashion. In order to define the region or regions of the intron that enhance gene expression, truncated promoter-intron constructs were evaluated in clone 15 cells (Fig. 4). The PrEx0.25InCAT and PrEx0.5InCAT constructs, which contain the first 60 and first 120 base pairs of the intron, respectively, were both found to increase reporter gene activity 8-fold over CAT alone. These results suggest that there are one or more functional enhancer elements in the first 60 base pairs of the intron. In contrast, the PrEx0.75InCAT construct, containing the first 180 bp of the intron, produces only a 2.5-fold increase in activity over CAT, suggesting that this region (120 and 180 bp) contains sequence elements that neutralize the effects of the aforementioned functional enhancer(s). Full activity (28-fold over CAT) is restored with the complete intron (PrExInCAT), suggesting the possibility of additional functional enhancers in this final segment of the intron. A sequence map of the EDN gene with a focus on the intron is shown in Fig. 5A. The first 60 bp of the intron contain consensus binding sites for both AP-1 and NF-ATp transcription factors. In addition, there is a segment of 15 bp that is identical to a segment found in the promoter of the lactoferrin gene (see “Discussion”)(24.Johnston J.J. Rintels P. Chung J. Sather J. Benz Jr., E.J. Berliner N. Blood. 1992; 79: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into the sequence of this segment (Fig. 5B), and the PrExInCAT constructs both with and without mutations were evaluated for their ability to support reporter gene activity. Neither set of mutations (lfn X or lfn Y; Fig. 5, B and C) altered the intron-enhancing activity to any significant degree (21- and 35-fold over CAT alone, as compared with 28-fold for the wild type). In the initial phase of this study, we determined the transcriptional start site of the EDN gene. Both primer extension and RACE extended the length of the mRNA to include an additional 25 nucleotides. This additional sequence matched the region of genomic sequence that was directly 5′ to sequence identified as exon 1(9.Hamann K.J. Ten R.M. Loegering D.A. Jenkins R.B. Hiese M.T. Schad C.R. Pease L.R. Gleich G.J. Barker R.L. Genomics. 1990; 7: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, exon 1 has been enlarged to 67 nucleotides, and the two-exon structure of this gene is confirmed. The transcriptional start site is situated appropriately at 23 and 101 base pairs 3′ to consensus TATA and CAAT boxes, respectively. Although significantly more active than either PrCAT or PrExCAT, we found that PrInCAT was not as effective as PrExInCAT in producing reporter gene activity. It is possible that the noncoding exon 1, in conjunction with the intron, plays a specific role in regulating activity of the EDN gene. However, it is also possible that the spatial rearrangement caused by deletion of this 67-base pair segment affects the ability of promoter and intron binding proteins to interact with one another as they interact with the DNA. This point may be clarified once the binding proteins mediating transcription of the EDN gene have been identified. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the enhancer elements present in the EDN intron coordinate specifically with the EDN promoter, or whether they might function equally effectively with other unrelated gene promoters. Although not completely independent (InCAT produced little reporter gene activity in clone 15 cells), the specificity of the interaction between the intron and the EDN promoter has not been established. Investigators have been examining the promoter regions of granule protein genes(1.Gomolin H.I. Yamaguchi Y. Paulpillai A.V. Dvorak L.A. Ackerman S.J. Tenen D.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5014-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in hopes of identifying factors promoting their tissue-specific expression. Our initial results suggest that the function of one or more of the intronic enhancer elements may be tissue-specific. In contrast to the results obtained with the human hematopoietic cell lines, the PrExInCAT construct supported no additional reporter gene activity over that of the promoter alone (PrCAT) in the human kidney cell line. Although preliminary, the increase in activity of PrExInCAT in the hematopoietic cells but not in the kidney cell line suggests that one or more of the functional enhancer elements may interact with a transcription factor expressed in a limited range of human cell types. Sequence analysis of the EDN intron revealed the presence of several consensus sequences for transcription factor binding (Fig. 5). In the first 60 bp of the intron, the region in which a large portion of the enhancing activity resides, there are consensus sequences representing binding sites for transcription factors AP-1 (26.Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar) and NF-ATp(27.Rao A. Immunology Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In addition, a 15-base pair segment that is identical to a sequence found in the 5′ promoter region of the neutrophil-specific granule protein, lactoferrin(24.Johnston J.J. Rintels P. Chung J. Sather J. Benz Jr., E.J. Berliner N. Blood. 1992; 79: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is highlighted. The coordinate control of eosinophil and neutrophil granule protein biosynthesis was suggested by a series of studies examining the rare genetic disorder known as neutrophil specific granule deficiency(28.Gallin J.I. Annu. Rev. Med. 1985; 36: 263-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Gallin J.I. Fletcher M.P. Seligmann B.E. Hoffstein S. Cehrs K. Mounessa N. Blood. 1982; 59: 1317-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lomax and colleagues (30.Lomax K.J. Gallin J.I. Rotrosen D. Raphael G.D. Kaliner M.A. Benz E.J. Boxer L.A. Malech H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) determined that the defective biosynthesis of lactoferrin observed in this disorder resulted from a defect in mRNA transcription affecting specifically cells of the neutrophil lineage. Rosenberg and Gallin (31.Rosenberg H.F. Gallin J.I. Blood. 1993; 82: 268-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the biosynthetic defect could extend to include eosinophils; EDN was among the eosinophil granule proteins affected. Specific mutations introduced into this “lactoferrin site” resulted in no significant alteration in reporter gene activity, suggesting that this segment is not crucial to this specific aspect of EDN gene regulation. Additional investigations using electrophoretic mobility shift assays coupled with DNA footprinting and mutational analysis of additional sites will be necessary to determine the source of the enhancing activity. In summary, this investigation has demonstrated that the intron of the EDN gene contains one or more functional enhancer elements and that interaction between the promoter and these intronic elements is required for the optimal gene expression. Although intronic enhancer elements have been described previously(32.Sawada S. Scarborough J.D. Killeen N. Littman D.R.

This finding takes on considerable significance because the noncoding exon/single intron/coding exon gene structure is shared by all members of this gene family whose gene structures have been determined(9.Hamann K.J.

Although the nucleotide sequences of introns of each of the characterized ribonuclease genes are not overtly homologous to one another (save for EDN and ECP, whose introns are virtually identical(9.Hamann K.J.

https://openalex.org/W2087458258,"cDNA species encoding a large DNA-binding protein (NP220) of 1978 amino acids was isolated from human cDNA libraries. Human NP220 binds to double-stranded DNA fragments by recognizing clusters of cytidines. Immunofluorescent microscopy with antiserum directed against NP220 revealed a punctate or “speckled” pattern and coiled body-like structures in the nucleoplasm of various human cell lines. These structures diffused in the cytoplasm during mitosis. Western blot analysis showed that NP220 is enriched in the lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate-insoluble fraction of nuclei. The domain essential for DNA binding is localized in C-terminal half of NP220. Human NP220 shares three types of domains (MH1, MH2, and MH3) with the acidic nuclear protein, matrin 3 (Belgrader, P., Dey, R., and Berezney, R.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9893-9899). MH1 is a 48-amino acid sequence near the N terminus of both human NP220 and rat matrin 3. MH2 is a 75-amino acid sequence homologous to the RNA recognition motifs of heterogeneous nuclear RNP I and L. It is repeated three times in NP220 and twice in matrin 3. MH3 is a 60-amino acid sequence at the C terminus of both NP220 and matrin 3. NP220 has an arginine/serine-rich domain commonly found in pre-mRNA splicing factors. Close to the domain essential for DNA binding, there are nine repeats of the sequence LVTVDEVIEEEDL. Thus, NP220 is a novel type of nucleoplasmic protein with multiple domains. cDNA species encoding a large DNA-binding protein (NP220) of 1978 amino acids was isolated from human cDNA libraries. Human NP220 binds to double-stranded DNA fragments by recognizing clusters of cytidines.

These structures diffused in the cytoplasm during mitosis. Western blot analysis showed that NP220 is enriched in the lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate-insoluble fraction of nuclei. The domain essential for DNA binding is localized in C-terminal half of NP220. Human NP220 shares three types of domains (MH1, MH2, and MH3) with the acidic nuclear protein, matrin 3 (Belgrader, P., Dey, R., and Berezney, R.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9893-9899). MH1 is a 48-amino acid sequence near the N terminus of both human NP220 and rat matrin 3. MH2 is a 75-amino acid sequence homologous to the RNA recognition motifs of heterogeneous nuclear RNP I and L. It is repeated three times in NP220 and twice in matrin 3. MH3 is a 60-amino acid sequence at the C terminus of both NP220 and matrin 3. NP220 has an arginine/serine-rich domain commonly found in pre-mRNA splicing factors. Close to the domain essential for DNA binding, there are nine repeats of the sequence LVTVDEVIEEEDL. Thus, NP220 is a novel type of nucleoplasmic protein with multiple domains."

The human CETP gene produces two forms of mRNA, with or without exon 9 (E9)-derived sequences. To study the function and regulation of alternative splicing of the CETP gene, transgenic mice were prepared 1) with the metallothionein (mT) promoter driving an E9-deleted construct (mT.CETP(-E9) transgene), and 2) with the natural flanking regions (NFR) controlling expression of genomic sequences which permit alternative splicing of E9 (NFR.CETP(±E9) transgene). With zinc induction, the mT.CETP(-E9) transgene gave rise to abundant E9-deleted CETP mRNA in liver and small intestine, but only relatively small amounts of E9-deleted protein were found in plasma. The E9-deleted form of CETP was inactive in lipid transfer and produced no changes in plasma lipoprotein profile. The NFR.CETP(±E9) transgene gave rise to full-length (FL) and E9-deleted forms of CETP mRNA in liver and spleen. In response to hypercholesterolemia induced by diet and breeding into an apoE gene knock-out background, the FL CETP mRNA was induced more than the E9-deleted mRNA, resulting in a 2-fold increase in ratio of FL/E9-deleted mRNA. The expression of CETP mRNA was found to be developmentally regulated. In NFR.CETP(±E9) transgenic mice CETP mRNA levels were markedly increased in the liver and small intestine in the perinatal period and decreased in adult mice, whereas CETP mRNA in the spleen was low in perinatal mice and increased in adults. The developmental increase in CETP mRNA in the liver and spleen was preceded by an increased ratio of FL/E9-deleted forms. Thus, the E9-deleted mRNA appears to be poorly translated and/or secreted, and the cognate protein is inactive in lipid transfer and lipoprotein metabolism. CETP gene expression was found to be highly regulated in a tissue-specific fashion during development. Increased CETP gene expression during development or in response to hypercholesterolemia is associated with preferential accumulation of the full-length CETP mRNA.

The Tyr-505 → Phe mutant of Lck (F505Lck) exhibits elevated biological activity and constitutive phosphorylation of Tyr-394 in vivo. Mutations at sites of fatty acylation that prevent F505Lck from associating with cellular membranes abolish the biological activity of the molecule in vivo, compromise its activity as a protein kinase in vivo and in vitro, and eliminate the phosphorylation of Tyr-394.

H2O2 treatment induced the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 on catalytically inactive forms of Lck regardless of cellular localization. Phosphorylation of Tyr-394 therefore need not occur by autophosphorylation. Thus, there appear to be two mechanisms through which the phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 can occur.

This interaction is mediated by both myristic acid and palmitic acid that are bound to the amino-terminal glycine and Cys-3 and/or Cys-5, respectively(19.Marchildon G.A. Casnellie J.E. Walsh K.A.

A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Activation of Lck by H2O2 is due to an increase in the phosphorylation of Tyr-394(18.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined the effect of H2O2 on three different non-membrane-bound forms of genetically activated Lck (F505Lck). Non-myristoylated, myristoylated but non-palmitoylated, and nuclear forms of F505Lck all exhibit severely reduced activity in vivo and in vitro. H2O2 is able to restore the in vitro catalytic activity of all three non-membrane-bound forms of Lck. This increase in activity correlates with, and in all probability is due to, an increase in the phosphorylation of Tyr-394. Apparently, phosphorylation of Tyr-394 occurs inefficiently when Lck is located at sites other than cellular membranes but can be induced by elevated levels of oxidants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of lck MutantsAll mutations were introduced into murine lck cDNA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the M13 bacteriophage except for lckS3/5F505, which was constructed by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The construction of lckF505 and lckS3/5F505 has been described(12.Amrein K.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The lcknuc and lcknucF505 mutants were assembled by cloning a 33-base pair synthetic SphI fragment (5′-TCCTAAGAAGAAGCGCAAGGTCGAAGATCCATG-3′) encoding the nuclear localization signal (PKKKRKVEDPC) from SV40 large T antigen (29.Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) into a SphI site in genes encoding lckA2 or lckA2F505 that was generated by changing the codon for Cys-3 (TGT) to (TGC). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. A BamHI-EcoRI restriction fragment of the murine lck cDNA containing the Lys-273 → Arg mutation (18.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was used to replace the corresponding BamHI-EcoRI fragment in genes encoding lcknuc or lckA2 to create lcknucR273 and lckA2R273, respectively. All mutant lck cDNAs were subcloned into the retroviral expression vector LXSN(30.Miller A.D. Rosman G.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant retroviruses were produced by cotransfecting the LXSN constructs and the viral helper plasmid SV-ψ−-E-MLV (31.Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J.

(Mediatech, Washington, D. C.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Gemini, Calabasas, CA) and 600 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). COSm-6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum.Preparation of Cell Lysates and ImmunoprecipitationCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 200 μM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 100 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml aprotinin) for 20 min at 4°C at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. 30 μl of Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin cells; Calbiochem) were added to the lysate, which was then clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × g at 4°C for 45 min. Lck was isolated by the addition of rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for Lck (33.Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar) prebound to S. aureus cells. After adsorption for 30 min, the immune complexes were washed in RIPA buffer three times and once in TN buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells directly in reducing SDS-gel sample buffer at a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml.ImmunoblottingImmunoprecipitated Lck or whole cell lysates were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore).

Labeled Lck was isolated by immunoprecipitation, subjected to gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). The region of the membrane containing Lck was identified by autoradiography, excised, and incubated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone trypsin as described(36.Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 921-924PubMed Google Scholar). Lck that had been autophosphorylated in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP and similarly digested with trypsin was used as a source of labeled tryptic peptide containing Tyr-394. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping was carried out on cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) by electrophoresis at pH 8.9 in the first dimension followed by ascending chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer as described (37.Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 38.Collins T.L. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography.In Vitro Kinase AssaysLck immunoprecipitates were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) and 2 mM Val5-angiotensin II (Star Biochemicals, Torrance, CA) in 20 μl of kinase buffer (40 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mM MnCl2) at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the angiotensin was adsorbed onto Whatman p81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, Fairfield, NJ). The paper was then washed with 0.5% phosphoric acid to remove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphate incorporation into angiotensin was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the p81 paper.Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment of Cells2 × 106 208F cells expressing Lck were seeded in 10 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum onto a 10-cm plate and allowed to recover for 18 h. H2O2 was added directly to the cell medium to a final concentration of 5 mM. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 15 min, washed once with ice-cold isotonic Tris-buffered saline, and lysed directly on the tissue culture dish in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. For experiments in which cells were biosynthetically labeled with 32Pi, the 5-h labeling period (see above) preceded the addition of H2O2 to the media.ImmunofluorescenceApproximately 2 × 106 208F cells expressing Lck were seeded on 25 × 25-mm glass coverslips placed in 35-mm Petri dishes. After 18 h of recovery at 37°C, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 25 μM NaOH. Fixing and all subsequent manipulations were performed at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized with rinse solution (PBS containing 10 mM glycine and 1% Triton X-100) for 10 min, incubated with rabbit anti-Lck antibodies (diluted 1:200 in fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY) containing 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min, washed four times with rinse solution, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein (Jackson Laboratories) (diluted 1:50 in fetal bovine serum), and washed an additional four times in rinse solution. The coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Antibody staining was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.RESULTSA Form of Activated Lck Localized to the Nucleus Does Not Induce an Increase in Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cellular SubstrateTo determine if Lck, which had been both activated by mutation (F505) and retargeted to the nucleus, was able to transform fibroblasts, we constructed a form of Lck in which the nuclear localization signal from SV40 large T antigen was attached to the amino terminus, Gly-2 was mutated to alanine, and Tyr-505 was mutated to phenylalanine. This protein (nucF505Lck) was concentrated in the nucleus when expressed in fibroblasts that express no endogenous Lck (Fig. 1E). In contrast to cells expressing F505Lck, which were highly transformed, cells expressing the nuclear form of activated Lck were not transformed and were indistinguishable from uninfected fibroblasts (data not shown). To determine why nucF505Lck had no transforming activity, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in cells that expressed the mutant protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing nucF505Lck was unchanged from the level observed in uninfected cells (Fig. 2A). This is similar to what is observed in cells expressing A2F505Lck, a non-myristoylated form of activated Lck (17.Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell.

The mutant forms of Lck are expressed at slightly different levels in the 208F cell lines examined here (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the amount of Lck in the immunoprecipitates used for measuring catalytic activity was measured by Western blotting with antibodies to Lck. The data in the figure were normalized to account for differences in Lck levels in the immunoprecipitates. We found that the catalytic activity of nucF505Lck was reduced significantly relative to wild-type Lck and membrane-bound F505Lck (Fig. 3A). This is similar to what has been observed with two other forms of activated Lck not associated with membrane, A2F505Lck and S3/5F505Lck (17.Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell.

The low enzymatic activity of non-membrane-bound forms of Lck almost certainly plays some role in the ability of these proteins to phosphorylate cellular proteins on tyrosine in vivo.Figure 3:In vitro protein kinase activity of non-membrane-bound forms of F505Lck. Mutant Lcks were isolated by immunoprecipitation and assayed in vitro for their ability to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate, Val5-angiotensin II.

Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast to membrane-bound F505Lck, which is highly phosphorylated at this residue, A2F505Lck is poorly phosphorylated at Tyr-394(17.Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphorylation of nucF505Lck and S3/5F505Lck at Tyr-394 was similarly impaired, cells expressing the mutant Lck proteins were labeled biosynthetically with 32Pi, and Lck was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping. The total labeling of S3/5F505Lck and nucF505Lck with 32P was much less than labeling seen in F505Lck, and phosphorylation of Tyr-394 was barely detectable (Fig. 4). nucF505Lck contained several labeled peptides not seen in A2F505Lck or S3/5F505Lck that reflect an increased level of serine and threonine in phosphorylation of Lck that presumably occurs in the nucleus (data not shown). The low activity of non-membrane-bound forms of activated Lck may result from reduced phosphorylation at Tyr-394.Figure 4:Analysis of Lck phosphorylation by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping. Lck was isolated by immunoprecipitation from cells that had been labeled biosynthetically with 32Pi. Lck was purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated horizontally by electrophoresis at pH 8.9 and then vertically by ascending chromatography. The peptides containing Tyr-394 are marked with open arrowheads.

Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To examine whether H2O2 could increase the phosphorylation of Tyr-394 and possibly restore activity to non-membrane-bound forms of Lck, nucF505Lck, S3/5F505Lck, and A2F505Lck were immunoprecipitated from cells before and after exposure to H2O2 and assayed for catalytic activity in vitro. In addition, they were labeled biosynthetically with 32Pi and subjected to two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping. H2O2 exposure resulted in a dramatic increase in the catalytic activity of each mutant (Fig. 3B). Thus, nucF505Lck, S3/5F505Lck, and A2F505Lck have neither unintended intrinsic defects that occurred during mutagenesis nor an inability to be activated. In each case, biosynthetic labeling showed that H2O2 induced the appearance of an additional labeled peptide that comigrated precisely with the peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-394 (Fig. 4). Therefore, as is the case with membrane-bound Lck, H2O2 appears to activate non-membrane-bound forms by stimulating phosphorylation of Tyr-394.Phosphorylation of Non-membrane-associated Forms of Lck at Tyr-394 Need Not Occur through AutophosphorylationTo determine whether phosphorylation of non-membrane-associated Lck at Tyr-394 following exposure to H2O2 was due only to increased autophosphorylation, we asked whether catalytically inactive forms of Lck that were localized to the cytoplasm or nucleus became phosphorylated at Tyr-394 following exposure to H2O2. Mutation of a conserved lysine residue in the ATP phosphate anchor at position 273 to arginine results in a greater than 95% reduction of Lck catalytic activity in vitro(8, 38). ( (2)K. Pierno, unpublished results.) Fibroblasts expressing introduced nucR273Lck or A2R273Lck, but no endogenous Lck, were labeled biosynthetically with 32Pi and then exposed to H2O2. Lck was isolated and subjected to two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping. Both forms of catalytically inactive Lck were phosphorylated at Tyr-505 in untreated cells, but phosphorylation of Tyr-394 was not detectable (Fig. 5, panels A and C). Both mutant proteins became phosphorylated on Tyr-394 following H2O2 treatment as indicated by the appearance of a labeled peptide that comigrated with a marker peptide containing labeled Tyr-394 (Fig. 5, panels B and D, and data not shown).Figure 5:The effect of H2O2 treatment on the phosphorylation of catalytically inactive, non-membrane-associated Lck.

In LPS-induced monocytes, the increase in TF mRNA results from transcriptional activation(8.Niemetz J. Morrison D.C.

A minimal promoter from −111 to +121 mediates basal expression and serum induction in Cos-7 cells(13.Mackman N. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Groupp and M. Donovan-Peluso, manuscript in preparation.) In the present study, we have characterized protein interactions with the TF promoter using nuclear extracts derived from control and LPS-induced THP-1 cells. DNase I footprint analysis showed six regions of nuclease protection and two sites of LPS-induced protein binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), oligonucleotide competitions, and antibody supershift studies were used to characterize the specific proteins that interact with DNA at these sites. Sp1 and Sp3 interact with the promoter in both control and induced extracts. Upon induction there is a change in the AP-1 binding from JunD/Fos in control cells to c-Jun/Fos and JunD/Fos in LPS- induced cells. In contrast to other reports, we have no evidence for NF-κB or Rel binding to the −192 to −172 site; rather, our data suggest that either Ets-1 or Ets-2 binds to this sequence following induction. Finally, in induced nuclear extract, we detect binding of Egr-1 to the consensus site between −85 and −52. These data suggest that LPS stimulation of TF expression results from induction of c-Jun, Ets, and Egr-1 binding to the TF promoter. THP-1 cells (16.Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y.

To monitor induction of TF expression, mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis using a TF cDNA probe. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from cells using methods described previously(18.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

THP-1 cells were centrifuged and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and then in detaching buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 6 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mM spermidine, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain), swelled for 5 min on ice, and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were sedimented at 1000 × g, washed with extraction buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 450 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 6 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain), and incubated in extraction buffer at 4°C for 1 h on a rotating wheel. Insoluble debris was sedimented at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of dilution buffer (extraction buffer minus NaCl) to give a final NaCl concentration of 150 mM. The DNA fragments used as probes in the footprinting analysis were excised by restriction digestion of plasmids that have been described previously(20.Donovan-Peluso M. George L.D. Hassett A.C. J.

These fragments were uniquely end-labeled with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I (Klenow) at either the EcoRI site with [α-32P]dATP or the XbaI site with [α-32P]dCTP.

The samples were digested with DNase I (Worthington) freshly diluted in DNase I dilution buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 60 s, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.2 M NaCl, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by a 1-h incubation at 45°C. Digestion products were extracted with phenol:chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, dried briefly, and resuspended in loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol). Samples were heated to 95°C for 3 min and cooled on ice. The products were resolved on 6% acrylamide-urea gels run in 1 × TBE (0.089 M Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA), transferred to Whatman No. 3MM paper, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleotides used as probes were generated by standard PCR reactions. Oligo 60 (−231 to −172) and Oligo 87 (−231 to −145) were amplified with specific primers, using the l67-bp fragment as a template. Oligo 60 was amplified with GGCGCGGTTGAATCACTGGG (coding primer) and GTCCCGGAGTTTCCTACCGGG (noncoding primer); Oligo 87 was amplified with GGCGCGGTTGAATCACTGGG (coding primer) and GGGCAGGGGTGTTGGACTCG (noncoding primer).

In supershift studies, binding reactions were performed as described above, followed by a 1-1.5-h incubation on ice with the specific antibody. DNase I footprinting analysis was performed to visualize protein-DNA interactions within the TF promoter. In Fig. 1, protein interactions with the 224-bp fragment containing the upstream region (−383 to −280) fused to the downstream region (−113 to +8) demonstrate two footprints. Footprint I (−85 to −52) is inducible when control and LPS-induced extracts are compared. Footprint II (−105 to −90) is present with both control and induced extract on the coding strand (Fig. 1A); however, stronger protection is seen with induced extract on the noncoding strand (Fig. 1B). Although other regions of this probe display differences in nuclease sensitivity when extracts containing protein are compared with the DNase control lane, the patterns of cleavage with control and induced extracts are very similar, suggesting that those proteins do not change with induction. Reduced cleavage of nucleotides between −50 and the mRNA start site (Fig. 1A) may result from binding of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase to sequences in this region. Footprints generated with the l67-bp probe (−280 to −113) are shown in Fig. 2. Protein(s) derived from both control and induced extracts generated footprint III (−150 to −120), although induced extracts protected this region of DNA slightly more efficiently. Proteins that protected the nucleotides within footprints IV and VI were present in both control and induced extracts. In contrast, footprint V was only detected when LPS-induced extracts were used. In addition, a strong DNase I-hypersensitive site, located at −197, appeared at the junction of footprints V and VI on the coding strand with the LPS-induced extracts. As summarized in Fig. 3, footprints IV (−175 to −153), V (−197 to −175), and VI (−220 to −197) contain consensus binding sites for numerous proteins. The perturbations in DNase I cleavage visualized when control and induced nuclear extracts are compared suggest that LPS may qualitatively or quantitatively affect the proteins available to interact with these sequences.Figure 3:Summary of DNase I protection analysis. Footprints are numbered I-VI. The bracketed regions below roman numerals display footprinted regions. Numbers flanking each footprint designate the protected nucleotide sequences relative to the TF cap site. Transcription factor consensus sequences identified by computer-assisted searches are displayed below the relevant footprints. PCR-generated probes used in EMSAs are shown below the binding site homologies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify nuclear proteins that interacted with the footprinted regions, EMSAs were performed. These studies focused on two regions that contained inducible footprints and appeared to change most dramatically following LPS induction, the distal region (−231 to −172) and the proximal region (−99 to −47). The probes used in these studies are indicated in Fig. 3, which also shows the region of the promoter, transcription factor consensus sites, and footprints contained in each oligonucleotide. Oligo 60, which contains two AP-1 sites and an overlapping NF-κB/Rel/Ets site, interacts with proteins in both control and induced extracts, and there was a qualitative difference in the pattern of migration of the complexes (data not shown). In order to improve these binding studies, Oligo 87 (−231 to −145) was synthesized to extend the region slightly and include an Sp1 sequence (−167 to −162) and a CACCC sequence (−157 to −153). Competitive gel shift analysis performed with Oligo 87 is displayed in Fig. 4. Specific binding to this probe was detected with both control and induced extracts, although the induced extract produced a broader area of protein-DNA complex migration. Binding was specific as indicated by the effective competition of a 100 × molar excess of unlabeled probe. The addition of a 100 × molar excess of an AP-1 consensus oligo competed for most of the binding activity; an Sp1 consensus oligo competed for some of the binding activity in the LPS-induced extract, and the combination of both the AP-1 and Sp1 effectively competed for binding in both control and LPS-induced extracts. No competition was observed with the NF-κB or Ets consensus oligos. Most of the binding to Oligo 60 was also competed with the AP-1 consensus oligo, although no competition was observed when consensus oligos for NF-κB, Ets, or Sp1 were included in the binding reaction (data not shown). Antibody supershift assays were performed with Oligos 60 and 87 to characterize the transcription factors interacting with this region (Fig. 5). Induced extract contains an increased level of binding to these probes, which may contribute to the difference in mobility of protein-DNA complexes seen when control and induced extracts are compared. In Fig. 5A, proteins bound to Oligo 60 were recognized by antibodies against both the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors since these antibodies supershifted the protein-DNA complexes (indicated by arrows to the right of the EMSA). The α-Jun antibody effectively supershifted the entire binding complex with the control extract and also produced a supershifted complex with the LPS-induced extract, although this complex was more diffuse and there was residual binding that was not completely supershifted. The α-Fos antibody also produced supershifted complexes with both the control and induced extracts. These supershifted complexes appeared to be similar in both the control and induced extracts; however, this complex appeared to slightly more abundant with the LPS-induced extract. α-Jun and α-Fos antibodies together supershifted all of the binding complexes that recognized Oligo 60. The binding complexes formed with Oligo 87 were tested with the same α-Jun and α-Fos antisera (Fig. 5B). Although both antibodies produced supershifted complexes when tested separately and in combination, there was residual binding activity present in both control and induced extracts. The protein complexes formed with Oligo 87 were tested with additional antibodies (Fig. 5C), and the incubations were extended to 90 min to increase the sensitivity of the assay. The longer incubation resulted in the appearance of a slower migrating complex which was much stronger with induced extract (indicated by the dot to the right of the EMSA). Both α-Sp1 and α-Jun antisera produced a supershifted complex indicated by the arrow at the right of C. Neither α-Rel nor α-NF-κB (data not shown) antibodies were able to recognize proteins that interacted with Oligo 87. In contrast, the α-Ets antibody abrogated the binding of the upper complex which formed upon longer incubations. This higher mobility complex was also missing in reactions containing LPS-induced extract and the α-Sp1 and α-Jun antisera. Since the TF promoter contains two AP-1 consensus sequences, we were unable to determine whether or not Jun homodimers, Jun-Fos heterodimers, or a mixture of both were present in the control and induced nuclear extracts using either Oligo 60 or Oligo 87 (Fig. 5). Fig. 6 demonstrates the results of EMSA with a probe containing a single AP-1 consensus site. These data suggest that all of the AP-1 binding activity consists of Jun-Fos heterodimers, since the α-Fos antisera supershifts all of the complexes in both control and induced extracts with both Oligo 60 (Fig. 5A) and a probe containing a single AP-1 site (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 also demonstrates the activation of c-Jun binding activity in THP-1 cells induced with LPS. In order to determine whether different Jun family members were binding to the TF promoter in control and induced nuclear extracts, a panel of α-Jun antibodies was tested for reactivity against AP-1 complexes that bound to Oligo 87 (Fig. 7). The pan-Jun antiserum supershifted complexes in both control and induced extracts. The α-JunD effectively supershifted the entire complex with control extracts (indicated by the bracket at the left) but left residual binding with LPS-induced extracts (indicated by the dotted line at the right). Incubation of induced extracts with a combination of α-c-Jun and α-JunD effectively supershifted the entire complex.Figure 7:Supershift assays using Oligo 87.

Diagram below EMSA indicates the relative location of consensus binding sites within the probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As summarized in Fig. 3, Oligo 53, which spans the inducible footprint I, contains consensus sequences for Egr-1/2, AP-2, and two Sp1 sites, one of which overlaps the Egr-1/2 site. EMSAs with Oligo 53 are shown in Fig. 8. With control extract, two specific bands are produced indicated by the solid arrows. The lower band was competed by cold Oligo 53, and an Sp1 consensus oligo competed for binding to both bands. The induced extract produced an additional complex that migrated between these two bands, indicated by the open arrow. The addition of cold Oligo 53 effectively competed for the binding activity and reduced the intensity of this LPS-inducible complex. As a nonspecific competitor, an oligo for the Ets binding site was included in the binding reaction and was ineffective. A combination of the Ets and Sp1 competitor oligos was as effective as Sp1 alone at titrating the binding to this oligo. Since one Sp1 consensus site (−78 to −71) overlaps the Egr consensus site (−81 to −73), an additional competition experiment was performed to test the effect of increasing the concentration of cold Sp1 consensus oligo on the binding of the complex that was observed with LPS induction (Fig. 8B). As the concentration of cold Sp1 competitor increased from 200 to 400 × (lanes 3 and 4), the intensity of this inducible band appeared to increase. A further increase in concentration of cold Sp1 to 800 × actually reduced binding of the inducible band, which may be due to nonspecific effects of excess DNA in the binding reaction. Antibody supershifts were performed with Oligo 53 (Fig. 8C). α-Sp1 produced a supershifted complex with both the control and induced extracts. With LPS-induced extract, α-Egr-1 abrogated the binding of the inducible complex. As a nonspecific control, α-Ets-1/2 had no effect on any of the complexes formed with this probe.

Phosphorylation of c-Jun on serine and threonine at three sites in the carboxyl terminus just upstream of the basic region, by casein-kinase II and glycogen synthase kinase-3, prevents AP-1 binding(31.Nikolakaki E.

https://openalex.org/W2079711272,"Mycobacterium strain TMC 5135, which has been proposed as a vaccine against both leprosy and tuberculosis, is considered to be a strain of serotype I of the recognized species Mycobacterium simiae. We have now shown that each of these strains possesses characteristic polar glycopeptidolipids (GPL) which are sufficiently different to allow unequivocal strain identification. Thin layer chromatographic analysis demonstrated that M. habana synthesizes a family of apolar GPLs and three distinct polar GPLs (pGPL-I to -III) which exhibited migration patterns different from those of M. simiae serotype I (pGPL-Sim). Using a combination of chemical, mass spectrometric, and proton-NMR analyses, the GPLs from M. habana were determined to be based on the same generic structure as those from the M. avium complex, namely N-fatty acyl-D-Phe-(O-saccharide)-D-allo-Thr-D-Ala-L-alaninyl-O-m onosaccharide. The de-O-acetylated apolar GPLs contain a 3-O-Me-6-deoxy-Tal attached to the allo-Thr and either a 3-O-Me-Rha or a 3,4-di-O-Me-Rha attached to the alaninol. In the pGPLs, oligosaccharides were found to be attached to the allo-Thr. The oligoglycosyl alditol reductively released from the least polar pGPL-I was fully characterized as L-Fucp alpha 1 in --7 with 3-(6-O-Me)-D-Glcp beta 1 in --7 with 3-(4-O-Me)-L-Rhap alpha 1 in --7 with 3-L-Rhap alpha 1 in --7 with 2-(3-O-Me)-6-deoxy-Tal. In pGPl-II and -III, the terminal Fuc residue is further 3-O-methylated and 4-O-substituted with an additional 2,4-di-O-Me-D-GlcA and 4-O-Me-D-GlcA, respectively. The corresponding oligosaccharide from pGPL-Sim was shown to be of identical molecular weight to pGPL-II but terminating with a 3,4-di-O-Me-GlcA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based serological studies using anti-M. habana and anti-M. simiae sera against whole cells and purified pGPLs firmly established the polar GPLs as important antigens and indicated that the terminal epitopes L-Fuc-, 2,4-di-O-Me-D-GlcA, and 4-O-Me-D-GlcA uniquely present in pGPL-I, -II, and -III, respectively, confer sufficient specificity for the identification of M. habana as a distinct serotype of M. simiae."

A human SIG81 sequence >80% identical with the mouse cDNA was deduced from homologous sequences in the human expressed tags data base. The deduced amino-terminal region shows features common to mitochondrial targeting sequences. A phylogenetic analysis of the carboxyl-terminal domain homologous to COX7a identifies SIG81 as a divergent member of the family with an ancient origin. Southern blot analysis showed that the mouse genome contains two to three copies of the SIG81 gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the SIG81 transcript is approximately 1 kb and expressed in every tissue tested, with higher levels of expression observed in kidney and liver. Antibodies raised against a glutathione S-transferase SIG81 fusion protein detected a 13.5-kDa protein that co-fractionates with mitochondrial localized enzymatic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2042122545,"Melanoma-associated genes (MAGEs) encode tumor-specific antigens that can be recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. To investigate the interaction of the HLA-A1-restricted MAGE-1 peptide 161-169 (EADPTGHSY) with HLA class I molecules, photoreactive derivatives were prepared by single amino acid substitution with Nβ-[iodo-4-azidosalicyloyl]-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid. These derivatives were tested for their ability to bind to, and to photoaffinity-label, HLA-A1 on C1R.A1 cells. Only the derivatives containing the photoreactive amino acid in position 1 or 7 fulfilled both criteria. Testing the former derivative on 14 lymphoid cell lines expressing over 44 different HLA class I molecules indicated that it efficiently photoaffinity-labeled not only HLA-A1, but possibly also HLA-A29 and HLA-B44.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 247-259PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study we utilized HLA class I photoaffinity labeling to investigate whether HLA-A1 binding MAGE peptides can also bind to other HLA molecules. We have previously shown that the interaction of antigenic peptides with MHC class I molecules can be assessed on cells by photoaffinity labeling(13.Luescher I.F. Romero P. Cerottini J.-C. Maryanski J.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14.Luescher I.F. López J.A. Malissen B. Cerottini J.-C. J.

In the systems studied so far, MHC class I photoaffinity labeling was remarkably allele-specific. Moreover, the lack of significant labeling of other cellular components made possible the analysis of photoaffinity labeling by direct SDS-PAGE of lysates of labeled cells(13.Luescher I.F. Romero P. Cerottini J.-C. Maryanski J.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14.Luescher I.F. López J.A. Malissen B. Cerottini J.-C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1003-1011PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Anjuère F. Layer A. Cerottini J.-C. Servis C. Luescher I.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The main limitation of this approach was the synthesis and identification of suitable photoreactive and radiolabeled peptide derivatives. To overcome this difficulty we have recently introduced a novel synthesis strategy that permits the preparation of such peptide derivatives by automated solid phase peptide synthesis in which single amino acids are replaced with photoreactive Nβ-[iodo-4-azidosalicyloyl]-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dap(IASA))(15.Anjuère F. Layer A. Cerottini J.-C. Servis C. Luescher I.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Here we show that suitable HLA binding photoreactive derivatives of MAGE-1 and −3 peptides can be identified by systematic testing of single Dap(IASA)-substituted peptides. Photoaffinity labeling experiments revealed that the MAGE-3 peptides 168-176 and 167-176, as well as homologous MAGE peptides, can bind not only to HLA-A1 but also to HLA-A29 and HLA-B44. This photoaffinity labeling approach, combined with molecular modeling, constitutes a straightforward means to identify overlapping peptide binding by HLA class I molecules.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and TransfectantsMost of the cell lines were generous gifts from different laboratories (as described under “Acknowledgments”). The homozygous EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines were described at the 10th International HLA Workshop(16.Dupont B. Immunobiology of HLA. 1. Springer-Verlag, New York1987Google Scholar, 17.Levine J.E. Young S.Y. Tissue Antigens. 1994; 44: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C1R transfectants were prepared by transfecting C1R cells, which express no significant levels of HLA-A and -B proteins and very low levels of HLA-Cw4(18.Alexander J. Payne J.A. Murray R. Frelinger J.A. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), with expression vectors encoding HLA-A1, -A29, or -B4403 essentially as described(29.Fleischhauer K. Kernan N.A. O'Reilly R.J. DuPont B. Young Yang S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1818-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 30.Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a vector encoding HLA-Cw∗1601 using lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were used 24 h after transfection. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with L-glutamine and 5% fetal calf serum.Peptide and Conjugate SynthesisReagents for peptide and conjugate synthesis were obtained from Novabiochem (Lucerne, Switzerland), Bachem Finechemicals (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and Fluka AG (Buchs, Switzerland). General reagents were from Sigma Chemie (Buchs, Switzerland). All synthetic procedures were performed essentially as described previously(15.Anjuère F. Layer A. Cerottini J.-C. Servis C. Luescher I.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In brief, the photoreactive MAGE-1 peptide derivatives were prepared in two steps. In the first step the peptide derivatives containing Dap(ASA) and phosphorylated tyrosine (i.e. Dap(ASA)-ADPTGHSY(PO3H2)) were synthesized by conventional solid phase peptide synthesis, based on the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy. In the second step these derivatives were subjected to chloramine T iodination with 125I or nonradioactive iodine and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase(15.Anjuère F. Layer A. Cerottini J.-C. Servis C. Luescher I.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The iodinated peptide derivatives were HPLC-purified on a C-18 reverse phase column (4 × 250-mm, 5-μm particle size; Vydac Inc., Hisperia, AZ). Upon eluting the column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, rising within 1 h from 0 to 75%, the derivative MAGE-1 E161Dap(IASA) (E161X) eluted after 27.2 min, A162X after 26.9 min, P164X after 26.5 min, T165X after 28.4 min, G166X after 26.4 min, H167X after 28.7 min, and S168X after 28.4 min. Dap(IASA) derivatives of the MAGE-3 peptides 168-176 and 167-176 (MEVDPIGHLY) were prepared likewise. While the decapeptide derivatives eluted only slightly later (<1 min) from the HPLC column than the corresponding nonapeptide derivatives, they all eluted considerably later than the homologous MAGE-1 peptide derivatives. The MAGE-3 decapeptide derivative M167X eluted after 40.1 min, V169X after 35.7 min, D170X after 40.5 min, P171X after 36 min, I172X after 34.5 min, G173X after 36.4 min, H174X after 39.4 min, and L175X after 35.2 min. All peptides and conjugates were analyzed by mass spectrometry on a LDI 1700 mass spectrometer (Linear Scientific Inc., Reno, NV) and by UV spectrometry on an in-line 1000S diode array UV spectrometer (ABI, Foster City, CA). All Dap(ASA) peptide derivatives displayed the expected UV absorption maxima at 214, 270, and 310 nm and after iodination at 214, 272, and 325 nm. The observed Mr corresponded with the calculated Mr, but in most cases a second Mr was also observed. The mass difference was always 26 and probably is explained by a decomposition of the photoreactive group brought about by the laser pulse. The radioactive peptide derivatives had a specific radioactivity of approximately 2000 Ci/mmol, and their aqueous solutions of 0.7-1.1 × 106 cpm/μl were used within 1 week.Photoaffinity LabelingAll labeling procedures were performed essentially as described previously(13.Luescher I.F. Romero P. Cerottini J.-C. Maryanski J.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14.Luescher I.F. López J.A. Malissen B. Cerottini J.-C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1003-1011PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Anjuère F. Layer A. Cerottini J.-C. Servis C. Luescher I.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (6 × 106/ml) were resuspended in RPMI 1640, supplemented with HEPES (10 mM) and 10% X-vivo-10 medium (Whittaker, Walkersville, MD), and incubated in 1-ml aliquots with the iodinated peptide derivative (2 × 107 cpm/ml) and human β2-microglobulin (2.5 μg/ml; Sigma) in 6-well plates (Costar) at 26°C for 3-4 h. Photoactivation was induced by UV irradiation for 2 min with a 15-W mercury fluorescence lamp emitting at 365 ± 40 nm (Bioblock, Illkirch, France). After the addition of protease inhibitors (leupeptin, iodoacetamide, and PMSF) and HEPES (50 mM) the cells were lysed at 0-4°C with Nonidet P-40 (0.7% final concentration), and the detergent-soluble fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with W6/32 mAb(22.Brodsky F.M. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the UV-irradiated cells were washed 3 times with 15 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1 time with phosphate-buffered saline. The immunoprecipitates or cell pellets were boiled in reducing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% linear gels, which following drying were evaluated by autoradiography and densitometry as described(14.Luescher I.F. López J.A. Malissen B. Cerottini J.-C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1003-1011PubMed Google Scholar). All incubations were performed in triplicates, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. Standard deviations were calculated according to the Student's t test from at least three different experiments.Functional Competition AssayThe ability of the MAGE-1 peptide 161-169 and its photoreactive derivatives to bind to HLA-A1 was assessed in a recognition-based competition assay, as described previously(4.Gaugler B. Van den Eynde B. van der Bruggen P. Romero P. Gaforio J.J. De Plaen E. Lethé B. Brasseur F. Boon T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 13.Luescher I.F. Romero P. Cerottini J.-C. Maryanski J.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14.Luescher I.F. López J.A. Malissen B. Cerottini J.-C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1003-1011PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 51Cr-labeled C1R.A1 cells were incubated in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of the MAGE-3 peptide 168-176 with cloned HLA-A1-restricted MAGE-3-specific 20/38 CTLs(4.Gaugler B. Van den Eynde B. van der Bruggen P. Romero P. Gaforio J.J. De Plaen E. Lethé B. Brasseur F. Boon T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The concentration of the MAGE-1 161-169 peptide that resulted in 50% inhibition of the specific lysis was defined as 1, and the HLA-A1 competitor activities of the MAGE-1 peptide derivatives were expressed relative to this value.Molecular ModelingAn average framework for the α1 and α2 domains of MHC class I molecules was constructed from structures available in the Protein Data Bank data base (HLA-A2, HLA-B27, HLA-Aw68, and H-2Kb). Models for the α1 and α2 domains of other class I alleles were built from this framework using the ProMod knowledge-based modeling package(19.Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, a new carbon backbone was fitted onto the framework based on a primary sequence alignment optimized for three-dimensional similarity. Loop regions were reconstructed by structural homology searches through the Protein Data Bank, and missing side chains were rebuilt using a library of allowed rotamers. Similarly, an averaged framework for MHC-bound peptides was constructed from structures available from the Protein Data Bank, including the complexes of HLA-A2 with the peptides human immunodeficiency virus gp 120 195-207, hepatitis B nucleocapside 18-27, influenza A matrix protein 58-66, human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase 309-317, or human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 tax 11-19 and H-2Kb with the peptides vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein 52-59 or Sendai virus nucleoprotein 324-332. Peptides of interest were fitted onto this framework using ProMod. The resulting crude models of MHC-peptide complexes were subjected to rigid body energy minimization, 200 steps of Powell minimization with constrained α-carbons, and 200 steps of Powell minimization without constraints, using the X-PLOR package with the PARAM 11 parameter set. In order to assess peptide conformations with potentially lower free energies, the following molecular dynamics simulations were used: the peptide-MHC complex was heated to 300 K in steps of 10 K, the peptide was allowed to move freely for 10-100 ps at this temperature, and the complex was cooled again to 0 K. As before, the X-PLOR package and the PARAM 11 parameter data set was used. The resulting models were subjected to additional refinement using the ICM software. Optimal conformations for side chains of both MHC and peptide were searched by a biased Monte Carlo procedure (20.Abagyan R. Trotrov M. Kuznetsov D. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1343) Google Scholar) at 2000 K, carried out simultaneously with local deformation of the peptide backbone and Brownian movements of the whole peptide molecule with an amplitude of 2 Å. For each model, 500,000 energy function simulations were calculated. The energetically lowest conformation for each model was considered as final. The final models were examined for consistency with known rules of peptide-MHC complex structure, such as hydrogen bond formation and electrostatic interactions of the terminal amino and carboxyl groups of the peptide, and the presence of the canonical peptide binding pockets on the floor of the peptide-binding site(21.Young A.C.M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28.Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar).RESULTSAbility of Photoreactive MAGE-1 Peptide Derivatives to Bind to and to Photoaffinity Label HLA-A1To identify an HLA-A1 photoprobe, derivatives of the MAGE-1 peptide 161-169 were prepared by single amino acid substitution with photoreactive Dap(IASA). As shown in Fig. 1A, all amino acids were substituted except the HLA-A1 anchor residues Asp-161 and Tyr-169. The ability of these conjugates to bind to HLA-A1 was assessed in a recognition-based competition assay. The concentration of the MAGE-1 peptide causing 50% inhibition of the lysis of 51Cr-labeled target cells sensitized with the MAGE-3 peptide 168-176, by an HLA-A1-restricted MAGE-3-specific CTL clone, was defined as 1. The competitor activities of the MAGE-1 peptide derivatives were expressed relative to this value. Only the derivative containing Dap(IASA) in P2 displayed a considerably (100-fold) reduced binding to HLA-A1 and thus was not further examined.The remaining derivatives were tested for their ability to photoaffinity label HLA-A1 molecules on HLA-A1-transfected C1R cells (C1R.A1) (Fig. 1B). Following incubation of these cells with the radioiodinated peptide derivatives and UV irradiation, cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The derivatives containing Dap(IASA) in P1 or P7 efficiently labeled a material that migrated with an apparent Mr of approximately 45 kDa (lanes 1 and 5, respectively). The derivatives containing Dap(IASA) in P4 or P5 weakly labeled this component, whereas the remaining two derivatives failed to do so (lanes 2-4 and 6). This labeled material could be immunoprecipitated with the W6/32 mAb (data not shown). Since this mAb immunoprecipitates all HLA class I molecules (22.Brodsky F.M. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar) and HLA-A1 is the only HLA molecule significantly expressed by this C1R transfectant(18.Alexander J. Payne J.A. Murray R. Frelinger J.A. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), this 45-kDa material is the HLA-A1 heavy chain. Indeed, untransfected C1R cells displayed no detectable HLA labeling (data not shown).It is worth noting that the different MAGE-1 peptide derivatives also weakly labeled materials with apparent molecular mass of approximately 70, 96, and 150 kDa, respectively. It is conceivable that at least some of these are heat shock proteins, which have been reported to bind peptides(23.Srivastava P.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 62: 153-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the different photoprobes labeled these species with different intensities relative to HLA-A1, it is likely that the underlying binding principles are different.The MAGE-1 Peptide Derivative Dap(IASA)-ADPTGHSY Apparently Also Photoaffinity-labeled HLA-A29 and HLA-B44The MAGE-1 peptide derivative Dap(IASA)-ADPTGHSY, which efficiently bound to and photoaffinity-labeled HLA-A1, was chosen to screen a panel of 14 lymphoblastoid B cell lines expressing over 44 different HLA-class I molecules. These cells were subjected to the same labeling procedure as described for Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 2A, significant photoaffinity labeling of a 45-kDa material was observed only in the case of the EBV-transformed cell lines BM21 (lane 1), MOU (lane 4), LG2 (lane 11) and 807-02 (lane 15). Labeling of this 45-kDa material was not detectable on the other lines tested (lanes 2, 3, 5-10, and 12-14). The labeled materials were immunoprecipitable with W6/32 mAb and hence correspond to HLA class I heavy chains (data not shown).Figure 2:Photoaffinity labeling of different cell lines with Dap(IASA)-ADPTGHSY. Fifteen different cell lines were subjected to photoaffinity labeling with Dap(125IASA)-ADPTGHSY and analyzed as described for Fig. 1B (A). The HLA class I molecule expression of the cell lines is summarized in panel B. The first nine were HLA homozygous EBV-transformed cell lines that have been described at the 10th International Histocompatibility Workshop (16.Dupont B. Immunobiology of HLA. 1. Springer-Verlag, New York1987Google Scholar) (workshop numbers are indicated as ws#), and their HLA-C expression has been determined by polymerase chain reaction(18.Alexander J. Payne J.A. Murray R. Frelinger J.A. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The heterozygous EBV-transformed cell lines were derived from HLA-typed individuals. In the case of HLA-C this serological typing was incomplete, as indicated by question marks. The remaining cell line was COS-7 cells transfected with HLA-Cw∗1601.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)While the HLA photoaffinity labeling on BM21 cells, which express HLA-A1, was expected, the labeling observed on MOU cells, which express HLA-A∗2902, HLA-B∗4403, and HLA-Cw∗1601 (Fig. 2B), was unexpected. As suggested by the similarly efficient HLA labeling observed on 807-02 cells, which express HLA-A29 but not HLA-B44 or HLA-Cw∗1601, this peptide derivative apparently also photoaffinity-labeled HLA-A29. HLA-Cw∗1601 labeling could be ruled out, since COS-7 cells transfected with HLA-A1, but not with HLA-Cw∗1601, displayed HLA labeling (lane 14 and data not shown). This is consistent with the finding that an HLA-Cw∗1601-restricted MAGE-1 peptide (SAYGEPRKL) displayed no similarity with the HLA-A1-binding MAGE peptides ((24.van der Bruggen P. Szikora J.-P. Boël P. Wildmann C. Somville M. Sensi M. Boon T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2134-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and Fig. 3).Figure 3:Partial amino acid sequences of the MAGE-1-, MAGE-2-, MAGE-3-, MAGE-4a-, MAGE-4b-, MAGE-6-, and MAGE-12-encoded antigens. The homologous sequences that bind to HLA-A1 and HLA-29 are shown in black boxes and gray cassettes, respectively, and the corresponding decapeptides that bind to HLA-B44 are shown in black cassettes. The differences in the amino acid numbers among the different MAGE sequences originate from amino acid inserts or deletions in the first quarter of the sequences(1.De Plaen E. Arden K. Traversari C. Gaforio J.J. Szikora J.-P. Desmet C. Brasseur F. van der Bruggen P. Lethé B. Lurquin C. Brasseur R. Chomez P. Debacker O. Cavenee W. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The weak labeling observed on LG2 cells (lane 11) suggested that Dap(IASA)-ADPTGHSY also photoaffinity-labeled HLA-B44. However, the possibility could not be ruled out that the labeled HLA molecule was another HLA-C allele that could not be typed by serology (Fig. 2A).HLA-A29 and HLA-B44 Photoaffinity Labeling by Photoreactive MAGE-3 Peptide DerivativesTo obtain further information on the HLA photoaffinity labeling observed with Dap(IASA)-ADPTGHLY on LG2 and 807-02 cells, competition experiments were performed. Neither labeling was well inhibited by the parental MAGE-1 peptide 161-169, indicating that the Dap(IASA) modification of this peptide considerably increased its binding to the HLA molecules labeled on these cells. In addition, these experiments indicated that the MAGE-3 peptide 168-176 (EVDPIGHLY) was a better competitor than the MAGE-1 peptide 161-169 (data not shown). To find out whether the MAGE-1 161-169 and homologous peptides encoded by other MAGEs (Fig. 3) indeed bind to HLA-A29, we assessed the ability of all possible single Dap(IASA)-substituted MAGE-3 168-176 peptide derivatives to photoaffinity label HLA-A29 on C1R.A29 transfectants. Three derivatives efficiently photoaffinity-labeled HLA-A29, namely those containing Dap(IASA) in P1, P6, and P7, respectively. The labeling by EVDPIDap(IASA)HLY, but not by the other derivatives, was efficiently inhibited by the parental peptide (Fig. 4B and data not shown).Figure 4:Binding of MAGE-encoded peptides to HLA-A1, HLA-A29, and HLA-B∗4403. C1R.A1 cells were incubated with radioiodinated MAGE-1 peptide derivative Dap(IASA)-ADPTGHSY in the absence or presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the indicated MAGE peptides (A). Alternatively, analogous experiments were performed by using C1R.A29 cells and the MAGE-3 nonapeptide derivative EVDPI-Dap(IASA)-HLY (B) or C1R.B∗4403 cells and the MAGE-3 decapeptide derivative MEVDPIG-Dap(IASA)-LY (C).

https://openalex.org/W2046821441,"Digestion of vesicle-bound SecA by trypsin entrapped within the vesicles showed that refolding precursor ribose-binding protein (pRBP) of Escherichia coli retards the lipid bilayer penetration by SecA while the signal peptide enhances it. This discrepancy was found to be due to reduced SecA binding to the vesicles in the presence of the pRBP while the signal peptide induced a tight binding. Studies on the binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) to SecA indicated that SecA assumes more closed conformation upon interaction with pRBP and signal peptide induces more open structure of SecA. Kinetic studies of ANS binding to SecA upon dilution of unfolded pRBP with SecA solution showed an initial fast ANS binding, which was followed by a slow release of ANS. This suggests that first the signal peptide portion of the pRBP binds with the SecA making its structure more open and then the subsequent binding of the mature domain makes the SecA structure more compact. The pRBP enhanced the digestion of SecA added to the E. coli inverted vesicles, suggesting an inhibition of SecA penetration while the signal peptide had an opposite effect, agreeing with the results from the model systems above. When the pRBP and ATP were present together, however, the penetration of SecA increased dramatically underlining the importance of the SecY/E complex for the membrane insertion of SecA. Digestion of vesicle-bound SecA by trypsin entrapped within the vesicles showed that refolding precursor ribose-binding protein (pRBP) of Escherichia coli retards the lipid bilayer penetration by SecA while the signal peptide enhances it. This discrepancy was found to be due to reduced SecA binding to the vesicles in the presence of the pRBP while the signal peptide induced a tight binding. Studies on the binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) to SecA indicated that SecA assumes more closed conformation upon interaction with pRBP and signal peptide induces more open structure of SecA. Kinetic studies of ANS binding to SecA upon dilution of unfolded pRBP with SecA solution showed an initial fast ANS binding, which was followed by a slow release of ANS. This suggests that first the signal peptide portion of the pRBP binds with the SecA making its structure more open and then the subsequent binding of the mature domain makes the SecA structure more compact. The pRBP enhanced the digestion of SecA added to the E. coli inverted vesicles, suggesting an inhibition of SecA penetration while the signal peptide had an opposite effect, agreeing with the results from the model systems above. When the pRBP and ATP were present together, however, the penetration of SecA increased dramatically underlining the importance of the SecY/E complex for the membrane insertion of SecA."

To gain insight into the mechanism of this regulation, we studied the effects of glucocorticoids on the synthesis of two components of the secretory granule membrane, the glycoprotein 2 (GP-2) and the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). It was demonstrated that following adrenalectomy, degranulation of pancreatic acinar cells is accompanied by a sharp decrease in GGT and GP-2 synthesis as measured by mRNA and protein accumulation. The decline of GGT synthesis was prevented by glucocorticoid replacement therapy, whereas GP-2 synthesis could be maintained with either glucocorticoid or estradiol treatment. These in vivo observations were corroborated and extended in an in vitro study using AR42J pancreatic cells. With this cell line, it was demonstrated that dexamethasone induces the formation of zymogen granules and the accumulation of a specific GGT transcript (mRNA III) by decreasing its degradation rate. At the same time, the GP-2 mRNA level was not modified by the hormonal treatment. These data demonstrate that glucocorticoids exert a positive control on the GGT expression in pancreatic cells at a post-transcriptional level. GGT, an enzyme of the glutathione metabolism, could play a significant role in protein packaging in secretory cells.

GGT, an enzyme of the glutathione metabolism, could play a significant role in protein packaging in secretory cells. In eukaryotic cells, newly synthesized secretory proteins are sequestered in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and delivered to the Golgi apparatus. At the trans-side of the Golgi, most of the secretory proteins are packaged into secretory granules, a storage compartment. Upon stimulation, the granules move to the cell apex and release their content by exocytosis(1.Beaudoin A.R. Grondin G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 177-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2.Arvan P. Castle J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite a considerable amount of progress in our understanding of the intracellular trafficking of secretory proteins, the mechanisms by which they are packaged and maintained in an osmotically inactive form in the zymogen granule (ZG) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: ZGzymogen granuleGP-2glycoprotein 2GGTγ-glutamyl transpeptidasePBSphosphate-buffered salinekbkilobasebpbase pair(s)GSHglutathioneGSSGglutathione disulfide.) is unknown. Possible clues for the elucidation of these processes come from experiments which reported that adrenalectomy of male rats caused a marked depletion of ZG in the pancreas acinar cells, an effect which was reversed by treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid, triamcinolone(3.Grossman A. Boctor A.M. Lane B. Endocrinology. 1969; 85: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4.Beaudoin A.R. Grondin G. St-Jean P. Vachereau A. Cabana C. Grossman A. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was also found that a dexamethasone treatment of the AR42J rat pancreatic cells induces the appearance of ZG(5.Logsdon C.D. Moessner J. Williams J.A. Goldfine I.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These observations led us to the hypothesis that glucocorticoids were directly involved in the packaging of secretory proteins and ZG formation. zymogen granule glycoprotein 2 γ-glutamyl transpeptidase phosphate-buffered saline kilobase base pair(s) glutathione glutathione disulfide. Glucocorticoids could influence the packaging of secretory proteins and ZG formation through the ZG membrane protein content. The latter membrane is a highly specialized membrane; it contains, roughly, 10 major proteins and shows a rather limited spectrum of polypeptides(6.Ronzio R.A. Kronquist K.E. Lewis D.S. MacDonald R.J. Mohrlok S.H. O'Donnell Jr., J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 508: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7.Pâquet M.R. St-Jean P. Roberge M. Beaudoin A.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 28: 20-26PubMed Google Scholar), with a significant overlapping composition to membranes from other exocrine glands, irrespective of the nature of stored proteins(8.Cameron R.S. Cameron P.L. Castle D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1299-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein 2 (GP-2) is one of the major components of this membrane; it is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (9.LeBel D. Beattie M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10.Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is released in the pancreatic ducts upon cleavage with a phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase. The released GP-2 polymerizes and forms a fibrillar network(11.Grondin G. St-Jean P. Beaudoin A.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Laforest L. St-Jean P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The physiological role of GP-2 is not yet defined, but this fibrillar network may form a barrier to colonization of the pancreatic duct by intestinal bacteria. In addition, recent studies have shown that GP-2 shares some antigenic determinants and structural homology with a phospholipase A2(13.Withiam-Leitch M. Aletta J.M. Koshlukova S.E. Rupp G. Beaudoin A.R. Rubin R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is another glycoprotein component of the secretory granule membranes, which has been used as a marker to follow their isolation by subcellular fractionation(8.Cameron R.S. Cameron P.L. Castle D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1299-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the exocrine pancreas, we localized GGT, which is a type II membrane protein, in the ZG membrane, the apical membrane and pancreatic juice (14.Beaudoin A.R. Grondin G. Laperche Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) where it is associated with “pancreasomes” (12.Laforest L. St-Jean P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 15.Battistini B. Chailler P. Brière N. Beaudoin A.R. Life Sci. 1990; 47: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GGT hydrolyzes glutathione, which may affect the disulfide bridges of the proteins with high cysteine content, like GP2, along the secretory pathway(16.Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Biochemical and immunocytochemical observations have indicated that both GP-2 and GGT are continuously released by the pancreas acinar cell in the pancreatic juice, and, hence, a substantial fraction of these proteins do not follow its host membrane that recycles after exocytosis(11.Grondin G. St-Jean P. Beaudoin A.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Laforest L. St-Jean P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This implies a de novo synthesis of these proteins and their insertion into the recycled membrane as new granules form. If these proteins are essential for protein packaging and ZG formation, therefore, one could postulate an increase in their rate of synthesis when ZG formation is induced by glucocorticoids(4.Beaudoin A.R. Grondin G. St-Jean P. Vachereau A. Cabana C. Grossman A. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The study of the expression of these two very different membrane proteins is now greatly facilitated as a result of cloning and sequencing of their respective cDNAs(10.Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11536-11543Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GP-2 protein is also encoded by a single copy gene, but only one species of mRNA is transcribed(10.Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Fukuoka S.H. Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2898-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that in acinar cells, glucocorticoid treatment induces in parallel ZG formation and GGT expression. The GGT regulation occurs at a post-transcriptional level since glucocorticoids induce the accumulation of the GGT mRNA III transcript by decreasing its degradation. We also provide evidence that ZG formation can be induced independently of GP-2 expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing approximately 200 g, were used for these experiments. The animals were maintained on 0.9% saline drinking solution in addition to standard lab chow. They were divided in four groups of 10 animals, 1) sham-operated, 2) adrenalectomized, 3) adrenalectomized with a dexamethasone replacement therapy, 4) adrenalectomized with an estradiol replacement therapy. The experiments lasted 5 days starting with surgery on day 0. The following day, the rats on a replacement therapy received the hormone for 4 days. The animals were fasted overnight prior to their sacrifice on the 5th day. For the glucocorticoid replacement therapy, the animals were given 0.09 mg of dexamethasone in propylene glycol (Organon, Toronto, Canada), and for the estradiol replacement therapy, the animals received 0.042 mg of estradiol in propylene glycol (Sigma) as daily subcutaneous injections. The rats were decapitated and the pancreases quickly excised. Small pieces of tissues chosen at random in different regions of the gland were immediately fixed for morphological observations or used for GGT assay or RNA preparation. Livers were also excised from 18-day-old fetuses and from adult rats. Kidneys were obtained from adult rats and mammary glands from lactating female rats. The AR42J pancreatic carcinoma cells (CRL 1492) were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). The cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dishes and grown for 4 days in modified Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Cambridge, U. K.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml fungizone, before different periods of treatment by 10 or 100 nM dexamethasone. In some experiments, the anti-glucocorticoid RU-38486 (gift from Roussel-Uclaf, France) was added to the dexamethasone-treated cells at a 0.5 mM concentration. Cells were lysed directly into 1.5 ml of 4 M guanidium thiocyanate per dish for RNA extraction or washed two times in cold PBS and scraped for GGT assay, Western blot analysis, or nuclei purification. Cell pellets and pieces of pancreas tissues were processed for electron microscopy as described previously (4.Beaudoin A.R. Grondin G. St-Jean P. Vachereau A. Cabana C. Grossman A. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized in water with a Potter-Elvehjem, and AR42J cells were washed, scraped, and suspended in PBS. The GGT activity was determined according to Orlowski and Meister (25.Orlowski M. Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as unit/mg protein. One unit corresponds to 1 μmol of product formed per min at 37°C. Proteins were assessed according to Bradford(26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Pancreases were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments) in 45 mM Tris saline buffer, pH 7.6, and centrifuged at 700 × g for 15 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor. Supernatants were decanted and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman S.W.41 rotor. The pellets were suspended in 5 mM Tris, 5% glycerol, pH 7.6. AR42J cells were washed and scraped in PBS; pellets were suspended in 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were estimated according to Bradford(26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Samples (100 μg) were resuspended in loading buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli(27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue and GP-2 immunoblotting carried out as described previously(28.Sevigny J. Cote Y.P. Beaudoin A.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from rat tissues or AR42J cells using the guanidium thiocyanate procedure(29.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA were obtained by two successive purifications on an oligo(dT) column as described previously(19.Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Lebargy F. Kurauchi O. Darbouy M. Bernaudin J.F. Guellaën G. Barouki R. Laperche Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2352-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or using the microspin oligo(dT) column (RNA-Flash from Bioprobe Systems, Montreuil-sous-bois, France) when the amount of total RNA was less than 2 mg. The poly(A)+ RNA samples were resolved on an 1.5% agarose denaturing gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham, France), and hybridized to GGT and GP-2 probes as described previously(19.Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Lebargy F. Kurauchi O. Darbouy M. Bernaudin J.F. Guellaën G. Barouki R. Laperche Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2352-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were also hybridized to a β-actin probe to assess the amount of sample loaded on the gel. The labeled GGT complementary RNA (cRNA) probes, which hybridize specifically to the GGT mRNA I (cRNA-17), mRNA II (cRNA-12), mRNA III (cRNA-3), or to all the GGT mRNA types (cRNA-139A), were synthesized by in vitro transcription of the GGT plasmids pGEM-17, pGEM-12, FL2, or pGEM4-139 as described elsewhere (19.Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Lebargy F. Kurauchi O. Darbouy M. Bernaudin J.F. Guellaën G. Barouki R. Laperche Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2352-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Brouillet A.

These plasmids were linearized by NsiI (pGEM-17), HincII (pGEM-12), or SacI (FL2 and pGEM4-139) prior to their transcription from the T7 promoter in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, except for FL2 which was transcribed from its SP6 promoter. The GP-2 cRNA probe was obtained from a GP-2 recombinant plasmid (10.Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. C. Rindler. The coding sequence, from the nucleotide 174 to the nucleotide 1607, was subcloned into pGEM-4 (Promega, Madison) and digested by EcoRI and BamHI. The recombinant plasmid was then linearized by EcoRI and transcribed from its T7 promoter. The β-actin probe was obtained by labeling the 800-bp HindIII-KpnI cDNA fragment(30.Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), using the megaprime labeling kit (Amersham, France) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP. Nuclei were prepared as described previously(31.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Nascent RNA transcripts were labeled with [α-32P]UTP, isolated, and quantitated according to Antras et al.(32.Antras J. Lasnier F. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1157-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled RNA (10 × 106 cpm) was hybridized to an Hybond membrane where either 10 μg of control pGEM-3Zf(+) DNA (Promega, Madison) or 3 μg of GP-2 cDNA, 2 μg of amylase cDNA, and 1.7 μg of a 470-bp GGT genomic sequence have been immobilized. This latter 470-bp GGT sequence was obtained from the plasmid pGEM-III(22.Brouillet A. Darbouy M. Okamoto T. Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Garlatti M. Goodspeed D. Laperche Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14878-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it contains the 58 nucleotides at the 3′end of the GGT mRNA III leader exon and extends 412 nucleotides downstream in the first intron. The 0.9-kb amylase cDNA sequence cloned into the plasmid pBR322 (33.MacDonald R.J. Crerar M. Swain W.F. Pictet R.L. Thomas G. Rutter W.F. Nature. 1980; 287: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. R. J. MacDonald. After hybridization, the blots were autoradiographed, and densitometric quantification of the signals was carried out using a Laser densitometer Ultroscan XL (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). The AR42J cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM dexamethasone prior to the addition of actinomycin D (1.25 μg/ml) for different periods of time. The total RNA was extracted, and aliquots (10-40 μg) were used to assess the amount of GGT mRNA III-specific sequences by an RNase protection assay using the Ambion kit (Clinisciences, Montrouge, France). The cRNA-3 probe (362 bases) was transcribed from the GGT plasmid FL2 linearized by EcoRI. The probe was purified on a 5% acrylamide, 8 M urea gel and eluted; 250,000 cpm of labeled cRNA were coprecipitated with each RNA sample. The pellets were resuspended in 80% deionized formamide, 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA. Hybridization was performed overnight at 55°C. The hybridization products were digested by the RNase A and T1 for 30 min at 37°C, treated as described in the kit procedure, and loaded on a 5% acrylamide, 8 M urea gel. The gel was run for 2 h at 50 watts, dried, and autoradiographed. Densitometric quantification was performed using a Laser densitometer Ultroscan XL (Pharmacia). Films were exposed for different periods of time in order to measure the intensity of the signal in a linear range. As illustrated by representative micrographs (Fig. 1, A-D), a decrease in the number of ZG was observed in the pancreatic acinar cells of adrenalectomized rats (Fig. 1B) as compared with the number found in cells from control animals (Fig. 1A). There is no noticeable difference between the pancreases of the adrenalectomized group (Fig. 1B) and those of animals receiving estradiol as a replacement therapy (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the animals of the adrenalectomized group that received a replacement therapy with dexamethasone (Fig. 1D) exhibited an increase in the number of ZG in the pancreas, as compared with the controls. In control AR42J cells, there were only few small size granules (Fig. 2A). Dexamethasone treatment induces the appearance of ZG of different sizes (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Effect of dexamethasone on granulation of AR42J cells. A, control AR42J cells. Few ZG are found in these cells where nucleus (NU) occupy a large volume (× 9900). B, AR42J cells treated with 10−7M dexamethasone during 48 h.

RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In adrenalectomized rats, the pancreatic GGT activity (102 ± 21 milliunits/mg protein) is decreased by about 50% as compared with sham-operated animals (210 ± 35 milliunits/mg protein). Administration of dexamethasone results in a significant (p < 0.001) recovery of the GGT activity (142 ± 25 milliunits/mg protein), whereas an estradiol replacement therapy is without effect on GGT activity (93 ± 20 milliunits/mg protein) that remains at the level found in adrenalectomized animals. The influence of glucocorticoids on GGT activity was also measured in vitro in the pancreatic adenocarcinoma AR42J cells. Incubation of these cells for 24 h, in the presence of 10−8, 10−7, and 10−6M dexamethasone, enhances the GGT activity from 5 milliunits/mg protein (basal level) to 12, 17, and 17 milliunits/mg protein, respectively; this indicates that the dexamethasone effect is maximal at 10−7M. Culture of AR42J cells at 10−7M dexamethasone for different periods of time up to 72 h reveals that, after a latent period of 12 h, the GGT activity increases sharply reaching a value that represents 20 times the basal level after a 3-day treatment (Fig. 3). In experiments where the anti-glucocorticoid RU-38486 was added to the culture medium, the increase in GGT activity was minimal (4 milliunits/mg protein) as compared with the basal level (2 milliunits/mg protein). Treatment with estradiol was without effect on GGT activity (data not shown). These in vivo and in vitro data show that GGT activity in the pancreas acinar cells is under the control of glucocorticoids. The higher amplitude of the GGT regulation observed in AR42J cells as compared with the pancreas in vivo might be explained by differences in the hormone concentration in contact with pancreatic cells. In vitro, AR42J cells were treated with 10−7M dexamethasone, a concentration that induces granulation of these cells as well as maximal induction of GGT activity. The glucocorticoid concentration achieved in the pancreas in vivo during the hormonal therapy might be lower. GP-2 protein level was measured by the Western blot technique on protein extracts prepared from pancreas and AR42J cells. The general pattern of the proteins appears to be similar among the different samples (Fig. 4). Immunoblotting with GP-2 polyclonal antibodies reveals a single band in control pancreatic extracts. This band exhibits an apparent molecular weight of 78,000 that corresponds to the glycosylated GP2. This polypeptide cannot be detected in the pancreas of adrenalectomized animals, but it reappears following a glucocorticoid replacement therapy (Fig. 4). No GP-2 polypeptide can be detected in AR42J protein extracts even when granule formation has been stimulated by glucocorticoids (Fig. 4). Northern blot analysis of pancreatic mRNA prepared from animals with different glucocorticoid status was carried out with the cRNA probe 139A that recognizes all the different GGT mRNA species(20.Darbouy M. Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Okamoto T. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Laperche Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1130-C1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization of this probe to the poly (A+) RNA from sham-operated animals (Fig. 5A) reveals a major band which co-migrates with the 2.4-kb GGT band detected in the fetal liver. The 2.4-kb GGT band almost completely disappears in samples from adrenalectomized rats. Administration of dexamethasone to adrenalectomized animals not only prevents the disappearance of this GGT band but also increases its intensity as compared with controls. In contrast, the estradiol replacement therapy does not significantly affect the GGT mRNA level in the pancreas of adrenalectomized rats. A second hybridization of these mRNA samples with an actin probe shows comparable mRNA loading in the four pancreas samples (Fig. 5B). The mRNA samples were further analyzed by hybridization to the cRNA-3 probe specific for the 5′-untranslated sequence unique to the GGT mRNA III (Fig. 5C). This hybridization firmly identifies the 2.4-kb band as the GGT mRNA III previously found in fetal liver and lactating mammary gland(22.Brouillet A. Darbouy M. Okamoto T. Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Garlatti M. Goodspeed D. Laperche Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14878-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA III accumulation is under a positive glucocorticoid control since the effect of adrenalectomy is largely compensated by a dexamethasone therapy, whereas estradiol exhibits only a slight effect. The band corresponding to a low molecular weight poly(A+) RNA revealed by the cRNA-3 probe in the fetal liver sample (Fig. 5C) has been observed in earlier studies(22.Brouillet A. Darbouy M. Okamoto T. Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Garlatti M. Goodspeed D. Laperche Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14878-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 1.6-kb poly(A+) RNA is not detected by the GGT probe 139A corresponding to the GGT coding sequence, and the length of this message is shorter than the GGT reading frame. Therefore, this message cannot encode a GGT polypeptide. The interpretation is that a piece of sequence in the GGT mRNA III-specific 5′-untranslated region, used as the probe, may be highly homologous to a sequence present in an unidentified RNA species expressed in the fetal liver. A second GGT band was also observed in pancreas samples from sham-operated animals (Fig. 5A). This band corresponds to a GGT mRNA species that migrates in the gel at a slightly higher rate than the GGT mRNA III. Hybridization to the cRNA-12 probe identifies this mRNA as the GGT mRNA II species that migrates at 2.2 kb (19.Chobert M.N. Lahuna O. Lebargy F. Kurauchi O. Darbouy M. Bernaudin J.F. Guellaën G. Barouki R. Laperche Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2352-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5D). It is not expressed in the pancreas of adrenalectomized animals and is not restored by glucocorticoid replacement therapy. To determine whether the GGT mRNA III accumulation in pancreatic cells was under a direct control by glucocorticoids, GGT mRNA accumulation was measured in the AR42J cells. When cultured in the absence of hormone, these cells express the 2.4-kb GGT mRNA at a low level, as revealed by the hybridization to the cRNA-139A probe (Fig. 5A). Addition of 100 nM dexamethasone to the culture medium for 2 days induces a strong increase in the expression of this mRNA species (Fig. 5A), identified as the GGT mRNA III species by hybridization to the cRNA-3 probe (Fig. 5C). Hybridization to the cRNA-12 probe does not reveal any clear signal in AR42J cells (Fig. 5D). Control hybridization to an actin probe shows that equal amounts of RNA were loaded on both lanes (Fig. 5B). Northern blot analysis clearly shows that the increase in the GGT enzyme activity induced by glucocorticoids in pancreatic cells results from the accumulation of the GGT mRNA III. GP-2 mRNA expression was analyzed in AR42J cells, pancreas, and in other rat tissues. A strong signal corresponding to the 1.9-kb GP-2 mRNA (10.Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is obtained in the pancreas from sham-operated rats (Fig. 6A). This signal is markedly decreased in the adrenalectomized group, whereas treatment with dexamethasone increases the GP-2 mRNA to a level that is higher than in the control group. Replacement therapy with estradiol also prevents a decrease of GP-2 mRNA level in adrenalectomized rats. A control hybridization with the actin probe (Fig. 6B) does not reveal inequal mRNA loading. No GP-2 mRNA sequences are detected in samples from fetal liver (Fig. 6A) or in adult liver, lactating mammary g"

Structural and functional studies on cyanomet valency hybrids have suggested that cyanide-bound ferric heme mimics natural oxyheme, thus deoxy-cyanomet valency hybrid Hbs have been used as models for the intermediate species formed during the cooperative oxygenation process(13.Szabo A.

However, since conventional met-Hb reducing reagents and enzymatic reduction systems reduce the cyanomet heme, it is very difficult to carry out the experiments using deoxy-cyanomet valency hybrids under anaerobic conditions. Thus, there have been no reports on x-ray crystallography of cyanomet valency hybrids because of this difficulty. During recent years, we have investigated the properties of metal-substituted hybrid Hbs, α2(M)β2(Fe) and α2(Fe)β2(M), using the first transition metal ions (M). This metal substitution method is the most suitable modification of Hb A for studying the relationships between the functional states of Hb A and globin-metalloporphyrins interaction. In our systematic investigations, we have observed a wide variation of oxygen affinities in these hybrids, as a result of the variation in the configuration of 3d electrons of the porphyrin metal. With respect to the oxygen affinity of metal-Fe(II) hybrids, we can classify these hybrids into following four groups: (i) hybrids showing oxygen affinities as high as oxy-Hb A, (ii) hybrids showing intermediate oxygen affinities, between oxy-Hb A and deoxy-Hb A, (iii) hybrids showing affinities as low as deoxy-Hb A, (iv) hybrids showing lower oxygen affinities than deoxy-Hb A. To represent the oxygenation intermediates of Hb A, the hybrids in group (i) and (iii) are particularly important. In our recent series of studies, Ni(II)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs in group (iii) have been used successfully to investigate the structures and functions of the intermediates appearing in the first half oxygenation of Hb A(21.Alston K.

Although the Ni(II)-Fe(II) hybrid system has brought much structural and functional information about the initial-half oxygenated intermediates, this approach could not be extended to studies on the latter-half oxygenation of Hb A. Stable hybrids in group (i) were required to model the intermediates appearing in the oxygenation of the last two sites of Hb A. This paper reports the preparation and oxygen equilibrium properties of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs. It also shows that these Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrids are an excellent model for the intermediates appearing in the oxygenation of the last two sites of Hb A. The influence of Cr(III)PPIX on the oxygen equilibrium properties of ferrous subunits within Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs results in quantitative similarities with oxygenated heme under various conditions. This view is reinforced by other structural results, namely (i) similar porphyrin geometry and metal-histidine bonds between Cr(III)PPIX and natural oxyheme, and (ii) the occupation of the sixth coordination position of Cr(III)PPIX by H2O (or OH―) so that the substitution of oxyheme with H2O bound Cr(III)PPIX may not significantly alter the heme-pocket structure. With respect to the ease of experiments under anaerobic conditions, Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs have several advantages over cyanomet valency hybrid Hbs as stable and useful models for the oxygenation intermediates. Cr(III)PPIX was prepared as described by Hori et al.(29.Hori H. Tsubaki M. Yu N.-T. Yonetani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hb A and its isolated chains, semihemoglobin α and semihemoglobin β, were prepared in carbon monoxide forms as described by Fujii et al.(30.Fujii M. Hori H. Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15386-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation method for Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs was essentially similar to that for Ni(II)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs (22.Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Miyazaki G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31.Shibayama N. Imai K. Hirata H. Hiraiwa H. Morimoto H. Saigo S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8158-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and that for Porphyrin-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs(30.Fujii M. Hori H. Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15386-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of α2(Cr)β2(Fe-O2) was carried out as follows. Bound CO was removed from semihemoglobin β by the method of Kilmartin and Rossi-Bernardi(32.Kilmartin J.V. Rossi-Bernardi L. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The spectrophotometric titration of semihemoglobin β with Cr(III)PPIX at 440 nm gave a well defined inflection point, from which the molecular stoichiometry of 1:1 was estimated. The solution of semihemoglobin β in oxy form (500 mg) was mixed with an equimolar amount of Cr(III)PPIX, which was dissolved in a minimal amount of N,N‘-dimethylformamide. The mixture was stirred at 4°C for 2 h and then concentrated by ultrafiltration and passed through a Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.85. The sample was applied on a column of CM52 cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted by a linear gradient of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.10, and 15 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.45. A main peak corresponding to α2(Cr)β2(Fe-O2) was collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The concentrated sample was passed through a column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2 and stored in liquid nitrogen (yield, 150 mg). Preparation of α2(Fe-O2)β2(Cr) was carried out by the same procedure described above, using corresponding constituents, Cr(III)PPIX, and semihemoglobin α. For the preparation of CrHb, apo-Hb was used. The apo-Hb was prepared from native Hb A as described by Shibayama et al.(22.Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Miyazaki G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The apo-Hb was combined with an equimolar amount of Cr(III)PPIX, and the reconstituted CrHb was purified by the purification procedure described above. All of the preparative works and subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4°C. All of the samples containing Cr(III)PPIX were treated in the dark, because of their light sensitivity. ( (2)We found that Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs that had been irradiated with a 100-watt incandescent bulb for 30 min for removal of bound CO showed very high affinity for oxygen with little Bohr effect or little IHP effect. In addition, it was found that when Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs and CrHb were exposed to strong light during isoelectric focusing, these samples gave broad bands. We have not found out the exact cause of such light-induced damage to Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs, but it is likely that some globin moiety of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs were damaged by O2 radical produced by interaction between strong light and Cr(III)PPIX. Since we found this problem, we have prepared Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs in O2 form, and we have taken care that Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs are not exposed to strong light.Note that Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs are not damaged by the spectrometer beam for measuring oxygen equilibrium curves. To confirm the stabilities of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs against monochromatic light in spectrophotometers, we measured the oxygen equilibrium curves of the hybrids twice in succession in the presence of met-heme reduction systems, there was no difference between the two measurements in the range of standard error.) The purities of all the Hbs were checked by isoelectric-focusing electrophoresis (Pharmacia). Oxygen equilibrium curves were measured as described by Imai et al.(33.Imai K. Morimoto H. Kotani M. Watari H. Hirata W. Kuroda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 200: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 34.Imai K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our automatic oxygenation apparatus was interfaced to a microcomputer (Nippon Electric Co., Tokyo) for on-line data acquisition, storage, and analysis. Light-path length of the cell was variable in this apparatus and was set at 15 mm in the case of 60 μM and 12 μM (on a metal basis) or at 8 mm in the case of 240 μM (on a metal basis). The concentration of Hb samples and the pH conditions used in this study are listed (see Table 1). Measurements were carried out at 25°C in 50 mM bis-Tris or Tris buffer with 100 mM chloride. The optical absorbance change during the successive deoxygenation and reoxygenation was monitored by a Shimadzu UV-2200 spectrophotometer at 560 nm in the case of 240 and 60 μM (on a metal basis) or at 430 nm in the case of 12 μM (on a metal basis). In order to maintain the met-Hb formation at minimal levels, catalase and superoxide dismutase(35.Lynch R.E. Lee G.R. Cartwright G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Winterbourn C.C. McGrath B.M. Carrel R.W. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), or an enzymatic reduction system that was composed of an NADPH generating system and a ferredoxin electron mediating system(37.Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), were added into the Hb samples. The met-heme contents after the measurement were estimated from the absorbance change at 630 nm by the addition of a small amount of a potassium cyanide solution into the measured samples(30.Fujii M. Hori H. Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15386-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deoxygenation data were used for two-step Adair analysis. The reaction between Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs and oxygen molecules is expressed by the following two-step equilibria: Hb+202⇆HbO2+O2⇆Hb(O2) 2(Eq. 1) Tabled 1 The first and second intrinsic Adair constants, Ki (i = 1 and 2; in torr–1), is written as: Ki=i[Hb(O2) i](2−(i−1))[Hb(O2) i−1]p(Eq. 2) p is the partial pressure of oxygen. i/(2 - (i - 1)) is a statistical factor, because the binding of O2 to Hb(O2)i−1 is statistically enhanced by a factor of the number of empty sites, 2 - (i - 1), and the release of O2 from Hb(O2)i is statistically enhanced by a factor depending on the number of filled sites, i. Fractional saturation with oxygen is expressed as Y: Y=[HbO2]+2[Hb(O2) 2]2[Hb]+2[Hb(O2)]+2[Hb(O2) 2]=K1p+K1K2p21+2K1p+K1K2p2(Eq. 3) is the Adair equation used to analyze the data. The best fit values of the first and second intrinsic Adair constants, Ki, were obtained by fitting a two-step Adair equation to each deoxygenation curve through a least-squares procedure (38.Imai K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 470-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra ware recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2200A spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto). Millimolar extinction coefficients were calculated on a basis of the protein concentration determined by the Lowry method (39.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autooxidation rates were measured using the techniques described by Brantley et al.(40.Brantley Jr., R.E. Smerdon S.J. Wilkinson A.J. Singleton E.W. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6995-7010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation of the sample was followed by recording the increase in absorbance at 410 nm. Measurements were carried out at 37°C in air equilibrated 50 mM Tris buffer with 100 mM chloride. Protein concentration was 200 μM (on a metal basis), and 1-mm light path cells were used. Crystallization of deoxy-Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs was carried out as described by Ward et al.(41.Ward K.B. Wishner B.C. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for native deoxy-Hb A crystals. Crystallization was carried out under N2 atmosphere in the presence of polyethylene glycol 1000 (25-30%), 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 50 mM dithionite. Fig. 1 presents the isoelectric focusing of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs in CO form and Hb A in CO form and CrHb. α2(Mn3+)β2(Fe-CO) (42.Waterman M.R. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5847-5852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α chain are shown as controls. Each hybrid Hb appears as a nearly single band. CrHb and the hybrid Hbs migrate toward the higher pH region compared with Hb A, due to the presence of trivalent Cr(III)PPIX. The pH dependence of the absorption spectrum of CrHb is presented in Fig. 2A. Upon raising pH from 6.5 to 8.4, the Soret peak shifted from 445 to 439 nm, and a visible peak at 764 nm shifted to 752 nm. In the range of pH 6.5-8.4, the isosbestic points were reproducibly observed at 748, 720, 441, and 407 nm. The absorption spectrum of CrHb was not affected by the presence of either 50 mM dithionite under anaerobic condition or the enzymatic reduction system of Hayashi et al.(37.Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), indicating that Cr(III)PPIX in CrHb was not reduced to Cr(II)PPIX by these reductants. Thus, the oxygen equilibrium curves of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs could be measured with enzymatic reduction system in order to reduce the met-heme contents to a minimal level. Moreover, absorption spectra of deoxygenated Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs under anaerobic condition in the presence of 50 mM dithionite did not change remarkably for 96 h at 20°C except decreasing of dithionite absorption (Fig. 3). After these measurements, CO could reasonably bind to the ferrous subunits of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs (Fig. 3). Autooxidation rate of ferrous subunits of α2(Cr)β2(Fe-O2) and α2(Fe-O2)β2(Cr) were measured by detecting 410-nm absorbance change in air equilibrated buffer, 37°C condition (Fig. 4). Precipitate did not appear. The autooxidation rates of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs were comparable with that of Hb A under the same condition (Fig. 4), meaning that ferrous subunits of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs were as stable as those of Hb A against autooxidation. Thus, we conclude that Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs have enough stability for our oxygen equilibrium and crystallization experiments. The sum of the absorption spectra of α2(Cr)β2(Fe-O2) and α2(Fe-O2)β2(Cr) was almost identical to that of oxy-Hb A and CrHb. (Fig. 2, B and C). Oxy-deoxy difference spectrum of each Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hb agrees closely with that of isolated α or β chain. These findings mean that Cr(III) subunits do not bind oxygen molecules and that the absorption spectra of Cr(III) subunits are not affected by the ligation state of the corresponding ferrous subunits within Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs.Figure 4:Autooxidation rates of Hb A, α2(Cr)β2(Fe-O2), and α2(Fe-O2)β2(Cr). Absorbance change per 1 μM heme at 410 nm are plotted against time: Hb A (♦); α2(Cr)β2(Fe-O2), (○); and α2(Fe-O2)β2(Cr) (□). Conditions are as follows: protein concentration, 200 μM (on a metal basis); temperature, 37°C; buffer condition, 50 mM Tris with 100 mM chloride, pH 7.4, air equilibrated buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) K1 and K2 values (the equilibrium constants for the first and second oxygen molecule to bind to hybrid Hbs, respectively), P50 values (the oxygen pressure at half-saturation), nmax values (the maximal slopes of the Hill plots), and met-heme contents after measurements (the percent of the met-hemes in the total hemes) are listed in Table 1. The met-heme contents are markedly reduced by adding the enzymatic reduction system, but the oxygen equilibrium parameters are little affected by the same. We also found that the oxygen affinities of the hybrids are not significantly dependent on the protein concentrations in the range from 60 to 240 μM (on a metal basis) at pH 7.4, and in the range from 12 to 60 μM (on a metal basis) at pH 6.5. In the absence of IHP, Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs showed very high affinity for oxygen molecules. At pH 8.4, both hybrids bound oxygen noncooperatively (nmax = 1.0-1.1) with very high affinity comparable with that of isolated α or β chain, while they exhibited nmax values significantly higher than unity (nmax = 1.2-1.3) at pH 6.5. In both hybrids, Hill coefficients became larger as pH decreased. There were slight differences between the cooperativity of α2(Cr)β2(Fe) and that of α2(Fe)β2(Cr). The nmax values of α2(Cr)β2(Fe) (nmax = 1.1-1.2) were slightly smaller than those of α2(Fe)β2(Cr) (nmax = 1.1-1.3) at all pH values examined, and the latter hybrid exhibited a slightly larger Bohr effect than the former. The oxygen equilibrium properties of both hybrids were significantly affected by the addition of IHP. The oxygen affinities were reduced, and the cooperativity and the number of released Bohr protons was increased (Fig. 5). It is important to note that the extent of the IHP effect on the K2 values of both hybrids was very similar to those on the K4 value of native Hb A (43.Imai K. Yonetani T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) ( (3)K. Imai and K. Imaizumi, unpublished observations.) (see Fig. 5). These results suggest that Cr(III)PPIX behaves like a permanent oxy-heme. We succeeded in obtaining single crystals of deoxy- α2(Cr)β2(Fe) from solution of 2% protein, in the presence of 27-28% polyethylene glycol 1000 and 50 mM dithionite under anaerobic condition (Fig. 6). Crystals were examined by precession photography. The deoxy-α2(Cr)β2(Fe) crystals were found to be isomorphous to the native deoxy-Hb A crystals, which belong to space group P21212. The pH-dependent spectra of CrHb show well defined isosbestic points (Fig. 2A), indicating that CrHb exists in a pH-dependent equilibrium between two alternate states. Since Cr(III) complexes are almost universally hexacoodinated(44.Earley J.E. Cannon R.D. Transition Metal Chem. 1965; 1: 34-109Google Scholar), and Cr(III)PPIX prefers counter anion due to an extra positive charge, it is reasonable to consider that the proximal histidine coordinates to the Cr(III) ion and that the remaining coordination position is occupied by a water molecule or a hydroxyl ion, as in the case of aquomet-Hb. Thus, observed pH-dependent spectral changes may result from a coordination equilibrium between H2O and OH― in CrHb. Previously, Fiechtner reported that hemichrome structure is formed in CrHb(45.Fiechtner M.D. McLendon G. Bailey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); however, their published absorption spectrum is quite different from ours. Their ODSoret/OD280 ratio is 1.3, whereas ours is 3.6 at pH 7.4. The dimer-tetramer association equilibrium constants of α2(Cr)β2(Fe-CO) and α2(Fe-CO)β2(Cr), which were obtained by gel-filtration experiments, are about 5 × 105xsM–1 and 1 × 106 M–1, respectively. ( (4)K. Kajitani and H. Morimoto, unpublished observations.) Although part of the Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrids dissociated into aβ dimers under our experimental conditions used for oxygen equilibrium experiments, the Hill plots of both Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrids exhibited little protein concentration dependence (Table 1). We calculated the protein concentration dependence of the Hill plots of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrids using estimates of dimerization from dimer-tetramer association equilibrium constants and the assumption that a hemoglobin dimer containing Cr(III)PPIX and Fe(II)PPIX exhibits high oxygen affinity, comparable with that of isolated chains. The calculations revealed that the Hill plots were only slightly influenced by dimerization in the concentration range of above 10 μM (on a metal basis). Because the experimental Hb concentrations which we measured oxygen equilibrium curves were 12, 60, and 240 μM (on a metal basis), the theoretical consideration was consistent with the experimental results. K2 values of both Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs agreed with K4 values of Hb A, including both pH and IHP dependence (Fig. 5). In recent years, both association and dissociation rate constants for the last step (α- and β-subunit, respectively) in oxygen binding to Hb A were determined kinetically, and the Adair constants (K4 for α subunit and K4 for β subunit, respectively) were calculated from these rate constants(46.Mathews A.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In Table 2, we compared the K2 values of the Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs with the kinetically determined K4 values of Hb A. The K2 values of the Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrids were comparable with the K4 values of Hb A. These findings indicate that the influence of Cr(III)PPIX on the oxygen equilibrium properties of the counterpart ferrous subunits is similar to that of oxyheme. Stereochemical theory of Hb allostery (50.Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the oxygen affinity of Hb is regulated by the equilibrium position of the central metal with respect to the porphyrin ring, so that the position of the proximal histidine relative to the hemeplane is a key determinant of oxygen affinity of Hb. In this regard, Cr(III)PPIX can be an adequate model for an oxyheme for several reasons. (i) The Cr(III) ion has an ionic radius of 0.62 Å(51.Buchler J.W. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsvier, Amsterdam1975: 191-195Google Scholar), which is almost equal to that of low spin Fe(II). (ii) The Cr(III) ion is also expected to lie in the mean porphyrin plane(52.Summerville D.A. Jones R.D. Hoffman B.M. Basolo F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). (iii) Cr(III) complexes are almost universally hexacoordinated(44.Earley J.E. Cannon R.D. Transition Metal Chem. 1965; 1: 34-109Google Scholar), and (iv) Cr(III) porphyrin binds ligands so tightly (52.Summerville D.A. Jones R.D. Hoffman B.M. Basolo F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that the Cr(III)-histidine bond is expected to be as short as Fe(II)-histidine bond in oxy-Hb. Thus, both the proximal and the distal environments of Cr(III)PPIX in Hb may be similar to those of oxy-heme.Tabled 1 Cyanomet valency hybrid Hbs have been widely used as models for understanding the nature of the intermediate species formed during the cooperative oxygenation process. There are several structural and functional reasons for using cyanide-bound ferric heme as an oxyheme model. (i) The crystal structure of cyanomet-Hb (10.Deatherage J.F. Loe R.S. Anderson C.M. Moffat K. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 687-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is closely similar to that of oxy-Hb A(53.Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). (ii) Like an oxyheme, cyanide-bound ferric heme is low spin, with the ferric ion firmly anchored in the heme plane (4.Hoard J.L. Science. 1971; 174: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 12.Scheidt W.R. Reed C.A. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 543-555Crossref Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 54.Scheidt W.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1977; 10: 339-345Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). (iii) Cyanomet subunits in cyanomet valency hybrids give NMR spectra that are very similar to those observed in cyanomet Hb in the absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or IHP(5.Ogawa S. Shulman R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7.Ogawa S. Shulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 315-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). (iv) The ferrous subunits of cyanomet valency hybrids show fast ligand binding kinetics (3.Cassoly R. Gibson Q.H. Ogawa S. Shulman R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6.Cassoly R. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7332-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and high affinity for oxygen(8.Maeda T. Imai K. Tyuma I. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11.Nagai K. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, cyanomet valency hybrid Hbs are generally assumed to be a good model for the oxygenated intermediates(13.Szabo A. Karplus M.

Benazzi L. Ripamonti M. Rossi-Bernardi L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10358-10366Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because the K2 value of both α2(Fe3+CN―)β2(Fe2+) and α2(Fe2+)β2(Fe3+CN―) agreed well with the K4 value of Hb A including pH effect (11.Nagai K. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), ( (5)S. Iwata and H. Morimoto, unpublished observations.) cyanide-bound ferric heme is a good model for an oxygenated heme as Cr(III)PPIX. Actually, the oxygen equilibrium properties of both Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs almost agreed with those of the corresponding cyanomet valency hybrid Hbs. Yet, it should be pointed out that cyanomet valency hybrid Hbs have at least one serious disadvantage. The ferrous subunits of cyanomet valency hybrid Hbs are unstable against autooxidation. The inevitable autoxidation of ferrous subunits in these cyanomet hybrids results in asymmetric oxygen equilibrium curves(11.Nagai K. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since the addition of the met-Hb reducing reagent or enzymatic reduction system reduces not only the oxidized heme but also the cyanomet heme, these standard techniques for native Hb are not applicable to the cyanomet hybrids. In contrast to cyanomet heme, Cr(III)PPIX in Hb is not reduced to Cr(II)PPIX with 50 mM sodium dithionite or with the enzymatic reduction system. This advantage allows us to measure more accurately and reasonably oxygen equilibrium curves of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrid Hbs in the presence of the enzymatic reduction system. Moreover, complete deoxygenation of Cr(III)-Fe(II) hybrids can be easily attained by the addition of sodium dithionite, so that we can safely carry out the experiments under anaerobic condition. For example, we actually succeeded in making the single crystals of deoxy-α2(Cr)β2(Fe) grow in a low salt solution with the presence of both polyethylene glycol and 50 mM dithionite and under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 6). We thank Dr. K. Imai and Dr. K. Imaizumi for offering unpublished oxygen equilibrium data of Hb A. We also thank Dr. S. Y. Park for help on crystallization of Hbs and Dr. J. S. Olson for helpful discussions and suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2132337259,"Purified cytochrome b-c1 complexes from beef heart mitochondria and Rhodobacter sphaeroides were reconstituted into potassium-loaded asolectin liposomes for studies of the energy-dependent electron transfer reactions within the complexes. Both complexes in a ubiquinone-sufficient state exhibit antimycin-sensitive reduction of cytochromes b (both low and high potential ones) upon induction of a diffusion potential by valinomycin in the presence of ascorbate. Addition of N,N,N',N'-tet-ramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) to the ascorbate-reduced potassium-loaded asolectin proteoliposomes resulted in reduction of cytochrome b262. Upon addition of valinomycin, the induced diffusion potential caused a partial reoxidation of cytochrome b562 and partial reduction of cytochrome b566 in beef heart cytochrome b-c1 complex in the presence of antimycin and/or myxothiazol. Surprisingly, when ubiquinone-depleted beef heart cytochrome b-c1 complex liposomes were treated under the same conditions, no cytochrome b566 reduction was observed but only the oxidation of cytochrome b562, and the oxidation was not oxygen-dependent. We explain this effect by b566, iron-sulfur protein short-circuiting under these conditions, assuming that both antimycin and myxothiazol markedly affect subunit b conformation. The electrochemical midpoint potential of heme b566 appears to be significantly higher than that of heme b562 in the presence of myxothiazol, which cannot be accounted for only by the potential-driven electron transfer between these two hemes plus the shift in chemical midpoint potentials caused by myxothiazol. A model for energy coupling consistent with structural findings by Ohnishi et al. (Ohnishi, T., Schagger, H., Meinhardt, S. W., LoBrutto, R., Link, T. A., and von Jagow, G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 735-744) is presented. This model is a compromise between pure redox-loop and pure proton-pump mechanisms. Reoxidation of high potential heme b is observed in an antimycin- or antimycin plus myxothiazol-inhibited, ascorbate plus TMPD-prereduced R. sphaerodies b-c1 complex, upon membrane potential development, suggesting that a similar electron transfer mechanism is also operating in the bacterial complex."
https://openalex.org/W2151486936,"The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin II minifilaments is dependent both on Mg2+ concentration and on the state of phosphorylation of three serine sites at the C-terminal end of the heavy chains. Previous electric birefringence experiments on minifilaments showed a large dependence of signal amplitude on the phosphorylation state and Mg2+ concentration, consistent with large changes in filament flexibility. These observations suggested that minifilament stiffness was important for function. We now report that the binding of nucleotides to dephosphorylated minifilaments at Mg2+ concentrations needed for optimal activity increases the flexibility by about 10-fold, as inferred from the birefringence signal amplitude increase. An increase in flexibility with nucleotide binding is not observed for dephosphorylated minifilaments at lower Mg2+ concentrations or for phosphorylated minifilaments at any Mg2+ concentration examined. The relaxation times for minifilament rotations that are sensitive to the conformation myosin heads are also observed to depend on phosphorylation, Mg2+ concentration, and nucleotide binding. These latter experiments indicate that the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin II correlates with both changes in myosin head conformation and the ability of minifilaments to cycle between stiff and flexible conformations coupled to nucleotide binding and release.

These latter experiments indicate that the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin II correlates with both changes in myosin head conformation and the ability of minifilaments to cycle between stiff and flexible conformations coupled to nucleotide binding and release. The heavy chain component of the multiple members of the myosin superfamily share a highly homologous head (but with sufficient sequence differences to allow their classification into 10 or 11 families) connected to highly variable tails(1.Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The ATP- and actin-binding sites, actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity, and in vitro motility activity all reside in the conserved head domain. The tail is generally thought to determine the supramolecular organization of the myosins and their associations with specific cell structures and organelles. For example, the two N-terminal heads of type II myosin heavy chains are attached to a long rodlike C-terminal tail that self-associates into an α-helical coiled-coil and subsequently assemble into a bipolar filament (the heavy chains of other myosin classes either remain monomeric or form dimers but do not form filaments). The heavy chains of most class II myosins can be proteolytically cleaved to light meromyosin (LMM), ( (1)The abbreviations used are: LMMlight meromyosinELCessential light chainHMMheavy meromyosinS1subfragment 1S2subfragment 2AMPPNP5′-adenylyl-imidodiphosphateDTTdithiothreitolRLCregulatory light chain.) the C-terminal end of the α-helical, coiled-coil rod, and heavy meromyosin (HMM), the N-terminal portion of the α-helical, coiled-coil rod with its two attached globular heads(2.Sellers, J. R., Goodson, H. V. (1995) Protein Profile (Sheterline, P., ed) Vol. 2, 1323-1423Google Scholar). LMM retains the filament-forming properties of native myosin II, and HMM retains all of the catalytic activity and in vitro motility activity. HMM can be further proteolyzed to two monomers of subfragment 1 (S1), a single globular head with an α-helical C-terminal tail, and subfragment 2 (S2), the α-helical, coiled-coil portion of HMM. The individual S1 fragments retain most of the properties of HMM. light meromyosin essential light chain heavy meromyosin subfragment 1 subfragment 2 5′-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate dithiothreitol regulatory light chain. Class II myosins contain two pairs of light chains, essential light chains (ELC) and regulatory light chains (RLC), with one of each pair attached to the helical tail of each S1 domain(3.Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Some (molluscan) native type II myosins are activated by direct binding of Ca2+ to the ELC and others (smooth muscle, vertebrate nonmuscle, and Dictyostelium) by phosphorylation of the RLC (4.Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The light chains stabilize the helical tail of S1(3.Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 5.Eden D. Highsmith S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 372-373Google Scholar), and removal of the light chains or the helical tail of S1 greatly reduces the ability of S1 to move actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay(6.Waller G.S. Ouyang G. Swafford J. Vibert P. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15348-15352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but neither the light chains nor the helical tail of S1 are necessary for maximal actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of S1. These data are consistent with the most recent structural model of the contractile cycle derived from x-ray crystallography of S1; conformational changes in the globular portion of S1 resulting from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP are transmitted through the ELC and generate a rotational movement of the helical tail of S1(7.Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 19-28Google Scholar). This model was supported by recent experiments that demonstrate tilting of the light chain region of the myosin head during muscle contraction(8.Irving M. Allen T.S.C. Sabido-David C. Cralk J.S. Brandmeier B. Kendrick-Jones J. Corrie J.E.T. Trentham D.R. Goldman Y.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 688-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It seems likely, however, that the head and tail domains of class II myosins are not as functionally independent as the foregoing brief summary might imply. For example, the myosin superfamily can be grouped into essentially the same classes based on the overall structure of their tails(1.Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), suggesting co-evolution of the head and tail domains that would presumably result from their functional interactions. Moreover, the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of S1 from both ELC-regulated and RLC-regulated muscle myosins are unregulated (whereas HMM is regulated), suggesting that at least a portion of the tails is necessary for the appropriate coupling of S1 head and light chain conformations(4.Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Acanthamoeba myosin II provides a striking example of the functional interaction of the head and tail regions of a myosin II; both the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity and the in vitro motility activity of minifilaments of Acanthamoeba myosin II are inactivated by phosphorylation of 3 serine residues in a short (29 amino acids), nonhelical tail piece at the C-terminal tip of the α-helical, coiled-coil rod(9.Côté G.P. Collins J.H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12811-12816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Collins J.H. Côté G.P. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9993-9998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that the activity of each molecule in the filament depends not on its own phosphorylation state but on the level of phosphorylation of the filament as a whole. This led to the hypothesis that the state of phosphorylation at the tip of the tail affects the conformation of the hinge region at the HMM-LMM junction in the tails of adjacent molecules in the minifilament and, thereby, the interactions with F-actin of the S1 heads at the ends of the HMM arms. Electric birefringence studies on chymotrysin-treated Acanthamoeba myosin II parallel dimers (14.Wijmenga S.S. Atkinson M.A.L. Rau D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15803-15808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indeed indicated that the tip of the tail of one monomer was in close proximity to the hinge region of the other. Further electric birefringence experiments showed that the signals from minifilaments are fundamentally different from the monomer and parallel dimer signals; they were interpreted as being due to a coupling of internal motions, bending or flexing, and alignment in an electric field(15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies indicated that the stiffness of Acanthamoeba myosin II minifilaments is correlated with their actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. Filaments of dephosphorylated myosin II stiffen dramatically between 1 and 4 mM Mg2+. The optimal concentration for both catalytic and in vitro motility activities for dephosphorylated minifilaments occurs at about 4-5 mM Mg2+. In contrast, filaments of phosphorylated myosin, which are inactive at all Mg2+ concentrations, remain flexible even at 4 mM Mg2+. Recent experiments (16.Redowicz M.J. Martin B. Zolkiewski M. Ginsburg A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13558-13563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that binding of ATP to Acanthamoeba myosin II enhances the rate of papain cleavage of the heavy chain of monomers in the region corresponding to that which interacts with the ELC in chicken myosin II (3.Rayment I.

J. 1995; 68: 19-28Google Scholar) that ATP induces conformational changes in S1. However, ATP also promotes papain cleavage within the C-terminal tail of phosphorylated minifilaments(16.Redowicz M.J. Martin B. Zolkiewski M. Ginsburg A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13558-13563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this was not anticipated. We now investigate the effects of nucleotides on the flexibility of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated minifilaments. The electric birefringence signal amplitude of dephosphorylated minifilaments indicates that an order of magnitude increase in flexibility accompanies nucleotide binding at 4-5 mM Mg2+ but not at lower Mg2+ concentrations. Phosphorylated minifilaments remain flexible at all Mg2+ concentrations between 1 and 5 mM in the presence of nucleotide. In addition, over the same range of experimental conditions, differences in either the structure or orientation of S1 heads can be inferred from differences in relaxation times of the spinning rotational motions. These results demonstrate that a complex interplay among C-terminal phosphorylation state, Mg2+ concentration, and nucleotide binding determines minifilament flexibility and conformation and, ultimately, regulates enzymatic activity. Acanthamoeba myosin II was isolated (17.Collins J.H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2586-2595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dephosphorylated by potato acid phosphatase as described(18.Collins J.H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8011-8014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One portion of the dephosphorylated myosin II was then phosphorylated with partially purified myosin II heavy chain kinase (19.Côté G.P. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12781-12787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin II were separated from phosphatase and kinase, respectively, by Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration (13.Ganguly C. Atkinson M.A.L. Attri A.K. Sathyamoorthy V. Bowers B. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9993-9998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dialyzed against 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% sucrose, concentrated against solid sucrose, and stored at 4°C. The extent of heavy chain phosphorylation was quantified as described by Ganguly et al.(13.Ganguly C. Atkinson M.A.L. Attri A.K. Sathyamoorthy V. Bowers B. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9993-9998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely, the incorporation was 3-5 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin II. Myosin preparations were also characterized by their actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities; only dephosphorylated myosin II that was maximally active at 4-5 mM MgCl2 and phosphorylated myosin II that had minimal activity at 10 mM MgCl2(20.Collins J.H. Kuznicki J. Bowers B. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6910-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were used for further studies. Myosin II stock solutions used in the electric birefringence experiments were extensively dialyzed against 2.5 mM imidazole (pH 7.0), 5 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 50% sucrose. Final protein concentrations were 1-2 mg/ml. Samples used in electric birefringence experiments were first adjusted to 1 mM KCl, 2 mM imidazole (pH 7.4), 1 mM DTT, and 5% sucrose. The MgCl2 was added in aliquots, with mixing, to obtain the final Mg2+ concentration. Although no difference in signal was observed for adding nucleotide before Mg2+, nucleotide was typically added last. Mg2+-ATPase activity was measured under the conditions used for the electric birefringence measurements. Briefly, dephosphorylated myosin II minifilaments were adjusted on ice to 1 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM imidazole (pH 7.4), 5% sucrose, and 10 μg/ml myosin, with and without 15 μM F-actin(21.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Activities were measured from 0.5 μM to 1 mM ATP in 4 mM MgCl2 by measuring the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP(22.Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The instrumentation used has been described elsewhere(14.Wijmenga S.S. Atkinson M.A.L. Rau D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15803-15808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 632.8 nm light from a He-Ne laser (Uniphase, model 105-1) passes through a high quality Glan polarizing prism, oriented at 45°C with respect to vertical. The orientation of myosin II minifilaments in an externally applied electric field is characterized by the angle of rotation, δ, of plane polarized light as it passes through the sample and a subsequent λ/4 retardation plate oriented with its slow axis perpendicular to the initial plane of polarization. The light then passes through a second analyzing Glan polarizing prism oriented slightly off perpendicular to the initial plane of polarization. The angle δ of rotation is determined from the change in light intensity detected by a high speed photodiode (EG& HAD 1100A). To an excellent approximation, δ=α△IIα(Eq. 1) where α is the angle between polarizers relative to the crossed orientation (typically 1°C), Iα is the output voltage from the photodiode and amplifier at the angle α (typically 1000 mV), and ΔI is the change in output voltage due to the birefringence of the oriented sample. The relaxation times of the two birefringence components were extracted from the decay data by several methods. First, the relaxation time of the slow, negative birefringence component was determined directly from the slope of the semilog plot of signal intensity versus time at long times (>150 μs after the end of the pulse) as illustrated in Fig. 5. The relaxation time of the fast, positive birefringence component was then determined from the slopes of semilog plots of signal versus time after subtracting the contribution of the slow component, as shown in Fig. 6. The entire decay curve was also fit to a double exponential function, and best fitting values for τslow and τfast were determined simultaneously. Finally, the birefringence decay was also analyzed using the Fortran program Contin(23.Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-227Crossref Scopus (2620) Google Scholar, 24.Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), which gives a spectrum of relaxation times from an inverse Laplace transform of the data. The average relaxation times determined by the three methods did not differ significantly. The slowly decaying component can be well fit by a single exponential. We are less certain that the positive birefringence component has only a single relaxation time. We report fast decay times as average values, <τfast>, to emphasize this point.Figure 6:Effects of Mg2+ and nucleotide on the decay kinetics of the fast, positive birefringence component for dephosphorylated minifilaments. Semilog plots for the birefringence decay of the fast component signal are shown for 3 mM Mg2+ and for 4.5 mM Mg2+ with 5 μM ADP to illustrate the large changes in relaxation time that accompany nucleotide binding. The total signal amplitudes are closely similar for the two conditions shown. The contribution of the slow, negative birefringence component was removed by subtracting the single exponential determined from the best linear fits to the long time data as shown in Fig. 5. The dashed lines are the best linear fits to the data. Other solution conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As previously noted, a major experimental limitation was a field-induced, time-dependent aggregation of minifilaments that occurred at Mg2+ concentrations above about 4-5 mM. High protein concentrations, extended signal averaging, long field pulses, or high field strengths led first to a slowly decaying tail in the birefringence signal and eventually to visibly clouded solutions. This aggregation was less of a problem at pH 7.4 used in these experiments than at pH 7.0, which we used previously (15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in signal amplitude for dephosphorylated minifilaments, however, requires higher Mg2+ concentrations at pH 7.4 than at 7.0. The previously reported signal amplitudes at 4 mM Mg2+ at pH 7.0 require 4.5-5 mM at pH 7.4, depending on the specific myosin preparation. To avoid aggregation but also to achieve maximal signal amplitude and signal to noise ratio standard conditions for the experiments reported here were a protein concentration of about 40 μg/ml, a field strength E ~1.2 kV/cm, and a voltage pulse length of 140 μs. Optical signals from a single sample were averaged over 32 pulses. Occasionally, much longer pulse lengths (~800 μs) were used to ensure that more slowly relaxing birefringence components were not present. Signal amplitudes were also measured as a function of field strength, E, up to about 2 kV/cm to verify that δ scales with Eδ. Signal amplitudes were also observed to vary linearly with protein concentration up to about 100 μg/ml. Fig. 1 illustrates the general features of the electric birefringence signal of Acanthamoeba myosin II minifilaments reported previously(15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall signal is composed of at least two major components that are evident in the kinetics of both the signal rise when the electric field is applied (+E) and the decay after the field is removed (-E): (i) a comparatively small signal with positive birefringence that appears immediately after the field is applied and decays rapidly when the field is removed, and (ii) a much larger signal with negative birefringence that relaxes with much slower kinetics. Each component can be characterized by an amplitude, A, and relaxation time, τ. Compared with this complicated set of signals from minifilaments, the electric birefringence signals from Acanthamoeba myosin II monomers and parallel dimers (14.Wijmenga S.S. Atkinson M.A.L. Rau D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15803-15808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are straightforward and provide a basis for understanding the minifilament signals. A large permanent dipole from the distribution of charged amino acids (25.Hammer III, J.A. Bowers B. Paterson B.M. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) extends over the HMM region of Acanthamoeba myosin II. The alignment of this permanent dipole in an electric field results in positive birefringence signals for monomers and parallel dimers, indicating that molecules are orienting with their long axes parallel to the field. Qualitatively similar positive birefringence signals are seen for skeletal muscle myosin HMM and S1 heads(26.Highsmith S. Eden D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4917-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27.Highsmith S. Eden D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2237-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unperturbed minifilaments, however, have no net dipole moment due to the symmetry of the structure. A dipole moment can still be induced if the HMM arms can bend or flex in the direction of the applied field(28.Rau D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4622-4624Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). An internal flexibility of synthetic muscle myosin filaments was observed previously using spectroscopically labeled S1 heads(29.Eads T.M. Thomas D.D. Austin R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 55-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30.Kinosita K. Ishiwata S. Yoshimura H. Asai H. Ikegami A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5963-5975Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31.Ludescher R.D. Eads T.M. Thomas D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The dipole moment resulting from the bending or flexing motions of the HMM can couple through the applied field to the two fundamental rotational modes of the minifilament illustrated in Fig. 1: (i) the spinning rotation about the long axis and (ii) the end-over-end tumbling of the long axis, which correspond to the fast and slow relaxation kinetics of the positive and negative birefringence components, respectively. For average orientations of the HMM arms that are predominately parallel to the minifilament long axis and for small bending perturbations (low field strengths), the electric field induced dipole moment is predicted to be perpendicular to the long axis. The negative birefringence of the slowly relaxing component results from this unusual perpendicular orientation of the dipole and optical axes. The relaxation time of this component, τslow, is dependent on the distribution of mass along the minifilament axis. In practice, it is most sensitive to the number of monomers in the minifilament and the spacings between them. The positive birefringence signal is due to a component of the optical anisotropy that is perpendicular to the long axis (parallel to the dipole axis). We previously estimated, for example, that a 20° angle between the HMM axis and the minifilament axis is sufficient to account for the observed ratio of component amplitudes, Afast/Aslow. The S2 rods of HMM are expected to contribute more substantially to the optical signal than the globular S1 heads(26.Highsmith S. Eden D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4917-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The decay time of the spinning rotation that relaxes this positive birefringence component, <τfast>, depends on the distribution of all mass perpendicular to the long axis. The magnitude of the total birefringence signal is a measure of the bending force constant or the stiffness resisting internal HMM motions. Additionally, because the internal motions that create the net dipole moment couple with the rotations of the minifilament only in the rise part of the birefringence curve the ratio -ΔArise/ΔAdecay (see Fig. 1) is also expected to vary with the kinetics of the bending or flexing and thus is also connected to the stiffness. Fig. 2 shows the effect of ATP on signal amplitudes in 5 mM Mg2+. As found previously(15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amplitudes of both the positive and negative birefringence signal components of dephosphorylated myosin II minifilaments in the absence of nucleotide are much smaller in 5 mM Mg2+ than in 2 mM Mg2+ (compare the upper curve in Fig. 2 to Fig. 1). The addition of ATP to dephosphorylated minifilaments in 5 mM Mg2+ increased the signal amplitude to a magnitude similar to that observed at the lower concentration of Mg2+ in the absence of nucleotide (compare the lower curve in Fig. 2 with Fig. 1). The direction and magnitude of the effect of ATP on signal amplitude varied with the Mg2+ concentration and with myosin phosphorylation, as shown in Fig. 3. At 1 and 2 mM Mg2+, the total signal amplitude of dephosphorylated minifilaments decreased somewhat with added ATP (filled symbols), whereas above about 3 mM Mg2+, ATP increased the total signal amplitude. This reversal in the effect of ATP reflects the 20-25-fold decrease in signal amplitude between 1 and 5 mM Mg2+ in the absence of ATP but comparatively constant amplitude in its presence. In contrast, the birefringence signal amplitude of phosphorylated minifilaments was not affected either by the Mg2+ concentration, as observed previously(15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by the presence of ATP (Fig. 3, open symbols). The nucleotide concentration dependence of the amplitude of the birefringence signal for dephosphorylated myosin II minifilaments at 4.5 mM Mg2+ is shown in Fig. 4 for ATP, ADP, and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP. The protein concentration in these experiments was ~0.1 μM in myosin II monomers or ~0.2 μM in S1 heads. The lowest concentration of AMPPNP used, 0.4 μM, was sufficient to achieve essentially the maximal increase in signal amplitude (Fig. 4, squares). Even when the protein concentration was increased to ~0.35 μM S1, an AMPPNP concentration of 0.4 μM was still sufficient to obtain the maximal effect, i.e., even when the concentration of heads and AMPPNP were approximately equal (data not shown). Similarly, the addition of an approximately equimolar concentration of AMPPNP was sufficient to obtain the maximum decrease in the amplitude of the birefringence signal at 2 mM Mg2+ (data not shown). These data indicate that the Kd for AMPPNP binding is smaller than 0.2-0.4 μM, which is consistent with the Kd of ~0.09 μM that was estimated by differential scanning calorimetry. ( (2)M. Zolkiewski, M. J. Redowicz, E. D. Korn, and A. Ginsburg, unpublished observation.) In contrast to the stoichiometric effect of AMPPNP, the increase in birefringence signal amplitude with added ATP or ADP was more consistent with a titration of binding sites between 0 and 4 μM nucleotide (Fig. 4). No further increase in signal amplitude was observed between 5 and 50 μM ADP or ATP (Fig. 4, inset). Consistent with this behavior, increasing the myosin concentration from ~0.2 to ~0.35 μM S1 significantly decreased the observed signal amplitude at 0.4 μM ADP and to a somewhat greater extent also at 0.4 μM ATP, but it had a much smaller effect at ADP and ATP concentrations higher than 1 μM (data not shown). From the birefringence data, the Kd for ADP is ~1-2 μM, a not unreasonable value because ADP would be expected to bind to myosin more weakly than AMPPNP. In contrast to expectations, however, ATP also appears to bind to the myosin II minifilaments more weakly than AMPPNP. But, because the actin-independent Mg2+-ATPase activity of dephosphorylated myosin II under the experimental conditions used for the electric birefringence measurements is ~5-10 × 10−3 s−1, most of the ATP (for initial concentrations up to ~4 μM) was likely hydrolyzed to ADP during the course of a typical 30-60-min experiment. Thus, the high Kd estimated for ATP binding might actually have been for ADP binding instead. The relaxation time of the negative birefringence component of dephosphorylated minifilaments was insensitive to the total signal amplitude both in the presence and the absence of nucleotide. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the signal decay for minifilaments in 3 and 4.5 mM Mg2+ without added nucleotide and in 4.5 mM Mg2+ with 5 μM AMPPNP. The average relaxation time, τslow, was 235 ± 15 μs, corrected to water viscosity at 20°C. The relaxation time of the slow component was also unchanged in 50 μM AMPPNP, 250 μM ATP, and 5 and 50 μM ADP (data not shown). Relaxation times of the negative birefringence component with and without added nucleotides at two Mg2+ concentrations are summarized in Table 1 for both dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin II minifilaments. In general, the slow relaxation time is insensitive to myosin phosphorylation, Mg2+ concentration, and nucleotide binding.Tabled 1 In contrast, the relaxation time of the fast, positive birefringence component was markedly dependent on both Mg2+ and nucleotide. Fig. 6 illustrates the ~3.5-fold difference in the average fast component relaxation times, <τfast>, for dephosphorylated minifilaments in 4.5 mM Mg2+ with 5 μM ADP (45 μs) and in 3 mM Mg2+ without added nucleotide (12 μs). This difference in relaxation times was observed even though the total signal amplitudes for these two experimental conditions were comparable. Average fast component relaxation times for other conditions of nucleotide and Mg2+ concentration are summarized in Table 1 for dephosphorylated and phosphorylated minifilaments. The increase in the fast relaxation time for dephosphorylated minifilaments depended on the nucleotide species bound, ranging from 40-45 μs with bound ADP to 25-30 μs with AMPPNP and 20-25 μs with ATP. In contrast, the average fast relaxation time for phosphorylated minifilaments actually decreased somewhat with added ATP from 12-13 to 8-9 μs. Table 1 summarizes the effect of added nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMPPNP) at two Mg2+ concentrations on several parameters extracted from the birefringence experiment for both dephosphorylated and phosphorylated minifilaments. In addition to the total signal amplitude, Atotal, and the relaxation times of the positive and negative birefringence components, <τfast> and τslow, already discussed, two other parameters are also given in Table 1. As noted previously(15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the difference in total signal amplitude between dephosphorylated and phosphorylated minifilaments at 4.5-5 mM Mg2+ was accompanied by a difference in ΔArise/ΔAdecay (cf. Fig. 1) and a small difference in Afast/Aslow. The nucleotide-dependent increase in Atotal for dephosphorylated myosin II at 4-5 mM Mg2+ was also coupled to a decrease in the ratio -ΔArise/ΔAdecay from about 0.4 to 0.2. In contrast, the small increase in the ratio of the positive to negative birefringence amplitudes, Afast/Aslow, of dephosphorylated minifilaments as the Mg2+ concentration was increased from 3 to 4.5 mM was not reversed by adding nucleotide. In fact, the binding of ADP slightly increased this ratio even further. As with the average fast relaxation time, Afast/Aslow is not tightly linked to signal amplitude and flexibility. We previously reported that the electric birefringence signal amplitude of dephosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosin II minifilaments decreases significantly as the Mg2+ is increased from 1 to 4 mM, i.e., to the concentration range necessary for optimal expression of actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. We now find that the total signal amplitude is also dependent on nucleotide binding at the higher Mg2+ concentrations. Upon the addition of low concentrations of ADP, ATP, or AMPPNP, Atotal increases about 10-fold at 4-5 mM Mg2+. This increase in signal amplitude is not simply due to an increase in the dipole moment that might accompany binding of a charged ligand because nucleotides cause a decrease in the signal amplitude for dephosphorylated minifilaments at Mg2+ concentrations between 1 and about 3 mM. Moreover, nucleotides have no effect on the signal amplitude of phosphorylated minifilaments at 1-5 mM Mg2+ concentration even though nucleotides bind as well to phosphorylated minifilaments as to dephosphorylated minifilaments. The absence of a significant change in the relaxation time of the slow component, τslow, upon the addition of nucleotides to dephosphorylated minifilaments further indicates that nucleotide binding does not cause a large change in the overall structure of the minifilament. The basic structure, the number of monomers, the repeat distance between monomers, and the length of the central bare zone, is not significantly different in the presence or the absence of nucleotide. In particular, there is no evidence for aggregation, consistent with analytical ultracentrifugation data(16.Redowicz M.J. Martin B. Zolkiewski M. Ginsburg A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13558-13563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the order of magnitude of increase in total signal amplitude with nucleotide binding at 4-5 mM Mg2+ most probably results from a substantial increase in the flexibility of minifilaments. The decrease of -ΔArise/ΔAdecay at 4-5 mM Mg2+ from 0.4 to 0.2 (Table 1) with added nucleotide is also consistent with an increase in flexibility (28.Rau D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4622-4624Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This ratio will depend on stiffness through the kinetics of the bending motion and a value of ~ 0.2 is characteristic of other conditions that give approximately the same signal amplitude. Because nucleotide binding can either increase or decrease the signal amplitude, depending on the Mg2+ concentration, the effects of nucleotides and Mg2+ are neither independent nor simply additive. Rather, both likely regulate the flexibility of either the same or tightly coupled sites. We previously suggested that the bending site was at the HMM-LMM junction rather than at the S1-S2 junction or an elastic flexing of the S2 rod itself based on the estimated bending kinetics extracted from -ΔArise/ΔAdecay. This has been confirmed by more recent experiments on Acanthamoeba myosin II rods and rods in which the bend at the HMM-LMM junction has been removed or modified by amino acid substitution. The results demonstrate that the S1 heads are not necessary to obtain full signal amplitude but that the “native” HMM-LMM bend is essential(32.Redowicz M.J. Rau D.C. Korn E.D. Hammer III, J.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 160Google Scholar). The electric birefringence signal of native Acanthamoeba myosin II minifilaments almost certainly arises from bending at the HMM-LMM junction. Preliminary data ( (3)D. C. Rau, M. J. Redowicz, E. D. Korn, and J. A. Hammer III, unpublished observation.) also show that nucleotides have no effect on the electric birefringence of the rods, as expected if nucleotides interact only with S1 heads. The bending force spring constant of monomers in the minifilament can be estimated (28.Rau D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4622-4624Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) from the magnitude of the electric birefringence signal, assuming that the bending is Gaussian and planar and occurs at the HMM-LMM junction and that the S1 heads make little contribution to the birefringence compared with the coiled-coil α-helices of the rest of the molecule. For a bending spring constant α in units of energy/radian2 and thermal energy kT, reduced spring constants, a2 (= α/2kT), for dephosphorylated minifilaments at 4-5 mM Mg2+ with and without bound nucleotide are estimated as ~15 and ~300, respectively. These values correspond to root mean square angular fluctuations, √<ϕ2>, of about 10 and 2°, respectively. In contrast to the relative insensitivity of τslow to Mg2+ concentration and nucleotide binding, the relaxation time of the fast, positive birefringence component show a substantial dependence on conditions (Table 1). Even under conditions that give similar signal amplitudes, the average fast component relaxation times depend significantly on myosin phosphorylation, Mg2+ concentration, and nucleotide species. The decay of the positive birefringence component is through the spinning rotation of the long axis (cf. Fig. 1) and therefore is sensitive to the distribution of mass perpendicular to the filament axis, in particular to the angle between S2 rods and the minifilament axis, the angle between S1 and S2, the angle between S1 heads, and S1 conformation. These structural parameters are not as yet well enough characterized to justify hydrodynamic calculations. Given the comparative insensitivity of Afast/Aslow to experimental conditions (Table 1), however, the changes in <τfast> likely reflect changes either in S1 conformation or in the orientation of S1 relative to the minifilament axis, rather than in S2. A change in isolated S1 head conformation with nucleotide binding has been observed previously(33.Wakabayashi K. Tokunaga M. Kohno I. Sugimoto Y. Hamanaka T. Takezawa Y. Wakabayashi T. Amemiya Y. Science. 1992; 258: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34.Highsmith S. Eden D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2455-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35.Ostap E.M. White H.D. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6712-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We had previously (15.Rau D.C. Ganguly C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4612-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that minifilament stiffness is directly related to enzymatic activity for three reasons: the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of dephosphorylated myosin II minifilaments is maximally expressed at 4-5 mM Mg2+ when the filaments show substantial stiffness; phosphorylation greatly inhibits the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity and simultaneously inhibits the stiffening of minifilaments at 4-5 mM Mg2+; and the nonlinear dependence of enzymatic activity of minifilament copolymers on the ratio of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated monomers parallels their change in stiffness. The present data require modification of this proposal. In the presence of 5 mM Mg2+ and 250 μM ATP, minifilaments of catalytically active, dephosphorylated myosin II are a factor of 10 more flexible than without bound ATP and only a factor of 2 stiffer than inactive, phosphorylated minifilaments. Thus, the present data suggest that enzymatic activity may correlate more closely with the ability of minifilaments to cycle between stiff and flexible conformations coupled to ATP binding, hydrolysis, and subsequent release. This transition between flexible and stiff conformations is consistent with the large difference in axial compressibility of muscle fibers under rigor and relaxed conditions(36.Brenner B. Yu L.C. J. Physiol. 1991; 441: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37.Xu S. Brenner B. Yu L.C. J. Physiol. 1993; 461: 283-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with recent proposals based on spectroscopic experiments (38.Roopnarine O. Thomas D.D. Biophys.

The substantial differences in <τfast> seen with nucleotide binding and myosin phosphorylation are perhaps even more closely linked to enzymatic activity, given the dependence on nucleotide species, i.e., actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity may also correlate with nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in S1 or at the S1-S2 junction. Because there is no direct correlation between <τfast> and Atotal, the postulated nucleotide-dependent changes in S1 structure (and enzymatic activity) are not simply or directly coupled to changes in filament flexibility. The nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in S1 inferred from the electric birefringence are entirely consistent with the current model for the cross-bridge cycle but nucleotide-dependent changes in the conformation of the HMM-LMM junction introduce a novel concept that is likely not to be specific to Acanthamoeba myosin II. The coupling of the three experimental observables, Atotal, <τfast>, and actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity with heavy chain phosphorylation, nucleotide binding, and Mg2+ concentration indicates an important role for minifilament flexibility and conformational change in myosin activity. The mechanism for coupling these actions, however, is still obscure. All three are regulated by events at opposite ends of the myosin molecule: phosphorylation at the C-terminal tail and nucleotide binding to the S1 head. It is not clear where Mg2+ is acting. Changes in proteolytic susceptibility have also shown that the conformation of the S1 head is coupled to C-terminal phosphorylation (40.Ganguly C. Martin B. Bubb M. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20905-20908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the conformation of the C-terminal tail is coupled with nucleotide binding to the S1 head(16.Redowicz M.J. Martin B. Zolkiewski M. Ginsburg A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13558-13563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other than that both demonstrate that the opposite ends of the myosin II molecule are linked; however, there is no firm basis for comparing the conformational changes detected by limited proteolysis and those detected by electric birefringence."
