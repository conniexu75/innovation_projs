https://openalex.org/W2022256605,"Although n-type titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a promising substrate for photogeneration of hydrogen from water, most attempts at doping this material so that it absorbs light in the visible region of the solar spectrum have met with limited success. We synthesized a chemically modified n-type TiO2 by controlled combustion of Ti metal in a natural gas flame. This material, in which carbon substitutes for some of the lattice oxygen atoms, absorbs light at wavelengths below 535 nanometers and has a lower band-gap energy than rutile (2.32 versus 3.00 electron volts). At an applied potential of 0.3 volt, chemically modified n-type TiO2 performs water splitting with a total conversion efficiency of 11% and a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 8.35% when illuminated at 40 milliwatts per square centimeter. The latter value compares favorably with a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 1% for n-type TiO2 biased at 0.6 volt."

We demonstrate improved cooling values relative to the conventional bulk (Bi,Sb)2(Se,Te)3 thermoelectric materials using a n-type film in a one-leg thermoelectric device test setup, which cooled the cold junction 43.7 K below the room temperature hot junction temperature of 299.7 K. The typical device consists of a substrate-free, bulk-like (typically 0.1 millimeter in thickness, 10 millimeters in width, and 5 millimeters in length) slab of nanostructured PbSeTe/PbTe as the n-type leg and a metal wire as the p-type leg."

https://openalex.org/W2018680235,"In recent decades, there has been a tendency toward increased summer floods in south China, increased drought in north China, and moderate cooling in China and India while most of the world has been warming. We used a global climate model to investigate possible aerosol contributions to these trends. We found precipitation and temperature changes in the model that were comparable to those observed if the aerosols included a large proportion of absorbing black carbon (“soot”), similar to observed amounts. Absorbing aerosols heat the air, alter regional atmospheric stability and vertical motions, and affect the large-scale circulation and hydrologic cycle with significant regional climate effects."

A 33-mer peptide was identified that has several characteristics suggesting it is the primary initiator of the inflammatory response to gluten in Celiac Sprue patients. In vitro and in vivo studies in rats and humans demonstrated that it is stable toward breakdown by all gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal brush-border membrane proteases. The peptide reacted with tissue transglutaminase, the major autoantigen in Celiac Sprue, with substantially greater selectivity than known natural substrates of this extracellular enzyme. It was a potent inducer of gut-derived human T cell lines from 14 of 14 Celiac Sprue patients. Homologs of this peptide were found in all food grains that are toxic to Celiac Sprue patients but are absent from all nontoxic food grains. The peptide could be detoxified in in vitro and in vivo assays by exposure to a bacterial prolyl endopeptidase, suggesting a strategy for oral peptidase supplement therapy for Celiac Sprue."

https://openalex.org/W2105581244,"Molecular genetic studies of Drosophila melanogaster have led to profound advances in understanding the regulation of development. Here we report gene expression patterns for nearly one-third of all Drosophila genes during a complete time course of development. Mutations that eliminate eye or germline tissue were used to further analyze tissue-specific gene expression programs. These studies define major characteristics of the transcriptional programs that underlie the life cycle, compare development in males and females, and show that large-scale gene expression data collected from whole animals can be used to identify genes expressed in particular tissues and organs or genes involved in specific biological and biochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2129734399,"High-pressure Raman, infrared, x-ray, and neutron studies show that H 2 and H 2 O mixtures crystallize into the sII clathrate structure with an approximate H 2 /H 2 O molar ratio of 1:2. The clathrate cages are multiply occupied, with a cluster of two H 2 molecules in the small cage and four in the large cage. Substantial softening and splitting of hydrogen vibrons indicate increased intermolecular interactions. The quenched clathrate is stable up to 145 kelvin at ambient pressure. Retention of hydrogen at such high temperatures could help its condensation in planetary nebulae and may play a key role in the evolution of icy bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2097255766,"Insecticide resistance is one of the most widespread genetic changes caused by human activity, but we still understand little about the origins and spread of resistant alleles in global populations of insects. Here, via microarray analysis of all P450s in Drosophila melanogaster , we show that DDT-R , a gene conferring resistance to DDT, is associated with overtranscription of a single cytochrome P450 gene, Cyp6g1 . Transgenic analysis of Cyp6g1 shows that overtranscription of this gene alone is both necessary and sufficient for resistance. Resistance and up-regulation in Drosophila populations are associated with a single Cyp6g1 allele that has spread globally. This allele is characterized by the insertion of an Accord transposable element into the 5′ end of the Cyp6g1 gene."

https://openalex.org/W2089244519,"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is controlled by aspartate-specific cysteine proteases called caspases. In the immune system, apoptosis counters the proliferation of lymphocytes to achieve a homeostatic balance, which allows potent responses to pathogens but avoids autoimmunity. The CD95 (Fas, Apo-1) receptor triggers lymphocyte apoptosis by recruiting Fas-associated death domain (FADD), caspase-8 and caspase-10 proteins into a death-inducing signalling complex. Heterozygous mutations in CD95, CD95 ligand or caspase-10 underlie most cases of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a human disorder that is characterized by defective lymphocyte apoptosis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and autoimmunity. Mutations in caspase-8 have not been described in ALPS, and homozygous caspase-8 deficiency causes embryonic lethality in mice. Here we describe a human kindred with an inherited genetic deficiency of caspase-8. Homozygous individuals manifest defective lymphocyte apoptosis and homeostasis but, unlike individuals affected with ALPS, also have defects in their activation of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which leads to immunodeficiency. Thus, caspase-8 deficiency in humans is compatible with normal development and shows that caspase-8 has a postnatal role in immune activation of naive lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2133033884,"Theories of vision posit that form and motion are represented by neural mechanisms segregated into functionally and anatomically distinct pathways. Using point-light animations of biological motion, we examine the extent to which form and motion pathways are mutually involved in perceiving figures depicted by the spatio-temporal integration of local motion components. Previous work discloses that viewing biological motion selectively activates a region on the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STSp). Here we report that the occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA and FFA) also contain neural signals capable of differentiating biological from nonbiological motion. EBA and LOC, although involved in perception of human form, do not contain neural signals selective for biological motion. Our results suggest that a network of distributed neural areas in the form and motion pathways underlie the perception of biological motion."

https://openalex.org/W2089844705,"The spindle checkpoint delays sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes have undergone bipolar spindle attachment. Checkpoint failure may result in chromosome mis-segregation and may contribute to tumorigenesis. We showed that the human protein Hec1 was required for the recruitment of Mps1 kinase and Mad1/Mad2 complexes to kinetochores. Depletion of Hec1 impaired chromosome congression and caused persistent activation of the spindle checkpoint, indicating that high steady-state levels of Mad1/Mad2 complexes at kinetochores were not essential for checkpoint signaling. Simultaneous depletion of Hec1 and Mad2 caused catastrophic mitotic exit, making Hec1 an attractive target for the selective elimination of spindle checkpoint-deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W2144475886,"Death pathways restricted to specific neuronal classes could potentially allow for precise control of developmental neuronal death and also underlie the selectivity of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease. We show that Fas-triggered death of normal embryonic motoneurons requires transcriptional upregulation of neuronal NOS and involves Daxx, ASK1, and p38 together with the classical FADD/caspase-8 cascade. No evidence for involvement of this pathway was found in cells other than motoneurons. Motoneurons from transgenic mice overexpressing ALS-linked SOD1 mutants (G37R, G85R, or G93A) displayed increased susceptibility to activation of this pathway: they were more sensitive to Fas- or NO-triggered cell death but not to trophic deprivation or excitotoxic stimulation. Thus, triggering of a motoneuron-restricted cell death pathway by neighboring cells might contribute to motoneuron loss in ALS."

https://openalex.org/W2152832320,"We used fMRI to study the distribution of object category information in the ventral visual pathway. Extending the findings of Haxby et al. 2001Haxby J.V. Gobbini M.I. Furey M.L. Ishai A. Schouten J.L. Pietrini P. Distributed and overlapping representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex.Science. 2001; 293: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, we find that categories of stimuli can be distinguished by the pattern of activation they elicit across this entire pathway, even when the stimuli within a category differ in viewpoint, exemplar, or image format. However, regions within the ventral visual pathway are neither interchangeable nor equipotential. Although the FFA and PPA permit excellent discrimination between preferred versus nonpreferred stimuli (e.g., faces-bottles and houses-bottles, respectively), we find that neither region alone permits accurate discrimination between pairs of nonpreferred stimuli (e.g., bottles-shoes). These findings indicate that the ventral visual pathway is not homogeneous, but contains some regions (including FFA and PPA) that are primarily involved in the analysis of a single class of stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W2123248918,"Zonula occludens (ZO)-1 is a member of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs) family of membrane-associated signaling molecules that binds directly to both cytosolic and transmembrane components of the tight junction and is believed to organize these proteins within the apical junctional complex. It also binds directly to F-actin, although the functional relevance of this interaction is unknown. To address this issue, we have used VSVG-tagged transgenes to dissect ZO-1 and have identified a 220 amino acid region of ZO-1 that is necessary for its association with F-actin in MDCK cell pull-down assays. A GST fusion expressing this region can bind directly to F-actin in vitro, whereas a GFP fusion expressing this domain decorates actin stress fibers when expressed in MDCK cells. These results indicate that this actin-binding region (ABR) is both necessary and sufficient for binding to F-actin in vitro and in vivo. VSVG-tagged transgenes that lack the ABR still accumulate at both early and late cell-cell contacts in MDCK cells, suggesting that the ABR is not required for tight junction localization. However, accumulation of constructs lacking the ABR is markedly reduced at tight junctions in confluent cells, suggesting that the ABR does play an important role in the localization of ZO-1 at junctions. Furthermore, the ABR is required for localization to a novel actin-rich pool of ZO-1 that accumulates in puncta at the free edge of cells before initiation of cell-cell contact. We conclude that direct interactions between ZO-1 and F-actin play a role in several different steps of junction assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1974160934,"Unc104/KIF1A belongs to a class of monomeric kinesin motors that have been thought to possess an unusual motility mechanism. Unlike the unidirectional motion driven by the coordinated actions of the two heads in conventional kinesins, single-headed KIF1A was reported to undergo biased diffusional motion along microtubules. Here, we show that Unc104/KIF1A can dimerize and move unidirectionally and processively with rapid velocities characteristic of transport in living cells. These results suggest that Unc104/KIF1A operates in vivo by a mechanism similar to conventional kinesin and that regulation of motor dimerization may be used to control transport by this class of kinesins."
https://openalex.org/W2150730775,"Over 400 non-photosynthetic species from 10 families of vascular plants obtain their carbon from fungi and are thus defined as myco-heterotrophs. Many of these plants are epiparasitic on green plants from which they obtain carbon by 'cheating' shared mycorrhizal fungi. Epiparasitic plants examined to date depend on ectomycorrhizal fungi for carbon transfer and exhibit exceptional specificity for these fungi, but for most myco-heterotrophs neither the identity of the fungi nor the sources of their carbon are known. Because many myco-heterotrophs grow in forests dominated by plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; phylum Glomeromycota), we proposed that epiparasitism would occur also between plants linked by AMF. On a global scale AMF form the most widespread mycorrhizae, thus the ability of plants to cheat this symbiosis would be highly significant. We analysed mycorrhizae from three populations of Arachnitis uniflora (Corsiaceae, Monocotyledonae), five Voyria species and one Voyriella species (Gentianaceae, Dicotyledonae), and neighbouring green plants. Here we show that non-photosynthetic plants associate with AMF and can display the characteristic specificity of epiparasites. This suggests that AMF mediate significant inter-plant carbon transfer in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2078578513,"About 240,000 square kilometers of Earth's surface is disrupted by mining, which creates watersheds that are polluted by acidity, aluminum, and heavy metals. Mixing of acidic effluent from old mines and acidic soils into waters with a higher pH causes precipitation of amorphous aluminum oxyhydroxide flocs that move in streams as suspended solids and transport adsorbed contaminants. On the basis of samples from nine streams, we show that these flocs probably form from aggregation of the ɛ -Keggin polyoxocation AlO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12 7+ (aq) (Al 13 ), because all of the flocs contain distinct Al(O) 4 centers similar to that of the Al 13 nanocluster."

https://openalex.org/W1976571730,"BMPs have been proposed to pattern the medial-lateral axis of the telencephalon in a concentration-dependent manner, thus helping to subdivide the embryonic telencephalon into distinct forebrain regions. Using a CRE/loxP genetic approach, we tested this hypothesis by disrupting the Bmpr1a gene in the telencephalon. In mutants, BMP signaling was compromised throughout the dorsal telencephalon, but only the most dorsalmedial derivative, the choroid plexus, failed to be specified or differentiate. Choroid plexus precursors remained proliferative and did not adopt the fate of their lateral telencephalic neighbors. These results demonstrate that BMP signaling is required for the formation of the most dorsal telencephalic derivative, the choroid plexus, and that BMP signaling plays an essential role in locally patterning the dorsal midline. Our data fail to support a more global, concentration-dependent role in specifying telencephalic cell fates."

https://openalex.org/W2037736511,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are membrane spanning proteins with intrinsic kinase activity. Although these receptors are known to be involved in proliferation and differentiation of cells, their roles in regulating central synaptic transmission are largely unknown. In CA1 pyramidal neurons, activation of D2 class dopamine receptors depressed excitatory transmission mediated by the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor. This depression resulted from the quinpirole-induced release of intracellular Ca(2+) and enhanced Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors. The dopamine receptor-mediated depression was dependent on the ""transactivation"" of PDGFRbeta. Therefore, RTK transactivation provides a novel mechanism of communication between dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems and might help to explain how reciprocal changes in these systems could be linked to the deficits in cognition, memory, and attention observed in schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2054207274,"Sensory axons from dorsal root ganglia neurons are guided to spinal targets by molecules differentially expressed along the dorso-ventral axis of the neural tube. NT-3-responsive muscle afferents project ventrally, cease extending, and branch upon contact with motoneurons (MNs), their synaptic partners. We have identified WNT-3 as a candidate molecule that regulates this process. Wnt-3 is expressed by MNs of the lateral motor column at the time when MNs form synapses with sensory neurons. WNT-3 increases branching and growth cone size while inhibiting axonal extension in NT-3- but not NGF-responsive axons. Ventral spinal cord secretes factors with axonal remodeling activity for NT-3-responsive neurons. This activity is present at limb levels and is blocked by a WNT antagonist. We propose that WNT-3, expressed by MNs, acts as a retrograde signal that controls terminal arborization of muscle afferents."

https://openalex.org/W2112152571,"Perhaps synaptic vesicles can recycle so rapidly because they avoid complete exocytosis, and release transmitter through a fusion pore that opens transiently. This view emerges from imaging whole terminals where the fluorescent lipid FM1-43 seems unable to leave vesicles during transmitter release. Here we imaged single, FM1-43-stained synaptic vesicles by evanescent field fluorescence microscopy, and tracked the escape of dye from single vesicles by watching the increase in fluorescence after exocytosis. Dye left rapidly and completely during most or all exocytic events. We conclude that vesicles at this terminal allow lipid exchange soon after exocytosis, and lose their dye even if they connected with the plasma membrane only briefly. At the level of single vesicles, therefore, observations with FM1-43 provide no evidence that exocytosis of synaptic vesicles is incomplete."
https://openalex.org/W2141954642,"Endostatin and angiostatin are known as tumor-derived angiogenesis inhibitors, but their mechanisms of action are not yet completely defined. We report here that endostatin and angiostatin, delivered by adenoviral vectors, reduced in vitro the neovessel formation in the mouse aortic ring assay by 85 and 40%, respectively. We also demonstrated in vivo that both endostatin and angiostatin inhibited local invasion and tumor vascularization of transplanted murine malignant keratinocytes, and reduced by 50 and 90% the development of highly vascularized murine mammary tumors. This inhibition of tumor growth was associated with a reduction of tumor vascularization. Expression analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) carried out in the mouse aortic ring model revealed a 3- to 10-fold down-regulation of VEGF mRNA expression in endostatin-treated rings. A similar down-regulation of VEGF expression at both mRNA and protein levels was also observed in the two in vivo cancer models after treatment with each angiogenesis inhibitor. This suggests that endostatin and angiostatin effects may be mediated, at least in part, by their ability to down-regulate VEGF expression within the tumor. This work provides evidence that endostatin and angiostatin act on tumor cells themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1983547347,"The mammalian vomeronasal system is specialized in pheromone detection. The neural circuitry of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) provides an anatomical substrate for the coding of pheromone information. Here, we describe the axonal projection pattern of vomeronasal sensory neurons to the AOB and the dendritic connectivity pattern of second-order neurons. Genetically traced sensory neurons expressing a given gene of the V2R class of vomeronasal receptors project their axons to six to ten glomeruli distributed in globally conserved areas of the AOB, a theme similar to V1R-expressing neurons. Surprisingly, second-order neurons tend to project their dendrites to glomeruli innervated by axons of sensory neurons expressing the same V1R or the same V2R gene. Convergence of receptor type information in the olfactory bulb may represent a common design in olfactory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2039159702,"The site of modification of synaptic transmission during long-term plasticity in the mammalian hippocampus remains controversial. Here we used a fluorescent marker of presynaptic activity, FM 1-43, to directly image presynaptic function during metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) at CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses in acute hippocampal slices. We found a significant decrease in the rate of FM 1-43 release in response to synaptic stimulation following induction of mGluR-LTD, providing direct evidence for altered presynaptic function. Moreover, we found that mGluR-LTD causes several changes in FM dye release properties that are consistent with a change in the mode of vesicle cycling, possibly involving a switch from a full fusion mode of release to a ""kiss-and-run"" mode of release through the transient opening of a fusion pore."
https://openalex.org/W1525911149,"Induction of tumor cell migration is a key step in invasion and metastasis. Here we report that the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell migration of breast cancer cells is attributed to a transient, rather than a sustained, activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1 due to c-erbB-2 signaling. EGF stimulation of EGF receptor (EGFR) overexpressing cells resulted in long-term PLC-gamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation and sustained levels of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) producing sinusoidal calcium oscillations. In contrast, c-erbB-2/EGFR expressing cells displayed baseline transient calcium oscillations after EGF treatment due to short-term PLC-gamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation and short-term IP3 and DAG turnover. A third cell line expressing a point-mutated c-erbB-2 receptor that lacks the autophosphorylation Y1248 was generated to investigate whether the different PLC-gamma1 activation was attributed to this structure. Neither PLC-gamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation nor IP3 and DAG turnover and calcium oscillations were observed in this cell line, indicating the modulation of the PLC-g1 activation time course by c-erbB-2 signaling. Induction of cell migration was solely observable in the c-erbB-2-positive cell line as proved by the mode of actin reorganization and a cell migration assay, using a 3D-collagen lattice. In summary, c-erbB-2 up-regulation switches on the cell migration program by modulating the time course of PLC-gamma1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2100007794,"Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) plays a major role in tumor angiogenesis and raises the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). Carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), an inhibitor of calcium influx and of angiogenesis, is under investigation as a tumoristatic agent. We studied the effect of CAI and the role of [Ca2+]i in VEGF-A signaling in human endothelial cells. VEGF-A induced a biphasic [Ca2+]i signal. VEGF-A increased the level of intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which suggests that VEGF-A releases Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive stores and induces store-operated calcium influx. Reduction of either extracellular or intracellular free Ca2+ inhibited VEGF-A-induced proliferation. CAI inhibited IP3 formation, both phases of the calcium signal, nitric oxide (NO) release, and proliferation induced by VEGF-A. CAI prevented neither activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) (KDR/Flk-1), phospholipase C-g, or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) nor translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). We conclude that calcium signaling is necessary for VEGF-A-induced proliferation. MAP kinase activation occurs independently of [Ca2+]i but is not sufficient to induce proliferation in the absence of calcium signaling. Inhibition of the VEGF-A-induced [Ca2+]i signal and proliferation by CAI can be explained by inhibition of IP3 formation and may contribute to the antiangiogenic action of CAI. Calcium-dependent NO formation may represent a link between calcium signaling and proliferation."

Recording from neurons in magnocellular layers of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in macaque monkeys, we found that magnocellular neurons were unequivocally responsive to S cone-isolating stimuli. A quantitative analysis suggests that S cones provided about 10% of the input to these cells, on average, while L:M ratios were far more variable. S cone signals influenced responses with the same sign as L and M cone inputs (i.e., no color opponency). Magnocellular afferent recordings following inactivation of primary visual cortex demonstrated that S cone signals were feedforward in nature and did not arise from cortical feedback to LGN"

An experimental paradigm contrasted sentences requiring syntactic decisions with those requiring semantic decisions.

https://openalex.org/W2088543121,"Glomerular hypertension is a major determinant advancing progression to end-stage renal failure. Podocytes, which are thought to counteract pressure-mediated capillary expansion, are increasingly challenged in glomerular hypertension. Studies in animal models of glomerular hypertension indicate that glomerulosclerosis develops from adhesions of the glomerular tuft to Bowman's capsule due to progressive podocyte loss. However, the molecular alterations of podocytes in glomerular hypertension are unknown. In this study, we determined the changes in gene expression in podocytes induced by mechanical stress in vitro (cyclic biaxial stretch, 0.5 Hz, 5% linear strain, 3 days) using cDNA arrays (6144 clones). Sixteen differentially regulated genes were identified, suggesting alterations of cell-matrix interaction, mitochondrial/metabolic function, and protein synthesis/degradation in stretched podocytes. The transcript for the matricellular protein osteopontin (OPN) was most strongly up-regulated by stretch (approximately threefold). By reverse transcriptase-polymer chain reaction, up-regulation of OPN mRNA was also detected in glomeruli of rats treated for 2.5 wk with desoxycorticosterone acetate-salt, an animal model of glomerular hypertension. In cultured podocytes, OPN coating induced a motile phenotype increasing actin nucleation proteins at cell margins and reducing stress fibers and focal adhesions. Intriguingly, additional OPN coating of collagen IV-coated membranes accelerated stretch-induced actin reorganization and markedly diminished podocyte loss at higher strain. This study delineates the molecular response of podocytes to mechanical stress and identifies OPN as a stretch-adapting molecule in podocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1982526969,"Utilizing a multielectrode array to record spontaneous and visually evoked activity of cortical neurons in area 17, we investigate the relationship between long-range correlated spontaneous activity and functional ocular dominance columns during early ferret postnatal development (P24-P29). In regions of visual cortex containing alternating ocular dominance patches, periodic fluctuations in correlated activity are observed in which spontaneous activity is most highly correlated between cortical patches exhibiting the same eye preference. However, these fluctuations are present even within large contralateral eye-dominated bands which lack any periodic alternations in ocular dominance. Thus, the organization of ocular dominance columns cannot fully account for the patterns of correlated activity we observe. Our results suggest that patterns of long-range correlated activity reflect an intrinsic periodicity of cortical connectivity that is constrained by segregated eye-specific LGN afferents."
https://openalex.org/W2170154429,"One central problem in vision is how to compensate for retinal slip. A novel illusion (visual jitter) suggests the compensation mechanism is based solely on retinal motion. Adaptation to visual noise attenuates the motion signals used by the compensation stage, producing illusory jitter due to the undercompensation of retinal slip. Here, we investigated the neural substrate of retinal slip compensation during this illusion using high-field fMRI and retinotopic mapping in flattened cortical format. When jitter perception occurred, MR signal decreased in lower stages of the visual system but increased prominently in area MT+. In conclusion, visual areas as early as V1 are responsible for the adaptation stage, and MT+ is involved in the compensation stage. The present finding suggests the pathway from V1 to MT+ has an important role in stabilizing the visual world."
