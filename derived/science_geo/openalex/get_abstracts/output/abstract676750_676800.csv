https://openalex.org/W3175969873,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 highlights the need to develop universal vaccination strategies against the broader Sarbecovirus subgenus. Using chimeric spike designs, we demonstrate protection against challenge from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, bat CoV (Bt-CoV) RsSHC014, and a heterologous Bt-CoV WIV-1 in vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike messenger RNAs (mRNAs) induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against high-risk Sarbecoviruses. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a marked reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous Sarbecoviruses, but SARS-CoV and WIV-1 challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infections. Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized D614G, mink cluster five, and the UK B.1.1.7 and South African B.1.351 variants of concern. Thus, multiplexed-chimeric spikes can prevent SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections with pandemic potential."

This study aimed to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models based on invasive laboratory and noninvasive clinical and demographic data from patients’ day of admission. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were developed and compared using invasive, non-invasive, and both groups. The results suggested that non-invasive features could provide mortality predictions that are similar to the invasive and roughly on par with the joint model. Feature inspection results from SVM-RFE and sparsity analysis displayed that, compared with the invasive model, the non-invasive model can provide better performances with a fewer number of features, pointing to the presence of high predictive information contents in several non-invasive features, including SPO 2 , age, and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, while the invasive model was able to provide better mortality predictions for the imminent future, non-invasive features displayed better performance for more distant expiration intervals. Early mortality prediction using non-invasive models can give us insights as to where and with whom to intervene. Combined with novel technologies, such as wireless wearable devices, these models can create powerful frameworks for various medical assignments and patient triage."
https://openalex.org/W3175527099,"The most prevalent post-transcriptional mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), plays diverse RNA-regulatory roles, but its genetic control in human tissues remains uncharted. Here we report 129 transcriptome-wide m6A profiles, covering 91 individuals and 4 tissues (brain, lung, muscle and heart) from GTEx/eGTEx. We integrate these with interindividual genetic and expression variation, revealing 8,843 tissue-specific and 469 tissue-shared m6A quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which are modestly enriched in, but mostly orthogonal to, expression QTLs. We integrate m6A QTLs with disease genetics, identifying 184 GWAS-colocalized m6A QTL, including brain m6A QTLs underlying neuroticism, depression, schizophrenia and anxiety; lung m6A QTLs underlying expiratory flow and asthma; and muscle/heart m6A QTLs underlying coronary artery disease. Last, we predict novel m6A regulators that show preferential binding in m6A QTLs, protein interactions with known m6A regulators and expression correlation with the m6A levels of their targets. Our results provide important insights and resources for understanding both cis and trans regulation of epitranscriptomic modifications, their interindividual variation and their roles in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W3173485772,"Adenine base editors (ABEs) catalyze specific A-to-G conversions at genomic sites of interest. However, ABEs also induce cytosine deamination at the target site. To reduce the cytosine editing activity, we engineered a commonly used adenosine deaminase, TadA7.10, and found that ABE7.10 with a D108Q mutation in TadA7.10 exhibited tenfold reduced cytosine deamination activity. The D108Q mutation also reduces cytosine deamination activity in two recently developed high-activity versions of ABE, ABE8e and ABE8s, and is compatible with V106W, a mutation that reduces off-target RNA editing. ABE7.10 containing a P48R mutation displayed increased cytosine deamination activity and a substantially reduced adenine editing rate, yielding a TC-specific base editing tool for TC-to-TT or TC-to-TG conversions that broadens the utility of base editors."

Barcodes and unique molecular identifiers are synthesized using dimeric nucleotide building blocks that allow error detection. We illustrate the use of the method for evaluating barcode assignment accuracy, differential isoform usage in myeloma cell lines, and fusion transcript detection in a sarcoma cell line."
https://openalex.org/W3174213828,"SPTBN1 encodes βII-spectrin, the ubiquitously expressed β-spectrin that forms micrometer-scale networks associated with plasma membranes. Mice deficient in neuronal βII-spectrin have defects in cortical organization, developmental delay and behavioral deficiencies. These phenotypes, while less severe, are observed in haploinsufficient animals, suggesting that individuals carrying heterozygous SPTBN1 variants may also show measurable compromise of neural development and function. Here we identify heterozygous SPTBN1 variants in 29 individuals with developmental, language and motor delays; mild to severe intellectual disability; autistic features; seizures; behavioral and movement abnormalities; hypotonia; and variable dysmorphic facial features. We show that these SPTBN1 variants lead to effects that affect βII-spectrin stability, disrupt binding to key molecular partners, and disturb cytoskeleton organization and dynamics. Our studies define SPTBN1 variants as the genetic basis of a neurodevelopmental syndrome, expand the set of spectrinopathies affecting the brain and underscore the critical role of βII-spectrin in the central nervous system. SPTBN1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, language and motor delays, autism, seizures and other features. The variants disrupt βII-spectrin function and disturb cytoskeletal organization and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3176380003,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is causing high morbidity and mortality burden worldwide with unprecedented strain on health care systems. To investigate the time course of the antibody response in relation to the outcome we performed a study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As comparison we also investigated the time course of the antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic subjects. Study results show that patients produce a strong antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with high correlation between different viral antigens (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and among antibody classes (IgA, IgG, and IgM and neutralizing antibodies). The antibody peak is reached by 3 weeks from hospital admission followed by a sharp decrease. No difference was observed in any parameter of the antibody classes, including neutralizing antibodies, between subjects who recovered or with fatal outcome. Only few asymptomatic subjects developed antibodies at detectable levels."
https://openalex.org/W3173819558,"Central to tumor evolution is the generation of genetic diversity. However, the extent and patterns by which de novo karyotype alterations emerge and propagate within human tumors are not well understood, especially at single-cell resolution. Here, we present 3D Live-Seq-a protocol that integrates live-cell imaging of tumor organoid outgrowth and whole-genome sequencing of each imaged cell to reconstruct evolving tumor cell karyotypes across consecutive cell generations. Using patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids and fresh tumor biopsies, we demonstrate that karyotype alterations of varying complexity are prevalent and can arise within a few cell generations. Sub-chromosomal acentric fragments were prone to replication and collective missegregation across consecutive cell divisions. In contrast, gross genome-wide karyotype alterations were generated in a single erroneous cell division, providing support that aneuploid tumor genomes can evolve via punctuated evolution. Mapping the temporal dynamics and patterns of karyotype diversification in cancer enables reconstructions of evolutionary paths to malignant fitness."
https://openalex.org/W3173707338,"Academic resilience is a student's ability to achieve academic results significantly higher than would be expected according to their socioeconomic level. In this study, we aimed to identify the characteristics of students, families, and teacher activities which had the greatest impact on academic resilience. The sample comprised 117,539 fourth grade students and 6,222 teachers from 4,324 schools in member states of the European Union that participated in the PIRLS 2016 study. We specified a two-level hierarchical linear model in two phases: in the first level we used the students' personal and family background variables, in the second level we used the variables related to teaching activity. In the first phase we used the complete model for all countries and regions, in the second phase we produced a model for each country with the highest possible number of statistically significant variables. The results indicated that the students' personal and family variables that best predicted resilience were the reading self-confidence index, which increased the probability of student resilience by between 62 and 130 percentage points, a feeling of belonging to the school, which increased the chances of being resilient by up to 40 percentage points, and support from the family before starting primary school (Students from Lithuania who had done early literary activities in the family setting were twice as likely to be resilient than those who had not). The teaching-related factors best predicting resilience were keeping order in the classroom, a safe and orderly school environment (increasing chances of resilience by up to 62 percentage points), and teaching focused on comprehension and reflection, which could increase the probability of resilience by up to 61 percentage points."

https://openalex.org/W3173836419,"Background Although many studies have analyzed mental health problems in college students in China, the associations of mental health with individual and family circumstances, academic performance, and social support were rarely discussed. Objectives The study aimed to determine the mental health status and its associated factors among college students in China. Methods An online survey was conducted on 300 students selected through a cluster sampling strategy in a university in Hubei, China, tapping into sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, their mental health status measured by the modified Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), and social support measured by the Social Support Rating Scale. Multivariate linear regression models were established to identify predictors of the SCL-90 scores. Results Mental health disorders were found in 8% of the respondents, with obsessive compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity and depression as the top three reported problems. Compared with the national population norms of university students in 2014, our study participants had higher scores in SCL-90. There were statistically significant difference in the Global Severity index (GSI) and all nine subscales scores ( p &lt;0.05). Poorer self-rated health, higher study pressure, and lower social support were significant predictors of higher SCL-90 scores ( p &lt;0.05) after adjustment for variations in other variables. Conclusions College students in Hubei, China may experience a range of different mental health problems, which are associated with their individual, study, and social circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3177058037,"Nurse identification of patient deterioration is critical, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as patients can deteriorate quickly. While the literature has shown that nurses rely on intuition to make decisions, there is limited information on what sources of data experienced nurses utilize to inform their intuition. The objectives of this study were to identify sources of data that inform nurse decision-making related to recognition of deteriorating patients, and explore how COVID-19 has impacted nurse decision-making.In this qualitative study, experienced nurses voluntarily participated in focused interviews. During focused interviews, expert nurses were asked to share descriptions of memorable patient encounters, and questions were posed to facilitate reflections on thoughts and actions that hindered or helped their decision-making. They were also asked to consider the impact of COVID-19 on nursing and decision-making. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, study team members reviewed transcripts and coded responses, and organized key findings into themes.Several themes related to decision-making were identified by the research team, including: identifying patient care needs, workload management, and reflecting on missed care opportunities to inform learning. Participants (n = 10) also indicated that COVID-19 presented a number of unique barriers to nurse decision-making.Findings from this study indicate that experienced nurses utilize several sources of information to inform their intuition. It is apparent that the demands on nurses in response to pandemics are heightened. Decision-making themes drawn from participants' experiences can to assist nurse educators for training nursing students on decision-making for deteriorating patients and how to manage the potential barriers (e.g., resource constraints, lack of family) associated with caring for patients during these challenging times prior to encountering these issues in the clinical environment. Nurse practice can utilize these findings to increase awareness among experienced nurses on recognizing how pandemic situations can impact to their decision-making capability."
https://openalex.org/W3174378388,"Physical inactivity and high sitting time are directly related to mortality and morbidity of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Thus, improved understanding of the prevalence and trends of these behaviors could support the design of policies and interventions for NCDs prevention.To determine the current prevalence of physical inactivity and high sitting time, to analyze the trends, and to estimate the association of meeting/not meeting physical activity recommendations and low/high sitting time with sociodemographic characteristics and body mass index categories.Data from the 2018 National Health and Nutrition Survey were used. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sitting minutes per week were calculated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ). In total, 38,033 questionnaires of adults aged 20 to 69-year-old were analyzed. Adults were classified as physically inactive if they achieved less than 150 minutes per week of MVPA and as with high sitting time if they accumulated more than 420 minutes of sitting per day. Health and Nutrition National Surveys (ENSANUT) 2006, 2012 and 2018 were used to estimate the trends.In total, 16.5% were classified as physically inactive and 11.3% within the high sitting time category. Both prevalences increased more than 40% during the 12-y period (2006-2018). In 2018, men, younger adults, those living in urban areas, and people within the highest socioeconomical status and educational levels were more likely to not achieve physical activity recommendations and to be classified in the highest sitting time category.To stop current increased trends and achieve global targets, stronger and more concerted efforts to promote physical activity and reduce sitting time are required. Thus, continued surveillance of these behaviors is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3176011664,"Angiogenesis is essential for the sustained growth of solid tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of angiogenesis and constitutive activation of HIF-1 is frequently observed in human cancers. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms governing the activation of HIF-1 is critical for successful therapeutic targeting of tumor angiogenesis. Herein, we establish a new regulatory mechanism responsible for the constitutive activation of HIF-1α in cancer, irrespective of oxygen tension. PIM1 kinase directly phosphorylates HIF-1α at threonine 455, a previously uncharacterized site within its oxygen-dependent degradation domain. This phosphorylation event disrupts the ability of prolyl hydroxylases to bind and hydroxylate HIF-1α, interrupting its canonical degradation pathway and promoting constitutive transcription of HIF-1 target genes. Moreover, phosphorylation of the analogous site in HIF-2α (S435) stabilizes the protein through the same mechanism, indicating post-translational modification within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain as a mechanism of regulating the HIF-α subunits. In vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that expression of PIM1 is sufficient to stabilize HIF-1α and HIF-2α in normoxia and stimulate angiogenesis in a HIF-1-dependent manner. CRISPR mutants of HIF-1α (Thr455D) promoted increased tumor growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Moreover, HIF-1α-T455D xenograft tumors were refractory to the anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic effects of PIM inhibitors. These data identify a new signaling axis responsible for hypoxia-independent activation of HIF-1 and expand our understanding of the tumorigenic role of PIM1 in solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3177123926,"Peritoneal metastasis is a common issue in the progression of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), yet the underlying mechanism remains unconfirmed. We demonstrated that ZEB2, the transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), was upregulated in ascites cells from HGSOC patients and in CD133+ cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of ZEB2 in EOC cells decreased the percentage of CSLCs and reduced the colony forming potential, cell invasion capacity and expression of pluripotent genes Oct4 and Nanog. Inhibition of ZEB2 also induced cellular apoptosis and impacted the tumorigenicity of ovarian CSLCs. The mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin were downregulated, while the epithelial marker E-cadherin was upregulated after ZEB2 knockdown. MiR-200a, a molecule that downregulates ZEB2, had the opposite effect of ZEB2 expression in EOC-CSLCs. A retrospective study of 98 HGSOC patients on the relationship of ascites volume, pelvic and abdominal metastasis, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and the malignant involvement of abdominal organs and lymph nodes was performed. Patients with high expression of ZEB2 in tumour tissues had a higher metastasis rate and a poorer prognosis than those with low expression. The parameters of ZEB2 expression and ascites volume were strongly linked with the prognostic outcome of HGSOC patients and had higher hazard ratios. These findings illustrated that ZEB2 facilitates the invasive metastasis of EOC-CSLCs and can predict peritoneal metastasis and a poor prognosis in HGSOC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3173336736,"Background Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are commonly used to evaluate surgical outcome in patients undergoing joint replacement surgery, however routine collection from the target population is often incomplete. Representative samples are required to allow inference from the sample to the population. Although higher capture rates are desired, the extent to which this improves the representativeness of the sample is not known. We aimed to measure the representativeness of data collected using an electronic PROMs capture system with or without telephone call follow up, and any differences in PROMS reporting between electronic and telephone call follow up. Methods Data from a pilot PROMs program within a large national joint replacement registry were examined. Telephone call follow up was used for people that failed to respond electronically. Data were collected pre-operatively and at 6 months post-operatively. Responding groups (either electronic only or electronic plus telephone call follow up) were compared to non-responders based on patient characteristics (joint replaced, bilaterality, age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score and Body Mass Index (BMI)) using chi squared test or ANOVA, and PROMs for the two responder groups were compared using generalised linear models adjusted for age and sex. The analysis was restricted to those undergoing primary elective hip, knee or shoulder replacement for osteoarthritis. Results Pre-operatively, 73.2% of patients responded electronically and telephone follow-up of non-responders increased this to 91.4%. Pre-operatively, patients responding electronically, compared to all others, were on average younger, more likely to be female, and healthier (lower ASA score). Similar differences were found when telephone follow up was included in the responding group. There were little (if any) differences in the post-operative comparisons, where electronic responders were on average one year younger and were more likely to have a lower ASA score compared to those not responding electronically, but there was no significant difference in sex or BMI. PROMs were similar between those reporting electronically and those reporting by telephone. Conclusion Patients undergoing total joint replacement who provide direct electronic PROMs data are younger, healthier and more likely to be female than non-responders, but these differences are small, particularly for post-operative data collection. The addition of telephone call follow up to electronic contact does not provide a more representative sample. Electronic-only follow up of patients undergoing joint replacement provides a satisfactory representation of the population invited to participate."
https://openalex.org/W3173684555,"Exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with white matter damage and neurocognitive decline. However, the mechanisms of this injury are not well understood and remain largely uncharacterized in experimental models. Prior studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter (PM), a sub-fraction of air pollution, results in neuroinflammation, specifically the upregulation of inflammatory microglia. This study examines white matter and axonal injury, and characterizes microglial reactivity in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to 10 weeks (150 hours) of PM. Nanoscale particulate matter (nPM, aerodynamic diameter ≤200 nm) consisting primarily of traffic-related emissions was collected from an urban area in Los Angeles. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either re-aerosolized nPM or filtered air for 5 hours/day, 3 days/week, for 10 weeks (150 hours; n = 18/group). Microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (Iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to identify pro-inflammatory cells, and Iba-1 with arginase-1 (Arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. Myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dMBP). Oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2). Axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker SMI-312. iNOS-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to nPM when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). This was accompanied by an increase in dMBP (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament SMI-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. Exposure to nPM results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. iNOS-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model."
https://openalex.org/W3173777484,"Filoviruses (Family Filoviridae genera Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus) are negative-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe health effects in humans and non-human primates, including death. Except in outbreak settings, vaccines and other medical countermeasures against Ebola virus (EBOV) will require testing under the FDA Animal Rule. Multiple vaccine candidates have been evaluated using cynomolgus monkeys (CM) exposed to EBOV Kikwit strain. To the best of our knowledge, however, animal model development data supporting the use of CM in vaccine research have not been submitted to the FDA. This study describes a large CM database (122 CM, 62 female and 60 male, age 2 to 9 years) and demonstrates the consistency of the CM model through time to death models and descriptive statistics. CMs were exposed to EBOV doses of 0.1 to 100,000 PFU in 33 studies conducted at three Animal Biosafety Level 4 facilities, by three exposure routes. Time to death was modeled using Cox proportional hazards models with a frailty term that incorporated study-to-study variability. Despite significant differences attributed to exposure variables, all CMs exposed to the 100 to 1,000 pfu doses commonly used in vaccine studies died or met euthanasia criteria within 21 days of exposure, median 7 days, 93% between 5 and 12 days of exposure. Moderate clinical signs were observed 4 to 5 days after exposure and preceded death or euthanasia by approximately one day. Viremia was detected within a few days of infection. Hematology indices were indicative of viremia and the propensity for hemorrhage with progression of Ebola viremia. Changes associated with coagulation parameters and platelets were consistent with coagulation disruption. Changes in leukocyte profiles were indicative of an acute inflammatory response. Increased liver enzymes were observed shortly after exposure. Taken together, these factors suggest that the cynomolgus monkey is a reliable animal model for human disease."

https://openalex.org/W3173707788,"Introduction Although the maternal mortality ratio has decreased by 38% in the last decade, 810 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth every day, and two-thirds of maternal deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. The lives of women and newborns before, during, and after childbirth can be saved by skilled care. The main factors that prevent women from receiving care during pregnancy and childbirth are harmful cultural practices. The aim of this study was to assess the level of harmful cultural practices during pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal period, and associated factors among women of childbearing age in Southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in the Gurage zone, among representative sample of 422 women of reproductive age who had at least one history of childbirth. A simple random sampling technique was used to recruit participants. Data were collected by six experienced and trained data collectors using a pretested structured questionnaire with face to face interviews. Harmful cultural practices are assessed using 11 questions and those who participate in any one of them are considered as harmful cultural practices. Descriptive statistics were performed and the findings were presented in text and tables. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between each independent variable and outcome variable. Results Harmful cultural practices were found to be 71.4% [95%CI, 66.6–76.0]. The mean age of study participants was 27.6 (SD ± 5.4 years). Women with no formal education [AOR 3.79; 95%CI, 1.97–7.28], being a rural resident [AOR 4.41, 95%CI, 2.63–7.39], having had no antenatal care in the last pregnancy [AOR 2.62, 95%CI, 1.54–4.48], and pregnancy being attended by untrained attendants [AOR 2.67, 95%CI, 1.58–4.51] were significantly associated with harmful cultural practice during the perinatal period. Conclusion In this study we found that low maternal education, rural residence, lack of antenatal care and lack of trained birth attendant were independent risk factors associated with women employing harmful cultural practices during the perinatal period. Thus, strong multi-sectoral collaboration targeted at improving women’s educational status and primary health care workers should take up the active role of women’s health education on the importance of ANC visits to tackle harmful cultural practices."
https://openalex.org/W3175990549,"The cycling performance of supercapacitors sometimes becomes limited when electrode materials slough off during frequent charge–discharge cycles, due to weak bonding between the active material and the current collector. In this work, a flexible graphite foil substrate was successfully used as the current collector for supercapacitor electrodes. Graphite foil substrates were treated in different ways with different acid concentrations and temperatures before being coated with an active material (NiMoO 4 /nanographite). The electrode treated with HNO 3 (65%) and H 2 SO 4 (95%) in a 1:1 ratio at 24°C gave better electrochemical performance than did electrodes treated in other ways. This electrode had capacitances of 441 and 184 Fg –1 at current densities of 0.5 and 10 Ag -1 , respectively, with a good rate capability over the current densities of the other treated electrodes. SEM observation of the electrodes revealed that NiMoO 4 with a morphology of nanorods 100–120 nm long was properly accommodated on the graphite surface during the charge–discharge process. It also showed that treatment with high-concentration acid created an appropriately porous and rough surface on the graphite, enhancing the adhesion of NiMoO 4 /nanographite and boosting the electrochemical performance."
https://openalex.org/W3175380258,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality has declined substantially over the past decades thanks to advancing medical and interventional/surgical treatments; therefore, the prognostic value of the heart rate variability in CAD in the current treatment era is not well established. We evaluated the prognostic significance of baseline heart rate variability in 1,757 ARTEMIS study patients with angiographically verified CAD. During an average follow-up time of 8.7 ± 2.2 years, a total of 285 (16.2%) patients died. Of the patients, 63 (3.6%) suffered sudden cardiac death or were resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest (SCD/SCA), 60 (3.4%) experienced non-sudden cardiac death (NSCD), and death attributable to non-cardiac causes (NCD) occurred in 162 (9.2%) patients. For every 10 ms decrease in standard deviation of normal to normal intervals the risk for SCD/SCA, NSCD and NCD increased significantly: HR 1.153 (95% CI 1.075–1.236, p&lt;0.001), HR 1.187 (95% CI 1.102–1.278, p&lt;0.001) and HR 1.080 (95% CI 1.037–1.125, p&lt;0.001), respectively. The natural logarithm of the low-frequency component of the power spectrum and the short-term scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis also had significant association with all modes of death (p&lt;0.001). After relevant adjustment, standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals retained its association with NSCD and NCD (p&lt;0.01), the natural logarithm of the low-frequency component of the power spectrum with all modes of death (p from &lt;0.05 to &lt;0.01), and the short-term scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis with SCD/SCA (p&lt;0.05) and NCD (p&lt;0.001). In conclusion, impairment of many measures of heart rate variability predicts mortality but is not associated with any specific mode of death in patients with stable CAD during the current treatment era, limiting the clinical applicability of heart rate variability to targeting therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3174266874,"Keratinocyte migration into skin wounds is the step of the healing process that correlates with the wound closure rate. Keratinocyte migration, and wound epithelialization are decreased when beta 2-adrenergic receptors (B2AR) are activated by 1 μM epinephrine/adrenaline, resulting in delayed wound healing in human and mouse skin. In the present study, we found paradoxically, that in a subset of keratinocyte strains exposure to low concentrations of epinephrine (0.1 nM) increased, rather than decreased, their migratory rate. We find that both the alpha- and the beta-adrenergic receptors are expressed in human keratinocytes, and expression of alpha-2 AR subtypes demonstrated for the first time. Therefore, we tested if the alpha-AR could be modulating the increased migratory response observed in these cell strains. By using specific inhibitors to alpha-AR, we demonstrated that blocking A2B-AR could reverse the rapid cell migration induced by the 0.1 nM epinephrine. Phosphorylation of ERK was elevated after 1-10 minutes of the low epinephrine treatment and the A2B-AR inhibitor blocked the ERK phosphorylation. The results suggest that both the A2B-AR and B2AR mediate keratinocyte migration, in which with a low level of epinephrine treatment, A2B-AR could alter the B2AR signals and regulate the migration rate."
https://openalex.org/W3176727563,"The relentless role of invasive species in the extinction of native biota requires predictions of ecosystem vulnerability to inform proactive management strategies. The worldwide invasion and range expansion of predatory northern pike ( Esox lucius ) has been linked to the decline of native fishes and tools are needed to predict the vulnerability of habitats to invasion over broad geographic scales. To address this need, we coupled an intrinsic potential habitat modelling approach with a Bayesian network to evaluate the vulnerability of five culturally and economically vital species of Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.) to invasion by northern pike. This study was conducted along 22,875 stream km in the Southcentral region of Alaska, USA. Pink salmon ( O . gorbuscha ) were the most vulnerable species, with 15.2% (2,458 km) of their calculated extent identified as “highly” vulnerable, followed closely by chum salmon ( O . keta , 14.8%; 2,557 km) and coho salmon ( O . kisutch , 14.7%; 2,536 km). Moreover, all five Pacific salmon species were highly vulnerable in 1,001 stream km of shared habitat. This simple to implement, adaptable, and cost-effective framework will allow prioritizing habitats for early detection and monitoring of invading northern pike."

The levels of individual amino acids were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Low-molecular-weight compounds were measured through metabolome analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Although the levels of individual nutrients and amino acids were strongly influenced by the germination process, the elicitation process had little effect on the change in the contents of individual nutrients and amino acids. However, after analyzing approximately 700 metabolites using metabolome analysis, we found that the levels of many of the metabolites were strongly influenced by soybean– A . oryzae interactions. In particular, the data indicate that steroid, terpenoid, phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and fatty acid metabolism were influenced by the elicitation process. Furthermore, we demonstrated that not the germination process but the elicitation process induced daidzein prenylation, suggesting that the soybean– A . oryzae interactions produce various phytoalexins that are valuable for health promotion and/or disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3175450701,"In 2009, the United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported the optimal gestational weight gain (GWG) during twin pregnancy based on the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). However, there are ethnic variations in the relationship between GWG and pregnancy outcomes. We aimed to establish the criteria for optimal GWG during twin pregnancy in Japan. The study included cases of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy registered in the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology Successive Pregnancy Birth Registry System between 2013 and 2017. We analyzed data for cases wherein both babies were appropriate for gestational age and delivered at term. Cases were classified into four groups based on the pre-pregnancy BMI: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 kg/m2 ≤BMI< 25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0 kg/m2 ≤BMI< 30.0 kg/m2), and obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2) and we calculated the 25th-75th percentile range for GWG for the cases. The 3,936 cases were included. The GWG ranges were 11.5-16.5 kg, 10.3-16.0 kg, 6.9-14.7 kg, and 2.2-11.7 kg in the underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese groups, respectively. Thus, in the current study, the optimal GWG during twin pregnancy was lower than that specified by the IOM criteria. Factoring this in maternal management may improve the outcomes of twin pregnancies in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W3175502329,"Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) was developed by Japanese companies over 20 years ago. SAEW has the advantage of potent sterilizing action while being relatively safe. This study evaluated the potential application of SAEW in spatial disinfection. Prior to experiments involving spatial spraying, the ability of SAEW to remove seven type of microorganisms that cause food poisoning was studied in vitro. Results indicated that free chlorine in SAEW, even at a low concentration (30 mg/L), was able to remove Cladosporium cladosporioides, a typical airborne fungus that degrades food, and spores such as Bacillus subtilis, a hardy bacterium. In an experiment involving spatial spraying, 3.43 log10 CFU/100 L of Staphylococcus epidermidis was sprayed in a room-sized space; the same space was then sprayed with SAEW. The number of settling microbes was measured and the sterilizing ability of SAEW was assessed. Results indicated that the concentration of S. epidermidis in the space was completely removed after 20 minutes of SAEW spraying. The above findings indicate that SAEW may be used to remove airborne microorganisms via spatial spraying."
https://openalex.org/W3177412139,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important disease for dairy productivity, as well as having the potential for zoonotic transmission. Previous prevalence studies of bTB in the dairy sector in central Ethiopia have suggested high prevalence, however, they have been limited to relatively small scale surveys, raising concerns about their representativeness. Here we carried out a cross sectional one-stage cluster sampling survey taking the dairy herd as a cluster to estimate the prevalence of bTB in dairy farms in six areas of central Ethiopia. The survey, which to date is by far the largest in the area in terms of the number of dairy farms, study areas and risk factors explored, took place from March 2016 to May 2017. This study combined tuberculin skin testing and the collection of additional herd and animal level data by questionnaire to identify potential risk factors contributing to bTB transmission. We applied the single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) test using &gt;4mm cut-off for considering an individual animal as positive for bTB; at least one reactor animal was required for a herd to be considered bTB positive. Two hundred ninety-nine dairy herds in the six study areas were randomly selected, from which 5,675 cattle were tested. The overall prevalence of bTB after standardisation for herd-size in the population was 54.4% (95% CI 48.7–60%) at the herd level, and it was 24.5% (95% CI 23.3–25.8) at the individual animal level. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with herd and area as random effect was used to explore risk factors association with bTB status. We found that herd size, age, bTB history at farm, and breed were significant risk factors for animals to be SICCT positive. Animals from large herds had 8.3 times the odds of being tuberculin reactor (OR: 8.3, p-value:0.008) as compared to animals from small herds. The effect of age was strongest for animals 8–10 years of age (the oldest category) having 8.9 times the odds of being tuberculin reactors (OR: 8.9, p-value:&lt;0.001) compared to the youngest category. The other identified significant risk factors were bTB history at farm (OR: 5.2, p-value:0.003) and cattle breed (OR: 2.5, p-value: 0.032). Our study demonstrates a high prevalence of bTB in central Ethiopia but with a large variation in within-herd prevalence between herds, findings that lays an important foundation for the future development of control strategies."

The main objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with recurrence of HIV-associated KS. We recruited a cohort of individuals on antiretroviral therapy who were in remission for HIV-associated KS after undergoing cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy. Collected variables included sociodemographic and clinical parameters, cytokines and chemokines, HIV viral loads, and CD4 counts. Compared to individuals who had KS recurrence, IL-5 was significantly higher at time of follow-up in individuals who had sustained remission (22.7pg/ml vs. 2.4pg/ml; p = 0.02); IL-6 was significantly higher at baseline and time of follow-up in individuals who had sustained remission, (18.4pg/ml vs. 0pg/ml; p = 0.01) and (18.0pg/ml vs. 0.18pg/ml; p = 0.03) respectively; IP-10 was significantly lower at baseline and at time of follow-up in individuals who had sustained remission, (534pg/ml vs. 920pg/ml; p = 0.04) and (446pg/ml vs.1098pg/ml; p = 0.01) respectively; while HIV viral load was significantly lower at baseline and at time of follow-up in individuals who had sustained remission, (0copies/ml vs. 113copies/ml; p = 0.004) and (0copies/ml vs. 152copies/ml; p = 0.025) respectively. Plasma levels of IL-5, IL-6, and IP-10 are associated with recurrence of HIV-associated KS, while persistently detectable HIV viral loads increase the risk of KS recurrence."

The bite force (%) of the prostheses, teeth and segments at the maximum intercuspation position (MIP) was evaluated using a T-scan at 5 stages (pre-placement, immediately following placement, and 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-placement).The occlusal force of implant-supported prostheses was significantly (P = .000) lower than those of the control natural teeth at the baseline, then no significant difference was found with that of the mesial teeth at 3 months, and finally it was significantly (P = .000) lower than that of the distal teeth at 6 months; meanwhile, it significantly (P = .008) increased by a mean of 2.04 times from 2 weeks (3.39 ± 2.61%) to 3 months (6.90 ± 4.77%), whereas no significant difference (P = .900) was found from 3 months (6.90 ± 4.77%) to 6 months (7.31 ± 4.60%). In addition, the bite force of the posterior segment on the restored side of both unilateral and bilateral gaps was significantly (P = .013,.001) improved by 3.31% and 6.83%, respectively, although the discrepancy in bite force significantly (P = .039) increased from an initial 3.52% to 5.02% for subjects with bilateral defects, accompanying increases in the proportion (15.38%) of the level III bilateral bite force deviation (P >.05).Bite force and masticatory ability can be improved with the immediate delivery of a single posterior implant restoration. The bite force distributed on the implant prosthesis inevitably increases after placement of implant prostheses, a routine follow-up and occlusal evaluation are strongly needed."
https://openalex.org/W3176165823,"Background Early symptoms of worsening heart failure are difficult for patients to detect and manage, contributing to the high readmission rate for worsening heart failure. Thus, it is important to promote self-monitoring and to support patients in recognizing and interpreting their symptoms. This study aimed to explore the ways in which specialized nurses in the outpatient setting provide support for self-monitoring in patients with chronic heart failure in Japan. Methods This exploratory study adopted a qualitative study design. The participants were a convenience sample of five nurses certified in chronic heart failure nursing and one advanced practice nurse certified in chronic care nursing, all with experience in outpatient nursing in Japan. Data were collected from June 2017 to October 2017 through semi-structured one-on-one interviews and were analyzed using an established qualitative inductive method. Results The analysis identified seven themes describing the nursing support provided by the study participants. Among these were three themes describing different forms of direct support for self-monitoring: “Encourage patients to reflect on their own,” “Support touching the body and developing body awareness,” and “Support sharing the task.” Two themes described practice perspectives: “Support self-monitoring that is not overly sensitive” and “Support connection with the patient’s life.” Two final themes described contextual factors in the outpatient care setting: “Struggling with constraints and powerlessness” and “Building a support system in the outpatient setting.” Conclusions The findings provide a practice for nurses promoting self-monitoring in patients with chronic heart failure in the outpatient setting. The study findings inform and provide goals for the support of self-monitoring in patients with heart failure and also, suggest the need to establish a strong support system for outpatient care in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W3173898021,"The proportion of Staphylococcus aureus in the skin microbiome is associated with the severity of inflammation in the skin disease atopic dermatitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, a commensal skin bacterium, inhibits the growth of S. aureus in the skin. Therefore, the balance between S. epidermidis and S. aureus in the skin microbiome is important for maintaining healthy skin. In the present study, we demonstrated that the heat-treated culture supernatant of Delftia acidovorans, a member of the skin microbiome, inhibits the growth of S. epidermidis, but not that of S. aureus. Comprehensive gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing revealed that culture supernatant of D. acidovorans increased the expression of genes related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle in S. epidermidis. Malonate, an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle, suppressed the inhibitory effect of the heat-treated culture supernatant of D. acidovorans on the growth of S. epidermidis. Reactive oxygen species production in S. epidermidis was induced by the heat-treated culture supernatant of D. acidovorans and suppressed by malonate. Further, the inhibitory effect of the heat-treated culture supernatant of D. acidovorans on the growth of S. epidermidis was suppressed by N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a free radical scavenger. These findings suggest that heat-resistant substances secreted by D. acidovorans inhibit the growth of S. epidermidis by inducing the production of reactive oxygen species via the TCA cycle."
https://openalex.org/W3174020188,"Although relationships between intestinal morphology between trophic groups in reptiles are widely assumed and represent a cornerstone of ecomorphological narratives, few comparative approaches actually tested this hypothesis on a larger scale. We collected data on lengths of intestinal sections of 205 reptile species for which either body mass (BM), snout-vent-length (SVL) or carapax length (CL) was recorded, transforming SVL or CL into BM if the latter was not given, and analyzed scaling patterns with BM and SVL, accounting for phylogeny, comparing three trophic guilds (faunivores, omnivores, herbivores), and comparing with a mammal dataset. Length-BM relationships in reptiles were stronger for the small than the large intestine, suggesting that for the latter, additional factors might be relevant. Adding trophic level did not consistently improve model fit; only when controlling for phylogeny, models indicated a longer large intestine in herbivores, due to a corresponding pattern in lizards. Trophic level effects were highly susceptible to sample sizes, and not considered strong. Models that linked BM to intestine length had better support than models using SVL, due to the deviating body shape of snakes. At comparable BM, reptiles had shorter intestines than mammals. While the latter finding corresponds to findings of lower tissue masses for the digestive tract and other organs in reptiles as well as our understanding of differences in energetic requirements between the classes, they raise the hitherto unanswered question what it is that reptiles of similar BM have more than mammals. A lesser effect of trophic level on intestine lengths in reptiles compared to mammals may stem from lesser selective pressures on differentiation between trophic guilds, related to the generally lower food intake and different movement patterns of reptiles, which may not similarly escalate evolutionary arms races tuned to optimal agility as between mammalian predators and prey."
https://openalex.org/W3175953917,"Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) is highly informative yet technically challenging. Until recently, there has been little information about EEG data quality and safety when used with newer multi-band (MB) fMRI sequences. Here, we measure the relative heating of a MB protocol compared with a standard single-band (SB) protocol considered to be safe. We also evaluated EEG quality recorded concurrently with the MB protocol on humans.We compared radiofrequency (RF)-related heating at multiple electrodes and magnetic field magnitude, B1+RMS, of a MB fMRI sequence with whole-brain coverage (TR = 440 ms, MB factor = 4) against a previously recommended, safe SB sequence using a phantom outfitted with a 64-channel EEG cap. Next, 9 human subjects underwent eyes-closed resting state EEG-fMRI using the MB sequence. Additionally, in three of the subjects resting state EEG was recorded also during the SB sequence and in an fMRI-free condition to directly compare EEG data quality across scanning conditions. EEG data quality was assessed by the ability to remove gradient and cardioballistic artifacts along with a clean spectrogram.The heating induced by the MB sequence was lower than that of the SB sequence by a factor of 0.73 ± 0.38. This is consistent with an expected heating ratio of 0.64, calculated from the square of the ratio of B1+RMS values of the sequences. In the resting state EEG data, gradient and cardioballistic artifacts were successfully removed using traditional template subtraction. All subjects showed an individual alpha peak in the spectrogram with a posterior topography characteristic of eyes-closed EEG. The success of artifact rejection for the MB sequence was comparable to that in traditional SB sequences.Our study shows that B1+RMS is a useful indication of the relative heating of fMRI protocols. This observation indicates that simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings using this MB sequence can be safe in terms of RF-related heating, and that EEG data recorded using this sequence is of acceptable quality after traditional artifact removal techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3174772931,"Prevalence of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 in aquatic reservoirs in Bangladesh apparently increases coinciding with the occurrence of seasonal cholera epidemics. In between epidemics, these bacteria persist in water mostly as dormant cells, known as viable but non-culturable cells (VBNC), or conditionally viable environmental cells (CVEC), that fail to grow in routine culture. CVEC resuscitate to active cells when enriched in culture medium supplemented with quorum sensing autoinducers CAI-1 or AI-2 which are signal molecules that regulate gene expression dependent on cell density. V . cholerae O1 mutant strains with inactivated cqsS gene encoding the CAI-1 receptor has been shown to overproduce AI-2 that enhance CVEC resuscitation in water samples. Since V . cholerae non-O1 non-O139 (non-cholera-vibrios) are abundant in aquatic ecosystems, we identified and characterized naturally occurring variant strains of V . cholerae non-O1 non-O139 which overproduce AI-2, and monitored their co-occurrence with V . cholerae O1 in water samples. The nucleotide sequence and predicted protein products of the cqsS gene carried by AI-2 overproducing variant strains showed divergence from that of typical V . cholerae O1 or non-O1 strains, and their culture supernatants enhanced resuscitation of CVEC in water samples. Furthermore, prevalence of V . cholerae O1 in the aquatic environment was found to coincide with an increase in AI-2 overproducing non-O1 non-O139 strains. These results suggest a possible role of non-cholera vibrios in the environmental biology of the cholera pathogen, in which non-O1 non-O139 variant strains overproducing AI-2 presumably contribute in resuscitation of the latent pathogen, leading to seasonal cholera epidemics. Importance . Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae which causes seasonal epidemics of cholera persists in aquatic reservoirs in endemic areas. The bacteria mostly exist in a dormant state during inter-epidemic periods, but periodically resuscitate to the active form. The resuscitation is enhanced by signal molecules called autoinducers (AIs). Toxigenic V . cholerae can be recovered from water samples that normally test negative for the organism in conventional culture, by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous AIs. V . cholerae belonging to the non-O1 non-O139 serogroups which do not cause cholera are also abundant in natural waters, and they are capable of producing AIs. In this study we characterized V . cholerae non-O1 non-O139 variant strains which overproduce an autoinducer called AI-2, and found that the abundance of the cholera pathogen in aquatic reservoirs correlates with an increase in the AI-2 overproducing strains. Our results suggest a probable role of these variant strains in the environmental biology and epidemiology of toxigenic V . cholerae , and may lead to novel means for surveillance, prevention and control of cholera."
https://openalex.org/W3175266973,"This study presents a real-time algorithm for even distributing the torque burden on the parallel manipulator with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through the cooperation of the AUV and manipulator. For the redundant resolution of the underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS), we used the weighting matrix of the weighted pseudo inverse for kinematic and dynamic modeling. We made dynamic and kinematic modeling using the force distribution characteristics of parallel manipulators. Using the parallel manipulator's model, the weighting matrix was changed every second to share the manipulator torque with the AUV. The Taguchi method was used to reduce the calculation time for real-time calculation and to perform valve rotation operations with as little torque as possible even in an underwater environment where it is difficult to determine any cause of errors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm, we experimented with valve rotation in water using the UVMS. Analysis of the experimental results revealed that the manipulator torque load was greatly reduced due to the AUV load distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3175373151,"This study aimed to develop culturally sensitive pain neuroscience education (PNE) materials for Hausa speaking patients with chronic spinal pain (CSP). PNE is a program of teaching patients about pain that has gained considerable attention in research and is increasingly used during physical therapy for patients with chronic pain. It helps in decreasing pain, disability, fear-avoidance, pain catastrophization, movement restriction, and health care utilization among patients with chronic pain. However, existing PNE materials and their application are limited to few languages and cultural inclinations. Due to the variations in pain perceptions, beliefs, and related outcomes among different population groups, culture-sensitive PNE materials addressing these outcomes are warranted. A focus-group discussion comprising 4 experts was used to adapt and develop preliminary PNE materials. Thereafter, an internet-based 3-round modified Delphi-study involving 22 experts ensued. Experts' consensus/recommendations concerning the content were used in modifying the PNE materials. Consensus was predefined as ≥75% level of (dis)agreement. Eighteen experts completed the Delphi rounds. Nineteen, 18 and 18 experts participated in rounds 1, 2 and 3 respectively, representing 86%, 94% and 100% participation rate respectively. Consensus agreement was reached in every round and content of the materials, including drawings, examples, figures and metaphors were adapted following the experts' suggestions. We therefore concluded that, culture-sensitive PNE materials for Hausa speaking patients with CSP were successfully produced. The present study also provides a direction for further research whereby the effects of culturally-sensitive PNE materials can be piloted among Hausa speaking patients with CSP."

Pearson correlations were used to assess post-donation kidney function with renography and CT-based measurements. Furthermore, we examined high risk groups with SKF difference greater than 10% on renography and donors with post-donation eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2.62% of donors were women with a mean (standard deviation) pre-donation eGFR 99 (20) and post-donation eGFR 67 (22) mL/min/1.73m2 at 31 months of follow-up. Post-donation kidney function was poorly correlated with both CT-based measurements and renography, including the subgroup of donors with post-donation eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (r less than 0.4 for all). There was agreement between CT-based measurements and renography for SKF determination (Bland-Altman agreement [bias, 95% limits of agreement] for renography vs: CT volume, 0.76%, -7.60-9.15%; modified ellipsoid,1.01%, -8.38-10.42%; CC dimension, 0.44%, -7.06-7.94); however, CT missed SKF greater than 10% found by renography in 20 out 26 (77%) of donors.In a single centre study of 248 living donors, we found no correlation between CT or renography and post-donation eGFR. Further research is needed to determine optimal ways to predict remaining kidney function after donation."
https://openalex.org/W3177295181,"During archaeological excavations in burial sites, sometimes stoned organic objects are found, in addition to human remains. Those objects might be of a different origin, depending on various factors influencing members of a community (i.e. diseases, trauma), which provides information about their living conditions. The St. Nicholas Church archaeological site (Libkovice, Czechia) in the 18 th century horizon of the cemetery, yielded a maturus-senilis female skeleton with a stone object in the left iliac fossa. This object was an oviform cyst-like rough structure, measuring 54 mm in length, 35 mm in maximum diameter and 0.2–0.7 mm shell thickness. Within the object there were small fetal bones (long bones, i.e. femur and two tibias, two scapulas, three ribs, vertebrae and other tiny bone fragments). Methods utilized to analyze the outer and inner surface morphology of the cyst and its inside, included: X-ray, CT imaging, SEM, histological staining and EDS. The EDS analysis revealed the presence of primarily oxygen, calcium and phosphorus in bone samples, and oxygen and silicon, in stone shell. Based on the length of the femur (20.2 mm) and tibia (16 mm) shafts, the fetal age was determined as being in the 15–18 week of pregnancy. The differential diagnosis was conducted, including for the three most probable cases: fetiform teratoma (FT), fetus-in-fetu (FIF) and lithopedion . The possibility of fetiform teratoma was discounted due to the presence of an anatomically correct spine, long bones and the proportions of the find. Although the low calcium content in the shell (2.3% atom mass), the lack of skull bones and the better developed lower limbs indicate fetus-in-fetu rather than lithopedion , the analyses results are unable to conclusively identify the object under one of these two categories since there are insufficient such cases in excavation material with which to draw comparison."
https://openalex.org/W3173182817,"The water film depth is a key variable that affects traffic safety under rainfall conditions. According to the Federal Highway Administration, approximately 5700 people are killed and more than 544 700 people are injured in crashes on wet pavements annually. While several studies have attempted to address water film depth issues by establishing prediction models, a few focused on the relationship among road geometric features, capacity of drainage facilities and water film depth. To ascertain the influence of the geometric features of road and facility drainage capacities on the water film depth, the road geometry features were first classified into four types, and the facility drainage capacities were considered from three aspects in this study. Furthermore, the concept of short-time rainfall grade was proposed according to the results of the field test. Finally, the theoretical prediction model for the water film depth was conceived, based on the geometric features of road and facility drainage capacities with different rainfall intensities. Compared with the traditional regression prediction models, the theoretical prediction model clearly shows the effects of the geometric features of road and facility drainage capacities. When the road drainage facilities have no drainage capacity, the water film depth increases rapidly with the rainfall intensity. This model can be used to predict the water film depth of road surfaces on rainy days, evaluate the effect of rainfall on the driving environment, and provide guidance for determining safety control measures on rainy days."
https://openalex.org/W3173617263,"Discovering low-dimensional structure in real-world networks requires a suitable null model that defines the absence of meaningful structure. Here we introduce a spectral approach for detecting a network's low-dimensional structure, and the nodes that participate in it, using any null model. We use generative models to estimate the expected eigenvalue distribution under a specified null model, and then detect where the data network's eigenspectra exceed the estimated bounds. On synthetic networks, this spectral estimation approach cleanly detects transitions between random and community structure, recovers the number and membership of communities, and removes noise nodes. On real networks spectral estimation finds either a significant fraction of noise nodes or no departure from a null model, in stark contrast to traditional community detection methods. Across all analyses, we find the choice of null model can strongly alter conclusions about the presence of network structure. Our spectral estimation approach is therefore a promising basis for detecting low-dimensional structure in real-world networks, or lack thereof."
https://openalex.org/W3173748514,"Vascular endothelial dysfunction is an essential part of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and its complications. In type 2 diabetes, endothelial dysfunction is characterized by reduced insulin signaling and increased transendothelial transport of fatty acids (FA). As the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib was previously shown to reverse type 2 diabetes and to inhibit VEGF signaling via Abl kinases, we studied the effect of imatinib on vascular insulin sensitivity and fatty acid transport in vivo and in vitro.C57/BL6J mice were fed a chow diet or Western diet (WD), and received daily imatinib injections for two weeks. Insulin-mediated vasoreactivity of resistance arteries was studied using intravital microscopy, and metabolic insulin sensitivity using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The effect of imatinib on triglyceride content in skeletal muscle and heart in vivo was also determined. In vitro, the effect of imatinib on fatty acid transport was studied in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by evaluating the effect of imatinib on fluorescently labeled FA uptake both under basal and VEGF-B-stimulated conditions.Imatinib prevented the WD-induced weight gain in mice, independently from food intake. In line with this, imatinib enhanced insulin-mediated vasoreactivity of resistance arteries in the WD-fed mice. However, imatinib did not affect triglyceride content in muscle. In cultured endothelial cells, VEGF-B stimulation resulted in a time-dependent uptake of fatty acids in parallel with increased phosphorylation of the Abl kinase substrate Crk-like protein (CrkL) at Tyr207. Although imatinib effectively prevented VEGF-B-mediated Abl kinase activation, it had no effect on VEGF-B mediated endothelial FA uptake.Imatinib prevents weight gain and preserves insulin-mediated vasodilation in WD-fed mice, but does not affect endothelial FA transport despite inhibiting VEGF-B signaling. The beneficial effect of imatinib on insulin-mediated vasodilation may contribute to the anti-diabetic effects of imatinib."
https://openalex.org/W3174880021,"Background Admission systolic blood pressure has emerged as a predictor of postdischarge outcomes of patients with acute decompensated heart failure; however, its validity in varied clinical conditions of this patient subset is unclear. The aim of this study was to further explore the prognostic value of admission systolic blood pressure in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Methods The Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure (KCHF) registry is a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive patients with acute decompensated heart failure from 19 participating hospitals in Japan. Clinical characteristics at baseline and prognosis were examined by the following value range of admission systolic blood pressure: &lt;100, 100–139, and ≥140 mmHg. The primary outcome measure was defined as all-cause death after discharge. Subgroup analyses were done for prior hospitalization for heart failure, hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction, and medications at discharge. We excluded patients with acute coronary syndrome or insufficient data. Results We analyzed 3564 patients discharged alive out of 3804 patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure. In the entire cohort, lower admission systolic blood pressure was associated with poor outcomes (1-year cumulative incidence of all-cause death: &lt;100 mmHg, 26.8%; 100–139 mmHg, 20.2%; and ≥140 mmHg, 15.1%, p&lt;0.001). The magnitude of the effect of lower admission systolic blood pressure for postdischarge all-cause death was greater in patients with prior hospitalization for heart failure, heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and β-blocker use at discharge than in those without. Conclusions Admission systolic blood pressure is useful for postdischarge risk stratification in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Its magnitude of the effect as a prognostic predictor may differ across clinical conditions of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3176003979,"Preregistration, the open science practice of specifying and registering details of a planned study prior to knowing the data, increases the transparency and reproducibility of research. Large-scale replication attempts for psychological results yielded shockingly low success rates and contributed to an increasing demand for open science practices among psychologists. However, preregistering one's studies is still not the norm in the field. Here, we propose a study to explore possible reasons for this discrepancy.In a mixed-methods approach, an online survey will be conducted, assessing attitudes, motivations, and perceived obstacles with respect to preregistration. Participants will be psychological researchers that will be recruited by scanning research articles on Web of Science, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and PsycInfo, and preregistrations on OSF Registries (targeted sample size: N = 296). Based on the theory of planned behavior, we predict that positive attitudes (moderated by the perceived importance of preregistration) as well as a favorable subjective norm and higher perceived behavioral control positively influence researchers' intention to preregister (hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we expect an influence of research experience on attitudes and perceived motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration (hypothesis 2). We will analyze these hypotheses with multiple regression models, and will include preregistration experience as control variable."

Logistic regression estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of oral SLPI and risk of OPC and treatment outcomes. Results In crude and adjusted analyses of 96 OPC cases and 97 age- and smoking-matched controls, OPC was not significantly associated with oral gargle SLPI levels. Among cases, oral SLPI was associated with tonsillectomy (p = 0.018) and among controls oral SLPI was associated with HPV in the oral gargle (p = 0.008). Higher concentrations of SLPI was significantly associated with increased odds of incomplete treatment response (T2: OR: 12.39; 95% CI: 1.44–106.72; T3: OR: 9.86; 95% CI: 1.13–85.90) among all cases, but not among P16+ cases. Conclusions Salivary SLPI was not associated with OPC risk but was associated with higher odds of an incomplete treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W3176798453,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a causative agent of Johne’s disease, which is a chronic and debilitating disease in ruminants. MAP is also considered to be a possible cause of Crohn’s disease in humans. However, few studies have focused on the interactions between MAP and human macrophages to elucidate the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease. We sought to determine the initial responses of human THP-1 cells against MAP infection using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Clustering analysis showed that THP-1 cells were divided into seven different clusters in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment. The characteristics of each cluster were investigated by identifying cluster-specific marker genes. From the results, we found that classically differentiated cells express CD14 , CD36 , and TLR2 , and that this cell type showed the most active responses against MAP infection. The responses included the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CCL4 , CCL3 , IL1B , IL8 , and CCL20 . In addition, the Mreg cell type, a novel cell type differentiated from THP-1 cells, was discovered. Thus, it is suggested that different cell types arise even when the same cell line is treated under the same conditions. Overall, analyzing gene expression patterns via scRNA-seq classification allows a more detailed observation of the response to infection by each cell type."
https://openalex.org/W3174276991,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) that has spread globally in the last 30 years and causes huge economic losses every year. This research aims to 1) investigate the relationship between the PRRSV detection in two age categories (wean-to-market and adult/sow farm), and 2) examine the extent to which the wean-to-market PRRSV positive rate forecasts the adult/sow farm PRRSV positive rate. The data we used are the PRRSV RNA detection results between 2007 and 2019 integrated by the US Swine Disease Reporting System project that represent 95% of all porcine submissions tested in the US National Animal Health Network. We first use statistical tools to investigate to what extent the increase in PRRSV positive submissions in the wean-to-market is related to the PRRSV increase in adult/sow farms. The statistical analysis confirms that an increase in the PRRSV positive rate of wean-to-market precedes the increase in the adult/sow farms to a large extent. Then we create the dynamic exponentially weighted moving average control charts to identify out-of-control points (i.e., signals) in the PRRSV rates for both wean-to-market and adult/sow farms. This control-chart-based analysis finds that 78% of PRRSV signals in the wean-to-market are followed by a PRRSV rate signal in the adult/sow farms within eight weeks. We expect that our findings will help the producers and veterinarians to justify and reinforce the implementation of bio-security and bio-contaminant practices to curb disease spread across farms."
https://openalex.org/W3174701142,"Background Occupational health hazards are ubiquitously found in the operating room, guaranteeing an inevitable risk of exposure to the surgeon. Although provisions on occupational health and safety in healthcare exist, they do not address non-traditional hazards found in the operating room. In order to determine whether surgeons or trainees receive any form of occupational health training, we examine the associations between occupational health training and exposure rate. Study design A cross-sectional survey was distributed. Respondent characteristics included academic level, race/ethnicity, and gender. The survey evaluated seven surgical disciplines and 13 occupational hazards. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between academic level, surgical specialty, and exposure rate. Results Our cohort of 183 respondents (33.1% response rate) consisted of attendings (n = 72, 39.3%) and trainees (n = 111, 60.7%). Surgical trainees were less likely to have been trained in cytotoxic drugs (OR 0.22, p &lt;0.001), methylmethacrylate (OR 0.15, p &lt;0.001), patient lifting (OR 0.43, p = 0.009), radiation (OR 0.40, p = 0.007), and surgical smoke (OR 0.41, p = 0.041) than attending surgeons. Additionally, trainees were more likely to experience frequent exposure to bloodborne pathogens (OR 5.26, p &lt;0.001), methylmethacrylate (OR 2.86, p &lt;0.001), cytotoxic drugs (OR 3.03, p &lt;0.001), and formaldehyde (2.08, p = 0.011), to name a few. Conclusion Although surgeon safety is not a domain in residency training, standardized efforts to educate and change the culture of safety in residency programs is warranted. Our study demonstrates a disparity between trainees and attendings with a recommendation to provide formal training to trainees independent of their anticipated risk of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3175235959,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. It has been the most prevalent malignancy in Taiwan for consecutive thirteen years. Despite the diversity of its etiologic and pathophysiologic factors, a biological process named as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is indispensable in the progression of epithelial cancer. Our aim is to investigate the correlation between the expression of 8 EMT-related proteins (E-cadherin, β-catenin, claudin-1, CD44, N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin, S100A4) and the clinicopathologic features of CRC in Taiwan, along with the DNA CpG epigenetic status of CD44 gene. In immunohistochemical assessment, decreased expression of E-cadherin is statistically associated with the progression of cancer stage, while decreased expression of claudin-1 as well as increased β-catenin nuclear translocation and N-cadherin expression is statistically associated with the progression of histopathologic grade. E-cadherin, nuclear β-catenin and claudin-1 are also associated with other important prognostic factors, including nodal metastasis, tumor deposits, and elevated serum CA 19–9 levels. In addition, the left-sided colon and rectal cancers show increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin compared to the right-sided colon cancers, while the rectal cancers show increased fibronectin expression compared to the right-sided and left-sided colon cancers. Moreover, vimentin is aberrantly expressed in one case of signet-ring cell carcinoma. The DNA methylation levels of CD44 gene promoter between the tumoral and non-tumorous tissues by NGS comparison showed statistical difference on six CpG sites. However, such difference may not be sufficient because these DNA methylation proportions are too low to inactivate CD44 gene. Our results demonstrate the expression of E-cadherin, claudin-1, and nuclear β-catenin is closely related to the clinicopathologic prognostic determinants of CRC in Taiwan. The DNA methylation level of CD44 gene and its protein expression, however, show no correlation with the clinicopathologic features in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3177375244,"In Morocco, the prevalence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) continues to increase especially within previously treated cases; these MDR cases may evolve to extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) raising major concern to TB control programs. From an epidemiological window, scarce informations are available about the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains fueling these forms of resistance. The aim of this study was to assess to genetic diversity of MDR-MTB strains. Hence, this prospective study was conducted on patients diagnosed with MDR-TB at Pasteur Institute of Casablanca from 2010 to 2013. A total of 70 MDR-MTB isolates were genotyped by spoligotyping and 15-loci MIRU-VNTR methods. Spoligotyping generated four orphan patterns, five unique profiles whereas 61 strains were grouped in nine clusters (2 to 25 strains per cluster), the clustering rates being 87.1%. Subtyping by 15 loci MIRU-VNTR splitted all clusters already established by spoligotyping and generated 70 unique profiles not recognized in SITVIT2 database; clustering rate was equal to zero. HGDI analysis of 15 loci MIRU demonstrated that eight out of 15 loci were highly discriminant. Of note, all pre-XDR strains belongs to many clades, meaning that there no association between gyrA mutants and particular clade. Overall, the data generated by this study (i) describe the population structure of MDR MTBC in Morocco which is highly homogenous, (ii) confirm that TB in Morocco is almost exclusively transmitted by modern and evolutionary lineages with high level of biodiversity seen by MIRU, and (iii) validate the use of optimized 15-loci MIRU-VNTR format for future investigations in Morocco."
