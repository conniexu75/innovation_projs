https://openalex.org/W2063525006,"Fourier transform x-ray holography has been used to image gold test objects with submicrometer structure, resolving features as small as 60 nanometers. The hologram-recording instrument uses coherent 3.4-nanometer radiation from the soft x-ray undulator beamline X1A at the National Synchrotron Light Source. The specimen to be imaged is placed near the first-order focal spot produced by a Fresnel zone plate; the other orders, chiefly the zeroth, illuminate the specimen. The wave scattered by the specimen interferes with the spherical reference wave from the focal spot, forming a hologram with fringes of low spatial frequency. The hologram is recorded in digital form by a charge-coupled device camera, and the specimen image is obtained by numerical reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2033288176,"Distant Fe(2+)-Ru(3+) electronic couplings have been extracted from intramolecular electrontransfer rates in Ru(histidine(x)) (where X = 33, 39, 62, and 72) derivatives of cytochrome c. The couplings increase according to 62 (0.0060) < 72 (0.057) < 33 (0.097) < 39 (0.11 per wave numbers); however, this order is out of line with the histidine to heme edge-edge distances [62 (14.8) > 39 (12.3) > 33 (11.1) > 72 (8.4 angstroms)]. The rates (and the couplings) correlate with the lengths of sigma-tunneling pathways comprised of covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and through-space jumps from the histidines to the heme group. Space jumps greatly decrease couplings: One from Pro(71) to Met(80) extends the sigma-tunneling length of the His(72) pathway by roughly 10 covalent-bond units."
https://openalex.org/W1972308127,"Single-crystal samples of [(BEDT-TTF)(2)]+[Cu(NCS)(2)]-were synthesized and studied with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Real-space images of the anion and cation surfaces with molecular resolution were obtained. The images show no evidence of structural disorder or stacking faults previously suggested. The presence of an additional modulation commensurate with the lattice provides evidence of a lattice distortion. The cause of this modulation is unknown. The presence of a charge density wave in the material would have implications on the dimensionality of the material that may explain the peculiar temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity. This interpretation is consistent with the calculated Fermi surface, which allows nesting of the wave vector."
https://openalex.org/W2020804551,"Beginning in January 1990, the epicenters of microearthquakes associated with a 12-month increase in seismicity near Parkfield, California, moved northwest to southeast along the San Andreas fault. During this sequence of events, the locally variable rate of cumulative seismic moment increased. This increase implies a local increase in fault slip. These data suggest that a southeastwardly diffusing stress front propagated along the San Andreas fault at a speed of 30 to 50 kilometers per year. Evidently, this front did not load the Parkfield asperities fast enough to produce a moderate earthquake; however, a future front might do so."

https://openalex.org/W2037443512,"Prior to overt differentiation when they express recognizable phenotypes, cells in developing organisms are thought to pass through a state of determination in which
the decision regarding their future fate is made. Although the outcome of these processes is generally assumed to be fixed, there are numerous examples in which differentiated
cells can partially or totally switch their fate."

Suggestions, advice and objective arguments are welcomed, but polemics of all kinds will be consigned, unconsidered and unanswered, to the waste paper basket. This public notice is given only after receipt of a number of letters couched in terms which it is exceedingly difficult to construe as within the bounds of professional courtesy or diplomatic usage.
