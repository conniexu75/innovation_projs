https://openalex.org/W1976707687,"Powering future generations of implanted medical devices will require cumbersome transcutaneous energy transfer or harvesting energy from the human body. No functional solution that harvests power from the body is currently available, despite attempts to use the Seebeck thermoelectric effect, vibrations or body movements. Glucose fuel cells appear more promising, since they produce electrical energy from glucose and dioxygen, two substrates present in physiological fluids. The most powerful ones, Glucose BioFuel Cells (GBFCs), are based on enzymes electrically wired by redox mediators. However, GBFCs cannot be implanted in animals, mainly because the enzymes they rely on either require low pH or are inhibited by chloride or urate anions, present in the Extra Cellular Fluid (ECF). Here we present the first functional implantable GBFC, working in the retroperitoneal space of freely moving rats. The breakthrough relies on the design of a new family of GBFCs, characterized by an innovative and simple mechanical confinement of various enzymes and redox mediators: enzymes are no longer covalently bound to the surface of the electron collectors, which enables use of a wide variety of enzymes and redox mediators, augments the quantity of active enzymes, and simplifies GBFC construction. Our most efficient GBFC was based on composite graphite discs containing glucose oxidase and ubiquinone at the anode, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and quinone at the cathode. PPO reduces dioxygen into water, at pH 7 and in the presence of chloride ions and urates at physiological concentrations. This GBFC, with electrodes of 0.133 mL, produced a peak specific power of 24.4 microW mL(-1), which is better than pacemakers' requirements and paves the way for the development of a new generation of implantable artificial organs, covering a wide range of medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2057979362,"Background Our body schema gives the subjective impression of being highly stable. However, a number of easily-evoked illusions illustrate its remarkable malleability. In the rubber-hand illusion, illusory ownership of a rubber-hand is evoked by synchronous visual and tactile stimulation on a visible rubber arm and on the hidden real arm. Ownership is concurrent with a proprioceptive illusion of displacement of the arm position towards the fake arm. We have previously shown that this illusion of ownership plus the proprioceptive displacement also occurs towards a virtual 3D projection of an arm when the appropriate synchronous visuotactile stimulation is provided. Our objective here was to explore whether these illusions (ownership and proprioceptive displacement) can be induced by only synchronous visuomotor stimulation, in the absence of tactile stimulation. Methodology/Principal Findings To achieve this we used a data-glove that uses sensors transmitting the positions of fingers to a virtually projected hand in the synchronous but not in the asynchronous condition. The illusion of ownership was measured by means of questionnaires. Questions related to ownership gave significantly larger values for the synchronous than for the asynchronous condition. Proprioceptive displacement provided an objective measure of the illusion and had a median value of 3.5 cm difference between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. In addition, the correlation between the feeling of ownership of the virtual arm and the size of the drift was significant. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that synchrony between visual and proprioceptive information along with motor activity is able to induce an illusion of ownership over a virtual arm. This has implications regarding the brain mechanisms underlying body ownership as well as the use of virtual bodies in therapies and rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W1979592430,"To proliferate and expand in an environment with limited nutrients, cancer cells co-opt cellular regulatory pathways that facilitate adaptation and thereby maintain tumor growth and survival potential. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is uniquely positioned to sense nutrient deprivation stress and subsequently engage signaling pathways that promote adaptive strategies. As such, components of the ER stress-signaling pathway represent potential antineoplastic targets. However, recent investigations into the role of the ER resident protein kinase, RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) have paradoxically suggested both pro- and anti-tumorigenic properties. We have used animal models of mammary carcinoma to interrogate the contribution of PERK in the neoplastic process. The ablation of PERK in tumor cells resulted in impaired regeneration of intracellular antioxidants and accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggering oxidative DNA damage. Ultimately, PERK deficiency impeded progression through the cell cycle because of the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. Our data reveal that PERK-dependent signaling is used during both tumor initiation and expansion to maintain redox homeostasis, thereby facilitating tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W1997715976,"In the developing CNS, asymmetric cell division is critical for maintaining the balanced production of differentiating neurons while renewing the population of neural progenitors. In invertebrates, this process depends on asymmetric inheritance of fate determinants during progenitor divisions. A similar mechanism is widely believed to underlie asymmetrically fated divisions in vertebrates, but compelling evidence for this is missing. We used live imaging of individual progenitors in the intact zebrafish embryo CNS to test this hypothesis. We found that asymmetric inheritance of a subcellular domain is strongly correlated with asymmetric daughter fates and our results reveal an unexpected feature of this process. The daughter cell destined to become a neuron was derived from the more apical of the two daughters, whereas the more basal daughter inherited the basal process and replenished the apical progenitor pool."
https://openalex.org/W2053083062,"Background Climate change is already affecting the distributions of many species and may lead to numerous extinctions over the next century. Small-range species are likely to be a special concern, but the extent to which they are sensitive to climate is currently unclear. Species distribution modeling, if carefully implemented, can be used to assess climate sensitivity and potential climate change impacts, even for rare and cryptic species. Methodology/Principal Findings We used species distribution modeling to assess the climate sensitivity, climate change risks and conservation implications for a threatened small-range mammal species, the Iberian desman (Galemys pyrenaicus), which is a phylogenetically isolated insectivore endemic to south-western Europe. Atlas data on the distribution of G. pyrenaicus was linked to data on climate, topography and human impact using two species distribution modeling algorithms to test hypotheses on the factors that determine the range for this species. Predictive models were developed and projected onto climate scenarios for 2070–2099 to assess climate change risks and conservation possibilities. Mean summer temperature and water balance appeared to be the main factors influencing the distribution of G. pyrenaicus. Climate change was predicted to result in significant reductions of the species' range. However, the severity of these reductions was highly dependent on which predictor was the most important limiting factor. Notably, if mean summer temperature is the main range determinant, G. pyrenaicus is at risk of near total extinction in Spain under the most severe climate change scenario. The range projections for Europe indicate that assisted migration may be a possible long-term conservation strategy for G. pyrenaicus in the face of global warming. Conclusions/Significance Climate change clearly poses a severe threat to this illustrative endemic species. Our findings confirm that endemic species can be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and highlight the fact that assisted migration has potential as a conservation strategy for species threatened by climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2119974419,"Background A bacterial role in the obesity pandemic has been suspected based on the ingestion of probiotics that can modify the gut flora. The objective of our study was to determine if increased Lactobacillus sp. in the gut flora of newborn broiler chicks and ducks could result in weight gain increase. Methodology Female broiler chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) were separated into one control and two experimental groups, and inoculated once or twice with 4×1010 Lactobacillus spp. per animal in PBS, or with PBS alone. Fecal samples were collected before and at 24 hours, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 30 days after the inoculation. DNA was extracted from the stools, and qPCR assays were performed on a MX3000™ system for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus sp., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, using a quantification plasmid. Animals were measured and sacrificed 60 days after the beginning of the experiment, and livers were collected and measured. Principal Findings Chicks inoculated once and twice with Lactobacillus weighed 10.2% (p = 0.0162) and 13.5% (p = 0.0064) more than the control group animals, respectively. Similarly, ducks inoculated once and twice weighed 7.7% (p = 0.05) and 14% (p = 0.035) more than those in the control group, respectively. Liver mass was also significantly higher in inoculated animals compared to the control group. Inoculation with Lactobacillus sp. increased the DNA copies of Lactobacillus spp. and Firmicutes in the stools. Bacteroidetes remained stable, and only the second Lactobacillus sp. inoculation significantly decreased its population in chicks. The ratio of DNA copies of Firmicutes to those of Bacteroidetes increased to as much as 6,4 in chicks and 8,3 in ducks. Conclusions Differences in the intestinal microbiota may precede weight increase, as we found that an increase of Lactobacillus sp. in newborn ducks and chicks preceded the development of weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W2001655772,"Coral-associated bacteria are increasingly considered to be important in coral health, and altered bacterial community structures have been linked to both coral disease and bleaching. Despite this, assessments of bacterial communities on corals rarely apply sufficient replication to adequately describe the natural variability. Replicated data such as these are crucial in determining potential roles of bacteria on coral.Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of the V3 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA was used in a highly replicated approach to analyse bacterial communities on both healthy and diseased corals. Although site-specific variations in the bacterial communities of healthy corals were present, host species-specific bacterial associates within a distinct cluster of gamma-proteobacteria could be identified, which are potentially linked to coral health. Corals affected by ""White Syndrome"" (WS) underwent pronounced changes in their bacterial communities in comparison to healthy colonies. However, the community structure and bacterial ribotypes identified in diseased corals did not support the previously suggested theory of a bacterial pathogen as the causative agent of the syndrome.This is the first study to employ large numbers of replicated samples to assess the bacterial communities of healthy and diseased corals, and the first culture-independent assessment of bacterial communities on WS affected Acroporid corals on the GBR. Results indicate that a minimum of 6 replicate samples are required in order to draw inferences on species, spatial or health-related changes in community composition, as a set of clearly distinct bacterial community profiles exist in healthy corals. Coral bacterial communities may be both site and species specific. Furthermore, a cluster of gamma-proteobacterial ribotypes may represent a group of specific common coral and marine invertebrate associates. Finally, the results did not support the contention that a single bacterial pathogen may be the causative agent of WS Acroporids on the GBR."
https://openalex.org/W2042850301,"Wnt signaling is a critical regulatory pathway in development and disease. Very little is known about the mechanisms of Wnt signaling in prostate cancer, a leading cause of death in men. A quantitative analysis of the expression of Wnt5A protein in human tissue arrays, containing 600 prostate tissue cores, showed >50% increase in malignant compared to benign cores (p<0.0001). In a matched pair of prostate cancer and normal cell line, expression of Wnt5A protein was also increased. Calcium waves were induced in prostate cells in response to Wnt5A with a 3 fold increase in Flou-4 intensity. The activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), a transducer of the non-canonical Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling, increased by 8 fold in cancer cells; no change was observed in beta-catenin expression, known to activate the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Mining of publicly available human prostate cancer oligoarray datasets revealed that the expression of numerous genes (e.g., CCND1, CD44) under the control of beta-catenin transcription is down-regulated. Confocal and quantitative electron microscopy showed that specific inhibition of CaMKII in cancer cells causes remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, irregular wound edges and loose intercellular architecture and a 6 and 8 fold increase in the frequency and length of filopodia, respectively. Conversely, untreated normal prostate cells showed an irregular wound edge and loose intercellular architecture; incubation of normal prostate cells with recombinant Wnt5A protein induced actin remodeling with a regular wound edge and increased wound healing capacity. Live cell imaging showed that a functional consequence of CaMKII inhibition was 80% decrease in wound healing capacity and reduced cell motility in cancer cells. We propose that non-canonical Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling via CaMKII acts as a novel regulator of structural plasticity and cell motility in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1988187251,"Saframycin A is a potent antitumor antibiotic with a unique pentacyclic tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold. We found that the nonribosomal peptide synthetase SfmC catalyzes a seven-step transformation of readily synthesized dipeptidyl substrates with long acyl chains into a complex saframycin scaffold. Based on a series of enzymatic reactions, we propose a detailed mechanism involving the reduction of various peptidyl thioesters by a single R domain followed by iterative C domain-mediated Pictet-Spengler reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1972277010,"Altering intracellular calcium levels is known to partially restore mutant enzyme homeostasis in several lysosomal storage diseases, but why? We hypothesized that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium increases enhance the folding, trafficking and function of these mutant misfolding- and degradation-prone lysosomal enzymes by increasing chaperone function. Here we report that increasing ER calcium levels by reducing ER calcium efflux through the ryanodine receptor, using antagonists or RNAi, or by promoting ER calcium influx by SERCA2b overexpression enhances mutant glucocerebrosidase (GC) homeostasis in cells derived from individuals with Gaucher's disease. Post-translational regulation of the calnexin folding pathway by an elevated ER calcium concentration seems to enhance the capacity of this chaperone system to fold mutant misfolding-prone enzymes, increasing the folded mutant GC population that can engage the trafficking receptor at the expense of ER-associated degradation, increasing the lysosomal GC concentration and activity."
https://openalex.org/W1974326103,"In mice, social odors activate vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs); a large percentage of VSNs detect sulfated steroids. Here, the authors find that information about these molecules is conveyed through just a few sensory 'processing streams'. Downstream responses of accessory olfactory bulb neurons suggest distinct integratory roles: most relay a VSN pattern, although a substantial minority integrate across processing streams. In mice, nonvolatile social cues are detected and analyzed by the accessory olfactory system (AOS). Here we provide a first view of information processing in the AOS with respect to individual chemical cues. 12 sulfated steroids, recently discovered mouse AOS ligands, caused widespread activity among vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs), yet VSN responses clustered into a small number of repeated functional patterns or processing streams. Downstream neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) responded to these ligands with enhanced signal/noise compared to VSNs. Although the dendritic connectivity of AOB mitral cells suggests the capacity for broad integration, most sulfated steroid responses were well-modeled by linear excitatory drive from just one VSN processing stream. However, a substantial minority demonstrated multi-stream integration. Most VSN excitation patterns were also observed in the AOB, but excitation by estradiol sulfate processing streams was rare, suggesting AOB circuit organization is specific to the biological relevance of sensed cues."
https://openalex.org/W2021910662,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) signalling pathway is essential for metabolism, cell growth and survival. It induces expression of the mitochondrial pyrimidine nucleotide carrier 1 (PNC1) in transformed cells, but the consequences of this for cell phenotype are unknown. Here we show that PNC1 is necessary to maintain mitochondrial function by controlling mitochondrial DNA replication and the ratio of transcription of mitochondrial genes relative to nuclear genes. PNC1 suppression causes reduced oxidative phosphorylation and leakage of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activates the AMPK-PGC1α signalling pathway and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. Overexpression of PNC1 suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis. Suppression of PNC1 causes a profound ROS-dependent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas overexpression of PNC1 suppresses both basal EMT and induction of EMT by TGF-β. Overall, our findings indicate that PNC1 is essential for mitochondria maintenance and suggest that its induction by IGF-I facilitates cell growth whereas protecting cells from an ROS-promoted differentiation programme that arises from mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1975023995,"The authors report that the type 5 G protein beta subunit forms a complex with the protein RGS7 and that these complexes regulate the coupling of G protein–gated potassium channels to GABAB receptors in neurons. The type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5) can form complexes with members of the regulator of G protein signaling 7 (RGS7) family, but its relevance to neuronal G protein signaling is unclear. We found that mouse RGS7-Gβ5 complexes bound to G protein–gated potassium channels and facilitated their functional coupling to GABAB receptors in neurons. Our findings identify a compartmentalization mechanism that is critical for ensuring high temporal resolution of neuronal G protein signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2028596545,"Background Inhibition of macrophage apoptosis by Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been proposed as one of the virulence mechanisms whereby the pathogen avoids the host defense. The mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain suppress apoptosis and escapes human macrophage killing was investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings The screening of a transposon mutant bank identified several mutants, which, in contrast to the wild-type bacterium, had impaired ability to inhibit apoptosis of macrophages. Among the identified genes, Rv3659c (31G12 mutant) belongs to an operon reminiscent of type IV pili. The Rv3654c and Rv3655c putative proteins in a seven-gene operon are secreted into the macrophage cytoplasm and suppress apoptosis by blocking the extrinsic pathway. The operon is highly expressed when the bacterium is within macrophages, compared to the expression level in the extracellular environment. Rv3654c recognizes the polypyrimidine tract binding Protein-associated Splicing Factor (PSF) and cleaves it, diminishing the availability of caspase-8. While M. tuberculosis inhibits apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway, the pathogen does not appear to affect the intrinsic pathway. Inactivation of the intrinsic pathway by pharmacologic agents afftects M. tuberculosis and induces cell necrosis. Likewise, inactivation of PSF by siRNA significantly decreased the level of caspase-8 in macrophages. Conclusion While M. tuberculosis inhibits the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, it appears to activate the intrinsic pathway leading to macrophage necrosis as a potential exit strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2077157529,"Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) results in different clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic containment to rapidly progressing tuberculosis (TB). The mechanisms controlling TB progression in immunologically-competent hosts remain unclear.To address these mechanisms, we analyzed TB progression in a panel of genetically heterogeneous (A/SnxI/St) F2 mice, originating from TB-highly-susceptible I/St and more resistant A/Sn mice. In F2 mice the rates of TB progression differed. In mice that did not reach terminal stage of infection, TB progression did not correlate with lung Mtb loads. Nor was TB progression correlated with lung expression of factors involved in antibacterial immunity, such as iNOS, IFN-gamma, or IL-12p40. The major characteristics of progressing TB was high lung expression of the inflammation-related factors IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-11 (p<0.0003); CCL3, CCL4, CXCL2 (p<0.002); MMP-8 (p<0.0001). The major predictors of TB progression were high expressions of IL-1beta and IL-11. TNF-alpha had both protective and harmful effects. Factors associated with TB progression were expressed mainly by macrophages (F4-80(+) cells) and granulocytes (Gr-1(hi)/Ly-6G(hi) cells). Macrophages and granulocytes from I/St and A/Sn parental strains exhibited intrinsic differences in the expression of inflammatory factors, suggesting that genetically determined peculiarities of phagocytes transcriptional response could account for the peculiarities of gene expression in the infected lungs. Another characteristic feature of progressing TB was the accumulation in the infected lungs of Gr-1(dim) cells that could contribute to TB progression.In a population of immunocompetent hosts, the outcome of TB depends on quantitatively- and genetically-controlled differences in the intensity of inflammatory responses, rather than being a direct consequence of mycobacterial colonization. Local accumulation of Gr-1(dim) cells is a newly identified feature of progressing TB. High expression of IL-1beta and IL-11 are potential risk factors for TB progression and possible targets for TB immunomodulation."
https://openalex.org/W2043542071,"Background Tobacco smokers are more susceptible to periodontitis than non-smokers but exhibit reduced signs of clinical inflammation. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. We have previously shown that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) represents an environmental stress to which P. gingivalis adapts by altering the expression of several virulence factors – including major and minor fimbrial antigens (FimA and Mfa1, respectively) and capsule – concomitant with a reduced pro-inflammatory potential of intact P. gingivalis. Methodology/Principal Findings We hypothesized that CSE-regulation of capsule and fimbrial genes is reflected at the ultrastructural and functional levels, alters the nature of host-pathogen interactions, and contributes to the reduced pro- inflammatory potential of smoke exposed P. gingivalis. CSE induced ultrastructural alterations were determined by electron microscopy, confirmed by Western blot and physiological consequences studied in open-flow biofilms. Inflammatory profiling of specific CSE-dysregulated proteins, rFimA and rMfa1, was determined by quantifying cytokine induction in primary human innate and OBA-9 cells. CSE up-regulates P. gingivalis FimA at the protein level, suppresses the production of capsular polysaccharides at the ultrastructural level, and creates conditions that promote biofilm formation. We further show that while FimA is recognized by TLR2/6, it has only minimal inflammatory activity in several cell types. Furthermore, FimA stimulation chronically abrogates the pro-inflammatory response to subsequent TLR2 stimulation by other TLR-2-specific agonists (Pam3CSK4, FSL, Mfa1) in an IκBα- and IRAK-1-dependent manner. Conclusions/Significance These studies provide some of the first information to explain, mechanistically, how tobacco smoke changes the P. gingivalis phenotype in a manner likely to promote P. gingivalis colonization and infection while simultaneously reducing the host response to this major mucosal pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2068654543,"Background To report on the trend in all-cause mortality in a rural district of Malawi that has successfully scaled-up HIV/AIDS care including antiretroviral treatment (ART) to its population, through corroborative evidence from a) registered deaths at traditional authorities (TAs), b) coffin sales and c) church funerals. Methods and Findings Retrospective study in 5 of 12 TAs (covering approximately 50% of the population) during the period 2000–2007. A total of 210 villages, 24 coffin workshops and 23 churches were included. There were a total of 18,473 registered deaths at TAs, 15781 coffins sold, and 2762 church funerals. Between 2000 and 2007, there was a highly significant linear downward trend in death rates, sale of coffins and church funerals (X2 for linear trend: 338.4 P<0.0001, 989 P<0.0001 and 197, P<0.0001 respectively). Using data from TAs as the most reliable source of data on deaths, overall death rate reduction was 37% (95% CI:33–40) for the period. The mean annual incremental death rate reduction was 0.52/1000/year. Death rates decreased over time as the percentage of people living with HIV/AIDS enrolled into care and ART increased. Extrapolating these data to the entire district population, an estimated 10,156 (95% CI: 9786–10259) deaths would have been averted during the 8-year period. Conclusions Registered deaths at traditional authorities, the sale of coffins and church funerals showed a significant downward trend over a 8-year period which we believe was associated with the scaling up HIV/AIDS care and ART."
https://openalex.org/W2120994878,"Female germ cells are essential for organogenesis of the ovary; without them, ovarian follicles do not form and functional and structural characteristics of the ovary are lost. We and others showed previously that when either Wnt4 or β-catenin was inactivated in the fetal ovary, female germ cells underwent degeneration. In this study, we set out to understand whether these two factors belong to the same pathway and how they maintain female germ cell survival. We found that activation of β-catenin in somatic cells in the Wnt4 knockout ovary restored germ cell numbers, placing β-catenin downstream of WNT4. In the absence of Wnt4 or β-catenin, female germ cells entered meiosis properly; however, they underwent apoptosis afterwards. Activin βB (Inhbb), a subunit of activins, was upregulated in the Wnt4 and β-catenin knockout ovaries, suggesting that Inhbb could be the cause for the loss of female germ cells, which are positive for activin receptors. Indeed, removal of Inhbb in the Wnt4 knockout ovaries prevented female germ cells from undergoing degeneration. We conclude that WNT4 maintains female germ cell survival by inhibiting Inhbb expression via β-catenin in the somatic cells. Maintenance of female germ cells hinge upon a delicate balance between positive (WNT4 and β-catenin) and negative (activin βB) regulators derived from the somatic cells in the fetal ovary."
https://openalex.org/W2067773703,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been known for a long time to play important roles in host defense against microbial infections. In addition, it has become apparent that they also perform regulatory roles in signal transduction and cell proliferation. The source of these chemicals are members of the NOX family of NADPH oxidases that are found in a variety of tissues. NOX1, an NADPH oxidase homologue that is most abundantly expressed in colon epithelial cells, requires the regulatory subunits NOXO1 (NOX organizing protein 1) and NOXA1 (NOX activating protein 1), as well as the flavocytochrome component p22phox for maximal activity. Unlike NOX2, the phagocytic NADPH oxidase whose activity is tightly repressed in the resting state, NOX1 produces superoxide constitutively at low levels. These levels can be further increased in a stimulus-dependent manner, yet the molecular details regulating this activity are not fully understood. Here we present the first quantitative characterization of the interactions made between the cytosolic regulators NOXO1 and NOXA1 and membrane-bound p22phox. Using isothermal titration calorimetry we show that the isolated tandem SH3 domains of NOXO1 bind to p22phox with high affinity, most likely adopting a superSH3 domain conformation. In contrast, complex formation is severely inhibited in the presence of the C-terminal tail of NOXO1, suggesting that this region competes for binding to p22phox and thereby contributes to the regulation of superoxide production. Furthermore, we provide data indicating that the molecular details of the interaction between NOXO1 and NOXA1 is significantly different from that between the homologous proteins of the phagocytic oxidase, suggesting that there are important functional differences between the two systems. Taken together, this study provides clear evidence that the assembly of the NOX1 oxidase complex can be regulated through reversible protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1973994873,"Background Recent studies demonstrated an association of STAT4 variants with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), indicating that multiple autoimmune diseases share common susceptibility genes. We therefore investigated the influence of STAT4 variants on the susceptibility and phenotype of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in a large patient and control cohort. Methodology/Principal Findings Genomic DNA from 2704 individuals of Caucasian origin including 857 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 464 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 1383 healthy, unrelated controls was analyzed for seven SNPs in the STAT4 gene (rs11889341, rs7574865, rs7568275, rs8179673, rs10181656, rs7582694, rs10174238). In addition, a detailed genotype-phenotype analysis was performed. Our analysis revealed an association of the STAT4 SNP rs7574865 with overall decreased susceptibility to CD (p = 0.047, OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74–0.99]). However, compared to CD patients carrying the wild type genotype, the STAT4 SNP rs7574865 was significantly associated with early CD onset (p = 0.021) and colonic CD (p = 0.008; OR = 4.60, 95% CI 1.63–12.96). For two other STAT4 variants, there was a trend towards protection against CD susceptibility (rs7568275, p = 0.058, OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74–1.00]; rs10174238, p = 0.057, OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75–1.00]). In contrast, we did not observe any association with UC susceptibility. Evidence for weak gene-gene interaction of STAT4 with the IL23R SNP rs11209026 was lost after Bonferroni correction. Conclusions/Significance Our results identified the STAT4 SNP rs7574865 as a disease-modifying gene variant in colonic CD. However, in contrast to SLE and RA, the effect of rs7574865 on CD susceptibility is only weak."
https://openalex.org/W2003237927,"A leading candidate in the process of memory formation is hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a persistent enhancement in synaptic strength evoked by the repetitive activation of excitatory synapses, either by experimental high-frequency stimulation (HFS) or, as recently shown, during actual learning. But are the molecular mechanisms for maintaining synaptic potentiation induced by HFS and by experience the same? Protein kinase Mzeta (PKMzeta), an autonomously active atypical protein kinase C isoform, plays a key role in the maintenance of LTP induced by tetanic stimulation and the storage of long-term memory. To test whether the persistent action of PKMzeta is necessary for the maintenance of synaptic potentiation induced after learning, the effects of ZIP (zeta inhibitory peptide), a PKMzeta inhibitor, on eyeblink-conditioned mice were studied. PKMzeta inhibition in the hippocampus disrupted both the correct retrieval of conditioned responses (CRs) and the experience-dependent persistent increase in synaptic strength observed at CA3-CA1 synapses. In addition, the effects of ZIP on the same associative test were examined when tetanic LTP was induced at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse before conditioning. In this case, PKMzeta inhibition both reversed tetanic LTP and prevented the expected LTP-mediated deleterious effects on eyeblink conditioning. Thus, PKMzeta inhibition in the CA1 area is able to reverse both the expression of trace eyeblink conditioned memories and the underlying changes in CA3-CA1 synaptic strength, as well as the anterograde effects of LTP on associative learning."
https://openalex.org/W1984000380,"HER2/neu (HER2) and cyclin E are important prognostic indicators in breast cancer. As both are involved in cell cycle regulation we analyzed whether there was a direct interaction between the two. HER2 and cyclin E expression levels were determined in 395 breast cancer patients. Patients with HER2-overexpression and high levels of cyclin E had decreased 5-year disease-specific survival compared with low levels of cyclin E (14% versus 89%, P<0.0001). In vitro studies were performed in which HER2-mediated activity in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines was downregulated by transfection with HER2 small interfering RNA or treatment with trastuzumab. Cyclin E expression levels were determined by western blot analysis, and functional effects analyzed using kinase assays, MTT assays were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was used to determine cell cycle profiles. Decreased HER2-mediated signaling resulted in decreased expression of cyclin E, particularly the low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms. Decreased HER2 and LMW cyclin E expression had functional consequences, including decreased cyclin E-associated kinase activity and decreased proliferation, because of increased apoptosis and an increased accumulation of cells in the G1 phase. In vivo studies performed in a HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenograft model confirmed the effects of trastuzumab on cyclin E expression. Given the relationship between HER2 and cyclin E, in vitro clonogenic assays were performed to assess combination therapy targeting both proteins. Isobologram analysis showed a synergistic interaction between the two agents (trastuzumab targeting HER2 and roscovitine targeting cyclin E). Taken together, these studies show that HER2-mediated signaling effects LMW cyclin E expression, which in turn deregulates the cell cycle. LMW cyclin E has prognostic and predictive roles in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, warranting further study of its potential as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2020771731,"Background Titania dioxide (TiO2) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. Visible-light responsive anion-doped TiO2 photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. The antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. Methodology/Principal Findings Using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated TiO2 thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. Among our tested titania substrates including TiO2, carbon-doped TiO2 [TiO2 (C)] and nitrogen-doped TiO2 [TiO2 (N)], TiO2 (N) showed the best performance after silver coating. The synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on TiO2 (N) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. Conclusion/Significance Our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could further influence the bactericidal property."
https://openalex.org/W2125894151,"Background Among healthcare workers in developing countries, nurses spend a large amount of time in direct contact with tuberculosis (TB) patients, and are at high risk for acquisition of TB infection and disease. To better understand the epidemiology of nosocomial TB among nurses, we recruited a cohort of young nursing trainees at Christian Medical College, a large, tertiary medical school hospital in Southern India. Methodology/Principal Findings Among 535 nursing students enrolled in 2007, 468 gave consent to participate, and 436 underwent two-step tuberculin skin testing (TST). A majority (95%) were females, and almost 80% were under 22 years of age. Detailed TB exposure information was obtained using interviews and clinical log books. Prevalence of latent TB infection (LTBI) was estimated using Bayesian latent class analyses (LCA). Logistic regression analyses were done to determine the association between LTBI prevalence and TB exposure and risk factors. 219 of 436 students (50.2%, 95% CI: 45.4–55.0) were TST positive using the 10 mm or greater cut-off. Based on the LCA, the prevalence of LTBI was 47.8% (95% credible interval 17.8% to 65.6%). In the multivariate analysis, TST positivity was strongly associated with time spent in health care, after adjusting for age at entry into healthcare. Conclusions Our study showed a high prevalence of LTBI even in young nursing trainees. With the recent TB infection control (TBIC) policy guidance from the World Health Organization as the reference, Indian healthcare providers and the Indian Revised National TB Control Programme will need to implement TBIC interventions, and enhance capacity for TBIC at the country level. Young trainees and nurses, in particular, will need to be targeted for TBIC interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2091589316,"Altered expression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) subunit eIF3e/INT6 has been described in various types of human cancer, but the nature of its involvement in tumorigenesis is not yet clear. Using immunohistochemical analysis of 81 primary breast cancers, we found that high tumor grade correlated significantly with elevated cytoplasmic eIF3e level in epithelial tumor cells. Analysis of protein synthesis after siRNA-mediated knockdown in breast cancer cell lines indicated that eIF3e is not required for bulk translation. Microarray analysis of total and polysomal RNAs nonetheless identified distinct sets of mRNAs regulated either positively or negatively by eIF3e; functional classification of these revealed a marked enrichment of genes involved in cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis. Validated mRNA targets regulated positively at the translational level by eIF3e included urokinase-type plasminogen activator and apoptotic regulator BCL-XL, whereas synthesis of proteins including the mitotic checkpoint component MAD2L1 was negatively regulated. Finally, eIF3e-depleted breast carcinoma cells showed reduced in vitro invasion and proliferation. Taken together, our study data suggest that eIF3e has a positive role in breast cancer progression. It regulates the translation, and in some cases abundance, of mRNAs involved in key aspects of cancer cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2011177831,"The adaptor protein p140Cap/SNIP is a novel Src-binding protein that regulates Src activation through C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). Here, by gain and loss of function approaches in breast and colon cancer cells, we report that p140Cap immobilizes E-cadherin at the cell membrane and inhibits EGFR and Erk1/2 signalling, blocking scatter and proliferation of cancer cells. p140Cap-dependent regulation of E-cadherin/EGFR cross-talk and cell motility is due to the inhibition of Src kinase. However, rescue of Src activity is not sufficient to restore Erk1/2 phosphorylation and proliferation. Indeed, p140Cap also impairs Erk1/2 phosphorylation by affecting Ras activity, downstream to the EGFR. In conclusion, p140Cap stabilizes adherens junctions and inhibits EGFR and Ras signalling through the dual control of both Src and Ras activities, thus affecting crucial cancer properties such as invasion and growth. Interestingly, p140Cap expression is lost in more aggressive human breast cancers, showing an inverse correlation with EGFR expression. Therefore, p140Cap mechanistically behaves as a tumour suppressor that inhibits signalling pathways leading to aggressive phenotypes."

Despite the crucial role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in anti-tumor responses, their therapeutic potential has not yet been worked out. We explored the relevance of HLA-A*0201 matched allogeneic pDCs as vectors for immunotherapy.Stimulation of PBMC from HLA-A*0201(+) donors by HLA-A*0201 matched allogeneic pDCs pulsed with tumor-derived peptides triggered high levels of antigen-specific and functional cytotoxic T cell responses (up to 98% tetramer(+) CD8 T cells). The pDC vaccine demonstrated strong anti-tumor therapeutic in vivo efficacy as shown by the inhibition of tumor growth in a humanized mouse model. It also elicited highly functional tumor-specific T cells ex-vivo from PBMC and TIL of stage I-IV melanoma patients. Responses against MelA, GP100, tyrosinase and MAGE-3 antigens reached tetramer levels up to 62%, 24%, 85% and 4.3% respectively. pDC vaccine-primed T cells specifically killed patients' own autologous melanoma tumor cells. This semi-allogeneic pDC vaccine was more effective than conventional myeloid DC-based vaccines. Furthermore, the pDC vaccine design endows it with a strong potential for clinical application in cancer treatment.These findings highlight HLA-A*0201 matched allogeneic pDCs as potent inducers of tumor immunity and provide a promising immunotherapeutic strategy to fight cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2001655575,"Beclin 1 plays an essential role in autophagy; however, the regulation of Beclin 1 expression remains largely unexplored. An earlier ChIP-on-chip study suggested Beclin 1 could be an E2F target. Previously, we also reported that 14-3-3tau regulates E2F1 stability, and is required for the expression of several E2F1 target genes. 14-3-3 proteins mediate many cellular signaling processes, but its role in autophagy has not been investigated. We hypothesize that 14-3-3tau could regulate Beclin 1 expression through E2F1 and thus regulate autophagy.Using the RNAi technique we demonstrate a novel role for one of 14-3-3 isoforms, 14-3-3tau, in the regulation of Beclin 1 expression and autophagy. Depletion of 14-3-3tau inhibits the expression of Beclin 1 in many different cell lines; whereas, upregulation of 14-3-3tau induces Beclin 1. The regulation is physiologically relevant as an extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C, a known 14-3-3tau inducer, can induce Beclin 1 through 14-3-3tau. Moreover, rapamycin-induced, serum free-induced and amino acid starvation-induced autophagy depends on 14-3-3tau. We also show the expression of Beclin 1 depends on E2F, and E2F can transactivate the Beclin 1 promoter in a promoter reporter assay. Upregulation of Beclin 1 by 14-3-3tau requires E2F1. Depletion of E2F1, like 14-3-3tau, also inhibits autophagy.Taken together, this study uncovers a role for 14-3-3tau in Beclin 1 and autophagy regulation probably through regulation of E2F1."
https://openalex.org/W2119343648,"Background Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and are used clinically to help restore peripheral insulin sensitivity in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Interestingly, long-term treatment of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with TZDs also has been shown to reduce several well-established brain biomarkers of AD including inflammation, oxidative stress and Aβ accumulation. While TZD's actions in AD models help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their potentially beneficial effects in AD patients, little is known about the functional consequences of TZDs in animal models of normal aging. Because aging is a common risk factor for both AD and T2DM, we investigated whether the TZD, pioglitazone could alter brain aging under non-pathological conditions. Methods and Findings We used the F344 rat model of aging, and monitored behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular variables to assess the effects of pioglitazone (PIO-Actos® a TZD) on several peripheral (blood and liver) and central (hippocampal) biomarkers of aging. Starting at 3 months or 17 months of age, male rats were treated for 4–5 months with either a control or a PIO-containing diet (final dose approximately 2.3 mg/kg body weight/day). A significant reduction in the Ca2+-dependent afterhyperpolarization was seen in the aged animals, with no significant change in long-term potentiation maintenance or learning and memory performance. Blood insulin levels were unchanged with age, but significantly reduced by PIO. Finally, a combination of microarray analyses on hippocampal tissue and serum-based multiplex cytokine assays revealed that age-dependent inflammatory increases were not reversed by PIO. Conclusions While current research efforts continue to identify the underlying processes responsible for the progressive decline in cognitive function seen during normal aging, available medical treatments are still very limited. Because TZDs have been shown to have benefits in age-related conditions such as T2DM and AD, our study was aimed at elucidating PIO's potentially beneficial actions in normal aging. Using a clinically-relevant dose and delivery method, long-term PIO treatment was able to blunt several indices of aging but apparently affected neither age-related cognitive decline nor peripheral/central age-related increases in inflammatory signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1986363458,"Protein distribution profiles along the human intestinal tract of transporters involved in the absorption of cholesterol and long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) have been scarcely evaluated.In post-mortem samples from 11 subjects, intestinal transporter distribution profiles were determined via Western Blot. Differences in transporter protein levels were statistically tested using ANOVA and Tukey's Post Hoc comparisons. Levels in all segments were expressed relative to those in duodenum. Except for ABCG5 and FATP4, levels (mean+/-SEM) were the highest in the ileum. For ABCA1, ileal levels (1.80+/-0.26) differed significantly from those in duodenum (P = 0.049) and proximal colon (0.92+/-0.14; P = 0.029). ABCG8 levels in ileum (1.91+/-0.30) differed from those in duodenum (P = 0.041) and distal colon (0.84+/-0.22; P = 0.010) and jejunum (1.64+/-0.26) tended to be higher than distal colon (0.84+/-0.22; P = 0.087). Ileal NPC1L1 levels (2.56+/-0.51) differed from duodenum levels (P = 0.019) and from distal colon (1.09+/-0.22; P = 0.030). There was also a trend (P = 0.098) for higher jejunal (2.23+/-0.37) than duodenal NPC1L1 levels. The levels of ABCG5 did not correlate with those of ABCG8. FAT/CD36 levels in ileum (2.03+/-0.42) differed from those in duodenum (P = 0.017), and proximal and distal colon (0.89+/-0.13 and 0.97+/-0.15 respectively; P = 0.011 and P = 0.014). FABPpm levels in ileum (1.04+/-0.13) differed from proximal (0.64+/-0.07; P = 0.026) and distal colon (0.66+/-0.09; P = 0.037).The distribution profiles showed a bell-shape pattern along the GI-tract with the highest levels in ileum for ABCA1, ABCG8, NPC1L1, FATCD36 and FABPm, suggesting a prominent role for ileum in transporter-mediated uptake of cholesterol and LCFAs."
https://openalex.org/W2141224575,"Background The ABC transporter OpuA from Lactococcus lactis transports glycine betaine upon activation by threshold values of ionic strength. In this study, the ligand binding characteristics of purified OpuA in a detergent-solubilized state and of its substrate-binding domain produced as soluble protein (OpuAC) was characterized. Principal Findings The binding of glycine betaine to purified OpuA and OpuAC (KD = 4–6 µM) did not show any salt dependence or cooperative effects, in contrast to the transport activity. OpuAC is highly specific for glycine betaine and the related proline betaine. Other compatible solutes like proline and carnitine bound with affinities that were 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower. The low affinity substrates were not noticeably transported by membrane-reconstituted OpuA. OpuAC was crystallized in an open (1.9 Å) and closed-liganded (2.3 Å) conformation. The binding pocket is formed by three tryptophans (Trp-prism) coordinating the quaternary ammonium group of glycine betaine in the closed-liganded structure. Even though the binding site of OpuAC is identical to that of its B. subtilis homolog, the affinity for glycine betaine is 4-fold higher. Conclusions Ionic strength did not affect substrate binding to OpuA, indicating that regulation of transport is not at the level of substrate binding, but rather at the level of translocation. The overlap between the crystal structures of OpuAC from L.lactis and B.subtilis, comprising the classical Trp-prism, show that the differences observed in the binding affinities originate from outside of the ligand binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1994561593,"Neuropathic pain is a highly debilitating chronic pain following damage to peripheral sensory neurons and is often resistant to all treatments currently available, including opioids. We have previously shown that peripheral nerve injury induces activation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) in injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that contribute to tactile allodynia, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. However, lipid mediators downstream of cPLA(2) activation to produce tactile allodynia remain to be determined.Here we provide evidence that platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potential candidate. Pharmacological blockade of PAF receptors (PAFRs) reduced the development and expression of tactile allodynia following nerve injury. The expression of PAFR mRNA was increased in the DRG ipsilateral to nerve injury, which was seen mainly in macrophages. Furthermore, mice lacking PAFRs showed a reduction of nerve injury-induced tactile allodynia and, interestingly, a marked suppression of upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression in the injured DRG, crucial proinflammatory cytokines involved in pain hypersensitivity. Conversely, a single injection of PAF near the DRG of naïve rats caused a decrease in the paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation in a dose-dependent manner and an increase in the expression of mRNAs for TNFalpha and IL-1beta, both of which were inhibited by pretreatment with a PAFR antagonist.Our results indicate that the PAF/PAFR system has an important role in production of TNFalpha and IL-1beta in the DRG and tactile allodynia following peripheral nerve injury and suggest that blocking PAFRs may be a viable therapeutic strategy for treating neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2090720448,"Oncogenes induce cell proliferation leading to replicative stress, DNA damage and genomic instability. A wide variety of cellular stresses activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins, but few studies have directly addressed the roles of JNK isoforms in tumor development. Herein, we show that jnk2 knockout mice expressing the Polyoma Middle T Antigen transgene developed mammary tumors earlier and experienced higher tumor multiplicity compared to jnk2 wildtype mice. Lack of jnk2 expression was associated with higher tumor aneuploidy and reduced DNA damage response, as marked by fewer pH2AX and 53BP1 nuclear foci. Comparative genomic hybridization further confirmed increased genomic instability in PyV MT/jnk2−/− tumors. In vitro, PyV MT/jnk2−/− cells underwent replicative stress and cell death as evidenced by lower BrdU incorporation, and sustained chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT1) and p21Waf1 protein expression, and phosphorylation of Chk1 after serum stimulation, but this response was not associated with phosphorylation of p53 Ser15. Adenoviral overexpression of CDT1 led to similar differences between jnk2 wildtype and knockout cells. In normal mammary cells undergoing UV induced single stranded DNA breaks, JNK2 localized to RPA (Replication Protein A) coated strands indicating that JNK2 responds early to single stranded DNA damage and is critical for subsequent recruitment of DNA repair proteins. Together, these data support that JNK2 prevents replicative stress by coordinating cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2076778057,"A number of drugs developed against cancer-specific molecular targets have been shown to offer survival benefits alone or in combination with standard treatments, especially for those cases in which tumor pathogenesis is dominated by a single molecular abnormality. One example for such a tumor type is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), which is characterized by a specific translocation creating the oncogenic PAX3/FKHR transcription factor, believed to be the molecular basis of the disease. Recently, we were able to show that the small molecule inhibitor PKC412 (midostaurin) shows strong antitumor activity against aRMS by reducing the transcriptional activity of PAX3/FKHR. In this study, we screened for combination strategies that are superior to PKC412-only treatment and found that the combination of PKC412 with histone deacetylase inhibitors like valproic acid (VPA) synergistically induced apoptosis resulting in suppressed aRMS tumor growth in vivo. We provide evidence that the antitumor effect on combination treatment is achieved by VPA-induced reactivation of p21, which is downregulated in aRMS cells by destabilization of the transcriptional regulator EGR1 by PAX3/FKHR. Our study highlights a possible mechanism behind the increased efficacy and indicates that different arms of PAX3/FKHR oncogenicity can be exploited therapeutically by the specific combination of drugs to increase their therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1993648268,"In this study, we identified posttranslational regulation of human telomerase reverse-transcriptase (hTERT) by the E3 ligase Hdm2. The telomerase activity generated by exogenous hTERT in U2OS cells was reduced on adriamycin treatment. The overexpressed levels of hTERT were also decreased under the same conditions. These processes were reversed by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor or depletion of Hdm2. Furthermore, intrinsic telomerase activity was increased in HCT116 cells with ablation of Hdm2. Immunoprecipitation analyses showed that hTERT and Hdm2 bound to each other in multiple domains. Ubiquitination analyses showed that Hdm2 could polyubiquitinate hTERT principally at the N-terminus, which was further degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. An hTERT mutant with all five lysine residues at the N-terminus of hTERT that mutated to arginine became resistant to Hdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. In U2OS cells, depletion of Hdm2 or addition of the Hdm2-resistant hTERT mutant strengthened the cellular protective effects against apoptosis. Similar results were obtained with the Hdm2-stable H1299 cell line. These observations indicate that Hdm2 is an E3 ligase of hTERT."
https://openalex.org/W2075852732,"We hypothesized that specific activation of a single retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα), without direct and concurrent activation of RARβ and γ, will inhibit mammary tumor oncogenesis in murine models relevant to human cancer. A total of 50 uniparous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-neu and 50 nuliparous MMTV-wnt1 transgenic mice were treated with RARα agonist (retinobenzoic acid, Am580) that was added to the diet for 40 (neu) and 35 weeks (wnt1), respectively. Among the shared antitumor effects was the inhibition of epithelial hyperplasia, a significant increase (P<0.05) in tumor-free survival and a reduction in tumor incidence and in the growth of established tumors. In both models, the mechanisms responsible for these effects involved inhibition of proliferation and survival pathways, and induction of apoptosis. The treatment was more effective in the MMTV-wnt1 model in which Am580 also induced differentiation, in both in vivo and three-dimensional (3D) cultures. In these tumors Am580 inhibited the wnt pathway, measured by loss of nuclear β-catenin, suggesting partial oncogene dependence of therapy. Am580 treatment increased RARβ and lowered the level of RARγ, an isotype whose expression we linked with tumor proliferation. The anticancer effect of RARα, together with the newly discovered pro-proliferative role of RARγ, suggests that specific activation of RARα and inhibition of RARγ might be effective in breast cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2023104080,"Ecological studies on food webs rarely include parasites, partly due to the complexity and dimensionality of host-parasite interaction networks. Multiple co-occurring parasites can show different feeding strategies and thus lead to complex and cryptic trophic relationships, which are often difficult to disentangle by traditional methods. We analyzed stable isotope ratios of C (13C/12C, δ13C) and N (15N/14N, δ15N) of host and ectoparasite tissues to investigate trophic structure in 4 co-occurring ectoparasites: three lice and one flea species, on two closely related and spatially segregated seabird hosts (Calonectris shearwaters). δ13C isotopic signatures confirmed feathers as the main food resource for the three lice species and blood for the flea species. All ectoparasite species showed a significant enrichment in δ15N relatively to the host tissue consumed (discrimination factors ranged from 2 to 5‰ depending on the species). Isotopic differences were consistent across multiple host-ectoparasite locations, despite of some geographic variability in baseline isotopic levels. Our findings illustrate the influence of both ectoparasite and host trophic ecology in the isotopic structuring of the Calonectris ectoparasite community. This study highlights the potential of stable isotope analyses in disentangling the nature and complexity of trophic relationships in symbiotic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2064260286,"The Abelson (Abl) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases has an important role in cell morphogenesis, motility, and proliferation. Although the function of Abl has been extensively studied in leukemia, its role in epithelial cell invasion remains obscure. Using the Drosophila wing epithelium as an in vivo model system, we show that overexpression (activation) of Drosophila Abl (dAbl) causes loss of epithelial apical/basal cell polarity and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in a cellular invasion and apoptosis. Our in vivo data indicate that dAbl acts downstream of the Src kinases, which are known regulators of cell adhesion and invasion. Downstream of dAbl, Rac GTPases activate two distinct MAPK pathways: c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling (required for cell invasion and apoptosis) and ERK signaling (inducing cell proliferation). Activated Abl also increases the activity of Src members through a positive feedback loop leading to signal amplification. Thus, targeting Src-Abl, using available dual inhibitors, could be of therapeutic importance in tumor cell metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2103205174,"Recently, we found that mutation of the C-terminus of transcription factor hexamethylene bisacetamide-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) in mice leads to abnormalities in cardiovascular development because of aberrant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. HEXIM1 regulation of some genes has also been shown to be positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) dependent. However, it is not known whether HEXIM1 regulates VEGF in the mammary gland. We demonstrate that HEXIM1 regulates estrogen-induced VEGF transcription through inhibition of estrogen receptor-alpha recruitment to the VEGF promoter in a P-TEFb-independent manner in MCF-7 cells. Under hypoxic conditions, HEXIM1 inhibits estrogen-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein expression and recruitment of HIF-1alpha to the hypoxia-response element in the VEGF promoter. In the mouse mammary gland, increased HEXIM1 expression decreased estrogen-driven VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression. Conversely, a mutation in the C-terminus of HEXIM1 (HEXIM1(1-312)) led to increased VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression and vascularization in mammary glands of heterozygous HEXIM1(1-312) mice when compared with their wild-type littermates. In addition, HEXIM1(1-312) mice have a higher incidence of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors with increased vascularization, suggesting an inhibitory role for HEXIM1 during angiogenesis. Taken together, our data provide evidence to suggest a novel role for HEXIM1 in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W4245949654,"The GTPase RhoA participates in a number of cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, mitogenesis and tumorigenesis. We have previously shown that the transforming activity of an oncogenic version of RhoA (Q63L mutant) was highly dependent on the transcriptional factor c-Myc. In contrast to these positive effects in the RhoA route, we show here that c-Myc affects negatively the F-actin cytoskeleton induced by RhoAQ63L and its downstream effector, the serine/threonine kinase Rock. This effect entails the activation of a transcriptional program that requires synergistic interactions with RhoA-derived signals and that includes the upregulation of the GTPase Cdc42 and its downstream element Pak1 as well as the repression of specific integrin subunits. The negative effects of c-Myc in the F-actin cytoskeleton are eliminated by the establishment of cell-to-cell contacts, an effect associated with the rescue of Pak1 and integrin levels at the post-transcriptional and transcriptional levels, respectively. These results reveal the presence of a hitherto unknown signaling feed-back loop between RhoA and c--Myc oncogenes that can contribute to maintain fluid cytoskeletal dynamics in cancer cells."

We assessed the effectiveness of these regimens from 6-10 weeks and 12 months of age, respectively.We conducted a retrospective cohort study covering the period from October 2004 to March 2008 in a reference hospital in Cameroon. HIV-positive pregnant women with CD4 < or = 350 cells/mm(3) received first-line HAART [regimen 1] while the others received ARV prophylaxis including sc-dARV or single dose nevirapine (sd-NVP). Sc-dARV included at least two drugs according to different gestational ages: zidovudine (ZDV) from 28-32 weeks plus sd-NVP [regimen 2], ZDV and lamuvidine (3TC) from 33-36 weeks plus sd-NVP [regimen 3]. When gestational age was > or = 37 weeks, women received sd-NVP during labour [regimen 4]. Infants received sd-NVP plus ZDV and 3TC for 7 days or 30 days. Early diagnosis (6-10 weeks) was done, using b-DNA and subsequently RT-PCR. We determined early MTCT rate and associated risk factors using logistic regression. The 12-month HIV-free survival was assessed using Cox regression. Among 418 mothers, 335 (80%) received multidrug ARV regimens (1, 2, and 3) and MTCT rate with multidrug regimens was 6.6% [95%CI: 4.3-9.6] at 6 weeks, without any significant difference between regimens. Duration of mother's ARV regimen < 4 weeks [OR = 4.7, 95%CI: 1.3-17.6], mother's CD4 < 350 cells/mm(3) [OR = 6.4, 95%CI: 1.8-22.5] and low birth weight [OR = 4.0, 95%CI: 1.4-11.3] were associated with early MTCT. By 12 months, mixed feeding [HR = 8.7, 95%CI: 3.6-20.6], prematurity [HR = 2.3, 95%CI: 1.2-4.3] and low birth weight were associated with children's risk of progressing to infection or death.Multidrug ARV regimens for PMTCT are feasible and effective in routine reference hospital. Early initiation of ARV during pregnancy and proper obstetrical care are essential to improve PMTCT."
https://openalex.org/W2007113321,"It has been documented that when memorizing a physical space, the person's mental representation of that space is biased with distortion and segmentation. Two experiments reported here suggest that distortion and segmentation arise due to a hierarchical organization of the spatial representation. The spatial relations associated with salient landmarks are more strongly encoded and easier to recall than those associated with non-salient landmarks. In the presence of multiple salient landmarks, multiple intrinsic frames of reference are formed and spatial relations are anchored to each individual frame of reference. Multiple such representations may co-exist and interactively determine a person's spatial performance."
https://openalex.org/W2032782761,"Recombination activating gene (RAG)-deficient TCR (T Cell Receptor) Tg (transgenic) mice are routinely used as sources of monoclonal T cells. We found that after the transfer of T cells from a RAG-2-deficient 5CC7 TCR Tg mice into allogeneic hosts we recovered a population of T cells expressing diverse αβ-TCRs. In fact, in the thymus and spleen of the 5CC7 RAG-2-deficient donor mice, we detected rare T cells expressing non-Tg TCR chains. Similar observations were obtained using T cells from two other TCR transgenic strains, namely RAG-2-deficient aHY and RAG-1-deficient OT-1 mice. The sequences of the endogenous TCR transcripts suggested that gene recombination could occur, albeit quite inefficiently, in the RAG-deficient mice we used. In agreement, we evidenced rare TCR Vα and Vβ-chain transcripts in non-Tg RAG-2-deficient mice. Since in these non-Tg RAG-deficient mice no mature T cells could ever be found, our findings suggested a role for the TCR Tg in rescuing rare recombined endogenous chains. Robust T-cell activation by the allogeneic environment favored the selection and expansion of the rare cells expressing endogenous TCRs. Potential mechanisms involved in the recombination of the endogenous TCR chains in the different strains of RAG-deficient mice used, and in particular the possibility of RAG-1 hypomorphism due to an incomplete knocking out procedure, are discussed. Our findings have important experimental implications for studies using TCR-Tg RAG-deficient cells as monoclonal T cell populations."

During dusk the transformation result in an increase of the refractive power in the lens cortex, the outermost 40 percent. The change is thought to match the optical properties of the lens to the requirements of the retina. Using a short term in vitro lens culturing system together with optical measurements we here present data that confirm that the optical properties of the lens can change within hours and that dopamine influences the optical properties of the lens. Dopamine yields dose-dependent decrease of the refractive power in the lens cortex. The D1-agonist SKF-38393 induces a similar decrease of the refractive power in the cortex, while the D2-agonist quinpirole has no effect. The effect of dopamine can be blocked by using the D1-antagonist SCH 23390. Our results suggest that dopamine alone could be responsible for the light/dark adaptive optical changes in the lens, but the involvement of other signaling substances cannot be ruled out."

https://openalex.org/W2068511825,"The Myc-deregulating chromosomal T(12;15)(Igh–Myc) translocation, the hallmark mutation of inflammation- and interleukin 6-dependent mouse plasmacytoma (PCT), is the premier model of cancer-associated chromosomal translocations because it is the only translocation in mice that occurs spontaneously (B lymphocyte lineage) and with predictably high incidence (∼85% of PCT), and has a direct counterpart in humans: Burkitt lymphoma t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation. Here, we report on the development of a genetic system for the detection of T(12;15)(Igh–Myc) translocations in plasma cells of a mouse strain in which an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding reporter gene has been targeted to Myc. Four of the PCTs that developed in the newly generated translocation reporter mice, designated iGFP5′Myc, expressed GFP consequent to naturally occurring T(12;15) translocation. GFP expression did not interfere with tumor development or the deregulation of Myc on derivative 12 of translocation, der (12), because the reporter gene was allocated to the reciprocal product of translocation, der (15). Although the described reporter gene approach requires refinement before T(12;15) translocations can be quantitatively detected in vivo, including in B lymphocyte lineage cells that have not yet completed malignant transformation, our findings provide proof of principle that reporter gene tagging of oncogenes in gene-targeted mice can be used to elucidate unresolved questions on the occurrence, distribution and trafficking of cells that have acquired cancer-causing chromosomal translocations of great relevance for humans."
