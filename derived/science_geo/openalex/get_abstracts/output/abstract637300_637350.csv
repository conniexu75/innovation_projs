https://openalex.org/W2966077288,"The intestinal microbiota of newborns plays an important role in the development of immunity and metabolism. In livestock animals, knowledge of the intestinal microbiota is essential not only to prevent diseases but also to optimize weight gain and performance. The aim of our study was to examine faecal samples repeatedly within the first two days of life using 16S rRNA gene High Throughput Sequencing. Additionally, samples from the mouths of the calves and the vaginas, colostrum, and faeces of the dams were included to evaluate possible sources of the calf faecal microbiota. The calf faecal microbiota was highly variable during the first 48 hours post natum (p.n.). Significant changes were found in species diversity and richness, in copy numbers evaluated by qPCR and in predominant bacteria over time. The most pronounced changes occurred between 6 and 24 hours p.n. All calf faecal samples were dominated by Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Cow faecal samples showed significantly higher species richness, diversity, number of observed OTUs, and copy numbers compared to all other samples. OTUs belonging to the family Ruminococcaceae were most abundant in cow faecal and vaginal samples. Colostrum was dominated by Enhydrobacter affiliated OTUs. To identify possible inoculation routes for the calf microbiota, we analysed OTU sharing between samples. The calf microbiota during the first two days of life was clearly distinct from the dam's faecal microbiota. Furthermore, colostrum microbiota clearly differed from calf and cow faecal microbiota and thus most likely does not play an important role as inoculation source for calf microbiota during the first two days of life. In contrast, the cow vaginal and the calf faecal microbiota were more similar, suggesting that some of the calf faecal microbiota may derive from inoculation from the birth canal during birth."
https://openalex.org/W2964637462,"Human adenovirus (HAdV) is known to be a common cause of diarrhea in children worldwide. Infection with adenovirus is responsible for 2–10% of diarrheic cases. To increase a better understanding of the prevalence and epidemiology of HAdV infection, a large scale and long-term study was needed. We implemented a multi-year molecular detection and characterization study of HAdV in association with acute gastroenteritis in Chiang Mai, Thailand from 2011 to 2017. Out of 2,312 patients, HAdV was detected in 165 cases (7.2%). The positive rate for HAdV infection was highest in children of 1 and 2 years of age compared to other age groups. HAdV subgroup C (40.6%) was the most prevalent, followed by subgroups F (28.5%), B (20.6%), A and D (4.8% each), and E (0.6%). Of these, HAdV-F41 (22.4%), HAdV-C2 (18.2%), HAdV-B3 (15.2%), and HAdV-C1 (13.3%) were the most common genotypes detected. HAdV infection occurred throughout the year with a higher detection rate between May and July. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the infection rate, seasonal distribution and genotype diversity of HAdV infection in children with diarrhea in Chiang Mai, Thailand over a period of 7 year. Not only enteric adenovirus (F40 and F41) but also non-enteric adenovirus (B3, C1, C2) may play an important role in gastroenteritis in this area. The information will be beneficial for the prevention and control of HAdV outbreaks in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2965848053,"Variants in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are known to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the potential role of TREM2 effect on synucleinopathy has not been characterized. In this study, we investigated whether loss of TREM2 function affects α-synucleinopathy both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells were exposed to α-synuclein (α-syn) in the presence or absence of TREM2 small interference RNA. For in vivo studies, wild-type controls and TREM2 gene knockout mice were intracranially injected in the substantia nigra with adeno-associated viral vectors expressing human α-syn (AAV-SYN) to induce PD. Our results revealed that knockdown of TREM2 aggravated α-syn-induced inflammatory responses in BV2 cells and caused greater apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells treated with BV2-conditioned medium. In mice, TREM2 knockout exacerbated dopaminergic neuron loss in response to AAV-SYN. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo TREM2 deficiency induced a shift from an anti-inflammatory toward a proinflammatory activation status of microglia. These data suggest that impairing microglial TREM2 signaling aggravates proinflammatory responses to α-syn and exacerbates α-syn-induced neurodegeneration by modulating microglial activation state.-Guo, Y., Wei, X., Yan, H., Qin, Y., Yan, S., Liu, J., Zhao, Y., Jiang, F., Lou, H. TREM2 deficiency aggravates α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease models."
https://openalex.org/W2965412252,"The formation of biofilms provides structural and adaptive bacterial response to the environment. In Bacillus species, the biofilm extracellular matrix is composed of exopolysaccharides, hydrophobins, and several functional amyloid proteins. We report, using multiscale approaches such as solid-state NMR (SSNMR), electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and immune-gold labeling, the molecular architecture of B. subtilis and pathogenic B. cereus functional amyloids. SSNMR data reveal that the major amyloid component TasA in its fibrillar amyloid form contain β-sheet and α-helical secondary structure, suggesting a nontypical amyloid architecture in B. subtilis. Proteinase K digestion experiments indicate the amyloid moiety is ∼100 aa long, and subsequent SSNMR and FTIR signatures for B. subtilis and B. cereus TasA filaments highlight a conserved amyloid fold, albeit with substantial differences in structural polymorphism and secondary structure composition. Structural analysis and coassembly data on the accessory protein TapA in B. subtilis and its counterpart camelysin in B. cereus reveal a catalyzing effect between the functional amyloid proteins and a common structural architecture, suggesting a coassembly in the context of biofilm formation. Our findings highlight nontypical amyloid behavior of these bacterial functional amyloids, underlining structural variations between biofilms even in closely related bacterial species.-El Mammeri, N., Hierrezuelo, J., Tolchard, J., Cámara-Almirón, J., Caro-Astorga, J., Álvarez-Mena, A., Dutour, A., Berbon, M., Shenoy, J., Morvan, E., Grélard, A., Kauffmann, B., Lecomte, S., de Vicente, A., Habenstein, B., Romero, D., Loquet, A.

https://openalex.org/W2966089143,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is currently under investigation as a promising technique for enhancement of athletic performance through modulating cortical excitability. Through consecutive randomization, 12 experienced bodybuilders were randomly assigned to two arms receiving either sham or real tDCS over the primary motor cortex (leg area) and left temporal cortex (T3) for 13 minutes in the first session. After 72 hours, both groups received the inverse stimulation. After the brain stimulation, cerebral hemodynamic response (using frontopolar hemoencephalography) was examined upon taking three computer-based cognitive tasks i.e. reasoning, memory and verbal ability using the Cambridge Brain Science-Cognitive Platform. Subsequently, the bodybuilders performed knee extension exercise while performance indicators including one-repetition maximum (1RM), muscular endurance (SEI), heart rate (ECG), motivation (VAS), surface electromyography over quadriceps femoris muscle (sEMG) and perceived exertion (RPE) were evaluated. The real tDCS vs. sham group showed decreased RPE and HR mean scores by 14.2% and 4.9%, respectively. Regarding muscular strength, endurance, and electrical activity, the 1RM, SEI, and sEMG factors improved by 4.4%, 16.9%, and % 5.8, respectively. Meanwhile, compared to sham, real tDCS did not affect the athletes' motivation. Incidentally, it turned out that subjects who underwent T3 anodal stimulation outperformed in memory (p = 0.02) and verbal functions (0.02) as well as their corresponding frontopolar hemodynamic response [(memory HEG (p = 0.001) and verbal HEG (p = 0.003)]. Our findings suggest that simultaneous tDCS-induced excitation over the M1 leg area and left temporal area may potentially improve the overall athletic performance in experienced bodybuilders (Trial registration: IRCT20181104041543N1, Registered on 4 Nov. 2018, retrospectively registered)."
https://openalex.org/W2964614725,"Physical activity (PA) is a known behavior to reduce cancer risk and improve cancer survivorship, yet adherence to PA guidelines is poor among the general population and cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which patients referred for exercise consultation within a clinical cancer prevention setting were meeting aerobic and resistance physical activity (PA) guidelines and to identify factors associated with guideline adherence. Between 2013 and 2015, cancer prevention patients and cancer survivors were interviewed by an exercise physiologist within an Integrative Health Program at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Prevention Center. PA adherence was defined as at least 150-minutes of moderate-intensity or 75-minutes of vigorous-intensity PA per week, along with resistance training at least 2 days per week. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with meeting or not meeting PA guidelines for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and aerobic and resistance exercise combined. Among 1,024 cancer prevention patients and survivors, 9% of patients adhered to guideline-based PA. Adherence to aerobic and resistance guidelines were 20% and 12%, respectively. Overweight or obesity was associated with not meeting guideline-based PA in both cancer prevention patients and cancer survivors. Among breast cancer survivors, combination treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy ('multimodal therapy') was robustly associated with not meeting aerobic guidelines (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.16). BMI and breast cancer treatment history are key determinants of PA behavior among cancer prevention patients and survivors. Poor adherence to PA guidelines is a key issue for cancer prevention patients and survivors, particularly obese patients and women who receive multimodal therapy for breast cancer. Identifying and connecting patients at highest risk of poor PA adherence with exercise programs is needed to improve PA, a key modifiable cancer risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W2965440640,"Most women with breast cancer in Ethiopia are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease, but the reasons for this have not been systematically investigated. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the main reasons for diagnosis of advanced stage breast cancer from the perspective of patients, family members, and health care providers.A qualitative study with in-depth interviews was conducted with 23 selected participants at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Oncology Clinic using a semi-structured interview guide. These participants were 13 breast cancer patients, 5 family members, and 5 health care providers. Data were transcribed into English, coded and analyzed using thematic analysis.Awareness about the causes, risk, initial symptoms, early detection methods, and treatment of breast cancer were uncommon, and misconceptions about the disease prevailed among breast cancer patients and family members. There was a sense of hopelessness and uncertainty about the effectiveness of conventional medicine amongst patients and family members. Consequently, performing spiritual acts (using holy water) or seeking care from traditional healers recurred amongst the interviewees. Not taking initial symptoms of breast cancer seriously by the patients, reliance on traditional medicines, competing priorities, financial hardship, older age, fear of diagnosis of cancer, and weak health systems (e.g., delay in referral and long waiting period for consultation) were noted as the main contributors to late diagnosis. In contrast, persuasion by family members and friends, higher educational attainment, and prior experience of neighboring women with breast cancer were mentioned to be facilitators of early diagnosis of breast cancer.The causes of late diagnosis of breast cancer in Ethiopia are multi-factorial and include individual, cultural, and health system factors. Interventions targeting these factors could alleviate the misconceptions and knowledge gap about breast cancer in the community, and shorten waiting time between symptom recognition and diagnosis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2964612001,"Background The United Kingdom (UK) was the first European country to introduce a national immunisation program for shingles (2013–2014). That year, vaccination coverage ranged from 50 to 64% across the UK, but uptake has declined ever since. This study explored determinants of the acceptance of the shingles vaccine in the UK. Methods Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, who were eligible for the last catch-up cohort of the 2014–2015 shingles vaccination campaign, were identified using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (the National Health Service data research service) and invited to participate by their general practitioner (GP). An anonymised self-administered questionnaire was developed using the Health Belief Model as a theoretical framework, to collect data on demographic and socio-economic characteristics, health status, knowledge, influences, experiences and attitudes to shingles and the shingles vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with vaccination. Physicians’ views concerning perceived barriers to vaccination were also assessed. Results Of the 2,530 questionnaires distributed, 536 were returned (21.2%) from 69 general practices throughout the UK. The majority of responders were female (58%), lived in care homes (56%) and had completed secondary or higher education (88%). There were no differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated responders. Being offered the shingles vaccine by a GP/nurse (odds ratio (OR) = 2.3), and self-efficacy (OR = 1.2) were associated with being vaccinated (p<0.05). In contrast, previous shingles history (OR = 0.4), perceived barriers to vaccination (OR = 0.7) and perceived control of the disease (OR = 0.7) were associated with not being vaccinated against shingles (p<0.05). Less than half (44.0%) of GPs were aware of the local communication campaigns regarding shingles and the shingles vaccine. Conclusions Socio-psychological factors largely influence shingles vaccination acceptance in this study. The results add to existing evidence that healthcare providers (HCPs) have a pivotal role against vaccine hesitancy. Campaigns focusing on GPs and accessible information offered to eligible members of the public can further enhance shingles vaccine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2966245656,"The impact of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ was evaluated in the metabolic alterations and the adipose tissue remodeling associated with obesity. Male Wistar rats were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD; 35% fat) or a standard diet (3.5% fat) for 7 wk and treated with MitoQ (200 µM). A proteomic analysis of visceral adipose tissue from patients with obesity and patients without obesity was performed. MitoQ partially prevented the increase in body weight, adiposity, homeostasis model assessment index, and adipose tissue remodeling in HFD rats. It also ameliorated protein level changes of factors involved in insulin signaling observed in adipose tissue of obese rats: reductions in adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) and increases in dipeptidylpeptidase 4, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation. MitoQ prevented down-regulation of adiponectin and GLUT 4 and increases in SOCS3 levels in a TNF-α-induced insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocyte model. MitoQ also ameliorated alterations in mitochondrial proteins observed in obese rats: increases in cyclophylin F and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A and reductions in mitofusin1, peroxiredoxin 4, and fumarate hydratase. The proteomic analysis of the visceral adipose tissue from patients with obesity show alterations in mitochondrial proteins similar to those observed in obese rats. Therefore, the data show the beneficial effect of MitoQ in the metabolic dysfunction induced by obesity.-Marín-Royo, G., Rodríguez, C., Le Pape, A., Jurado-López, R., Luaces, M., Antequera, A., Martínez-González, J., Souza-Neto, F.

https://openalex.org/W2965568984,"The clinical course of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) with fibrosis is similar to that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Current research is expected to identify biomarkers effective in predicting the deterioration of lung function in a clinical setting. Our group analyzed the relationships between the following parameters in chronic bird-related HP: patient characteristics, serum markers, lung function, HRCT findings, BALF profiles, and the worsening of lung function. We also analyzed serum levels of CXCL9, CCL17, and Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) as serum markers. Patients showing declines in vital capacity (VC) of over 5% at 6 months after first admission were categorized as the ""decline group""; the others were categorized as the ""stable group."" The serum level of CCL17 and the percentage of BALF macrophages were significantly higher in the decline group compared to the stable group. Serum levels of CXCL9 and CCL17 were significant variables in a multivariate logistic regression analysis of factors associated with VC decline. Patients with a chemokine profile combining lower serum CXCL9 and higher serum CCL17 exhibited significantly larger VC decline in a cluster analysis. Higher serum CCL17 and lower serum CXCL9 were important predictors of worsening lung function in patients with chronic bird-related HP."
https://openalex.org/W2966064756,"Clear-cuts of forests severely affect soil structure and thus soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient cycling dynamics therein, though with yet unknown consequences for SOM composition as well as phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) chemical form within the soil microaggregate size fraction. To determine the effects of conventional clear-cutting on soil chemistry in a Cambisol of the Wüstebach Forest (northwestern Germany), we sampled the mineral A- and B-horizons prior to clear-cut as well as 10 and 24 month thereafter. We measured the SOM composition of soil microaggregates using pyrolysis field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS), as well as P and S chemical form and speciation using wet-chemical extractions and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. We found that clear-cut led to an increase of the microaggregate size fraction up to 6% due to break-down of macroaggregates and initially significantly increased total elemental concentrations (C, N, P, S) due to the introduction of slash-residues. The SOM of slash-residues consisted to a substantial amount of sterols and was generally found to be of low thermal stability and probably did not contribute to aggregate stability. Deterioration of the aggregate structure probably led to an exposure of originally inaccessible sites within aggregates to the attack by soil microorganisms and thus to an increased P and S turnover as reflected in a significantly reduction of available P proportions (4 to 7%) and a reduction of the most reduced S forms (5%). A probable increased microbial activity and contribution to SOM after clear-cut is also reflected in the significantly increasing hexose:pentose ratio by 0.25 between 10 and 24 month after clear-cut, significantly increasing the general thermal stability of SOM in the microaggregate size fraction and believed to contribute to aggregate stability. This indicated that a first deterioration of the aggregate structure after clear-cut might in the long-term be remediated with time."
https://openalex.org/W2966643911,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that primarily target angiogenesis are approved to treat several cancers in the metastatic setting; however, resistance is common. Sequential treatment or ‘switching’ from one TKI to another following failure can be effective, but predicting which drugs will have cross-over sensitivity remains a challenge. Here we examined sitravatinib (MGCD516), a spectrum-selective TKI able to block MET, TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MerTK) and multiple receptor families (including PDGFRs, VEGFRs, and Ephs). Transcriptomic analysis of several mouse and human cell lines revealed diverse molecular changes after resistance to two TKIs (sunitinib and axitinib) with multiple sitravatinib targets found to be upregulated. Sitravatinib treatment in vitro resulted in enhanced anti-proliferative effects in resistant cells and was improved compared to TKIs with similar target profiles. In vivo, primary tumor growth inhibition after sitravatinib treatment in mice was enhanced in resistant tumors and metastasis suppression improved when tumors were surgically removed. Together, these results suggest that the diverse and often inconsistent compensatory signaling mechanisms found to contribute to TKI resistance may paradoxically improve the tumor-inhibiting effects of broad-spectrum TKIs such as sitravatinib that are able to block multiple signaling pathways. Sitravatinib in the second-line setting following antiangiogenic TKI treatment may have enhanced inhibitory effects in local and disseminated disease, and improve outcomes in patients with refractory disease."

These long-range circuits are crucial for accurate sensory perception and complex behavioral control; however, little is known about their precise circuit organization. Here we specifically identified the presynaptic input neurons to individual excitatory neuron clones as a unit that constitutes functional microcircuits in the mouse sensory cortex. Interestingly, the long-range input neurons in the frontal but not contralateral sensory area are spatially organized into discrete vertical clusters and preferentially form synapses with each other over nearby non-input neurons. Moreover, the assembly of distant presynaptic microcircuits in the frontal area depends on the selective synaptic communication of excitatory neuron clones in the sensory area that provide inputs to the frontal area. These findings suggest that highly precise long-range reciprocal microcircuit-to-microcircuit communication mediates frontal-sensory area interactions in the mammalian cortex.

Intricate neural circuits in the mammalian cerebral cortex support accurate sensory perception and complex behavioral control. The conventional view of sensory processing is built on a feedforward hierarchical information flow. Sensory representation starts at the periphery via sensory receptor activation and becomes progressively more complex as the information moves up the hierarchy (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J.

However, recent studies suggest that the feedforward (i.e., bottom-up) information pathway, including the primary sensory cortex, is subjected to robust top-down influences that reflect the internal representation of the world, such as attention, experience, and expectation (Buschman and Miller, 2007Buschman T.J.

These studies suggest that the columnar microcircuits consisting of individual sister excitatory neuron clones represent a basic functional unit in the sensory cortex. Therefore, they offer a unique opportunity to assess the precise spatial and circuit organization of long-range inputs, such as top-down modulation, to individual specific functional microcircuits in the sensory cortex, which have not been explored previously because of methodological and conceptual limitations. In this study, we set out to identify the presynaptic input neurons to individual excitatory neuron clones as a unit that constitute functional microcircuits in the mouse primary sensory cortex. We found that individual excitatory neuron clones in the primary somatosensory cortex receive long-range synaptic inputs from a selective group of excitatory neurons in the motor cortex that are spatially organized into discrete vertical clusters and preferentially develop synapses with each other, indicating the existence of precise presynaptic microcircuits in the frontal cortex. Interestingly, the preferential long-range input neuron connectivity in the frontal area depends on the selective synaptic communication within individual excitatory neuron clones in the sensory area that provide specific bottom-up input to the frontal area. These findings suggest that precise long-distance microcircuit-to-microcircuit communication mediates accurate distant interactions between the frontal and sensory areas of the mammalian cortex. EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein (G)-deleted rabies virus (RVdG)-mediated retrograde transsynaptic tracing allows labeling of monosynaptic inputs to selected starter postsynaptic neurons with high specificity and efficiency (Callaway, 2008Callaway E.M.

To identify the presynaptic neurons that innervate individual excitatory neuron clones as a unit, we engineered and introduced low-titer retroviruses expressing the red fluorescent protein DsRed-Express (DsRed), G, and the avian-specific retroviral receptor avian tumor virus receptor A (TVA; Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A.

At post-natal day 15 (P15)–P20, a cranial window was created over the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), covering the barrel field (bfd) (Figure 1B), trunk or lower limb (tr/ll) (Figure S1C), or upper limb (ul) area to search for sparsely labeled excitatory neuron clones expressing DsRed-G-TVA. Upon identifying such an isolated excitatory neuron clone, we carried out serial stereotaxic injections of EGFP-expressing RVdG next to the clone across all cortical layers (Figure 1A). Brains were recovered ∼7–10 days later for analyses. RVdG only infects cells expressing TVA and requires G to spread retrogradely to presynaptic neurons (Callaway, 2008Callaway E.M. Transneuronal circuit tracing with neurotropic viruses.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, Callaway and Luo, 2015Callaway E.M. Luo L.

Consistent with this, RVdG injection into the Nestin-TVA (Holland et al., 1998Holland E.C. Hively W.P. DePinho R.A. Varmus H.E.

Successful infection of the identified excitatory neuron clone resulted in a single yellow fluorescent starter excitatory neuron clone expressing both EGFP and DsRed in S1 (Figures 1B and S1C). As expected, the starter excitatory neuron clone contained neurons in both deep and superficial layers that were spatially organized into a radial or vertical cluster (Figures 1C, 1D, S1D, and S1E). On average, individual starter excitatory neuron clones consisted of ∼10 starter neurons with similar fractions in deep and superficial layers (Figures 1H–1J). In these experiments, transsynaptically labeled presynaptic neurons expressed EGFP only. We found extensive EGFP-expressing neurons in both deep and superficial layers surrounding the starter excitatory neuron clone (Figures 1C and S1D), representing the local presynaptic neurons. Moreover, we reliably observed EGFP-expressing presynaptic neurons located in distant cortical and subcortical regions, including the motor (M), secondary somatosensory (S2), AUD, and contralateral S1 (c-S1) areas and the thalamus (TH) (Figures 1E, 1F, S1F, and S1G). The labeling of input neurons in the ventral posterior (VP) and posterior (PO) thalamic nuclei is consistent with localization of the starter excitatory neuron clones in S1. To systematically examine the presynaptic neurons to individual excitatory neuron clones in S1 as a unit, we performed serial sectioning, immunostaining, and 3D reconstruction to recover all presynaptic neurons as well as the starter excitatory neuron clone across the entire brain (Figures 1G and S1H). We found that, in addition to extensive local inputs, excitatory neuron clones in S1 received prominent and consistent long-range inputs from the M, c-S1, S2, AUD, and TH regions (Figure 1K). Notably, the long-range input neurons expressed vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), a glutamatergic excitatory neuron marker (Figures S1I and S1J). They also displayed characteristic excitatory neuron morphology, including a pyramid-shaped cell body, a prominent apical dendrite, and numerous dendritic spines (Figures 1F, S1G, and S1I–S1K). Together, these results suggest that the long-range input neurons are glutamatergic excitatory neurons. The overall localization of long-range input neurons to individual S1 excitatory neuron clones is consistent with previous studies (Aronoff et al., 2010Aronoff R. Matyas F. Mateo C. Ciron C.

Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We found that, in the frontal secondary motor (M2) area, the input neurons were distributed in both superficial and deep layers (Figures 2A and 2C ). Interestingly, they often appeared in discrete radial clusters. To quantitatively assess the spatial distribution of the presynaptic neurons in M2, we applied random simulation to the experimental 3D construction datasets, which contained the same number of data points or neurons within the same volume repeated 100 times. Compared with the random simulated dataset (gray, one of 100 simulations), the experimental datasets of the input neurons (green) exhibited a similar percentage of cells in superficial and deep layers (Figures 2B and 2C), indicating an even distribution across these layers. Moreover, we examined the relative angle between individual input neuron pairs and the pia (Figure 2D, inset) and found that a significantly higher fraction of experimental input neuron pairs displayed an angle of 60°–90° (i.e., vertically distributed with respect to the pia) than that of random simulated datasets (Figures 2B and 2D). Together, these results suggest that presynaptic neurons in M2 providing top-down input to individual excitatory neuron clones in S1 are not randomly distributed but form discrete vertical clusters. To further test whether these discrete presynaptic neuron vertical clusters in M2 are indeed derived from individual S1 starter excitatory neuron clones, we collected RVdG tracing data of single S1 starter excitatory neuron in either the superficial (layers II–IV) or deep (layers V–VI) layer. Presynaptic neurons in M2 to a single superficial-layer excitatory neuron were predominantly located in the superficial layer (Figures S2A, top, and S2B). Similarly, presynaptic neurons to a single deep-layer excitatory neuron were largely located in the deep layer (Figures S2A, bottom, and S2B). Moreover, presynaptic neurons to a single excitatory neuron were more dispersed, with longer nearest neighbor distances (NNDs) (Figure S2C), and more horizontally or laterally distributed with respect to the pia than those to individual excitatory neuron clones (Figure S2D). These results suggest that presynaptic neurons to individual excitatory neuron clones are fundamentally different from those to a single excitatory neuron, consistent with the notion that the presynaptic neuron clusters in M2 innervating individual excitatory neuron clones in S1 are derived from clonally related starter neurons in both deep and superficial layers as a unit. The spatial organization of top-down input neurons in M2 into discrete vertical clusters raises the intriguing possibility that they are synaptically connected and represent well-organized local presynaptic microcircuits. To test this, we labeled presynaptic neurons to individual S1 excitatory neuron clones in M2 (Figures 3A and S3A). To assess synaptic connectivity of the input neurons in M2, we prepared acute brain slices ∼7–10 days after RVdG injection and performed quadruple"
https://openalex.org/W2965683187,"Patent Foramen Ovale and impaired cerebral hemodynamics were proposed among the pathophysiological mechanisms explaining the increased risk for stroke in patients with Migraine with Aura (MA). Our study aimed at comparing the vasomotor reactivity (VMR) of the anterior and the posterior cerebral circulation in patients with Migraine with Aura, in patients with acute vascular ischemic accidents, and in controls. We hypothesized that VMR in MA patients is preserved in the anterior circulation and reduced in the posterior circulation. We prospectively assessed with Transcranial Doppler the vasomotor reactivity to breath holding of the Middle and Posterior Cerebral Arteries (MCA, PCA) in MA patients, in acute vascular patients and healthy controls. We also evaluated the possible effect of clinical characteristics of MA (attack frequency, aura length or type, disease history), vascular factors and the presence of right-to-left shunt on VMR. Diverging from our hypothesis, MA patients displayed a higher breath-holding index (BHI) than controls in the MCA (1.84±0.47%/s vs 1.53±0.47%/s, p = .001) as well as in the PCA (1.87±0.65%/s vs 1.47±0.44%/s, p < .001). In MA patients, MCA BHI was higher in those with large right-to-left shunts (2.09±0.42 vs 1.79±0.47, p = .046) and lower in those taking estrogens (1.30±0.30%/s vs 1.9±0.45%/s, p = .009). We did not observe an effect of MA characteristics on BHI. The increased BHI in MA patients with large right-to-left shunts could be explained by the vasoactive effect in the cerebral circulation of substances bypassing the deactivating pulmonary filters or by a constitutional trait of the vascular system associating persistent right-to-left shunts and hyper-reactive hemodynamics. Our results discourage the hypothesis that altered hemodynamics contribute to increasing the stroke risk in all MA patients. However, estrogens can lower VMR, curtailing the hemodynamic resources of MA patients."

Understanding prevalence and predictors of NASH with advanced fibrosis is critical for healthcare resource planning. Using a large U.S. clinical laboratory database from 10/1/2017-9/30/2018, adults negative for hepatitis B and hepatitis C and after excluding for alcoholic liver disease and pregnancy were evaluated for prevalence of F3 and F4 fibrosis using a systematic algorithm of five fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) criteria: Criteria 1 (≥F3: >2.67), Criteria 2 (2.67<F3≤4.12 and F4>4.12), Criteria 3 (2.67<F3≤3.15, F4>3.15), Criteria 4 (3.25<F3≤3.5, F4>3.5), Criteria 5 (3.25<F3≤4.12, F4>4.12). Metabolic co-morbidities evaluated included decreased high density lipoprotein (<40 mg/dL men, <50 mg/dL women), high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), elevated hemoglobin A1C (≥6.5%). Parallel analyses of patients with specific NAFLD/NASH ICD-9/10 codes from 10/1/2013-9/30/2018 were performed. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for predictors of ≥F3 fibrosis. Among patients with NAFLD/NASH ICD-9/10 codes, ≥F3 prevalence ranged from 4.35% - 6.90%, and F4 prevalence ranged from 2.52%– 3.67%. Increasing metabolic co-morbidities was associated with higher risk of ≥F3 fibrosis. Compared to NASH patients without metabolic co-morbidities, NASH with four concurrent metabolic co-morbidities had higher risk of ≥F3 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.40–1.73, p<0.001). In summary, prevalence of NASH with advanced fibrosis among U.S. adults was as high as 6.90% and prevalence of NASH with cirrhosis was as high as 3.67%, representing 5.18 million and 2.75 million, respectively, when using an estimate of 75 million U.S. adults with NAFLD. Co-morbid metabolic abnormalities were associated with higher risk of advanced fibrosis among NASH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2966741598,"The Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases are co-expressed in the developing nervous system, where they are involved in different aspects of neuronal development, including the formation of synapses. The deletion of both Rac genes determines a stronger reduction of dendritic spines in vitro compared to the knockout of either gene, indicating that Rac1 and Rac3 play a synergistic role in the formation of these structures. Here, we have addressed the role of each GTPase in the formation of dendritic spines by overexpressing either Rac1 or Rac3 in wildtype neurons, or by re-expressing either GTPase in double knockout hippocampal cultures. We show that the Rac3 protein is expressed with Rac1 in developing hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of either GTPase in WT neurons increases the density of dendritic spines, suggesting the involvement of both GTPases in their formation. We also found that the re-expression of either Rac1 or Rac3 in double knockout neurons is sufficient to restore spinogenesis. Rac1 is significantly more efficient than Rac3 in restoring the formation of spines. On the other hand the quantitative analysis in neurons overexpressing or re-expressing either GTPase shows that Rac3 induces a more pronounced increase in the size of the spines compared to Rac1. These enlarged spines form morphological synapses identified by the juxtaposition of postsynaptic and presynaptic markers. Thus, while Rac1 appears more efficient in inducing the formation of mature spines, Rac3 is more efficient in promoting their enlargement. Our study highlights specific roles of Rac1 and Rac3, which may be functionally relevant also to synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2964867302,"Need for Cognition describes relatively stable interindividual differences in cognitive motivation. Previous research has shown relations of Need for Cognition to Self-Control-a capacity that can be broadly defined as resistance to temptation-yet, the processes underlying this relation remain unclear. One explanation for the prediction of Self-Control by Need for Cognition can be an increased motivation to invest cognitive effort with higher levels of Need for Cognition. Another possible link could be that individual differences in the implementation of Self-Control intentions may play a moderating or mediating role for the predictive value of Need for Cognition. Such individual differences in the self-motivated initiation and maintenance of intentions are described by dispositional Action Orientation. Therefore, in the present study, Action Orientation was examined with regard to its possible role in explaining the relation of Need for Cognition to Self-Control. In a sample of 1209 young adults, Self-Control was assessed with two different self-report instruments and moderation and mediation models of the relationship between Need for Cognition, Action Orientation, and Self-Control were tested. While there was no evidence for a moderating role of Action Orientation in explaining the relation of Need for Cognition and Self-Control, Action Orientation was found to partly mediate this relation with a remaining direct effect of Need for Cognition on Self-Control. These results add to the conceptual understanding of Need for Cognition and demonstrate the relevance of trait variables to predict Self-Control."

Body height, body weight and thickness of 2 skinfolds (triceps skinfold and abdomen skinfold) were measured. Body mass index (BMI) and fat percentage (FAT%) were also calculated.Current university students are taller and heavier than their peers from the previous decades, with BMI remaining within the reference range. A substantial increase in fat percentage was found in both groups. Over the period of fifty years, mean fat percentage in students from the university of technology increased by 6.3% (F1,3 = 116.56, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.3736), whereas this increase in the students from the university of physical education rose by 3.5% (F1,3 = 72.94, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.3181).Changes in secular trends in the students from both universities are likely to be linked to the dynamic economic and systematic transformation in Poland observed in the period of the last 50 years. The period of economic transformations in the last decade was more conducive to physical development of university students than the previous period of economic crises."

However, there is lack of attention on the selection of reference genes for miRNA expression profiling in insect herbivores. Here, we explored the candidate reference genes in a notorious pest of cruciferous crops, Plutella xylostella, for normalization of miRNA expression in developmental stages and tissues and in response to a change of food source from artificial diet to host plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We first compared the expression levels and stability of eight small RNAs using qRT-PCR, and found that miR11 was the most suitable reference gene for expression quantification of the miRNAs. We then confirmed this finding using digital droplet PCR and further validated with a well-studied cross-kingdom miRNA derived from A. thaliana (ath-miR159a). However, none of the reference genes was applicable for all experimental conditions, and multiple reference genes were sometimes required within the same experiment. Our work provides a method for the selection of reference genes for quantification of plant-derived miRNAs, which paves the way for unveiling their roles in the insect-plant coevolution."
https://openalex.org/W2966636034,"Controversies exist regarding the impact of age on gastric cancer-related mortality according to cancer stage. In our prospective cohort study, we evaluated the impact of age on stage-specific mortality in patients with gastric cancer. Between 2002 and 2006, patients with newly diagnosed gastric cancer were recruited from two university-affiliated hospitals in Korea. Follow-up data were updated regularly based on medical records and telephone surveys. Patients were classified into four subgroups according to age: <50, 50–59, 60–69, and 70–79 years. A total of 448 patients were followed up for 81.6 months (interquartile range, 25.0–139.3 months). The number of patients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease was 247, 74, 88, and 39, respectively. Overall, age was an independent risk factor for gastric cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR], [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.53 [0.91–2.57], 1.88 [1.21–2.91], and 2.64 [1.69–4.14] in the 50–59, 60–69, and 70–79 years groups, respectively, with the <50 years group as reference). In patients with stage I and II gastric cancer, the 70–79 years group was associated with a significantly higher rate of cancer-specific mortality than the <50 years group (stage I: HR [95% CI], 9.55 [2.11–43.12]; stage II: HR [95% CI], 7.17 [2.32–22.18]). However, age was not an independently associated factor for cancer-specific mortality in patients with stage III and IV gastric cancer. Although age was an independent risk factor for gastric cancer-related mortality in patients with gastric cancer, its impact may differ depending on the stage of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2965356171,"The purpose of this study was to explore the correlations between land use/cover change and cultivated land ecological security in flatland and mountainous areas. Firstly, the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of land use/cover change are described in conjunction with ArcGIS10.5 software based on remote sensing images of 2005 and 2015. Then, by establishing a pressure-support framework as an assessment indicator system and developing an improved BP neural network model via a genetic algorithm with the help of MATLAB2016a, the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of cultivated land ecological security in Yuxi City from 2005 to 2015 are evaluated. The results showed that the transformation of farmland area accounted for a large proportion of increased constructive land and land use/cover spatial variations were significantly different among counties, which manifested the changes in farmland and the construction land in flatland areas but also facilitated a mutual transformation of forest and grass in mountainous areas. Moreover, ecological security status presented a clear difference among counties due to their different land use/cover changes. The ecological security state of the flatland expressed a higher ecological pressure and lower ecological support, so the security grade was IV. Otherwise, the ecological security was superior and the security grade was level II or I in the mountainous areas. Thus, protection strategies for ecological security should be differentiated in the flatland areas and mountainous areas due to their different ecological security status brought by land use/cover change."

In this time-lapse study we investigated the influence of endometriosis on morphokinetic parameters of embryo development, taking variables of dynamic monitoring into account. Furthermore we evaluated reproductive medicine treatment outcome such as fetal heartbeat and live birth rate.1148 embryos (control: n = 596, endometriosis: n = 552) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were stimulated with GnRH antagonist protocol. After fertilization, embryos were incubated in a time-lapse system (EmbryoScope).The mixed-model analysis revealed a significant main effect of time (p<0.001), with post-hoc tests showing that any time needed to reach a specific developmental stage was significantly different from all the others (all p<0.001). Embryos of endometriosis patients showed the same absolute morphokinetic time parameters as the control group, however, synchronization of early embryo cell divisions (s2) was faster in endometriosis patients compared to the control group.In general, endometriosis does not induce changes in early embryo morphokinetics. However, observed acceleration in cell cycle synchronization of embryo cleavage patterns might be a missing explanation for contradicting results in literature regarding the impairments in reproductive medicine treatment outcome of endometriosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2966844127,"To identify blood cell markers that predict the long-term outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer.Data from 892 stage II and III colorectal cancer patients who underwent R0 resection were included. We analyzed the correlations of the preoperative blood data, previously reported prognostic indices, and clinicopathologic factors with the long-term outcomes, such as relapse-free survival and overall survival, using univariate and multivariate analyses.Multivariate analysis showed that tumor location, stage, mean corpuscular volume, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to- monocyte ratio were significantly correlated with relapse-free survival. A mean corpuscular volume ≥80.5 fL, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≥5.5, and lymphocyte-to- monocyte ratio <3.4 had hazard ratios for disease relapse between 1.39 and 1.93. The cumulative scores of these three factors were aggregated into a laboratory prognostic score, with a maximum score at 6. The relapse-free survival and overall survival were well stratified by a laboratory prognostic score between 0-3 and 4-6, respectively, independent of the stage.The mean corpuscular volume, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to- monocyte ratio can serve as blood cell markers to predict the long-term outcomes of patients who underwent R0 resection for stage II/III colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2964366783,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains an important source of progressive chronic kidney injury. Loss of renal blood flow with subsequent restoration, termed ischemia reperfusion (IR), is a common cause of AKI. The cell surface receptor signal regulatory protein α (SIRP-α) is expressed on macrophages and limits inflammation and phagocytosis. SIRP-α has recently been found to have wider cell-based expression and play a role in renal IR. We have explored this in a genetic model of deficient SIRP-α signaling. Mice lacking SIRP-α cytoplasmic signaling (SIRP-αmut) and wild-type (WT) littermate controls underwent renal ischemia and reperfusion. Chimeric mice transplanted with WT or SIRP-αmut bone marrow were similarly challenged following engraftment. Molecular and immunohistochemical analysis of renal function, tissue damage, and key molecular targets was performed. SIRP-αmut mice were protected from renal IR compared with WT animals, demonstrating improved serum creatinine, less histologic damage, reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, and diminished production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Resistance to renal IR in SIRP-αmut occurred alongside down-regulation of CD47 and thrombospondin-1, which are known to exert SIRP-α crosstalk and also promote IR. In chimeric mice, lack of SIRP-α signaling conferred protection to IR regardless of the genotype of circulating cells. Renal tubular epithelial cells from SIRP-αmut mice produced fewer ROS and proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. These results identify parenchymal SIRP-α as an independent driver of IR-mediated AKI and a potential therapeutic target.—Ghimire, K., Chiba, T., Minhas, N., Meijles, D.

https://openalex.org/W2965458785,"Environmental temperatures and oxygen availability are important for the balance between oxygen supply and demand. Terrestrial organisms are generally perceived to be less limited by access to oxygen than their aquatic counterparts. Nevertheless, even terrestrial environments can be deficient in oxygen, especially for organisms occurring in soil, litter, wood, rotten fruit or at high elevations. While isopods are the best adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle among crustaceans, many species, including woodlice, occupy environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen. To investigate whether mismatches between oxygen supply and demand can result in a loss of performance in a terrestrial organism, we studied the effects of atmospheric oxygen concentration on the thermal performance of the common rough woodlouse (Porcellio scaber). We compared the thermal preference, thermal sensitivity of running speed, and tolerance to extreme temperatures of woodlice exposed to one of two oxygen concentrations (21% - normoxia, 7% - hypoxia). Under hypoxia, P. scaber preferred microhabitats with temperatures that were on average 3°C lower than those preferred under normoxia. The running speed tended to reach its maximum at a lower temperature under hypoxia than under normoxia (25.13°C vs 28.87°C, respectively, although p was equal to 0.09), and normoxic woodlice ran approximately 1.5-fold faster than hypoxic woodlice at the point of maximum speed. Heat tolerance was significantly lower under hypoxia (38.9°C) than under normoxia (40.7°C), but there was no difference in cold tolerance (5.81°C under normoxia and 5.44°C under hypoxia). Overall, our results indicate that environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen may shape the physiological performance of terrestrial ectotherms, likely via their effects on the balance between oxygen supply and demand, which may have fitness consequences for these organisms in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2965468235,"α-Synuclein (α-syn) protein aggregation is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders collectively referred to as synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. We used protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to study α-syn aggregation in brain homogenates of wild-type or transgenic mice expressing normal (D line) or A53T mutant (M83 line) human α-syn. We found that sonication-incubation cycles of M83 mouse brain gradually produce large quantities of SDS-resistant α-syn aggregates, involving both human and mouse proteins. These PMCA products, containing partially proteinase K-resistant α-syn species, are competent to accelerate the onset of neurologic symptoms after intracerebral inoculation to young M83 mice and to seed aggregate formation of α-syn following PMCA, including in D and wild-type mouse brain substrates. PMCA seeding activity in the M83 diseased brain correlates positively with regions mostly targeted by the α-syn pathology in this model. Our data indicate that similar to prions, PMCA can reproduce some characteristics of α-syn aggregation and seeded propagation in vitro in a complex milieu. This opens new opportunities for the molecular study of synucleinopathies.-Nicot, S., Verchère, J., Bélondrade, M., Mayran, C., Bétemps, D., Bougard, D., Baron, T.

https://openalex.org/W2966329047,"Currently, quantifying β-cell mass (BCM) requires harvesting the pancreas. In this study, we investigated a potential noninvasive method to quantify BCM changes longitudinally using [Lys12(111In-BnDTPA-Ahx)]exendin-4 ([111In]-Ex4) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We used autoradiography and transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of mouse insulin 1 gene promotor to evaluate the specificity of [111In]-Ex4 toward β cells. Using nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, we injected [111In]-Ex4 (3.0 MBq) intravenously and performed SPECT 30 min later, repeating this at a 2-wk interval. After the second scan, we harvested the pancreas and calculated BCM from immunohistochemically stained pancreatic sections. Specific accumulation of [111In]-Ex4 in β cells was confirmed by autoradiography, with a significant correlation (r = 0.94) between the fluorescent and radioactive signal intensities. The radioactive signal from the pancreas in the second SPECT scan significantly correlated (r = 0.89) with BCM calculated from the immunostained pancreatic sections. We developed a regression formula to estimate BCM from the radioactive signals from the pancreas in SPECT scans. BCM can be quantified longitudinally and noninvasively by SPECT imaging with [111In]-Ex4. This technique successfully demonstrated longitudinal changes in BCM in NOD mice before and after onset of hyperglycemia.-Fujita, N., Fujimoto, H., Hamamatsu, K., Murakami, T., Kimura, H., Toyoda, K., Saji, H., Inagaki, N.

https://openalex.org/W2966351357,"We aimed to investigate the clinical factors affecting the therapeutic effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We reviewed the medical records of 374 T2DM patients aged between 20 and 75 years who were prescribed empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg as add-on therapy for more than 90 consecutive days. Changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline levels and the reduction in body weights of the study participants were assessed. We found that younger patients (≤ 50 years), patients with the highest levels of HbA1c (>9%) at baseline, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >90 mL/min/1.73 m2, and patients with a shorter duration of T2DM (< 10 years) were more likely to exhibit a better glycemic response. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that a shorter duration of T2DM, higher baseline levels of HbA1c, and higher eGFR were positively associated with HbA1c reduction. Higher BMI and lower HbA1c levels were predictors of a more significant reduction in body weight among patients taking empagliflozin. The glucose-lowering effect of empagliflozin was more evident in T2DM patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels, better renal function, and shorter duration of T2DM."

We hypothesized that the PImax and 6MWD combination could improve their individual accuracy as risk predictors. We aimed to evaluate PImax ability as a mortality predictor in HF and whether the combination to 6MWD could improve risk stratification.Prospective cohort from HF Clinics of three University Hospitals. PImax, 6MWD and pVO2 were obtained at baseline. The end point was all cause mortality.Consecutive 256 individuals (50% woman, 57.4±10.4years) with low ejection fraction (LVEF) (31.8±8.6%) were followed up to 10years. During a median follow-up of 34.7 (IQR 37) months, 110 participants died. Mean±SD values were: pVO2 14.9±5.1mL/kg/min, PImax 5.5±1.3kPa and 6MWD 372±118m. In multivariate Cox regression, pVO2, PImax, 6MWD and LVEF were independent mortality predictors. The pVO2 showed gold standard accuracy, followed by PImax (AUC = 0.84) and 6MWD (AUC = 0.74). Kaplan-Meier mean survival time (MST±SE) for lower (≤5.0kPa) and higher (>6.0kPa) PImax tertiles, were 37.9±2.8months and 105.0±5.2months respectively, and addition of 6MWD did not restratified risk. For intermediate PImax tertile, MST was 81.5±5.5months, but adding 6MWD, MST was lower (53.3±7.6months) if distance was ≤350m and higher (103.1±5.7months) for longer distances.PImax is an independent mortality predictor in HF, more accurate than 6MWD and LVEF. Addition of 6MWD empowers risk stratification only for intermediate PImax tertile. Although less accurate than pVO2, this simpler approach could be a feasible alternative as a prognostic assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2965196228,"Background Patient feedback after contact with a hospital is regarded as an important source of information for the improvement of local healthcare services. Routine patient surveys are in widespread use to obtain such feedback. While general principles for the composition of this kind of surveys have been described in the literature, it is unknown which method of contact and topics of feedback are important to patients in postcontact healthcare surveys. Material and methods We invited 2931 consecutive patients who had in- or outpatient contact with the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at the University Hospital Basel to an anonymous survey. They were asked whether they were generally in favor of feedback surveys. They also had the opportunity to state their preferred form of contact (text message, app, email, online or letter) and provide up to three topics that they regarded as specifically important in patient surveys. Results A total of 745 patients participated in the survey (25.4%), of these 61.9% expressed the preference to be surveyed, and 69.1% selected `letter’ as one of the preferred forms of contact. Favoring only `letter’ contact increased substantially with age. Overall 54.6% of patients stated at least one topic that they wished to give feedback on. The most frequent topics were related to treatment and rather general aspects regarding staff and overall impression. The wish to include suggestions for improvements was rarely mentioned as specific topic. Conclusions The majority of patients seem to be rather indifferent to the existence and content of patient surveys. They mention a wide range of topics from general to specific ones, but do not express interest in the opportunity to suggest changes. There is a need to effectively engage patients in healthcare planning using new approaches to obtain valuable feedback on patients’ hospital stay and contact experiences. These new approaches should ideally be more informative and cost-effective than the current practice."

However, little is known as to whether exercise has mental health benefits for adults experiencing chronic low back pain (CLBP). The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of two intervention protocols commonly used in clinical practice for treating chronic low back pain, but with differing exercise dose, on depressive symptoms.Forty men and women (mean age = 35) experiencing chronic persistent (>3 months), non-specific low back pain were recruited into a randomised clinical trial during 2015-2016. Participants were randomised to receive motor control (low-dose exercise) and manual therapy (n = 20), or general strength and conditioning training (moderate-dose exercise) (n = 20). Depressive symptoms were assessed fortnightly throughout a 6-month follow-up period using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 10). Linear mixed models were used to examine within-group and between-group changes in depressive symptoms.Mean CES-D 10 score at baseline was 9.17 (SD = 4.32). There was evidence of a small decrease in average depressive symptoms over time (β -0.19 per fortnight, 95% CI = -0.34, -0.02). However, there was no evidence that change over time was dependent on treatment group.Reduction in depressive symptoms amongst adults with CLBP occurred with both treatment methods (motor control [low-dose exercise] and manual therapy; or general strength and conditioning [moderate-dose exercise]).

To identify the common clinicopathological features of MET exon 14 skipping mutations and amplification and clarify whether the two MET gene alterations cause protein overexpression were investigated using 196 lung cancer samples of Taiwan through real time-qPCR/sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. The two MET gene alterations are both present in low frequency, ~1%, in the studied lung cancer population of Taiwan. MET exon 14 skipping mutations were identified from two early-stage patients, who were both relatively advanced in age, and did not carry other driver mutations. One was an adenocarcinoma and the other was a rare carcinosarcoma. Three gene amplifications cases were identified. Neither of the two MET gene alterations would lead to protein overexpression; hence, direct detection in nucleic acid level would be a preferred and straightforward solution for the identification of skipping mutations. The presence of MET exon 14 mutations in minor histological types of lung cancers urge to extend screening scope of this mutation in lung cancer and treatment response evaluation in clinical trials. These would be important next steps for the success of MET target therapy in clinical practice."

Despite this initiative, unaccredited informal providers (IPs) often remain patients' first point of contact, which has led to inconsistencies in treatment, and has compromised the quality of care.To explore the factors that influence patients' decisions about healthcare providers in rural areas of central India.Nine focus group discussions (FGDs) were held in nine villages in central India. Framework analysis using an inductive approach was used to analyse the data.The crosscutting theme across the discussions was not choice but need-the need for affordable and accessible health care regardless of the provider's qualification. Results highlighted that IPs play a pivotal role in villagers' lives. Formal healthcare services were accessed infrequently, and mainly when a condition was judged severe or possibly even fatal. Even then, affordability was carefully weighed. Villagers' distance from formal providers contributed to high cost and low preference of formal providers. When opting for IPs, familiarity and trust were more important to villagers than qualifications. IPs have operated in rural communities in India for a long time and have adapted their services to meet the needs, preferences, social norms, and economic conditions of villagers.IPs have captured a niche and are often the first contact point in rural settings even when patients ultimately are diagnosed and treated by trained doctors. Merely tackling the undersupply of qualified doctors is not effective or sufficient to impact on the rural healthcare system: the strong and prevalent influence of IPs needs to be addressed also."
https://openalex.org/W2966448883,"Background/Aim No-reflow is a serious and frequent event during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to identify possible predictors for no-reflow. Patients and methods We investigated 218 patients with acute anterior STEMI who underwent PPCI from December 2016 to December 2018. No-reflow was defined as a coronary TIMI flow grade of ≤ 2. TIMI flow grade 3 was defined as normal reflow. Results In our study, the no-reflow phenomenon was observed in 39 patients (18%) during angiography. The patients of no-reflow group were found to be more older, diabetics, longer pain-to-balloon time, lower blood pressure, higher platelet counts and higher levels of D-Dimer and Cystatin C (Cys-C). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only diabetes (OR = 0.371, 95% CI: 0.157–0.872, P = 0.023), longer pain-to-balloon time (OR = 1.147, 95% CI: 1.015–1.297, P = 0.028) and higher Cys-C level (OR = 10.07, 95% CI: 2.340–43.377, P = 0.002) were predictors for no-reflow. Conclusion Cys-C might be a useful predictor for the no-reflow phenomenon after PPCI in STEMI patients. It might help to screen STEMI patients with high risk of no-reflow on admission."

A highly sensitive immunoassay system with GC-SPFS was constructed using a plastic sensor chip reproducibly fabricated in-house by nanoimprinting and applied to the quantitative detection of an anti-lysozyme single-domain antibody (sdAb), to compare conventional washing B/F separation with optical B/F separation. Differences in the affinity of the anti-lysozyme sdAb, induced by artificial mutation of only one amino acid residue in the variable domain were attributed to higher sensitivity than that of the conventional Biacore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. The detection limit (LOD; means of six replicates of the zero standard plus three standard deviations) of the GC-SPFS immunoassay with optical B/F separation, was estimated to be 1.2 ng/ml with the low-affinity ligand (mutant sdAb Y52A: KD level was of the order of 10−7 ~ 10−6 M) and was clearly improved as compared to that (LOD: 9.4 ng/ml) obtained with the conventional washing B/F separation. These results indicate that GC-SPFS with the optical B/F separation technique offers opportunities to re-evaluate low-affinity biomaterials that are neither fully utilized nor widespread, and could facilitate the creation of novel and innovative methods in drug and diagnostic development."
https://openalex.org/W2965732419,"Background Walking capacity tests are commonly used to evaluate interventions aiming at reducing walking impairment in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). However, their ecological validity has recently been questioned. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ecological validity of the 2- and 6-minutes walking tests (2MWT and 6MWT) and the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) after 28 days of multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation (MIR) in pwMS using accelerometry. Methods PwMS wore an accelerometer on 7 consecutive days within a 14-day period prior to MIR, performed 2/6MWT and T25FW at the beginning and at the end of MIR, followed by another 7 consecutive days of accelerometry. Results Significant improvements in 2/6MWT and T25FW after MIR in a cohort of 76 pwMS (mean age = 47.9, SD 8.3 years) were overall correlated to a significant gain in everyday life mobility (total steps/day). However, the correlation was strongly dependent on pre-existing walking disability defined by EDSS and only pwMS with “mild” walking impairment (EDSS 2–3.5) were able to transfer benefits measurable by walking capacity tests into improved everyday life mobility, while pwMS with “moderate to severe” walking disability (EDSS 4–6.5) were not. Conclusion Ecological validity of changes in walking capacity tests following MIR is strongly dependent on pre-existing walking impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2966838468,"Simvastatin reduces pulmonary arterial pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy in animal models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is thought to restore endothelial dysfunction. In vivo effects of drugs are complicated by several factors and little is known of the direct effects of statins on pulmonary arteries. This study investigated the direct effects of simvastatin on pulmonary arteries isolated from rats with or without monocrotaline-induced PAH. Simvastatin suppressed contractions evoked by the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 (30 nM), the α1–adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (5 μM) and KCl (50 mM) by ~50% in healthy and diseased arteries, but did not reduce contraction evoked by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase blockers. It relaxed hypertensive arteries in the absence of stimulation. Removing the endothelium or inhibiting eNOS did not prevent the inhibition by simvastatin. Inhibiting RhoA/rho kinase (ROCK) with Y27632 (10 μM) suppressed contractions to U46619 and phenylephrine by ~80% and prevented their inhibition by simvastatin. Y27632 reduced KCl-induced contraction by ~30%, but did not prevent simvastatin inhibition. Simvastatin suppressed Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells, as detected by Mn2+ quench of fura-2 fluorescence. The calcium antagonist, nifedipine (1 μM), almost abolished K+-induced contraction with less effect against U46619 and phenylephrine. We conclude that simvastatin relaxes pulmonary arteries by acting on smooth muscle to interfere with signalling through G-protein coupled receptors and voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry. Its actions likely include inhibition of ROCK-dependent Ca2+ sensitisation and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. These are likely to contribute to the beneficial effects of simvastatin in animal models of PAH."
https://openalex.org/W2965380416,"Depletion of oxygen levels is a well-accepted model for induction of non-replicating, persistent states in mycobacteria. Increasing the stress levels in mycobacterium bacilli facilitates their entry into a non-cultivable, dormant state. In this study, it was shown that diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADH oxidase, induced a viable, but non-culturable state in mycobacteria, having similar features to dormant bacilli, like loss of acid-fastness, upregulation of stress-regulated genes and decreased superoxide levels as compared to actively growing bacilli. Comprehensive, untargeted metabolic profiling also confirmed a decrease in biogenesis of amino acids, NAD, unsaturated fatty acids and nucleotides. Additionally, an increase in the level of lactate, fumarate, succinate and pentose phosphate pathways along with increased mycothiol and sulfate metabolites, similar to dormant bacilli, was observed in the granuloma. These non-cultivable bacilli were resuscitated by supplementation of fetal bovine serum, regaining their culturability in liquid as well as on agar medium. This study focused on the effect of diphenyleneiodonium treatment in causing mycobacteria to rapidly transition from an active state into a viable, but non-cultivable state, and comparing their characteristics with dormant phenotypes."

We identified AS patients newly diagnosed between 2005 to 2012 as the study group and selected age, sex and index-year matched (1:6) non-AS individuals as controls. The association between tonsillitis and risk of newly diagnosed AS was determined by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression analysis.We identified 37,002 newly diagnosed AS cases and 222,012 matched non-AS controls. Patients with AS were more likely to have tonsillitis (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.43-1.50), appendicitis (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13-1.48) and periodontitis (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.31-1.38) than non-AS control subjects. The association between tonsillitis and AS was consistent using varying definitions for tonsillitis, and we further found that a high frequency of visits for tonsillitis, a high medical cost for tonsillitis and a long interval between diagnosis were associated with newly diagnosed AS in a dose-response manner. Furthermore, the association between tonsillitis and AS appeared to be stronger in females (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.53-1.65) than those in males (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.35-1.44).The present study revealed an association between AS risk and prior tonsillitis and indicates the need for vigilance of AS-associated symptoms in patients who had been diagnosed with tonsillitis, particularly in females."
https://openalex.org/W2964590567,"This in vitro study examined the sealing ability of different desensitizing agents under a chemo-mechanical stress condition. For the study, a total of 144 extracted, caries-free human third molars were used to produce 1 mm-thick dentin discs. The specimens were divided randomly into four groups: Superseal (SS), Gluma (GL), Gluma Self-etch (GS), and Tooth Coat (TC). For each group, the permeability was measured before and after applying the desensitizer, after being exposed to Coca Cola for 5 minutes, and after 3150 strokes of a brushing abrasion. The decrease in permeability after the erosive and abrasive stress was analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test. As a result, the dentin permeability decreased significantly for all desensitizers immediately after application (p < 0.05). SS and GS showed a significant difference in permeability reduction observed immediately after application and after acid action with Coca Cola (p < 0.05). After brushing abrasion, the permeability reduction decreased significantly for all desensitizers tested in this study (p < 0.05). TC showed the largest decrease in dentinal permeability compared to that of the other desensitizers and the differences were significant after brushing abrasion (p < 0.05). All tested desensitizers were effective in reducing dentin permeability. The behavioral characteristics under erosive and abrasive stress varied according to the products used. TC exhibited excellent sealing ability among the other desensitizers."
https://openalex.org/W2966161001,"Many scientific researchers aspire to engage policy in their writing, but translating scientific research and findings into policy discussion often requires an understanding of the institutional complexities of legal and policy processes and actors. To examine how researchers have undertaken that challenge, we developed a set of metrics and applied them to articles published in one of the principal academic publication venues for science and policy-Science magazine's Policy Forum. We reviewed each Policy Forum article published over a five-year period (2011-15), 220 in all. For each article, we assessed the level of policy content based on presence of a stated policy proposal or position and identification of the relevant policy actors and actions, and recorded attributes such as field of science, field of policy, number of references to legal and policy sources, number of authors from law and policy institutions, and number of citations. We find that a handful of science fields dominate publication frequency, but that all fields have produced publications with high policy engagement. Of the attributes, number of references to law and policy sources is correlated positively with level of engagement, whereas number of law and policy authors was fairly constant across all depths of engagement. Surprisingly, level of policy engagement was negatively correlated with the number of citations an article subsequently received. We offer possible explanations for these results and thoughts for authors, editors, and research institutions interested in facilitating robust engagement of policy in scientific writing."
https://openalex.org/W2966246689,"Objective In addition to rhinoscopy, computed tomography of paranasal sinuses (CT) may be performed on patients with primary unknown cause of severe epistaxis (SE) or recurrent epistaxis (RE) to further assess the potential cause of bleeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate CT findings during the work-up of intractable epistaxis patients. Methods 6937 patients were treated in our emergency department with acute epistaxis between 2009–2018. 304/6937 patients underwent CT and rhinoscopy due to intractable SE or RE. 33 patients presented with head trauma prior to epistaxis and were excluded from the final analysis. In 271 cases the primary causes of SE (n = 252) or RE (n = 19) remained unknown. Two observers retrospectively evaluated CT scans for potential sources of epistaxis. Disagreement was settled by consensus. CT and rhinoscopy findings were compared. Results In 247/271 (91.1%) SE patients no related pathology was found on CT. A possible cause for epistaxis was found in all RE patients, but only in 5/252 (1.9%) patients with SE. Most tumours (10/11) and inflammatory conditions (9/10) were found in patients with RE. In three SE cases, a tumour was suspected on CT, from which two suspicions were refuted during rhinoscopy. CT revealed 10 cases of inflammatory conditions of the sinus and anatomical variant as potential cause of bleeding. Conclusion For patients with unknown causes of epistaxis, supplementary CT imaging may be a useful diagnostic add-on to rhinoscopy in the event of RE, tumour suspicion or inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. However, in most cases of first-time SE, CT does not necessarily add to the diagnosis. In these cases, the marginal benefit of CT needs to be weighed carefully against its risks."
https://openalex.org/W2964983766,"Previous research has suggested an association between antidepressants use and clinical restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients, but there has never been a single study investigating the risk of RLS in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients treated with antidepressants. Hence, we aimed to explore the association between IBS and RLS and to examine the risk of RLS in IBS patients treated with antidepressants. With the use of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, 27,437 adults aged ≥ 20 years with newly diagnosed IBS (ICD-9-CM Code 564.1) and gender- and age-matched 54,874 controls without IBS were enrolled between 2000 and 2012. All patients were followed-up until RLS diagnosis, withdrawal from the National Health Insurance program, or end of 2013. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of RLS. RLS was more prevalent in IBS patients than in the non-IBS group (7.57 versus 3.36 per 10,000 person-years), with an increased risk of RLS (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.52-2.40). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified older age (age, 51-65 years; aHR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.09-2.56; and age > 65; aHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.02-2.48), hypothyroidism (aHR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.92-9.37), CAD (aHR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.17-2.48), and depression (aHR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.14-4.64) as independent RLS risk factors in IBS patients. In addition, the male SSRIs users were associated with significantly higher risk of RLS (aHR, 3.05 95% CI, 1.34-6.92). Our study showed that the IBS group has higher risk of RLS. Moreover, SSRIs use may increase the risk of RLS in male IBS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2965299515,"Our purpose was to assess the differences in growth rates of multiple pulmonary metastatic nodules using three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) volumetry and propose a concept of CT spatial tumor heterogeneity.We manually measured the largest diameter of metastatic pulmonary nodules on chest CT scans, and calculated the 3D maximum diameter and the volume using a semi-automated 3D CT volumetry of each nodule. The tumor response was assessed according to the revised RECIST 1.1. We defined a nodule as an outlier based on 1.5 times growth during follow-up. The CT spatial tumor heterogeneity was statistically analyzed by the ""minimum combination t-test method"" devised in our study.On manual measurement, the tumor response category was stable disease (SD) in all 10 patients. Of them, total 155 metastatic nodules (4-52 nodules per patient) were segmented using the 3D CT volumetry. In the 3D maximum diameter, 9 patients had SD except for one patient with partial response in the two selected nodules; for the volume, all 10 patients were SD. For the 3D maximum diameter, six patients had at least one outlier; whereas five patients had the outlier on the volume measurement. Six patients were proven to have overall CT spatial tumor heterogeneity.The spatial tumor heterogeneity determined in a CT parametric approach could be statistically assessed. In patients with CT spatial heterogeneity, tumors with different growth rates may be neglected when the nodules are assessed according to the current guideline."
https://openalex.org/W2966154222,"Patients experiencing cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) often die or suffer from severe neurological impairment. Post resuscitation syndrome is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a major mediator of inflammation and TLR4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of post-resuscitation encephalopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TLR4 deficiency or inhibition can modulate survival and neurofunctional outcome after CA/CPR.Following intubation and central venous cannulation, CA was induced in wild type (C57Bl/6J, n = 38), TLR4 deficient (TLR4-/-, n = 37) and TLR4 antibody treated mice (5mg/kg MTS510, n = 15) by high potassium. After 10min, CPR was performed using a modified sewing machine until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Cytokines and cerebral TNFalpha levels were measured 8h after CA/CPR. Survival, early neurological recovery, locomotion, spatial learning and memory were assessed over a period of 28 days.Following CA/CPR, all mice exhibited ROSC and 31.5% of wild type mice survived until day 28. Compared to wild type mice, neither TLR4-/- nor MTS510 treated wild type mice had statistically significant altered survival following CA/CPR (51.3 and 26.7%, P = 0.104 and P = 0.423 vs. WT, respectively). Antibody-treated but not TLR4-/- mice had higher IL-1β and IL-6 levels and TLR4-/- mice had higher IL-10 and cerebral TNFalpha levels. No differences existed between mice of all groups in early neurological recovery, locomotion, spatial learning ability or remembrance.Therapeutic strategies targeting TLR4 may not be suitable for the reduction of mortality or neurofunctional impairment after CA/CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2966687272,"Background In Ecological models, physical environments can be important determinants of transport-related walking. With repeated exposure to the same environment, learning of a linkage between the cues in the environment and walking should occur. Subsequent encounters with the cues can prompt the behaviour relatively automatically. No studies have experimentally tested the potential learning of this linkage between cues and behaviour. Choices between stairs and escalators in public access settings were employed to test this premise for transport-related walking. Methods Three studies investigated the effects of visual cues on stair/escalator choices (combined n = 115,062). In quasi-experimental, interrupted time-series designs, observers audited choices in public access settings. Design alone phases with art or coloured backgrounds were compared with design plus message phases in which verbal health promotion messages were superimposed on the visual cues. Analyses used bootstrapped logistic regression. Results In initial studies, the design alone phases had no effect whereas subsequent design plus message phases reduced escalator choice. In two further studies, a 5–6 week design plus message phase that reduced escalator choice preceded a design alone phase. The visual background behind the successful health promotion message was reintroduced four weeks after the intervention was removed. The visual cue of design alone reduced escalator choice after it had been paired with the verbal health promotion message. There were no differences between art and coloured backgrounds. Conclusion These studies demonstrate for the first time a learnt linkage between transport-related walking and environmental cues. Discussion focuses on the mechanisms that may underlie this learning and cues in the environment that are relevant to transport-related walking."
https://openalex.org/W2964537783,"NAD kinase (NADK) is the sole enzyme that phosphorylates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) into NADP+/NADPH, which provides the chemical reducing power in anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways. While prokaryotes typically encode a single NADK, eukaryotes encode multiple NADKs. How these different NADK genes are all related to each other and those of prokaryotes is not known. Here we conduct phylogenetic analysis of NADK genes and identify major clade-defining patterns of NADK evolution. First, almost all eukaryotic NADK genes belong to one of two ancient eukaryotic sister clades corresponding to cytosolic (""cyto"") and mitochondrial (""mito"") clades. Secondly, we find that the cyto-clade NADK gene is duplicated in connection with loss of the mito-clade NADK gene in several eukaryotic clades or with acquisition of plastids in Archaeplastida. Thirdly, we find that horizontal gene transfers from proteobacteria have replaced mitochondrial NADK genes in only a few rare cases. Last, we find that the eukaryotic cyto and mito paralogs are unrelated to independent duplications that occurred in sporulating bacteria, once in mycelial Actinobacteria and once in aerobic endospore-forming Firmicutes. Altogether these findings show that the eukaryotic NADK gene repertoire is ancient and evolves episodically with major evolutionary transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2965762419,"This work presents a MATLAB-based software package for high-throughput microscopy image analysis development, making such development more accessible for a large user community. The toolbox provides a GUI and a number of analysis workflows, and can serve as a general framework designed to allow for easy extension. For a new application, only a minor part of the object-oriented code needs to be replaced by new components, making development efficient. This makes it possible to quickly develop solutions for analysis not available in existing tools. We show its use in making a tool for quantifying intracellular transport of internalized peptide-drug conjugates.
