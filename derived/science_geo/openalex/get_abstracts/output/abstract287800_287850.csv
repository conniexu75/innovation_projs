https://openalex.org/W2013291203,"Thermodynamic data are presented for hydrates of nitric acid: HNO(3).H(2)O, HNO(3).2H(2)O, HNO(3).3H(2)O, and a higher hydrate. Laboratory data indicate that nucleation and persistence of metastable HNO(3).2H(2)O may be favored in polar stratospheric clouds over the slightly more stable HNO(3).3H(2)O. Atmospheric observations indicate that some polar stratospheric clouds may be composed of HNO(3).2H(2)O and HNO(3).3H(2)O. Vapor transfer from HNO(3).2H(2)O to HNO(3).3H(2)O could be a key step in the sedimentation of HNO(3), which plays an important role in the depletion of polar ozone."
https://openalex.org/W2066732978,"A synthetic pathway is described to construct ""in bulk"" two-dimensional (2D) polymers shaped as molecular sheets. A chiral oligomeric precursor is used that contains two reactive sites, a polymerizable group at one terminus and a reactive stereogenic center near the middle of the molecule. The bulk reaction yields bilayer 2D polymers of molecular weight in the order of millions and a monodisperse thickness of 50.2 angstroms. The 2D molecular objects form through molecular recognition by the oligomers, which self-organize into layers that place the reactive groups within specific planes. The oligomers become catenated by two different stitching reactions involving the reactive sites. At room temperature, stacks of these molecular objects can organize as single crystals and at higher temperatures melt into smectic liquid crystals. Nonlinear optical experiments reveal that solid films containing the 2D polymers form structures that are thermally and temporally more stable than those containing analogous 1D polymers. This observation suggests that the transformation of common polymers from a 1D to a 2D architecture may produce generations of organic materials with improved properties."
https://openalex.org/W2026487640,"The colonization of Beringia appears closely linked to the arrival of the oldest firmly documented archeological tradition in mid-latitude North America (Paleoindian). The discovery of a Paleoindian complex in central Alaska, combined with the recent redating of the Bering Land Bridge and key archeological sites, suggests that Beringia was settled during the final Pleistocene interstadial (12,000 to 11,000 years before present). Its population expanded rapidly into other parts of the New World. Beringia probably was colonized in response to changes in climate and vegetation that occurred during this interstadial. Access to the Americas was controlled by Beringian environments and not by changing sea levels or continental ice masses."
https://openalex.org/W1987431483,"Radiocarbon data were applied to determine the rates of nitrate (NO[sub 3[minus]]) regeneration and oxygen (O[sub 2]) depletion in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean. A one-dimensinal, time-dependent diffusion model was used to caliabrate the age of the deep water. The combination of this model with a model of an organic carbon (C) flux, suggested how C fluxes into the basin might reflect primary productivity within the central Arctic Ocean. Errors in the age estimates of basin waters are corrected and suggestions made concerning where the basin-derived estimate of C flux might fit into the larger scheme of primary production in the Arctic Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2001405690,"The composition limits of Fe(x)O are sensitive to both pressure and temperature. Earlier studies have shown that Fe(x)O becomes highly nonstoichiometric when in equilibrium with metallic iron above 10 gigapascals, which is difficult to reconcile with available thermodynamic data. Experiments with a uniaxial split-sphere apparatus demonstrate that the iron content of Fe(x)O increases continuously at high pressure in excellent agreement with quantitative models and suggest that there is a discontinuity in the elastic properties of Fe(x)O above x = 0.95. On the basis of these results, it is inferred that the Earth's present lower mantle is not in equilibrium with metallic iron."

https://openalex.org/W1636175307,"At the annual meeting of the American Geophysics Union (AGU) in San Francisco on 7-11 December, catastrophes came in all sizes. On the molecular level, atmospheric chemists had news about the manmade compounds destroying the ozone shield-and for once the news was good. More earthshaking were signs of long-distance connections among earthquakes. And from farther afield came reports of odd-shaped debris from mini-planet collisions."
