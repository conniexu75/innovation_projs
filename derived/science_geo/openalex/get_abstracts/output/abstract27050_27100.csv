https://openalex.org/W2037626742,"T lymphocytes respond to foreign antigens both by producing protein effector molecules known as lymphokines and by multiplying. Complete activation requires two signaling events, one through the antigen-specific receptor and one through the receptor for a costimulatory molecule. In the absence of the latter signal, the T cell makes only a partial response and, more importantly, enters an unresponsive state known as clonal anergy in which the T cell is incapable of producing its own growth hormone, interleukin-2, on restimulation. Our current understanding at the molecular level of this modulatory process and its relevance to T cell tolerance are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2138616826,"Overlapping cDNA clones from the translocation breakpoint region (TBR) gene, recently discovered at the neurofibromatosis type 1 locus and found to be interrupted by deletions and a t(17;22) translocation, have been sequenced. A 4 kb sequence of the transcript of the TBR gene has been compared with sequences of genomic DNA, identifying a number of small exons. Identification of splice junctions and a large open reading frame indicates that the gene is oriented with its 5' end toward the centromere, in opposition to the three known active genes in the region. PCR amplification of a subset of the exons, followed by electrophoresis of denatured product on native gels, identified six variant conformers specific to NF1 patients, indicating base pair changes in the gene. Sequencing revealed that one mutant allele contains a T----C transition changing a leucine to a proline; another NF1 allele harbors a C----T transition changing an arginine to a stop codon. These results establish the TBR gene as the NF1 gene and provide a description of a major segment of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1970053578,"In invertebrate nervous systems, some long-lasting increases in synaptic efficacy result from changes in the presynaptic cell. In the vertebrate nervous system, the best understood long-lasting change in synaptic strength is long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here the process is initiated postsynaptically, but the site of the persistent change is unresolved. Single CA3 hippocampal pyramidal cells receive excitatory inputs from associational-commissural fibers and from the mossy fibers of dentate granule cells and both pathways exhibit LTP. Although the induction of associational-commissural LTP requires in the postsynaptic cell N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, membrane depolarization, and a rise in calcium, mossy fiber LTP does not. Paired-pulse facilitation, which is an index of increased transmitter release, is unaltered during associational-commissural LTP but is reduced during mossy fiber LTP. Thus, both the induction and the persistent change may be presynaptic in mossy fiber LTP but not in associational-commissural LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2002541688,"We have characterized circular DNA in mouse splenocytes treated with the mitogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and various cytokines, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Using probes of immunoglobulin heavy chain constant genes (CH), excision products of class switch recombination were identified. The majority of the clones contained the 3' portion of the switch mu (S mu) region and the 5' portion of other switch regions. Some clones contained 3'-S gamma sequences instead of 3'-S mu. This indicates that isotype switching may occur not only from C mu, but also from one of the C gamma genes to other CH genes further down-stream. In the presence of LPS, the cytokine TGF-beta enhanced the detection of 5'-S alpha-positive clones, while the lymphokine IL-4 enhanced 5'-S gamma 1 positives. The data support the notion that TGF-beta and IL-4 can direct isotype-specific class switching."

https://openalex.org/W2084959064,"The vertebrate retina contains two ultrastructurally distinct types of vesicle-containing synapses: conventional synapses, made predominantly by amacrine cells, and ribbon synapses, formed by photoreceptor and bipolar cells. To identify molecular differences between these synapse types, we have compared the distribution of the synapsins, a family of nerve terminal phosphoproteins, with that of synaptophysin (p38) and SV2, two intrinsic membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles. We report an absence of synapsin I and II immunoreactivity from all ribbon-containing nerve terminals. These include terminals of rod cells in developing and adult rat retina, rod and cone cells in monkey and salamander retinas, and rat bipolar cells. Furthermore, we show that synapsins I and II are differentially distributed among conventional synapses of amacrine cells. The absence of the synapsins from ribbon synapses suggests that vesicle clustering and mobilization in these terminals differ from that in conventional synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1524384907,"Digital imaging fluorescence microscopy of fura-2-loaded hepatocytes in primary culture has been used to examine the changes of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in response to receptor activation by alpha 1-adrenergic agonists and vasopressin at the subcellular level. Agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillations did not occur synchronously within the cell but originated from a specific region adjacent to the cell membrane and then propagated throughout the rest of the cell, with each oscillation within a series originating from the same locus. Furthermore, hormones acting through different receptors produced Ca2+ waves with similar rates of progress (20-25 microns.s-1) which originated from the same subcellular locus. For a given cell, the rate of progress and amplitude of the Ca2+ waves were independent of applied agonist concentration and were unaffected by depletion of extracellular Ca2+. The kinetics of Ca2+ increase at different points within the cell indicated that the Ca2+ waves were not driven by diffusion but were characteristic of a self-propagating mechanism. Significantly, when cells were treated with A1F-4 to directly activate the G-protein which couples receptor occupancy to [Ca2+]i mobilization, the origin and kinetics of the Ca2+ waves were identical to those observed with hormonal stimulation. It is proposed that the spatial organization of the intracellular Ca2+ release mechanisms may have significance in the regulation of the asymmetric metabolic functions of hepatocytes and other functionally polarized cells."

https://openalex.org/W1903435474,"The present study was designed to determine if diet fat-induced alteration in the fatty acid composition of the adipocyte plasma membrane alters insulin binding and the insulin responsiveness of glucose metabolism in control and diabetic states. Normal (control) and diabetic (streptozotocin-induced) rats were fed high fat semipurified diets providing a high or low polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid (P/S) ratio. Feeding a high P/S diet increased the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of major membrane phospholipids of the adipocyte plasma membrane from both normal and diabetic animals. The diabetic state was associated with an elevated content of linoleic acid and a reduced level of arachidonic acid consistent with reduced delta 6-desaturation. Feeding the high P/S diet to diabetic animals increased membrane linoleic acid content and prevented the decrease observed in the arachidonic acid of membrane phospholipids. The high P/S diet was associated with increased insulin binding in nondiabetic animals but did not change the amount of insulin bound by cells from diabetic animals. Significantly (p less than 0.05) increased rates of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and lipogenesis (glucose incorporation into lipids) were observed in control animals fed the high as compared to the low P/S diet. The rates of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, oxidation, and lipogenesis were lower (p less than 0.05) for cells from diabetic as compared to control animals. However, feeding a high P/S diet significantly improved rates for all three of these functions (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that diet-induced alterations in membrane composition may provide a mechanism for improving the cellular response to insulin in cells from diabetic animals."
https://openalex.org/W1515368893,"The synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 have been studied in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, the Hep G2 cells. Pulse-chase analysis showed that apoB-100 was not quantitatively recovered in the culture medium. To reveal the intracellular degradation of apoB-100 prior to secretion, cells were incubated with 1 microgram/ml Brefeldin A (BFA) which impeded protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and the fate of apoB-100 retained in the cells was traced at 37 degrees C. A significant amount of intracellular apoB-100 (40-60%/h) was degraded during the chase period, whereas apoA-1 remained intact. ApoB-100 degradation was temperature dependent, no degradation was observed below 20 degrees C. This degradation process was not inhibited by chloroquine, leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, suggesting that lysosomal proteases were not involved and that apoB-100 was degraded in a pre-Golgi compartment which is either part of, or closely related to, the ER. Preincubation of cells with low density lipoproteins (LDL) induced a 22-32% increase in the degradation of apoB-100. This result raised the possibility that secretion of apoB-100 might be regulated through the intracellular degradation of apoB-100. These results suggest the existence of the degradation pathway for apoB-100 in a pre-Golgi compartment and an unique regulatory mechanism for apoB-100 secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2007422047,"NSP1 is located at the nuclear periphery in yeast and is essential for cell growth. Employing immunoelectron microscopy on yeast cells, we show that NSP1 is located at the nuclear pores. The molecular analysis of the NSP1 protein points to a two domain model: a nonessential domain (the first 603 amino acids) composed of repetitive sequences common to other nuclear proteins and an essential, carboxy-terminal domain (residues 604-823) mediating the vital function of NSP1. The NSP1 carboxy-terminal domain, which shows a heptad repeat organization, affected the correct location of two nuclear proteins: site-specific amino acid substitutions within a predicted alpha-helical structure of this domain caused a temperature-sensitive growth arrest at 37 degrees C and the appearance of NSP1 and NOP1, a nucleolar protein, in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2005321694,"Loss of function mutations in genes of the achaete-scute complex (ASC) or in the gene vnd of D. melanogaster result in neural hypoplasia. Two types of defects contribute to the development of the neural hypoplasic pheno-type a lower than normal proportion of neuroblasts delaminate from the neuroectoderm, and there is abundant cell death in the neural primordium during later stages. In addition, we found that increasing the copy number of ASC wild-type alleles leads to effects opposite to those caused by their deletion. All of these results indicate that the function of these genes is required for the commitment of neuroectodermal cells as neuroblasts and that the loss of these genetic functions causes the cells either to take on an epidermal fate or to die."

https://openalex.org/W1553798208,"We have made a monoclonal antibody which specifically recognizes smg p25A among many ras p21/ras p21-like GTP-binding proteins thus far purified from bovine brain membranes. By use of this antibody, we have investigated the localization and subcellular distribution of smg p25A in rat brain by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and by immunoblotting. By light microscopic immunocytochemistry, specific immunoreactivity is widely distributed, most abundant in neuropil, weak in neuronal somata, and absent from white matter. By electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, intense labeling is demonstrated on most of the synapses and concentrated in the presynaptic area where synaptic vesicles are observed. Presynaptic plasma membranes are weakly labeled but mitochondria, postsynaptic plasma membranes, and postsynaptic densities are unlabeled. In subcellular fractionation analysis of cerebrum, about one-fifth of smg p25A is found in the soluble cytosol fraction and the rest is found in the particulate fraction. About half of the particulate-bound smg p25A is recovered in the P2 fraction containing synaptosomes, mitochondria, and myelin, among which a major portion of smg p25A is recovered in the synaptosomal fraction. In the synaptosomal fraction, smg p25A is concentrated about 8-fold in the fraction containing synaptic vesicles and about 3-fold in the fraction containing synaptic plasma membranes compared with the original homogenate. smg p25A is present at a low level in the fraction containing synaptosomal soluble substances but almost absent from the fractions containing intrasynaptosomal mitochondria or post-synaptic densities. These results suggest that smg p25A plays important roles in the regulation of synaptic functions such as exo-endocytotic recycling of synaptic vesicles during neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2143111728,"Protease nexin-2 (PN-2) is a protease inhibitor that is synthesized and secreted by a variety of extravascular cells including human fibroblasts. It forms sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with trypsin, the epidermal growth factor binding protein and the gamma-subunit of nerve growth factor. Recently we reported that PN-2 is the secreted form of the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) and is a potent inhibitor of chymotrypsin. Here we describe a two-step procedure to purify PN-2/APP using a monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity column. We also quantitated the protease inhibitory properties of purified PN-2/APP on a number of serine proteases. PN-2/APP was a potent inhibitor of coagulation factor XIa with a Ki = 2.9 x 10(-10). The inhibition of factor XIa by PN-2/APP was augmented by heparin and resulted in a Ki = 5.5 x 10(-11) M. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were also effectively inhibited with a Ki = 4.2 x 10(-10) and 1.6 x 10(-9), respectively. PN-2/APP also inhibited the epidermal growth factor binding protein, the gamma-subunit of nerve growth factor, and chymase and plasmin to a lesser extent. In view of recent findings that PN-2/APP is contained in alpha-granules of platelets and is secreted upon platelet activation, the potent inhibition of factor XIa suggests that PN-2/APP may play a regulatory role in the coagulation pathway at vascular wound sites. In addition, these studies define biochemical activities of PN-2/APP which may be involved in regulating proteases that lead to the generation and deposition of the beta-protein in neurodegenerative lesions associated with Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2122470243,"We screened a HIT (hamster insulin-secreting tumor) cell cDNA library constructed in lambda gt11 with a Go-specific oligonucleotide probe and isolated six recombinant phages. The inserts of these phages encoded two forms of alpha o, called here alpha o1 and alpha o2. The deduced amino acid sequence of alpha o1 is identical in all of its 354 amino acids to that reported previously for rat and bovine alpha o; that of alpha o2, also of 354 amino acids, is identical to alpha o1 up to and including amino acid 248 and differs thereafter in 26 amino acids. At the nucleotide level, alpha o1 and alpha o2 are identical up to and including the second base of the codon that specifies amino acid 243 and differs thereafter in 88 nucleotides of the remaining open reading frame and has no similarity to alpha o1 in its 3'-untranslated region. We propose that alpha o1 and alpha o2 result as a consequence of alternative splicing of a single alpha o transcript. Northern analysis with specifically designed oligonucleotides indicates that both forms of alpha o are expressed in normal tissues, e.g. brain. After in vitro transcription and translation, the peptides encoded in the alpha o1 and alpha o2 cDNAs could be ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin in the presence of added beta gamma dimers. The count of distinct G proteins keeps increasing."
https://openalex.org/W2141346516,"Mastoparan, a peptide toxin from wasp venom, stimulates guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by G proteins. To elucidate the site of mastoparan-G protein interaction, we utilized a polyclonal antibody (R16,17) directed against the carboxyl terminus of the Gi alpha subunit to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We investigated the ability of mastoparan to influence R16,17 antibody binding to G protein alpha subunits in a purified preparation of brain Gi and in neutrophil membrane extracts. Mastoparan antagonized the ability of R16,17 to detect G protein alpha subunits with an IC50 of 15 microM in the purified preparation and with an IC50 of 1 microM for the predominant G protein population in membrane extracts. This reduction was not seen when an unrelated peptide or a peptide of similar charge composition to mastoparan was used in place of mastoparan in the assay. Additionally, antibody R16,17 blocked up to 85% of mastoparan-stimulated GTPase activity. Taken together, these data indicate that the interaction of mastoparan with G protein depends in part on the carboxyl terminus of Gi alpha. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha markedly inhibited mastoparan-stimulated GTPase activity but only slightly attenuated the ability of mastoparan to recognize G protein. These data suggest that ribosylation inhibits mastoparan-induced G protein activation by a mechanism distinct from the ability of mastoparan to physically interact with G protein. Since mastoparan is thought to mimic hormone-liganded receptors, these findings may be applicable to the mechanism of receptor-Gi protein uncoupling that results from ADP-ribosylation of the G protein."
https://openalex.org/W1597652464,"The CD4 cell surface antigen is of interest as a marker of T lymphocytes that recognize foreign antigens in the context of MHC Class II antigen, as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and as a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) with four Ig-like domains present in the extracellular domain. In order to produce large amounts of soluble CD4 for x-ray crystallography and other molecular studies, a recently developed expression system based on selection via glutamine synthetase was used. Expression was attempted for rat CD4 corresponding to the full extracellular sequence (sCD4; domains 1-4), the NH2-terminal half (domains 1 and 2) and the first domain alone. Stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were obtained that expressed sCD4 and sCD4 (half) at typical maximal levels in spent tissue culture supernatant of greater than 80 and 25 mg/liter, respectively. Domain 1 alone was not expressed and introduction of a N-linked glycosylation site did not facilitate expression. The role of glycosylation in the expression of sCD4 was investigated by mutagenesis of the constructs to remove each of the two N-linked glycosylation sites in turn and both together. All three forms were expressed at 60-120 mg/liter. The sCD4 (half) was not expressed after deletion of its N-linked site. The disulfide bonds of sCD4 were determined to be within domains 1, 2, and 4 and isolation of glycopeptides showed that both N-linked sites were glycosylated. Analysis of the hydrodynamic properties of sCD4 suggested that the molecule adopted an extended conformation in solution rather than folding to form a compact structure like an Fab. The possibility of dimerisation of CD4 was investigated but sCD4 dimers were not seen at an affinity cut-off of about 4 x 10(5) M-1."
https://openalex.org/W1589875421,"Site-directed mutants of sperm whale myoglobin were prepared to probe the functional role of the highly conserved distal pocket valine residue, Val68(E11). This amino acid was replaced with Ala, Ile, and Phe to examine the effects of the side chain volume at position 68 on ligand binding. Three double mutants were also constructed in which the distal His64(E7) was replaced with Gly and Val68 was replaced with Ala, Ile, and Phe to determine the effects of size at position 68 in the absence of the distal histidine. Association and dissociation rate constants for O2, CO, and alkyl isocyanide binding were measured by stopped-flow rapid mixing, conventional flash, and laser photolysis techniques at pH 7, 20 degrees C. The association rate constants for the binding of all eight ligands to the single mutants decreased in the order Ala68 greater than Val68 (native) greater than Ile68 myoglobin, indicating that the 68(E11) residue is part of the overall kinetic barrier. A similar pattern was observed for the association constants of the double mutants: Gly64/Ala68 greater than Gly64/Val68 greater than Gly64/Ile68. Thus, increasing size of the E11 side chain inhibits the rate of ligand binding even in the absence of histidine at position 64. Substitution of Ala for Val68 had little effect on O2 affinity but did increase the affinities for CO and isocyanide binding. The affinities for all of the ligands were decreased for the Ile68 mutant. The ligand binding affinities for the Gly64/Ala68, Gly64/Val68, and Gly64/Ile68 myoglobins displayed an analogous trend to that of the single mutants, indicating that the equilibrium interactions between the position 64 and 68 side chains and the bound ligand are roughly additive. Both the association rate constants and dissociation rate constants for O2 and isocyanide binding were decreased for the Phe68 mutant myoglobin. These kinetic parameters result in little change in O2 affinity and an increase in isocyanide affinity, relative to the native protein. Thus, the large benzyl side chain of phenylalanine at position 68 inhibits the rate of ligand movement up to and away from the iron atom but not the final bound state."
https://openalex.org/W1480079437,"Incubation of rat liver microsomal fractions with arachidonic acid in the presence of NADPH results in the formation of three novel monohydroxylated fatty acid metabolites. Utilizing chromatographic and mass spectral techniques, these metabolites have been identified as 16-, 17-, and 18-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. The NADPH-dependent microsomal metabolism of arachidonic acid to 16-, 17-, 18-, and 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids is induced after animal treatment with beta-naphthoflavone. Reconstitution of the arachidonic acid oxygenase utilizing individual purified cytochrome P-450 enzymes demonstrates regioselectivity, controlled by the protein catalyst, for the hydroxylation of the sp3 carbon atoms adjacent to the methyl end of the fatty acid."
https://openalex.org/W1543832775,"Deglycosylated yeast invertase is irreversibly inactivated by conduritol B epoxide (CBE), an active-site-directed reagent. The inactivated enzyme contained 0.8 mol of CBE/mol of invertase monomer suggesting that the inactivation results from the modification of a single amino acid residue. Peptic digestion of [3H]CBE-labeled invertase followed by reverse phase column chromatography yielded two labeled peptides, both located at the amino-terminal end of the enzyme. Sequence analyses of these peptides revealed that Asp-23 is the modified residue. The role of Asp-23 in the catalytic process was investigated by changing it to Asn using site-directed mutagenesis of the SCU2 gene. The mutant enzyme was basically inactive, confirming a role for Asp-23 in the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1538959211,"A glutathione (GSH) S-transferase (GST), catalyzing the inactivation of sulfate esters as metabolites of carcinogenic arylmethanols, was isolated from the male Sprague-Dawley rat liver cytosol and purified to homogeneity in 12% yield with a purification factor of 901-fold. The purified GST was a homo-dimeric enzyme protein with subunit Mr 26,000 and pI 7.9 and designated as Yrs-Yrs because of its enzyme activity toward reactive sulfate esters. GST Yrs-Yrs could neither be retained on the S-hexylglutathione gel column nor showed any activity toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, 4-nitrobenzyl chloride, and 1,2-epoxy-3-(4'-nitrophenoxy)propane. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitro-benzene was a very poor substrate for this GST. 1-Menaphthyl sulfate was the best substrate for GST Yrs-Yrs among the examined mutagenic arylmethyl sulfates. The enzyme had higher activities toward ethacrynic acid and cumene hydroperoxide. N-terminal amino acid sequence of subunit Yrs, analyzed up to the 25th amino acid, had no homology with any of the known class alpha, mu, and pi enzymes of the Sprague-Dawley rat. Anti-Yrs-IgG raised against GST Yrs-Yrs showed no cross-reactivity with any of subunits Ya, Yc, Yb1, Yb2, and Yp. Anti-IgGs raised against Ya, Yc, Yb1, Yb2, and Yp also showed no cross-reactivity with GST Yrs-Yrs. The purified enzyme proved to differ evidently from the 12 known cytosolic GSTs in various tissues of the rat in all respects. Immunoblot analysis of various tissue cytosols of the male rat indicated that apparent concentrations of the GST Yrs-Yrs protein were in order of liver greater than testis greater than adrenal greater than kidney greater than lung greater than brain greater than skeletal muscle congruent to heart congruent to small intestine congruent to spleen congruent to skin congruent to 0."
https://openalex.org/W1563076040,"We have fused the ribosomal RNA promoter P1 from the rrnB gene of Escherichia coli to lacZ and examined its guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp)-dependent expression at different growth rates. The rrnB P1-lacZ fusion was constructed on plasmid vectors and then recombined into the chromosome of a delta lac relA1 strain close to the normal location of the rrnB locus and in the normal orientation, coincident with the direction of replication. A series of spoT strains differing in the severity of their SpoT defect were analyzed with respect to their growth characteristics and ppGpp metabolism. The spoT203 allele was introduced into the rrnB P1-lacZ fusion containing strain and used to manipulate the ppGpp concentration independently of the growth medium. 1) The levels of ppGpp during exponential growth are decreased in rich media due to a decreased activity of (p)ppGpp synthetase II (PSII). 2) The specific activity of rrn P1-directed beta-galactosidase was increased in a parabolic fashion with increasing growth rate. A theoretical analysis showed that this was to be expected since enzyme expression from a stringently controlled promoter is affected by changes in the growth rate both via the control of the promoter, and indirectly via the control of bulk mRNA synthesis. 3) The observer specific enzyme activities were converted into rrnB P1 promoter activities, given as lacZ transcription relative to the total rate of transcription. The rrn P1 promoter activity decreased exponentially with increasing cytoplasmic concentration of ppGpp, independent of whether a given level of ppGpp was achieved by using different growth media or by using a spoT allele. These results support two hypotheses: (i) that RNA polymerase is partitioned by ppGpp into two fractions with different abilities to initiate transcription at rrn P1 promoters; and (ii) that during exponential growth ppGpp is derived from ppGpp synthetase II (PSII). Together these hypotheses predict that the growth rate control of rRNA synthesis reflects a control of PSII activity which is regulated by the composition of the growth medium."
https://openalex.org/W1895697393,"The 53-kDa glycoprotein and sarcalumenin (160-kDa glycoprotein) were extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum with EGTA and purified by fractionation on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B. Sarcalumenin was shown to bind up to 400 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein at pH 7.5, which is equivalent to binding of approximately 35 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein. The apparent dissociation constant was 300 microM in the presence of 20 mM KCl and 600 microM in 150 mM KCl. The 53-kDa glycoprotein did not bind any Ca2+ under the conditions examined. Immunoblot analysis of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum subfractions demonstrated the presence of the two glycoproteins in both the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum and the terminal cisternae. Their concentrations were higher, however, in the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Comparative immunoelectron microscopic studies using monoclonal antibodies revealed a codistribution of the 53-kDa glycoprotein with the Ca2(+)-ATPase in all regions of the free sarcoplasmic reticulum. A similar distribution was found for sarcalumenin, although immunolabeling was much weaker. The colocalization of the 53-kDa glycoprotein and sarcalumenin with the Ca2(+)-ATPase and the Ca2+ binding properties of sarcalumenin suggest that the glycoproteins may be involved in the sequestration of Ca2+ in the nonjunctional regions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W3024129737,"The complete amino acid sequence of human retina and muscle aldose reductase was determined by nucleotide analysis of cDNA clones isolated using synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on partial amino acid sequences of purified human psoas muscle aldose reductase. The cDNA sequence differs substantially in the noncoding and coding regions of recently published sequences of this enzyme. The mRNA for aldose reductase was abundantly expressed in HeLa cells, but only scarcely in a neuroblastoma cell line. Recombinant baculovirus containing one of the muscle cDNA clones was constructed and used to infect Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) cells. A prominent protein with an apparent molecular size of 36 kDa was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the culture medium as well as in the homogenate of SF9 cells after 2 days of infection. Culture medium or the supernatant fraction of cell homogenates containing this protein had high aldose reductase activity which showed characteristics of the reported human enzyme. These findings indicate that the amino acid sequence reported in this paper represents human retina and muscle aldose reductase and that functional human aldose reductase can be expressed in large amounts in a baculovirus expression system. The result should facilitate refined structural analysis and the development of new specific aldose reductase inhibitors for the treatment of diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W1525608770,"A lambda clone containing the entire gene and flanking sequences for a form of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGTr-2) that glucuronidates testosterone and the foreign compounds, 4-hydroxybiphenyl and chloramphenicol, has been isolated from a rat liver genomic library. Sequence analysis of this clone revealed that the UDPGTr-2 gene is approximately 12 kilobase pairs in length and consists of six exons. All introns were found to interrupt protein coding regions of the gene. Four transcriptional start sites have been identified and are located 34, 35, 38, and 39 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translation initiation site. The 5'-flanking region of the gene contains a TATA-like sequence, CATAAA, 22 bp from the first transcription start site, potential AP-1 and v-MYB binding sites, and four sequence motifs that have been found in genes that are expressed predominantly in the liver. A 323-bp fragment encompassing these elements was fused upstream in both orientations to the coding sequence of placental alkaline phosphatase to assay promoter activity. Transient transfection of various cultured cell lines with the chimeric DNA demonstrated that this fragment, in the correct orientation, was able to function as an efficient promoter in the rat hepatoma cell lines Reuber H4-II-E and McA-RH7777. It was, however, inactive in hepatoma cell lines from two other species and in cell lines derived from other tissues. These results are consistent with the physiological expression of the rat UDPGTr-2 gene and suggest that the proximal 5'-flanking region of the gene may contain information which limits its expression to the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1496904265,"In vitro, metabolism of modified forms of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by macrophages via the acetyl-LDL receptor pathway promotes the massive cellular accumulation of lipid. It has been postulated that in vivo this contributes to foam cell formation in the atherosclerotic lesion. Recent studies have shown that arterial wall cells in vitro can secrete a number of cytokines, several of which have been reported to modulate macrophage cell function. Thus, cytokines have the potential to modulate the acetyl-LDL receptor pathway and to influence the rate of foam cell generation. To study the regulation of this pathway by cytokines, the effect of cytokines on the degradation of acetyl-LDL protein by mouse peritoneal macrophages was examined. Initially, supernatant from stimulated lymphocytes was used as a source of cytokines. Macrophages preincubated with supernatants obtained after the stimulation of T-cell helper type 1 (Th1) clone HDK-1 or BALB/c spleen cells degraded acetyl-LDL at a slower rate, whereas supernatant from stimulated T-cell helper type 2 (Th2) clone D-10 had no effect. Comparison of the lymphokine profiles showed that spleen and HDK-1 cells secreted several lymphokines in common including significant levels of interferon-gamma. Interferon-gamma was then directly shown to be inhibitory; an anti-interferon-gamma monoclonal antibody blocked the HDK-1-mediated inhibition by 70% and the addition of recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to macrophages inhibited the specific degradation of acetyl-LDL in a dose- and time-dependent manner with a maximum suppression to approximately 40% of control. The inhibition was not accompanied by an increase in the amount of cell-associated acetyl-LDL and was not due to cell death nor could it be accounted for by the presence of endotoxin. To study the mechanism of the inhibition, the effects of IFN-gamma on the itinerary of acetyl-LDL and its receptor were examined. IFN-gamma decreased specific acetyl-LDL binding only to a small degree, and the rate of lysosome-mediated degradation was not affected. The principal alteration was in the rate of transport to the lysosome which was markedly slowed. Since the receptors eventually returned to the surface to maintain a steady state, and there was not an increase in cell-associated lipoprotein, there must be other changes in the itinerary that were not identified with the techniques used. Thus, the receptor cycle is being regulated at a discrete point. IFN-gamma also suppressed the LDL receptor pathway in macrophages, but this pathway was not affected by IFN-gamma in mouse fibroblasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1534946515,"Cisplatin-resistant A2780DDP human ovarian carcinoma cells, 1 and 3 h following cisplatin treatment, display 3.2-6.1-fold enhancement of mRNA expression for oncogenes c-fos and c-H-ras and for enzymes necessary for DNA synthesis and repair. In contrast, c-myc mRNA was partially decreased. Increased transcription for the aforementioned genes accounts for the higher levels of mRNA since the enhancement is susceptible to actinomycin D pretreatment. Cyclosporin A (CSA) has been shown to reverse resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents. An 18-h treatment with CSA yielded a 6-fold improved sensitivity to cisplatin in A2780DDP cells. When A2780DDP cells are pretreated with CSA followed by cisplatin, there is no increase in mRNA for c-fos and c-H-ras and the genes for thymidine synthesis and DNA repair. Their expression approaches the levels demonstrated in A2780S cells. In contrast, c-myc mRNA was elevated 7.4-fold in the presence of CSA in A2780DDP cells. Long term weekly exposures of A2780DDP cells to CSA resulted in the evolution of a revertant cell line, A2780DDP/CSA, with decreased c-fos and dTMP synthase mRNA. Thus, cisplatin treatment in A2780DDP cells differentially induces expression of certain nuclear oncogenes (c-fos/c-myc), as well as genes possibly involved in the repair of cisplatin-mediated DNA damage, an induction suppressed by CSA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1550153447,"Type VII collagen is a major component of anchoring fibrils, which are 800-nm-long centrosymmetrically cross-banded fibrils that are believed to secure the attachment of certain epithelial basement membranes to the underlying stromal matrix. The ultrastructure of the anchoring fibrils is highly variable, suggesting that the fibrils are flexible. Flexibility measurements along the length of the triple-helical domain of type VII procollagen indicate that major flexible sites correlate well with known discontinuities in the (Gly-X-Y)n repeating sequence. Therefore, the helical disruptions may account for the tortuous shapes of anchoring fibrils observed ultrastructurally. The centrosymmetrical banding pattern observed for anchoring fibrils results from the unstaggered lateral packing of antiparallel type VII collagen dimers that form these structures. This antiparallel arrangement is specified by disulfide bonds formed at the margins of a 60-nm overlap of the amino termini. As long as these disulfide bonds remain intact, they protect the amino-terminal overlapping triple helices from collagenase digestion. This disulfide-bonded pair of triple helices is termed C-1. Large nonhelical domains (NC-1) extend from both ends of the anchoring fibrils and are believed to interact with the basement membrane or with anchoring plaques. Rotary shadowing of the NC-1 domains showed trident-like shapes, suggesting that a single alpha-chain contributed the structure of each arm and that the three arms were extended. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of NC-1 domains independently confirm these suggestions and imply that the arms of NC-1 domains are identical and individually capable of interactions with basement membrane components, potentially allowing trivalent interaction of type VII collagen with various macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1657254835,"beta-N-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) reacts with dissolved carbon dioxide to form two carbamate compounds at physiological pH, temperature and bicarbonate concentration. The reversible reactions of BMAA with dissolved carbon dioxide were monitored by 13C NMR. At 37 degrees C and pH 7.4, the fraction of BMAA existing as the alpha-N-carboxy adduct is 0.22 while the fraction of BMAA existing as the beta-N-carboxy adduct is 0.09. Although both adducts could be implicated in the bicarbonate-dependent neurotoxicity of BMAA (Weiss, J. H., and Choi, D. W. (1988) Science 241, 973-975; Mroz, E. A., Weiss, J. W., and Choi, D. W. (1989) Science 243, 1613), the beta-N-carboxy adduct shares structural characteristics with the appropriate endogenous ligand, glutamic acid. Analogously, the GABA-mimetic properties of ethylenediamine have been attributed to a carbamate adduct, ethylenediamine monocarbamate (Kerr, D. I. B., and Ong, J. (1987) Br. J. Pharmacol. 90, 763-769). Using the same method, we were able to detect directly and quantify the formation of this carbamate under physiological conditions. Information on the carbamate equilibria of these compounds is essential in order to address questions of their neuroactive potency."
https://openalex.org/W1547049402,"In H4IIE rat hepatoma cells insulin interacts with its receptors to induce DNA synthesis and promote cell division. However, the postreceptor events that lead to DNA synthesis and cell division have not been well characterized. Previous studies indicate that insulin can regulate the expression of several genes in H4 cells. One of these genes is the proto-oncogene c-fos, a cellular gene whose deregulation has been implicated in the process of cellular differentiation and division. In the present work insulin is shown to regulate cellular c-fos mRNA accumulation and the transcription rate of the c-fos gene. Insulin caused a rapid, dose-dependent increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of c-fos mRNA which was maximal by 30 min. Preceding this, a more rapid 6-8 fold increase in transcription of the c-fos gene was observed. Induction of transcription was apparent following only 5 min of insulin addition. This is the most rapid effect of insulin yet demonstrated on the induction of gene expression. Protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide, anisomycin) also induced the transcription of the c-fos gene. However, they stimulated a much greater increase in transcription than did insulin, and followed a different time course of action. The addition of insulin in combination with a protein synthesis inhibitor resulted in no greater increase in c-fos transcription than did the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor alone. The nonadditivity of H4 cell c-fos gene expression may indicate a similar mode of action by insulin and protein synthesis inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1542651690,"Proteins can be post-translationally modified by ADP-ribose. Previously, two classes of ADP-ribosyl protein linkages have been detected in vivo which have chemical properties indistinguishable from ADP-ribosyl arginine and ADP-ribosyl glutamate or aspartate. Reported here is the detection of a third class of endogenous ADP-ribosyl protein linkage. This class is chemically indistinguishable from ADP-ribose linked to cysteine residues by a thioglycosidic bond. The distribution of ADP-ribosyl cysteine residues was studied in subcellular fractions of rat liver. Proteins modified on cysteine were detected only in the plasma membrane fraction. Pertussis toxin is known to disrupt signal transduction of ADP-ribosylation of cysteine residues of plasma membrane GTP binding proteins. The results described here raise the interesting possibility that the endogenous modification of plasma membrane protein cysteine residues may be involved in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W45292870,"Gunn rats lack UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) activity toward bilirubin. 4-Nitrophenol glucuronidation is mediated by several UDPGT isoforms that are distinct from bilirubin-UDPGT, one of which is induced after 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) administration in normal, but not in Gunn rats. In normal rats, 3-MC-inducible UDPGT mRNA concentration increased 15-fold in the liver and 3-fold in kidney after 3-MC (140 mg/kg) administration. Concentration of this mRNA is much lower in Gunn rat liver and kidney compared to normal. However, this mRNA was normally induced after 3-MC administration. By RNA blot hybridization, the mRNA in Gunn rat liver and kidney appeared to be of normal size. Nuclear run-on studies showed that the transcription rate for 3-MC-inducible UDPGT was 3-fold higher in Gunn rat liver and kidney than in normal and increased 3- to 5-fold after 3-MC administration. Immunotransblot studies revealed an Mr = 56,000 3-MC-inducible UDPGT in liver and kidney of normal, but not in Gunn rats. However, a new immunoreactive UDPGT band (Mr = 43,000) was present in Gunn, but not in normal rats. Cell-free translation of kidney mRNA from 3-MC-treated Gunn rats showed that the Mr = 43,000 UDPGT is synthesized as an Mr = 45,000 protein. Prior hybridization of the mRNA with an isoform-specific oligonucleotide spanning the initiation codon abolishes synthesis of this protein. These results suggest that a sequence abnormality in the 3-MC-inducible UDPGT mRNA in Gunn rats results in reduced mRNA concentration and synthesis of a truncated, enzymically inactive UDPGT."
https://openalex.org/W1599464007,"We have previously shown that IgM-Asn406, a mutant IgM which has asparagine in place of the serine which is normally found at position 406, also has an abnormally glycosylated mu-chain and is defective in complement-dependent cytolysis. Here we show by analyzing cyanogen bromide fragments from normal and mutant mu-chains that the site of abnormal glycosylation is at the neighboring position, Asn402. The cytolytic defect was shown to be due to impaired C1 binding. At physiological ionic strength, the C1 binding defect was estimated to be 12-fold, which correlates well with the measured defect in cytolytic activity; also, the severity of the defect in C1 binding by the mutant protein decreases with decreasing ionic strength. Kinetic studies showed that the difference in affinities is due to a proportional difference in the association rate for C1q. By comparing IgM made in the presence and absence of deoxymannojirimycin, we show further that the defect in cytolytic activity derives mostly from the abnormal oligosaccharide."

SPLN also interacts with sperm acrosomal and plasma membranes. On the basis of analysis of the primary structure of SPLN with respect to its relative hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, a region comprising of 13-amino acids, Pro-Lys-Leu-Leu-Glu-Thr-Phe-Leu-Ser-Lys-Trp-Ile-Gly, has been delineated. It is demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding to this 13-residue region inhibits growth of Escherichia coli like SPLN and also has the ability to lyse red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541441356,"The active form of protein B2, the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, contains a binuclear ferric center and a free radical localized to tyrosine 122 of the polypeptide chain. MetB2 is an inactive form that lacks the tyrosine radical but retains the Fe(III) center. We earlier reported (Fontecave, M., Eliasson, R., and Reichard, P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9164-9170) that enzymes from E. coli interconvert B2 and metB2, possibly as part of a regulatory mechanism. Introduction of the tyrosyl radical into metB2 occurred in two steps: first, the Fe(III) center was to Fe(II), generating reduced B2; next oxygen regenerated non-enzymatically both Fe(III) and the tyrosyl radical. Here we demonstrate that dithiothreitol (DTT) between pH 8 and 9.5 also slowly converts metB2 to B2 in the presence of oxygen. Also in this case the reaction occurs stepwise with B2 as an intermediate. DTT reduces Fe(III) of both metB2 and B2. In the latter case this reaction is accompanied by the immediate loss of the tyrosyl radical. Our results indicate that the tyrosyl radical can exist only in the presence of an intact Fe(III) center. In B2 iron is loosely bound to the protein, dissociates on standing and is readily removed by chelating agents. Binding decreases at higher pH. Loss of iron from B2 explains why ferrous iron stimulates and iron chelators inhibit reactivation of metB2. We propose that the reactivation of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase by DTT (Thelander, M., Graslund, A., and Thelander, L. (1983) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 110, 859-865) may proceed via a mechanism similar to the one found here for E. coli protein B2."
https://openalex.org/W1567327133,"In rat aortic smooth muscle cells, vasopressin (AVP) induces prostacyclin (PGI2) production, probably as the consequence of phospholipase C activation. Our study analyzes the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation on AVP-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]c), and PGI2 production. PMA rapidly decreased PKC activity in the cytosol of smooth muscle cells, while increasing it transiently in the membranes with a maximum around 20 min. Prior exposure of the cells to PMA resulted in a transient inhibition of both AVP-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation and [Ca2+]c rise. This was inversely correlated with membraneous PKC activity and partially reversed by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine. In contrast, pretreating the cells with PMA markedly potentiated A23187 or AVP-induced PGI2 production. Under those conditions, AVP-induced PGI2 production did not correlate either with PMA-induced membranous PKC activity or with AVP-induced PLC activation. However, this potentiating effect of PMA was reversed by staurosporine and was not mimicked by the 4 alpha-phorbol, an inactive analogue of PMA. Thus, the possibility is raised that, while inhibiting AVP-induced PLC activation, PMA-induced PKC activation increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the cellular signaling system leading to PGI2 production."
https://openalex.org/W1591198324,"We investigated the role of intracellular [Ca2+] in mediating the independent signal transduction pathways leading to induction of VL30 RNA expression by multiple agonists in the Rat-1-derived RVL-3 cell line. This cell line contains a single integrated VL30 element, and displays a rapid transcriptional activation of VL30 following stimulation by epidermal growth factor, endothelin, or the phorbol ester tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (Rodland, K. D., Brown, A. M. C., and Magun, B. E. (1987) M. Cell. Biol. 7, 2296-2298). Neither epidermal growth factor nor endothelin is dependent upon protein kinase C for activation of VL30 expression, as both of these agonists induce normal levels of VL30 RNA expression, even in cells which have been severely depleted of protein kinase C following chronic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate exposure. Induction of VL30 RNA expression by either endothelin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate was blocked by concomitant exposure of RVL-3 cells to the intracellular Ca2(+)-chelating agent 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid at a concentration sufficient to buffer intracellular [Ca2+] below 200 nM, and VL30 RNA was induced by the application of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 in the absence of agonist. Normal levels of VL30 expression in response to epidermal growth factor were observed at 165 nM [Ca2+], but were significantly inhibited at 115 nM [Ca2+]. Both the protein kinase C-dependent and protein kinase C-independent pathways leading to VL30 transcription were dependent upon the presence of an intracellular [Ca2+] exceeding 115 nM. The dependence upon intracellular Ca2+ transients for transcriptional induction by endothelin appears to be a characteristic of VL30 expression, as 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid treatment did not prevent the endothelin-induced transcription of the protooncogenes c-jun and c-fos."
https://openalex.org/W1572778679,"Thrombin is a serine protease that plays an essential role in blood coagulation and also induces various responses in endothelial cells. The actions of thrombin on the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin are inhibited by peptides based on the amino acid sequence of hirudin, a natural anticoagulant from leeches. We show in these studies that the peptides Hir45-64 and sulfated Hir53-64 block the effects of thrombin on endothelial cells. These peptides inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the synthesis of prostaglandin I2 and platelet-activating factor, and the acquisition of an adhesive surface for leukocytes that occur in response to thrombin. These actions of the peptides occurred even though the catalytic site of thrombin was not blocked."

https://openalex.org/W1489314201,"The stoichiometry of DNA binding by the bacteriophage SP01-encoded type II DNA-binding protein TF1 has been determined. 3H-Labeled TF1 was allowed to bind to a 32P-labeled DNA fragment containing a TF1 binding site. Multiple TF1-DNA complexes were resolved from each other and from unbound DNA by native gel electrophoresis. DNA-protein complexes were cut from polyacrylamide gels, and the amounts of 3H and 32P contained in each slice were measured. A ratio of 1.12 +/- 0.06 TF1 dimer/DNA molecule was calculated for the fastest-migrating TF1-DNA complex. We conclude that TF1 has a DNA-binding unit of one dimer. More slowly migrating complexes are apparently formed by serial addition of single TF1 dimers."

https://openalex.org/W1606659017,"The contribution of Zn(II) toward the binding of bacteriophage T4 gene 32 single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein (gp32) has been examined by the use of two independent approaches. Studies carried out with successively longer oligonucleotides which have the general structure p(dT)n, where n is equal to 8, 16, 24, or 32 nucleotides, suggest that removal of Zn(II) decreases the cooperativity of binding by as much as 30-fold. Hence, whereas apo-gp32 and native gp32 have similar apparent affinities for the single-site lattice p(dT)8, native gp32 has an approximately 10-fold higher affinity compared to apo-gp32 for a two-site lattice, such as p(dT)16. In contrast to native gp32, where full cooperativity (in terms of the strength of a single gp32-gp32 interaction) is reached with only a two-site lattice, the cooperativity of apo-gp32 binding appears to increase approximately 4-fold upon going from a two- to a four-site lattice such as p(dT)32. The conclusion reached from these oligonucleotide studies agrees well with a series of titrations with polyribo(ethenoadenylic) acid, in 0.275-0.40 M NaCl. These latter studies indicate that the 6-38-fold higher affinity of native gp32 as compared to apo-gp32 for polyribo(ethenoadenylic) acid results primarily from the higher cooperativity of binding of native gp32. By stabilizing a specific subdomain within gp32 that is essential along with the NH2-terminal domain (residues 1-9), Zn(II) contributes from 20 to 50% of the free energy of cooperative gp32-gp32 interactions that occur along a polynucleotide lattice."
https://openalex.org/W1587422271,"We have shown that there is an inositol (Ins) lipid pool in cloned rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells that is hydrolyzed in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and an unresponsive pool. Because others have suggested that incorporation of [3H]Ins by base exchange may not occur uniformly into Ins lipids in other cell types, we established conditions using permeabilized cells under which labeling occurs by Ins-phosphatidylinositol (PI) exchange in the absence of de novo PI synthesis to further characterize these pools in GH3 cells. In permeabilized cells incubated in buffer containing 10 mM Mg2+ and 0.1 mM CMP, [3H]Ins incorporation into lipids occurred by base exchange only. This was so because: 1) [3H]Ins incorporation into lipids displayed properties similar to that for release of 3H-labeled Ins by unlabeled Ins from PI in cells prelabeled in situ prior to permeabilization; and 2) there was no change in PI mass under these conditions. In permeabilized cells incubated in buffer with 0.1 mM [3H]Ins for 60 min, incorporation was 0.61 +/- 0.05 nmol of [3H]Ins/10(6) permeabilized cells, which amounted to 35% of PI, while the level of PI, measured as nonradioactive phosphorus, was 94 +/- 8.0% of control. Permeabilized GH3 cells were responsive to TRH. In cells prelabeled in situ and then permeabilized, TRH stimulated an increase in 3H-labeled Ins phosphates (IPs) in 20 min which was 10% of 3H radioactivity initially present in lipids. This increase in 3H-labeled IPs was 6.3 times the 3H radioactivity present in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate prior to stimulation. When prelabeled cells were exchanged with unlabeled Ins after permeabilization there was only a 10-16% decrease in 3H-labeled IP accumulation stimulated by TRH even though 3H-labeled lipids decreased to 52% of control. TRH did not affect labeling by [3H]Ins-PI exchange. In cells labeled by base exchange after permeabilization TRH stimulated a very small increase in 3H-labeled IPs of only 0.21 +/- 0.02% of 3H-labeled lipids in 20 min or only 7% of the 3H radioactivity in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These data show that in permeabilized GH3 cells base exchange can occur in the absence of de novo PI synthesis and that lipids that are preferentially labeled by base exchange comprise a pool that is less responsive to TRH than total Ins lipids."

https://openalex.org/W83999324,"Changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) were used to study the interaction between mitogens in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) produced an increase in [Ca2+]i and markedly decreased the increases in [Ca2+]i caused by subsequent addition of bradykinin and vasopressin. If the order of the additions was reversed the [Ca2+]i response to PDGF was not inhibited by bradykinin or vasopressin. Inhibition of protein kinase C by staurosporine or chronic treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate prevented the inhibitory effect of PDGF on the [Ca2+]i response to vasopressin but not bradykinin. PDGF did not decrease the receptor binding of bradykinin and produced only a small decrease in the receptor binding of vasopressin. PDGF decreased the rise in [Ca2+]i caused by the Ca2+ ionophores 4-bromo-A23187 and ionomycin and by a membrane perturbing ether lipid, 1-octadecyl-2-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine, both in the presence and absence of external Ca2+. There was no change in cell 45Ca2+ influx caused by PDGF, vasopressin, or bradykinin. 45Ca2+ efflux from cells exposed to PDGF and vasopressin mirrored the changes in [Ca2+]i caused by the agents, that is, PDGF added after vasopressin produced a further increase in 45Ca2+ efflux but vasopressin did not increase 45Ca2+ efflux after PDGF. PDGF but not vasopressin caused an increase in the uptake of 45Ca2+ into an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive non-mitochondrial store in permeabilized cells. The results suggest that the decreased [Ca2+]i response to mitogens after PDGF represents an action of PDGF at a point beyond the release of intracellular Ca2+ and the influx of external Ca2+, caused by an increase in the rate of removal of cytoplasmic free Ca2+. This increased removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ by PDGF is not due to the increased export of Ca2+ from the cell but results from increased Ca2+ uptake into non-mitochondrial stores."
https://openalex.org/W1517067172,"In order to identify the regions of recombinant (r) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that mediate its kinetically relevant interaction with r-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (rPAI-1), we have determined the second-order association rate (k1) constants of domain-altered variants of tPA with rPAI-1, at 10 degrees C. With two-chain, wild-type recombinant tPA (tcwt-rtPA), obtained by expression of the human cDNA for tPA in five different cell systems (viz. insect cells, human kidney 293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, human melanoma cells, and mouse C127 cells), the average k1 was 1.45 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 (range, 1.34 10(7) M-1 s-1-1.68 x 10(7) M-1 s-1). Since this value was not significantly different for the different tcwt-rtPA preparations, it appears as though the nature of the glycosylation of tPA plays little role in its initial interaction with PAI-1. The k1 determined for tcwt-rtPA was slightly higher than that of 0.87 x 10(7) M-1 s-1, obtained for a similar inhibition of human urokinase by rPAI-1. The k1 value obtained for single-chain (sc) wt-rtPA was approximately 6-fold lower than that of the two-chain molecules, results consistent with previous conclusions on this matter. The k1 value for tcwt-rtPA was not influenced by the presence of epsilon-aminocaproic acid, suggesting that the lysine-binding site associated with the kringle 2 (K2) region of tPA does not modulate the rate of its initial interaction with rPAI-1. Removal of the K2 domain from tPA, by recombinant DNA technology, results in a protein, F-E-K1-P (tc-r delta K2-tPA), containing only the finger (F), growth factor (E), kringle 1 (K1), and serine protease (P) domains. This variant protein was more rapidly inhibited by rPAI-1 (k1 = 3.00 x 10(7) M-1 s-1) than its wild-type counterparts. Deletion of both the K1 and K2 domains resulted in a variant molecule, F-E-P (tc-r delta K1 delta K2-tPA), that was slightly more rapidly inhibited by rPAI-1 (k1 = 2.01 x 10(7) M-1 s-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
