One trial with a given meat and lithium is sufficient to establish a strong aversion which inhibits eating the flesh of that prey. One or two trials with a given flesh (lamb or rabbit) specifically suppresses the attack upon the averted prey but leaves the coyote free to attack the alternative prey. A method of saving both prey and predator is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2091580804,"Tungsten carbide has been shown to be an effective catalyst for a number of reactions that are readily catalyzed by platinum, but not at all by tungsten, and it was speculated that this behavior is due to changes in the electron distribution when carbon is added to tungsten. A test of this hypothesis, made by measuring the valence band x-ray photoelectron spectrum of tungsten carbide and comparing it with the spectra of tungsten and platinum, shows that, near the Fermi level, the electronic density of states of tungsten carbide more nearly resembles that of platinum than that of tungsten."

The spacing is 0.004 to 0.015 angstrom smaller in porcellanite than in associated chert, probably because the cristobalite of porcellanite formed later than that of chert."
https://openalex.org/W2077604462,"Verbal free recall of lists of 20 items increased on repeated recall attempts, without any further presentation of each word after it had been recalled just once. Such restricted presentation resulted in long-term storage and retention of almost all 20 items, as shown by their eventual spontaneous retrieval without further presentation. Most items that failed to be recalled were retrieved again later without any further presentation, indicating that such failures represent retrieval failures rather than loss from storage and that free recall verbal learning requires retrieval from long-term storage."

https://openalex.org/W2076779093,"An infrared heterodyne radiometer with a spectral resolution of 0.04 reciprocal centimeters has been used to remotely detect samples of ozone, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and ethylene at room temperature, and samples of nitric oxide at 390K. Each gas was observed in a background of nitrogen or oxygen at atmospheric pressure. Sensitivities to some of these gases are adequate for detection of ambient concentrations as low as a few parts per billion."
https://openalex.org/W2050854067,"Solutions of RhCl(3).xH(2)O in ethanol and Ru(NO)(2)[P(C(6)H(5))(3)](2) in benzene catalyze the reduction of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide concomitant with the oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The reaction, which is followed by gas chromatography and by the decrease in pressure of the system, proceeds to 47 percent conversion of the reactants after 63 hours."
https://openalex.org/W2012435328,"Spherulites occur in the metamict matrix of the rare earth AB(2)A(6-) type niobium-tantalum-titanium oxide, polycrase. Microprobe analyses show that the spherulites are similar in composition to the metamict polycrase except for a fivefold increase in calcium oxide. X-ray examination suggests that the spherulites are a titanium-rich rare earth fersmite."

https://openalex.org/W2058135174,The entropy of disorder of the idealized crystal structure of monoclinic sulfur at high temperatures is equal to the extra entropy change in the lambda-type (second order transformation type) heat capacity anomaly found at 198 degrees K. The extrapolated entropy is zero at 0 degrees K. The partially disordered crystal structure gradually becomes ordered as the temperature is lowered.
https://openalex.org/W1974332718,"Changes in chemical oxidation states in alloys and at solid-solid interfaces were monitored by using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. For an oxidized Nichrome surface, the chromium component was selectively converted to chromic oxide while nickel remained in the metallic state. When this surface was overlaid with a 20-angstrom-thick aluminum film, the chromic oxide was reduced to chromium and the aluminum was oxidized to aluminum oxide in a reaction zone consisting of no more than 10 angstroms of the interface. This scheme appeared general for solid-solid contacts and was predicted, to a first approximation, by bulk thermodynamic free energies."

https://openalex.org/W2022523891,"A few comments are in order concerning Charles C. Price's letter (24 Oct., p. 4ll), which promoted participation in the First International Peace Week of Scientists. Implicit
in this letter and underlying the staging of this event is the idea that peace, in and of itself, is to be desired, and that militarization, termed the arms race, is to be deplored. I would like to dispute this."
