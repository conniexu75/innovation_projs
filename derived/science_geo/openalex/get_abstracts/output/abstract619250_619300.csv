https://openalex.org/W2892968638,"A wild tomato species is domesticated by targeted CRISPR–Cas9 editing of just six genes. Breeding of crops over millennia for yield and productivity1 has led to reduced genetic diversity. As a result, beneficial traits of wild species, such as disease resistance and stress tolerance, have been lost2. We devised a CRISPR–Cas9 genome engineering strategy to combine agronomically desirable traits with useful traits present in wild lines. We report that editing of six loci that are important for yield and productivity in present-day tomato crop lines enabled de novo domestication of wild Solanum pimpinellifolium. Engineered S. pimpinellifolium morphology was altered, together with the size, number and nutritional value of the fruits. Compared with the wild parent, our engineered lines have a threefold increase in fruit size and a tenfold increase in fruit number. Notably, fruit lycopene accumulation is improved by 500% compared with the widely cultivated S. lycopersicum. Our results pave the way for molecular breeding programs to exploit the genetic diversity present in wild plants."

But the extent of heterogeneity within the colonic mesenchyme in these processes remains unknown. Using unbiased single-cell profiling of over 16,500 colonic mesenchymal cells, we reveal four subsets of fibroblasts expressing divergent transcriptional regulators and functional pathways, in addition to pericytes and myofibroblasts. We identified a niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3 (CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity in vivo.

Our work defines how the colonic mesenchyme remodels to fuel inflammation and barrier dysfunction in IBD. Mesenchymal cells of the intestinal lamina propria are a heterogeneous population of non-hematopoietic, non-epithelial cell types that play instrumental roles in innate immunity, immune regulation, and epithelial barrier maintenance (Nowarski et al., 2017Nowarski R. Jackson R. Flavell R.A. The stromal intervention: Regulation of immunity and inflammation at the epithelial-mesenchymal barrier.Cell. 2017; 168: 362-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Their functions are impaired in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where they shape the inflammatory milieu, development of bowel strictures, and inflammation-associated cancers via poorly defined pathways. The major intestinal tissue stromal cell subsets are classified as fibroblasts, α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-expressing myofibroblasts, and perivascular pericytes (Roulis and Flavell, 2016Roulis M. Flavell R.A. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts of the intestinal lamina propria in physiology and disease.Differentiation. 2016; 92: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, these cells express overlapping marker genes, which has prevented delineating cell-type-specific functions and ontogeny at a genetic level. We also do not know the specific mechanisms by which colonic mesenchymal cells direct intestinal epithelial cell function. The intestinal epithelium comprises a monolayer of polarized columnar cells organized along the crypt-villus axis. Intestinal stem cells reside at the base of crypts and receive constant nourishment from the surrounding niche for maintenance, self-renewal, and differentiation. Intestinal mesenchymal cells help maintain the stem cell niche by producing Wnt agonists and antagonists, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and other molecules such as Noggin, Chordin, and R-spondins. Deregulated expression of these genes leads to colitis, impaired intestinal wound healing, or colon tumorigenesis (Koch, 2017Koch S. Extrinsic control of Wnt signaling in the intestine.Differentiation. 2017; 97: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although these individual molecules play defined roles in barrier maintenance, the originating cell types remain undefined. Colonic mesenchymal cells also influence intestinal mucosal immune cell function during development, inflammation, and tissue repair, shifting between immunosuppressive or pro-inflammatory states to determine the function of immune cells populating connective tissue (Bernardo and Fibbe, 2013Bernardo M.E. Fibbe W.E. Mesenchymal stromal cells: Sensors and switchers of inflammation.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 392-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Despite the growing recognition that colonic mesenchyme signals maintain epithelial barrier integrity and immune homeostasis, the identity of intestine-specific mesenchymal subtypes and the molecular attributes that regulate niche maintenance or disease remodeling have not so far been described. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool to define the heterogeneity of poorly classified tissue populations and disease-associated cell states. Using scRNA-seq, we identified and characterized colonic mesenchymal subsets including those that are key mediators of epithelial cell self-renewal and immune homeostasis and defined their functional contribution to inflammation in IBD patients and a murine colitis model. Colonic tissue was obtained from healthy individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy or newly diagnosed IBD patients who had not received immunotherapies to avoid the effects of drug treatment on observed molecular signatures. We applied a negative selection protocol to facilitate unbiased capture of a cross-section of mesenchymal cells. We dissociated whole biopsies into single cells using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) microbeads to deplete EPCAM+, CD45+, and CD235a+ cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed depleted epithelial and immune cells and enriched THY1 (CD90), a known stromal marker (Figure 1A). We then performed scRNA-seq on mesenchymal cells from 5 healthy individuals and 5 newly diagnosed IBD patients (Table S1). During our initial examination, we surveyed 301 cells using the C1 Fluidigm platform. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed five distinct cell types (Figures S1A and S1D), each exhibiting similarly high expression of pan-fibroblast markers, such as the intermediate fiber vimentin and collagen types 1 and 3 (VIM, COL1A2, COL3A1) (Figure S1B). We designated one cluster myofibroblasts (MFs) based on high expression of contractile genes (e.g., MYH11 and ACTG2), while the remaining clusters designated stromal 1–4 (hereafter S1–S4) expressed fibroblast-associated but not contractile genes and showed dissimilar transcriptional profiles and ontology enrichment (Figures S1C and S1E; Table S2). We then cataloged 4,378 human colonic mesenchymal cells from healthy individuals using droplet based 10x Genomics scRNA-seq to obtain a higher-resolution map. The results using this approach complemented those using the C1 Fluidigm platform. Clustering detected 11 distinct cell clusters consisting of as few as 41 cells (S4) to 1,920 cells (S1) per cluster (Figure 1B). Two clusters of endothelial cells showed marked expression of PECAM1, glial cells showed S100B expression, pericytes expressed RGS5, and plasma cells were identified by SDC1 expression. We identified the remaining clusters as counterparts to fibroblast-like cell types revealed by our initial survey (Figures S1G, 1B, and 1C). Myofibroblasts were defined by gene ontology (GO) terms “muscle system process” and “muscle contraction” (Figure S2A), as well as expression of contractile genes, α-SMA (ACTA2) and transcription factors not previously linked to myofibroblasts, which may enable future explorations of ontogeny of these cells (Figure 1Dv). S1 GO enrichment terms included “positive regulation of locomotion,” “response to tumor necrosis factor,” and “ERK1 and ERK2 cascade” (Figure S2B). Examples of preferentially induced genes included APOE, CCL8, FABP5, ADAMDEC1 (Figure 1Di). Stromal sub-populations showed enrichment for genes annotated with “extracellular matrix”-related GO terms (Figure S2), a central fibroblast function, but they differed in the expression of specific forms of collagen. S1 enriched for non-fibrillar collagens (COL14A1, COL15A) and elastic fibers (FBLN1, FBLN2, FBLN5, EFEMP1, FN1), while S2 showed specific expression of sheet collagens (COL4A5, COL4A6) that are key constituents of the epithelial basement membrane, which suggests S2 may play a role in epithelial barrier maintenance (Figure S1C; Table S3). S2, marked by expression of the transcription factor SOX6 (Figure 1Dii), consisted of two similar sub-clusters designated 2a and 2b (Figure 1B). S2 had high expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily ligands (BMP2 and BMP5), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A and WNT5B), and the secreted Wnt antagonist FRZB (Figures 1Dii and S1C). WNT5A is essential for epithelial reconstitution after injury via a mechanism that involves potentiation of TGF signaling (Miyoshi et al., 2012Miyoshi H. Ajima R. Luo C.T. Yamaguchi T.P. Stappenbeck T.S. Wnt5a potentiates TGF-β signaling to promote colonic crypt regeneration after tissue injury.Science. 2012; 338: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). S2 also expressed high levels of periostin (POSTN) (Figure 1D, ii), which is essential for tissue repair but can also promote tumorigenesis (Bao et al., 2004Bao S. Ouyang G. Bai X. Huang Z. Ma C. Liu M. Shao R. Anderson R.M. Rich J.N. Wang X.F. Periostin potently promotes metastatic growth of colon cancer by augmenting cell survival via the Akt/PKB pathway.Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The combination of factors secreted by S2 indicates it may contribute to epithelial stem cell proliferation and differentiation and constitute an important mesenchymal niche cell. S3 GO enrichment included “supramolecular fiber organization” and “extracellular cluster organization’ (Figures S2D and 1Diii), whereas S4, which consisted of very few cells in healthy mesenchyme, showed enriched GO terms, including “cytokine signaling pathway,” “positive regulation of cell adhesion,” and “T cell activation” (Figure S2E). We next sought to define the tissue distribution of these newly identified mesenchymal subsets using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and single-molecule in situ hybridization (sm-ISH). We detected S1 markers (ADAMDEC1, DCN, SLIT2, CXCL12) in mesenchymal cells distributed throughout the lamina propria, while S2 markers (F3 [CD142], WNT5A, WNT5B, BMP2, BMP5, FRZB, POSTN, HSD17B2) were restricted to a smaller sub-population in close proximity to the epithelial monolayer. This precise anatomical localization, in combination with their epithelial regeneration-associated gene expression profile, indicates a likely role for S2 in directing the function of epithelial progenitors and epithelial homeostasis (Figure 1E). We further validated the existence of these new populations by flow cytometry analysis of fibroblasts from healthy human colonic tissue. Here, we distinguished distinct populations of SOX6−ZEB2+/ZEB1−ZEB2+ S1 and SOX6+ZEB2−/ZEB1+ZEB2− S2 cells (Figure 1F). We quantified the spatial segregation of stromal subset markers by IHC and co-staining colonic tissue sections with antibodies detecting a key marker protein from each new subset together with CD45 to distinguish immune cells. Figure 1G shows distinct segregation of the three proteins marking the novel subsets from each other and immune cells in a quadruple stain in healthy human colonic tissue. We examined differentially expressed genes between S2a and S2b, the crypt niche population. 302 marker genes differentiated these closely related sub-clusters (Figure 1H; Table S4). Examples of genes segregating S2 into sub-clusters a and b included BMP7, WNT5a, CPM, PTX3, LTBP1, and GJA1 (Figure 1I). We further examined the S2a and S2b sub-clusters by comparing their over-represented GO terms in positive marker genes for S2a and S2b sub-clusters (Figure 1J). This analysis revealed S2a expressed genes with GO relating to “BMP signaling and response,” whereas S2b expressed factors relating to “response to wound healing” and “regulation of epithelial cell proliferation.” Overall, our data identified new and distinct colonic mesenchymal subsets with specific functional properties that exhibited unique marker gene expression and anatomical location within the lamina propria. In particular, we identified a putative intestinal crypt niche mesenchymal cell (S2a and S2b) hallmarked by gene expression required for epithelial progenitor cell function and proliferation. To uncover the role of our newly identified mesenchymal subsets in IBD, we investigated changes in their composition and gene expression at the single-cell level in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). scRNA-seq of UC colonic mesenchyme revealed 12 distinct clusters of cells. A random forest classifier trained using the data from healthy patients guided the identification of corresponding UC cell clusters. We readily identified the same clusters as detected in healthy mucosa, except an additional small cluster of pericytes (Figure 2A). A healthy and UC cluster marker gene overlap correlation heatmap showed major cell types were preserved in UC (Figure 2B). We identified changes in the proportions of various clusters including expansion of endothelial cells and pericytes. Within the stromal subsets, we observed expansion of S4 that was barely detectable in the healthy mesenchyme (Figure 2A). This finding is consistent with our preliminary data using the C1 Platform (Figures S1A and S1D; Table S5). We further explored the nature of S4. GO enrichment terms for this subset in UC included “response to tumor necrosis factor,” “positive regulation of leukocyte migration,” and “response to bacterium” (Figure 2C). Highly ranked S4 markers included fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-associated genes, lymphocyte trafficking cytokines (CCL19 and CCL21), T cell co-stimulatory TNF-superfamily ligand (TNFSF14/LIGHT), the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II invariant chain (CD74), the molecular chaperone clusterin (CLU), CD24, and interleukin-33 (IL-33) (Figures 2C and S1; Table S5). So, scRNA-seq identified expansion of a novel stromal population enriched for pro-inflammatory and FRC genes in UC. Next, we investigated whether we could detect S4 cells at the protein level in colonic tissue samples from IBD patients. We stained colonic cell suspensions derived from UC patients and healthy controls with antibodies to predicted S4 markers. Colonic stromal cells from active UC showed enriched S4 proteins CD74 and PDPN (Figure 2D, i). Cells expressing S4 markers CD74, CD24, and PDPN showed increased CCL19 and IL-33 expression (Figure 2D, ii). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the expansion of a FDCSPhigh, CD24high population of stromal cells in inflamed UC tissue (Figures 2E and S3). We also found increased FDCSP expression within the lamina propria of inflamed UC tissue sections by sm-ISH (Figure 2F). In addition to expansion of S4 in UC, we observed a decrease in SOX6+ S2 cells in biopsies from inflamed UC colonic tissue when compared to healthy controls (Figure 2G), also observed in our preliminary C1 data (Figure S1F). Taken together, these findings chart the nature of mesenchymal plasticity in human IBD, demonstrating dysregulation of the crypt niche S2 population, which presents a novel feature of barrier dysfunction in UC. Simultaneously, we observed the emergence of activated S4 equipped to mobilize the immune response and drive tertiary lymphoid follicle formation. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis is a commonly used colitis model that leads to a pro-inflammatory phenotype with parallels to human IBD. We predicted similar mesenchymal heterogeneity might exist in murine intestine in health and following DSS challenge. We examined this using the 10x Genomics platform. We divided male C57BL/6 mice into control and treatment groups and administered a DSS challenge (Figures S4A and S4B). Stromal cells were enriched from the entire colon by MACS depletion of epithelial and immune cells. Following control cell removal and quality control (QC), 7,171 single cells remained in the analysis (3,817 healthy, 3,354 DSS). Clustering cells from healthy mice revealed 13 distinct clusters (Figure 3A and 3C ). We readily identified clusters showing specific expression of epithelial (Epcam and Krt19), pericyte (Rgs5 and Pdgfrb), vascular endothelial (Pecam1 / Cd31), lymphatic endothelial (Lyve1), and glial (S100b and Gfap) and hematopoietic cell markers (Cd52 and Ptprc / Cd45) (Figure 3C). Cluster 2, a small cluster of 32 cells, expressed markers associated with enteric smooth muscle (Myh11 and Des) and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) (Kit and Ano1). Further examination of this cluster revealed its composition was two distinct sub-clusters consistent with ICCs and smooth muscle cells, respectively (Figure 3A). Other low-abundance clusters included enteric glial cells (14 cells) and pericytes (67 cells) (Figure 3A). The remaining 6 cell clusters (4–5, 10–13), comprising 3,391 cells or 89% of the dataset were fibroblast-like cells (FLCs) characterized by expression of the pan-fibroblast markers such as Dpt, Col6a2, and Col1a2 (Figure 3C). Clusters 4 and 5 also showed α-Sma expression, while only cluster 4 showed significant expression of smooth muscle myosin (Myh11) (Figure 3C). We readily identified these six populations as putative counterparts to the stromal cell populations in our human data by cluster marker expression (Table S6). Figure 3B shows a phylogenetic tree of healthy murine colonic mesenchymal clusters and Figure 3D differential GO enrichment between these clusters, showing divergent functional specialization. In addition, we observed GO enrichment for myofibroblasts, which enriched predominantly for contractile processes, while the S2 group enriched for TGF-β responses and BMP signaling. The enrichment for “ameboidal-type cell migration” seen in S1.1 and S1.3 may represent migratory properties of colonic stroma (Brown et al., 2007Brown S.L. Riehl T.E. Walker M.R. Geske M.J. Doherty J.M. Stenson W.F. Stappenbeck T.S. Myd88-dependent positioning of Ptgs2-expressing stromal cells maintains colonic epithelial proliferation during injury.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Murine clusters were assigned identifiers based on the human cluster to which they were most similar. In the case of S1, where a one-to-many relationship was observed, decimal point identifiers were appended to denote sub-clusters. Murine cluster 11 overlapped with human S1 and S3 but showed a close phylogenetic relationship to the other S1 clusters, so it was termed S1.3 (Figure 3B). Overall, key subset-specific marker pairs identified from the human data demonstrated correlated expression in the mouse (Figure 3E). Murine S2 markers localized to the same peri-epithelial anatomical location as their human counterparts (Figure 3F). We examined how expression of previously reported murine colonic fibroblast markers segregated across mesenchymal subsets identified by scRNA-seq (Figure 3G). The mesothelial marker Wt1 showed expression within a small, localized subpopulation of S3 cells (Wilm et al., 2005Wilm B. Ipenberg A. Hastie N.D. Burch J.B.E. Bader D.M. The serosal mesothelium is a major source of smooth muscle cells of the gut vasculature.Development. 2005; 132: 5317-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The myofibroblast marker Aoc3 was detected predominantly in the myofibroblast and pericyte clusters (Hsia et al., 2016Hsia L.T. Ashley N. Ouaret D. Wang L.M. Wilding J. Bodmer W.F. Myofibroblasts are distinguished from activated skin fibroblasts by the expression of AOC3 and other associated markers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E2162-E2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ptgs2 and Cd44 were detected it at the interface between S1.3 and S2 groups. Pdgfrα expression was maximal in S2 though present in all subsets. α-SMA (Acta2) was maximally expressed in smooth muscle with progressive reductions in expression in the myofibroblast, pericyte, and S2 groups. This is consistent with our experimental observation of distinct populations of PDGFRα+ and α-SMA+ cells, likely S2 and myofibroblasts, in the pericryptal sheath (Kurahashi et al., 2013Kurahashi M. Nakano Y. Peri L.E. Townsend J.B. Ward S.M. Sanders K.M. A novel population of subepithelial platelet-derived growth factor receptor α-positive cells in the mouse and human colon.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2013; 304: G823-G834Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Foxl1 expression, which identifies mesenchymal cells contributing to the epithelial stem cell niche, was localized to myofibroblasts and S2 (Aoki et al., 2016Aoki R. Shoshkes-Carmel M. Gao N. Shin S. May C.L. Golson M.L. Zahm A.M. Ray M. Wiser C.L. Wright C.V. Kaestner K.H. Foxl1-expressing mesenchymal cells constitute the intestinal stem cell niche.Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 2: 175-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Lymphatic endothelial cells showed maximal expression of Thy1 (Cd90), with the S1.2 group showing intermediate expression of this marker (Pinchuk et al., 2008Pinchuk I.V. Saada J.I. Beswick E.J. Boya G. Qiu S.M. Mifflin R.C. Raju G.S. Reyes V.E. Powell D.W. PD-1 ligand expression by human colonic myofibroblasts/fibroblasts regulates CD4+ T-cell activity.Gastroenterology. 2008; 135: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We also examined expression of genes utilized for existing stromal Cre recombinase models—Myh11 targeted smooth muscle and myofibroblasts, Cspg4 (Ng2) pericytes, and Fap S3. By ranking the scRNA-seq-derived subset marker genes by specificity, we could propose novel candidates for construction of selective models targeting individual stromal subsets (Figure 3H). The complete transcriptome data from healthy stromal cells allowed us to interrogate the relationships between these cells. We conducted diffusion pseudo-time analysis to order mesenchymal cells in pseudo-time to infer their developmental trajectories. Non-fibroblast cell types were first removed from the control dataset as these were considered unlikely to form part of the same developmental hierarchy. We also removed the myofibroblast cluster, as this clustered separately from the remaining fibroblasts in the diffusion map space, and intermediate forms were not observed at this sampling density. The remaining clusters (S1.1, S1.2, S1.3, S2, and S3) produced the branched structure shown in Figure 4A. While any of the three vertices (populated by S1.1, S2, and S3 cells) could represent the origin, S3 was considered the most likely candidate given its expansion and proliferative activity on DSS challenge. So, we calculated diffusion pseudo-time from this point. This placed S2 and S1.1 as fully differentiated states. S1.2 appeared an intermediate state between the crypt niche and parenchymal fibroblast with S1.3 lying between this intermediate state and the crypt niche. Using this model, we could identify genes, such as Ebf1, Thy1, and Adamdec1, predicted to show sequential induction (Figure 4B). We next examined the nature of mesenchymal remodeling following DSS challenge. 3,354 mesenchymal cells were sequenced from DSS-challenged mice, and a random forest classifier was then trained using the healthy dataset. We cross-tabulated the results of clustering and random forest classification to determine the identities of the DSS clusters (Figure 4C). Endothelial, lymphatic, pericyte, myofibroblast, S1.1, and S2 clusters were clearly identified (Tables S7 and S8). Cells comprising DSS cluster 11 were mostly classified as S1.2, albeit with a minority classified as S1.1. DSS clusters 4–7 were all classified as S3 (Figure 4D), suggesting that heterogeneity within the S3 group increased in the presence of DSS-driven inflammation. We examined whether DSS challenge led to the emergence of a population equivalent to the activated S4 population observed in human IBD using cross-tabulation. There was significant overlap between the murine orthologs of S4 markers and murine colonic stroma DSS cluster 7 (Figure S4C). Figure 4D shows a phylogenetic tree and identities of murine stromal cell clusters in DSS colitis. We assigned S3 sub-clusters decimal suffixes with the exception of cluster 7, which we labeled as S4 on the basis of its overlap with the corresponding human subset (Figure S4C). Among the shared marker genes identified were the FRC-associated chemokine Ccl19 and the IL-1 family alarmin Il33 (Figure 4E). Using the random forest classifier, we quantified changes in stromal subtype composition associated with DSS challenge. We found a significant increase in the relative abundance of S3 cells from 34% to 47% of the dataset (Figure 4F). This could arise from differential rates of proliferation or cell loss among other stromal subtypes. To investigate the former, we utilized a cell-cycle classifier to annotate the predicted cell-cycle stage of each cell in the dataset. We determined cell-cycle scores for G1 and G2/M phases for each cell using a panel of gene pairs known to exhibit cell-cycle-stage-specific expression in murine cell lines (Scialdone et al., 2015Scialdone A. Natarajan K.N. Saraiva L.R. Proserpio V. Teichmann S.A. Stegle O. Marioni J.C. Buettner F. Computational assignment of cell-cycle stage from single-cell transcriptome data.Methods. 2015; 85: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The majority of colonic fibroblast-like cells in both treatment groups were in the G0/G1 phase, as expected. However, there was an increase in G2/M annotated cells on DSS challenge. Pericytes and vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells showed the highest proliferative activity. Among fibroblast-like clusters, the highest G2M proportions were observed in the S3 and S4 subsets, indicating proliferation accounts at least partially for their increased abundance following DSS challenge (Figure 4G). We next determined the identity of the S4 population that expands in both DSS colitis and human IBD. Using published gene expression data to compare the murine colonic mesenchymal subsets we identified with murine blood or lymphatic endothelial cells, pericytes, skin and thymus fibroblasts, and FRCs. This analysis revealed the closest homology between colonic S4 cells with FRCs (Figure 4H). Since we identified corresponding clusters of fibroblast-like cells in the healthy and DSS datasets, we performed differential expression analysis between the identified subsets. The transcriptional responses to DSS challenge were dissimilar between mesenchymal subsets (Figure 4I). The DSS-induced mouse model of colitis is widely used to study mechanisms of IBD due to its simplicity and reproducibility, despite some key differences to the human disease. It is imperative to understand these differences both at the phenotypic and molecular level. Here, we used random forest models to compare the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse cells (Figure 5). Initially, we selected cells from major healthy human stromal clusters (S1–S4) to train a four-class model and found it distinguished equivalent cell types in the human UC dataset with high sensitivity and specificity. (Figure 5A). The performance of the classifier on mouse data was notably worse for the S1 subset, as the model often misclassified mouse S1 cells as S3. This result may arise from similarities in S1 and S3 populations in the human samples. Remarkably, the majority of S2 and S3 mouse clusters were classified correctly, which suggests a degree of cross-species conservation in these cell populations. Next, we replicated this result training a reverse model with mouse expression data to classify the human data. Again, this model accurately identified most S2 cells, but it often classified the human S3 cluster as S1 (Figure 5A). To investigate how gene expression drove the outcome of the model predictions, we examined how cluster specificity of the most informative genes selected by our human random forest model compared between human and mouse cell clusters. In agreement with the classification results, we found that gene specificity was most highly correlated between mouse and human S2 clusters, while S1 clusters showed little correlation, indicating less conserved gene expression patterns of this population (Figure 5B). For instance, healthy mouse S1 cells almost exclusively express Igfbp3, whereas human S1 cells do not and instead show greatest IGFBP3 expression in S2 and S3 cell populations (Figure 5C). Mfap4 is a negative marker for mouse S2 cluster but shows ubiquitous expression across all human stromal clusters (Figure 5C). Nonetheless, some key marker genes showed good levels of conservation between mouse and human data, such as the key S2 transcription factor SOX6 (Figure 5C). When we analyzed the degree of overlap between human"

Enterocytes perform the diverse tasks of absorbing a wide range of nutrients while protecting the body from the harsh bacterium-rich environment. It is unknown whether these tasks are spatially zonated along the villus axis. Here, we extracted a large panel of landmark genes characterized by transcriptomics of laser capture microdissected villus segments and utilized it for single-cell spatial reconstruction, uncovering broad zonation of enterocyte function along the villus. We found that enterocytes at villus bottoms express an anti-bacterial gene program in a microbiome-dependent manner. They next shift to sequential expression of carbohydrates, peptides, and fat absorption machineries in distinct villus compartments. Finally, they induce a Cd73 immune-modulatory program at the villus tips. Our approach can be used to uncover zonation patterns in other organs when prior knowledge of landmark genes is lacking."

The viral DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is necessary for detection of HIV by human dendritic cells and macrophages. However, synthesis of HIV DNA during infection is not sufficient for immune activation. The capsid protein, which associates with viral DNA, has a pivotal role in enabling cGAS-mediated immune activation. We now find that NONO is an essential sensor of the HIV capsid in the nucleus. NONO protein directly binds capsid with higher affinity for weakly pathogenic HIV-2 than highly pathogenic HIV-1. Upon infection, NONO is essential for cGAS activation by HIV and cGAS association with HIV DNA in the nucleus. NONO recognizes a conserved region in HIV capsid with limited tolerance for escape mutations. Detection of nuclear viral capsid by NONO to promote DNA sensing by cGAS reveals an innate strategy to achieve distinction of viruses from self in the nucleus."

Our results suggest that AMPylation may be a more widespread post-translational modification than previously appreciated and that pseudokinases should be analyzed for alternative transferase activities. Protein kinases are an important class of enzymes that transfer phosphate from ATP to protein substrates, a process known as phosphorylation (Fischer, 2013Fischer E.H. Cellular regulation by protein phosphorylation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 430: 865-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Virtually every cellular activity is regulated by protein kinases, and abnormal phosphorylation has been linked to numerous diseases. More than 500 human protein kinases have been identified and assembled into an evolutionary tree known as the human kinome (Manning et al., 2002Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). However, research is largely biased toward kinases with well-established roles in disease; it has been estimated that the molecular functions of more than 50% of human kinases remain uncharacterized (Fedorov et al., 2010Fedorov O. Müller S. Knapp S. The (un)targeted cancer kinome.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several new kinase families have been identified that are so different they were not included on the human kinome tree. These include the Fam20 and Fam69 families of secretory pathway kinases (Dudkiewicz et al., 2013Dudkiewicz M. Lenart A. Pawłowski K. A novel predicted calcium-regulated kinase family implicated in neurological disorders.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e66427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Tagliabracci et al., 2012Tagliabracci V.S.

Secreted kinase phosphorylates extracellular proteins that regulate biomineralization.Science. 2012; 336: 1150-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and the selenocysteine (Sec)-containing protein selenoprotein-O (SelO) (Dudkiewicz et al., 2012Dudkiewicz M. Szczepińska T. Grynberg M. Pawłowski K. A novel protein kinase-like domain in a selenoprotein, widespread in the tree of life.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). About 10% of human protein kinases are predicted to be inactive and referred to as pseudokinases because they are missing residues located in highly conserved sequence motifs believed to be required for ATP binding and catalysis (Manning et al., 2002Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). Pseudokinases serve a multitude of non-catalytic roles, such as allosteric regulators or scaffolding functions (Eyers and Murphy, 2013Eyers P.A. Murphy J.M.

Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, the Fam20A pseudokinase binds to and increases the stability and activity of the secretory pathway kinase Fam20C, thus acting as an allosteric regulator (Cui et al., 2015Cui J. Xiao J. Tagliabracci V.S. Wen J. Rahdar M. Dixon J.E. A secretory kinase complex regulates extracellular protein phosphorylation.eLife. 2015; 4: e06120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, the HER3 pseudokinase, although reported to have low catalytic activity, serves mostly as an allosteric activator for other members of the EGFR family of receptor kinases (Jura et al., 2009Jura N. Shan Y. Cao X. Shaw D.E. Kuriyan J. Structural analysis of the catalytically inactive kinase domain of the human EGF receptor 3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These studies have highlighted the importance of pseudokinases in human biology, and their diverse signaling functions make them attractive drug targets (Bailey et al., 2015Bailey F.P. Byrne D.P.

Foulkes D.M. Eyers P.A. Pseudokinases: update on their functions and evaluation as new drug targets.Future Med. Chem. 2017; 9: 245-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Pseudokinases were initially predicted to be inactive if they were missing one or more of the three critical residues known to participate in phosphotransfer in active kinases (Manning et al., 2002Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). These include (1) the VAIK motif in the β3-strand, where the Lys positions the α and β phosphates of ATP for catalysis (K72 using protein kinase A; PKA nomenclature); (2) the HRD motif located in the catalytic loop, where the Asp acts as the catalytic base (PKA; D166); and (3) the DFG motif; where the Asp binds the divalent cation to coordinate the β and γ phosphates of ATP (PKA; D184). However, some predicted pseudokinases have evolved compensatory mechanisms to catalyze phosphorylation by migration of active site residues including the WNK family of kinases (Min et al., 2004Min X. Lee B.H. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Crystal structure of the kinase domain of WNK1, a kinase that causes a hereditary form of hypertension.Structure. 2004; 12: 1303-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the protein O-mannosyl kinase, SGK196 (Zhu et al., 2016Zhu Q. Venzke D. Walimbe A.S. Anderson M.E. Fu Q. Kinch L.N. Wang W. Chen X. Grishin N.V. Huang N. et al.Structure of protein O-mannose kinase reveals a unique active site architecture.eLife. 2016; 5: e22238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Such compensatory mutations are often difficult to identify by primary amino acid sequence alone and have resulted in the wrongful annotation of some kinases as inactive. We previously predicted SelO to adopt a protein kinase fold (Dudkiewicz et al., 2012Dudkiewicz M. Szczepińska T. Grynberg M. Pawłowski K. A novel protein kinase-like domain in a selenoprotein, widespread in the tree of life.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, its sequence suggests that SelO would be an inactive pseudokinase because it lacks the catalytic Asp (PKA; D166) (Figures 1A and S1). Human SelO localizes to the mitochondria and incorporates the 21st genetically encoded amino acid Sec (Han et al., 2014Han S.J. Lee B.C. Yim S.H. Gladyshev V.N. Lee S.R. Characterization of mammalian selenoprotein o: a redox-active mitochondrial protein.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e95518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Kryukov et al., 2003Kryukov G.V. Castellano S.

Structurally, Sec is similar to Cys but contains a selenium atom in place of sulfur (Stadtman, 1974Stadtman T.C. Selenium biochemistry.Science. 1974; 183: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The resulting selenol group has a lower pKa than the sulfur-containing thiol group and is deprotonated at physiological pH, resulting in higher nucleophilicity and oxidoreductase efficiency (Labunskyy et al., 2014Labunskyy V.M. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Selenoproteins: molecular pathways and physiological roles.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 739-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). 25 selenoproteins are encoded in the human genome, and many are involved in cellular redox homeostasis (Kryukov et al., 2003Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes.Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, most SelO homologs contain a single Sec near the carboxy terminus (Han et al., 2014Han S.J. Lee B.C. Yim S.H. Gladyshev V.N. Lee S.R. Characterization of mammalian selenoprotein o: a redox-active mitochondrial protein.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e95518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Kryukov et al., 2003Kryukov G.V. Castellano S.

In lower eukaryotes and all prokaryotes containing a SelO homolog, an invariant Cys occupies the equivalent position (Figure 1B). For simplicity, we will use the SelO name for the entire family regardless of whether or not the protein contains a Sec.Figure S1SelO Family Sequence Logo, Related to Figure 1Show full captionThe sequence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str.

DC3000 SelO was subjected to 7 iterations of Jackhmmer search against Reference Proteomes in order to build a collection of homologs. The search yielded 3427 aligned protein sequences. The alignment was filtered so position numbers match P. syringae SelO residues and used as an input to the WebLogo server to generate the figure, which highlights conserved residues in the SelO family of pseudokinases. The height of the amino acid stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position. The position of the missing catalytic Asp (PKA; D166) is shaded and highlighted with an asterisk. SelO is highly conserved, having homologs widespread among most eukaryotic taxa, and is also common in many major bacterial taxa (Dudkiewicz et al., 2012Dudkiewicz M. Szczepińska T. Grynberg M. Pawłowski K. A novel protein kinase-like domain in a selenoprotein, widespread in the tree of life.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite this sequence-based indicator of a universal role across kingdoms, the molecular function of SelO is unknown. In fact, when prioritizing targets for experimental study, Koonin and colleagues listed SelO among the top ten most-attractive “unknown unknowns’’ because of phyletic spread and potential to reveal new and exciting biology (Galperin and Koonin, 2004Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. ‘Conserved hypothetical’ proteins: prioritization of targets for experimental study.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5452-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Here, we report the crystal structure of a SelO homolog, which reveals a protein kinase-like fold. Remarkably, the ATP in the active site is flipped relative to the orientation of ATP in the active site of canonical kinases. Our structural studies led us to discover that the SelO pseudokinases are in fact active enzymes, yet transfer AMP, instead of a phosphate group, to Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues on protein substrates (AMPylation, aka adenylylation). Furthermore, we uncover that SelO plays an evolutionarily conserved role in the cellular response to oxidative stress by AMPylating proteins involved in redox homeostasis. We anticipate that the results of this work will have important implications for redox biology and may have the potential to define new paradigms of cellular regulation and signal transduction. To demonstrate the unique conservation of SelO, we performed basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analyses against the Representative Proteomes RP55 database limited to bacteria using known human kinase domains and selenoproteins as queries in the search. We represent conservations of these different kinase and selenoprotein families as a plot of E value versus sequence identity of the top bacterial protein returned from the search (Figure 1C). Our results indicate that SelO is one of the most highly conserved members of either the human protein kinase families or the various selenoprotein families. Among bacteria, SelO is ubiquitous in Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, while in other phyla it is less frequent. In eukaryotes, most phyla contain on average 1 SelO gene per genome, while chordates and arthropods are exceptions, having an average of 2 or 0.14 genes per genome, respectively. To gain insight into the function of the SelO pseudokinases, we solved the crystal structure of the SelO homolog from the gram-negative plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae bound to an ATP derivative AMP-PNP (Figures 2A and S2A; Table S1). Despite the unique sequence found in the SelO family, P. syringae SelO adopts a protein kinase-like fold consisting of 12 β strands and 22 α helices, with the kinase domain identifying a number of kinase structures as top hits using DALI or VAST structural homology search engines (i.e., aerobactin synthase IucA, the plant receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1, the human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4, and tyrosine kinase Syk). The kinase core (β4–α14) consists of a β strand-rich N lobe and an α-helical-rich C lobe connected by a flexible linker that can be superimposed onto protein kinase CK1 with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.5 Å over 164 Cα atoms (Figure S2B). The SelO N lobe includes the regulatory αC helix (Figure 2A, orange) packing against the core β sheet (Figure 2A, magenta), while the C lobe includes a pseudo-catalytic loop lacking HRD, followed by an apparent activation loop. An N-terminal extension (α1–α5, white) stabilizes the N lobe β sheet, and the unique C-terminal domains, CTD1 (α15–α19) and CTD2 (α20–α22), contact the C lobe and the αC helix, respectively. There is no clear electron density for the last 12 residues, including the C-terminal Cys, suggesting that this region is disordered.Figure S2Crystal Structure of P. syringae SelO Reveals an Atypical Protein Kinase Fold with a Unique Orientation of the Nucleotide in the Active Site, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Amino acid sequence of P. syringae SelO depicting the secondary structural elements, color-coded as in Figure 2A.(B) Ribbon representation of protein kinase CK1 and P. syringae SelO.

Stereo view (crosseye) of SelO pseudokinase (green) bound to AMP-PNP (green ball and stick) superimposed with CK1 (cyan) bound to ATP (cyan ball and stick) reveals flipped nucleotide. The SelO nucleotide sits in a cleft between the two lobes of the kinase domain. Remarkably, the AMP-PNP molecule is flipped in the active site when compared to canonical protein kinases. The γ-phosphate, which is normally transferred to protein in a kinase reaction, is buried in a pocket between the two lobes of the kinase domain (Figure 2B). In fact, after superposition of the kinase domains, the SelO α-, β-, and γ-phosphates occupy the positions of the typical γ-, β-, and α-phosphates of protein kinases, respectively (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2C). The binding site for the flipped nucleotide adenine base and sugar ribose is formed by unique insertions in two SelO loops: the β6–β7 (Gly-rich loop) and the β8-αC loop (colored white, Figures 2B and 2D). The flipped orientation of ATP in the active site led us to hypothesize that the SelO proteins could transfer adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to protein substrates (AMPylation) (Casey and Orth, 2018Casey A.K. Orth K. Enzymes Involved in AMPylation and deAMPylation.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We incubated recombinant E. coli (ydiU), S. cerevisiae (Fmp40), and H. sapiens SelO with [γ32P]ATP or [α32P]ATP of similar specific radioactivity and observed 32P-incorporation into the wild-type (WT) proteins only when [α32P]ATP was used as substrate (Figures 3A–3C). Mutation of the active site metal-binding DFG motif in the SelO proteins abolished 32P incorporation. E. coli and human SelO, but not the inactive mutants, were immunoreactive to an anti-Thr AMP antibody (Figures S3A and S3B) (Hao et al., 2011Hao Y.H. Chuang T. Ball H.L. Luong P. Li Y. Flores-Saaib R.D. Orth K. Characterization of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against threonine-AMPylation.J. Biotechnol. 2011; 151: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Likewise, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed peptides from WT SelO proteins but not the inactive mutants, with mass shifts of 329 Da, consistent with the covalent addition of AMP to Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues (Figures 3D and S3C). Furthermore, E. coli SelO, but not the inactive mutant, could AMPylate the generic protein kinase substrate myelin basic protein (MBP) in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3E). E. coli SelO prefers ATP over other nucleotides as a co-substrate (Figure S3D) and displayed a Km for ATP of ∼2.0 μM (Figure S3E). Thus, the SelO pseudokinases can AMPylate protein substrates.Figure S3SelO Pseudokinases AMPylate Protein Substrates, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) α-Thr AMP protein immunoblotting of E. coli SelO or the inactive D256A mutant (A) or human SelO (U667C) or the inactive D348A mutant (B).

(E) Kinetic analysis depicting the concentration dependence of Mg2+/ATP on the rate of AMP incorporation into grxA (see Figure 6) by E. coli SelO. (Inset) Km for Mg2+/ATP is indicated. Reaction products were analyzed as in Figure 4B. Several interactions within the SelO active site contribute to the inverted orientation of the nucleotide, including K113 (PKA; K72) that coordinates the γ-phosphate of ATP (Figure 4A). K113 extends into the active site and is stabilized by E136 from the α6/αC helix. The formation of this ion pair, which typically positions the α-phosphate of ATP, is considered a hallmark of the activated state of a protein kinase (Taylor and Kornev, 2011Taylor S.S. Kornev A.P. Protein kinases: evolution of dynamic regulatory proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 65-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Two invariant arginines (R176 and R183) also form interactions with the γ-phosphate. R176 extends into the active site from β12 and R183 lies in the flexible hinge region that connects the N lobe to the C lobe (Figure 4A). Mutations of K113, E136, R176, or R183 to Ala inactivate E. coli SelO (Figure 4B). Most kinases require a divalent cation to orient the phosphates of ATP. In the P. syringae SelO structure, Mg2+ and Ca2+ are bound to the α- and β-phosphates of AMP-PNP and are coordinated by N253 and D262 (PKA; N171 and D184). Mutations of these residues to Ala abolished E. coli SelO activity (Figure 4B). SelO was predicted to be a pseudokinase because it lacks the catalytic Asp (PKA; D166), which deprotonates the phosphoacceptor hydroxyl on the protein substrate. However, we anticipate that D252 in P. syringae SelO could fulfill this role because of its conservation and its proximity to the α-phosphate of ATP. Furthermore, its mutation to Ala inactives E. coli SelO (Figure 4B). Collectively, the active site of P. syringae SelO reveals evolutionarily conserved interactions that provide this family of kinases with the unique ability to transfer AMP to protein substrates. The N terminus of eukaryotic SelO proteins contains a predicted mitochondrial targeting peptide (mTP). When overexpressed in mammalian cells as a GFP-fusion protein, human SelO localizes to the mitochondria (Han et al., 2014Han S.J. Lee B.C. Yim S.H. Gladyshev V.N. Lee S.R. Characterization of mammalian selenoprotein o: a redox-active mitochondrial protein.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e95518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We expressed S. cerevisiae SelO (official gene name Fmp40) in yeast as a C-terminally tagged GFP-fusion protein and observed co-localization with the mitochondrial resident protein citrate synthase (Figure S4A). Mitochondrial localization was dependent on the presence of the mTP (residues 1–23) because a truncated mutant of SelO failed to localize to the mitochondria (Figure S4A). Furthermore, we fractionated yeast extracts by sucrose-gradient centrifugation and detected endogenous SelO in fractions enriched for the mitochondrial resident protein porin (Figure S4B). Thus, S. cerevisiae SelO is a mitochondrial protein, and its localization depends on a functional mTP. Many mitochondrial proteins are subjected to redox regulation, including several selenoproteins. To test the redox function of SelO, we purified the E. coli protein under non-reducing conditions and observed a doublet when the protein was resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Figure 5A). The faster migrating species was converted to the slower migrating species upon treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Likewise, endogenous S. cerevisiae SelO migrated as two distinct species during non-reducing SDS-PAGE and was also sensitive to DTT (Figure 5B). MS analysis of E. coli SelO identified an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys272 and Cys476 (Figure 5C). To confirm the sites of modification, we incubated E. coli SelO with the cysteine alkylating agent 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS). AMS reacts with free thiols, resulting in a change in electrophoretic mobility that can be easily observed by SDS-PAGE. AMS reduced the electrophoretic mobility of WT SelO only in the presence of the reducing agent, Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). However, AMS reduced the electrophoretic mobility of the C272A and C476A mutants in the absence of TCEP (Figure 5D). Collectively, these results suggest that E. coli SelO forms an intramolecular disulfide bond between a Cys in the activation loop and the Cys at the C terminus, the latter being replaced by a Sec in higher eukaryotes (Figures 1B and 5E). The formation of disulfide bonds occurs primarily in the oxidizing environment of the secretory pathway. However, some mitochondrial proteins can also form disulfide or selenyl-sulfide bonds as part of their catalytic mechanism (Collet and Messens, 2010Collet J.F. Messens J. Structure, function, and mechanism of thioredoxin proteins.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To test whether the SelO disulfide bond regulates its activity, we incubated E. coli SelO purified under non-reducing conditions, with MBP and [α32P]ATP, and observed low levels of AMPylation (Figure 5F). However, addition of DTT or the thioredoxin system that uses reducing equivalents from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to reduce disulfides markedly increased SelO activity. Therefore, E. coli SelO activity is regulated by the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge. Based on the chemistry of the AMPylation reaction and the location of the adenine ring of ATP in the SelO crystal structure, we reasoned that using a biotinylated ATP analog would be an efficient strategy to identify proteins AMPylated by SelO. In this reaction, biotinylated AMP would be transferred to proteins, which would greatly faci"

It contributes to a foundation for evaluating circuit models of the grid cell network and is consistent with continuous attractor models as the mechanism of grid formation. Topographical maps have been observed in many sensory and motor systems. For example, neurons in primary visual cortex form a retinotopic map, in which neuronal responses are anatomically organized to reproduce the visual image on the retina (Tootell et al., 1982Tootell R.B. Silverman M.S. Switkes E. De Valois R.L. Deoxyglucose analysis of retinotopic organization in primate striate cortex.Science. 1982; 218: 902-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Similarly, sound frequency, body surface, and body musculature are represented by topographically arranged neurons in the auditory cortex (tonotopic map) (Weisz et al., 2004Weisz N. Wienbruch C. Hoffmeister S. Elbert T. Tonotopic organization of the human auditory cortex probed with frequency-modulated tones.Hear. Res. 2004; 191: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), somatosensory cortex (somatotopic map) (Kaas et al., 1979Kaas J.H. Nelson R.J. Sur M. Lin C.S. Merzenich M.M. Multiple representations of the body within the primary somatosensory cortex of primates.Science. 1979; 204: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and motor cortex (Purves et al., 2001Purves D. Augustine G.J. Fitzpatrick D. Katz L.C. LaMantia A. McNamara J.O. Williams S.M. Neuroscience.Second Edition. Sinauer Associates, 2001Google Scholar), respectively. However, topographic maps for cognitive variables have not been widely reported. A notable exception is a recently revealed topographical organization in the central complex of the fly, where a bump of activity is generated within a circle of dendritic arbors and tracks the fly’s orientation (Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015Seelig J.D. Jayaraman V. Neural dynamics for landmark orientation and angular path integration.Nature. 2015; 521: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), a cognitive variable important for navigation. In contrast, the limited number of studies on the micro-organization of neurons encoding cognitive variables in mammals, such as a rodent’s location and behavioral choice, suggest cells are spatially intermingled (Dombeck et al., 2010Dombeck D.A. Harvey C.D. Tian L. Looger L.L. Tank D.W. Functional imaging of hippocampal place cells at cellular resolution during virtual navigation.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1433-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, Harvey et al., 2012Harvey C.D. Coen P. Tank D.W. Choice-specific sequences in parietal cortex during a virtual-navigation decision task.Nature. 2012; 484: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The fact that topographical maps exist in some neural networks but not others indicates that topography is not required for the function of neural networks, as some networks can operate by enforcing a certain connectivity diagram on randomly arranged neurons. However, in the presence of topography, the anatomical arrangement of neurons mirrors the pattern of projections they receive (e.g., somatotopic map) or the property of the variable computed in the network (e.g., tonotopic map), favoring both the precision and efficiency of neural connectivity and facilitating circuit function. Here, we address the relationship between anatomical location and function of grid cells in the mouse medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a higher cognitive system important for spatial representation and episodic memory. In rodents, the firing fields of each grid cell lie on a triangular lattice characterized by spatial scale, lattice orientation, and phase (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Given the previous findings of nearly non-existent topography for cognitive variables, do MEC grid cells with these different properties also exhibit limited topography? Grid cells are highly abundant in layer 2 of the MEC, which contains two excitatory cell types: pyramidal cells, which are arranged in patches on a triangular lattice, and stellate cells, which distribute between patches (Kitamura et al., 2014Kitamura T. Pignatelli M. Suh J. Kohara K. Yoshiki A. Abe K. Tonegawa S. Island cells control temporal association memory.Science. 2014; 343: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, Ray et al., 2014Ray S. Naumann R. Burgalossi A. Tang Q. Schmidt H. Brecht M. Grid-layout and theta-modulation of layer 2 pyramidal neurons in medial entorhinal cortex.Science. 2014; 343: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Grid cells also form functionally independent modules, in which scale and orientation are similar for cells within a module, but different across modules (Stensola et al., 2012Stensola H. Stensola T. Solstad T. Frøland K. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. The entorhinal grid map is discretized.Nature. 2012; 492: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because previous tetrode recordings cannot identify the precise anatomical location of recorded cells, it remains undetermined how grid cells are arranged within the pyramidal/stellate structure and how different modules are organized at the microstructural level. Moreover, within each module, it is unclear how cells with different grid phases (the relative locations of grid vertices, Figures 1A and 1B ) are organized. In one class of continuous attractor networks (CAN) that model grid firing, neuronal activity across the population is manifest as multiple bumps of activity in a two-dimensional (2D) sheet of phase-arranged grid cells (Burak and Fiete, 2009Burak Y. Fiete I.R. Accurate path integration in continuous attractor network models of grid cells.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000291Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, Fuhs and Touretzky, 2006Fuhs M.C. Touretzky D.S. A spin glass model of path integration in rat medial entorhinal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4266-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). If the brain uses the efficiently implemented synaptic connectivity underlying attractor models, in which each neuron has spatially restricted interactions with its surrounding neighbors, one predicts that grid cells with identical phase might be anatomically located in a set of vertices of a grid like lattice pattern across the cell sheet. Also, in the local neighborhood of any particular grid cell the relative anatomical arrangement of cells with different phases would correspond to their relative 2D phase offsets (Figure 1C, i). During early development, such a topographically arranged network could also serve as a teaching signal for a less topographical grid cell network in adults (McNaughton et al., 2006McNaughton B.L.

Although evidence exists supporting CAN models (Couey et al., 2013Couey J.J. Witoelar A. Zhang S.J. Zheng K. Ye J. Dunn B. Czajkowski R. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Roudi Y. Witter M.P.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the topographical pattern of phases that would be predicted if neuron somas were organized anatomically according to their connectivity has never been examined, although higher activity correlations between nearby grid cells suggests closer phases (Heys et al., 2014Heys J.G.

The functional micro-organization of grid cells revealed by cellular-resolution imaging.Neuron. 2014; 84: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cells may be connected according to their phases but soma locations may be topographically random (Figure 1C, ii). Such topographical randomness increases the difficulty of establishing the precise synaptic connectivity matrix required for CAN models. In general, a better understanding of the micro-organization of grid phases will help to elucidate the potential biological implementation of CAN models. Here, we investigated the micro-organization of grid cells in mouse MEC using cellular resolution two-photon calcium imaging during navigation, which allowed us to precisely correlate grid cell activity with anatomical location. We demonstrate a significant map-like relationship between the topography of these neurons and their circuit function. Two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in layer 2 of the mouse MEC was performed using a microprism chronically implanted into the transverse fissure, providing fields of view (FOVs) nearly parallel to the cortical surface (Low et al., 2014Low R.J. Gu Y. Tank D.W. Cellular resolution optical access to brain regions in fissures: imaging medial prefrontal cortex and grid cells in entorhinal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 18739-18744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A and S1B). Imaging was performed in GP5.3 transgenic mice (Dana et al., 2014Dana H. Chen T.W. Hu A. Shields B.C. Guo C. Looger L.L. Kim D.S. Svoboda K. Thy1-GCaMP6 transgenic mice for neuronal population imaging in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e108697Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), which expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in both pyramidal and stellate cells (77.6% ± 5.0% and 91.0% ± 1.2%, respectively) (Figures S1C–S1G), allowing simultaneous and minimally biased measurement of activity of the two cell populations (Figure S1H). The two cell types could be distinguished in vivo based on cell body diameters: stellate cells generally have larger diameters than pyramidal cells. The two cell types were classified with high accuracy (98.0% and 96.4% for stellate and pyramidal cells, respectively), and classified pyramidal cells formed multiple patches surrounded by stellate cells, as previous observed (Kitamura et al., 2014Kitamura T.

Calcium imaging was performed while mice ran unidirectionally along 1D virtual tracks (10 or 18 min, Figures S1O and S1P). As shown previously, cells exhibited multiple “spatial fields,” which were used to identify putative grid cells by applying a previously developed 1D grid cell classifier (Domnisoru et al., 2013Domnisoru C.

We augmented the classifier to eliminate a recently discovered non-grid spatial cell type in the MEC (7.3% ± 1.3% of cells originally classified as grid cells), which represents environmental features (Diehl et al., 2017Diehl G.W.

We first investigated how grid cells map onto anatomical cell types: pyramidal and stellate cells. While a consensus has not been reached on the relative proportions of grid cells in the two cell populations (Domnisoru et al., 2013Domnisoru C. Kinkhabwala A.A. Tank D.W.

Among stellate cells, a larger fraction was identified as grid cells (40.1% ± 4.5%) than among pyramidal cells (18.4% ± 2.9%) (Figures 2B and 2C), and most grid cells were stellate (75.6% ± 3.2%). Relatedly, significant calcium transients in stellate cells generally showed higher frequencies and larger amplitudes than in pyramidal cells (Figure S2D). Grid cells had similar transient frequencies and amplitudes, independent of their stellate or pyramidal identity (Figure S2E).Figure S2Properties of Pyramidal and Stellate Cells in Virtual Navigation; Assigning Grid Modules Based on Their 1D Responses, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) Percentages of imaged cue cells that were classified as stellate (SteC) and pyramidal cells (PyrC). p = 4.6 × 10−3.(B) Pairwise distances between cue cells versus those between cue and grid cells.(C) An example of the distribution of cue and grid cells among stellate and pyramidal cells.

Anatomically, grid cells mainly clustered and were largely separated from non-grid cells, as revealed by shorter pairwise distances between grid cells than between grid and non-grid cells (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the percentage of grid cells increased from center to edge of pyramidal patches (Figure 2E), and pyramidal grid cells were closer to stellate cells than pyramidal non-grid cells (Figure 2F). These results indicate that pyramidal cells located at the edge of patches, and thus closer to stellate cells, are more likely to be grid cells than those near patch centers. Consistently, frequencies and amplitudes of significant transients increased from the center to the edge of pyramidal patches (Figures S2F and S2G). The relatively low percentage of grid cells among pyramidal cells and the edge-distribution of grid cells within pyramidal patches were also consistently observed in another transgenic mouse line (Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93), in which 95.3% of pyramidal cells in layer 2 of the MEC were specifically labeled by GCaMP6f (Figures S2H–S2N). This observation provides evidence that the different features of grid cells in pyramidal and stellate cells, especially grid cell percentages, were not biased by the lower percentage of GCaMP6f labeling of pyramidal cells than stellate cells in the GP 5.3 mice. In summary, grid cells in layer 2 form clusters that are comprised of mostly stellate cells and some pyramidal cells at patch edges (Figure 2G). Although modules with larger scale generally distribute more ventrally than those with smaller scales, most modules are reported to show some degree of overlap (Stensola et al., 2012Stensola H. Stensola T. Solstad T. Frøland K. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. The entorhinal grid map is discretized.Nature. 2012; 492: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Cellular-resolution imaging allowed us to investigate the microstructural organization of modules in the overlapping areas. Grid modules, which are typically defined by clustering of spatial response scales of neurons in 2D environments (Stensola et al., 2012Stensola H. Stensola T. Solstad T. Frøland K. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. The entorhinal grid map is discretized.Nature. 2012; 492: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), were accurately determined (100% and 98% in two datasets, Figures S2O–S2T) by clustering 1D field spacings and widths of the same set of grid cells on two different virtual linear tracks or two different trials on the same track (Figure 3A). The properties of assigned grid modules were further validated based on the previous theory that the 1D response of a grid cell is well approximated as a slice through a 2D triangular lattice; the 2D field width, spacing, and orientation of the cell were estimated as the width and spacing of the lattice, and the angle of the slice, respectively (Yoon et al., 2016Yoon K.

https://openalex.org/W2893075893,"Conventional manufacturing of protein biopharmaceuticals in centralized, large-scale, single-product facilities is not well-suited to the agile production of drugs for small patient populations or individuals. Previous solutions for small-scale manufacturing are limited in both process reproducibility and product quality, owing to their complicated means of protein expression and purification. We describe an automated, benchtop, multiproduct manufacturing system, called Integrated Scalable Cyto-Technology (InSCyT), for the end-to-end production of hundreds to thousands of doses of clinical-quality protein biologics in about 3 d. Unlike previous systems, InSCyT includes fully integrated modules for sustained production, efficient purification without the use of affinity tags, and formulation to a final dosage form of recombinant biopharmaceuticals. We demonstrate that InSCyT can accelerate process development from sequence to purified drug in 12 weeks. We used integrated design to produce human growth hormone, interferon α-2b and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with highly similar processes on this system and show that their purity and potency are comparable to those of marketed reference products."

Natural killer (NK) cells had the highest differential expression of RAB11FIP5, which was associated with greater dysregulation of NK cell subsets in bnAb subjects. NK cells from bnAb individuals had a more adaptive/dysfunctional phenotype and exhibited impaired degranulation and cytokine production that correlated with RAB11FIP5 transcript levels.

A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is to design an immunization strategy that can induce broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) (Haynes and Burton, 2017Haynes B.F. Burton D.R.

This phenotype is similar to the immunologic profile of patients with autoimmune disease and provides support for the hypothesis that HIV-1-infected individuals who make bnAbs have less robust immune control of antibody responses. Thus, precisely defining the cellular and molecular events that lead to the generation of bnAbs during HIV-1 infection is critical for learning how to induce HIV-1 bnAbs. Antibody responses are controlled not only by CD4+ Treg and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells, but also by other subsets of immunoregulatory cells (Borrow and Moody, 2017Borrow P. Moody M.A. Immunologic characteristics of HIV-infected individuals who make broadly neutralizing antibodies.Immunol. Rev. 2017; 275: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably, natural killer (NK) cells, in addition to their effector role in defense against virus infections and tumors, also have immunoregulatory effects and modulate adaptive immune responses in inflammatory/autoimmune conditions and infections (Gianchecchi et al., 2018Gianchecchi E.

Whether NK cells play a similar role in regulating antibody responses in humans remains unclear. Here, we have performed a transcriptome-wide study in a well-characterized cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals, comparing those who developed plasma bnAb activity with individuals with no plasma bnAb activity (Moody et al., 2016Moody M.A. Pedroza-Pacheco I. Vandergrift N.A. Chui C. Lloyd K.E. Parks R. Soderberg K.A. Ogbe A.T. Cohen M.S. Liao H.X. et al.Immune perturbations in HIV-1-infected individuals who make broadly neutralizing antibodies.Sci. Immunol. 2016; 1: aag0851Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After controlling for confounding variables, we found Rab11 family-interacting protein 5 (RAB11FIP5) transcripts were significantly elevated in subjects who made bnAbs compared to those who did not. The highest differential RAB11FIP5 expression was in NK cells. RAB11FIP5 encodes an effector protein in recycling endosomes (Hales et al., 2001Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Identification and characterization of a family of Rab11-interacting proteins.J. Biol.

These data suggest that NK cell dysregulation and the emergence of an NK cell subset with altered functionality are permissive for bnAb development and implicate Rab11 recycling endosomes as modulators of the HIV-1 neutralizing antibody response. Antibody neutralization breadth was measured in a previously characterized cohort of 239 chronically HIV-infected individuals, from whom a subset of individuals with the highest HIV-1 neutralization breadth were selected as the bnAb group and individuals with low or no neutralization breadth were selected as the control group without bnAbs. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 47 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals who developed bnAbs (bnAb group, cohort A) and 46 HIV-1-infected individuals who did not have bnAbs (control group, cohort A) (Moody et al., 2016Moody M.A. Pedroza-Pacheco I. Vandergrift N.A. Chui C. Lloyd K.E. Parks R. Soderberg K.A. Ogbe A.T. Cohen M.S. Liao H.X. et al.Immune perturbations in HIV-1-infected individuals who make broadly neutralizing antibodies.Sci. Immunol. 2016; 1: aag0851Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 93 HIV-1 infected individuals analyzed consisted of 62 females and 31 males, whose ages ranged from 19–64 years and 84 (88%) were African (Figure S1A). Transcriptome analysis identified 322 transcripts that were differentially expressed in individuals who developed bnAbs, 222 of which differed by more than 2-fold (Figure 1A; Table S1). Interestingly, 5 of the top 10 most significantly changed genes were involved with endosomal intracellular trafficking pathways (RAB11FIP5, SYT11, RAP2A, ALS2CL, and RABGAP1L; Figure 1A). After controlling for age, sex, country, autoantibody status, and viral load, the only gene that remained significantly differentially expressed in the bnAb group was RAB11FIP5 (Figures 1B and 1C). For the characterization of HIV-1 antibody neutralization breadth in cohort A, we previously used a neutralization panel of 12 HIV-1 isolates and performed a principal component analysis of the data. Principal component 1 (PC1) scores are a proxy for neutralization breadth accounting for neutralization magnitude; a higher PC1 score indicates more neutralization breadth and a lower PC1 score means less breadth (Moody et al., 2016Moody M.A. Pedroza-Pacheco I. Vandergrift N.A. Chui C. Lloyd K.E. Parks R. Soderberg K.A. Ogbe A.T. Cohen M.S. Liao H.X. et al.Immune perturbations in HIV-1-infected individuals who make broadly neutralizing antibodies.Sci. Immunol. 2016; 1: aag0851Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression levels of RAB11FIP5 correlated with neutralization breadth (r = 0.50, p ≤ 0.05; Spearman, Figure 1D) but not with viral load (r = 0.09, NS; Spearman, Figure 1E). qPCR of PBMCs from bnAb individuals analyzed by RNA-seq (cohort A) combined with a second smaller cohort of HIV-1 infected individuals from the United States composed of individuals who produced bnAbs and those who had lower levels of plasma neutralizing antibodies (cohort B, n = 21) (Moody et al., 2016Moody M.A. Pedroza-Pacheco I. Vandergrift N.A. Chui C. Lloyd K.E. Parks R. Soderberg K.A. Ogbe A.T. Cohen M.S. Liao H.X. et al.Immune perturbations in HIV-1-infected individuals who make broadly neutralizing antibodies.Sci. Immunol. 2016; 1: aag0851Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) confirmed the higher level of RAB11FIP5 expression in PBMCs of those that made bnAbs (Figure S1B). PBMC from bnAb or control individuals with the highest and lowest PBMC RAB11FIP5 expression levels, respectively, were separated into CD19 B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and non-B/T cells (Figure S1C), and the level of expression of RAB11FIP5 in each subset was determined by qPCR. There were no significant differences in viral load in the two groups of selected individuals. The highest difference in expression of RAB11FIP5 between subjects with and without bnAbs was in CD8 and non-B/T cells (Figure 1F). Non-B/T cells were further fractionated into CD14+ monocytes, CD56+CD16+ NK cells, and plasmacytoid (p) and myeloid (m) dendritic cell (DC) populations (Figure S1D), and the highest differential expression of RAB11FIP5 was found to be in the NK cell subset (Figure 1G). RNA-seq performed on NK cells from bnAb and no-bnAb control individuals also detected the highest differential expression of RAB11FIP5 mRNA within the NK cell population (Figure S1E; p = 0.03, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney). Thus, we hypothesized that alterations in the NK cell compartment may contribute to the development of bnAbs during HIV-1 infection. Transcriptome analysis of the purified CD3−CD56+CD16+ NK cells from bnAb and control individuals by RNA-seq identified 95 transcripts (44 upregulated and 51 downregulated) that were differentially expressed in individuals from the bnAb group versus control subjects without bnAbs, one of which was RAB11FIP5 (Figure S2A; Table S2). We did not control for viral load in this analysis due to the small sample size. We found that NK cells from bnAb and control subjects expressed equivalent levels of GZMB, GZMH, GZMM, and PRF1 (perforin) killing molecules, but NK cells from bnAb subjects had lower expression of GZMA and GZMK, that mediate caspase-independent cell lysis and also lower expression of TNFSF10 (TRAIL) that mediates caspase-dependent cell lysis (Figure S2B). NK cells from bnAb individuals also expressed lower levels of PLZF, interleukin (IL)12 and IL18 receptor transcripts and CD27 while having increased CD6 expression (Figure S2C). These results indicated that CD3−CD56+CD16+ NK cells, the majority of which are mature CD56dim NK cells, had transcripts indicative of acquisition of an adaptive-like NK cell phenotype (Béziat et al., 2010Béziat V.

In humans, NK cells are classically grouped into two main subsets on the basis of expression of CD56 and CD16. The CD56brightCD16−/+ subset is primarily specialized for cytokine production whereas the CD56dimCD16+ NK cells represent a more mature subset, exhibiting high levels of perforin and enhanced killing. Chronic infection with viruses including HIV-1 is associated with a significant redistribution of the NK compartment, with the emergence of a third aberrant and anergic CD56−CD16+ NK cell subset (Alter et al., 2005Alter G.

NK cell subset distributions were determined in PBMCs from individuals in the bnAb (n = 22) and control (n = 19) groups and a demographically matched HIV seronegative (n = 22) group (Figure S3A). We selected the top 10 RAB11FIP5-expressing individuals in the bnAb group and the lowest 10 RAB11FIP5-expressing individuals in the control group, with all other individuals being selected to ensure matching between groups for age, sex, and country of origin. No differences were observed between groups in the percentage of total NK cells within live lymphocytes (Figure S3B). The proportion of CD56brightCD16+/− NK cells also did not differ significantly between any of the groups (Figures 2A and 2B ). However, in the bnAb individuals, the CD56dim subset was significantly decreased compared to HIV-1 control and HIV-1 seronegative subjects (Figures 2A and 2C). Notably, in bnAb individuals, a high proportion of NK cells had a CD56−CD16+ phenotype (mean = 31.5 ± 4.2 and ranging up to 72.9% of total NK cells), whereas CD56−CD16+ cells comprised a smaller proportion of total NK cells in control individuals (mean = 12.6 ± 2.7) and a minor subset of NK cells in HIV-1 seronegative subjects (mean = 6.2 ± 1.1) (Figures 2D and S3C).Figure 2More Pronounced NK Cell Subset Redistribution in bnAb versus Control SubjectsShow full caption(A) Representative pseudocolor flow cytometry plots from bnAb, control, and HIV-seronegative individuals showing NK cell subsets distinguished on the basis of CD56 and CD16 expression.

See also Figure S3 and Table S2. The proportion of CD56dim cytotoxic NK cells correlated negatively with RAB11FIP5 mRNA (Figure 2E) and HIV-1 antibody neutralization breadth (PC1 scores) (Figure 2F), whereas a positive correlation was observed between the CD56−CD16+ subset and RAB11FIP5 mRNA expression levels in PBMC (Figure 2E) and PC1 scores (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that NK cell subset redistribution and the emergence of an aberrant NK cell population were associated with both PBMC RAB11FIP5 expression and plasma HIV-1 neutralization breadth. Individuals with bnAbs had a lower proportion of total NK cells expressing the inhibitory receptor NKG2A (Figure 3A), but no difference in the proportion positive for the activating receptor NKG2C (Figure 3B). The proportion of total NK cells positive for inhibitory KIRs (identified using a cocktail of antibodies against KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/L3/S2, KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2) was higher in bnAb subjects compared to HIV-1 controls (Figure 3C), and the proportion of cells positive for the inhibitory receptor CD85j was higher in bnAb subjects compared to both HIV-1 control and in HIV-1 seronegative individuals (Figure 3D). Lower frequencies of NKG2A expressing NK cells coupled with increased frequencies of cells expressing inhibitory NK receptors suggested an accentuated shift toward NK cell maturation in the bnAb group. However, the proportion of cells positive for CD57, also a marker of terminal NK cell differentiation, did not differ among the 3 groups (Figure 3E). Adaptive NK cells have been shown to have decreased expression of the inhibitory receptor Siglec7, the signaling molecule FcεRIγ and the transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) (Della Chiesa et al., 2016Della Chiesa M.

The NK cells from individuals in the bnAb group had significantly lower proportions of Siglec7 and PLZF-expressing cells compared to the control and seronegative groups and a lower proportion of NK cells expressed FcεRγ compared to the control group (Figures 3F–3H). Co-expression analysis using Boolean gating revealed an enrichment of CD57+ FcεRIγ− PLZF− Siglec7− NK cells within the bnAb group, particularly in subjects with high RAB11FIP5 mRNA levels compared to HIV-1 control individuals with low RAB11FIP5 mRNA levels (Figure 3I). Subset analysis of NK cell populations revealed similar differences between groups in receptor expression on both the CD56dim and CD56−CD16+ NK cell subsets (Figures S4A and S4B). Notably the CD56−CD16+ subset, which was more predominant in the bnAb group, had the lowest frequency of cells positive for Siglec-7, FcεRIγ, and PLZF expression (Figures S4A and S4B) suggesting that this subset shares features of adaptive NK cells. Significant correlations were observed between RAB11FIP5 transcript levels in PBMC and mature/adaptive-like NK cell attributes and additional features signifying their aberrant dysregulation: a negative correlation with NKG2A (r = −0.59, p = 0.001; Spearman), positive correlations with levels of expression of CD85j (r = 0.53, p = 0.003; Spearman) and inhibitory KIRs (r = 0.58, p = 0.001; Spearman), and negative correlations with Siglec7 expression (r = −0.50, p = 0.005; Spearman), FcεRIγ (r = −0.62, p = 0.0006; Spearman), and PLZF (r = −0.60, p = 0.001; Spearman) (Figures S5A–S5F).

https://openalex.org/W2894973120,"Background and objective The involvement of the oral microbiota as a possible link between periodontitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity is still not well understood. The objective of the study was to investigate if glycemic control and obesity play a role in modulating the composition and diversity of the oral microbial ecology. Material and methods A cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 18) was recruited. Participants demonstrating improved glycemic control after 3 months (n = 6) were included in a second examination. A full mouth examination was performed to estimate periodontitis severity followed by sample collection (subgingival plaque and saliva). Generation of large sequence libraries was performed using the high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Results The majority of participants (94.4%, n = 17) presented with moderate or severe forms of periodontitis. Differences in microbial composition and diversity between obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2) groups were statistically significant. Cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches failed to reveal statistically significant associations between HbA1c level and species composition or diversity. Conclusions Obesity was significantly associated with the oral microbial composition. The impact of glycemic control on oral microbiota, however, could not be assured statistically."

https://openalex.org/W2892856010,"Although physicians learn about new medical technologies from their peers, the magnitude and source of peer influence is unknown. We estimate the effect of peer adoption of three first-in-class medications (dabigatran, sitigliptin, and aliskiren) on physicians’ own adoption of those medications. We included 11,958 physicians in Pennsylvania prescribing anticoagulant, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive medications. We constructed 4 types of peer networks based on shared Medicare and Medicaid patients, medical group affiliation, hospital affiliation, and medical school/residency training. Instrumental variables analysis was used to estimate the causal effect of peer adoption (fraction of peers in each network adopting the new drug) on physician adoption (prescribing at least the median number prescriptions within 15 months of the new drug’s introduction). We illustrate how physician network position can inform targeting of interventions to physicians by computing a social multiplier. Dabigatran was adopted by 25.2%, sitagliptin by 24.5% and aliskiren by 8.3% of physicians. A 10-percentage point increase in peer adoption in the patient-sharing network led to a 5.90% (SE = 1.50%, p<0.001) increase in physician adoption of dabigatran, 8.32% (SE = 1.51%, p<0.001) increase in sitagliptin, and 7.84% increase in aliskiren adoption (SE = 2.93%, p<0.001). Peer effects through shared hospital affiliation were positive but not significant, and medical group and training network effects were not reliably estimated. Physicians in the top decile of patient-sharing network peers were estimated to have nearly 2-fold stronger influence on their peers’ adoption compared to physicians in the top decile of prescribing volume. Limitations include lack of detailed clinical information and pharmaceutical promotion, variables which may influence physician adoption but which are unlikely to bias our peer effect estimates. Peer adoption, especially by those with whom physicians share patients, strongly influenced physician adoption of new drugs. Our study shows the potential for using information on physician peer networks to improve technology diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2894638138,"Introduction Obesity is a serious health problem worldwide, particularly in developed countries. It is a risk factor for many diseases, including thyroid cancer. The relationship between obesity and prognostic factors of thyroid cancer is unclear. Aims We sought to ascertain the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and clinicopathological features increasing the risk of poor clinical course, treatment response, and clinical outcome in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Subjects & methods The study included 1181 patients with DTC (88% women and 12% men) treated at a single center from 2000 to 2016. BMI before surgery and aggressive clinicopathological features, according to the American Thyroid Initial Risk stratification system, were analyzed. The relationship between BMI and initial risk, treatment response, and final status of the disease was evaluated, incorporating the revised 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines and the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Tumor-Node-Metastasis (AJCC/TNM) staging system. Patients were stratified according to the World Health Organization classification of BMI. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Median follow-up was 7.7 years (1–16 years). There were no significant associations between BMI and extrathyroidal extension (microscopic and gross), cervical lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis in univariate and multivariate analyses. BMI did not affect initial risk, treatment response or disease outcome. Obesity was more prevalent in men (p = 0.035) and in patients ≥55 years old (p = 0.001). There was no statistically significant relationship between BMI and more advanced TNM stage in patients ≤55 years old (stage I vs. stage II) (p = 0.266) or in patients >55 years old (stage I–II vs. III–IV) (p = 0.877). Conclusions Obesity is not associated with more aggressive clinicopathological features of thyroid cancer. Obesity is not a risk factor for progression to more advanced stages of disease, nor is it a prognostic factor for poorer treatment response and clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2894885951,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) have been increasingly recognized as relevant pathogens in hospitalized, immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. As a result of complex mechanisms, including biofilm formation and multidrug resistance phenotype, S. maltophilia and Bcc respiratory infections are often refractory to therapy, and have been associated with a worse outcome in CF patients. Here we demonstrate for the first time that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a mucolytic agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may exhibit antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against these pathogens. The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of high NAC concentrations, potentially achievable by topical administration, was tested against a collection of S. maltophilia (n = 19) and Bcc (n = 19) strains, including strains from CF patients with acquired resistance traits. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/ml and from 32 to >32 mg/ml, respectively. Sub-MIC concentrations (i.e., 0.25 × MIC) slowed down the growth kinetics of most strains. In time-kill assays, 2-day-old biofilms were more affected than planktonic cultures, suggesting a specific antibiofilm activity of NAC against these pathogens. Indeed, a dose- and time-dependent antibiofilm activity of NAC against most of the S. maltophilia and Bcc strains tested was observed, with a sizable antibiofilm activity observed also at 0.5 and 1 × MIC NAC concentrations. Furthermore, at those concentrations, NAC was also shown to significantly inhibit biofilm formation with the great majority of tested strains."

https://openalex.org/W2893222242,"The IL-1 cytokines are considered among the first family of cytokines that orchestrate acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Both IL-1β and IL-1α are members of the IL-1 family; however, their distinct roles in the inflammatory processes remain poorly understood. We explored the role of IL-1α in IL-1β-activated signaling pathways causing synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using synovial fibroblasts isolated from RA joints, we found that IL-1β significantly stimulated IL-1α expression, which was selectively inhibited by blocking the NF-κB pathway. Knockdown of IL-1α using small interfering RNA abolished IL-1β-induced pro-IL-1α and pro-IL-1β expression and suppressed inflammation. Native and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that IL-1α cooperates in NF-κBp65 binding to the distal region of IL-1α promoter and to the proximal region of IL-1β promoter upstream of the transcription start site to stabilize their gene transcription. Molecular dynamics simulation of IL-1α or IL-1β binding to IL-1 receptor showed distinct interaction sites that corroborate with the ability of IL-1α to differentially activate phosphorylation of signaling proteins compared with IL-1β. Our study highlights the importance of IL-1α in mediating IL-1β-induced inflammation in addition to maintaining its expression and providing a rationale for targeting IL-1α to minimize the role of IL-1β in inflammatory diseases like RA.-Singh, A.

https://openalex.org/W2894986179,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a frequent pathogen causing nosocomial infections and outbreaks. We developed a multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay for the detection of K. pneumoniae, which can get the positive results within 40 minutes' isothermal amplification. Gold-nanoparticle lateral flow biosensor (LFB) and colorimetric indicators were used for the rapid readouts of MCDA amplification. The detection limit of this assay was 100 fg per reaction at 65°C, which was confirmed to be the optimal amplification temperature according to the real time turbidimeters. For specificity, all of the 30 clinical-source K. pneumoniae strains were positive for the MCDA, and all of the non-K. pneumoniae strains belonging to 31 different species were negative for this MCDA assay. To evaluate the practical applicability of this method, we assessed its detection limit for K. pneumoniae strains in sputum samples (24 CFU per reaction), and DNA templates of 100 sputum samples further underwent the MCDA-LFB tests. All of the sputum samples being positive for K. pneumoniae (30/100) with the culture method were successfully identified with the MCDA assay, the detection power of which was higher than that of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (25/100). Thus, the MCDA test for K. pneumoniae combined with the gold nanoparticle LFB as the results readout scheme, are simple, specific, and sensitive methods for the rapid diagnosis of K. pneumoniae in clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W2895702882,"Recent research suggests that personality, defined as consistent individual behavioral variation, in farm animals could be an important factor when considering their health, welfare, and productivity. However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object contact duration (Rs = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (Rs = 0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between the first and second tests for activity/exploration (Rs = 0.334, P = 0.058) and for boldness (Rs = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day situations."
https://openalex.org/W2894600089,"The transcription factor NF-E2 Related Factor-2 (NRF2) is an important drug target. Activation of NRF2 has chemopreventive effects in cancer and exerts beneficial effects in a number of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory diseases, hepatosteatosis, obesity and insulin resistance. Hence, there have been great efforts to discover and characterize novel NRF2 activators. One reported NRF2 activator is the labdane diterpenoid andrographolide. In this study, we identified the mechanism through which andrographolide activates NRF2. We showed that andrographolide inhibits the function of KEAP1, a protein that together with CUL3 and RBX1 forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitinates NRF2. Andrographolide partially inhibits the interaction of KEAP1 with CUL3 in a manner dependent on Cys151 in KEAP1. This suggests that andrographolide forms Michael acceptor dependent adducts with Cys151 in KEAP1 in vivo, leading to inhibition of NRF2 ubiquitination and consequently accumulation of the transcription factor. Interestingly, we also showed that at higher concentrations andrographolide increases NRF2 protein expression in a Cys151 independent, but likely KEAP1 dependent manner, possibly through modification of other Cys residues in KEAP1. In this study we also screened secondary metabolites produced by endophytes isolated from non-flowering plants for NRF2-inducing properties. One of the extracts, ORX 41, increased both NRF2 protein expression and transcriptional activity markedly. These results suggest that endophytes isolated from non-flowering or other plants may be a good source of novel NRF2 inducing compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2895577581,"Moral evaluations occur quickly following heuristic-like intuitive processes without effortful deliberation. There are several competing explanations for this. The ADC-model predicts that moral judgment consists in concurrent evaluations of three different intuitive components: the character of a person (Agent-component, A); their actions (Deed-component, D); and the consequences brought about in the situation (Consequences-component, C). Thereby, it explains the intuitive appeal of precepts from three dominant moral theories (virtue ethics, deontology, and consequentialism), and flexible yet stable nature of moral judgment. Insistence on single-component explanations has led to many centuries of debate as to which moral precepts and theories best describe (or should guide) moral evaluation. This study consists of two large-scale experiments and provides a first empirical investigation of predictions yielded by the ADC model. We use vignettes describing different moral situations in which all components of the model are varied simultaneously. Experiment 1 (within-subject design) shows that positive descriptions of the A-, D-, and C-components of moral intuition lead to more positive moral judgments in a situation with low-stakes. Also, interaction effects between the components were discovered. Experiment 2 further investigates these results in a between-subject design. We found that the effects of the A-, D-, and C-components vary in strength in a high-stakes situation. Moreover, sex, age, education, and social status had no effects. However, preferences for precepts in certain moral theories (PPIMT) partially moderated the effects of the A- and C-component. Future research on moral intuitions should consider the simultaneous three-component constitution of moral judgment."

Nevertheless, it is one of the missing elements within the continuum of maternal and child healthcare. Despite the WHO’s recommendation, most of the developing countries have not yet started implementing preconception care. Objective To determine the knowledge level of healthcare providers about PCCand to identify predictors of effective knowledge of preconception care. Method This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 634 healthcare providers (HCP) working in public health institutions of Hawassa. A pilot-tested and validated self-administered survey tool was used to collect data from individual healthcare providers who were selected randomly using a multistage sampling technique. The data entry and analysis were conducted using SPSS version 20 software. Frequency, proportions, means and standard deviations were used to describe the data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were implemented to determine the predictors of HCP’s PCC knowledge. Results Only a few (31%) of the healthcare providers demonstrated a good level of knowledge on preconception care. The odds of having good PCC knowledge was high among HCPs working in hospitals (AOR = 1.8, 95% C.I. 1.3–2.6), HCPs using their smart phone to access clinical resources (AOR = 1.4, 95% C.I. 1.1–2.0), among those HCPs ever have read PCC guideline prepared by organization outside of Ethiopia (AOR = 1.9, 95% C.I. 1.4–2.7), among those who claimed practicing PCC (AOR = 3.4, 95% C.I. 2.0–5.9), and among those who earn salary of ≥ 146.0 $(AOR = 1.5, 95% C.I. 1.1–2.1). Conclusion There is an unacceptably low level of knowledge about PCC among most of the healthcare providers in public health facilities in Ethiopia. The predictors identified in this study can be used to enhance the knowledge of healthcare providers about preconception care."

However, it is not known whether it shares the same protective effect against diabetes as estrogen and the underlying mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of phytoestrogen resveratrol and exogenous 17β-estradiol against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes. Female mice were ovariectomized (OVX) and chronically injected with different concentrations of resveratrol (0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg) and 17β-estradiol (0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg) subcutaneously for 4 weeks, and the levels of blood glucose, plasma insulin, plasma antioxidant capacity, the changes of pancreatic islet cells and the expressions of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) were detected. Resveratrol and 17β-estradiol significantly inhibited the increase of the blood glucose level and the rise of plasma malondialdehyde in STZ-induced diabetic mice, improved the levels of plasma antioxidant capacity and plasma insulin, protected the pancreatic islet cells, and increased the expressions of GLUT4 and IRS-1, but decreased p-ERK expression in skeletal muscle and myocardial tissue. The results suggest that resveratrol or 17β-estradiol shows obvious protection against STZ-induced diabetes in OVX mice, the mechanisms probably involve their ameliorating antioxidant activities and islet function, promoting muscle glucose uptake and inhibiting the expression of p-ERK."
https://openalex.org/W2895357010,"Assessing theory of mind (ToM) with reliable and valid measures is important, as ToM plays a significant role in children’s social and cognitive functioning. With this in mind, a thorough analysis of the Theory of Mind scale and the Faux Pas Recognition Test was conducted. Over 750 school-age (M age = 7.7) children with disabilities (mild intellectual disability, hearing impairment) and without disabilities took part in our study. The psychometric properties of measures in these groups of children were checked, using confirmatory item factor analysis, reliability, and validity analyses. Thanks to groups’ invariance it was possible to compare mean results of children in the groups. Both measures showed well-fitted models with acceptable goodness of fit as well as scalar and strict invariance. An IRT analysis showed significant differences in the difficulty of the tasks in all groups, but the same order of passing tasks in comparison to other studies, conducted in Western countries, has been observed. Our results showed that the tasks were the easiest for children without disabilities, and most difficult for children with mild intellectual disability. We obtained significant and positive correlations between ToM and social skills and language abilities. The findings are discussed in relation to results from other studies in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2895193251,"Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased risk of development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and early mortality. Fibrosis is the central pathogenic process in CKD and is caused by dysregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. The laminin γ1 chain (LAMC1) is a core structural protein present in the basement membrane of several organs, including the kidneys. We hypothesized that dysregulation of LAMC1 remodeling could be associated with a higher risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. Methods A novel immunoassay targeting LG1M, a specific MMP-9-generated neo-epitope fragment of LAMC1, was developed and used to measure the levels of the fragment in urine and serum from 492 patients from the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) study, a prospective cohort of patients with high-risk CKD. Patients were monitored for a median follow-up time of 3.5 years. Associations between serum and urine LG1M levels and progression of CKD at 12 months were assessed by a multivariable logistic regression model. The association with ESRD or mortality was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Forty-six (11%) of the 416 patients who reached 12-month follow-up had progression of CKD; during the study follow-up, 125 patients (25.4%) developed ESRD and 71 patients (14.4%) died. Serum and urine levels of LG1M correlated with baseline eGFR (r = -0.43, p<0.0001 and r = -0.17, p = 0.0002, respectively). Serum levels of LG1M were higher in patients with one-year progression of CKD compared to those who did not progress (p<0.01). Baseline serum levels of LG1M were associated with development of ESRD (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.99–5.2 for patients in the highest LG1M tertile compared to patient in the lowest tertile). Baseline urinary levels of LG1M (uLG1M) were significantly associated with mortality (HR 5.0, 95% CI 2.8–8.9, p<0.0001 for patients in the highest LG1M tertile compared to patients in the lowest tertile). Urine LG1M was retained in the model for prediction of mortality (HR per standard deviation of uLG1M: 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.02, p = 0.001). Conclusions LG1M, a marker of basement membrane remodeling, is increased in serum and urine of patients with CKD and levels are associated with one-year disease progression, development of ESRD, and mortality."

Objective To estimate the cost of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) attributable to diabetes, stratified by sex, race/skin color, and age, from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system between 2010 and 2016. Methods Population attributable risk (PAR) was calculated from the Brazilian prevalence of diabetes and the relative risk (or odds ratio) of persons with diabetes developing CKD and ESKD as compared to non-diabetic subjects. The variables of interest were sex, race/skin color, and age. A top-down approach was used to measure the direct costs of the disease reimbursed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, using data from outpatient and inpatient records. Results The cost of CKD and ESKD attributable to diabetes in the period 2010–2016 was US$1.2 billion (US$180 million per year) and trending upward. Female sex, age 65–75, and black race/skin color contributed substantially to the costs of CKD and ESKD (US$475 million, US$63 million, and US$25 million respectively). The clinical procedures accounting for the greatest share of disease-attributable costs are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Conclusion Diabetes accounted for 22% of the costs of CKD and ESKD. Female sex, age 65–75 years, and black race/skin color were the variables which contributed most to disease-related expenditure. The economic burden of CKD may increase gradually in the coming years, with serious implications for the financial sustainability of the Brazilian public health system."
https://openalex.org/W2895599996,"Three-dimensional (3D) knee kinematic data, measuring flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation angle variations during locomotion, provide essential information to diagnose, classify, and treat musculoskeletal knee pathologies. However, and so across genders, the curse of dimensionality, intra-class high variability, and inter-class proximity make this data usually difficult to interpret, particularly in tasks such as knee pathology classification. The purpose of this study is to use data complexity analysis to get some insight into this difficulty. Using 3D knee kinematic measurements recorded from osteoarthritis and asymptomatic subjects, we evaluated both single feature complexity, where each feature is taken individually, and global feature complexity, where features are considered simultaneously. These evaluations afford a characterization of data complexity independent of the used classifier and, therefore, provide information as to the level of classification performance one can expect. Comparative results, using reference databases, reveal that knee kinematic data are highly complex, and thus foretell the difficulty of knee pathology classification."
https://openalex.org/W2895086088,"The ability to culture normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) greatly facilitates experiments that seek to understand both normal mammary cell biology and the many differences between normal and abnormal human mammary epithelia. To maximize in vivo relevance, the primary cell culture conditions should maintain cells in states that resemble in vivo as much as possible. Towards this goal, we compared the properties of HMEC strains from two different reduction mammoplasty tissues that were grown in parallel using different media and culture conditions. Epithelial organoids were initiated into three different media: two commonly used serum-free-media, MCDB 170-type (e.g. MEGM) and WIT-P, and a low stress media, M87A. Growth, lineage heterogeneity, p16 protein expression, and population doublings to senescence were measured for each culture condition. MCDB 170 caused rapid senescence and loss of heterogeneity within 2 to 3 passages, but some cultures went through the 1 to 2 month process of selection to generate clonal finite post-selection post-stasis cells. WIT-P caused impressive expansion of luminal cells in 2nd passage followed by their near complete disappearance by passage 4 and senescence shortly thereafter. M87A supported as much as twice the number of population doublings compared to either serum-free medium, and luminal and myoepithelial cells were present for as many as 8 passages. Thus, of the three media compared, WIT-P and MCDB 170 imposed rapid senescence and loss of lineage heterogeneity, phenotypes consistent with cells maintained in high-stress conditions, while M87A supported cultures that maintained multiple lineages and robust growth for up to 60 population doublings. In conjunction with previous studies examining the molecular properties of cultures grown in these media, we conclude that M87A medium is most able to support long-term culture of multiple lineages similar to in vivo conditions, thereby facilitating investigations of normal HMEC biology relevant to the mammary gland in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2895514652,"Cellular transitions and differentiation processes require mRNAs supporting the new phenotype but also the clearance of existing mRNAs for the parental phenotype. Cellular reprogramming from fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) occurs at the early stage of mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) and involves drastic morphological changes. We examined the molecular mechanism for MET, focusing on RNA metabolism. DDX6, an RNA helicase, was indispensable for iPSC formation, in addition to RO60 and RNY1, a non-coding RNA, which form complexes involved in intracellular nucleotide sensing. RO60/RNY1/DDX6 complexes formed prior to processing body formation, which is central to RNA metabolism. The abrogation of DDX6 expression inhibited iPSC generation, which was mediated by RNA decay targeting parental mRNAs supporting mesenchymal phenotypes, along with microRNAs, such as miR-302b-3p. These results show that parental mRNA clearance is a prerequisite for cellular reprogramming and that DDX6 plays a central role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2953271028,"Gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) triggers multiple sclerosis (MS) and the animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Interestingly, MMP-9 is beneficial in systemic autoimmunity caused by Fas-deficiency. Fas-deficient (faslpr) and Fas-ligand-deficient mice are protected against EAE. We here investigated the interaction between Fas and MMP-9 in the setting of induction of EAE and compared short- and long-term effects. We provoked EAE with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide and compared EAE development in four genotypes (wild-type (WT), single knockout mmp-9-/-, faslpr, and mmp-9-/-/faslpr) and monitored leukocytes, cytokines and chemokines as immunological parameters. As expected, faslpr mice were resistant against EAE induction, whereas MMP-9 single knockout mice were not. In the double mmp-9-/-/ faslpr mice the effects on disease scores pointed to independent rather than interrelated disease mechanisms. On a short term, after EAE induction leukocytes infiltrated into the brain and cytokine and chemokine levels were significantly higher in all the four genotypes studied, even in the faslpr and mmp-9-/-/faslpr, which did not develop clinical disease. The levels of MMP-9 but not of MMP-2 were increased in the brain and in the peripheral organs after EAE induction. After 40 days all the animals recovered and did not show signs of EAE. However, the absence of MMP-9 in the remission phase suggested a protective role of MMP-9 in the late phase of the disease, because single mmp-9-/- mice presented a delayed remission in comparison with WT animals suggesting a phase-dependent role of MMP-9 in the disease. Nevertheless, the levels of some cytokines and chemokines remained higher than in control animals even 100 days after EAE induction, attesting to a prolonged state of immune activation. We thus yielded new insights and useful markers to monitor this activated immune status. Furthermore, MMP-9 but not MMP-2 levels remained increased in the brains and, to a higher extend, in the spleens of the WT mice even during the remission phase, which is in line with the role of MMP-9 as a useful marker and a protective factor for EAE in the remission phase."
https://openalex.org/W2895627837,"The critical need to emphasize preterm infant follow-up after neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge assures early identification of and intervention for neurodevelopmental disability. The aims of this study were to observe the follow-up rates in high-risk follow-up clinics, and analyze factors associated with non-compliance to follow-up among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The data was prospectively collected for 3063 VLBW infants between January 2013 and December 2014 from 57 Korean neonatal network (KNN) centers at a corrected age of 18-24 months. Correlations among demographic data, clinical variables, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) volume (divided into 4 quartiles) with the occurrence of non-compliance were analyzed. The overall follow-up rate at the corrected age of 18-24 month was 65.4%. The follow-up rates were inversely related to birth weight and gestational age. Apgar score, hospital stay, maternal age, and maternal education were significantly different between the compliance and non-compliance groups. The follow-up rate was higher for mothers with chorioamnionitis, abnormal amniotic fluid, multiple pregnancy, and in vitro fertilization. Infants with respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus ligation, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity were more common in the compliance group. Follow-up rates showed significant differences according to NICU volume. Using multivariate logistic regression, high birth weight, low NICU volume, siblings, foreign maternal nationality and high 5 min APGAR scores were significant independent factors associated with the non-compliance of VLBW infants for follow-up at 18-24 months of age. This is the first nation-wide analysis of follow-up for VLBW infants in Korea. Understanding factors associated with failure of compliance could help improve the long-term follow-up rates and neurodevelopmental outcomes through early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2894357772,"Objective The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of rectal carriage of plasmid- and chromosome-encoded AmpC β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. in patients in a Dutch teaching hospital between 2013 and 2016. Methods Between 2013 and 2016, hospital-wide yearly prevalence surveys were performed to determine the prevalence of AmpC β-lactamase-producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. rectal carriage. Rectal swabs were taken and cultured using an enrichment broth and selective agar plates. All E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates were screened for production of AmpC β-lactamase using phenotypic confirmation tests and for the presence of plasmid-encoded AmpC (pAmpC) genes. E. coli isolates were screened for chromosome-encoded AmpC (cAmpC) promoter/attenuator alterations. Results Fifty (2.4%) of 2,126 evaluable patients were identified as rectal carrier of AmpC β-lactamase-producing E. coli. No carriage of AmpC β-lactamase producing Klebsiella spp. was found. Nineteen (0.9%) patients harboured isolates with pAmpC genes and 30 (1,4%) patients harboured isolates with cAmpC promoter/attenuator alterations associated with AmpC β-lactamase overproduction. For one isolate, no pAmpC genes or cAmpC promotor/attenuator alterations could be identified. During the study period, a statistically significant decline in the prevalence of rectal carriage with E. coli with cAmpC promotor/attenuator alterations was found (p = 0.012). The prevalence of pAmpC remained stable over the years. Conclusions The prevalence of rectal carriage of AmpC-producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. in patients in Dutch hospitals is low and a declining trend was observed for E. coli with cAmpC promotor/attenuator alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2895560415,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Europe. Survival is poorer in patients admitted to hospitals through the emergency department than in electively admitted patients. Knowledge of factors associated with a cancer diagnosis through presentation at an emergency department may reduce the likelihood of an emergency diagnosis. This study evaluated factors influencing the diagnosis of CRC in the emergency department.This is a cross-sectional study in 5 Spanish regions; subjects were incident cases of CRC diagnosed in 9 public hospitals, between 2006 and 2008. Data were obtained from patient interviews and primary care and hospital clinical records. We found that approximately 40% of CRC patients first contacted a hospital for CRC through an emergency service. Women were more likely than men to be emergency presenters. The type of symptom associated with emergency presentation differed between patients with colon cancer and those with rectal cancer, in that the frequency of ""alarm symptoms"" was significantly lower in colon than in rectal cancer patients who initially presented to emergency services. Soon after symptom onset, some patients went to a hospital emergency service, whereas others contacted their GP. Lack of contact with a GP for CRC-related symptoms was consistently related to emergency presentation. Among patients who contacted a GP, a higher number of consultations for CRC symptoms and any referral to outpatient consultations reduced the likelihood of emergency presentation. All diagnostic time intervals were shorter in emergency presenters than in elective patients.Emergency presenters are not a uniform category and can be divided into categories according to their symptoms, help seeking behavior trajectory and interaction with their GPs. Time constraints for testing and delays in obtaining outpatient appointments led patients to visit a hospital service either on their own or after referral by their GP."
https://openalex.org/W2895031534,"Tissue renewal and muscle regeneration largely rely on the proliferation and differentiation of muscle stem cells called muscular satellite cells (MuSCs). MuSCs are normally quiescent, but they are activated in response to various stimuli, such as inflammation. Activated MuSCs proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and fuse to form multinucleate myofibers. Meanwhile, inappropriate cues for MuSC activation induce premature differentiation and bring about stem cell loss. Recent studies revealed that stem cell regulation is disrupted in various aged tissues. We found that the expression of microRNA (miR)-155, which is an inflammation-associated miR, is upregulated in MuSCs of aged muscles, and this upregulation activates the differentiation process through suppression of C/ebpβ, which is an important molecule for maintaining MuSC self-renewal. We also found that Notch1 considerably repressed miR-155 expression, and loss of Notch1 induced miR-155 overexpression. Our findings suggest that miR-155 can act as an activator of muscular differentiation and might be responsible for accelerating aging-associated premature differentiation of MuSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2894671496,"Although murine models for studying the development of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes mellitus are well established, their reported cardiac phenotypes vary. These reported divergences may, in addition to the severity of different models, also be linked to the methods used for cardiac functional assessment. In the present study, we examined the functional changes using conventional transthoracic echocardiography (in vivo) and isolated heart perfusion techniques (ex vivo), in hearts from two mouse models; one with an overt type 2 diabetes (the db/db mouse) and one with a prediabetic state, where obesity was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Analysis of left ventricular function in the isolated working hearts from HFD-fed mice, suggested that these hearts develop diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function. Accordingly, in vivo examination demonstrated maintained systolic function, but we did not find parameters of diastolic function to be altered. In db/db mice, ex vivo working hearts showed both diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Although in vivo functional assessment revealed signs of diastolic dysfunction, the hearts did not display reduced systolic function. The contrasting results between ex vivo and in vivo function could be due to systemic changes that may sustain in vivo function, or a lack of sensitivity using conventional transthoracic echocardiography. Thus, this study demonstrates that the isolated perfused working heart preparation provides unique additional information related to the development of cardiomyopathy, which might otherwise go unnoticed when only using conventional echocardiographic assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2895191093,"Background The use of the HIV antiretroviral drug stavudine (d4T), a thymidine analogue, is associated with the development of mitochondrial toxicities such as sensory neuropathy (SN). Genetic variation in genes relating to d4T transport and metabolism, as well as genetic variation in the thymidine synthesis pathway, could influence occurrence of d4T-related toxicity. Methods We examined this hypothesis in a cohort of HIV-positive South African adults exposed to d4T, including 143 cases with SN and 120 controls without SN. Ten SNPs in four genes associated with stavudine transport, and 16 SNPs in seven genes of the thymidine synthesis / phosphorylation pathway were genotyped using Agena mass spectrometry methods. Associations between sensory neuropathy and genetic variants were evaluated using PLINK by univariate and multivariable analyses. Results Age and height were significantly associated with SN occurrence. Using logistic regression with age and height as covariates, and uncorrected empirical p-values, genetic variation in SLC28A1, SAMHD1, MTHFR and RRM2B was associated with SN in South Africans using d4T. Conclusion Variation in genes relating to d4T transport and metabolism, as well as genetic variation in the thymidine synthesis pathway may influence occurrence of d4T-related SN. These data contribute to the characterisation of African pharmacogenetic variation and its role in adverse response to antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2895694207,"Demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or transverse myelitis are devastating neurological conditions with no effective cure. Prevention of myelin loss or restoration of myelin are key for successful therapy. To investigate the disease and develop cures animal models with good clinical relevance are essential. The goal of the current study was to establish a model of focal demyelination in the brain of domestic pig using MRI-guided gliotoxin delivery. The rationale for developing a new myelin disease model in the domestic pig was based on the fact that the brain in pigs is anatomically and histologically much more similar to that of humans compared to the rodent brain. For MRI-assisted gliotoxin injection, eight 30 kg pigs were subjected to treatment with lysolecithin (20, 30 mg/ml); or with ethidium bromide (0.0125, 0.05, 0.2 mg/ml). Animals were placed in an MRI scanner for intraparenchymal targeting of gliotoxin into the corona radiata (250 μl over 1h), with real-time monitoring of toxin distribution on T1 scans and monitoring of lesion evolution over seven days using both T1 and T2 scans. After the last MRI, animals were transcardially perfused and brains were processed for histological and immunofluorescent analysis. Gadolinium-enhanced T1 MRI during injection demonstrated biodistribution of the contrast (as a surrogate marker for toxin distribution) and its diffusion through the brain parenchyma. Lesion induction was confirmed on T2-weighted MRI and histopathology, thus enabling the establishment of optimal doses of gliotoxins. To conclude, MRI-guided focal demyelination in swine is accurate and provides real-time confirmation of gliotoxin, thus facilitating placement of focal lesions with high precision. This new model of focal demyelination can be used for further investigation and development of novel therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4232676744,"Objective To characterize anemia and evaluate hematological responses to universal iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation in Ethiopian pregnant women. Method A hospital- based prospective follow up study was done between December 2016 and June 2017. Hematological profiles were measured in pregnant women before and after a minimum of one-month IFA supplementation. Mean values and abnormal proportions of hematological profiles were compared before and after supplementation using paired t-test and McNemar test, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to analyze the association between independent variables and poor treatment responses. Result Lack of adequate hemoglobin response was found in 48.5%(95/196) of the participants. Prevalence of anemia and low hematocrit value were decreased significantly after IFA supplementation (p = 0.002, and p = 0.001, respectively). Normocytic hypochromic anemia was the commonest form of anemia found in this study followed by normocytic normochromic anemia. There was no statistically significant association between poor hemoglobin responses and all studied factors such as educational level, household size, parity, recent illness, stage of pregnancy, coffee consumption, and duration of iron treatment. Conclusion Our study revealed poor hemoglobin responses in nearly half of the study participants and a high proportion of anemias morphologically atypical of iron deficiency anemia. There is a need to consider anemia attributable to etiologies other than an iron deficiency in anemia intervention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2895294239,"The relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) is influenced by several factors. We aimed to investigate the association between COPD, its complication type and rate in patients undergoing PCI.Data were prospectively collected using the Polish Cardiovascular Intervention Society national registry (ORPKI) on all PCIs performed in Poland between January 2015 and December 2016. COPD was present in 5,594 of the 221,187 patients undergoing PCI. We assessed the frequency and predictors of periprocedural complications in PCI.Patients with COPD were elder individuals (70.3 ± 9.9 vs. 67 ± 10.8 years; p < 0.05). We noted 145 (2.6%) periprocedural complications in the COPD group and 4,121 (1.9%) in the non-COPD group (p < 0.001). The higher incidence of periprocedural complications in the COPD patients was mainly attributed to cardiac arrest (p = 0.001), myocardial infarctions (p = 0.002) and no-reflows (p < 0.001). COPD was not an independent predictor of all periprocedural complications. On the other hand, COPD was found to be an independent predictor of increased no-reflow risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.447, 95% CI 1.085-1.929; p = 0.01), and at the same time, of decreased risk of periprocedural allergic reactions (OR 0.117, 95% CI 0.016-0.837; p = 0.03).In conclusion, periprocedural complications of PCIs are more frequent in patients with COPD. COPD is an independent positive predictor of no-reflow and a negative predictor of periprocedural allergic reactions."

This paper aims to explore the control strategy of zero-speed fin stabilizer through a composite method of theoretical analysis, simulations and tank tests. The hydrodynamic force model is established using analytical approach and a simplified model is obtained by fitting the CFD simulation data. The control strategy of zero-speed fin stabilizer is obtained based on disturbance and compensation by analyzing the phase matching relationship between the wave disturbance, the roll motion of the ship, the movement of the fin and the fin-induced hydrodynamic force. Simulations and water tank tests are performed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the obtained control strategies. The results of simulations and tank tests show that the obtained control strategies of zero-speed fin stabilizer based on disturbance and compensation are effective and practical. The proposed method provides theoretical and experimental support for engineering application, and can also be a reference for the controller design of zero-speed fin stabilizers."

https://openalex.org/W2895444722,"Naphthalene causes mouse airway epithelial injury. However, repeated exposures of naphthalene result in mouse airway tolerance. Previous results showed that toxicity or tolerance was correlated with changes of phosphorylcholine-containing lipids. In this study, a mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approach was applied to examine the effects of naphthalene-induced injury or tolerance in the male ICR mice. The injury model was vehicle x 7 plus 300 mg/kg naphthalene while the tolerant one was 200 mg/kg daily x 7 followed by 300 mg/kg naphthalene on day 8. The lung, liver, kidney, and serum samples were collected for profiles of phosphorylcholine-containing lipids including phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and sphingomyelins (SMs). A partial least-square-discriminate analysis model showed different lung phosphorylcholine-containing lipid profiles from the injured, tolerant, and control groups. Perturbation of diacyl-PCs and plasmenylcholines may be associated with enhanced membrane flexibility and anti-oxidative mechanisms in the lungs of tolerant mice. Additionally, alterations of lyso-PCs and SMs may be responsible for pulmonary dysfunction and inflammation in the lungs of injured mice. Moreover, serum PC(16:0/18:1) has potential to reflect naphthalene-induced airway injuries. Few phosphorylcholine-containing lipid alterations were found in the mouse livers and kidneys across different treatments. This study revealed the changes in lipid profiles associated with the perturbations caused by naphthalene tolerance and toxicity; examination of lipids in serum may assist biomarker development with the potential for application in the human population."
https://openalex.org/W2895631526,"In order to determine the role of the adrenergic system in bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity, a series of experiments were performed. In an animal experiment, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under chloral hydrate anesthesia received intravenous bupivacaine, followed by an intravenous injection of adrenalin or isoprenalin, and the electrocardiogram (ECG), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (+dP/dtmax) and the maximum rate of pressure decrease (-dP/dtmax) were continually monitored. In a cellular experiment, freshly isolated adult SD rat ventricular myocytes were perfused with bupivacaine at different concentrations in the presence or absence of isoprenalin, with or without esmolol. The percentage of the sarcomere shortening (bl% peak h), departure velocity (dep v) of sarcomere shortening and time to 50% of the peak speed of myocyte contraction (Tp50) was assessed by a video-based edge-detection system. In an additional experiment, Swiss mice pretreated with saline, isoprenalin, esmolol or dexmedetomidine received bupivacaine to determine the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of bupivacaine. Electron microscopy of myocardial mitochondria was performed to assess damage of these structures. To test mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, freshly isolated SD rat ventricular myocytes were incubated with bupivacaine in the presence of isoprenalin, with or without esmolol. First, our results showed that bupivacaine significantly reduced the LVSP and +dP/dtmax, as well as enhanced the LVEDP and -dP/dtmax (P < 0.05, vs. control, and vs. baseline). Adrenalin and isoprenalin induced a further reduction of LVSP and +dP/dtmax (P < 0.05, vs. before adrenalin or isoprenalin delivery, and vs. control). Second, bupivacaine induced a dose-dependent cardiomyocyte contractile depression. While 5.9 μmol/L or 8.9 μmol/L of bupivacaine resulted in no change, 30.0 μmol/L of bupivacaine prolonged the Tp50 and reduced the bl% peak h and dep v (P < 0.05, vs. control and vs. baseline). Isoprenalin aggravated the bupivacaine-induced cardiomyocyte contractile depression, significantly prolonging the Tp50 (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone) and reducing the dep v (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone). Third, esmolol and dexmedetomidine significantly enhanced, while isoprenalin significantly reduced, the LD50 of bupivacaine in mice. Fourth, bupivacaine led to significant mitochondrial swelling, and the extent of myocardial mitochondrial swelling in isoprenalin-pretreated mice was significantly higher than that compared with mice pretreated with saline, as reflected by the higher mitochondrial damage score (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, esmolol pretreatment significantly reduced the mitochondrial damage score (P < 0.01). Fifth, bupivacaine significantly increased the ROS in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes, and added isoprenalin induced a further enhancement of ROS production (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine alone). Added esmolol significantly decreased ROS production (P < 0.05, vs. bupivacaine + isoprenalin). Our results suggest that bupivacaine depressed cardiac automaticity, conductivity and contractility, but the predominant effect was contractile dysfunction which resulted from the disruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism. β-adrenergic activation aggravated the cellular metabolism disorder and therefore contractile dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2894369042,"Epidemiological studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and support a role for vitamin D signalling in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction. Vitamin D deficiency results in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, however, the role of secondary hyperparathyroidism in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction is not known. Here, we aimed to explore further the secondary hyperparathyroidism independent role of vitamin D signalling in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction by inducing experimental myocardial infarction in 3-month-old, male, wild-type mice and in mice lacking a functioning vitamin D receptor. In order to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism in vitamin D receptor mutant mice, all mice were maintained on a rescue diet enriched with calcium, phosphorus, and lactose. Surprisingly, survival rate, cardiac function as measured by echocardiography and intra-cardiac catheterisation and cardiomyocyte size were indistinguishable between normocalcaemic vitamin D receptor mutant mice and wild-type controls, 2 and 8 weeks post-myocardial infarction. In addition, the myocardial infarction-induced inflammatory response was similar in vitamin D receptor mutants and wild-type mice, as evidenced by a comparable upregulation in cardiac interleukin-1-β and tumor-necrosis-factor-α mRNA abundance and similar elevations in circulating interleukin-1-β and tumor-necrosis-factor-α. Our data suggest that the lack of vitamin D signalling in normocalcaemic vitamin D receptor mutants has no major detrimental effect on cardiac function and outcome post-myocardial infarction. Our study may have important clinical implications because it suggests that the secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by vitamin D deficiency, rather than the lack of vitamin D signalling per se, may negatively impact cardiac function post-myocardial infarction."

All patients were evaluated following the STAF scoring criteria and were classified according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) etiology classification criteria. A total of 317 patients were enrolled, including 37 CE cases (11.67%). STAF ≥5 showed a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 91% for the diagnosis of CE, whereas DD >791.30 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 58% and a specificity of 78%. When the STAF was used in combination with the DD level, the sensitivity was 95%, and the specificity was 100%.STAF score is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of CE when combined with DD, and can facilitate the etiological classification of acute ischemic stroke."

Treatment of J/Neo cells with NOC, 2-MeO-E2, or CPT caused cytotoxicity and apoptotic DNA fragmentation but these events were significantly attenuated in the presence of CMEP-NQ. Although not only MDA (NOC or 2-MeO-E2)-induced mitotic arrest, CDK1 activation, and BCL-2, BCL-XL and BIM phosphorylation, but also DDA (CPT)-induced S-phase arrest and ATM-CHK1/CHK2-p53 pathway activation were not or were barely affected in the presence of CMEP-NQ, the levels of anti-apoptotic BAG3 and MCL-1, which were markedly downregulated after MDA- or DDA-treatment, were rather elevated by CMEP-NQ. Under the same conditions, MDA- or DDA-induced mitochondrial apoptotic events including BAK activation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) loss, caspase-9 activation, and PARP cleavage were significantly inhibited by CMEP-NQ. While MDA- or DDA-induced sub-G1 peak and Δψm loss were abrogated in J/BCL-XL cells, MDA-induced mitotic arrest and DDA-induced S-arrest were more apparent in J/BCL-XL cells than in J/Neo cells. Simultaneously, the induced cell cycle arrest in J/BCL-XL cells was not significantly disturbed by CMEP-NQ. MDA- or DDA-treatment caused intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; however, MDA- or DDA-induced ROS production was almost completely abrogated in J/BCL-XL cells. MDA- or DDA-induced ROS production in J/Neo cells was significantly suppressed by CMEP-NQ, but the suppressive effect was hardly observed in J/BCL-XL cells. Together, these results show that CMEP-NQ efficiently protects Jurkat T cells from apoptotic cell death via the elevation of BAG3 and MCL-1 levels, which results in the inhibition of intrinsic BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, as does the overexpression of BCL-XL."
https://openalex.org/W2895663390,"While having high bandwidth-efficiency, the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol suffers from high signaling overhead due to route request (RREQ) messages flooding, especially when the node density and the number of connections are increased. In order to resolve this broadcast storm problem of the AODV in a high node density mobile ad-hoc network, we propose a geographical on-demand route discovery scheme. Assuming a known location of the destination, the RREQ of the proposed routing protocol is propagated in a unicast manner by employing a novel parsing mechanism for possible duplicate RREQs. The routing overhead of the proposed routing protocol is greatly robust to the node density change. We derive the node density required for the proposed routing protocol to keep the same connectivity as the AODV under the circumstance where the nodes are uniformly distributed. In addition, we present an imaginary destination consideration method to incorporate the uncertainty of the destination's location due to mobility. Computer simulations show that the proposed scheme enables the RREQ propagation to cover 95% of the one-hop communication area centered at the originally known location of the destination without sacrificing the unicast feature."

The Vyegwa-Gika Pygmies were forced to migrate from rainforests to the savanna, changing quickly their environment, culture, and socio-economic situation. Despite the high level of poverty they suffer in this new settlement, we found evidence of strong altruistic attitudes toward trustees when playing an economic game. In addition, Vyegwa-Gika Pygmies keep small personal trust networks despite the fact they share frequent social interactions within the community. These results indicate the great effectiveness of personal trust in fostering altruism, even if the circumstances make it difficult to establish such kind of affective bonds. A theory of the evolution of altruism should therefore also account for the evolution of psychology of trust, as a key element in the process."
