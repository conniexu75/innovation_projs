The respiration rate of C. acrolepis was two orders of magnitude lower and that of E. deani was significantly lower (P < .05) than rates in comparable shallow-water species."

The legend should read Fig. 5. Direct solar UV irradiance and scattered UV irradiance on a horizontal surface at sea level for solar zenith angles θ of 0°, 30°, 60°, and 75° and 0.341 atm-cm of total ozone [data from (10)]."
https://openalex.org/W1987562807,"The Sunken Forest, located on Fire Island, a barrier island in the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island, New York, is an ecosystem in which most of the basic cation input is in the form of salt spray. This meteorologic input is sufficient to compensate for the lack of certain nutrients in the highly weathered sandy soils. In other ecosystems these nutrients are generally supplied by weathering of soil particles. The compensatory effect of meteorologic input allows for primary production rates in the Sunken Forest similar to those of inland temperate forests."

At the same time women in underdeveloped countries began adopting the Western fad of bottle feeding their infants. Resumption of breast-feeding in the United States seems to be a reaction against impersonal medical practices which separate mothers from their babies. Third World women have moved toward bottle feeding as a status symbol. This is an unfortunate development. Cows milk in those countries is neither cheap nor hygienic. With the increase in bottle-feeding has come increased malnutrition in very young babies an age when good nutrition is important for brain development. Breast-feeding can also serve as a fairly effective contraceptive.

Because of the short half-lives of the polonium isotopes involved, it is not clear how polonium halos may be explained on the basis of currently accepted cosmological models of Earth formation."

https://openalex.org/W2090361114,"IT is the speaker's desire, in this paper, to touch briefly on some phases of geodesy which should be of general interest to the physicist. Geodesy is one of the oldest sciences; probably second in this respect to astronomy alone. What is the extent of the earth in the horizontal plane, to what depth does it extend, and what is on the other side are questions which must have been asked by men of the earliest times. The history of geodesy will have to be passed over, for lack of time, although it would be interesting to follow the accumulation of data as to the shape and size of the earth. Before one can study efficiently the great geophysical facts and comprehend them, he must know the shape and size of the earth with considerable accuracy. For some time before the end of the seventeenth century, it was taken for granted that the earth was a true sphere. The announcement by Newton in 1687 of his theory that the earth was an oblate spheroid added much interest to the subject of its exact shape. A meridional arc of about 8i degrees, extending north and south of Paris, was measured by J. and D. Cassini between the years 1683 and 1716. The results of the first computations of this arc indicated that the length of the degree was less at the northern than at the southern end. This gave to the earth the shape of a prolate spheroid. A great controversy arose over"
