https://openalex.org/W2021338594,"Malaria control in Africa is most tractable in urban settlements yet most research has focused on rural settings. Elimination of malaria transmission from urban areas may require larval control strategies that complement adult mosquito control using insecticide-treated nets or houses, particularly where vectors feed outdoors.Microbial larvicide (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti)) was applied weekly through programmatic, non-randomized community-based, but vertically managed, delivery systems in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Continuous, randomized cluster sampling of malaria infection prevalence and non-random programmatic surveillance of entomological inoculation rate (EIR) respectively constituted the primary and secondary outcomes surveyed within a population of approximately 612,000 residents in 15 fully urban wards covering 55 km(2). Bti application for one year in 3 of those wards (17 km(2) with 128,000 residents) reduced crude annual transmission estimates (Relative EIR [95% Confidence Interval] = 0.683 [0.491-0.952], P = 0.024) but program effectiveness peaked between July and September (Relative EIR [CI] = 0.354 [0.193 to 0.650], P = 0.001) when 45% (9/20) of directly observed transmission events occurred. Larviciding reduced malaria infection risk among children < or =5 years of age (OR [CI] = 0.284 [0.101 to 0.801], P = 0.017) and provided protection at least as good as personal use of an insecticide treated net (OR [CI] = 0.764 [0.614-0.951], P = 0.016).In this context, larviciding reduced malaria prevalence and complemented existing protection provided by insecticide-treated nets. Larviciding may represent a useful option for integrated vector management in Africa, particularly in its rapidly growing urban centres."

Regulated proteolysis of APP generates biologically active fragments such as the neuroprotective secreted ectodomain sAPPα and the neurotoxic β-amyloid peptide. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the intact transmembrane APP plays a signaling role, which might be important for both normal synaptic plasticity and neuronal dysfunction in dementia. To understand APP signaling, we tracked single molecules of APP using quantum dots and quantitated APP homodimerization using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy for the detection of Förster resonance energy transfer in living neuroblastoma cells. Using selective labeling with synthetic fluorophores, we show that the dimerization of APP is considerably higher at the plasma membrane than in intracellular membranes. Heparan sulfate significantly contributes to the almost complete dimerization of APP at the plasma membrane. Importantly, this technique for the first time structurally defines the initiation of APP signaling by binding of a relevant physiological extracellular ligand; our results indicate APP as receptor for neuroprotective sAPPα, as sAPPα binding disrupts APP dimers, and this disruption of APP dimers by sAPPα is necessary for the protection of neuroblastoma cells against starvation-induced cell death. Only cells expressing reversibly dimerized wild-type, but not covalently dimerized mutant APP are protected by sAPPα. These findings suggest a potentially beneficial effect of increasing sAPPα production or disrupting APP dimers for neuronal survival.

Despite intensive research efforts, the initial events that lead to the prevalent sporadic, i.e. non-familial, forms of AD are still unclear. Furthermore, although a higher gene dose of APP (9Rovelet-Lecrux A. Hannequin D. Raux G. Le Meur N. Laquerrière A. Vital A. Dumanchin C. Feuillette S. Brice A. Vercelletto M. Dubas F. Frebourg T.

Some fragments of APP, such as the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), are thought to contribute to synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity (11Gong Y.S. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P. Finch C.E.

The most common form of signal transduction for single-pass transmembrane proteins is the ligand-induced perturbation of a monomer/dimer equilibrium. Indeed, the dimerization of transmembrane APP has been implied several times in the past. Several studies have investigated the effects of presumed dimer-breaking perturbations on biological read-outs, such as the production of Aβ (27Kaden D. Münter L.M. Joshi M. Treiber C. Weise C.

In the studies investigating the aggregation state of full-length APP, most of the employed methods, such as chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation, do not lend themselves readily to a rigorous quantitative analysis of the abundance of potentially instable dimers (31Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3624-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), whereas in other cases the use of chimeras may have influenced the dimerization potential or precluded the search for a natural stimulus (23Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Chiba T. Tsukamoto E. Kadowaki H. Nishitoh H. Yamagishi Y. Ishizaka M. Yamada M. Nawa M. Terashita K. Aiso S. Ichijo H. Nishimoto I. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The only previously reported direct observation of APP dimerization by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy uses an assay in which the FRET efficiency varies with the level of overexpression (35Münter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Therefore, a concentration-dependent FRET component due to nonspecific stochastic encounters cannot be excluded in this study. Most importantly, as none of the published procedures permitted the selective detection of APP dimers on the surface of live cells, where they would encounter ligands, they could not differentiate between subpopulations of APP. This may be one reason why no natural ligand of APP has ever been shown to signal via modulation of its monomer/dimer equilibrium. Another elusive goal is the identity of the receptor for neuroprotective sAPPα (36Ninomiya H. Roch J.M. Jin L.W. Saitoh T. J.

Plasmids—pcDNA3-mGFP was obtained by cloning monomerized enhanced GFP (L222K mutation (41Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y.

APP-mGFP was derived by inserting APP695 into the EcoRV and NotI sites of pcDNA3-mGFP; an AAAG linker connects the C terminus of APP to the N terminus of mGFP. For substitution of the fluorophore, mGFP was excised using NotI and ApaI; mCherry ((42Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat.

The K624C mutants were produced by using QuikChange on the XhoI-NotI fragment of APP-mGFP and inserting the mutant fragment back into a wild-type vector (K624C-APP-mGFP and K624C-APP-mCherry). APP-ACP-mGFP and K624C-APP-ACP-mGFP were obtained by silent mutation of APP695 codons 294–295 in the EcoRV-XhoI fragment of APP-mGFP to introduce an NheI site (GCCAGT to GCTAGC) and insertion of acyl carrier protein (ACP; Covalys Biosciences AG, Witterswil, Switzerland), and amplified using NheI-encoding forward and backward primers into the corresponding site thus created. ACP was, therefore, inserted in a similar position as the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain, which occurs in non-neuronal isoforms of APP. The EcoRV-XhoI fragment was then inserted into either wild-type APP-mGFP or K624C-APP-mGFP. To eliminate mGFP from these vectors, wild-type APP-ACP and K624C-APP-ACP were obtained by digestion with NotI and PspOMI followed by religation. The entire open reading frames of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing (SeqLab, Göttingen, Germany). Cell Culture—B103 neuroblastoma cells were a kind gift from Dr. David Schubert (Salk Institute). APP or APP-like protein 2 cannot be detected in these cells (44Schubert D. Behl C. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 105 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum on poly-l-ornithine-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA) and transfected using 0.2–0.8 μg of plasmid DNA per well and magnetic nanoparticle MaTra beads on a 24-magnet plate (beads and magnet from IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). The medium was changed 1–2 h after transfection, and expression was allowed to proceed for a further 16–24 h. MaTra transfection was superior to several liposomal transfection methods in replicating the expression pattern of endogenous APP and in maintaining cell morphology (data not shown). For mGFP imaging, coverslips were washed by a short immersion in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on a drop of imaging buffer (135 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20% glucose) using a homemade silicone rubber gasket on a glass slide. For ACP imaging, coverslips were incubated for 20 h at 16 °C in a humidified atmosphere in imaging buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm wild-type ACP synthase (purified according to instructions from Covalys Biosciences AG, Witterswil, Switzerland), and CoA dyes (Covalys) at a concentration of 1 μm CoA-488 and 3 μm CoA-547, where indicated. They were then thoroughly washed twice by immersion in phosphate-buffered saline and draining off the excess liquid and mounted in imaging buffer as for mGFP imaging. Where indicated, 1 μm recombinant human sAPPα695 or sAPPa770 (45Gralle M. Botelho M.M. de Oliveira C.L.P. Torriani I. Ferreira S.T. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3513-3524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was added to the imaging buffer after removal of the dyes. The measurements started ∼10 h after the addition of sAPPα to the cells. To remove cell surface heparin, cells were incubated for 2 h with 2 units/ml heparinase I (Sigma-Aldrich) in complete medium before labeling; heparinase was also present during labeling with CoA dyes. For quantum dot experiments, 1 μm CoA coupled to biotin was used. After washing, the cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of streptavidin-coated 585-nm and/or 655-nm emitting quantum dots (Invitrogen) (46Lidke D.S. Nagy P. Jovin T.M. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 69-79PubMed Google Scholar). In survival experiments, B103 cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of a yellow fluorescent protein construct (TN-XXL, a kind gift of Oliver Griesbeck, MPI for Biochemistry, Munich) and 0.2 μg of either pcDNA3, pcDNA3-APP, or pcDNA3-K624C-APP per well using MaTra. 6 h after transfection wells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and filled either with imaging buffer or with imaging buffer containing 16 nm sAPPα770. In some experiments 24 h after transfection another 16 nm were added to the same wells. Microscopy—Fluorescence lifetime imaging measurements were performed on a frequency domain setup (47Esposito A. Gerritsen H.C. Wouters F.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 4286-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using an argon laser (Innova 304C, Coherent, Dieburg, Germany) at 488 nm (mGFP) or 496 nm (CoA-488). The presence of other fluorophores was confirmed using mercury lamp excitation. All filter cubes were from AHF (Tübingen, Germany) with the following components: mGFP dichroic LP495, emission BP 515/30; CoA-488 dichroic LP515, emission BP 535/30; CoA-547 excitation BP 545/30, dichroic LP565, emission BP615/75; mCherry excitation BP530–585, dichroic LP600, emission BP615. mGFP imaging was performed at 22 °C; ACP imaging was performed at 16 °C to slow down internalization of the labeled APP, necessary to image APP at the cell surface. Eight-phase step images were acquired in random order. Confocal microscopy was performed at room temperature on a Zeiss LSM-510 Meta instrument using laser excitation at 488 or 633 nm and a 63× water immersion objective or on a programmable array microscope fitted on an Olympus IX71 microscope using laser excitation at 488 nm and a 150× oil immersion objective (48Hagen G.M. Caarls W. Thomas M. Hill A. Lidke K.A. Rieger B. Fritsch C. Van Geest B. Jovin T.M. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Proc. SPIE. 2007; 6441: 64410SCrossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Quantum dot tracking was performed using the View5D plugin (Rainer Heintzmann, King's College, London) for ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and diffusion coefficients were calculated from the exported coordinates as described before (49Lidke D.S. Nagy P. Barisas B.G. Heintzmann R. Post J.N. Lidke K.A. Clayton A.H.A. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Jovin T.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—In mGFP images, the optimal threshold was set automatically (opthr module for MatLab by F. T. Marti). All further operations were performed with custom-written routines (Alessandro Esposito and M. Gralle) in MatLab (Math-Works, Natick, MT). ACP images were manually threshold to the smallest mask that includes the entire cell body; a contour mask was then applied that extended 10 pixels inward from the boundaries of the threshold mask to isolate the plasma membrane. The lifetime and total intensity values of each pixel in the threshold mask (mGFP) or contour mask (ACP) were stored together with an estimate of the background fluorescence (median intensity of the pixels outside the threshold mask). For each pixel, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was calculated as the quotient of its total intensity over the background fluorescence in the image. SNRs and apparent lifetimes for all pixels in the appropriate masks of all cells were joined for each experimental condition and imported into IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, Oregon) for fitting. ACP Regression Analysis—As the ACP labeling creates a small but non-negligible nonspecific background fluorescence, the lifetime of specifically labeled APP (τ) and the nonspecific background (τb) for each condition were estimated by fitting SNR and apparent lifetimes (τapp) in all pixels toτapp=(τb−τ)/SNR+τ(Eq. 1) The parameter τb was linked in a global fit across all experimental conditions, returning a value of 3.55 ns. Histograms show the corrected lifetimes, obtained by inversion of (1Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rulicke T. Kretzschmar H. von Koch C. Sisodia S. Tremml P. Lipp H.P.

These histograms were fitted to a Gaussian distribution using the IgorPro inbuilt function. We investigated the oligomerization state of APP in living B103 neuroblastoma cells by measuring FRET (50Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (51Esposito A. Gerritsen H.C. Oggier T. Lustenberger F. Wouters F.S. J. Biomed. Opt. 2006; 11: 034016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This technique is able to detect the association of proteins in their natural, unperturbed environment. The association of the donor with the acceptor fluorophore is reflected in a characteristic reduction in the excited state lifetime of the donor. In our initial experiments, we used APP-mGFP as donor and APP-mCherry as acceptor. APP-mGFP displays a largely vesicular staining localized predominantly to perinuclear membranes, most likely the secretory compartments (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus), which is identical to the distribution of APP in cells that express it endogenously (52Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A, B, and E). APP-mCherry localizes to the same cell compartments (Fig. 1F). The excited state lifetime of the mGFP fluorophore in APP-mGFP in the absence of acceptor is homogeneous, with a mean lifetime of 2.37 ± 0.01 ns (Fig. 1D). In the presence of APP-mCherry, however, the lifetime of APP-mGFP decreases to a mean value of 2.17 ± 0.01 ns, corresponding to a FRET efficiency of 8.3 ± 0.6% (Fig. 1G). This indicates that a portion of the co-localizing APP-mGFP and APP-mCherry molecules is closer together than 10 nm, i.e. physically interacts (50Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Coexpression of APP-mGFP with APP-REACh2 (43Ganesan S. Ameer-beg S.M. Ng T.T.C. Vojnovic B. Wouters F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4089-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) resulted in similar results (data not shown). It is important to note that much less FRET was observed in formaldehyde-fixed cells. This suggests that the association of APP molecules is labile and can easily be disturbed and disrupted by changes in the membrane environment. This apparent instability could explain why only very low amounts of dimerized APP are observed in cell lysates (31Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To allow an interpretation of FRET efficiency in terms of degree of association, we employed a standard that is quantitatively dimerized. The K624C mutant of APP has been shown to form disulfide-bridged dimers and to dimerize quantitatively (31Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as the B103 cell line does not contain detectable levels of endogenous APP or related APP-like proteins (44Schubert D. Behl C. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it can be assumed that APP-mCherry only competes with other APP-mGFP molecules for binding to APP-mGFP. Mutant APP-mGFP displayed a mean lifetime of 2.06 ± 0.02 ns in the presence of mutant acceptor APP-mCherry, corresponding to a FRET efficiency of 13.1 ± 1.0% (Fig. 1H). The FRET efficiency of wild-type APP corresponds to ∼65% of the quantitatively dimerized mutant. Because the fluorophores are expected to undergo little orientation restriction at the ends of the unstructured cytoplasmic domain of APP (53Kroenke C.D. Ziemnicka-Kotula D. Xu J. Kotula L. Palmer 3rd, A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8145-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the presence of the mutation in the transmembrane domain of APP does not noticeably affect the FRET coupling of the fluorophores. Moreover, as the proportion of APP-mGFP to APP-mCherry is the same for both mutant and wild-type forms, the degree of association is proportional to the FRET efficiency. It can, therefore, be concluded that wild-type cellular APP is 35% monomeric (Figs. 1H and 3), with the rest being dimers, as suggested from x-ray diffraction and scattering studies of APP fragments (32Wang Y. Ha Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 40Gralle M. Oliveira C.L.P. Guerreiro L.H. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Masters C.L. Cappai R.

Although intracellular APP may already be cleaved to biologically active fragments (54Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 55Skovronsky D.M. Moore D.B. Milla M.E. Doms R.W. Lee E.B. J. Biol.

Anandatheerthavarada H.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9057-9068Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), only plasmalemmal APP can act as receptor for extracellular molecules or metal ions. The strong signal of intracellular APP-mGFP prevented us from detecting an effect for several extracellular ligands on the aggregation state of APP (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The quantity of cell surface APP is tightly regulated by its very rapid turnover (57Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol"

We have generated a bicistronic Cre/LoxP reporter mouse line that pairs the expression of firefly luciferase with quantifiable expression of a human placental alkaline phosphatase that is secreted into the serum (SeAP). With the use of this dual-modality bioreporter with a novel, inducible Pax7-CreER line for tracking muscle satellite cells, we demonstrate the longitudinal kinetics of muscle stem cell turnover, accounting for a doubling of the signal from satellite cell and progeny every 3.93 wk in the transition from adolescence to early adulthood. We also show that this dual-modality bioreporter can be incorporated in preclinical cancer models, whereby SeAP activity is reflective of tumor burden. Thus, this dual bioreporter permits both spatial localization and accurate quantification of biological processes in vivo even when the tissue of interest is deep within the animal."
https://openalex.org/W2036179978,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand cell surface receptor, and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is one of the ligands for RAGE. Because RAGE is a transporter of Abeta from the blood to the brain, RAGE is believed to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In the present study, the role of RAGE in Abeta production was examined in the brain tissue of an AD animal model, Tg2576 mice, as well as cultured cells. Because beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an essential protease for Abeta production, is up-regulated in cells overexpressing RAGE and in RAGE-injected brains of Tg2576 mice, the molecular mechanisms underlying RAGE, BACE1 expression, and Abeta production were examined. Because RAGE stimulates intracellular calcium, nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFAT1) was examined. NFAT1 was activated following RAGE-induced BACE1 expression followed by Abeta generation. Injection of soluble RAGE (sRAGE), which acts as a competitor with full-length RAGE (fRAGE), into aged Tg2576 mouse brains reduced the levels of plaques, Abeta, BACE1, and the active form of NFAT1 compared with fRAGE-injected Tg2576 mice. Taken together, RAGE stimulates functional BACE1 expression through NFAT1 activation, resulting in more Abeta production and deposition in the brain."

The liver is the primary organ for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, including gluconeogenesis, glycogenesis, cholesterol biosynthesis, and lipogenesis (1Fritsche L. Weigert C. Haring H.U.

These metabolic events in the liver are tightly controlled by several pancreatic hormones including insulin and glucagon. In addition, the liver itself is one of the largest endocrine organs in the body, secreting numerous humoral factors involved in the regulation of systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis. The importance of the liver-derived humoral factors in maintaining glucose metabolism is highlighted by the observation that glucose uptake by skeletal muscle is severely impaired by surgical or pharmacological blockade of hepatic parasympathetic nerves (3Xie H.

To search for novel liver-derived secretory factors involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, we used microarray analysis as a global screening for systematic identification of genes differentially expressed in the liver of C57BLKS db/db mice (a genetically inherited diabetic mouse model that is characterized by severe insulin resistance and hyperglycemia) and their lean littermates. We found that the mRNA level of mouse major urinary protein-1 (MUP-1) 2The abbreviations used are: MUP, major urinary protein; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; PGC1α, PPARγ coactivator 1α; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. was markedly down-regulated in db/db mice, and the change was largely normalized upon treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. MUP-1 is a small molecular weight secreted protein abundantly expressed in the liver (14McIntosh I. Bishop J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Its expression in the liver is enhanced by administration of the hepatotoxic agent dimethylnitrosamine (15Bhattacharjee A. Lappi V.R. Rutherford M.S. Schook L.B. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 150: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but is reduced by interleukin 6-induced acute phase response in mice (16Gervois P. Kleemann R. Pilon A. Percevault F. Koenig W. Staels B. Kooistra T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16154-16160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Like other members of the MUP family, MUP-1 has been proposed to act as a pheromone-binding protein in urine (17Chamero P. Marton T.F. Logan D.W. Flanagan K. Cruz J.R. Saghatelian A. Cravatt B.F. Stowers L. Nature. 2007; 450: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), thereby accelerating puberty and promoting aggressive behavior in male mice. However, the precise functions of MUPs have yet to be determined. MUP-1 belongs to the lipocalin superfamily, the members of which share a common tertiary structure with a cup-shaped hydrophobic ligand binding pocket surrounded by an eight-stranded β-barrel (18Flower D.R. North A.C. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 19Hoo R.L. C. Y.D. Lam K.S. Xu A. Expert Rev. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 3: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This structure confers upon lipocalins the ability to bind and transport a wide variety of small lipophilic substances, including fatty acids, cholesterols, prostaglandins, and pheromones. Noticeably, several members of the lipocalin family, including RBP4, lipocalin-2, and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP), have recently been shown to be important mediators of obesity-related insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (8Yang Q.

Unlike MUP-1, the expression of RBP4, lipocalin-2, and A-FABP are elevated in obesity and diabetes (9Polonsky K.S. N. Engl. J.

Our results demonstrated that MUP-1 was abundantly present in the circulation. In genetic and dietary obese mouse models, the serum and urine concentrations of MUP-1 were remarkably decreased. Replenishment of recombinant MUP-1 led to improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as increased energy expenditure and locomotor activity in db/db diabetic mice. Our data suggest that MUP-1 not only serves as a circulating biomarker, negatively correlated with obesity-related metabolic disorders, but also plays an active role in regulating energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in mice. Animal Studies—C57BL/6J mice and C57BKS db/db diabetic mice were housed in a room under controlled temperature (23 ± 1 °C), with free access to water and standard mouse chow (LabDiet 5053, LabDiet, Purina Mills, Richmond, IN). To establish a dietary obese mouse model, 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a 19.33 kJ/g high fat diet (D12451, Research Diet, New Brunswick, NJ) containing 45 Kcal % fat, 20 Kcal % protein, and 35 Kcal % carbohydrate for 10 weeks as described previously (24Xu A.

For the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, mice that were fasted overnight (16 h) were given a glucose load by intraperitoneal injection (1 g of glucose/kg of body weight). For the insulin tolerance test, mice were starved for 6 h and then injected intraperitoneally with insulin (0.5 unit/kg of body weight). For the pyruvate tolerance test, mice were starved for 16 h and were then injected intraperitoneally with pyruvate (2 g/kg) dissolved in saline. Blood glucose levels were determined in tail blood every 30 min for 2 h using the Ascensia Elite XL blood glucose meter (Bayer HealthCare). To evaluate the metabolic effects of MUP-1, the recombinant MUP-1 protein was delivered into the mice using Alzet™ osmotic pumps (DURECT Corp., Cupertino, CA) as described previously (25Wang Y. Lam K.S. Chan L. Chan K.W. Lam J.B. Lam M.C. Hoo R.C. Mak W.W. Cooper G.J. Xu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16391-16400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted under our institutional guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory animals. Indirect Calorimetry—Mice were housed individually in metabolic chambers maintained at 22 °C on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with lights on at 7 a.m. Metabolic measurements (food intake, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, and core body temperature) were recorded continuously using a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments). Spontaneous locomotor activity was monitored at the same time as the indirect calorimetry, continuously over the measurement period by infrared beam sensors, separated by 0.54 cm from each other. Expression and Purification of Recombinant MUP-1 in Escherichia coli—cDNA from the male mouse liver was used as the template for cloning the gene encoding full-length MUP-1, which does not include the secretory signal peptide (amino acids 1–18). The primer sequences used for cloning were 5′-CCGCTGGATCCGAAGAAGC TAGTTCTACGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGTC TCGAGTCATTCTCGGGCCTGGAGG-3′ (reverse), respectively. After digestion with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI, the DNA fragment was purified and subcloned into pPROEX-Htb bacterial expression vector (Invitrogen). The gene fragment was inserted in-frame to an N-terminal His6 tag and was verified by DNA sequencing. The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)-codon plus RILP-competent cells for expression of recombinant MUP-1, which was purified by using an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described previously (22Furuhashi M. Tuncman G. Gorgun C.Z. Makowski L. Atsumi G. Vaillancourt E. Kono K. Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Sulsky R. Robl J.A. Parker R.A. Hotamisligil G.S.

Production of Polyclonal Antibody against Mouse MUP-1 in Rabbits—The anti-mouse MUP-1 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunization of New Zealand female rabbits using recombinant MUP-1 as described (26Wang Y.

Anti-mouse MUP-1 IgG was purified from the serum of immunized rabbits with protein G beads followed by affinity chromatography with recombinant mouse MUP-1 as the ligand. Measurement of Serum and Urinary MUP-1 by In-house ELISA—Affinity-purified anti-MUP-1 IgG was biotinylated with a sulfo-NHS-biotin kit (Pierce), and the biotinylated IgG was used as the detection antibody. Unlabeled anti-MUP-1 IgG was used as the capture antibody for coating a 96-well microtiter plate overnight at 4 °C at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Mouse serum samples were diluted in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Then 100 μl of the diluted samples or recombinant MUP-1 standards were applied to each well, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with a wash buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and then incubated with 100 μl of the detection antibody (0.15 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times, the wells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 20 min and subsequently reacted with tetramethylbenzidine reagent for 15 min. 50 μl of 0.5 m H2SO4 was added to each well to stop the reaction, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Enzyme Activity Assays—Frozen adipose tissue, muscle, or liver samples were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2. Citrate synthase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.3 mm acetyl CoA, and 0.5 mm oxaloacetate. The rate of change in absorbance was monitored at 412 nm. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase was analyzed by measuring the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c with a commercially available cytochrome c oxidase assay kit (Sigma) as described (27Zhou M. Xu A. Tam P.K. Lam K.S. Chan L. Hoo R.L. Liu J. Chow K.H. Wang Y. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Extraction of Total RNA and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from various tissues of mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with an ImProm-II™ reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using GreenER™ qPCR Supermix with specific primers (Invitrogen) or TaqMan Master Mix with Assay-On-Demand™ primers and probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reactions were carried out on a 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was quantified by comparing the ratio of cytochrome b (mitochondrial marker) to the genomic β-actin DNA quantity as described (27Zhou M. Xu A. Tam P.K. Lam K.S. Chan L. Hoo R.L. Liu J. Chow K.H. Wang Y. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used for quantification of each gene and mtDNA are listed in supplemental Table 1. Western Blotting—Mice serum or recombinant MUP-1 was resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was blocked with 10% (w/v) milk and probed with a primary antibody against mouse MUP-1 at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibody, the proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare). Statistics—All of the data obtained in this study are represented as means ± S.D. The statistical calculations were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 11.5, software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Differences between groups were determined by an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. MUP-1 Expression in the Liver Is Markedly Decreased in db/db Diabetic/Obese Mice and Is Up-regulated after Treatment with Rosiglitazone or Refeeding—To identify novel genes differentially expressed under diabetic/obese conditions, we used microarray analysis for global comparison of expression profiles in the liver tissue between lean mice and C57BLKS db/db mice (a genetically inherited obese mouse model with frank diabetes). Our results showed that the expression of a gene encoding MUP-1, a secreted protein comprising of 180 amino acid residues (GenBank™ accession number NM_0311881), was markedly decreased by ∼30-fold in the liver tissue of db/db obese/diabetic mice compared with their lean littermates, whereas treatment of db/db diabetic mice with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone partially reversed this change. We further confirmed this microarray data by using real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 1A). Tissue distribution analysis showed that MUP-1 was synthesized predominantly in the liver (supplemental Table 2). A much lower level of MUP-1 mRNA expression was also detected in heart, epididymal fat, and brown adipose tissue but not in several other tissues examined (skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, and spleen). The decreased MUP-1 mRNA expression in db/db mice was observed mainly in liver tissue. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of MUP-1 was altered upon changes in nutritional status. After overnight fasting, the mRNA level of MUP-1 was decreased by 50%, whereas its expression was markedly up-regulated by 1 h after refeeding (Fig. 1B). Circulating Concentrations of MUP-1 Are Markedly Reduced in db/db Diabetic/Obese Mice and High Fat Diet-induced Obese Mice—To investigate whether the changes in mRNA expression of MUP-1 in the liver tissue indeed leads to alterations in its circulating concentrations, we established a traditional ELISA to quantify serum MUP-1 in mice. To this end, we subcloned cDNA encoding the mature mouse MUP-1 (without signal peptide) into a prokaryotic expression vector and expressed this protein with a His6 tag at the NH2 terminus. SDS-PAGE analysis showed His6-tagged recombinant MUP-1 as a single band with a molecular mass of around 23 kDa (Fig. 2A). This recombinant protein was then used as the antigen for generation of polyclonal antibodies against MUP-1 in rabbits. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the antibody specifically recognized the recombinant MUP-1 as well as the endogenous MUP-1 in mouse serum as a single band (Fig. 2B). A sandwich ELISA was then constructed with this polyclonal antibody, and the assay standard curve generated with the recombinant MUP-1 yielded a consistent r value of >0.985 (Fig. 2C). The dynamic range of this assay was between 0.015 and 5 ng/ml. Consistent with the changes in MUP-1 mRNA abundance in the liver, serum levels of MUP-1 in male db/db diabetic mice were markedly reduced compared with the sex- and age-matched lean littermates (51.1 ± 8.8 versus 7.8 ± 2.3 μg/ml, n = 4–5, p = 0.00002) (Fig. 3A). Consistent with a previous report (14McIntosh I. Bishop J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we observed a striking sexual dimorphism in MUP-1 expression. Both the mRNA abundance (data not shown) and serum concentration of MUP-1 (Fig. 3A) in males was ∼7-fold higher than in females. In female mice a similar reduction of MUP-1 in db/db mice was also observed although to a lesser extent (7.2 ± 1.3 versus 1.4 ± 1.0 μg/ml, n = 10, p = 0.0004). To further confirm the pathological relevance of the above findings in db/db mice, we next examined the effects of high fat diet-induced obesity on MUP-1 production in mice. To this end, male C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a standard chow or a high fat diet for a period of 10 weeks. As expected, mice fed with the high fat diet developed obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance (data not shown). Compared with the standard chow group, MUP-1 protein levels in serum were significantly decreased in high fat diet-induced obese mice (50.3 ± 7.5 versus 19.8 ± 5.5 μg/ml, n = 4, p = 0.0004) (Fig. 3B). Replenishment of Recombinant MUP-1 Improves Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance in db/db Mice—The findings described above demonstrate that MUP-1 production is markedly decreased in both dietary obese mice and genetically inherited obese mice with frank diabetes. We next investigated whether supplementation of recombinant MUP-1 had any metabolic effects in these mice. Acute injection of recombinant MUP-1 did not cause any change in the fasting or fed glucose levels, lipid profiles, or serum insulin concentrations in db/db mice (data not shown). We therefore examined the chronic effects of recombinant MUP-1 in db/db mice. To this end, mice were surgically implanted with an Alzet osmotic pump, which delivered the recombinant MUP-1 (8 mg/kg of body weight/day) or physiological saline at a constant rate for a period of 2 weeks. Delivery of the recombinant MUP-1 at this dosage caused a ∼1.5–2.0-fold elevation of the circulating MUP-1 level throughout the 2-week treatment period (Fig. 4A). Chronic treatment of male db/db mice with recombinant MUP-1 had no obvious effect on food intake, body weight gains, or fasting blood glucose levels. On the other hand, it caused a significant decrease in the serum levels of triglycerides and insulin (Table 1). The fed glucose levels were also significantly decreased following treatment with recombinant MUP-1. Notably, db/db mice receiving MUP-1 treatment exhibited significantly improved glucose excursion after glucose load, which was particularly prominent at the late time points of an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (Fig. 4B). The glucose area under the curve in db/db mice treated with recombinant MUP-1 was smaller than those treated with saline control (Fig. 4C). The insulin tolerance test showed a modest, but significant, increase in insulin sensitivity following chronic treatment with recombinant MUP-1 for 10 days (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, a pyruvate tolerance test demonstrated that there was no obvious difference between the two groups in glucose production after pyruvate challenge (Fig. 4E). In female db/db mice, chronic treatment with recombinant MUP-1 also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity but had no effect on pyruvate-induced glucose production (data not shown).TABLE 1Metabolic parameters after chronic treatment with recombinant MUP-1 in db/db miceSaline controlan = 5.Recombinant MUP-1an = 5.Body weight (g)40.3 ± 2.739.1 ± 2.4Average daily food intake (g)6.1 ± 0.56.3 ± 0.7Serum insulin (ng/ml)11.5 ± 1.29.2 ± 0.8*Fasting glucose (mM)12.8 ± 1.311.9 ± 1.0Fed glucose (mM)23.7 ± 2.719.1 ± 2.1*Serum triglyceride (mg/dl)209.3 ± 13.7176.8 ± 12.4*a n = 5. Open table in a new tab Chronic Treatment with Recombinant MUP-1 Increases Energy Expenditure and Locomotor Activity in db/db Mice—To further evaluate the metabolic effects of MUP-1 supplementation in db/db mice, we housed the mice in metabolic cages in order to measure oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio (VCO2/VCO), and locomotor activity. Replenishment of recombinant MUP-1 significantly elevated energy expenditure in db/db mice (Fig. 5, A and B) and caused a modest but significant decrease in the respiratory quotient during the dark cycle (Fig. 5C), suggesting that MUP-1 might enhance lipid utilization. Furthermore, supplementation of recombinant MUP-1 also increased the locomotor activity and core body temperature, in particular during the dark cycle (Fig. 5, D and E). These findings suggest that MUP-1-mediated improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity may be attributed in part to an increased energy expenditure and locomotor activity. Recombinant MUP-1 Selectively Enhances Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Decreases Lipid Accumulation in Skeletal Muscle—To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the actions of MUP-1, we next examined its effects on key metabolic pathways in several major metabolically active tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. First, we investigated whether a MUP-1-mediated increase in energy expenditure and an improvement in glucose homeostasis were attributable to elevated mitochondrial uncoupling and heat dissipation in brown adipose tissue. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that replenishment of recombinant MUP-1 had no obvious effect on the expression of genes involved in either mitochondrial biogenesis or uncoupling, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), or on the mRNA abundance of a panel of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c, ATP synthase subunit 6, and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1). In contrast to those observations in adipose tissue, we found that replenishment of recombinant MUP-1 significantly increased the expre"

On the other hand, H3K36 methylation can also recruit the NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex through its PhD finger domain-containing subunit Nto1 (20.Martin D.G. Grimes D.E. Baetz K. Howe L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3018-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21.Shi X. Kachirskaia I. Walter K.L. Kuo J.H. Lake A. Davrazou F. Chan S.M. Martin D.G. Fingerman I.M. Briggs S.D.

The means by which H3K36me-mediated recruitment of histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase activities is balanced remains an interesting question. However, NuA3 interacts with the Set1 methyltransferase, and NuA3 function depends on both Set1 and its substrate H3K4 (20.Martin D.G. Grimes D.E. Baetz K. Howe L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3018-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, reduced levels of H3K36 methylation lead to subsequent reductions in H4K16 acetylation (23.Bell O. Wirbelauer C. Hild M. Scharf A.N. Schwaiger M. MacAlpine D.M.

In contrast, KMT3a (also known as HYPB or hSet2) is the mammalian orthologue of yeast KMT3, which shares high sequence similarity with yeast KMT3a at the Set domain, as well as at the WW and SRI domains. KMT3a specifically methylates H3K36 (27.Sun X.J. Wei J. Wu X.Y. Hu M. Wang L. Wang H.H. Zhang Q.H. Chen S.J. Huang Q.H. Chen Z. J. Biol.

Interestingly, unlike the yeast KMT3, knockdown of KMT3a results in the reduction of H3K36me3 exclusively, without affecting the other H3K36 methylation states (me1 and me2) in mammals (28.Edmunds J.W. Mahadevan L.C. Clayton A.L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) as well as in Drosophila (23.Bell O. Wirbelauer C. Hild M. Scharf A.N. Schwaiger M. MacAlpine D.M.

Here we report the purification of human KMT3a complex and the identification of a novel, higher eukaryotic specific subunit, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HnRNP-L). Interestingly, although KMT3a has intrinsic activity in vitro, RNAi against HnRNP-L leads to the reduction of H3K36me3 in vivo, without affecting KMT3a expression levels. HnRNP-L is a member of a large family of RRM domain-containing RNA-binding proteins.

Our finding that HnRNP-L plays a role in regulating chromatin modification suggests the existence of an elaborative cross-talk between the chromatin template and co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing. Antibodies against modified histones were purchased from Millipore. Antibody against H3 was kindly provided by Dr. Xingwang Deng, from the National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing. This antibody is a rabbit polyclonal generated with recombinant full-length H3 as immunogen, which recognize H3 regardless of its modification status. Antibody against HnRNP-L was a kind gift from Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dept. of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia. pFLAG-KMT3a-C and pFLAG-HnRNP-L were stably transfected into HEK293 cells to generate the FLAG-KMT3a-C and FLAG-HnRNP-L stable cell lines, respectively. Both plasmids were based on pCMV4-FLAG from Sigma, with a FLAG tag fused at the N terminus, under the control of CMV promoter. M2 anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) was equilibrated with the same buffer used in nuclear extract preparation (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with nuclear extract derived from the stable cell lines. The resin was washed with excess amounts of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m KCl, and proteins eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide. Anti-FLAG affinity-purified materials were further fractionated on a 2.4-ml Superose 6 gel filtration column at 4 °C, with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 m KCl. Gel-resolved proteins were digested with trypsin and fractionated, and resulting peptide pools were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI) reflectron time-of-flight (TOF) MS. Mass spectrometric sequencing of selected peptides was done by MALDI-TOF/TOF (MS/MS) analysis on the same prepared samples. Any identification thus obtained was verified by comparing the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptide with the experimental MS/MS data. 200 μg of nuclear extracts derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-KMT3a-C were incubated with excess amounts (100 μg) of RNaseA at 37 °C for 2 h. The extracts were then subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using antibody against HnRNP-L in parallel with its mock treated control extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation between KMT3a and HnRNP-L was performed under stringent conditions by washing with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m KCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40.

The reaction products were separated by 13% SDS-PAGE and then subjected to autoradiography. HeLa cells treated with HnRNP-L siRNA were analyzed 72 h after transfection. The sequences of chemically synthesized siRNA for HnRNP-L transient knockdown experiments were adopted from Hung et al. (32.Hung L.H. Heiner M. Hui J. Schreiner S. Benes V. Bindereif A.

The upper strand sequences were as follows: HnRNP-L, 1) 5′-GAAUGGAGUUCAGGCGAUGTT-3′; 2) 5′-CUACGAUGACCCGCACAAATT-3′; and Scrambled, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′. Lentivirus short hairpin RNA vectors for establishing stable RNAi cell lines for KMT3a were purchased from Sigma. Immunofluorescence were performed with HEK293 cells transiently transfected with siRNA against HnRNP-L (pair 1). Cells were stained 72 h after transfection.

Given our previous experiences with protein complexes in higher eukaryotes and their complexity in that they often differ from their yeast counterparts (36.Zhu B. Mandal S.S. Pham A.D. Zheng Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Batra S.K. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1668-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37.Zhu B. Zheng Y. Pham A.D. Mandal S.S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), we attempted to purify the human KMT3a complex to address its function in mammals. The closest homologue of yeast KMT3 in Homo sapiens is KMT3a, which has highly conserved domains and additional sequences of unknown function (Fig. 1A). Due to the failure of multiple attempts to stably express tagged full-length KMT3a in mammalian cells, we established an HEK293 stable cell line that expresses a FLAG-tagged version of the C-terminal half of KMT3a (FLAG-KMT3a-C, Fig. 1A). Nuclear extracts derived from this stable cell line were subjected to affinity purification using M2 anti-FLAG resin under stringent conditions (for details see “Experimental Procedures”), followed by Superose 6 gel filtration. Interestingly, FLAG-KMT3a-C co-eluted with a 60-kDa protein forming a complex with an apparent mass of ∼300 kDa. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis identified the co-eluting protein as HnRNP-L (Fig. 1B). HnRNP-L is an RNA-binding protein with three RNA recognition motifs, therefore it was possible that the apparent association between KMT3a and HnRNP-L was indirect, being mediated by their co-binding an RNA molecule. However, treatment of the nuclear extracts with excess amounts of RNaseA at 37 °C prior to affinity purification did not abolish the association between KMT3a and HnRNP-L (Fig. 1C), indicating the association is likely due to direct protein-protein interaction. To further scrutinize the above finding as well as to obtain a complex containing full-length KMT3a, we established a stable cell line expressing FLAG-tagged HnRNP-L. Reciprocal affinity purification with nuclear exacts from these cells indeed co-purified the endogenous full-length KMT3a (Fig. 1D), which was confirmed by Western blot (data not shown, see also Fig. 1E) and HKMT activity assays (see Fig. 3, A and B). We next performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cell nuclear extracts and antibodies against KMT3a and HnRNP-L to test for their interaction under endogenous conditions. Antibodies against KMT3a co-immunoprecipitated the endogenous HnRNP-L (Fig. 1E, lower panel). In a reciprocal experiment, antibodies against HnRNP-L co-immunoprecipitated the endogenous KMT3a (Fig. 1E, upper panel). In control experiments, antibody against HA was ineffectual (Fig. 1E). To map the regions of KMT3a responsible for its interaction with HnRNP-L, several GST-tagged KMT3a deletion mutants (Fig. 2A, left panel) were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (Fig. 2A, middle panel), then incubated with recombinant His-tagged HnRNP-L purified from E. coli, and subjected to the nickel-agarose pulldown assay. Silver staining of the eluates demonstrated that two regions of KMT3a could interact with HnRNP-L independently. One region encompasses the linker sequence between the WW domain and the SET domain, and another region consists of the SRI domain (Fig. 2A, right panel). Nickel-agarose alone did not pull down any of the deletion mutants in control experiments (data not shown). In addition, the KMT3a SET domain failed to interact with HnRNP-L (Fig. 2A, right panel). To map the domains on HnRNP-L responsible for its interaction with KMT3a, several His-tagged HnRNP-L deletion mutants (Fig. 2B, left panel) were expressed and purified from E. coli, then incubated with the recombinant GST-tagged KMT3a deletion mutants and subjected to the nickel-agarose pulldown assay. Silver staining of the eluates demonstrated that two regions of KMT3a could interact with HnRNP-L independently. The region containing the first RRM domain of HnRNP-L was sufficient to interact with the most C-terminal part of KMT3a (deletion K4) (Fig. 2B, bottom of right panel), whereas the region encompassing the second RRM domain could stabilize the interaction by binding to the KMT3a linker sequence between the SET and WW domains (Fig. 2B, top and middle of right panel). These studies collectively demonstrate the domains of each protein require for interaction, and further reinforce our purification studies. None of the interactions described above were sensitive to RNase treatment (data not shown). We then performed the histone methyltransferase assay using the human KMT3a complex purified from HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-HnRNP-L. The results showed it to be a nucleosomal specific HKMT, exhibiting barely detectable activity on core histones (Fig. 3A). In addition, its activity was specific for H3K36, because the K36A substitution mutant was completely defective as a substrate, while other K→A substitution mutants of histone H3 were successfully methylated (Fig. 3B). This result is consistent with that reported for the substrate specificity of the recombinant KMT3a SET domain (27.Sun X.J. Wei J. Wu X.Y. Hu M. Wang L. Wang H.H. Zhang Q.H. Chen S.J. Huang Q.H. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35261-35271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis of the products formed in the in vitro HKMT assay demonstrated that KMT3a is capable of methylating H3K36 to mono-, di-, and trimethylated status (Fig. 3C). This is in contrast to that observed in vivo. RNAi against KMT3a exclusively reduced the H3K36me3 mark in vivo, without affecting the mono- and dimethylated status either in mammals (supplemental Fig. S1) (28.Edmunds J.W. Mahadevan L.C. Clayton A.L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) or in Drosophila (23.Bell O. Wirbelauer C. Hild M. Scharf A.N. Schwaiger M. MacAlpine D.M. Zilbermann F. van Leeuwen F. Bell S.P. Imhof A. Garza D. Peters A.H. Schübeler D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4974-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To further understand the functional importance of the KMT3a complex in vivo, especially with regard to its newly identified HnRNP-L subunit, we investigated the levels of various histone modifications in cells after HnRNP-L knockdown. Two different siRNA pairs successfully achieved HnRNP-L knockdown in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Nuclear lysates were then analyzed by Western blot using various antibodies against histone proteins and specific histone modifications. In cells treated with either of the HnRNP-L siRNA pairs, we observed significantly lower H3K36me3 levels, but no apparent change in the levels of H3K36me1/2 or the other modifications tested (Fig. 4). To validate these results, we also performed immunofluorescence studies using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with siRNA targeting HnRNP-L and co-staining with antibodies against HnRNP-L and either histone H3 or modified histone H3. Fig. 5 demonstrates the essential role of HnRNP-L in maintaining H3K36me3 levels in vivo. Consistent with the Western results shown in Fig. 4, none of the other modifications tested, including H3K36me1/2, were affected. Because HnRNP-L knockdown had the same effect on histone H3K36 trimethylation as previously reported for KMT3a knockdown (supplemental Fig. S1) (28.Edmunds J.W. Mahadevan L.C. Clayton A.L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), we next examined if HnRNP-L could stimulate the HKMT activity of KMT3a biochemically. To address this, reconstitution experiments were performed using recombinant KMT3a-C and HnRNP-L, expressed from baculovirus independently or together. Co-expression of the two recombinant proteins displayed similar activity as KMT3a-C alone. In addition, titrating in recombinant HnRNP-L was ineffectual with respect to KMT3a-C activity (Fig. 6). Thus, HnRNP-L does not appear to up-regulate KMT3a activity under these conditions. Similar results were observed in the presence of synthetic RNA (data not shown). In this report, we presented the isolation, biochemical characterization, and functional analysis of the human KMT3a complex, which is composed of KMT3a and a higher eukaryotic specific subunit HnRNP-L. Although KMT3a has intrinsic activity in vitro (27.Sun X.J. Wei J. Wu X.Y. Hu M. Wang L. Wang H.H. Zhang Q.H. Chen S.J. Huang Q.H. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35261-35271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 6), HnRNP-L is required for its activity in vivo (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Moreover, KMT3a generates mono-, di-, and trimethylated products in vitro (Fig. 3C), but RNAi against KMT3a (supplemental Fig. S1) (23.Bell O. Wirbelauer C. Hild M. Scharf A.N. Schwaiger M.

Clayton A.L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) or HnRNP-L (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) down-regulates exclusively the H3K36me3 mark in vivo, suggesting other H3K36-specific HKMTs might be responsible for H3K36 mono- and dimethylation in vivo. Indeed our unpublished studies demonstrate that NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3 dimethylates H3K36.5 The exact mechanism by which HnRNP-L contributes to the HKMT activity of KMT3a is presently an open question. One possibility is that HnRNP-L plays a role in targeting the KMT3a complex to certain regions in chromatin. This is plausible given that HnRNP-L is an RNA-binding protein with certain sequence context preferences (29.Hui J. Stangl K. Lane W.S. Bindereif A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38.Liu X. Mertz J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1766-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is an intriguing possibility that selective binding toward certain RNA sequences could enrich the local concentration of the KMT3a complex at particular chromatin region(s), giving rise to hot spots of H3K36me3. Because HnRNP-L is a higher eukaryotic specific subunit of the KMT3a complex, such H3K36me3 hot spots are unlikely to exist in yeast. Additional high resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in higher eukaryotes might be necessary to prove or disprove the existence of such hot spots. Another intriguing possibility is that HnRNP-L may bind to the nascent RNA, thus directing KMT3a to establish the H3K36me3 mark on the template chromatin, which might in turn recruit factors involved in co-transcriptional RNA processing (see detailed discussions below). That higher eukaryotes express a subunit that specifically regulates HKMT trimethylase activity toward H3K36 begs the question of whether there are higher eukaryotic specific functions of H3K36me3 yet to be appreciated. Because HnRNP-L is an RNA-binding protein involved in multiple pre-mRNA processing events (29.Hui J. Stangl K. Lane W.S. Bindereif A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30.Rothrock C.R. House A.E. Lynch K.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31.Melton A.A.

RNA. 2008; 14: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33.Guang S. Felthauser A.M. Mertz J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6303-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), if there are higher eukaryotic specific functions of H3K36me3, they are likely linked to co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing such as splicing (or alternative splicing) and polyadenylation. Splicing is largely a higher eukaryotic specific event, because most yeast genes do not have intron(s). In contrast, human exons are often dispersed and spaced apart by huge introns. Although multiple mechanisms (for reviews, see Refs. 39.Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar, 40.Konarska M.M. Query C.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2255-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) exist for correctly selecting these small exons out of the bulky introns, it is certainly possible that other regulatory mechanisms are involved. One attractive hypothesis is that the chromatin templates of exons in most, or alternatively spliced genes are marked by specific histone modification(s) that recruit the splicing machinery thereby elevating its local concentration to the sites of the splicing substrates. Of note, H3K4me3, a mark for the start site of transcription, could recruit CHD1 that in turn recruits U2 and stimulates the rate of splicing in vivo (41.Sims 3rd, R.J. Millhouse S. Chen C.F. Lewis B.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Manley J.L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, as of now, chromatin modification(s) specifically marking the exons or exon-intron junctions have not been reported. Yet H3K36me3 would be a good candidate in this scenario as HnRNP-L is a factor involved in alternative splicing (29.Hui J. Stangl K. Lane W.S. Bindereif A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30.Rothrock C.R. House A.E. Lynch K.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31.Melton A.A. Jackson J. Wang J. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 6972-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32.Hung L.H. Heiner M. Hui J. Schreiner S. Benes V. Bindereif A. RNA. 2008; 14: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and, as shown here, is also a subunit of a chromatin-modifying enzyme complex essential for its activity. In support of this hypothesis that the splicing machinery could recognize the H3K36me3 mark, a recent report demonstrated that H3K36me3 is specifically enriched at the intron-exon boundaries (42.Kolasinska-Zwierz P. Down T. Latorre I. Liu T. Liu X.S. Ahringer J. Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Another post-transcriptional process to be considered is polyadenylation. Polyadenylation sites consist of a highly conserved sequence motif AAUAAA on the pre-mRNA (43.Fiddes J.C. Goodman H.M. Nature. 1980; 286: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 44.Fitzgerald M. Shenk T. Cell. 1981; 24: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Such a sequence could occur once every 4096 bp by chance. Although this is unlikely to be an issue in the case of yeast, it could pose a huge challenge to the integrity of polyadenylation in mammals that often produce pre-mRNA products of over 200 kb, each potentially containing over 50 such AAUAAA motifs. Thus higher eukaryotes might require additional mechanisms to ensure correct transcription termination and polyadenylation. This might entail that a gene, encoding a nascent mRNA that has been successfully cleaved by the polyadenylation machinery, would be marked with certain histone modification(s) to facilitate transcription termination. Of note, a histone modification (H3K4me3) marking the transcription start site (45.Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 46.Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) has been reported to recruit RNA polymerase II general transcription factor D (TFIID) (47.Vermeulen M. Mulder K.W. Denissov S. Pijnappel W.W. van Schaik F.M. Varier R.A. Baltissen M.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Mann M. Timmers H.T. Cell. 2007; 131: 58-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In this case, productive transcription sets the mark at the initiation site, which in turn stabilizes the recruited transcription machinery, safeguarding the proper initiation of subsequent transcription. H3K36me3 serves as an interesting candidate to mark the termination site not only because it has a higher eukaryotic-specific regulator, but also its levels tend to peak at the 3′-end of genes (22.Bannister A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2060445820,"Th17 cells are implicated in host defence and autoimmune diseases. CD28/B7 co-stimulation is involved in the induction and progression of autoimmune diseases, but its role in controlling murine Th17 cell fate remains to be clarified. We here report that soluble anti-CD28 mAb suppressed the differentiation of anti-CD3-stimulated naïve CD4+ T cells into IL-17-producing cells. CD28 co-stimulation reduced the frequency of proliferating cells that produce IL-17. We provide evidence for an IL-2 and IFN-γ-dependent mechanism of CD28-mediated IL-17 suppression. CD28 blockade of Th17 development was correlated with a decrease rather than an increase in the percentage of Foxp3+ T cells. In APC/T cell co-cultures, mature dendritic cells (DC) were less efficient than immature DC in their ability to support Th17 cell differentiation, while CTLA4-Ig, an agent blocking CD28/B7 and CTLA4/B7 interactions, facilitated both murine and human Th17 differentiation. This study identifies the importance of B7 co-stimulatory molecules in the negative regulation of Th17 development. These unexpected results caution targeting the CD28/B7 pathways in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2013722663,"High expression of Aurora-B has been observed in various cancers, and inhibition of this kinase has been shown to halt cellular proliferation. However, the mechanism of effect of Aurora-B on cellular transformation has not been fully explored. Here, we show that overexpression of Aurora-B in murine epithelial cells promotes generation of tetraploids. In search of a related mechanism, spectral karyotyping was carried out, showing premature chromatid separation (PCS). Of interest, PCS is a hallmark of Robert's syndrome, which also involves cellular polyploidy and aneuploidy. Sorted tetraploid Aurora-B-overexpressing cells promoted significant mammary epithelial cancers when injected into nude mice, as compared to injection of nonfractionated cells, suggesting that tetraploidy is an important mediator of Aurora-B-induced tumorigenesis. Comparative chromosome hybridization performed on DNA derived from tetraploid cell-induced tumors indicates amplifications and deletions of regions throughout the genome, which include tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing genes, respectively. Thus, sustained expression of Aurora-B induces tetraploidy, which, in turn, facilitates genomic instability and tumor development in a xenograft model."
https://openalex.org/W1973067181,"The cAMP signaling pathway plays an essential role in modulating the apoptotic response to various stress stimuli. Until now, it was attributed exclusively to the activity of the G-protein-responsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclase. In addition to transmembrane AC, mammalian cells possess a second source of cAMP, the ubiquitously expressed soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). However, the role of this cyclase in apoptosis was unknown. A mitochondrial localization of this cyclase has recently been demonstrated, which led us to the hypothesis that sAC may play a role in apoptosis through modulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. To prove this hypothesis, apoptosis was induced by simulated in vitro ischemia or by acidosis, which is an important component of ischemia. Suppression of sAC activity with the selective inhibitor KH7 or sAC knockdown by small interfering RNA transfection abolished endothelial apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of protein kinase A, an important cAMP target, demonstrated a significant anti-apoptotic effect. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed (i) the translocation of sAC to mitochondria under acidic stress and (ii) activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, i.e. cytochrome c release and caspase-9 cleavage. sAC inhibition or knockdown abolished the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Analysis of mitochondrial co-localization of Bcl-2 family proteins demonstrated sAC- and protein kinase A-dependent translocation of Bax to mitochondria. Taken together, these results suggest the important role of sAC in modulating the mitochondria-dependent pathway of apoptosis in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079330089,"Background We investigated if new vessel formation in fat involves the contribution of local tissue-derived endothelial cells (i.e., angiogenesis) or bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs, i.e. vasculogenesis) and if antiangiogenic treatment by blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors can prevent diet-induced obesity (DIO). Methodology/Principal Findings We performed restorative bone marrow transplantation into wild-type mice using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) constitutively (driven by β-actin promoter) or selectively in endothelial cells (under Tie2 promoter activation) as donors. The presence of donor BMDCs in recipient mice was investigated in fat tissue vessels after DIO using in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence microscopy. We investigated the roles of VEGF receptors 1 and 2 (VEGFR1/VEGFR2) by inducing DIO in mice and treating them with blocking monoclonal antibodies. We found only marginal (less than 1%) incorporation of BMDCs in fat vessels during DIO. When angiogenesis was inhibited by blocking VEGFR2 in mice with DIO, treated mice had significantly lower body weights than control animals. In contrast, blocking VEGFR1 had no discernable effect on the weight gain during DIO. Conclusions/Significance Formation of new vessels in fat tissues during DIO is largely due to angiogenesis rather than de novo vasculogenesis. Antiangiogenic treatment by blockade of VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1 may limit adipose tissue expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2071974978,"We have previously shown that the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor can best be described by a model that involves negative cooperativity in an aggregating system (Macdonald, J. L., and Pike, L. J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105, 112-117). However, despite the fact that biochemical analyses indicate that EGF induces dimerization of its receptor, the binding data provided no evidence for positive linkage between EGF binding and dimer assembly. By analyzing the binding of EGF to a number of receptor mutants, we now report that in naive, unphosphorylated EGF receptors, ligand binding is positively linked to receptor dimerization but the linkage is abolished upon autophosphorylation of the receptor. Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated EGF receptors exhibit negative cooperativity, indicating that mechanistically, cooperativity is distinct from the phenomenon of linkage. Nonetheless, both the positive linkage and the negative cooperativity observed in EGF binding require the presence of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain. This indicates the existence of inside-out signaling in the EGF receptor system. The intracellular juxtamembrane domain has previously been shown to be required for the activation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (Thiel, K. W., and Carpenter, G. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 19238-19243). Our experiments expand the role of this domain to include the allosteric control of ligand binding by the extracellular domain."
https://openalex.org/W2106716517,"Previous reports have shown that various steps in the influenza A virus life cycle are impaired in cells expressing the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> cells). We demonstrated a direct link between Bcl-2 and the reduced nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes in these cells. However, despite its negative impact on viral replication, Bcl-2 did not prevent host cells from undergoing virally triggered apoptosis. The protein's reduced antiapoptotic capacity was related to phosphorylation of its threonine 56 and serine 87 residues by virally activated p38MAPK. In infected Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> cells, activated p38MAPK was found predominantly in the cytoplasm, colocalized with Bcl-2, and both Bcl-2 phosphorylation and virally induced apoptosis were diminished by specific inhibition of p38MAPK activity. In contrast, in Bcl-2-negative (Bcl-2<sup>−</sup>) cells, which are fully permissive to viral infection, p38MAPK activity was predominantly nuclear, and its inhibition decreased vRNP traffic, phosphorylation of viral nucleoprotein, and virus titers in cell supernatants, suggesting that this kinase also contributes to the regulation of vRNP export and viral replication. This could explain why in Bcl-2<sup>+</sup> cells, where p38MAPK is active in the cytoplasm, phosphorylating Bcl-2, influenza viral replication is substantially reduced, whereas apoptosis proceeds at rates similar to those observed in Bcl-2<sup>−</sup> cells. Our findings suggest that the impact of p38MAPK on the influenza virus life cycle and the apoptotic response of host cells to infection depends on whether or not the cells express Bcl-2, highlighting the possibility that the pathological effects of the virus are partly determined by the cell type it targets."

https://openalex.org/W1974979789,"Influenza vaccines are reviewed each year, and often changed, in an effort to maintain their effectiveness against drifted influenza viruses. There is however no regular review of influenza vaccine effectiveness during, or at the end of, Australian influenza seasons. It is possible to use a case control method to estimate vaccine effectiveness from surveillance data when all patients in a surveillance system are tested for influenza and their vaccination status is known.Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is conducted during the influenza season in sentinel general practices scattered throughout Victoria, Australia. Over five seasons 2003-7, data on age, sex and vaccination status were collected and nose and throat swabs were offered to patients presenting within three days of the onset of their symptoms. Swabs were tested using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Those positive for influenza were sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza where influenza virus culture and strain identification was attempted. We used a retrospective case control design in five consecutive influenza seasons, and estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for patients of all ages to be 53% (95% CI 38-64), but 41% (95% CI 19-57) adjusted for age group and year. The adjusted VE for all adults aged at least 20 years, the age groups for whom a benefit of vaccination could be shown, was 51% (95% CI 34-63). Comparison of VE estimates with vaccine and circulating strain matches across the years did not reveal any significant differences.These estimates support other field studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness, given that theoretical considerations suggest that these values may underestimate true effectiveness, depending on test specificity and the ratio of the influenza ILI attack rate to the non-influenza ILI attack rate. Incomplete recording of vaccination status and under-representation of children in patients from whom a swab was collected limit the data. Improvements have been implemented for prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W2053592784,"Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is secreted by epithelial cells in all the mucosal fluids such as saliva, cervical mucus, as well in the seminal liquid. At the physiological concentrations found in saliva, SLPI has a specific antiviral activity against HIV-1 that is related to the perturbation of the virus entry process at a stage posterior to the interaction of the viral surface glycoprotein with the CD4 receptor. Here, we confirm that recombinant SLPI is able to inhibit HIV-1 infection of primary T lymphocytes, and show that SLPI can also inhibit the transfer of HIV-1 virions from primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells to autologous T lymphocytes. At the molecular level, we show that SLPI is a ligand for the phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) and PLSCR4, membrane proteins that are involved in the regulation of the movements of phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we reveal that PLSCR1 and PLSCR4 also interact directly with the CD4 receptor at the cell surface of T lymphocytes. We find that the same region of the cytoplasmic domain of PLSCR1 is involved in the binding to CD4 and SLPI. Since SLPI was able to disrupt the association between PLSCR1 and CD4, our data suggest that SLPI inhibits HIV-1 infection by modulating the interaction of the CD4 receptor with PLSCRs. These interactions may constitute new targets for antiviral intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2085715185,"IGF activity is regulated tightly by a family of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBP-5 is the most conserved of these and is up-regulated significantly during differentiation of several key lineages and in some cancers. The function of IGFBP-5 in these physiological and pathological situations is unclear, however, several IGFBP-5 sequence motifs and studies in vitro suggest IGF-independent actions. Therefore, we aimed to compare the phenotypes of mice overexpressing wild-type Igfbp5 or an N-terminal mutant Igfbp5 with negligible IGF binding affinity. Both significantly inhibited growth, even at low expression levels. Even though wild-type IGFBP-5 severely disrupted the IGF axis, we found no evidence for interaction of mutant IGFBP-5 with the IGF system. Further, overexpression of wild-type IGFBP-5 rescued the lethal phenotype induced by ""excess"" IGF-II in type 2 receptor-null mice; mutant IGFBP-5 overexpression could not. Therefore, wild-type IGFBP-5 provides a very effective mechanism for the inhibition of IGF activity and a powerful in vivo mechanism to inhibit IGF activity in pathologies such as cancer. This study is also the first to suggest significant IGF-independent actions for IGFBP-5 during development."
https://openalex.org/W1968743698,"These studies explore the connections between simvastatin, Rac1, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways in cultured vascular endothelial cells and in arterial preparations isolated from statin-treated mice. In addition to their prominent effects on lipoprotein metabolism, statins can regulate the small GTPase Rac1, and may also affect the phosphorylation of the ubiquitous AMPK. We explored pathways of statin-modulated Rac1 and AMPK activation both in arterial preparations from statin-treated mice as well as in cultured endothelial cells. We treated adult mice with simvastatin daily for 2 weeks and then harvested and analyzed arterial preparations. Simvastatin treatment of mice led to a significant increase in AMPK and LKB1 phosphorylation and to a decrease in protein kinase A activity relative to control animals, associated with a marked increase in Rac1 activation. Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells to simvastatin for 24 h strikingly increased GTP-bound Rac1 and led to increased phosphorylation of AMPK as well as the AMPK kinase LKB1. These responses to simvastatin were blocked by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of AMPK abrogated simvastatin-induced Rac1 activation and LKB1 phosphorylation. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the key AMPK kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta, completely blocked simvastatin-induced endothelial cell migration and also abrogated statin-promoted phosphorylation of AMPK and LKB1, as did pharmacological inhibition with the specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase beta inhibitor STO-609. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rac1 completely blocked simvastatin-induced LKB1 phosphorylation, but without affecting simvastatin-induced AMPK phosphorylation. These findings establish a key role for simvastatin in activation of a novel Rac1-dependent signaling pathway in the vascular wall."
https://openalex.org/W2010683995,"HSEPI (glucuronyl C5-epimerase) catalyzes the conversion of d-glucuronic acid to l-iduronic acid in heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis. Disruption of the Hsepi gene in mice yielded a lethal phenotype with selective organ defects but had remarkably little effect on other organ systems. We have approached the underlying mechanisms by examining the course and effects of FGF2 signaling in a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line derived from the Hsepi(-)(/)(-) mouse. The HS produced by these cells is devoid of l-iduronic acid residues but shows up-regulated N- and 6-O-sulfation compared with wild type (WT) MEF HS. In medium fortified with 10% fetal calf serum, the Hsepi(-)(/)(-) MEFs proliferated and migrated similarly to WT cells. Under starvation conditions, both cell types showed attenuated proliferation and migration that could be restored by the addition of FGF2 to WT cells, whereas Hsepi(-)(/)(-) cells were resistant. Moreover, ERK phosphorylation following FGF2 stimulation was delayed in Hsepi(-)(/)(-) compared with WT cells. Assessment of HS-growth factor interaction by nitrocellulose filter trapping revealed a strikingly aberrant binding property of FGF2 and glia-derived neurotropic factor to Hsepi(-)(/)(-) but not to WT HS. glia-derived neurotropic factor has a key role in kidney development, defective in Hsepi(-)(/)(-) mice. By contrast, Hsepi(-)(/)(-) and WT HS interacted similarly and in conventional mode with FGF10. These findings correlate defective function of growth factors with their mode of HS interaction and may help explain the partly modest organ phenotypes observed after genetic ablation of selected enzymes in HS biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2117841889,"Background HSP70 plays crucial roles in endothelial cell apoptosis, which is involved in the early phase and progress of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the association between polymorphisms of HSP70 genes and the risk of CHD still remains unclear. Our aim was to determine whether genetic variants in the HSPA1A gene are associated with the risk of CHD. Methodology/Principal Findings By resequencing and genotyping, the associations of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) +190G/C (rs1043618) and −110A/C (rs1008438) in the HSPA1A gene with risk of CHD were determined in a 1,003 pairs case-control study. The SNP function was further analyzed using a luciferase reporter assay in two cell lines. The results indicated that +190CC genotype was associated with significantly higher risk of CHD when compared with +190GG genotype (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.10–2.20, P = 0.012), while association between −110A/C polymorphism and CHD was not statistically significant (P>0.05). However, the −110C/+190C haplotype had a significantly higher risk of CHD when compared with the −110A/+190G haplotype (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01–1.34, P = 0.031). Luciferase reporter assays showed that the +190C allele resulted in 14%∼45% reduction in luciferase expression in endothelial and non-endothelial cells when compared with the +190G allele. Conclusions/Significance The identified genetic variants in the HSPA1A gene combinatorially contribute towards the susceptibility to CHD likely by affecting the level of synthesis of HSP70. This study may provide useful markers for identification of subjects at risk for CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2000058843,"Background Creatine Kinases (CK) catalyze the reversible transfer of high-energy phosphate groups between ATP and phosphocreatine, thereby playing a storage and distribution role in cellular energetics. Brain-type CK (CK-B) deficiency is coupled to loss of function in neural cell circuits, altered bone-remodeling by osteoclasts and complement-mediated phagocytotic activity of macrophages, processes sharing dependency on actomyosin dynamics. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we provide evidence for direct coupling between CK-B and actomyosin activities in cortical microdomains of astrocytes and fibroblasts during spreading and migration. CK-B transiently accumulates in membrane ruffles and ablation of CK-B activity affects spreading and migration performance. Complementation experiments in CK-B-deficient fibroblasts, using new strategies to force protein relocalization from cytosol to cortical sites at membranes, confirmed the contribution of compartmentalized CK-B to cell morphogenetic dynamics. Conclusion/Significance Our results provide evidence that local cytoskeletal dynamics during cell motility is coupled to on-site availability of ATP generated by CK-B."
https://openalex.org/W1979745754,"Background Mammals have seven NAD-dependent protein deacetylases. These proteins, called sirtuins, are homologous to yeast Sir2, and are emerging as important regulators of lifespan and intermediary metabolism. Three mammalian sirtuins, SIRT3-5 are mitochondrial. Sirtuins are highly conserved between species, yet mouse SIRT3 was reported to be markedly shorter than its human counterpart and to lack the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal present in the human protein. Results We have isolated a novel mouse SIRT3 splice variant. This cDNA contains two translation initiation codons upstream of the originally reported start site. We show, using immunofluorescence and protein expression analysis that these longer variants are expressed and efficiently targeted to mitochondria, and that the processed forms of these longer variants are identical in size to the endogenous mouse SIRT3. We also show that the previously described form of SIRT3 is not mitochondrial. Conclusions Our observations point to a high level of conservation of SIRT3 as a mitochondrial protein in mice and human and indicate that several previous studies, which addressed mouse Sirt3 function, need to be re-evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2095024589,"FGF signaling has multiple roles in regulating processes in animal development, including the specification and patterning of the mesoderm. In addition, FGF signaling supports self renewal of human embryonic stem cells and is required for differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells into a number of lineages.Given the importance of FGF signaling in regulating development and stem cell behaviour, we aimed to identify the transcriptional targets of FGF signalling during early development in the vertebrate model Xenopus laevis. We analysed the effects on gene expression in embryos in which FGF signaling was inhibited by dominant negative FGF receptors. 67 genes positively regulated by FGF signaling and 16 genes negatively regulated by FGF signaling were identified. FGF target genes are expressed in distinct waves during the late blastula to early gastrula phase. Many of these genes are expressed in the early mesoderm and dorsal ectoderm. A widespread requirement for FGF in regulating genes expressed in the Spemann organizer is revealed. The FGF targets MKP1 and DUSP5 are shown to be negative regulators of FGF signaling in early Xenopus tissues. FoxD3 and Lin28, which are involved in regulating pluripotency in ES cells are shown to be down regulated when FGF signaling is blocked.We have undertaken a detailed analysis of FGF target genes which has generated a robust, well validated data set. We have found a widespread role for FGF signaling in regulating the expression of genes mediating the function of the Spemann organizer. In addition, we have found that the FGF targets MKP1 and DUSP5 are likely to contribute to the complex feedback loops involved in modulating responses to FGF signaling. We also find a link between FGF signaling and the expression of known regulators of pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W1972148647,"In mammals, a temporal disconnection between mRNA transcription and protein synthesis occurs during late steps of germ cell differentiation, in contrast to most somatic tissues where transcription and translation are closely linked. Indeed, during late stages of spermatogenesis, protein synthesis relies on the appropriate storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in transcriptionally silent spermatids. The factors and cellular compartments regulating mRNA storage and the timing of their translation are still poorly understood. The chromatoid body (CB), that shares components with the P. bodies found in somatic cells, has recently been proposed to be a site of mRNA processing. Here, we describe a new component of the CB, the RNA binding protein HuR, known in somatic cells to control the stability/translation of AU-rich containing mRNAs (ARE-mRNAs).Using a combination of cell imagery and sucrose gradient fractionation, we show that HuR localization is highly dynamic during spermatid differentiation. First, in early round spermatids, HuR colocalizes with the Mouse Vasa Homolog, MVH, a marker of the CB. As spermatids differentiate, HuR exits the CB and concomitantly associates with polysomes. Using computational analyses, we identified two testis ARE-containing mRNAs, Brd2 and GCNF that are bound by HuR and MVH. We show that these target ARE-mRNAs follow HuR trafficking, accumulating successively in the CB, where they are translationally silent, and in polysomes during spermatid differentiation.Our results reveal a temporal regulation of HuR trafficking together with its target mRNAs from the CB to polysomes as spermatids differentiate. They strongly suggest that through the transport of ARE-mRNAs from the CB to polysomes, HuR controls the appropriate timing of ARE-mRNA translation. HuR might represent a major post-transcriptional regulator, by promoting mRNA storage and then translation, during male germ cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2053113369,"The perception of brightness depends on spatial context: the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds it. A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the colour of a stimulus can also alter its brightness. Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated (i.e. purer in colour) appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same luminance. Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than equiluminant yellow and green stimuli. This non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and brightness, called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (HK) effect, was first described in the nineteenth century but has never been explained. Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this 'illusion' to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple Bayesian ideal observer model of the human visual ecology. We also use fMRI brain scans to identify the neural correlates of brightness without changing the spatial context of the stimulus, which has complicated the interpretation of related fMRI studies.Rather than modelling human vision directly, we use a Bayesian ideal observer to model human visual ecology. We show that the HK effect is a result of encoding the non-linear statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the past. We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone photoreceptors, which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to encoding the statistics of images. Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual cortex (V1), if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of colours (as opposed to their luminance) accords with activity in V1 as measured with fMRI.The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of stimuli, as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal responses. While the responses of the early visual system (receptors in this case) may represent specifically the statistics of images, post receptor responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and scenes. A corollary of this suggestion is that the visual cortex is adapted to relate the retinal image to behaviour given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal images: the visual cortex is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2006008546,"The polysialyltransferases ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV polysialylate the glycans of a small subset of mammalian proteins. Their most abundant substrate is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). An acidic surface patch and a novel alpha-helix in the first fibronectin type III repeat of NCAM are required for the polysialylation of N-glycans on the adjacent immunoglobulin domain. Inspection of ST8Sia IV sequences revealed two conserved polybasic regions that might interact with the NCAM acidic patch or the growing polysialic acid chain. One is the previously identified polysialyltransferase domain (Nakata, D., Zhang, L., and Troy, F. A. (2006) Glycoconj. J. 23, 423-436). The second is a 35-amino acid polybasic region that contains seven basic residues and is equidistant from the large sialyl motif in both polysialyltransferases. We replaced these basic residues to evaluate their role in enzyme autopolysialylation and NCAM-specific polysialylation. We found that replacement of Arg(276)/Arg(277) or Arg(265) in the polysialyltransferase domain of ST8Sia IV decreased both NCAM polysialylation and autopolysialylation in parallel, suggesting that these residues are important for catalytic activity. In contrast, replacing Arg(82)/Arg(93) in ST8Sia IV with alanine substantially decreased NCAM-specific polysialylation while only partially impacting autopolysialylation, suggesting that these residues may be particularly important for NCAM polysialylation. Two conserved negatively charged residues, Glu(92) and Asp(94), surround Arg(93). Replacement of these residues with alanine largely inactivated ST8Sia IV, whereas reversing these residues enhanced enzyme autopolysialylation but significantly reduced NCAM polysialylation. In sum, we have identified selected amino acids in this conserved polysialyltransferase polybasic region that are critical for the protein-specific polysialylation of NCAM."
https://openalex.org/W1965174782,"There is evidence that immune-activated macrophages infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are associated with tissue damage and serve as a long-lived viral reservoir during therapy. In this study, we analyzed 780 HIV genetic sequences generated from 53 tissues displaying normal and abnormal histopathology. We found up to 50% of the sequences from abnormal lymphoid and macrophage rich non-lymphoid tissues were intra-host viral recombinants. The presence of extensive recombination, especially in non-lymphoid tissues, implies that HIV-1 infected macrophages may significantly contribute to the generation of elusive viral genotypes in vivo. Because recombination has been implicated in immune evasion, the acquisition of drug-resistance mutations, and alterations of viral co-receptor usage, any attempt towards the successful eradication of HIV-1 requires therapeutic approaches targeting tissue macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2072561954,"Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is an atheromatous-like lesion that affects vessels of transplanted organs. It is a component of chronic rejection that conventional immuno-suppression fails to prevent, and is a major cause of graft loss. Indirect allo-recognition through T cells and allo-Abs are critical during CAV pathogenesis. We tested whether the indirect allo-response and its impact on CAV is down-regulated by in situ-delivery of donor Ags to recipient's dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid organs in a pro-tolerogenic fashion, through administration of donor splenocytes undergoing early apoptosis. Following systemic injection, donor apoptotic cells were internalized by splenic CD11c(hi) CD8alpha(+) and CD8(-) DCs, but not by CD11c(int) plasmacytoid DCs. Those DCs that phagocytosed apoptotic cells in vivo remained quiescent, resisted ex vivo-maturation, and presented allo-Ag for up to 3 days. Administration of donor apoptotic splenocytes, unlike cells alive, (i) promoted deletion, FoxP3 expression and IL-10 secretion, and decreased IFN-gamma-release in indirect pathway CD4 T cells; and (ii) reduced cross-priming of anti-donor CD8 T cells in vivo. Targeting recipient's DCs with donor apoptotic cells reduced significantly CAV in a fully-mismatched aortic allograft model. The effect was donor specific, dependent on the physical characteristics of the apoptotic cells, and was associated to down-regulation of the indirect type-1 T cell allo-response and secretion of allo-Abs, when compared to recipients treated with donor cells alive or necrotic. Down-regulation of indirect allo-recognition through in situ-delivery of donor-Ag to recipient's quiescent DCs constitutes a promising strategy to prevent/ameliorate indirect allorecognition and CAV."
https://openalex.org/W2085642655,"In laboratory mice and rats, congenic breeding is essential for analyzing the genes of interest on specific genetic backgrounds and for analyzing quantitative trait loci. However, in theory it takes about 3-4 years to achieve a strain carrying about 99% of the recipient genome at the tenth backcrossing (N10). Even with marker-assisted selection, the so-called 'speed congenic strategy', it takes more than a year at N4 or N5.Here we describe a new high-speed congenic system using round spermatids retrieved from immature males (22-25 days of age). We applied the technique to three genetically modified strains of mice: transgenic (TG), knockin (KI) and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutants. The donor mice had mixed genetic backgrounds of C57BL/6 (B6):DBA/2 or B6:129 strains. At each generation, males used for backcrossing were selected based on polymorphic marker analysis and their round spermatids were injected into B6 strain oocytes. Backcrossing was repeated until N4 or N5. For the TG and ENU-mutant strains, the N5 generation was achieved on days 188 and 190 and the proportion of B6-homozygous loci was 100% (74 markers) and 97.7% (172/176 markers), respectively. For the KI strain, N4 was achieved on day 151, all the 86 markers being B6-homozygous as early as on day 106 at N3. The carrier males at the final generation were all fertile and propagated the modified genes. Thus, three congenic strains were established through rapid generation turnover between 41 and 44 days.This new high-speed breeding strategy enables us to produce congenic strains within about half a year. It should provide the fastest protocol for precise definition of the phenotypic effects of genes of interest on desired genetic backgrounds."

At worst, d-aminoacylated tRNAs infiltrate the protein synthesis machinery. Although the latter harmful possibility has not yet been firmly established, several cells were shown to possess a d-tyrosyl-tRNA deacylase, or DTD, that should help them counteract the accumulation of d-aminoacyl-tRNAs. This enzyme shows a broad specificity, being able to remove various d-aminoacyl moieties from the 3′-end of a tRNA (4Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol.

Importing dtd2 into E. coli functionally compensates for dtd deprivation. As shown in Table 1, the DTD2 protein has homologs in most archaea and in plants (16Wydau S. Ferri-Fioni M.-L. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Several cells contain neither dtd nor dtd2 homologs (Table 1). For instance, 28 cyanobacterial genomes out of the 33 available ones lack any deacylase-like gene. We took Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 as a model and examined whether this cell contained deacylase activity. This led us to the discovery and characterization of a third type of d-tyrosyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD3). This protein, encoded by dtd3, behaves as a metalloenzyme. Sensitivity of the growth of Synechocystis to external d-tyrosine is strongly exacerbated by the disruption of dtd3. Moreover, expression of the Synechocystis DTD3 in a Δdtd E. coli strain, from a plasmid, restores the resistance of the bacterium to d-tyrosine. Finally, using the available genomes, we examined the occurrence of DTD3 in the living world. The prevalence of DTD3-like proteins is surprisingly high. It suggests that the defense of protein synthesis against d-amino acids is universal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. Synechocystis strains were cultivated under shaking at 30 °C with a photon flux density of 50 μmol·m–2·s–1 in BG11 medium (Sigma) modified by the addition of 10 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm Hepes (pH 8), 46 μm H3BO3, 9.1 μm MnCl2, 0.77 μm ZnSO4, 1.9 μm MoNa2O4, 0.32 μm CuSO4, and 0.33 μm Co(NO3)2. For growth on plates, 1.9% agar was added. E. coli strains were cultivated in 2× TY-rich medium or in M9-glucose minimal medium at 37 °C, with shaking.Preparation of Crude Extracts—d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in a fresh crude extract of Synechocystis strain PCC6803 was assayed using d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr as substrate. A culture of cyanobacteria (100 ml) was centrifuged at 9800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing or not 160 μm NiCl2. The same protocol was applied for comparison of the deacylase activity in extracts of strains PCC6803 and PCC6803ΔDTD3 except that 40 μm CoCl2 was added to the buffer instead of 160 μm NiCl2. Final volumes of the bacterial suspensions were adjusted to obtain an optical density (OD) of ∼100 at 750 nm. Cells were disrupted by sonication (3 min, 0 °C), and debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 21,400 × g, 4 °C).To obtain crude extracts of E. coli cells transformed with pET3alpa, pET3alpa::1786, or pET3alpa::0208, bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 50 ml of 2× TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the stationary phase of growth was reached, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; FA, formic acid; ORF, open reading frame; PDB, Protein Data Bank. was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was further incubated at 4 °C for 5 h with shaking. After centrifugation at 9800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, bacteria were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and disrupted following the same protocol as that used with the Synechocystis cells. Total amounts of proteins in all extracts were measured by using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as standard.Measurement of Deacylation Rates—d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr (500 Ci/mol), l-[14C]Tyr-tRNATyr (434 Ci/mol), and diacetyl-l-[14C]Lys-tRNALys (310 Ci/mol) were prepared from E. coli tRNAs as described previously (6Soutourina J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).To assay deacylase activity during the purification of the DTD3 protein from Synechocystis extracts, protein samples were diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 160 μm NiCl2 (TN buffer). This solution was further diluted 4-fold in a 100-μl assay. Finally, d-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolysis was followed for 5 min at 28 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 40 μm NiCl2 and 100 nm d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr. During the purification of DTD3 from recombinant E. coli cells, d-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolysis was followed as described above, except that NiCl2 was omitted from the assay mixture and from the enzyme dilution buffer.Unless otherwise stated, the activity of the purified DTD3 protein was measured under initial conditions for 5 min, at 28 °C, in 100-μl assays containing 100 nm substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mm MgCl2, and 40 μm CoCl2. Before use, the enzyme was diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 40 μm CoCl2.In all cases, the deacylation reaction was quenched by the addition of 340 μl of ethanol, 14 μl of sodium acetate 3 m (pH 4.8), and 20 μl of carrier RNA (4 mg/ml) from yeast (Roch-Light Ltd.). Samples were centrifuged (20 min, 21,400 × g, 4 °C), and the radioactivity in the supernatant was measured by scintillation counting (11Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One unit corresponds to the enzyme activity capable of hydrolyzing 1 pmol of d-Tyr-tRNATyr per min in the above conditions. For each rate measurement, two independent experiments were performed. Mean values are given with associated ranges.To measure the catalytic constants of purified deacylase in the reaction of d-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolysis, initial rates were followed as above, with cobalt, in miniaturized (20 μl) assays containing increasing concentrations of substrate (90–6000 nm) and a constant deacylase concentration of 165 pm. Km and kcat values with standard deviations were derived from iterative nonlinear fits of the theoretical Michaelis equation to the experimental values using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (17Dardel F. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 273-275PubMed Google Scholar).Purification of d-Aminoacyl-tRNA Deacylase from Synechocystis—The culture (18 liters) of Synechocystis was centrifuged (11,300 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet (∼18 g of wet weight) was resuspended in 180 ml of TN buffer containing 0.1 mm PMSF. Cells were disrupted by sonication (10 min, 0 °C), and the extract was centrifuged (9800 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of streptomycin (30 mg/ml) to the supernatant. Then the sample was centrifuged for 20 min at 9800 × g (4 °C). The supernatant was diluted to 400 ml and applied on a Q-Sepharose FastFlow column (GE Healthcare) of 450 ml equilibrated in TN buffer. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with a 6-liter linear gradient of 0–335 mm NaCl in the same buffer. d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity was recovered between 200 and 250 mm NaCl. Fractions containing activity were pooled (510 ml) and dialyzed twice against 5 liters of TN buffer. To concentrate the sample, the pooled fractions were applied on a 10-ml Q-Sepharose FastFlow column equilibrated in TN buffer. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–335 mm NaCl in the TN buffer. Active fractions were pooled (20 ml). The resulting sample was concentrated to a volume of ∼5 ml with an Amicon Ultra-4 filter (cut-off 10 kDa; Millipore) and loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (1.6 × 60 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in TN buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions with deacylase activity were pooled (11 ml), and the sample was concentrated to 1.5 ml with Amicon Ultra-4 filters. Ammonium sulfate was added to the resulting sample at a final concentration of 1.7 m. After centrifugation of the insoluble material (20 min, 21,400 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant was applied to a Bakerbond Wide-Pore Hi-propyl C3 (Baker) column equilibrated in TN buffer containing 3 m ammonium sulfate. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min with a 20-ml decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (from 3 to 0 m) in TN buffer. Fractions containing deacylase activity were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid and 0.01% Triton X-100 and submitted to SDS-PAGE.DNA Extraction—A culture of cyanobacteria (6 ml) was centrifuged (9200 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20% saccharose, 5 mm EDTA and 5 mg/ml lysozyme. After 45 min of incubation of the mixture at 37 °C, 40 μl of 10% SDS and 300 μl of a solution containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm EDTA were added. Then two phenol extractions were performed. To remove phenol, 600 μl of diethyl ether were added and vigorously mixed with the sample. After centrifugation (21,400 × g, 5 min, 20 °C), the aqueous phase was precipitated with 500 μl propan-2-ol and centrifuged once more. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 50 μl of 20 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied Science). After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the sample was stored at 4 °C.Cloning of the sll1786 and sll0208 Genes—The genomic DNA of strain PCC6803 was used as a template to amplify the sll1786 and sll0208 genes. The primers chosen for PCR amplification were sll1786_NdeI_for plus sll1786_NotI_rev for the insertion of sll1786 into the pET3alpa plasmid, sll1786_XbaI_for plus sll1786_NotI_rev for the insertion of sll1786 into pET15blpa, and sll0208_NdeI_for plus sll0208_NotI_rev for the insertion of sll0208 into pET3alpa (see supplemental Table 2 for the sequences of the primers). The resulting amplified fragments were purified by using the Qiagen PCR purification kit 50 and digested by either NdeI plus NotI or by XbaI plus NotI. The two digestion products were inserted into plasmids pET3alpa and pET15blpa to give plasmids pET3alpa::1786, pET15blpa::1786, and pET3alpa::0208. With each plasmid, the integrity of the cloned gene was verified by DNA sequencing.Purification of the sll1786 Gene Product—E. coli strain K37ΔRecAΔTyrHλDE3 (15Ferri-Fioni M.L. Fromant M. Bouin A.P. Aubard C. Lazennec C. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27575-27585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was transformed by plasmid pET3alpa::1786. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C until the stationary phase in 2 liters of 2× TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Then 1 mm of IPTG was added, and the culture was left to incubate for 5 h at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 9800 × g (4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 0.1 mm PMSF to obtain an OD of ∼100 at 650 nm. Cells were disrupted by sonication (10 min, 0 °C), and debris was removed by centrifugation (20,400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of streptomycin (30 mg/ml) to the supernatant, which was then centrifuged for 20 min at 20,400 × g (4 °C). The resulting supernatant was applied on a Q-Sepharose FastFlow column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 1-liter linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Enzyme activity was recovered between 200 and 250 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and directly applied on a hydroxylapatite column (1.1 × 2 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). This column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with 20 ml of a linear sodium phosphate buffer gradient (0–0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), in 20 mm Tris-HCl). Fractions with enzyme activity recovered between 250 and 275 mm phosphate were pooled. According to SDS-PAGE analysis, the purified protein was at least 90% homogeneous. The purification procedure yielded 30 mg of protein. Finally, the protein sample was concentrated to 15 ml with an Amicon Ultra-4 filter, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 60% glycerol, and stored at –20 °C.Disruption of the sll1786 Gene—The 800 bp downstream from the sll1786 ORF were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of Synechocystis as template and oligonucleotides Av_ SacII and Av_NotI as primers. The resulting fragment was digested by SacII plus NotI and introduced into the corresponding sites on pET3alpa to produce pET3alpa::Av. The insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The 800 bp upstream of sll1786 were amplified with the primers Am_NdeI and Am_ KpnI. The PCR product was digested by NdeI plus KpnI and cloned into the corresponding sites on pET3alpa::Av, thus creating pET3alpa::Am::Av. The integrity of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The kanamycin resistance sequence of pUC4K (18Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) was amplified with the primers Kan_KpnI and Kan_SacII. The resulting DNA fragment was digested by KpnI and SacII. Then the fragment was ligated with pET3alpa::Am::Av previously digested by the same enzymes to produce pET3alpa::Am::Kan::Av. After transformation of E. coli with the ligation mixture, the clones containing plasmid pET3alpa::Am::Kan::Av were selected on LB agar containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin.An exponentially growing Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 culture (40 ml, OD750 ∼0.2) was centrifuged (1400 × g, 20 °C). After resuspension in 5 ml of fresh medium, the cells were exposed to 50 μg of pET3alpa::Am::Kan::Av DNA. The transformation mixture was incubated for 6 h at 30 °C under light and shaking. 100 μl of the transformation mixture was then plated on a membrane filter (ME25, Whatman) and laid on a Petri dish containing modified BG11 agar medium. The dish was incubated at 30 °C during 60 h under light, and the membrane filter was shifted on modified BG11 agar plate supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. After 9 days of incubation at 30 °C with light, mutants were streaked on BG11 agar medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The replacement of sll1786 by the kanamycin resistance gene was verified by PCR using oligonucleotides kan-2 plus 30s_6 and 1786_1 plus 1786_5.Measurement of Generation Times—E. coli generation times were measured as described previously (16Wydau S. Ferri-Fioni M.-L. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To start the growth of cyanobacteria, Synechocystis strains PCC6803 and PCC6803ΔDTD3 were inoculated in 20 ml of the medium under study. The inoculates were such that an OD750 of 0.2 was reached. The OD of the culture was then measured every day for 7 days. Generation times with standard deviations were deduced from fits of these measurements to an exponential function (17Dardel F. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 273-275PubMed Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry-based protein identification was done with the standard protein mass fingerprint method. Briefly, gel bands were cut and subjected to reduction (10 mm dithiothreitol, 56 °C, 30 min) followed by alkylation (55 mm iodoacetamide, room temperature, 20 min) and digestion by trypsin (12.5 ng/μl, 37 °C, 2 h; Roche Applied Science). After extraction (1% formic acid (FA) in water, followed by 1% FA in acetonitrile), the resulting peptide mixture was lyophilized, dissolved in 1% FA water, and desalted with a C18 micropipette tip (Agilent) using 50/50/1 water/acetonitrile/FA as the elution solvent. The masses of the peptides were then measured on a Q-TOF Premier (Waters) mass spectrometer. The mass list was submitted to a data base search using the Mascot search engine against the NCBInr data base. The search took into account two possible missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation of cysteines and optional oxidation of methionines.To measure the mass of the native protein, the protein-metal cations complexes were desalted using Micro-BioSpin 6 chromatography columns (BioSpin). First, a concentrated stock of ammonium acetate (1 m) was chromatographed through a Chelex 100 column (0.2 × 7 cm; Bio-Rad) to remove contaminating metal ions. The recovered buffer was diluted 100-fold with purified water. This solution was used to equilibrate BioSpin columns, as indicated by the manufacturer for buffer exchange (four equilibrations with 500 μl of 10 mm ammonium acetate). Then 70 μl of the initial protein solution were loaded onto a first chromatography column and eluted by centrifugation (2 min, 1000 × g). This step was repeated on a new chromatography column. When necessary, denaturation of the protein to remove noncovalently bound metal ions was done by adding to the protein solution an equal volume of 4% FA in acetonitrile. The solutions were analyzed on two mass spectrometers. A Q-TOF Premier (Waters) mass spectrometer was used for the quantitation of the number of metal ions present on the protein (19van den Bremer E.T. Jiskoot W. James R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Heck A.J. Maier C.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1738-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mass spectra were recorded without any selection in the first quadrupole, without collision energy and with a mass range of m/z 1000–4000. An FT-ICR Apex III (Bruker) mass spectrometer equipped with a 7.0-tesla actively shielded magnet was used for high resolution experiments to identify the metal ions bound to the protein. The spectra were recorded with a mass range of m/z 1000–6000. For both instruments, the solution was loaded in a nano-electrospray needle and set in the source of the mass spectrometer. Source temperature and voltages were adjusted to minimize complex dissociation.Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy—Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Varian AA220 spectrophotometer equipped with an air-acetylene burner. Zinc and cobalt contents were measured in the peak mode, with 100-μl injections at 213.9 and 240.7 nm, respectively. Metal concentrations were deduced from two independent experiments in which each measurement was made in triplicate. Mean values are given with associated ranges. When enzyme was dialyzed prior to atomic absorption measurements, the dialysis buffer was deprived of contaminating divalent cations as described above for the preparation of the ammonium acetate solution.RESULTSPurification of d-Tyr-tRNATyr Deacylase Activity from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 Crude Extracts—Strain Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was cultured in modified BG11 medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells were harvested after 1 week of growth, and isolation of the enzyme supporting the deacylase activity was attempted at 4 °C.We observed that purification of the protein could not be achieved because of spontaneous loss of the activity in the cell extract. To possibly protect deacylase activity, several compounds were added to the extract, including metals, EDTA, and reducing agents. The addition of Ni2+, Mn2+ or Co2+, but not Zn2+ protected the activity enough to trace the enzyme over weeks. As will be discussed below, this behavior reflects an interference of transition metal ions with the activity of the deacylase. Eventually, with the presence of NiCl2 in all purification buffers and in the activity assay, isolation of a deacylase sample could be carried out within 3 weeks, as follows.d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in a fresh crude extract was assayed using d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr as substrate. Deacylation of the d-aminoacyl-tRNA occurred at a rate of 240 units per mg of protein (28 °C, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 40 μm NiCl2). At the end of the deacylation reaction, it was verified that the tRNA could still be fully aminoacylated in the presence of E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and l-[14C]tyrosine.To isolate further this activity, a crude extract was prepared from an 18-liter culture. Nucleic acids were precipitated by streptomycin. After chromatographies on two successive Q-Sepharose columns, one Superdex 75 and one Hi-propyl column, the specific deacylase activity was enriched by nearly 150-fold, compared with the crude extract. Active fractions recovered from the last column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Several protein bands were visible. The intensities of two of them, with migrations around 30 kDa, varied proportionally with the deacylase activity along the elution profile of the column. The corresponding proteins were recovered from the gel and submitted to tryptic digestion. Mass spectrometry analysis of the resulting peptides identified the sll0208 and sll1786 ORFs from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 as the sources of the two proteins.The two ORFs were amplified by PCR and inserted into the expression vector pET3alpa. E. coli strain K37ΔRecAΔTyrHλDE3 (Δdtd) was transformed with the resulting plasmids (pET3alpa::0208 or pET3alpa::1786). Upon induction with IPTG, each strain overexpressed a soluble protein having the expected mass of ∼30 kDa. d-Tyrosyl-tRNATyr deacylase activity was assayed in crude extracts, in the presence of 40 μm NiCl2. In the crude extract of K37ΔRecAΔTyrHλDE3 containing pET3alpa:1786, the specific deacylase activity (28 °C, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)) was at least 1500-fold higher (138,000 units/mg protein) than those measured using the strains transformed by either pET3alpa:0208 or the control plasmid pET3alpa (<90 units/mg). Thus, we concluded that the sll1786 ORF, not the sll0208 one, accounted for d-tyrosyl-tRNA deacylase activity in the cyanobacterium. The product of this gene, with a theoretical molecular mass of 29,258 Da, was named DTD3.Effect of Metal Ions on the Activity of DTD3—The DTD3 protein was purified from E. coli cells K37ΔRecAΔTyrHλDE3 harboring pET3alpa::1786. Contrary to the purification of the protein from the Synechocystis extract, we did not need to add a metal to the E. coli extract to pursue the purification procedure. The main reason is that purification from the E. coli extract required a much shorter time (3 days) than that necessary"
https://openalex.org/W2049314525,"Myotube apoptosis occurs normally during muscle development and aging but it can lead to destruction of skeletal muscle in neuromuscular diseases. Therefore, understanding how myotube apoptosis is regulated is important for developing novel strategies for treatment of muscle loss. We investigated the regulation of apoptosis in skeletal muscle and report a striking increase in resistance to apoptosis following differentiation. We find mitotic C2C12 cells (myoblast-like cells) are sensitive to cytosolic cytochrome c microinjection. However, differentiated C2C12 cells (myotube-like cells) and primary myotubes are markedly resistant. This resistance is due to endogenous X-linked inhibitor of apoptotic protein (XIAP). Importantly, the selective difference in the ability of XIAP to block myotube but not myoblast apoptosis is not due to a change in XIAP but rather a decrease in Apaf-1 expression. This decrease in Apaf-1 links XIAP to caspase activation and death. Our findings suggest that in order for myotubes to die, they may degrade XIAP, functionally inactivate XIAP or upregulate Apaf-1. Importantly, we identify a role for endogenous Smac in overcoming XIAP to allow myotube death. However, in postmitotic cardiomyocytes, where XIAP also restricts apoptosis, endogenous Smac was not capable of overcoming XIAP to cause death. These results show that as skeletal muscle differentiate, they become resistant to apoptosis because of the ability of XIAP to regulate caspase activation. The increased restriction of apoptosis in myotubes is presumably important to ensure the long term survival of these postmitotic cells as they play a vital role in the physiology of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2133609727,"Volatile anesthetics (VAs)’ such as isoflurane’ induce a general anesthetic state by binding to specific targets (i.e.’ ion channels) in the central nervous system (CNS). Simultaneously’ VAs modulate immune functions’ possibly via direct interaction with alternative targets on leukocytes. One such target’ the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)’ has been shown previously to be inhibited by isoflurane. A better understanding of the mechanism by which isoflurane alters protein function requires the detailed information about the drug-protein interaction at an atomic level. Here’ we describe the crystal structure of the LFA-1 ligand-binding domain (I domain) in complex with isoflurane at 1.6 A. We discovered that isoflurane binds to an allosteric cavity previously implicated as critical for the transition of LFA-1 from the low- to the high-affinity state. The isoflurane binding site in the I domain involves an array of amphiphilic interactions’ thereby resembling a “common anesthetic binding motif” previously predicted for authentic VA binding sites. These results suggest that the allosteric modulation of protein function by isoflurane’ as demonstrated for the integrin LFA-1’ might represent a unified mechanism shared by the interactions of volatile anesthetics with targets in the CNS.— Zhang, H., Astrof, N. S., Liu, J.-H., Wang, J.-H., Shimaoka, M. Crystal structure of isoflurane bound to integrin LFA-1 supports a unified mechanism of volatile anesthetic action in the immune and central nervous systems.

https://openalex.org/W2146307538,"Increased expression of the astrocytic intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a characteristic of astrogliosis. This process occurs in the brain during aging and neurodegeneration and coincides with impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Inhibition of the proteasome impairs protein degradation; therefore, we hypothesized that the increase in GFAP may be the result of impaired proteasomal activity in astrocytes. We investigated the effect of proteasome inhibitors on GFAP expression and other intermediate filament proteins in human astrocytoma cells and in a rat brain model for astrogliosis. Extensive quantitative RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and Western blot analysis resulted unexpectedly in a strong decrease of GFAP mRNA to <4% of control levels [Control (DMSO) 100+/-19.2%; proteasome inhibitor (epoxomicin) 3.5+/-1.3%, n=8; P < or = 0.001] and a loss of GFAP protein in astrocytes in vitro. We show that the proteasome alters GFAP promoter activity, possibly mediated by transcription factors as demonstrated by a GFAP promoter-luciferase assay and RT(2) Profiler PCR array for human transcription factors. Most important, we demonstrate that proteasome inhibitors also reduce GFAP and vimentin expression in a rat model for induced astrogliosis in vivo. Therefore, proteasome inhibitors could serve as a potential therapy to modulate astrogliosis associated with CNS injuries and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1984333278,"Osteoblasts are the primary cells responsible for bone formation. They also support osteoclast formation from bone marrow precursors in response to osteotropic factors by inducing receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) expression and down-regulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) production. In addition to the RANKL-RANK-OPG signaling axis, other factors produced by osteoblasts/stromal cells are involved in osteoclastogenesis. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of leucine-rich repeat-containing 17 (LRRc17), a member of the LRR superfamily that acts as a negative regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Osteoblasts showed high levels of LRRc17 expression, which was down-regulated in response to the pro-osteoclastogenic factor 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). Recombinant LRRc17 protein inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from bone marrow precursors, whereas it did not affect the differentiation or activation of macrophages and dendritic cells. These results suggest that among the cell types derived from common myeloid precursors, LRRc17 specifically regulates osteoclasts. Further analysis revealed that LRRc17 attenuated RANKL-induced expression of NFATc1 by blocking phospholipase C-gamma signaling, which, in turn, inhibited RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our results demonstrated a novel inhibitory activity of LRRc17 in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1974467067,"Background Related protein domains of a superfamily can be specified by proteins of diverse lengths. The structural and functional implications of indels in a domain scaffold have been examined. Methodology In this study, domain superfamilies with large length variations (more than 30% difference from average domain size, referred as ‘length-deviant’ superfamilies and ‘length-rigid’ domain superfamilies (<10% length difference from average domain size) were analyzed for the functional impact of such structural differences. Our delineated dataset, derived from an objective algorithm, enables us to address indel roles in the presence of peculiar structural repeats, functional variation, protein-protein interactions and to examine ‘domain contexts’ of proteins tolerant to large length variations. Amongst the top-10 length-deviant superfamilies analyzed, we found that 80% of length-deviant superfamilies possess distant internal structural repeats and nearly half of them acquired diverse biological functions. In general, length-deviant superfamilies have higher chance, than length-rigid superfamilies, to be engaged in internal structural repeats. We also found that ∼40% of length-deviant domains exist as multi-domain proteins involving interactions with domains from the same or other superfamilies. Indels, in diverse domain superfamilies, were found to participate in the accretion of structural and functional features amongst related domains. With specific examples, we discuss how indels are involved directly or indirectly in the generation of oligomerization interfaces, introduction of substrate specificity, regulation of protein function and stability. Conclusions Our data suggests a multitude of roles for indels that are specialized for domain members of different domain superfamilies. These specialist roles that we observe and trends in the extent of length variation could influence decision making in modeling of new superfamily members. Likewise, the observed limits of length variation, specific for each domain superfamily would be particularly relevant in the choice of alignment length search filters commonly applied in protein sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2061252872,"Background 4E-BP is a translational inhibitor that binds to eIF4E to repress cap-dependent translation initiation. This critical protein:protein interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of 4E-BP. Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP binds to eIF4E and inhibits cap-dependent translation, whereas hyperphosphorylated forms do not. While three 4E-BP proteins exist in mammals, only one gene encoding for 4E-BP is present in the sea urchin genome. The protein product has a highly conserved core domain containing the eIF4E-binding domain motif (YxxxxLΦ) and four of the regulatory phosphorylation sites. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a sea urchin cell-free cap-dependent translation system prepared from fertilized eggs, we provide the first direct evidence that the sea urchin 4E-BP inhibits cap-dependent translation. We show here that a sea urchin 4E-BP variant, mimicking phosphorylation on four core residues required to abrogate binding to eIF4E, surprisingly maintains physical association to eIF4E and inhibits protein synthesis. Conclusions/Significance Here, we examine the involvement of the evolutionarily conserved core domain and phosphorylation sites of sea urchin 4E-BP in the regulation of eIF4E-binding. These studies primarily demonstrate the conserved activity of the 4E-BP translational repressor and the importance of the eIF4E-binding domain in sea urchin. We also show that a variant mimicking hyperphosphorylation of the four regulatory phosphorylation sites common to sea urchin and human 4E-BP is not sufficient for release from eIF4E and translation promotion. Therefore, our results suggest that there are additional mechanisms to that of phosphorylation at the four critical sites of 4E-BP that are required to disrupt binding to eIF4E."
https://openalex.org/W1966353083,"RGK (Rad-Gem-Rem) GTPases have been described as potent negative regulators of the Ca(2+) influx via high-threshold voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels. Recent work, mostly performed on Ca(V)1.2 Ca(2+) channels, has highlighted the crucial role played by the channel auxiliary Ca(V)beta subunits and identified several GTPase and beta-subunit protein domains involved in this regulation. We now extend these conclusions by producing the first complete characterization of the effects of Gem, Rem, and Rem2 on the neuronal Ca(V)2.1 Ca(2+) channels expressed with Ca(V)beta(1) or Ca(V)beta(2) subunits. Current inhibition is limited to a decrease in amplitude with no modification in the voltage dependence or kinetics of the current. We demonstrate that this inhibition can occur for Ca(V)beta constructs with impaired capacity to induce current potentiation, but that it is lost for Ca(V)beta constructs deleted for their beta-interaction domain. The RGK C-terminal last approximately 80 amino acids are sufficient to allow potent current inhibition and in vivo beta-subunit/Gem interaction. Interestingly, although Gem and Gem carboxy-terminus induce a completely different pattern of beta-subunit cellular localization, they both potently inhibit Ca(V)2.1 channels. These data therefore set the status of neuronal Ca(V)2.1 Ca(2+) channel inhibition by RGK GTPases, emphasizing the role of short amino acid sequences of both proteins in beta-subunit binding and channel inhibition and revealing a new mechanism for channel inhibition."

Nitrogenase is a well characterized protein complex that catalyzes the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia in a reaction that requires at least 16 molecules of MgATP (2.Rees D.C. Tezcan F.A. Haynes C.A.

During nitrogenase catalysis, subunit NifH2 (Fe protein) associates with and dissociates from the (NifD/NifK)2 complex (MoFe protein). Binding, hydrolysis of MgATP and structural rearrangements are coupled to sequential intersubunit electron transfer. For this purpose, NifH2 contains an ATP-binding motif and an intersubunit [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by two cysteine residues from each NifH monomer (1.Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Sidow A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 11.Suzuki J.Y. Bollivar D.W. Bauer C.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 61-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Electrons from this [4Fe-4S] cluster are transferred via a [8Fe-7S] cluster (P-cluster) onto the [1Mo-7Fe-9S-X-homocitrate] cluster (MoFe cofactor). Both of the latter clusters are located on (NifD/NifK)2, where dinitrogen is reduced to ammonia (10.Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6737-6744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of NifH2 in complex with (NifD/NifK)2 revealed a detailed picture of the dynamic interaction of both subcomplexes (8.Tezcan F.A. Kaiser J.T. Mustafi D. Walton M.Y.

Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Based on biochemical and bioinformatic approaches, it has been proposed that the initial steps of DPOR reaction strongly resemble nitrogenase catalysis. Key amino acid residues essential for DPOR function have been identified by mutagenesis of the enzyme from Chlorobaculum tepidum (formerly denoted as Chlorobium tepidum) (3.Bröcker M.J. Virus S. Ganskow S. Heathcote P. Heinz D.W. Schubert W.D. Jahn D. Moser J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10559-10567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of DPOR includes the electron transfer from a “plant-type” [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin onto the dimeric DPOR subunit, BchL2, carrying an intersubunit [4Fe-4S] redox center coordinated by Cys97 and Cys131 in C. tepidum. Analogous to nitrogenase, Lys10 in the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) and Leu126 in the switch II region of DPOR were found essential for DPOR catalysis. Moreover, it was shown that the BchL2 protein from C. tepidum does not form a stable complex with the catalytic (BchNB)2 subcomplex. Therefore, a transient interaction responsible for the electron transfer onto protein subunit (BchNB)2 has been proposed (3.Bröcker M.J. Virus S. Ganskow S. Heathcote P. Heinz D.W. Schubert W.D. Jahn D. Moser J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10559-10567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The subsequent [Fe-S] cluster-dependent catalysis and the specific substrate recognition at the active site located on subunit (BchNB)2 are unrelated to nitrogenase. The (BchNB)2 subcomplex was shown to carry a second [4Fe-4S] cluster, which was proposed to be ligated by Cys21, Cys46, and Cys103 of the BchN subunit and Cys94 of subunit BchB (C. tepidum numbering) (3.Bröcker M.J.

No evidence for any type of additional cofactor was obtained from biochemical and EPR spectroscopic analyses (5.Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Uliczka F. Virus S. Saggu M. Lendzian F. Scheer H. Rüdiger W.

Thus, despite the same common oligomeric architecture, the catalytic subunits (BchNB)2 and (ChlNB)2 clearly differ from the corresponding nitrogenase complex, as no molybdenum-containing cofactor or P-cluster equivalent is employed (5.Bröcker M.J. Wätzlich D. Uliczka F. Virus S. Saggu M. Lendzian F. Scheer H. Rüdiger W. Moser J. Jahn D. J. Biol.

From these results it was concluded that electrons from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 are transferred directly onto the Pchlide substrate at the active site of DPOR. The second nitrogenase-like enzyme, COR, catalyzes the reduction of ring B of Chlide during the biosynthesis of Bchl (7.Nomata J. Mizoguchi T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15021-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, an accurate discrimination of the ring systems of the individual substrates is required. COR subunits share an overall amino acid sequence identity of 15–22% for BchY and BchZ and 31–35% for subunit BchX when compared with the corresponding DPOR subunits (Table 1 and supplemental Figures S2–S4). In amino acid sequence alignments of BchX proteins with the closely related BchL or ChlL subunits of DPOR, both cysteinyl ligands responsible for [4Fe-4S] cluster formation and residues for ATP binding are conserved (1.Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Sidow A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all cysteinyl residues characterized as ligands for a catalytic [4Fe-4S] cluster in (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 are conserved in the sequences of subunits BchY and BchZ of COR (7.Nomata J. Mizoguchi T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15021-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These findings correspond to a recent EPR study in which a characteristic signal for a [4Fe-4S] cluster was obtained for the COR subunit BchX2 as well as for subunit (BchYZ)2 (15.Kim E.J. Kim J.S.

We make use of the individually purified DPOR subunits BchL2 and (BchNB)2 from the green sulfur bacterium C. tepidum and ChlL2 and (ChlNB)2 from the prochlorophyte Prochlorococcus marinus and from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The individual combination of (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 complexes and BchL2 or ChlL2 proteins from these organisms resulted in catalytically active chimeras of DPOR. These results enabled us to propose conserved regions of the postulated docking surface, which were subsequently verified in a mutagenesis study. To elucidate the potential evolution of the electron-transferring subunit of nitrogenase and nitrogenase-like enzymes, we also analyzed chimeric enzymes consisting of DPOR subunits (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 in combination with subunits BchX2 from C. tepidum and R. denitrificans of the COR enzyme and with subunit NifH2 of nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii, respectively. Genes chlN and chlB from T. elongatus BP-1 were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers TechlN_for and TechlN_rev for chlN and TechlB_for and TechlB_rev for chlB (primer sequences are given in supplemental Table S1). The Escherichia coli-specific ribosomal binding site was implemented upstream of chlB. PCR fragments for chlN were digested with BamHI/XhoI and for chlB with XhoI/NotI, respectively, and cloned into the BamHI-NotI site of pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) to yield pGEX-TeNB.

The resulting PCR fragments were digested with BamHI/SalI for bchX from C. tepidum and SacI/XhoI for bchX from R. denitrificans and cloned into the BamHI-SalI and SacI-XhoI sites of pET32a (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. The constructs thus obtained were designated pET-CtX and pET-RdX. For the exchange of conserved amino acids in P. marinus DPOR subunits ChlN, ChlB, and ChlL, the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. Amino acid substitutions in ChlN were introduced using primers E66A, L70R, L70D, V107D, and K109S. Oligonucleotides for the exchange of codons in ChlB were G66D, Q101G, and Q101D. For substitutions in ChlL the following primers were used: Y127S and Y127D. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 and BchL2 or ChlL2 were overproduced in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). The following plasmids encoding mentioned subunits were employed: pGEX-CtNB for C. tepidum (BchNB)2, pGEX-CtL for C. tepidum BchL2, pGEX-TeNB for T. elongatus (ChlNB)2, pGEX-TeL for T. elongatus ChlL2, pGEX-PmNB for P. marinus (ChlNB)2, and pGEX-PmL for P. marinus ChlL2. Cells were grown aerobically at 17 °C for the production of the C. tepidum and T. elongatus proteins or at 25 °C for the P. marinus proteins in LB medium containing 1 mm Fe(III) citrate. Protein production was induced with 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After cultivation for 16 h, cultures were supplemented with 1.7 mm dithionite and incubated for a further 2 h in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI) without agitation. All of the following procedures were performed under anaerobic conditions (95% N2, 5% H2, <1 ppm O2), and buffers were saturated with N2 prior to use. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffer A (100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT), and disrupted by a single passage through a French Press® (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 1000 p.s.i. into an anaerobic bottle. After ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. Recombinant fusion protein GST-BchN or GST-ChlN in complex with subunit BchB or ChlB or, alternatively, fusion protein GST-BchL or GST-ChlL alone, was eluted with buffer A containing 15 mm glutathione. GST was cleaved off the target proteins by incubation with 2 units of PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) for 16 h. For subsequent label transfer experiments, affinity-purified proteins (ChlNB)2 and ChlL2 from P. marinus were further purified by gel permeation chromatography under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, protein samples (∼1.5 ml) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml were subjected to a preparative gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 200 26/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (buffer B) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Elution fractions were pooled and concentrated by using a Microcon® centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany; molecular weight cutoff 10,000). His-tagged COR BchX2 subunits were produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) carrying plasmids pET-CtX encoding C. tepidum BchX2 and pET-RdX encoding R. denitrificans BchX2. Cells were grown aerobically at 17 °C in LB medium containing 1 mm Fe(III)-citrate. Recombinant protein production was induced by addition of 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After further cultivation for 16 h, cultures were incubated for 2 h in an anaerobic chamber. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffer B, and disrupted by a single passage through a French press (SLM-Aminco) at 1000 p.s.i. under anaerobic conditions. After ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was applied onto a nickel-loaded chelating Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B. After extensive washing with buffer C (100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2), proteins were eluted with buffer C containing 200 mm imidazole. The His tag was removed from the target protein by incubation with 2 units of thrombin (Novagen) for 16 h. Analytical gel permeation chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) under anaerobic conditions. After calibration of the column with marker proteins (molecular weight marker kit, Sigma-Aldrich) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, 250-μl samples (∼3–5 mg/ml) of T. elongatus (ChlNB)2 and C. tepidum BchX2 were run under identical conditions. Protein elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The concentration of purified (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 proteins was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the quantification of GST fusion proteins with subunits BchL2 or ChlL2 in cell-free extracts of E. coli, a GST detection module (GE Healthcare) was used. Alternatively, protein concentration was determined densitometrically using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). UV-visible light spectra of recombinantly purified (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 and BchX2 proteins were recorded under anaerobic conditions using a V-550 spectrophotometer (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). The iron content of purified (ChlNB)2 and BchX2 proteins was measured colorimetrically with bathophenantroline following acid denaturation as described previously (18.Lovenberg W. Buchanan B.B. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3899-3913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified ChlL2 protein from P. marinus after preparative gel permeation chromatography was labeled with the trifunctional label transfer reagent Mts-Atf-LC-biotin (Pierce). In addition to a biotin moiety, this reagent contains a sulfhydryl-specific methane thiosulfonate (Mts) group, which can form disulfide bonds with free sulfhydryl groups of the ChlL2 protein. After exposure to UV light, the photoreactive tetrafluorophenyl azide (Atf) moiety of the cross-linker inserts into carbon hydrogen bonds and unsaturated carbon chains of the protein within a distance of 21.8 Å. Upon the addition of reducing agents, the disulfide bond is cleaved and the biotin label is transferred to the interacting protein partner. All procedures for the labeling experiments were performed with low levels of reductant (<1 mm DTT) and under subdued light to prevent premature loss of the label and activation of the Atf moiety. Purified ChlL2 from P. marinus was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of Mts-Atf-LC-biotin in a total reaction volume of 500 μl in phosphate-buffered saline (100 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). After incubation for 1 h at 21 °C, the unbound reagent was removed by dialysis using Slide-A-Lyzer® MINI dialysis units (Pierce). Label transfer experiments contained 25 μm (ChlNB)2 from P. marinus and the corresponding biotinylated ChlL2 protein (ChlL2-Mts-Atf-LC-biotin; 70 μm) in a volume of 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Assays also contained 2 mm ATP, an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 10 units of creatine phosphokinase, and the DPOR substrate Pchlide at a concentration of 13 μm. Complex formation was initiated for 5 min at 21 °C. Then the cross-linking reaction was induced by exposure to UV light using a CAMAG UV lamp (365 nm; 2 × 8 watts) for 30 min at a distance of 5 cm. 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (19.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing the reducing agent DTT at a concentration of 100 mm was added. Thereby, the ChlL2 protein was liberated from the cross-linked complex, resulting in the transfer of the biotin label onto the (ChlNB)2 protein. In control experiments the (ChlNB)2 complex or the ChlL2 protein was omitted. Furthermore, negative controls were performed by substituting (ChlNB)2 with bovine serum albumin. All samples were subsequently analyzed via 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Trans-Blot apparatus semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions. Biotin-labeled proteins were detected by using a NeutrAvidin antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Functional DPOR enzymes from C. tepidum, P. marinus, and T. elongatus were reconstituted by supplementing 100 pmol of purified (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 with 200 pmol of purified BchL2 or ChlL2, respectively, in a total volume of 125 μl in 100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The assays contained 2 mm ATP, an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 10 units of creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium dithionite as an electron donor, and the substrate Pchlide at 13 μm. Pchlide was isolated from the bchL-deficient Rhodobacter capsulatus mutant strain ZY5 as described previously (3.Bröcker M.J. Virus S. Ganskow S. Heathcote P. Heinz D.W. Schubert W.D. Jahn D.

Samples were incubated under strict anaerobic conditions for 15 to 60 min in the dark at varying temperatures ranging from 20 to 50 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of acetone. After centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy using a V-550 spectrophotometer (Jasco). The DPOR reaction product, Chlide, shows a characteristic peak at 665 nm, whereas the substrate possesses an absorption maximum at 626 nm. For the quantification of Pchlide and Chlide, extinction coefficients of ϵ626 = 30.4 mm−1 cm−1 for Pchlide and ϵ665 = 74.9 mm−1 cm−1 for Chlide were used (17.Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20.McFeeters R.F. Chichester C.O. Whitaker J.R. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47: 609-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The detection limit of the assay is at 15.75 nmol min−1 mg−1. All subsequent assays for the various DPOR systems were standardized at 35 °C allowing for the determination of specific activities under identical conditions. For this standard DPOR assay, 100 pmol of purified (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 was combined with 1–80 μl of a cell-free E. coli extract containing 0.05–300 pmol of the overproduced BchL2 or ChlL2 protein, respectively. The specific activities obtained were set as 100%, and all other values (values of chimeric DPOR enzymes and mutant DPOR enzymes) were related to this. In all cases, assays were completed by control experiments in which the BchL2 or ChlL2 protein, the (BchNB)2 or (ChlNB)2 complex, or alternatively the co-substrate ATP was omitted. The DPOR subcomplex (BchNB)2 from C. tepidum or (ChlNB)2 from P. marinus and T. elongatus was combined with protein subunit BchX2 of the COR enzyme from C. tepidu"
https://openalex.org/W1964201309,"Background The pathogenicity of the Vibrio cholerae strains belonging to serogroup O1 and O139 is due to the production of virulence factors such as cholera toxin (CT) and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). The remaining serogroups, which mostly lack CT and TCP, are more frequently isolated from aquatic environmental sources than from clinical samples; nevertheless, these strains have been reported to cause human disease, such as sporadic outbreaks of watery diarrhoea and inflammatory enterocolitis. This evidence suggested the possibility that other virulence factor(s) than cholera toxin might be crucial in the pathogenesis of Vibrio cholerae-induced diarrhoea, but their nature remains unknown. VCC, the hemolysin produced by virtually all Vibrio cholerae strains, has been proposed as a possible candidate, though a clear-cut demonstration attesting VCC as crucial in the pathogenesis of Vibrio cholerae-induced diarrhoea is still lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings Electrophysiological parameters and paracellular permeability of stripped human healthy colon tissues, obtained at subtotal colectomy, mounted in Ussing chamber were studied in the presence or absence of VCC purified from culture supernatants of V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain. Short circuit current (ISC) and transepithelial resistance (RT) were measured by a computerized voltage clamp system. The exposure of sigmoid colon specimens to 1 nM VCC resulted in an increase of ISC by 20.7%, with respect to the basal values, while RT was reduced by 12.3%. Moreover, increase in ISC was abolished by bilateral Cl− reduction. Conclusion/Significance Our results demonstrate that VCC, by forming anion channels on the apical membrane of enterocytes, triggers an outward transcellular flux of chloride. Such an ion movement, associated with the outward movement of Na+ and water, might be responsible for the diarrhoea caused by the non-toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae."
https://openalex.org/W1989643384,"To understand the mechanism for ion transport through the sodium/bicarbonate transporter SLC4A4 (NBCe1), we examined amino acid residues, within transmembrane domains, that are conserved among electrogenic Na/HCO(3) transporters but are substituted with residues at the corresponding site of all electroneutral Na/HCO(3) transporters. Point mutants were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes to assess function using two-electrode voltage clamp. Among the mutants, D555E (charge-conserved substitution of the aspartate at position 555 with a glutamate) produced decreasing HCO(3)(-) currents at more positive membrane voltages. Immunohistochemistry showed D555E protein expression in oocyte membranes. D555E induced Na/HCO(3)-dependent pH recovery from a CO(2)-induced acidification. Current-voltage relationships revealed that D555E produced an outwardly rectifying current in the nominally CO(2)/HCO(3)(-)-free solution that was abolished by Cl(-) removal from the bath. In the presence of CO(2)/HCO(3)(-), however, the outward current produced by D555E decreased only slightly after Cl(-) removal. Starting from a Cl(-)-free condition, D555E produced dose-dependent outward currents in response to a series of chloride additions. The D555E-mediated chloride current decreased by 70% in the presence of CO(2)/HCO(3)(-). The substitution of Asp(555) with an asparagine also produced a Cl(-) current. Anion selectivity experiments revealed that D555E was broadly permissive to other anions including NO(3)(-). Fluorescence measurements of chloride transport were done with human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells expressing NBCe1 and D555E. A marked increase in chloride transport was detected in cells expressing D555E. We conclude that Asp(555) plays a role in HCO(3)(-) selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2083857745,"The mammalian Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, NCX1.1, serves as the main mechanism for Ca(2+) efflux across the sarcolemma following cardiac contraction. In addition to transporting Ca(2+), NCX1.1 activity is also strongly regulated by Ca(2+) binding to two intracellular regulatory domains, CBD1 and CBD2. The structures of both of these domains have been solved by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography, greatly enhancing our understanding of Ca(2+) regulation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which Ca(2+) regulates the exchanger remain incompletely understood. The initial NMR study showed that the first regulatory domain, CBD1, unfolds in the absence of regulatory Ca(2+). It was further demonstrated that a mutation of an acidic residue involved in Ca(2+) binding, E454K, prevents this structural unfolding. A contradictory result was recently obtained in a second NMR study in which Ca(2+) removal merely triggered local rearrangements of CBD1. To address this issue, we solved the crystal structure of the E454K-CBD1 mutant and performed electrophysiological analyses of the full-length exchanger with mutations at position 454. We show that the lysine substitution replaces the Ca(2+) ion at position 1 of the CBD1 Ca(2+) binding site and participates in a charge compensation mechanism. Electrophysiological analyses show that mutations of residue Glu-454 have no impact on Ca(2+) regulation of NCX1.1. Together, structural and mutational analyses indicate that only two of the four Ca(2+) ions that bind to CBD1 are important for regulating exchanger activity."
https://openalex.org/W2000392436,"The enzymatic activity of the peripheral membrane protein, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), is increased by nonsubstrate phospholipids with the extent of enhancement tuned by the membrane lipid composition. For Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC, a small amount of phosphatidylcholine (PC) activates the enzyme toward its substrate PI; above 0.5 mol fraction PC (XPC), enzyme activity decreases substantially. To provide a molecular basis for this PC-dependent behavior, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to explore enzyme binding to multicomponent lipid vesicles composed of PC and anionic phospholipids (that bind to the active site as substrate analogues) and high resolution field cycling 31P NMR methods to estimate internal correlation times (τc) of phospholipid headgroup motions. PI-PLC binds poorly to pure anionic phospholipid vesicles, but 0.1 XPC significantly enhances binding, increases PI-PLC activity, and slows nanosecond rotational/wobbling motions of both phospholipid headgroups, as indicated by increased τc. PI-PLC activity and phospholipid τc are constant between 0.1 and 0.5 XPC. Above this PC content, PI-PLC has little additional effect on the substrate analogue but further slows the PC τc, a motional change that correlates with the onset of reduced enzyme activity. For PC-rich bilayers, these changes, together with the reduced order parameter and enhanced lateral diffusion of the substrate analogue in the presence of PI-PLC, imply that at high XPC, kinetic inhibition of PI-PLC results from intravesicle sequestration of the enzyme from the bulk of the substrate.

Wei Z. Goldfine H. Shen H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 8011-8016Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas the structurally homologous mammalian PLCδ1 and related enzymes are required for phosphoinositide metabolism and are important for intracellular signaling (2Downes C.P. Gray A. Lucocq J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). These peripheral membrane proteins often have distinct binding modes for substrates and for other lipids that either anchor the protein to the surface or adjust its conformation to enhance catalysis (4Mulgrew-Nesbitt A.

However, using traditional methods, it has been difficult to determine how lipid composition affects phospholipase binding and, conversely, how protein binding alters the lipid environment, particularly in multicomponent vesicles. Current methods for monitoring peripheral membrane protein binding to mixed component lipid vesicles, including centrifugation, gel filtration, and NMR, can provide information on bulk protein partitioning but do not usually provide insight into how the properties of the individual phospholipids change when protein is bound. Most of these methods also require protein concentrations well above the amounts used in enzyme kinetics. Therefore, even when binding to multicomponent vesicles can be measured, it has been difficult to separate how substrates (or substrate analogues) and activators interact with enzymes, such as PI-PLC, that catalyze interfacial reactions. phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C Alexa Fluor 488 C5 chemical shift anisotropy dynamic light scattering high resolution field cycling 31P NMR spectroscopy fluorescence correlation spectroscopy large unilamellar vesicles dioleoylphosphatidic acid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol dioleoyl-phosphatidylmethanol dioleoylphosphatidylserine small unilamellar vesicle Tesla glycosylphosphatidylinositol. phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C Alexa Fluor 488 C5 chemical shift anisotropy dynamic light scattering high resolution field cycling 31P NMR spectroscopy fluorescence correlation spectroscopy large unilamellar vesicles dioleoylphosphatidic acid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol dioleoyl-phosphatidylmethanol dioleoylphosphatidylserine small unilamellar vesicle Tesla glycosylphosphatidylinositol. Protein binding to lipid vesicles or cells greatly retards protein translational diffusion. For fluorescently labeled proteins, this change can easily be monitored using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (5Magde D. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 29-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 6Rhoades E. Ramlall T.F. Webb W.W. Eliezer D. Biophys.

FCS uses low protein concentrations (<1–50 nm), comparable with what is used in kinetic assays, and experiments can be performed in minutes. Thus, FCS allows us to screen different phospholipid compositions and to identify conditions that can be studied in detail by other techniques aimed at probing how protein binding alters the lipid environment. One such technique is high resolution field cycling 31P NMR spectroscopy (fc-P-NMR) (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17066-17071Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bacterial PI-PLCs recognize the headgroups of substrate, substrate analogue, and activator phospholipids, making 31P NMR an obvious choice for studying protein-lipid interactions. Measurements of dipolar relaxation rates could, in principle, determine the effects of protein binding on headgroup orientation with respect to the bilayer normal as well as correlation times for different headgroup motions. However, in a typical modern spectrometer, the slow rotational diffusion time of lipid vesicles, the dominance of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) relaxation, and a plethora of faster motions at higher fields preclude obtaining information on lipid structure and dynamics from relaxation rates. This limitation is avoided by fc-P-NMR spin lattice relaxation techniques that resolve the dynamics of each phospholipid component in mixed component vesicles by using the high field to separate resonances but allowing nuclei to relax at defined lower fields. To cycle the magnetic field, the sample is mechanically shuttled between the center high field region of the commercial NMR magnet's probe and a substantially lower magnetic field located above the probe before and after the delay times normally used in conventional NMR relaxation sequences (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis of the field dependence of spin lattice relaxation rates over a wide field range (0.002–11.7 T) provides several correlation times (τ) for each phospholipid molecule on time scales ranging from ps to μs and also allows us to separate dipolar and CSA interactions (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17066-17071Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the intermediate 5–10 ns τc that appears to be dominated by the wobbling of each phospholipid in the membrane (10Klauda J.B. Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Brooks B.R. Pastor R.W. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 3074-3083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This τc provides a direct probe of lipid dynamics in these multicomponent membranes. A longer correlation time in the μs range, τv, provides information on how vesicle tumbling and lateral diffusion affect the phosphorus nuclei for each type of phospholipid in a mixed vesicle. We have used FCS and fc-P-NMR to probe the interactions of Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC with small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). This enzyme and related, secreted bacterial PI-PLCs are important for bacterial virulence, and explicit measurements of their interactions with lipids could aid in inhibitor design. Bacterial PI-PLCs are also structurally homologous to the catalytic domain of mammalian PLCδ1 and thus provide a good model for assessing how interactions of this domain with membrane components could modulate enzyme activity. B. thuringiensis PI-PLC has a solvent-accessible active site inserted into a relatively rigid (αβ)-barrel (11Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The enzyme exhibits higher specific activity toward small unilamellar vesicles (∼300 Å diameter) over larger vesicles with diameters of ≥1000 Å (12Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6513-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For soluble substrates, the presence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in micelles or vesicles activates the enzyme by decreasing the apparent Km and increasing kcat for both the phosphotransferase and phosphodiesterase steps (13Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PC activation of PI cleavage, the interfacial reaction, also occurs with vesicle assay systems (12Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F.

However, in all PI vesicle assay systems examined, when the bulk PI is kept constant but the surface concentration decreases, PI-PLC specific activity decreases dramatically above XPC = 0.50 (12Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6513-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Volwerk J.J. Filthuth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This surface dilution inhibition is often interpreted as the result of the substrate surface concentration decreasing below a two-dimensional Km measured in mole fraction PI (XPI) units (19Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 20Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The affinity of the diluent (in this case PC) for the enzyme can also complicate a detailed interpretation of this kinetic effect. To truly understand this PI-PLC, where two discrete phospholipids are critical for optimal catalysis, we need a molecular level description of surface dilution inhibition. Our results clearly indicate a role for lipid dynamics in PI-PLC activation by PC at low XPC and reduced activity of PI-PLC at XPC > 0.5. Specifically, these experiments reveal the following. (i) A relatively small amount of activator PC in the anionic lipid membrane promotes PI-PLC binding to vesicles. (ii) The affinity of the protein for vesicles increases as the amount of PC is increased. Affinities for SUVs reach a maximum for very PC-rich, but not pure PC, bilayers, indicating that both phospholipids contribute to tight vesicle binding (a synergistic effect between activator and active site binding of lipids). (iii) At moderate XPC, 0.1 < XPC < 0.5, the dynamics of both phospholipids are affected similarly, and the restricted, slower motions, which are more or less independent of XPC, parallel the high enzymatic activity. (iv) In the regime of tight binding to PC-rich bilayers, PC dynamics are preferentially slowed, suggesting that this activator lipid sequesters PI-PLC from the bulk of the substrate analogues, leading to significantly lower specific activity than would be expected. This latter observation provides a very specific interpretation of surface dilution inhibition as the result of tight binding of the protein to PC-rich regions that prevents its access to the bulk of the PI. All lipid stock solutions (dioleoyl chains for all of the anionic phospholipids and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine as the PC species) in chloroform were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The chloroform was removed under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the resultant film was lyophilized overnight. The lipid film was rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.3, for FCS experiments or 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for enzyme assays and for 31P NMR field cycling. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by multiple passages of the aqueous lipid solutions through polycarbonate membranes (100-nm pore diameter) using a miniextruder from Avanti. SUVs in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, were prepared by sonication (Branson Sonifier cell disrupter) of lipid mixtures for 30 min on ice. To introduce a fluorescent lipid into the SUVs, 1:20,000 mol fraction dipalmitoyl-lissamine-rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti) was added into the SUVs, and the mixture was sonicated for another 3 min. Under these conditions, a very small amount of fatty acid may be generated by hydrolysis of the phospholipids. However, no resonances for lyso-phospholipids were observed in a sample of PC/PI (1:1) treated in this fashion, indicating that the amount of lipid hydrolysis in this preparation was less than 0.5 mol %. Previous kinetic experiments have shown that small amounts of fatty acids do not affect enzyme specific activity (13Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The SUVs had a narrow vesicle size distribution as assessed by dynamic light scattering (21Maulucci G. De Spirito M. Arcovito G. Boffi F. Castellano A.C. Briganti G. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3545-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) using a Protein Solutions DynaProdynamic light scattering instrument from Wyatt Technology (22Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). The anion-rich SUVs were slightly smaller, with a narrower size distribution than PC-rich SUVs. All of the SUVs were used within 1 week of preparation. Recombinant B. thuringiensis PI-PLC was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (15Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were assessed by both 280 nm absorption and Lowry assays. Samples for fc-P-NMR were prepared with 10 mm total (dioleoylphosphatidylmethanol (PMe) plus PC) phospholipid and 0.5 or 3 mg/ml PI-PLC (0.014 or 0.086 mm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. EDTA (1 mm) was present to scavenge any paramagnetic ions in solution. Fluorescently labeled PI-PLC was prepared from the N168C mutant protein, constructed using the QuikChange methodology (Stratagene). The altered gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genewiz). N168C was fluorescently labeled using Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide (AF488 maleimide; Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. AF488 does not bind to vesicles (7Rusu L. Gambhir A. McLaughlin S. Rädler J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1044-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and this was confirmed by performing FCS experiments in the presence of free AF488 and SUVs. A labeling ratio of 100 ± 10% was determined by comparing the absorption of the protein at 280 nm with that of the probe at 495 nm. Specific activities of recombinant B. thuringiensis PI-PLC toward PI in SUVs with varying mole fractions of PC were measured by 31P NMR spectroscopy (13Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Volwerk J.J. Shashidhar M.S. Kuppe A. Griffith O.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8056-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Each sample was in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In parallel to the fc-P-NMR studies, the total phospholipid concentration of the vesicles was 10 mm, with the mole fraction PC varying from 0.0 to 0.9. The amount of enzyme added, 0.2–5 μg (corresponding to concentrations of 5.8–144 nm), and the incubation time were chosen to allow less than 20% PI cleavage for each sample. Samples were incubated for fixed times at 28 °C, and the reaction was quenched by adding 40 μl of acetic acid to a 1-ml sample. Triton X-100 (100 μl) was added to solubilize the phospholipids for analysis by 31P NMR. In these assays, myoinositol 1,2-(cyclic)-phosphate was the only product, and the specific activity was calculated according to integration of the myoinositol 1,2-(cyclic)-phosphate resonance compared with an internal standard (protons were not decoupled in these experiments). FCS experiments were performed using a previously described (24Liu L. Mushero N. Hedstrom L. Gershenson A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10865-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) home-built confocal setup based on an IX-70 inverted microscope (Olympus). Further details on the apparatus and data treatment are provided in the supplemental material. FCS experiments were carried out at 22 °C on 300-μl samples in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, to stabilize PI-PLC, in chambered coverglass wells (LabTek). Prior to use, the chambers were coated with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer to prevent protein adhesion to the sides of the wells. For PI-PLC vesicle binding experiments, 3.5 nm labeled protein was titrated with unlabeled vesicles. The substrate, PI, was not used for FCS experiments, because PI cleavage by PI-PLC produces diacylglycerol, leading to vesicle fusion (25Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biosci. Rep. 2000; 20: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the anionic phospholipids PMe, PG, PA, or PS were used as substrate analogues. PG is a PI-PLC substrate and can be cleaved over a period of days by >1 mg/ml concentrations of PI-PLC (18Volwerk J.J. Filthuth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10089-10097Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, at the low protein concentrations used in the FCS experiments, no detectable hydrolysis of PG occurred. The auto- and cross-correlation, Gj,k(τ), were calculated from the time-dependent fluorescence intensities (27Elson E.L. Magde D. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 1-27Crossref Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 28Thompson N.L. Lakowicz J. Topics in Fluorescence Microscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991: 337-378Google Scholar). To measure the average diffusion coefficient of the SUVs, FCS experiments were performed on SUVs containing a small amount (0.5 μm) of rhodamine-labeled PC. Diffusion coefficients of free, AF488-labeled PI-PLC (DPI-PLC) and labeled SUVs (DSUV) were 58 ± 5 μm2 s−1 (corresponding to a diffusion time (τD) = 173 μs) and 10.4 ± 1.0 μm2 s−1 (τD = 1.48 ms), respectively. In the presence of labeled PI-PLC and unlabeled lipid vesicles, FCS auto- and cross-correlations, G(τ), were analyzed using two-component, diffusion-only fits (5Magde D. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 29-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 29Takakuwa Y. Pack C.G. An X.L. Manno S. Ito E. Kinjo M. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar),G(τ)=1⟨N⟩{(1−f)((1+ττD,free)1+τS2τD,free)−1+f((1+ττD,bound)1+τS2τD,bound)−1}(Eq. 1) where 〈N〉 is the time-averaged number of PI-PLC molecules in the observation volume, f is the fraction of PI-PLC bound to vesicles, and τD,free and τD,bound are the diffusion times for free and vesicle-bound PI-PLC, respectively. For 488-nm excitation, values of S (related to the observation volume) were between 6.8 and 8. The 31P field cycling spin lattice relaxation rate (R1) experiments were made at 25 °C on a Varian Unityplus 500 spectrometer using a standard 10-mm Varian probe in a custom-built device that moves the sample, sealed in a 10-mm tube, from the sample probe location to a higher position within, or just above, the magnet, where the magnetic field is between 0.06 and 11.7 T (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Roberts M.F. Cui Q. Turner C.J. Case D.A. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Spin lattice relaxation rates at each field strength were measured using 6–8 programmed delay times and analysis of the data with an exponential function to extract R1 = 1/T1. Although the details of the R1 measurement for SUVs and the analysis to obtain and model R1 as a function of field have been described previously (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17066-17071Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a more detailed discussion of the methodology, data analysis, and associated assumptions is presented in the supplemental material. The field dependence of the 31P relaxation rates was analyzed in two discrete segments. R1 from 0.06 up to 11.7 T was fit with contributions from three terms (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Roberts M.F. Cui Q. Turner C.J. Case D.A. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): (i) dipolar relaxation associated with a correlation time, τc, typically in the 5–10 ns range and Rc(0), the maximum relaxation rate for this correlation time, which is directly proportional to τc and inversely proportional to rP-H6 (Rc(0) = τc (μo/4π)2 (h/2π)2γP2γH2 rPH−6), where rP-H indicates the average distance between the phosphorus and its nearest proton neighbors; (ii) CSA relaxation associated with the same slow correlation time (from which we can extract SC2, an order parameter squared (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)); and (iii) CSA relaxation due to a faster motion (it is this term that dominates relaxation at high fields and is distinguished by a square law dependence). R1 in the field range 0.06–11.7 T is then the sum of these three terms,R1=(Rc(0)/2τc)(0.1J(ωH−ωP)+0.3J(ωP)+0.6J(ωH+ωP))+CLωP2J(ωP)+CHH2(Eq. 2) where J(ω) = 2τc/(1 + ω2τc2), and the field, H, is the magnetic field measured in tesla; the coefficient CL = (1/15)(1 + η2/3)σ2SC2. In these expressions, γ represents the gyromagnetic ratio (for 1H or 31P), and σ and η are the CSA interaction size and asymmetry for phospholipids (8Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The last term is for a faster motion and is not of interest in this work. A protein interacting with a given phospholipid would be expected to slow the motion associated with τc as well as increase SC2. A second distinct increase in R1 can be measured at very low fields (<0.03 T). The data in this low field regime are fit to a term added to Rc(0) for dipolar relaxation with a submicrosecond correlation time, τv, and a maximum extrapolated relaxation rate of Rv(0) for this slower motion (9Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17066-17071Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).R1=(Rv(0)/2τv)(0.1J(ωH−ωP)+0.3J(ωP)+0.6J(ωH+ωP))+Rc(0)(Eq. 3) The parameter τv primarily reflects vesicle tumbling, although lateral diffusion also contributes to this value. For two phospholipids in the same vesicle, a change in τv in the presence of protein can provide information on segregation of phospholipids (and faster lateral diffusion of one versus the other). The specific activity (μmol min−1 mg−1) of PI-PLC toward PI-containing SUVs with a fixed enzyme and total lipid concentration (10 mm) and increasing mole fractions of the activator PC, XPC, was determined. To emphasize the initial activation and eventual inhibition, the PI-PLC relative activity (specific activity normalized to the value obtained for pure PI SUVs, 91.3 ± 9.2 μmol min−1 mg−1) is presented in Fig. 1. Although there is considerable error when averaging different series of experiments with SUVs, the trends are always the same. As little as 0.10 XPC increases the enzyme activity toward PI 2–3-fold, and the activity is more or less constant from 0.10 to 0.50 XPC. The magnitude of this activation depends on the concentration of PI and on the PC species; for example, a 7-fold activation was reported previously using 0.2 mol fraction dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (12Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6513-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Apparent Km values for pure PI SUVs (derived from treating the system as if it followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics) have been estimated as 3–5 mm (12Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6513-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which might suggest that the large kinetic effect of PC is from enhanced protein binding (12Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6513-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Zhou C. Qian X. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10089-10097C"
https://openalex.org/W1968207636,"Background The BIO14.6 hamster is an excellent animal model for inherited cardiomyopathy, because of its lethal and well-documented course, due to a spontaneous deletion of delta-sarcoglycan gene promoter and first exon. The muscle disease is progressive and average lifespan is 11 months, because heart slowly dilates towards heart failure. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on the ability of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to transduce heart together with skeletal muscle following systemic administration, we delivered human delta-sarcoglycan cDNA into male BIO14.6 hamsters by testing different ages of injection, routes of administration and AAV serotypes. Body-wide restoration of delta-SG expression was associated with functional reconstitution of the sarcoglycan complex and with significant lowering of centralized nuclei and fibrosis in skeletal muscle. Motor ability and cardiac functions were completely rescued. However, BIO14.6 hamsters having less than 70% of fibers recovering sarcoglycan developed cardiomyopathy, even if the total rescued protein was normal. When we used serotype 2/8 in combination with serotype 2/1, lifespan was extended up to 22 months with sustained heart function improvement. Conclusions/Significance Our data support multiple systemic administrations of AAV as a general therapeutic strategy for clinical trials in cardiomyopathies and muscle disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2036402461,"Ovarian cancer is the second most prevalent gynecologic cancer in women. However, it is by far the most lethal. This is generally attributed to the absence of easily detectable markers specific to ovarian cancers that can be used for early diagnosis and specific therapeutic targets.Using end point PCR we have found that a family of retrogenes, previously thought to be expressed only in the male testis during spermatogenesis in man, are also expressed in normal ovarian tissue and a large percentage of ovarian cancers. In man there are at least eleven such autosomal retrogenes, which are intronless copies of genes on the X chromosome, essential for normal spermatogenesis and expressed specifically in the human testis. We tested for the expression of five of the known retrogenes, UTP14C, PGK2, RPL10L, RPL39L and UBL4B in normal human ovary and ovarian cancers.We propose that the activation of the testis specific retrogenes in the ovary and ovarian cancers is of biological significance in humans. Because these retrogenes are specifically expressed in the ovary and ovarian cancers in the female they may prove useful in developing new diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1975280345,"Objective To investigate the extent to which shared genetic factors can explain the clustering of depression among individuals with lower socioeconomic status, and to examine if neuroticism or intelligence are involved in these pathways. Methods In total 2,383 participants (1,028 men and 1,355 women) of the Erasmus Rucphen Family Study were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D). Socioeconomic status was assessed as the highest level of education obtained. The role of shared genetic factors was quantified by estimating genetic correlations (ρG) between symptoms of depression and education level, with and without adjustment for premorbid intelligence and neuroticism scores. Results Higher level of education was associated with lower depression scores (partial correlation coefficient −0.09 for CES-D and −0.17 for HADS-D). Significant genetic correlations were found between education and both CES-D (ρG = −0.65) and HADS-D (ρG = −0.50). The genetic correlations remained statistically significant after adjusting for premorbid intelligence and neuroticism scores. Conclusions Our study suggests that shared genetic factors play a role in the co-occurrence of lower socioeconomic status and symptoms of depression, which suggest that genetic factors play a role in health inequalities. Further research is needed to investigate the validity, causality and generalizability of our results."
https://openalex.org/W1991029813,"Knowledge of specific domain-domain interactions (DDIs) is essential to understand the functional significance of protein interaction networks. Despite the availability of an enormous amount of data on protein-protein interactions (PPIs), very little is known about specific DDIs occurring in them. Here, we present a top-down approach to accurately infer functionally relevant DDIs from PPI data. We created a comprehensive, non-redundant dataset of 209,165 experimentally-derived PPIs by combining datasets from five major interaction databases. We introduced an integrated scoring system that uses a novel combination of a set of five orthogonal scoring features covering the probabilistic, evolutionary, evidence-based, spatial and functional properties of interacting domains, which can map the interacting propensity of two domains in many dimensions. This method outperforms similar existing methods both in the accuracy of prediction and in the coverage of domain interaction space. We predicted a set of 52,492 high-confidence DDIs to carry out cross-species comparison of DDI conservation in eight model species including human, mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, Plasmodium, E. coli and Arabidopsis. Our results show that only 23% of these DDIs are conserved in at least two species and only 3.8% in at least 4 species, indicating a rather low conservation across species. Pair-wise analysis of DDI conservation revealed a ‘sliding conservation’ pattern between the evolutionarily neighboring species. Our methodology and the high-confidence DDI predictions generated in this study can help to better understand the functional significance of PPIs at the modular level, thus can significantly impact further experimental investigations in systems biology research."
https://openalex.org/W1985297433,"All tumor cell lines that have been tested are defective for Myc auto-repression, and have high levels of Myc produced from wild type loci and re-arranged loci. Like mammalian Myc auto-repression, Myc protein represses the expression of its gene, dmyc, in Drosophila. This activity requires Polycomb (Pc), since RNAi for Pc in the embryo eliminates Myc auto-repression. We have observed that upon depletion of Polycomb in the embryo, levels of one of 18 different chromatin-binding genetic regulators, Su(z)2, rise dramatically. We pursued the possibility that increased levels of this protein, Su(z)2, interfere with Myc auto-repression, potentially explaining the loss of auto-repression upon Pc RNAi. We report that embryos expressing both ectopic Myc and ectopic Su(z)2 fail in Myc auto-repression. Surprisingly, histone H3K27 tri-methylation at the dmyc locus is inversely correlated with the presence of auto-repression. We show phenotypic consequences of potent dmyc auto-repression, and their complete reversal by ectopic Su(z)2: dmyc auto-repression induced a diminutive (dm) phenotype, and upon elimination of auto-repression by Su(z)2, overall levels of Myc increased and completely rescued the phenotype. We show that this increase in Myc levels caused dramatic activation of Myc activation targets. These data suggest that Su(z)2 is capable of increasing the potency of Myc activity by eliminating Myc's feedback regulation by auto-repression. Although Su(z)2 eliminated Myc auto-repression, we found that Myc repression of other genes is not affected by Su(z)2. These data suggest a unique antagonistic role for Su(z)2 in Myc auto-repression, and a potential mechanism for cancer-cell specific loss of Myc auto-repression."
https://openalex.org/W2036921260,"We employed a parametric psychophysical design in combination with functional imaging to examine the influence of metric changes in perceptual incongruence on perceptual alternation rates and cortical responses. Subjects viewed a bistable stimulus defined by incongruent depth cues; bistability resulted from incongruence between binocular disparity and monocular perspective cues that specify different slants (slant rivalry). Psychophysical results revealed that perceptual alternation rates were positively correlated with the degree of perceived incongruence. Functional imaging revealed systematic increases in activity that paralleled the psychophysical results within anterior intraparietal sulcus, prior to the onset of perceptual alternations. We suggest that this cortical activity predicts the frequency of subsequent alternations, implying a putative causal role for these areas in initiating bistable perception. In contrast, areas implicated in form and depth processing (LOC and V3A) were sensitive to the degree of slant, but failed to show increases in activity when these cues were in conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2011214487,"The first-degree power-law polynomial function is frequently used to describe activity metabolism for steady swimming animals. This function has been used in hydrodynamics-based metabolic studies to evaluate important parameters of energetic costs, such as the standard metabolic rate and the drag power indices. In theory, however, the power-law polynomial function of any degree greater than one can be used to describe activity metabolism for steady swimming animals. In fact, activity metabolism has been described by the conventional exponential function and the cubic polynomial function, although only the power-law polynomial function models drag power since it conforms to hydrodynamic laws. Consequently, the first-degree power-law polynomial function yields incorrect parameter values of energetic costs if activity metabolism is governed by the power-law polynomial function of any degree greater than one. This issue is important in bioenergetics because correct comparisons of energetic costs among different steady swimming animals cannot be made unless the degree of the power-law polynomial function derives from activity metabolism. In other words, a hydrodynamics-based functional form of activity metabolism is a power-law polynomial function of any degree greater than or equal to one. Therefore, the degree of the power-law polynomial function should be treated as a parameter, not as a constant. This new treatment not only conforms to hydrodynamic laws, but also ensures correct comparisons of energetic costs among different steady swimming animals. Furthermore, the exponential power-law function, which is a new hydrodynamics-based functional form of activity metabolism, is a special case of the power-law polynomial function. Hence, the link between the hydrodynamics of steady swimming and the exponential-based metabolic model is defined."
https://openalex.org/W2029053352,"Previous research has shown that academic physicians conflicted by funding from the pharmaceutical industry have corrupted evidence based medicine and helped enlarge the market for drugs. Physicians made pharmaceutical-friendly statements, engaged in disease mongering, and signed biased review articles ghost-authored by corporate employees. This paper tested the hypothesis that bias affects review articles regarding rimonabant, an anti-obesity drug that blocks the central cannabinoid receptor.A MEDLINE search was performed for rimonabant review articles, limited to articles authored by USA physicians who served as consultants for the company that manufactures rimonabant. Extracted articles were examined for industry-friendly bias, identified by three methods: analysis with a validated instrument for monitoring bias in continuing medical education (CME); analysis for bias defined as statements that ran contrary to external evidence; and a tally of misrepresentations about the endocannabinoid system. Eight review articles were identified, but only three disclosed authors' financial conflicts of interest, despite easily accessible information to the contrary. The Takhar CME bias instrument demonstrated statistically significant bias in all the review articles. Biased statements that were nearly identical reappeared in the articles, including disease mongering, exaggerating rimonabant's efficacy and safety, lack of criticisms regarding rimonabant clinical trials, and speculations about surrogate markers stated as facts. Distinctive and identical misrepresentations regarding the endocannabinoid system also reappeared in articles by different authors.The findings are characteristic of bias that arises from financial conflicts of interest, and suggestive of ghostwriting by a common author. Resolutions for this scenario are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2043725967,"In archaea and eukarya, box C/D ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes are responsible for 2'-O-methylation of tRNAs and rRNAs. The archaeal box C/D small RNP complex requires a small RNA component (sRNA) possessing Watson-Crick complementarity to the target RNA along with three proteins: L7Ae, Nop5p, and fibrillarin. Transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the target RNA is performed by fibrillarin, which by itself has no affinity for the sRNA-target duplex. Instead, it is targeted to the site of methylation through association with Nop5p, which in turn binds to the L7Ae-sRNA complex. To understand how Nop5p serves as a bridge between the targeting and catalytic functions of the box C/D small RNP complex, we have employed alanine scanning to evaluate the interaction between the Pyrococcus horikoshii Nop5p domain and an L7Ae box C/D RNA complex. From these data, we were able to construct an isolated RNA-binding domain (Nop-RBD) that folds correctly as demonstrated by x-ray crystallography and binds to the L7Ae box C/D RNA complex with near wild type affinity. These data demonstrate that the Nop-RBD is an autonomously folding and functional module important for protein assembly in a number of complexes centered on the L7Ae-kinkturn RNP."
