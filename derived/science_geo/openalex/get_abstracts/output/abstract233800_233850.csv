https://openalex.org/W2143634733,"Recent aircraft and satellite laser altimeter surveys of the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica show that local glaciers are discharging about 250 cubic kilometers of ice per year to the ocean, almost 60% more than is accumulated within their catchment basins. This discharge is sufficient to raise sea level by more than 0.2 millimeters per year. Glacier thinning rates near the coast during 2002-2003 are much larger than those observed during the 1990s. Most of these glaciers flow into floating ice shelves over bedrock up to hundreds of meters deeper than previous estimates, providing exit routes for ice from further inland if ice-sheet collapse is under way."

https://openalex.org/W2122635542,"This study establishes that activation of p38 MAPK by UVB represents a crucial signal required for the conformational change and translocation of Bax to the mitochondria in human keratinocytes. UVB-induced Bax translocation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release, which precede caspase activation and other endpoints of the apoptotic program such as chromatin fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, are blocked by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the p38alpha MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK strongly reduces the UVB-induced formation of sunburn cells and blocks Bax conformational change both in cultured human keratinocytes and in human skin, providing clear evidence for the physiological role of the p38 MAPK-Bax pathway in the removal of precancerous, UVB-damaged keratinocytes. Furthermore, we show that Bcl-2 overexpression, but not the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, blocks Bax conformational change and its subsequent translocation downstream of p38 MAPK. These data indicate that the activation of p38 MAPK by UVB engages a caspase-independent death signal leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis in human keratinocytes and suggest that p38 MAPK might have a preventive role in the process of photocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2125838985,"All properties of molecules--from binding and excitation energies to their geometry--are determined by the highly correlated initial-state wavefunction of the electrons and nuclei. Details of these correlations can be revealed by studying the break-up of these systems into their constituents. The fragmentation might be initiated by the absorption of a single photon, by collision with a charged particle or by exposure to a strong laser pulse: if the interaction causing the excitation is sufficiently understood, the fragmentation process can then be used as a tool to investigate the bound initial state. The interaction and resulting fragment motions therefore pose formidable challenges to quantum theory. Here we report the coincident measurement of the momenta of both nuclei and both electrons from the single-photon-induced fragmentation of the deuterium molecule. The results reveal that the correlated motion of the electrons is strongly dependent on the inter-nuclear separation in the molecular ground state at the instant of photon absorption."

https://openalex.org/W2048551004,"High-latitude polar deserts are among the most extreme environments on Earth. Here we describe a large and previously unappreciated habitat for photosynthetic life under opaque rocks in the Arctic and Antarctic polar deserts. This habitat is created by the periglacial movement of the rocks, which allows some light to reach their underside. The productivity of this ecosystem is at least as great as that of above-ground biomass and potentially doubles previous productivity estimates for the polar desert ecozone."
https://openalex.org/W1986547423,"Oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) hybrid chains were purified from the notochord of hagfish. The chains (previously named CS-H for hagfish) have an average molecular mass of 18 kDa. Composition analysis using various chondroitinases demonstrated a variety of d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA)- and l-iduronic acid (IdoUA)-containing disaccharides variably sulfated with a higher proportion of GlcUA/IdoUA-GalNAc 4,6-O-disulfate, revealing complex CS/DS hybrid features. The hybrid chains showed neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of an axonic nature, which resembled the activity of squid cartilage CS-E and which was abolished fully by chondroitinase ABC digestion and partially by chondroitinase AC-I or B digestion, suggesting the involvement of both GlcUA and IdoUA in neuritogenic activity. Purified CS-H exhibited interactions in a BIAcore system with various heparin-binding proteins and neurotrophic factors (viz. fibroblast growth factor-2, -10, -16, and -18; midkine; pleiotrophin; heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor; vascular endothelial growth factor; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), most of which are expressed in the brain, although fibroblast growth factor-1 and ciliary neurotrophic factor showed no binding. Kinetic analysis revealed high affinity binding of these growth factors and, for the first time, of the neurotrophic factors. Competitive inhibition revealed the involvement of both IdoUA and GlcUA in the binding of these growth factors, suggesting the importance of the hybrid nature of CS-H for the efficient binding of these growth factors. These findings, together with those from the recent analysis of brain CS/DS chains from neonatal mouse and embryonic pig (Bao, X., Nishimura, S., Mikami, T., Yamada, S., Itoh, N., and Sugahara, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9765–9776), suggest physiological roles of the hybrid chains in the development of the brain.

Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) are also found ubiquitously in the extracellular matrices and at cell surfaces, being main components of cartilage and skin, respectively. CS consists of repeating disaccharide units of -4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAcβ1-, whereas DS is an isomeric form of CS and is formed from precursor CS through the action of glucuronyl C5 epimerase, thus consisting of disaccharide units of -4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAcβ1- and -4IdoUAα1–3GalNAcβ1- in varying proportions (2Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These disaccharide units are modified during chain elongation by specific sulfotransferases at C-2 of GlcUA/IdoUA and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc in various combinations, producing characteristic sulfation patterns critical for binding to various functional proteins displaying enormous structural diversity, comparable with that of HS, by embedding multiple overlapping functional sequences (3Sugahara K.

Growing evidence indicates the involvement of CS and DS in the signaling of various heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines (6Trowbridge J.M. Gallo R.L.

We and others have shown the importance of this class of molecule, from simple chondroitin involved in cell division of a nematode (9Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K.

Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). While pursuing the critical structural elements in the CS variants, we became aware of vital contributions of IdoUA to biological activities. Neuritogenic activities were shown for various IdoUA-rich oversulfated DS chains from marine animals (14Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and not only neuritogenic but also growth factor binding properties were revealed for the CS/DS hybrid chains attached to phosphacan/DSD-1-PG from neonatal mouse brains (14Hikino M.

Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), both of which contain an appreciable proportion of functional IdoUA. The neurite outgrowth-promoting activities of the CS/DS hybrid chains and oversulfated CS/DS chains are in contrast to the conventional concept that CS chains are intrinsic inhibitory components for axonal growth and path finding of various neurons (17Morgenstern D.A. Asher R.A. Fawcett J.W. Prog. Brain Res. 2002; 137: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 18Ichijo H. Connect. Tissue. 2003; 35: 11-17Google Scholar). The seemingly discrepant observations are most likely attributable to the structural changes during development as demonstrated for CS/DS hybrid chains of embryonic and adult pig brains (16Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Enzymatic removal of CS chains permits axonal regeneration after nigrostriatal tract axotomy and spinal cord injury (19Moon L.D. Asher R.A. Rhodes K.E. Fawcett J.W. Nat.

Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) and is therefore a promising clinical strategy. We are searching for CS, DS, or hybrid chains with neuritogenic activities that have potential for therapeutic applications to neuronal diseases and injuries. Here, we characterized GAGs from hagfish notochord, originally termed CS-H for hagfish (22Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Notochord is a connective tissue that supports the neural tube and that induces the formation of the central nervous system during the development of vertebrates. CS-H contains the characteristic oversulfated units IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) and IdoUA(2S)α1–3GalNAc(4S,6S), where 2S, 4S, and 6S represent sulfate at C-2, C-4, and C-6, respectively (22Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Ueoka C. Nadanaka S. Seno N. Khoo K.-H. Sugahara K. Glycoconj.

In view of the importance of the hybrid nature of the functional mammalian CS/DS chains in mouse (14Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Maeda N. He J. Yajima Y. Mikami T. Sugahara K. Yabe T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) brains, we searched for CS/DS hybrid chains in CS-H and demonstrated axonic neuritogenic and binding activities for a number of growth factors and a few major neurotrophic factors expressed in the brain. Materials—GAG lyases and unsaturated disaccharides derived from CS were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). HS from bovine intestinal mucosa was purchased from Sigma. Actinase E was from Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo). 2-Aminobenzamide (2-AB) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) and 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) were from Aldrich. Prepacked disposable PD-10 columns containing Sephadex G-25 (medium) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Tokyo). Sep-Pak Accell™ Plus QMA anion-exchange cartridges were from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). EZ-Link™ biotin-LC-hydrazide was obtained from Pierce. Recombinant human midkine (MK) expressed in Escherichia coli and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 (or acidic FGF) expressed in E. coli were from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, United Kingdom). Recombinant human FGF-2 (basic FGF) expressed in E. coli was from Genzyme TECHNE (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human pleiotrophin (PTN) expressed in E. coli and recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF165) expressed in insect cells were from RELIA Tech GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). Recombinant human heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) expressed in Sf21 insect cells, recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and recombinant human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were obtained from R&D Systems. Recombinant human FGF-10 expressed in E. coli was provided by Takashi Katsumata (Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Research Center, Osaka, Japan). Recombinant rat FGF-16 and recombinant mouse FGF-18 (24Danilenko D.M. Montestruque S. Philo J.S. Li T. Hill D. Speakman J. Bahru M. Zhang M. Konishi M. Itoh N. Chirica M. Delaney J. Hernday N. Martin F. Hara S. Talvenheimo J. Narhi L.O. Arakawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and recombinant rat ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (25Ohta K. Hara H. Hayashi K. Itoh N. Ohi T. Ohta M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Extraction and Purification of CS-H—CS-H was isolated from the notochord of hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri) as detailed previously (22Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, acetone-dried notochord was subjected to Pronase digestion. The proteins were removed by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid, and GAGs were precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol containing 2.5% calcium acetate and 0.25 m acetic acid. The GAG mixture was fractionated on a Dowex 1-Cl– column and eluted stepwise by increasing the NaCl concentration of the eluents. The fraction obtained by elution with 2.0 m NaCl was used for further characterization and subjected to treatment with freshly prepared nitrous acid (pH 1.5) according to the procedure of Shively and Conrad (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) to remove HS. After the treatment, nitrous acid was neutralized by addition of 0.5 m Na2CO3, and the resultant HS fragments were separated from CS-H by passing the treated sample through a Sephadex G-50 column (56 × 1 cm) with 50 mm pyridine acetate buffer (pH 5.0) as eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Finally, the CS-H preparation was freed of hydrophobic peptides by passing it through a C18 cartridge. Molecular Mass Determination—Molecular mass was determined using a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm) calibrated with known molecular mass markers, including dextran preparations (average molecular masses of 65.5, 37.5, and 18.1 kDa), HS from bovine intestinal mucosa (average molecular mass of 7.5 kDa), and heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (average molecular mass of 6 kDa) (27Yamada S. Okada Y. Ueno M. Iwata S. Deepa S.S. Nishimura S. Fujita M. Van Die I. Hirayabashi Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31877-31886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). V0 and Vt were determined using dextran (molecular mass of 170–200 kDa) and NaCl, respectively. Dextrans were monitored by the orcinol method for neutral sugars (28Bruckner J. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The purified CS-H preparation (13 μg as uronic acid) was loaded onto the column and eluted with 0.2 m ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min; the fractions were collected at 3-min intervals, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in 100 μl of water. An aliquot was taken for estimating GAG using DMMB according to the procedure of Chandrasekhar et al. (29Chandrasekhar S. Esterman M.A. Hoffman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), except that the absorbance was measured at 525 nm. Determination of the Digestibility of the Purified CS-H Preparation by Various Chondroitinases—The purified CS-H preparation (1.3 μg as uronic acid) was digested with 10 mIU of chondroitinase ABC (30Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5 mIU of chondroitinase AC-I (31Yamada S. Sugahara K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 213: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar), 5 mIU of chondroitinase AC-II, or 2 mIU of chondroitinase B (32Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After each enzymatic treatment, the digest was reconstituted in 20 or 50 μl of distilled water, and an aliquot was taken to estimate the resistant structure of CS-H by complexation with the metachromatic dye DMMB, which complexes with sulfated GAGs and long oligosaccharides, but not with short oligosaccharides. Briefly, 35 μl of 0.05 m acetate buffer (pH 6.8) and 200 μl of DMMB solution were added to a 5–10-μl aliquot of the above digest, and the absorbance was measured at 525 nm within 1 min (29Chandrasekhar S. Esterman M.A. Hoffman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The loss of reactivity toward the dye was checked after each digestion, and the amount remaining was calculated based on the absorbance value using the calibration curve obtained with varying amounts of standard commercial DS (0.2–1.0 μg) derived from porcine skin. The amount of GAG before digestion was taken as 100%. Neurite Outgrowth Promotion Assay—The neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of the purified CS-H preparation was assayed as reported previously (14Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the CS-H preparation (0.7 μg as uronic acid) or an equivalent amount of its digest with chondroitinase ABC, B, or AC-I diluted with phosphate-buffered saline was coated on plastic coverslips, which had been precoated with poly-dl-ornithine at 37 °C overnight. Hippocampal neuronal cells established from embryonic day 18 rat brain were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing N2 supplements (Invitrogen, Tokyo), 0.1 mm pyruvate, 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin, 0.29% l-glutamine, 0.2% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 5 mm HEPES. The cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h, after which the cells were fixed using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and the neurites were visualized by immunochemical staining using antibodies directed against microtubule-associated protein-2 and neurofilament. The immunostained cells on each coverslip were scanned and digitalized with a ×20 objective lens on an Olympus BX 51 optical microscope equipped with an Olympus HC-300Z/OL digital camera. The photographs were analyzed using morphological analysis software (Mac SCOPE, Mitany Corp., Tokyo). The length of the longest neurite, with at least one process chosen at random being longer than the cell body, was determined for 100 cells. At least three independent experiments per parameter or condition were carried out. Biotinylation of the Purified CS-H Preparation and HS—Purified CS-H or HS was dissolved in 100 mm MES (pH 5.5) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. To this solution were added 50 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide freshly dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and 0.5 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (Pierce) dissolved in MES. The mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature with continuous shaking. Excess biotinylating reagents were removed by dialysis in Spectrapor molecular porous membrane tubing (molecular mass cutoff of 3.5 kDa; Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Laguna Hills, CA) against several changes of phosphate-buffered saline. Immobilization of Purified CS-H and HS on a Sensor Chip—A streptavidin-coated sensor chip (BIAcore AB) was conditioned using 1 m NaCl and 50 mm NaOH for 1 min three times according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated CS-H or HS (3.3 μg as uronic acid) in phosphate-buffered saline was perfused and allowed to interact with the sensor's surface for 3 min in phosphate-buffered saline. Immobilization was confirmed by the increase in response units. Interaction Analysis—An interaction analysis was carried out in the BIAcore J system using the CS-H-immobilized sensor chip. Growth factors (200 ng each) were checked individually for binding to immobilized CS-H in running buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20). The flow rate was kept at a medium pace of 30 μl/min according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each growth factor was allowed to interact with immobilized CS-H for 3 min, which constituted the association phase. Dissociation of the growth factor, constituting the dissociation phase, was allowed to go on for an additional 2 min, after which the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 1 m NaCl for 2 min. Neurotrophic factors (100 ng each) were tested for binding to immobilized CS-H or HS at a high flow rate of 60 μl/min, and the time allowed for the association and dissociation phases was 3 and 2 min, respectively. To determine the kinetics of the binding of various growth factors to CS-H, each growth factor in varying concentrations was allowed to interact with immobilized CS-H. Kinetic parameters (ka, kd, and Kd) were determined by collectively fitting the overlaid sensorgrams locally using the 1:1 Languimuir binding model with mass transfer of the BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Interaction analyses of CS-H and HS with BDNF and GDNF for determination of kinetic parameters were carried out by global fitting of the sensorgrams obtained by employing high flow rates using the model mentioned above. High flow rates were used because of the high mass transfer effects observed at medium flow rates, due to which overlaid sensorgrams could not be fit with the 1:1 Languimuir binding model with mass transfer. Disaccharide Composition Analysis—A composition analysis of purified CS-H was carried out after digesting 0.5 μg (as uronic acid) with 10 mIU of chondroitinase ABC or 1.0 μg (as uronic acid) with 5 mIU of chondroitinase AC-I or 1 mIU of chondroitinase B for 1 h at 37 or 30°C (for chondroitinase B) as described above. The digested products were then derivatized with 2-AB (33Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Excess 2-AB was removed by repeated extraction with a 1:1 (v/v) water/chloroform mixture, and the water phase was dried. The residue was then reconstituted in 400 μl of 16 mm NaH2PO4 solution, and a 200-μl aliquot was analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA-03 column (33Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Analysis of the Chondroitinase Digests of the CS-H Preparation on a Superdex Peptide Column—The purified CS-H preparation (0.17 μg as uronic acid) was digested with chondroitinase ABC, AC-I, or B, and an equal amount was digested sequentially with chondroitinase B followed by chondroitinase AC-I as described above. The digests were individually labeled with the fluorophore 2-AB and processed as described above. Each digest was made up with 400 μl of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate containing 7% 1-propanol, and a 200-μl aliquot was analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column using the above-mentioned solvent as eluent at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Effects of Digestion of CS-H on Its Ability to Bind Growth Factors— The binding of various growth factors to immobilized CS-H was evaluated based on the ability of exogenously added CS-H or its digested products to competitively inhibit the binding. Purified CS-H (1.7 μg as uronic acid) was digested with chondroitinase ABC (10 mIU), AC-I (5.0 mIU), or B (2 mIU), and a 0.12-μg equivalent (as uronic acid) of each digest was dispensed into individual Eppendorf tubes and dried. Control tubes without CS-H were prepared in a similar way to normalize any nonspecific inhibition. Before injection, the tubes were reconstituted in running buffer and incubated with 50 ng of the growth factor to be tested for 10 min at room temperature. Injection was carried out for 3 min at a medium flow rate (30 μl/min), and the response during the association phase was compared with that exhibited by the growth factor only. Isolation and Purification of CS-H from Hagfish Notochord—In vertebrates, the notochordal primodium plays a central role in morphogenetic movement during gastrulation to induce the central nervous system. In cyclostomes, to which hagfish belong, the notochord is not atrophied during evolution and is available in a sufficient amount for preparing GAG chains, although PGs in notochord have not been well characterized in terms of the core proteins. CS-H from hagfish notochord was isolated as described (22Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, it was obtained by Pronase digestion of the acetone-dried notochord, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation for removal of proteins and ethanol precipitation of GAGs. It was then fractionated on a Dowex 1-Cl– column by stepwise elution at varying concentrations of NaCl. A unique predominant disaccharide unit (IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)), representing 68% of all disaccharides, was previously revealed in the major fraction eluted at 3.0 m NaCl from a Dowex column, in addition to the minor units IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(6S) and IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4S) (22Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and was named the H or iE unit (where “i” stands for iduronic acid) (7Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In this study, the 2 m NaCl-eluted fraction, representing ∼35% of total CS-H, was characterized as having less sulfated CS/DS hybrid chains. Because the preparation showed trace amounts of HS disaccharides upon HPLC analysis after heparitinase digestion (data not shown), it was purified further by subjecting it to nitrous acid treatment (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) to remove HS. Peptides were removed by passing through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge with water as eluent. The purified final preparation gave a single band between pig skin CS-B and shark cartilage CS-C upon electrophoresis on a cellulose acetate membrane (data not shown), which disappeared completely after digestion with chondroitinase ABC, but only partially after digestion with chondroitinase AC-I or B, suggesting the presence of both CS and DS chains or CS/DS hybrid chains in the CS-H preparation. Determination of the Molecular Mass of CS-H—The molecular size of purified CS-H was determined by gel filtration HPLC using a calibrated Superdex 200 column (27Yamada S. Okada Y. Ueno M. Iwata S.

The CS-H preparation eluted as a single fairly symmetrical peak when monitored using the dye DMMB (Fig. 1), giving an average molecular mass of ∼18 kDa. This is similar to the molecular masses of porcine skin DS (19 kDa) and porcine intestine DS (21 kDa), but slightly larger than the molecular mass of DS from eel skin (14 kDa) (34Sakai S. Kim W.S.

Most of the vibrational energy from the nanodroplet was transferred to the polar AOT head group within 1.8 picoseconds and then out to the CCl 4 within 10 picoseconds. Vibrational energy pumped directly into the AOT tail resulted in a slower 20- to 40-picosecond transfer of energy to the CCl 4 ."

Recently, Nrf3, a new member of the Nrf family with substantial homology to Nrf2, was identified and cloned. In this report, we have investigated the role of Nrf3 in ARE-mediated gene expression and induction of NQO1 in response to antioxidants. Overexpression of Nrf3 in Hep-G2 cells led to a concentration-dependent decrease in transfected and endogenous NQO1 gene expression and induction in response to antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ). Deletion mutation analysis revealed that Nrf3 repression of NQO1 gene expression required heterodimerization and DNA binding domains but not transcriptional activation domain of Nrf3. Bandshift and supershift assays with in vitro transcribed and translated proteins and nuclear extracts from Hep-G2 cells treated with Me2SO and t-BHQ and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Nrf3 associates with small Maf proteins to bind to the ARE. RNA interference specific to Nrf3 reduced intracellular Nrf3 leading to increased expression and induction of transfected and endogenous NQO1 gene expression in response to t-BHQ.

Exposure of cells to xenobiotics, drugs, and ionizing radiation is known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Nrf2, NF-E2 related factor 2; Nrf3, NF-E2 related factor 3; ARE, antioxidant-response element; NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1; t-BHQ, tert-butylhydroquinone; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; γ-GCS, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. and electrophiles that lead to oxidative and electrophilic stress and has a profound impact on the survival of all living organisms (1Breimer L.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The cells respond to oxidative/electrophilic stress. The initial effects are the activation of defense mechanisms that lead to coordinated activation of a battery of defensive genes that protect cells against oxidative/electrophilic stress (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 273: 273-286Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is because of these mechanisms that most of the cells neutralize the effects of the oxidative/electrophilic stress and survive. However, accumulation of ROS and electrophiles under adverse conditions are known to cause membrane and DNA damage, mutagenicity, degeneration of tissues, premature aging, apoptotic cell death, cellular transformation, and cancer (7Ward J.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 8Last J.A. Sun W.M. Witschi H. Environ.

Therefore, the protection mechanisms are vital for cell growth, differentiation, survival, and chemoprevention. It is interesting to note that antioxidants also undergo metabolic activation to generate the initial effect of oxidative/electrophilic stress leading to coordinated activation of a similar battery of genes as induced in response to xenobiotics, drugs, and ionizing radiations (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Therefore, antioxidants have been commonly used in experiments to determine the mechanism of coordinated activation of defensive genes and protection against oxidative and electrophilic stress (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The battery of defensive genes activated in response to oxidative/electrophilic stress includes NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1), NRH:quinone oxidoreductase2 (NQO2), glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit (GST Ya subunit), heme oxygenase-1, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) better known as glutamate-cysteine ligase. NQO1 is a flavoprotein that catalyzes metabolic reductive detoxification of redox cycling quinones (11Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8413-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GST Ya catalyzes conjugation of hydrophobic electrophiles and ROS with glutathione leading to their excretion (12Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 743-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 13Tsuchida S. Sato K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 337-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase-1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in heme catabolism (14Choi A.M. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). γ-GCS plays a key role in the regulation of glutathione metabolism (15Mulkahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). It may be noteworthy that disruption of the NQO1 gene in mice leads to oxidative stress, myelogenous hyperplasia, and increased sensitivity to chemical carcinogenesis (16Radjendirane V. Joseph P.

Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Antioxidant-response element (ARE) and nuclear NF-E2 related factors (Nrf1 and Nrf2) are known to mediate the basal expression and induction of a battery of defensive genes in response to antioxidants (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 273: 273-286Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Among these, Nrf2 is more potent than Nrf1 in inducing the gene expression. The NF-E2-related factors belong to the family of basic leucine zipper proteins. The basic region, just upstream of the leucine zipper region, is responsible for DNA binding. The acidic region is required for transcriptional activation. The mechanism of signal transduction from antioxidants to Nrf2 is the current subject of extensive research. The studies have shown that Nrf2 is retained in the cytosol by a cytosolic inhibitor INrf2/Keap1 (20Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 21Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). The signals from antioxidants lead to phosphorylation of Nrf2 and/or redox modulation of INrf2 (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 273: 273-286Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This results in separation of Nrf2 from INrf2. The Nrf2 accumulates in the nucleus leading to its binding to ARE and activation of ARE-mediated gene expression. A third family member of the NF-E2 related factors, Nrf3 with substantial homology to Nrf2, was cloned and sequenced (22Kobayashi A. Ito E. Toki T. Kogame K. Takahashi S. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6443-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the role of Nrf3 in ARE-mediated gene expression and induction in response to antioxidants remains unknown. More recently, Nrf3-null mice deficient in Nrf3 protein were generated (23Derjuga A. Gourley T.S. Holm T.M. Heng H.H.Q. Shivdasani R.A. Ahmed R. Andrews N.C. Blank V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nrf3-null mice developed normally and revealed no obvious phenotypic differences compared with wild type animals. Nrf3-null mice were fertile, and gross anatomy as well as behavior appeared normal. This led to the hypothesis that the role of Nrf3 in vivo may become apparent only after appropriate challenge to the mice. In this report, we investigate the role of Nrf3 in ARE-mediated expression and induction of the gene encoding chemopreventive protein NQO1. The overexpression of Nrf3 in cells led to repression of transfected and endogenous NQO1 gene expression. This repression required DNA binding but not transcriptional activation domain of Nrf3. Nrf3 associated with small Maf proteins binds to the NQO1 gene ARE. The RNAi-mediated inhibition of the intracellular level of Nrf3 resulted in an increase in basal expression of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene and induction in response to antioxidants. The data also demonstrate that overexpression of Nrf2 relieves Nrf3 repression of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression. These results suggest that Nrf3 is a negative regulator of ARE-mediated gene expression. Construction of Plasmids—The construction of pGL2-NQO1-ARE Luc was described previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We used forward 5′-CCATGGGATCCCCGTGGGAGATGAAGCTCCCGAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGCTTGGTACCTGGACAGTTTGTGATGCTGGTCAC-3′ primers in a PCR to amplify full-length Nrf3 cDNA from mouse Nrf3 cDNA clone purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). The PCR-amplified product was subcloned at a T/A cloning site in vector pcDNA (Invitrogen) to generate expression plasmid pcDNA-Nrf3. After transfection in Hep-G2 cells, this plasmid produced 90 kDa (825 amino acids) of protein. The forward primer as described above and the V5 reverse primer 5′-AAGCTTGGTACCGTTTCTTCTCTCTCTCTTTCCCTT-3′ were used in a related PCR to amplify Nrf3 that was subcloned in pcDNA to produce expression plasmid pcDNA-Nrf3-V5. The V5 reverse primer did not contain the Nrf3 translation termination codon. This allowed the translation to continue to add V5 tag to the Nrf3 from the vector. The V5 epitope contains 14 amino acids in the sequence Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn-Pro-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser-Thr. V5 tagging of Nrf3 protein allowed us to detect Nrf3 in Western blots and band/supershift assays. Good Nrf3 antibodies are unavailable at this time, whereas very good V5 antibodies are available from Invitrogen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The expression plasmid pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 was sequenced to confirm the continuous reading frame of Nrf3 with V5. The pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 upon transfection in Hep-G2 cells produced V5-tagged Nrf3 that was easily detected by Western analysis and probing with V5 antibody. The wild type pcDNA-Nrf3 was used as a template to generate Nrf3 mutants expressing either a 266-amino acid C-terminal region containing Cap'N′Collar and basic and leucine zipper domains or a 561-amino acid N-terminal region containing hydrophobic and transcriptional activation domains. The forward primer 5′-GACCATGGTCCGTATGCCTGTTGACTCT-3′ and V5 reverse primers as described above were used to amplify the region between nucleotides +1699 and +2128 that was subcloned in pcDNA to generate mutant plasmid pcDNA-Nrf3Δ1-V5. This plasmid was confirmed by sequencing, and upon transfection in Hep-G2, cells produced a C-terminal 266-amino acid Nrf3 protein tagged with V5. Similarly, the forward primer as described above to amplify full-length Nrf3 cDNA and the reverse primer 5′-GACTCGAGAGTGACAATTTCATCTACAGAAAAGGG-3′ were used in a PCR to amplify the region between nucleotides –4 and +1698 of Nrf3 cDNA to generate an N-terminal mutant lacking the C-terminal domain. The amplified product was subcloned in pcDNA in-frame with V5 to generate the expression plasmid pcDNA-Nrf3Δ2. This plasmid was also confirmed by sequencing, and upon transfection in Hep-G2, cells produced a 561-amino acid N-terminal region of Nrf3 protein containing the transcriptional activation domain. The forward 5′-AAGCTTCCATGGGCCGTGTTATGACGACCCCCAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCATGCTCTAGAACACTCGCTTCACTAAGAGCC-3′ primers and PCR were used to amplify MafG cDNA from plasmid LNCX-MafG (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The amplified product was subcloned in pcDNA to produce pcDNA-MafG. Cell Culture, Co-transfection of Expression Plasmids, and Reporter Assays—Human hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed in cells grown to ∼50% confluence in 6-well plates, using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described in the manufacture's protocol. 0.2 μg of reporter constructs of NQO1 ARE-Luc, GST Ya ARE-Luc, or γGCS ARE-Luc was co-transfected with expression plasmid pcDNA bearing wild type Nrf3 or Nrf3-V5, Nrf3Δ1-V5, and Nrf3Δ2-V5. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant at 2 μg/well by the addition of pcDNA3 control vector to the DNA mixture. The cells were incubated for 24 h after transfection and induced with 50 μmt-BHQ in carrier Me2SO, and cells were lysed 12 h later. One hundred micrograms of the lysates from transfected cells were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted. Western blots were probed with V5 and β-actin antibodies to determine overexpression of Nrf3-V5, Nrf3Δ1-V5, and Nrf3Δ2-V5. The lysates were also analyzed for luciferase activities using the dual luciferase assay system from Promega (Madison, WI). In related experiments, cytosolic fractions were prepared from transfected cells and analyzed for NQO1 protein (Western) and activity by procedures described previously (25Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44675-44682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control. Each set of experiment was repeated in triplicate. In related experiments, pcDNA-Nrf3 was co-transfected with pcDNA-Nrf2 to determine whether overexpression of Nrf2 relieves the Nrf3 repression of NQO1 ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression. Bandshift and Supershift Assay—Bandshift and supershift assays were performed for Nrf3 and MafG binding to the NQO1 gene ARE. Wild type Nrf3-V5, Nrf3Δ1-V5, Nrf3Δ2-V5, MafG, and Nrf2 were transcribed and translated in vitro by using TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the plasmids were individually added to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing T7 polymerase and [35S]methionine in a reaction volume of 50 μl at 30 °C for 90 min. The translation products were verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Bandshift and supershift assays with proteins translated in vitro were performed by procedures as reported previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and are described below for the Hep-G2 nuclear extract. In vitro translated wild type and mutant Nrf3-V5 proteins were incubated with MafG translated in vitro for 30 min at 30 °C for heterodimerization, and bandshift reactions were carried out with 32P-labeled ARE. Hep-G2 cells were plated in 150-mm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA or pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 per dish and treated with Me2SO and 50 μmt-BHQ for 12 h by procedures described previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from Me2SO- and t-BHQ-treated Hep-G2 cells were prepared as described previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of nuclear extracts from Hep-G2 cells transfected with pcDNA and pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-V5 antibody to visualize the Nrf3-V5 protein expression. Human NQO1 ARE synthetic probes, as described previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), were annealed and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Five micrograms of nuclear extract was incubated at room temperature in a reaction solution containing 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). After 15 min, the 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide (50,000 cpm/reaction) was added to the 20-μl reaction mixture and incubated for another 30 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, a 100–200-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was included in the preincubation mixture at 25 °C before the addition of the labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C at 120 V for 4 h. The gel was dried, and the complexes were revealed by autoradiography. For supershift assay, the total reaction mixture was preincubated with 1 μl of anti-V-5 antibody (0.2 mg/ml) from Invitrogen on ice for 30 min before bandshift analysis. Preimmune serum was incubated with the nuclear extracts for nonspecific interaction with IgGs. Immunoprecipitation—Hep-G2 cells were grown in 150-mm dishes. The cells were transfected with pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 and scraped into 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation. Nuclei were prepared as described previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The pelleted nuclei were lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μm okadaic acid). Five micrograms of nuclear extract was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Nrf3-V5 was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extract with 2 μl of V5 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology by procedures as described (25Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44675-44682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In related experiments, the nuclear lysate was also immunoprecipitated with MafG antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Preimmune serum was used as control for the immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of precipitate were run on SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were performed with antibodies specific to MafG or V5. Nrf3 RNA Interference (RNAi) Assay—Mouse hepatoma (Hepa-1) cells were grown as monolayer cultures in 6-well plates at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (40 units/ml), and streptomycin (40 μg/ml). RNAi-mediated mouse Nrf3 gene silencing was employed using pre-designed siRNA with sense 5′-ggAgAACgggAUgCUAAgATT-3′ and antisense 5′-UCUUAgCAUCCCgUUCUCCTg-3′ oligonucleotides from Ambion-RNA (Austin, TX). The Hepa-1 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with different amounts of pre-designed mouse Nrf3 siRNA without and with Nrf3-V5 and NQO1 ARE-Luc by procedures as described previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Whole cell extract was prepared in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Two mg of protein in supernatant from whole cell lysate was concentrated using 30YM Centricon tubes for 5 h at 2000 rpm at 4 °C. The siRNA-mediated Nrf3 knockdown efficiency was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 50 μg of whole cell extract and Western blotting with V-5 antibodies from Invitrogen. The cell lysates were also analyzed for luciferase activity by described procedures (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In related experiments, Hepa-1 cells were transfected with RNAi alone, and 100 μg of cytosolic protein was analyzed for NQO1 protein (Western blot) and activity by methods described previously (25Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44675-44682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the human NQO1 gene ARE and mutant AREs are shown (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of Nrf3 led to concentration-dependent repression of NQO1 ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression and induction in response to antioxidant t-BHQ in transfected cells (Fig. 1B). The transfection of Hep-G2 cells with 1.0 μg of pcDNA-Nrf3 resulted in a higher than 2-fold repression of luciferase gene expression (p > 0.001) and similar repression of induction in response to t-BHQ (p > 0.001). The mutations in the 3′-AP1 or GC box or 5′AP1-like element of ARE significantly reduced the expression and t-BHQ induction and Nrf3 repression of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression and induction (Fig. 1, C–E). The replacement of pcDNA-Nrf3 with pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 showed similar results as pcDNA-Nrf3 (Fig. 1F). The Nrf3-V5 showed similar pattern and magnitude of repression of ARE-mediated luciferase expression, as observed with Nrf3. Western blot analysis also revealed that the transfection of 0.1–2.0 μg of pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 in Hep-G2 resulted in a plasmid concentration-dependent increase in Nrf3-V5 protein (Fig. 1G). These results indicated that tagging of Nrf3 with V5 had no effect on the stability or function of Nrf3. Similar results were also observed with GST Ya ARE and γ-GCS ARE (data not shown). However, the magnitude of Nrf3 repression of GST Ya and γ-GCS ARE was lower than the NQO1 gene ARE. The overexpression of Nrf3 and Nrf3-V5 in Hep-G2 cells also repressed endogenous NQO1 protein and activity (Fig. 2). This repression was also Nrf3 and Nrf3-V5 concentration-dependent.Fig. 2Effect of overexpression of Nrf3 on endogenous NQO1 gene expression. Hep-G2 cells were transfected with the indicated concentrations of pcDNA-Nrf3 and pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 in separate experiments. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 m sucrose. The cytosol was prepared by standard procedures. A and B, Western analysis. One hundred micrograms of cytosolic proteins from each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western blots were first probed with NQO1 polyclonal antibody followed by washing and probing with β-actin antibody. C and D, NQO1 activity. The cytosolic fractions were analyzed for NQO1 activity by procedures as described previously (25Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44675-44682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transfection of pcDNA-Nrf3-V5, pcDNA-Nrf3Δ1-V5, and pcDNA-Nrf3Δ2-V5 in Hep-G2 cells resulted in a plasmid concentration-dependent increase in expression of Nrf3-V5, Nrf3Δ1-V5, and Nrf3Δ2-V5, respectively (Fig. 3). The overexpression of Nrf3-V5 in Hep-G2 cells resulted in an Nrf3-V5 concentration-dependent decrease in NQO1 ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression (Fig. 3). This was same as observed earlier (Fig. 1). The deletion of the N-terminal region containing transcriptional activation domain from Nrf3-V5 did not affect the capacity of Nrf3 to repress ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression (Fig. 3). However, deletion of the C-terminal region containing heterodimerization and DNA binding domains of Nrf3-V5 resulted in the loss of Nrf3 repression of ARE-mediated gene expression (Fig. 3). The wild type Nrf3-V5, Nrf3Δ1-V5, Nrf3Δ2-V5, MafG, and Nrf2 were successfully transcribed and translated in vitro from their respective pcDNA expression plasmids (Fig. 4A). Bandshift analysis with proteins translated in vitro showed that Nrf3-V5 alone failed to bind to ARE (Fig. 4B). Nrf3-V5 required MafG for binding to the ARE. The Nrf3-V5-MafG binding increased with increasing Nrf3 concentration in bandshift assays (Fig. 4B). Nrf3-V5-MafG binding was competed with cold ARE but not with mutant ARE (Fig. 4B). The origin of the unspecific band shown in Fig. 4B with ** remains unknown. This band is presumably due to unspecific interaction of rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein to the ARE and has also been observed previously (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Anti-V5 and not preimmune serum supershifted the Nrf3-V5-MafG band in supershift assays (Fig. 4B). The replacement of wild Nrf3-V5 with Nrf3Δ1-V5 lacking the transcriptional activation domain of Nrf3 showed similar results as observed with wild type Nrf3-V5 (Fig. 4C). However, the band shifted with Nrf3Δ1-V5-MafG moved faster than Nrf3-V5-MafG presumably because of truncated Nrf3-V5 (compare Fig. 4, B with C). Nrf3Δ1-V5-MafG band was competed with cold ARE but not with mutant ARE. The replacement of wild type Nrf3-V5 with Nrf3Δ2-V5 lacking the heterodimerization and DNA binding domains of Nrf3 failed to bind to the NQO1 gene ARE by itself or in association with MafG (Fig. 4D). In similar experiments Nrf2 alone or in combination with Nrf3 also failed to bind to ARE (Fig. 4E). The transfection of Hep-G2 cells with pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 resulted in overexpression of cDNA-derived Nrf3-V5 in transfected cells (Fig. 5A). The results of the bandshift and supershift assays with the NQO1 gene ARE and nuclear extracts from Hep-G2 cells transfected with pcDNA and pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 and treated with Me2SO and t-BHQ are shown in Fig. 5B. Two distinct complexes of nuclear proteins bound to NQO1 gene ARE from Hep-G2 cells treated with Me2SO and t-BHQ in all cases. However, t-BHQ treatment appeared to increase binding of both the complexes to the ARE. An anti-V5 antibody showed a supershifted band in the case of t-BHQ-treated nuclear extracts. The supershifted band in the case of Me2SO was hardly visible presumably because of a lower amount of shifted band. The nuclear extracts from untreated Hep-G2 cells transfected with Nrf3-V5 were immunoprecipitated with either MafG or V5 antibodies and analyzed on SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 6, A and B). The results demonstrate that Nrf3-V5 was immunoprecipitated along with MafG with MafG antibody (Fig. 6A). Similarly, MafG was immunoprecipitated along with Nrf3-V5 with V5-antibody (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Immunoprecipitation and Western analysis. The nuclear extracts from t-BHQ-treated Hep-G2 cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either preimmune serum (A and B) or with MafG (A) or with V5 (B) antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Western blot in A was probed with V5 antibody and in B with MafG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western analysis revealed that co-transfection of Nrf3 RNAi and pcDNA-Nrf3-V5 in Hepa-1 cells resulted in inhibition of intracellular concentration of Nrf3-V5 (Fig. 7A). This inhibition was Nrf3 RNAi concentration-dependent. The decrease in RNAi-induced Nrf3 level in Hep-G2 cells led to the derepression of NQO1 ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression (Fig. 7B). The derepression was also Nrf3 RNAi concentration-dependent. Most interestingly, the derepression of ARE-mediated gene expression and induction in response to t-BHQ in the case of cells transfected with 100 and 150 nm RNAi was significantly higher than the expression and induction in cells transfected with NQO1 ARE-Luc alone (p > 0.01 with 100 nm RNAi and p > 0.001 with 150 nm RNAi). The transfection of Hepa-1 cells with Nrf3-specific RNAi also activated endogenous NQO1 gene expression leading to an increase in NQO1 protein (Fig. 8A) and NQO1 activity (Fig. 8B). The increase in NQO1 was Nrf3 RNAi concentration-dependent.Fig. 8Effect of RNAi inhibition of Nrf3 on endogenous NQO1 gene expression. Hepa-1 cells were transfected with Nrf3 RNAi in concentrations as shown. The cells were lysed and analyzed for NQO1 protein by Western (A) and NQO1 activity (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overexpression of Nrf2 with Nrf3-V5 relieved the Nrf3 repression of ARE-mediated gene expression (Fig. 9). Most interestingly, the increase in NQO1 ARE-mediated gene expression with 0.2 μg of Nrf2 was significantly higher than the base line of expression (p > 0.001; Fig. 9, compare 5th lane with 1st lane). In a related experiment, Nrf2 alone increased ARE-mediated gene expression to a similar extent as did Nrf2+Nrf3-V5. In other words, Nrf3-V5 was ineffective in the repression of ARE-mediated gene expression in cells overexpressing Nrf2. Nrf1 and Nrf2-mediated gene expression and induction in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics are mechanisms of critical importance in chemoprevention (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 378: 221-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Nrf2 activation of ARE-mediated gene expression is a matter of extensive research. Both Nrf2 and Nrf1 do not bind to the ARE as homodimers or heterodimers with each other and require other leucine zipper proteins to form heterodimers that bind to the ARE (26Chan J.Y. Han X. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 27Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jun and small Maf proteins have been reported to heterodimerize with Nrf2 and bind to the ARE (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol.

In contrast, the role of Nrf2-small Maf heterodimers in ARE-mediated gene expression remains controversial (24Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The role of Nrf2-small Maf has been shown in activation and repression of gene expression. Nrf3 is the third member of the Nrf gene family (22Kobayashi A. Ito E. Toki T. Kogame K. Takahashi S. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6443-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Nrf3 has substantial homology to Nrf2 and Nrf1. The protein domains including transcriptional activation, Cap'N′Collar, DNA binding, and leucine zipper of Nrf2 and Nrf1 are conserved in Nrf3. Therefore, Nrf3 was expected to bind to ARE and alter ARE-mediated gene expression. The present studies demonstrate that Nrf3, like Nrf1 and Nrf2, did not bind to the ARE by itself. Nrf3 required small Maf proteins to bind to the ARE. This is also in agreement with a previous report showing the binding of Nrf3-small Maf to MARE (22Kobayashi A. Ito E. Toki T. Kogame K. Takahashi S. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6443-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Nrf3 in transfected cells repressed NQO1 gene expression and induction in response to antioxidants. This was observed with transfected ARE-luciferase gene construct and measurement of endogenous NQO1 gene expression. This was also supported by increased expression of the transfected and endogenous NQO1 gene in cells transfected with Nrf3 RNAi. The Nrf3-mediated repression of the NQO1 gene was dependent on the intact ARE sequence and required heterodimerization/DNA binding but not transcriptional activation domain of Nrf3. Several observations revealed that Nrf3 repression contributes to the maintenance of basal expression of endogenous and transfected NQO1 gene. The cells transfected with Nrf3 RNAi showed lower levels of Nrf3 and higher basal expression of the NQO1 gene. Similar results were also observed with Nrf3 RNAi and NQO1 ARE-luciferase gene expression. In addition, the cells expressing RNAi-mediated reduced levels of Nrf3 showed significantly higher induction in response to antioxidants of NQO1 gene expression, as compared with wild type cells expressing normal level of Nrf3. The studies also raise interesting questions regarding the mechanism of Nrf3 repression of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression. The two observations in this report suggest that Nrf3 might interfere with the binding of the potent activator Nrf2 to the ARE leading to repression of gene expression and induction. Nrf3 heterodimerization/DNA binding domain is equally effective as full-length Nrf3 in binding to ARE and repression of ARE-mediated gene expression. Overexpression of Nrf2 relives Nrf3 repression of ARE-mediated gene expression. Alternatively, it is possible that Nrf3 inhibits transcription by dimerization with activators of ARE. Further studies are required to understand the mechanism of Nrf3 repression of ARE-mediated gene expression. Recently, the transcription factors c-Jun-c-Fos, MafG-MafG, MafK-MafK, c-Maf-MafG, and Nrf2-MafG and more recently Bach1-small Maf have been shown to bind to ARE and negatively regulate ARE-mediated gene expression (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This is presumably to rapidly bring down the induced enzymes to their normal level and maintain it at a normal level. The negative regulation is required because it is always necessary to have a small amount of ROS and other free radicals present to keep the cellular defenses active. Because activation of defensive/chemopreventive proteins leads to significant reduction in the levels of superoxide and other free radicals, the cell may require negative regulatory factors like the small Mafs and c-Fos to keep the expression of defensive proteins “in check.” Nrf3-MafG in the present report is a new addition to the growing list of factors that contribute to negative regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression. In summary, the results in this report demonstrate that Nrf3 in association with small Maf proteins binds to the ARE and represses ARE-mediated gene expression. This repression requires heterodimerization/DNA binding domains of Nrf3 but not transcriptional activation domain of Nrf3. The negative regulation by Nrf3 might be one of several factors that control the rapid recovery of ARE-mediated gene expression to a normal level and maintain it at a normal level. We thank our colleagues for helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. S. Dhakshinamoorthy for the subcloning of Nrf3 in pcDNA vector."

The study has also provided a complete map of the C1 metabolism pathways in this methanotroph and clarified the interrelationships between them. Methanotrophs are a unique group of Gram-negative bacteria that grow aerobically on methane and utilize methane as the sole source of carbon and energy. There has been considerable interest in methanotrophs over the past 30 years, since they can be used to produce single-cell bulk chemicals such as propylene oxide. The ability of these bacteria to co-oxidize a wide range of alkanes, alkenes, and substituted aliphatic compounds has been exploited in bioremediation processes, for example, in the degradation of key pollutants such as trichloroethylene in soil and groundwater. Methanotrophs also play an important role in the global methane cycle (1Hanson R.S. Hanson T.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 439-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trotsenko Y.A. Ivanova E.G. Doronina N.V. Mikrobiologiya. 2001; 70: 725-736Google Scholar). Methanotrophs are classified into three distinct types. Type I methanotrophs show disk-like intracellular membranes and use the RuMP (ribulose 5-phosphate) pathway for carbon assimilation. In contrast, Type II methanotrophs possess intracellular membranes in the cell periphery and use the serine pathway to degrade the formaldehyde produced. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) is classified as a Type X methanotroph (1Hanson R.S. Hanson T.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 439-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since it shows the physiological properties of both Type I and II methanotrophs, but it develops Type I intracytoplasmic membranes.

All methanotrophs express a membrane-bound copper-containing particulate MMO (pMMO) (1Hanson R.S. Hanson T.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 439-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chan S.I. Chen K.H.-C. Yu S. S.-F. Chen C.-L. Kuo S. S.-J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4421-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), while Type X and a few Type II methanotrophic bacteria are capable of producing a second, soluble form (soluble methane monooxygenase, sMMO). Copper ions are known to switch the methane oxidation from sMMO to pMMO. At low copper-to-biomass ratios, the cytoplasmic sMMO is the dominant MMO. When the cells are grown at high copper-to-biomass ratios, pMMO is expressed and produced instead in the plasma membrane. Because of the unique role of copper ions in regulating the switch between sMMO and pMMO, we have applied cICAT (cleavable isotope coded affinity tag) in combination with off-line two-dimensional LC-MS/MS to quantitatively compare the expression levels of the unique enzymes involved in the featured metabolic pathways under different copper environments. The ICAT technology has been developed for quantitative analysis of proteomic changes in response to cellular perturbations with wide dynamic range and quantitation accuracy (4Gygi S.P. Rist B.

Two groups (the National High-Throughput Genome Sequencing Center at the National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan and the Institute for Genomic Research (Rockville, MD) (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/mdbinprogress.html)) have been independently making substantial progress toward completing the sequencing of the genome of this methanotroph. These data, although incomplete, have been indispensable to the present proteomic study. Sample Preparation and cICAT Labeling—The culturing and growth of M. capsulatus (Bath) and the separation of the cellular materials into cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were carried out following the procedure developed recently (7Yu S. S.-F. Chen K. H.-C. Tseng M. Y.-H. Wang Y.-S. Tseng C.-F. Chen Y.-J. Huang D.-S. Chan S.-I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5915-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Four fractions of proteins were obtained: two cytosolic fractions and two intracellular membrane fractions corresponding to the protein samples derived from cells grown in 0 and 30 μm copper. All samples were lyophilized for quantitation. Protein samples were prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/ml using the extraction buffer (0.3% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 5 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea) by weighing out samples of the lyophilized powder. The protein concentration was verified by Bio-Rad protein assay. Labeling of the proteins by the cICAT reagents and following procedures before MS analysis were carried out as described in the literature (8Yi E.C. Goodlett D. Current Protocol in Protein Science Online. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Edison, NJ2004Google Scholar). Peptide Separation and Purification—The peptides were separated by cation exchange chromatography using a 4.6 × 200-mm polysulfoethyl A column (5-μm particles, 300-A pore size; Poly LC, Columbia, MD) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 0-25% Buffer B over 30 min, followed by 25-100% Buffer B over 20 min (Buffer A: 5 mm K2HPO4, 25% CH3CN, pH = 3.0; Buffer B: 5 mm K2HPO4, 25% CH3CN, 350 mm KCl, pH = 3.0). The elution profile of the cation exchange chromatography determined which fractions were to be analyzed further, and each were individually processed over avidin cartridges (Applied Biosystems), and the affinity tags were cleaved according to the manufacturer's protocol (cICAT kit for protein labeling; Applied Biosystems) to isolate the labeled Cys-containing peptides for micro-capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (μLC-MS/MS) analysis. μLC-MS/MS Analysis—Samples were loaded using an auto-sampler and sequentially analyzed by μLC-MS/MS. Injections were made on a 1.5 cm × 100 μm trapping and 12 cm x 75 μm separation column packed in-house (Magic C18; Micromass BioResources, Auburn, CA). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5-40% Buffer B over 180 min at an elution rate of ∼200 nl/min (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in H2O; Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). A Hewlett Packard 1100 solvent delivery system with flow splitting (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) was used. An LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) with an in-house built microspray device was used for all analyses. Peptide fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation was carried out in an automated fashion using the dynamic-exclusion option, and the resultant MS/MS spectra were recorded. The interpretation of the MS/MS data were finally submitted to a suit of software tools for automated data base searching and statistical interpretation of the search results. Data Analysis and Bioinformatics—Genomic sequencing of M. capsulatus (Bath) was performed by the National High-Throughput Genome Sequencing Center at the National Yang-Ming University. The entire shotgun sequencing is not finished; however, we have obtained both the 4× and 8× coverage contigs. EMBOSS 2.8.0 (9Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6541) Google Scholar), NCBI BLAST 2.2.6 (10Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), and HMMER 2.3.2 (11Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar) were installed on FreeBSD 4.8 RELEASE with one Intel® Pentium® 4 processor operating in the batch mode. Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted and translated into protein sequences by the GETORF function of the EMBOSS suite, and their homologues protein names were searched against the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and the NCBI non-redundant data bases with the expectation value of 1E-05 as the criterion. 5485 protein homologues were predicted. Since the homologues of the ORFs were not exactly the ones that gave the best similarity (for example, some hypothetical proteins were predicted by genomic sequencing), all the entries were checked manually. Automated data base searching using SEQUEST (12Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. II I J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar) software was performed to identify peptide and protein sequence matches for each recorded MS/MS spectrum. Uninterrupted MS/MS spectra were searched against the M. capsulatus (Bath) genomic sequencing ORF data base. SEQUEST search parameters for light-cICAT-labeled cysteine were set to 277.13, with a +9 differential modification for heavy cICAT-labeled cysteine and +16 for oxidized methionine, mass tolerance 3 Da. Tryptic digested peptides were specified to limit the search results. Identified peptide scores were validated by Peptide Prophet, and peptides that displayed Peptide Prophet scores >0.9 were further analyzed by Protein Prophet to validate identified open reading frames (13Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar, 14Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar). The light to heavy (L/H) ratios resulting from the differential exprssion were calculated and normalized by ASAPRatio (15Li X.J. Zhang H. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 6648-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (Automated Statistical Analysis on Protein Ratio) program. Additional function annotation was performed with the NCBI COGNITOR program on the web (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/), and each protein entry was placed into the highest scoring COG group (16Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Protein families were classified by HMMER with the Pfam HMM library. Protein domains were analyzed by the PATMATMOTIFS function of EMBOSS 2.8.0 with the PROSITE data base (17Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Le Saux V. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Bordoli L. Gattiker A. De Castro E. Bucher P. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D134-D137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein locations were predicted by the PSORT WWW server (18Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and the number of transmembrane domains was predicted by the TMAP function of EMBOSS 2.8.0 (19Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Choice of Copper Concentration for the Present Study—According to our recent study (7Yu S. S.-F. Chen K. H.-C. Tseng M. Y.-H. Wang Y.-S. Tseng C.-F. Chen Y.-J. Huang D.-S. Chan S.-I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5915-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), 30 μm is the optimal copper concentration for the growth and harvesting of cells of M. capsulatus (Bath). For the present study, the growth condition in the fermenter was controlled by a hollow-fiber membrane bioreactor (7Yu S. S.-F. Chen K. H.-C. Tseng M. Y.-H. Wang Y.-S. Tseng C.-F. Chen Y.-J. Huang D.-S. Chan S.-I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5915-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the cells were grown continuously at a copper ion concentration of 30 μm and kept in the mid-log phase so that a steady state was reached between the copper in the enzyme and the copper concentration in the growth medium. While the cells would grow at lower concentrations of copper ions, the pMMO in the membranes was not homogeneous and did not all contain the full complement of copper ions and exhibit the maximum specific activity. Higher concentrations of copper ions were not used as no additional copper ions would be taken up by the cells (7Yu S. S.-F. Chen K. H.-C. Tseng M. Y.-H. Wang Y.-S. Tseng C.-F. Chen Y.-J. Huang D.-S. Chan S.-I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5915-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 682 Proteins Revealed in Proteomic Study—Proteins expressed in the absence and presence of copper ion, 0 and 30 μm, were labeled with isotopically light (12C: L) and heavy (13C: H) cICAT reagents, respectively. In summary, a total of 682 proteins of M. capsulatus (Bath) were identified with at least one peptide of high confidence value: 429 were from the cytosolic fraction and 253 from the membrane fraction (Supplemental Table I). Moreover, it was possible to quantify the change in expression levels of 533 of the 682 identified proteins from the L/H mass ratios of the protein fragments. 87.8% of the identified proteins has significant sequence homology to known proteins in the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL data bases, including 59 entries (8.7% of the identified proteins) sequenced from M. capsulatus (Bath). The remaining 12.2% identified proteins show very low or no detectable homology to other proteins in the data base and are considered poorly characterized. They may represent unique proteins expressed in M. capsulatus (Bath) or gene products that have not been discovered previously. To obtain information regarding the subcellular localization of the 682 identified proteins, the identified ORFs were further analyzed by different algorithms. To predict outer and inner membrane proteins in M. capsulatus (Bath), the PSORT algorithm was used. Transmembrane domains (TMDs) were also predicted by the TMAP function of EMBOSS. The analysis showed that the identified proteins were mainly localized in the cytoplasm (412 soluble proteins). Of the 236 proteins predicted to be in the inner membrane fraction, 84 proteins (36%) were predicted to contain two or more transmembrane domains. The fraction of cytosolic proteins with two or more transmembrane domains was 8.7% (36 proteins), indicating that there was some contamination of the cytosolic pool with membrane proteins. The remaining 27 cytosolic proteins were periplasmic, and seven were Gram-negative outer membrane proteins. These results are summarized in Fig. 1. Aside from pMMO subunit C (see below), other proteins identified in the membrane fraction included the α, β, and γ subunits of ATP synthase (L/H = 1.27, 1.1, and 0.99, respectively), NADH dehydrogenase C (L/H = 1.09) and D, F, and G (L/H = 1.43) chains, the proton-translocating pyrophosphate synthase (15 TMDs), and the sodium bile acid symporter family protein (10 TMDs, L/H = 0.58). The cation-transporting ATPase (10 TMDs, L/H = 0.84), magnesium-transporting ATPase (E1 E2 family) (8 TMDs), CopF Cu-ATPase (8 TMDs, L/H = 0.66), the O-antigen acetylase (10 TMDs), and the hypothetical protein PA0575 (10 TMDs, L/H = 1.84) were also found, with a large number of transmembrane domains predicted. All unique protein sequences identified were analyzed by the functional annotation program NCBI COGnitor (Fig. 2). 170 proteins (25%), including all the sMMO and pMMO subunits (see below), could not be classified in this manner, because COG relies on sequenced genomes as the classification data base, and there has been no systematic research and genomic sequencing of methanotrophs until the present study. Although TIGR is sequencing the genome of M. capsulatus (Bath) independently, the data available from this source is too limited and inadequate for the large scale proteomic study undertaken here. Although the expression levels (L/H ratios) vary within 2-fold for 82% of the proteins in the present cICAT proteomic study, the composition of the remaining 18% proteins were found to be quite different (Fig. 3). It is clear from the nature of the proteins affected that the metabolism of the cell must be affected by copper ion concentration change. The entire metabolic structure remains the same, but the contributions of the various metabolic pathways are different. Proteins Stimulated at 30 μm Copper—Of the 60 proteins with L/H ratio smaller than 0.5, most of them could be classified as enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, cell wall, membrane, envelope biogenesis, coenzymes, metabolism, and inorganic ion transporters (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table IIa). Involved in the direct oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide are pMMO, tungsten-containing aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (L/H = 0.08), aldehyde dehydrogenase (L/H = 0.23), and tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (L/H = 0.23). pMMO (including its subunits PmoA, PmoB, and PmoC) is the most abundant protein produced at 30 μm copper as observed by SDS-PAGE (7Yu S. S.-F. Chen K. H.-C. Tseng M. Y.-H. Wang Y.-S. Tseng C.-F. Chen Y.-J. Huang D.-S. Chan S.-I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5915-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although cICAT relies on the chemical modification of cysteine for identification, the cysteine content in pMMO is very low. There is no cysteine residue in PmoB, only one in PmoA, and there are three in PmoC. Only the PmoC cysteine-containing C terminus peptide was detected (L/H = 0.09), and we were unsuccessful in observing other cysteine-containing pMMO proteolytic fragments from the transmembrane domains of PmoA and PmoC. The L/H ratio observed was 0.09, indicating that pMMO was overexpressed by about 11-fold at 30 μm copper relative to the level that was detected in the proteome derived from cells grown without added copper, as expected from earlier results (7Yu S. S.-F. Chen K. H.-C. Tseng M. Y.-H. Wang Y.-S. Tseng C.-F. Chen Y.-J. Huang D.-S. Chan S.-I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5915-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transmembrane domains are difficult to label by the cICAT reagent. In addition, the extraction and digestion of transmembrane peptides remains a technical challenge. The tungsten-containing aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (L/H = 0.08) was another protein that was strongly up-regulated by copper. Another strongly induced ORF was identified by BLAST searching as aldehyde dehydrogenase (L/H = 0.23), which is involved in substrate assimilation of a wide variety of aldehydes. The diversity of formaldehyde-related redox proteins may reflect the high amounts of formaldehyde produced at 30 μm copper from methane oxidation by pMMO, due to the high levels of pMMO in the membranes as well as the higher solubility of methane in the intracytoplasmic membranes. The tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (L/H = 0/23), the last enzyme in the pathway of methane oxidation, was also identified in the membrane fraction. Since formaldehyde is toxic to the cell, presumably, these enzymes are up-regulated to remove the formaldehyde efficiently. However, the metal content of these “tungsten” enzymes remains to be addressed. From the genome sequencing data available, we have located all the genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Seven of the enzymes, except succinyl-CoA dehydrogenase, were identified in the cICAT study. Succinyl-CoA synthetase β chain (L/H = 0.14) and α chain (L/H = 0.19) (another fragment on another contig was also identified, with a different L/H ratio of 0.43), fumarate hydratase (L/H = 0.31), dihydrolipoamide acetyltranferase (L/H = 0.42), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (the E1 component, L/H = 0.46) were stimulated at 30 μm copper. It has been reported that M. capsulatus (Bath) lacks a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle due to the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (20Anthony C. The Biochemistry of Methylotrophs. Academic Press Inc. Ltd., London1982: 296-379Google Scholar); however, the latter has been identified (L/H = 0.59). These results provide further evidence that Type X methylotrophs share some metabolic properties of both Type I and Type II bacteria. Type II methanotrophs use the serine pathway as its major C1 assimilation route with a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle, while Type I methanotrophs do not (1Hanson R.S. Hanson T.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 439-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Anthony C. The Biochemistry of Methylotrophs. Academic Press Inc. Ltd., London1982: 296-379Google Scholar). It is interesting that some cell wall and capsule synthesis related proteins such as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase (L/H = 0.45), UDP-2,3-diacyl-glucosamine hydrolase (L/H = 0.49), 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphospho-octonate aldolase (L/H = 0.19), UDP-glucose/GDP-mannose dehydrogenase (L/H = 0.27), and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (L/H = 0.44) are stimulated at the higher copper ion concentration. With the cell volume increasing to accommodate the intracytoplasmic membranes, it is possible that the synthesis of additional cell wall material is necessary. Methanotrophic bacteria with pMMO also have higher growth yields than those with sMMO (1Hanson R.S. Hanson T.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 439-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high copper environment is presumably more compatible with the survival of the M. capsulatus (Bath). Four ion transport proteins are also overexpressed. Three enzymes provide the coenzyme source for other proteins: porphobilinogen deaminase (L/H = 0.39), the fourth enzyme in porphyrin biosynthesis; 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (L/H = 0.43), the enzyme involved in the last step of riboflavin biosynthesis; and quinolinate synthetase (L/H = 0.36), which is involved in NAD biosynthesis. Hemerythrin (L/H = 0.26) was observed at 30 μm copper in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions. Hemerythrin is an iron-containing oxygen carrier typically found in marine organisms, but the bacterial fusion domain homologue is also known (21Xiong J. Kurtz Jr D.M. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5117-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A BLAST search showed that the hemerythrin domain is conserved. We have successfully purified this hemerythrin, and its UV-visible spectrum is identical to hemerythrins from other sources, indicating the presence of iron. 2W.-C. Kao and S. I. Chan, unpublished result. Interestingly, this is the first bacterial hemerythrin isolated. Since the level of expression of the hemerythrin is significantly enhanced at the higher copper concentration, we surmise that hemerythrin functions as oxygen carrier to transport the dioxygen efficiently throughout the cell body for consumption by the pMMO, particularly at the high levels of pMMO produced at 30 μm copper. Finally, at 30 μm copper, there are three protein sequences with no significant similarity in the current data base and six hypothetical proteins. The patterns matched by similarity search are summarized in Supplemental Table IIb. An ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) motif was found in MCB-2007_160 (predicted open reading frame name) (L/H = 0.39); and MCB-2065_178 (L/H = 0.23) possesses three amidation site motifs and one RGD (arginine, glycine, and aspartic acid) tripeptide pattern (cell attachment sequence). Although their exact functions are unclear, these proteins must be quite important, because their expressions are stimulated at the higher copper concentration. Proteins with Higher Expression Levels at 0 μm Copper—For comparison, we highlight here the proteins that were expressed at higher levels in the absence of copper. The 68 proteins with L/H ratio >2 appear to affect different parts of the cell physiology than the proteins with ratio <0.5. They tend to be proteins related to post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones and signal transduction mechanisms (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table IIIa). In fact, no enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolism were found except sMMO (MmoX, MmoY, MmoB, MmoC, with L/H = 7.23, 4.36, 42.96, and 14.6, respectively; MmoD was also identified, but its L/H ratio could not be determined) and glucokinase (L/H = 2.62). The former is responsible for the first step of methane oxidation and has already been well studied (22Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Since M. capsulatus (Bath) does not rely on hexose as the carbon source, and there are no reports supporting the ability of M. capsulatus (Bath) to grow on glucose, the function of glucokinase might be involved in glycogen biosynthesis or gluconeogenesis. Two of the four gene translations (MmoG, MmoS, MmoR, and MmoQ) in the sMMO cluster were also found. MmoG (L/H = 18.71) is a 60-kDa chaperonin homologue involved in the assembly of the sMMO complex, while MmoS (L/H = 0.84) is a histidine kinase hypothesized to function as a copper sensor (23Csáki R. Bodrossy L. Kelm J. Murrell J.C. Kovács K.L. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). No significant change was observed in the expression level of the histidine kinase. Some cell signaling and regulatory proteins were highly expressed when the cells were grown without added copper, including the transcriptional regulatory protein zraR (L/H = 3.23), sensory box protein (L/H = 2.44), LacZ expression regulator (L/H = 2.45), and the probable universal stress protein homologue (L/H = 2.42). Two proteins that control cell division were identified, including the cell division inhibitor MinD (L/H = 2.27) and the cell division protease ftsH (L/H = 4.02). Also observed was the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (L/H = 15.22) with its SelR domain, which repairs methionine sulfoxide damaged peptides by reducing them to form methionine in conjunction with reductants such as thioredoxin, thus protecting proteins against oxidative stress. Other redox proteins such as glutathione S-transferase (L/H = 2.75) involved in glutathione-dependent reactions and the seven-iron ferredoxin (L/H = 9.81) were also detected. Two molecular chaperone-related proteins responsible for folding-corrections were identified. Several key enzymes involved in metabolism were identified with enhanced abundances at 0 μm copper. The formylmethanofuran hydrolase (L/H = 2.18) is responsible for the conversion of formyl-H4MPT (tetrahydromethanopterin) to formic acid in the H4MPT pathway (24Pomper B.K. Saurel O. Milon A. Vorholt J.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). GTP cyclohydrolase I (L/H = 4.02) is involved in the first step of the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate, which is a C1 transfer intermediate found in bacteria, some archaea and eukaryotes (24Pomper B.K. Saurel O. Milon A. Vorholt J.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ATP phosphoribosyltransferase regulatory subunit (L/H = 8.67), imidazoleglycerol phosphate synthase subunit hisF1 (L/H = 2.81) and histidinol dehydrogenase (L/H = 19.95), are enzymes involved in the first, fifth, and the last steps of histidine biosynthesis, respectively. Both denitrification enzymes were observed: nitrate reductase (large subunit, L/H = 2.88; small subunit, L/H = 2.22) and nitrite reductase (L/H = 3.84). MCB-2060_183 (L/H = 2.15) was BLAST searched as the macrophage migration inhibitory factor found in various euk"
https://openalex.org/W2044509619,"The N139D mutant of cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides retains full steady state oxidase activity but completely lacks proton translocation coupled to turnover in reconstituted liposomes (Pawate, A. S., Morgan, J., Namslauer, A., Mills, D., Brzezinski, P., Ferguson-Miller, S., and Gennis, R. B. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 13417–13423). Here, time-resolved electron transfer and vectorial charge translocation in the ferryl-oxo → oxidized transition (transfer of the 4th electron in the catalytic cycle) have been studied with the N139D mutant using ruthenium(II)-tris-bipyridyl complex as a photoactive single-electron donor. With the wild type oxidase, the flash-induced generation of Δφ in the ferryl-oxo → oxidized transition begins with rapid vectorial electron transfer from CuA to heme a (τ ∼15 μs), followed by two protonic phases, referred to as the intermediate (0.4 ms) and slow electrogenic phases (1.5 ms). In the N139D mutant, only a single protonic phase (τ ∼0.6 ms) is observed, which was associated with electron transfer from heme a to the heme a3/CuB site and decelerates ∼4-fold in D2O. With the wild type oxidase, such a high H2O/D2O solvent isotope effect is characteristic of only the slow (1.5 ms) phase. Presumably, the 0.6-ms electrogenic phase in the N139D mutant reports proton transfer from the inner aqueous phase to Glu-286, replacing the “chemical” proton transferred from Glu-286 to the heme a3/CuB site. The transfer occurs through the D-channel, because it is observed also in the N139D/K362M double mutant in which the K-channel is blocked. It is concluded that the intermediate electrogenic phase observed in the wild type enzyme is missing in the N139D mutant and is because of translocation of the “pumped” proton from Glu-286 to the D-ring propionate of heme a3 or to release of this proton to the outer aqueous phase. Significantly, with the wild type oxidase, the protonic electrogenic phase associated with proton pumping (∼0.4 ms) precedes the electrogenic phase associated with the oxygen chemistry (∼1.5 ms).

The enzyme conducts electrons from cytochrome c to O2 and couples the energetically downhill electron transfer to the uphill electrogenic movement of protons across the membrane from the bacterial cytoplasm (or mitochondrial matrix) to the periplasm (or mitochondrial intermembrane space). The transmembrane charge separation by COX involves two different mechanisms. Half of the free energy (corresponding to the transmembrane translocation of four elementary electric charges per dioxygen reduced) is conserved by a direct mechanism; the four electrons and four protons required to convert O2 to water come from opposite sides of the membrane. This direct mechanism was postulated by Mitchell (5Mitchell P. Chemiosmotic Coupling and Energy Transduction. Glynn Research Ltd., Bodmin1968: 1-111Google Scholar, 6Mitchell P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the original chemiosmotic hypothesis. Charge separation via this mechanism is an intrinsic part of the reaction chemistry and cannot be dissociated from it without re-engineering the proton and/or electron delivery pathways to the active site. Any mutation resulting in inhibition of this electrogenic function would inevitably inhibit electron transfer activity of the enzyme. The other half of the free energy is conserved by virtue of “proton pumping” discovered by Wikström in 1977 (7Wikström M. Nature. 1977; 266: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and resulting in the transmembrane electrogenic translocation of four more protons per catalytic cycle. This proton pumping occurs by an “indirect” coupling mechanism and is not an obligatory part of the reaction chemistry. In principle, residues constituting the proton pump may be located in a separate part of the protein from the catalytic center, and the coupling can occur by virtue of finely tuned mechano-electrical interactions mediated by minor conformational changes of the protein (cf. Refs. 8Xavier A.V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532 (and references therein): 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 9Xavier A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658 (and references therein): 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The indirect coupling of the proton pump has been demonstrated recently by the isolation of cytochrome oxidase mutants that have full catalytic electron transfer activity but that do not pump protons. This was first shown for the N131D mutant of the COX from Paracoccus denitrificans (10Pfitzner U. Hoffmeier K. Harrenga A. Kannt A. Michel H. Bamberg E. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6756-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which places an aspartic acid residue near the entrance of the D-channel. This mutant COX has wild type oxidase activity but does not pump protons (10Pfitzner U. Hoffmeier K. Harrenga A. Kannt A. Michel H. Bamberg E. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6756-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is exactly the phenotype expected for cytochrome oxidase in which electron transfer is decoupled from proton translocation at the molecular level. The equivalent mutant of the COX from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, N139D, reveals a similar phenotype, i.e. loss of proton pumping, whereas the electron transfer activity is not only maintained but is enhanced about 2-fold (11Pawate A.S. Morgan J. Namslauer A. Mills D. Brzezinski P. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13417-13423Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this work the properties of the N139D mutant of the R. sphaeroides COX have been further examined by observing the time-resolved intraprotein electron transfer and electrogenic activity associated with the F → O transition, corresponding to the transfer of the fourth electron in the catalytic cycle. In the N139D mutant, the rapid initial electrogenic step (vectorial electron transfer CuA → heme a; τ ∼15 μs) is followed by a single protonic electrogenic phase with τ of ∼0.6 ms. The data strongly suggest that the 0.6-ms electrogenic phase is because of proton uptake through the D-channel, probably to re-protonate Glu-286, currently believed to be the internal donor of the “chemical” proton required at the active site for the catalytic chemistry of the F → O step (see Refs. 12Namslauer A.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 566 (and references therein): 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The N139D mutant is missing the “intermediate” electrogenic phase which thus can be tentatively identified as vectorial transfer of the “pumped” proton within the protein in the direction of the outer aqueous phase across part of the insulating barrier. All chemicals used were reagent or analytical grade. Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was obtained from Anatrace. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was obtained from Qiagen. D2O (98%) was purchased in St. Petersburg (Russia) from a local source. Experiments with D2O were done at the same pH meter reading (pHobs) as in H2O. Wild type and mutant cytochrome c oxidase, modified by a six-histidine affinity tag, was purified from R. sphaeroides by chromatography on a nickel column as described previously (16Mitchell D.M. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Purified cytochrome c oxidase was reconstituted in phospholipid (asolectin) vesicles by a cholate dialysis method (17Hinkle P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Photoexcitation of RuBpy—Ru(II)-tris-bipyridyl (RuBpy) was photoexcited by 9-ns light pulses (λ = 532 nm) from a neodymium YAG laser (Spectra Physics, model Lab-170-10) operated in a double frequency mode. The light pulse energy was 100–150 mJ for the electrometric measurements and about 300 mJ for absorption measurements. Time-resolved Absorption Measurements—Absorption transients were made by using a thermostatted (21 °C, if not stated otherwise) 4 × 4-mm rectangular quartz cell (Starna Cells) with four optically transparent windows. The total volume of the sample was 250 μl. The monitoring light from a 70-watt lamp was passed through a grating monochromator (Jobin-Yvon) and projected onto the cell in the sample holder at a right angle relative to the excitation laser beam (10 mm in diameter), passing through the entire sample volume (vertically downward). After the sample, the monitoring light was passed to the photomultiplier via a second grating monochromator and a dark-blue glass filter (OD540/OD450 >7.5) The photomultiplier signal was digitized using a PC-installed Gage 8012A card (2,000,000 points, 12-it, time resolution of 0.1 μs). An RC filter was placed before the analog-to-digital converter to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. 25–30 3–5-s spaced traces were averaged for each absorption trace. Time-resolved Measurements of Membrane Potential Generation— Time-resolved electrometric measurements of membrane potential generation by liposome-reconstituted COX were carried out as described previously (18Zaslavsky D.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4853-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using RuBpy as a photoactivated single-electron donor for cytochrome oxidase CuA (20Nilsson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The signal was digitized with the aid of the same PC-installed Gage 8012 card as used for the absorption measurements. The kinetic traces were resolved into individual exponents using the program Discrete (21Provencher S.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 27-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and the Microcal Origin 7 software package (Microcal Software). The F state of the oxidase was generated as described previously (18Zaslavsky D. Kaulen A. Smirnova I.A. Vygodina T.V. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Konstantinov A.A. Siletskiy S.A. Mitchell D. Kaulen A.D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) by treating the oxidized solubilized or liposome-bound enzyme with H2O2. With the wild type oxidase from R. sphaeroides, the conversion to the F state was found to be complete upon the addition of 2 mm H2O2 at pH 8. This conclusion is significant for interpretation of the electrometric data; therefore, it is worthwhile to delineate in some detail the procedure used to evaluate the yield of the F state. For instance, if the wild type cytochrome oxidase concentration is determined by applying extinction coefficients as published by Rich and co-workers (23Junemann S. Meunier B. Gennis R.B. Rich P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14456-14464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Rich P. Moody A.J. Graber P. Milazzo G. Bioenergetics. 4. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1997: 419-456Google Scholar) (e.g. Δϵ446–462 = 141 mm-1 cm-1 or Δϵ446–416 = 209.6 mm-1 cm-1 for the reduced minus oxidized spectrum), then the absorption changes in the Soret band of the wild type R. sphaeroides oxidase after 2 mm peroxide addition correspond to Δϵ436–414 of 50–53 mm-1 cm-1. This may be compared with Δϵ436–414 of 50.5 mm-1 cm-1 given by Rich and co-workers (23Junemann S. Meunier B. Gennis R.B. Rich P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14456-14464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as 100% yield of the ferryl-oxo state in the wild type COX from R. sphaeroides. Similar Δϵmax-min values (49–54 mm-1 cm-1) were obtained for the peroxide-induced Soret band changes using extinction coefficients for the reduced minus oxidized spectrum of COX, bovine, or R. sphaeroides as reported by other laboratories (25Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenberg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol.

Alternatively, by using extinction coefficients as given by Rich and co-workers (24Rich P. Moody A.J. Graber P. Milazzo G. Bioenergetics. 4. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1997: 419-456Google Scholar, 28Iwaki M. Breton J. Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for the visible part of the R. sphaeroides COX reduced minus oxidized difference spectra (e.g. Δϵ606–621 = 25.7 mm-1 cm-1), a value of Δϵ583–630 ∼5 mm-1 cm-1 was obtained for 2 mm H2O2-induced absorption changes in the visible part, which also indicates complete formation of the ferryl-oxo state of the wild type cytochrome oxidase from R. sphaeroides (cf. Refs. 29Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1867-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 30Wikström M. Morgan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10266-10273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the reaction of the N139D mutant oxidase with 2 mm H2O2 resulted in only ∼70% yield of the ferryl-oxo state as determined from ΔA583–630. Notably, incomplete reaction with hydrogen peroxide has been observed routinely with several other mutants of the R. sphaeroides oxidase with replacements in the D-channel such as D132N, E286Q, E286D, and E286D/D132N. 2S. Siletsky, T. Vygodina, and C. Pecoraro, unpublished observations. Incomplete reaction with H2O2 was also noted for a K-channel mutant K362M (23Junemann S. Meunier B. Gennis R.B. Rich P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14456-14464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of photoreduction of heme a and its subsequent reoxidation in the F → O transition of the wild type and N139D oxidases. Although the rate of heme a reduction is the same for the wild type and mutant enzymes (not shown), the reoxidation kinetics (i.e. electron transfer from heme a to ferryl-oxo heme a3) differ significantly. With the wild type enzyme, reoxidation of the photoreduced heme a is complete, as indicated by the absorption changes at 444 nm. The A444 trace ends up slightly below the initial level because of the smaller absorption contribution at this wavelength from ferric heme a3 (final state) compared with the initial ferryl-oxo state of heme a3. The reoxidation of heme a in the wild type enzyme is fitted best by a biexponential curve with a major phase (70%) with τ of 0.7 ms and a minor phase (30%) with τ of 3.5 ms (Table I). A single exponent fit of the same trace gives τ of 1.2 ms, which compares well with the value of τ ∼1.4 ms reported previously (31Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Table IKinetics of heme a reoxidation in wild type and N139D COX from R. sphaeroidesPhaseWild typeN139DτAmplitudeτAmplitudems%ms%10.7700.15–0.1830–4023.5301.8403820–30 Open table in a new tab The reoxidation of heme a in the N139D mutant oxidase differs from that observed with the wild type oxidase in two respects. First, ∼30% of the flash-reduced heme a in the mutant oxidase is not reoxidized on the time scale observed. This correlates with the observation that the yield of the ferryl-oxo heme a3 species is only about 70% with the N139D mutant oxidase. Presumably, in the 30% of the enzyme population in which heme a3 is not converted to the ferryl-oxo state, the photoreduced heme a remains reduced over the time course of the experiment. Second, in the population of the N139D mutant oxidase in which heme a is reoxidized, the kinetics of the reoxidation is different from that observed with the wild type enzyme (Table I). The N139D reoxidation trace is triphasic with two major components of about equal magnitude (40% each) and τ values of 180 μs and 1.8 ms, followed by a slow residual oxidation phase (τ ∼8 ms, ∼20%), well outside the turnover time range of the enzyme. Fig. 2 shows the electrogenic response coupled to the F → O transition in N139D oxidase, along with the responses observed with both the fully active wild type oxidase and the “dead” E286Q mutant. The traces are normalized by the amplitude of the initial rapid phase, i.e. by the amount of heme a flash-reduced in each of the samples. With the wild type oxidase, the response includes the fast phase (vectorial electron transfer from CuA to heme a) and a slower part resulting from the vectorial intra-protein transfer of protons coupled to the reoxidation of heme a by the binuclear site. This slower cyanide-sensitive part of the response is known to consist of two exponential components, denoted as the intermediate and slow phases (18Zaslavsky D. Kaulen A. Smirnova I.A. Vygodina T.V. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Konstantinov A.A. Siletskiy S.A. Mitchell D. Kaulen A.D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). With the E286Q mutant, there is no electron transfer from heme a to the heme a3/CuB binuclear center, and, consequently, no protonic electrogenic phase is observed (cf. Ref. 22Konstantinov A.A. Siletskiy S.A. Mitchell D. Kaulen A.D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). With the N139D mutant, the rapid electrogenic phase is followed by slower phase, which is a single exponential and has a smaller magnitude than that observed with the wild type oxidase. Characteristics of the electrogenic phases are summarized in Table II. The data for bovine COX are also included for comparison. The wild type trace (Fig. 2) is composed of three phases as follows: rapid (τ ∼15 μs), intermediate (τ ∼0.5 ms), and slow (τ ∼1.5 ms) with the relative amplitudes of 1:0.7:1.7, respectively (or 30, 20, and 50% of the total response), in agreement with the data reported previously for COX from R. sphaeroides (22Konstantinov A.A. Siletskiy S.A. Mitchell D. Kaulen A.D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and for the P. denitrificans oxidase (32Ruitenberg M. Kannt A. Bamberg E. Ludwig B. Michel H. Fendler K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In contrast, the photoelectric trace observed with the N139D mutant, shows only two phases with τ values of about 15 μs and 0.6 ms. The 15-μs phase is obviously the same rapid phase as observed with the wild type oxidase and is assumed to be due to electron transfer from CuA to heme a. The 0.6-ms phase of the N139D mutant is eliminated by performing the experiment in the presence of cyanide (Fig. 2, inset), indicating that, as expected, this phase is linked to electron transfer from heme a to the binuclear site.Table IIPhotoelectric responses of the wild type and N139D mutant forms of cytochrome c oxidase In all samples, the amplitude of the rapid electrogenic phase was taken as 1.0.PhaseBovineaData from Refs. 18 and 19R. sphaeroides, wild typeR. sphaeroides, N139DτAmplitudeτAmplitudeτAmplitude observedAmplitude correctedbCorrected for 30% of the enzyme in which flash-reduced heme a is not reoxidized (see the text)Rapid45 μs1.015 μs1.015 μs1.01.0Intermediate1.2 ms1.00.4 ms0.7Slow4.5 ms3.01.5 ms1.70.62 ms0.91.3SumProtonic4.02.40.91.3Total5.03.41.92.3a Data from Refs. 18Zaslavsky D.

A. (1998) Studies on Electrogenic Electron and Proton Transfer in Cytochrome Oxidase, Ph.D. thesis, Moscow State University, MoscowGoogle Scholar, 35Konstantinov A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that with the wild type R. sphaeroides oxidase, there is a closer match between the optically monitored oxidation kinetics of heme a and the electrogenic proton translocation. Nevertheless, although each of the two traces deconvolutes into two exponentials (Tables I and II), attempts to fit the two curves by the same set of two exponentials gave poor fits. For the N139D mutant, the kinetics of heme a reoxidation and of the protonic phase of voltage generation are also not coincident, which is evident even by visual inspection (Fig. 3B). The kinetics of voltage generation was also monitored in the presence of D2O in place of H2O. The rapid phase of the response is not affected in agreement with the observations on P. denitrificans oxidase (32Ruitenberg M. Kannt A. Bamberg E. Ludwig B. Michel H. Fendler K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4632-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cyanide-sensitive part of the response manifests a significant solvent isotope effect with both wild type and N139D forms of the oxidase. With the wild type oxidase (Fig. 4A and Table III), the effect is mainly associated with the slow electrogenic phase (3.5–4-fold deceleration in the presence of D2O), whereas the intermediate phase slows down by only ∼1.4-fold. This different sensitivity to D2O/H2O replacement provides an important independent experimental basis to distinguish the intermediate and slow phases of the voltage generation in the F → O transition. With the N139D mutant, the cyanide-sensitive phase is decelerated by about 3.5-fold (Fig. 4B and Table III), similar to the H2O/D2O kinetic isotope effect observed for the slow, but not the intermediate, phase in the wild type oxidase. Hence, the residual protonic phase observed in the N139D mutant is proposed to correspond to the slow phase of the wild type oxidase.Table IIIHydrogen isotope sensitivity of the F → O transitionProtonic electrogenic phaseWild typeN139DH2OD2OH2OD2OmsmsIntermediate0.530.77Slow1.464.90.622.44 Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether the 0.6-ms electrogenic phase in the N139D mutant requires the K-channel, the double mutant N139D/K362M was constructed and examined. This double mutant is inactive in steady state turnover as a result of the K362M mutation but has normal absorption characteristics and readily forms the F state with H2O2 with about the same yield of 60–70% as the N139D mutant (not shown). As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, the protonic phase observed with the N139D mutant oxidase is retained in the double mutant (N139D/K362M). It is concluded that the 0.6-ms electrogenic phase in the N139D mutant does not involve proton translocation through the K-channel. At the same time, there are minor but noticeable changes in the charge translocation kinetics in the 50–1000-μs time window resulting from the presence of the K362M mutation in the N139D background (Fig. 5, main panel). Compared with the N139D mutant, the K362M/N139D double mutant exhibits a lag prior to the onset of the electrogenic proton transfer, and the protonic phase itself becomes slightly faster. The modulation of the kinetics of electrogenic proton transfer during the F → O transition can also be observed in comparing the electrogenic traces of the single K362M mutant with that of the wild type oxidase (22Konstantinov A.A. Siletskiy S.A. Mitchell D. Kaulen A.D. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This effect may indicate some cross-talk between the D- and K-channels during the F → O transition. One clear conclusion from this work is that the N139D mutant of the R. sphaeroides oxidase, although not pumping protons (11Pawate A.S. Morgan J. Namslauer A. Mills D. Brzezinski P. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13417-13423Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), generates an electric potential difference across the membrane. The time-resolved studies of charge translocation coupled to the F → O transition with the N139D mutant reveal two electrogenic phases with τ values of about 15 μs and 0.6 ms (at 22 °C, pH 8) that are likely to represent the steps of vectorial electron and proton transfer, respectively, from the opposite sides of the membrane to the oxygen-reducing site buried within the enzyme (Fig. 6A). Hence, the N139D COX from R. sphaeroides may exemplify an oxidase operating by the original redox-loop principle of ΔμH+ generation postulated by Mitchell (5Mitchell P. Chemiosmotic Coupling and Energy Transduction. Glynn Research Ltd., Bodmin1968: 1-111Google Scholar). Several arguments suggest that the 0.6-ms protonic phase in the N139D mutant corresponds to the slow, rather than intermediate, phase of the electrogenic trace observed with the wild type oxidase. Deuterium Solvent Isotope Effect—The 3.5–4-fold deceleration of the protonic electrogenic phase of the N139D mutant in D2O is identical to the kinetic isotope effect observed for the slow (1.5 ms) electrogenic phase of the wild type oxidase, and is much larger than the H2O/D2O solvent kinetic isotope effect on the 0.4-ms intermediate phase of the wild type enzyme (Table III). Rate Constant—The steady state turnover as well as the resolved F → O step of the catalytic cycle are 2–2.5 faster with the N139D mutant than with the wild type oxidase (11Pawate A.S. Morgan J.

Recent studies have shown that LCR core elements recruit RNA polymerase II (pol II). In the present study we demonstrate the following: 1) pol II and other basal transcription factors are recruited to LCR core hypersensitive elements; 2) pol II dissociates from and re-associates with the globin gene locus during replication; 3) pol II interacts with the LCR but not with the β-globin gene prior to erythroid differentiation in embryonic stem cells; and 4) the erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 facilitates the transfer of pol II from immobilized LCR constructs to a β-globin gene in vitro. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the LCR serves as the primary attachment site for the recruitment of macromolecular complexes involved in chromatin structure alterations and transcription of the globin genes.

In the present study we demonstrate the following: 1) pol II and other basal transcription factors are recruited to LCR core hypersensitive elements; 2) pol II dissociates from and re-associates with the globin gene locus during replication; 3) pol II interacts with the LCR but not with the β-globin gene prior to erythroid differentiation in embryonic stem cells; and 4) the erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 facilitates the transfer of pol II from immobilized LCR constructs to a β-globin gene in vitro. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the LCR serves as the primary attachment site for the recruitment of macromolecular complexes involved in chromatin structure alterations and transcription of the globin genes. The five genes of the human β-globin locus are expressed in erythroid cells in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner (1Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Appropriate expression of the globin genes is regulated by many DNA elements that are located proximal and distal to the genes. The human β-globin locus control region (LCR) 1The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; HS, hypersensitive; RT, reverse transcription; Epo, erythropoietin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ES, embryonic stem; NRO, nuclear run-on transcription; TBP, TATA binding protein; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor.1The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; HS, hypersensitive; RT, reverse transcription; Epo, erythropoietin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ES, embryonic stem; NRO, nuclear run-on transcription; TBP, TATA binding protein; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor. is a powerful regulatory DNA element located far upstream of the genes and is required for high level expression of all the globin genes throughout development (1Grosveld F.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 51: 73-94Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The LCR, unlike classical enhancer elements, operates in an orientation-dependent manner (3Tanimoto K. Liu Q. Bungert J. Engel J.D. Nature. 1999; 398: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). There is currently no consensus on how the LCR acts to stimulate globin gene transcription, but it is generally believed that it involves some form of communication between the LCR and the globin genes (4Bulger M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2465-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Engel J.D. Tanimoto K.

The LCR is composed of several regions that exhibit extremely high sensitivity to DNase I in erythroid cells (hypersensitive HS sites 1–5). The core HS sites contain clusters of transcription factor binding sites and are separated from each other by 2–4 kbp (2Hardison R.C. Slightom J.L. Gumucio D.L. Goodman M. Stojanovich N. Miller W. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 51: 73-94Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The results from analyzing human LCR function at ectopic sites in the context of transgenic mice demonstrate that the HS sites synergistically enhance globin gene transcription (7Bungert J. Dave U.

Recent models view the LCR as a holocomplex in which the individual HS sites interact via extensive protein/DNA and protein/protein interactions (7Bungert J. Dave U. Lim K.-C. Lieuw K.H. Shavit J.A.

The LCR holocomplex may provide a highly accessible region for the efficient recruitment of macromolecular complexes involved in chromatin modification and transcription (18Levings P.P. Bungert J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that RNA polymerase II (pol II) is recruited to LCR HS sites in vitro and in vivo (19Leach K.M. Nightingale K. Igarashi K. Levings P.P. Engel J.D. Becker P.B. Bungert J.

Grass J.A. Parker C. Im H. Choi K. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6484-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that transcription complexes are first recruited to the LCR and subsequently delivered to the globin genes (18Levings P.P. Bungert J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Sawado et al. (23Sawado T. Halow J. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that another important function of the LCR is to regulate transcription elongation at the adult β-globin gene. An interesting aspect of gene regulation is the question of how transcriptional activity is maintained after replication (24Gilbert D.M. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Activation of at least some gene loci depends on replication, and it is possible that replication could provide a window of opportunity for transcription factors to gain access to regulatory sequences before repressive chromatin is formed. Generally, transcriptionally active regions of the genome replicate early, whereas repressed parts of the genome replicate late. Accordingly, the globin locus replicates late in nonerythroid cells and early in cells expressing the globin genes. It is not known how replication affects the association of transcription factors and pol II with the globin locus. In this study we analyzed the interaction of transcription complexes with the human and murine β-globin loci in erythroid cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The data demonstrate that pol II and the basal transcription factors TBP and TFIIB interact with LCR core HS sites but not with a region flanking the cores, indicating that transcription initiation complexes associate with the LCR. The analysis of protein/DNA interactions during S-phase in synchronized cells revealed a dynamic pattern of dissociation and re-association of transcription factors and RNA pol II with the globin locus. In addition, we show that core elements of the LCR adopt a structure characteristic of transcriptionally active chromatin and recruit RNA polymerase II prior to erythroid differentiation in murine embryonic stem cells. Finally, we provide evidence that pol II can be transferred from the LCR to a β-globin gene using a novel in vitro system. This transfer is stimulated by the erythroid transcription factor NF-E2. Cell Culture and Protein Extracts—K562 cells were grown in RPMI containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 5% antibiotic mixture (penicillin/streptomycin) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. MEL cells were grown, and protein extracts were prepared as described by Leach et al. (25Leach K.M. Vieira K.F. Kang S.H. Aslanian A. Teichmann M. Roeder R.G. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recombinant NF-E2 (p45 tethered to mafg) was expressed in bacteria as described by Leach et al. (25Leach K.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) Cell Synchronization—K562 cells were synchronized at the border of G1- and S-phase by incubating the cells with complete growth medium in the presence of 2 mm thymidine for 17 h, washing twice with complete medium, incubating in complete medium for 12 h, and blocking the cells in complete medium with 2 mm thymidine for another 17 h (26Dubrez L. Goldwasser F. Genne P. Pommier Y. Solary E. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1995; 9: 1013-1024PubMed Google Scholar). Blocked cells were fixed with ethanol, digested with RNase, stained with propidium iodide, and subjected to flow cytometry to verify synchronization. Blocked cells were taken as “time 0” and subjected to ChIP and PCR analysis. The blocked cells were then washed twice with complete medium to release them from the block and were allowed to grow in complete medium. Cells were taken for flow cytometry, ChIP, and PCR analysis at specific time points after release from the arrest. ChIP—ChIP was performed as described by Leach et al. (25Leach K.M. Vieira K.F.

We used pKO916 (Stratagene) as a negative control probe. Slot blot was performed as described in Kang et al. (29Kang S.H. Kiefer C.M. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell.

RNA was isolated for RT-PCR using the Arum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using 200–250 ng of RNA and the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification was performed using the Eppendorf PCR Mastermix (Eppendorf) and primer sequences specific for Flk-1, Epo receptor, GATA-2, β-actin (30Elefanty A.G. Robb L. Birner R. Begley C.G.

Embryonic Stem (ES) Cell Differentiation—Mouse ES cells were differentiated to generate cells of the hematopoietic lineage using the ES/OP9 method established and described by Kitajima et al. (32Kitajima K. Tanaka M. Zheng J. Sakai-Ogawa E. Nakano T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, ESD3 cells (ATCC, CRL-1934) were seeded onto a confluent monolayer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts at a density of 105cells/25 cm2 in ES media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 106 units/ml LIF), grown for 2 days, and then passaged (1:6) and grown for another day. An aliquot of the cells (3–4 × 107) was taken at this time (day 0) and subjected to RT-PCR and ChIP analysis. The remaining day 0 cells were then seeded onto confluent OP9 stromal cells in OP9 media (α-minimum Eagle's medium with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides; 20% fetal bovine serum) in the absence of LIF at a density of 104 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture dishes. At day 3 Epo was added at a concentration of 2 units/ml for the remainder of the course of induction. On day 5 of induction cells were passaged and reseeded onto fresh OP9 cultures at a density of 105 cells/well. On day 12 cells were collected and subjected to RT-PCR and ChIP analysis. In Vitro Polymerase Transfer Analysis—A plasmid containing the wild-type human β-globin LCR was linearized and immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads as described by Leach et al. (19Leach K.M. Nightingale K. Igarashi K. Levings P.P. Engel J.D. Becker P.B. Bungert J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The immobilized LCR (200 ng) was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 μg of MEL nuclear protein extract (10 μl) and 15 μl of 2× binding buffer (36 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 160 mm KCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol) in a total volume of 100 μl. We performed a protein extract titration experiment and determined that 50 μg of the protein extract was optimal in the reactions. The tubes were placed on a magnet and the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times with 1× binding buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 1× binding buffer and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 50 ng of the plasmid pRSβA/X containing the wild-type or mutant β-globin gene (25Leach K.M. Vieira K.F. Kang S.H. Aslanian A. Teichmann M. Roeder R.G. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The immobilized LCR construct is about four times larger than the β-globin gene construct, so the same molar ratio was used during the transfer. The supernatants were removed, and samples containing the wild-type or mutant β-globin gene were cross-linked by incubation for 10 min in 0.5% formaldehyde at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine and incubation for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant of reactions not containing the β-globin gene were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of pRSβA/X, after which these samples were cross-linked as well. All samples were dialyzed against ChIP dilution buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation using pol II-specific antibodies and PCR analysis as described by Leach et al. (25Leach K.M. Vieira K.F. Kang S.H. Aslanian A. Teichmann M. Roeder R.G. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In some experiments recombinant NF-E2 (25Leach K.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or BSA (0.3 μg/μl) was added to the transfer reactions. The plasmid βmaxi was used as a positive control for the PCR and was generated by ligating an 800-bp Pml1 restriction fragment from the human LCR into the Pml1 site of pRSβA/X. The β-globin PCR primers span the Pml1 site present in the β-globin gene thus generating a PCR product that is 800 bp larger than the PCR product from the wild-type β-globin gene. The TK-HGH plasmid contains the human growth hormone gene under control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (25Leach K.M. Vieira K.F. Kang S.H. Aslanian A. Teichmann M. Roeder R.G. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The HS2 plasmid contains the HS2 core plus flanking sequence as described previously (8Bungert J. Tanimoto K. Patel S. Liu Q. Fear M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3062-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following primers were used in these experiments: β-globin II, US 5′-CCTGAGGAGAAGTCTGCCGTTACTG-3′ and DS 5′-TCCTATGACATGAACTTAACCATAG-3′; TK-HGH, US 5′-GGAGGCTGGAAGATGGCA-3′ and DS 5′-AGTAGTGCGTCATCGTTGTGTG-3′; HS2 as described in the ChIP protocol. In this study we analyzed the interaction of transcription complexes with the human and murine β-globin gene loci, which are shown as a graph also including the location of primers and fragments used in the ChIP and NRO experiments (Fig. 1). Interaction of Transcription Factors and RNA Polymerase II with the β-Globin Locus—We first used ChIP and PCR to analyze the interaction of pol II, TBP, TFIIB, NF-E2 (p45), and acetylated histone H3 with different domains of the human β-globin gene locus in K562 cells, an erythroleukemia cell line expressing the embryonic ϵ-but not the adult β-globin gene. As a negative control we also analyzed the interaction of the proteins with the necdin gene, which is not active in erythroid cells. NF-E2 is a hematopoietic-specific transcription factor composed of a large (p45) and a small (maf) subunit (33Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and is known to interact with sequences in the human and murine β-globin loci (2Hardison R.C. Slightom J.L. Gumucio D.L. Goodman M. Stojanovich N. Miller W. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 51: 73-94Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The data show that pol II is cross-linked to LCR HS2 in K562 cells (Fig. 2a). The interaction of pol II with the globin genes is consistent with the expression pattern in these cells. pol II binding is detectable at ϵ-but not at the β-globin gene. pol II does not interact with the HS2 5′-flanking region, demonstrating that pol II specifically interacts with the core of HS2. We observed interactions of phosphorylated pol II with HS2 and the ϵ-globin gene promoter, indicating active transcription in these regions. Because extragenic transcripts have been detected over the entire LCR in the human β-globin locus (34Ashe H.L. Monks J. Wijgerde M. Fraser P. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2494-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we analyzed the interaction of basal transcription factors that are not associated with the transcription elongation complex. The results show that both TFIIB as well as TBP can be cross-linked to HS2 in K562 cells. This demonstrates that the cross-linking of pol II to HS2 is not solely due to elongating polymerase but is also due to the recruitment of transcription initiation complexes. NF-E2 is clearly detectable at HS2, whereas association with the ϵ-globin gene is weak. The observation that pol II is not detectable in the HS2 5′-flanking region suggests that transcription initiates within the HS2 core enhancer and not upstream of HS2. Therefore, we performed nuclear run-on experiments to determine regions of active transcription in the human β-globin locus (Fig. 2b). Ongoing transcription is detectable in a region upstream of HS5, in the HS2 core, and in the ϵ-globin gene but not in the HS2 5′-flanking region. These results are consistent with the ChIP analysis and suggest that transcripts initiating far upstream of HS2 do not elongate beyond the HS2 5′-flanking region, consistent with results from Kim and Dean (35Kim A. Dean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7028-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transcription upstream of HS5 probably initiates within the long terminal repeat of a retrovirus as described previously (36Long Q. Bengra C. Li C. Kutlar F. Tuan D. Genomics. 1998; 54: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Dissociation and Re-association of RNA Polymerase II with the β-Globin Locus during Early S-phase—We next examined the interaction of transcription complexes with the LCR and globin genes during S-phase in K562 cells (Fig. 3). Cells were synchronized using the double thymidine block method, which arrests the cells at the G1/S-phase boundary (26Dubrez L. Goldwasser F. Genne P. Pommier Y. Solary E. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1995; 9: 1013-1024PubMed Google Scholar). By using semiquantitative PCR with primers specific for the human globin locus and, as a control, the necdin gene, we determined that replication of the β-globin locus is completed by 2 h in K562 cells (data not shown). At specific time points after release from cell cycle arrest, cells were subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking and ChIP analysis. In these experiments, we used antibodies against pol II, NF-E2 (p45), and USF2. We have shown previously that USF2 interacts with the human β-globin promoter in K562 cells (25Leach K.M. Vieira K.F. Kang S.H. Aslanian A. Teichmann M. Roeder R.G. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We analyzed the association of these proteins with four different regions of the human β-globin locus. Cells were cross-linked at time 0, 15, and 45 min and 2 and 6 h after release from cell cycle arrest. At time 0, pol II interacts with HS2, the ϵ- and γ-globin genes, but not with the adult β-globin gene. There is no interaction of NF-E2 or USF2 with the globin locus at this point. The only detectable change after 15 min is the association of NF-E2 with HS2 and the γ-globin genes. After 45 min, pol II is no longer detectable at the ϵ-globin gene but remains associated with HS2 and the γ-globin genes. After 2 h, pol II no longer interacts with the LCR or the ϵ- and γ-globin genes. At this time NF-E2 and USF2 interact with HS2 and the ϵ- and γ-globin genes. The interaction of NF-E2 with the β-globin gene is less pronounced. After 6 h, the dissociation of USF2 from the γ-globin genes and HS2 is accompanied by the reappearance of pol II. The different kinetics in the dissociation and re-association of pol II with the ϵ- and γ-globin genes was observed in multiple experiments (Fig. 3, and data not shown). In some experiments we observed interactions between NF-E2 and HS2 at time 0 and re-association of pol II with the ϵ-globin gene after 6 h (data not shown). The differences could be due to subtle variations in the status of the cells during synchronization. We documented previously (25Leach K.M. Vieira K.F. Kang S.H. Aslanian A. Teichmann M. Roeder R.G. Bungert J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) the interaction of USF2 with the β-globin gene locus in unsynchronized K562 cells. At the time points analyzed here, USF2 was not detectable at the β-globin gene suggesting that the interaction takes place at another time during the cell cycle. RNA Polymerase II Is Recruited to the LCR but Not to the β-Globin Gene in Murine Embryonic Stem Cells Prior to Erythroid Differentiation—We next examined the association of pol II with the murine β-globin gene locus during in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells. In these experiments we utilized the ES/OP9 cell differentiation system described by Kitajima et al. (32Kitajima K. Tanaka M. Zheng J. Sakai-Ogawa E. Nakano T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated ES cells (day 0) express the rex1, β-actin, flk1, and gata-2 genes (Fig. 4a). Most importantly, the βmaj-globin gene is not expressed in these cells. Upon erythroid differentiation (day 12), expression of Rex1 is reduced, as anticipated (31Scherer C.A. Chen J. Nachabeh A. Hopkins N. Ruley H.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1393-1401PubMed Google Scholar), and the globin genes are induced. We analyzed the interaction of pol II and modified histones within the globin locus during the course of differentiation using the ChIP assay (Fig. 4b). We utilized two pol II-specific antibodies, one recognizing both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated pol II (pol II) and one recognizing pol II phosphorylated at serine 5 (pol II Ser-5(P)). We also used antibodies specific for acetylated histone H4 (AcH4) and for dimethylated K4 histone H3 (Me2K4H3). Dimethylation of H3 at lysine 4 is associated with regions permissive for transcription (37Schübeler D. MacAlpine D.M. Scalzo D. Wirbelauer C. Kooperberg C. van Leeuwen F. Gottschling D.E. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Delrow J. Bell S.P. Groudine M. Gene Dev. 2004; 18: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 4b) show that pol II is present at the LCR but not at the β-globin gene in undifferentiated ES cells. The presence of H3 dimethylated at Lys-4 is indicative of active transcription in this region. The β-globin gene is associated with acetylated histone H4 but not H3 dimethylated at Lys-4, suggesting that the chromatin structure is open but not transcriptionally active. The rex1 gene is associated with a chromatin structure characteristic of an open transcriptionally active domain. The primers used for rex1 amplify a region in the body of the gene and thus do not assay for interaction of pol II with the promoter. In differentiated erythroid cells (day 12), pol II is associated with the LCR and the β-globin gene. The enrichment of H3 dimethylated at Lys-4 in these regions is compatible with an open, transcriptionally"

Dissociation to monomers leads to loss of activity. Evidence that LPL dimers rapidly exchange subunits was demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between lipase subunits labeled with Oregon Green and tetrametylrhodamine, respectively, and also by formation of heterodimers composed of radiolabeled and biotinylated lipase subunits captured on streptavidine-agarose. Compartmental modeling of the inactivation kinetics confirmed that rapid subunit exchange must occur. Studies of activity loss indicated the existence of a monomer that can form catalytically active dimers, but this intermediate state has not been possible to isolate and remains hypothetical. Differences in solution properties and conformation between the stable but catalytically inactive monomeric form of LPL and the active dimers were studied by static light scattering, intrinsic fluorescence, and probing with 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphtyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid and acrylamide. The catalytically inactive monomer appeared to have a more flexible and exposed structure than the dimers and to be more prone to aggregation. By limited proteolysis the conformational changes accompanying dissociation of the dimers to inactive monomers were localized mainly to the central part of the subunit, probably corresponding to the region for subunit interaction.

Atherosclerosis. 2003; 170: 1-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The catalytically active form of LPL is a noncovalent homodimer of 55 kDa subunits (5Iverius P.-H.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The functional site of LPL is at the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium, where the enzyme is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (1Merkel M. Eckel R.H. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1997-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 2Mead J.R. Irvine S.A. Ramji D.P. J. Mol.

Inactive monomers are less tightly bound to heparan sulfate (7Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Østergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and are therefore the dominant form of LPL in the circulating blood (8Tornvall P. Olivecrona G. Karpe F. Hamsten A. Olivecrona T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In vitro studies show that the dimeric state of LPL is unstable (9Olivecrona T. Bengtsson G. Borgström B. Brockman H. Lipases. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 205-261Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions (pH, temperature, and concentration of salt), the dimers spontaneously dissociate into monomers within a few minutes. The formed monomers may reassociate but into inactive aggregates (9Olivecrona T. Bengtsson G. Borgström B. Brockman H. Lipases. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 205-261Google Scholar). It is believed that this process is irreversible. The inactivation is strongly prevented by heparan sulfate and heparin (7Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Østergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The dimeric form of LPL is also relatively stable in the presence of high concentrations of salt (at low temperature) (9Olivecrona T. Bengtsson G. Borgström B. Brockman H. Lipases. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 205-261Google Scholar, 10van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the early 1970s this discovery allowed purification of the active enzyme from bovine milk by using adsorption to heparin-Sepharose followed by elution with a salt gradient (5Iverius P.-H. Östlund-Lindqvist A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7791-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Egelrud T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6212-6217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osborne et al. (6Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) showed that the inactivation rate is dependent on the concentration of LPL. On this basis, they proposed that inactivation of LPL includes a step of reversible dissociation of the dimer followed by a step of irreversible unfolding of the dissociated monomers (6Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LPL, pancreatic lipase, hepatic lipase, and endothelial lipase share sequence homologies and together form the mammalian triacylglycerol lipase gene family (12Wong H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A model of the three-dimensional structure of LPL has been constructed based on the x-ray structure of pancreatic lipase (10van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The model is supported by results obtained by other techniques, including limited proteolysis and mutagenesis (12Wong H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 13Lookene A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Santamarina-Fojo S. Dugi K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the overall three-dimensional structures of the lipases appears to be quite similar. In contrast to LPL, pancreatic lipase can exist as a catalytically active monomer (10van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, some important differences in folding or in conformational flexibility between these two proteins are expected. Because of instability and low solubility, the possibilities of using physical techniques for structural studies of LPL are limited. Little is known about the conformational differences between the active dimer and the catalytically inactive monomer. By continuous measurement of circular dichroism, under conditions in which the enzyme slowly lost its catalytic activity, a decrease in the content of secondary structure has been demonstrated (6Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Conformational differences between active and inactive forms of LPL are also implicated by differences in their abilities to react with monoclonal antibodies (15Peterson J. Fujimoto W.Y. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1165-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactive LPL monomers can be demonstrated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (16Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Zhang L. Wu G. Tate C.G. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29344-29351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The affinity of the monomer to heparin is ∼6000-fold weaker than that of the dimer (7Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Østergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the difference in heparin affinities can readily be used for separation of dimers and monomers by affinity chromatography on heparin columns (16Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Zhang L. Wu G. Tate C.G. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. J. Biol.

Basdevant A. Iverius P.-H. Wilson D.E. Lalouel J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20132-20139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional studies have shown that, although the monomers are catalytically inactive, they retain several properties of the active dimer. Monomers are still able to interact with lipoproteins (19Pentikäinen M.O. Oorni K. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5694-5701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In blood the monomers are mainly found together with LDL particles (20Vilella E. Joven J. Fernández M. Vilaró S. Brunzell J.D. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1555-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monomer interacts, although with reduced affinity, with receptors of the LDL-receptor family (21Nykjær A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Weber W. Beisiegel U. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15048-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with dimeric LPL, the receptor-bound monomers are less effective in binding of lipoproteins, probably because the binding sites for lipoproteins and receptors partly overlap (21Nykjær A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Weber W. Beisiegel U. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15048-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether these data demonstrate that the inactive LPL monomer is still folded and rather stable. LPL monomers are found, for example, in blood (22Olivecrona G. Hultin M. Savonen R. Skottova N. Lookene A. Tugrul Y. Olivecrona T. Woodford F.P. Davignon J. Sniderman A.D. Atherosclerosis X. Elsevier, Amsterdam1995: 250-253Google Scholar) and adipose tissue (23Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and are also present in culture media from the expression of recombinant LPL in vitro (17Zhang L. Wu G. Tate C.G. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29344-29351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Krapp A. Zhang H.F. Ginzinger D. Liu M.S. Lindberg A. Olivecrona G. Hayden M.R. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2362-2373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the monomer/dimer ratio in adipose tissue is dependent on the nutritional state (23Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the fasted state more LPL is found in the inactive form (25Bergö M. Wu G. Ruge T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11927-11932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and therefore less of the plasma lipids are taken up for storage, whereas more is used in other tissues for energy production. Studies with actinomycin D indicate that some other protein with a short-lived mRNA regulates the dissociation of LPL into inactive monomers or prevents inactive LPL subunits from forming active dimers (25Bergö M. Wu G. Ruge T. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11927-11932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Wu G. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11925-11930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The details of this important control mechanism are still unknown, but the fact remains that monomeric LPL is present in most tissues and that monomeric LPL is the dominant form of LPL in blood. Recent studies indicate that the levels of this form in plasma correlate to disease (27Hanyu O. Miida T. Obayashi K. Ikarashi T. Soda S. Kaneko S. Hirayama S. Suzuki K. Nakamura Y. Yamatani K. Aizawa Y. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 174: 385-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Many single-point mutations in the LPL gene result in the production of inactive LPL monomers (12Wong H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18Hata A. Ridinger D.N. Sutherland S.D. Emi M. Kwong L.K. Shuhua J. Lubbers A. Guy-Grand B. Basdevant A. Iverius P.-H. Wilson D.E. Lalouel J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20132-20139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore important to investigate the properties of the folded monomer and to understand its relation to the active dimeric form of LPL. In the present investigation we have focused on mechanisms responsible for the spontaneous inactivation of LPL. We demonstrate that the subunits of dimeric LPL rapidly exchange partners. This may be a first step in the process that leads to inactivation of the enzyme. We have used compartmental modeling to study the inactivation mechanism, static light scattering to study aggregation, limited proteolysis to study differences in folding between inactive monomers and active dimmers, and bis-ANS to probe exposure of hydrophobic regions due to unfolding. The largest conformational changes on dissociation of the dimer were located to the middle of the LPL subunit and probably involve areas of subunit interactions. Materials—Bovine LPL was purified from milk (28Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It was iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method and separated from free Na125I by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose as described (16Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amino coupling kit and CM5 sensor chips were from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). Heparin was from Leo Pharma AB (Malmö, Sweden). Oregon Green 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (OG), 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester (TMRA), and bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphtyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid) were from Molecular Probes. LPL was biotinylated as described previously (7Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Østergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins (very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) were isolated from fresh human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C (endo-Glu-C), bovine serum albumin (BSA), streptavidin-agarose, tributyrin, gum Arabic, and acrylamide were from Sigma. Labeling of LPL with OG and TMRA—LPL (0.2–0.5 mg/ml) in 0.2 m NaHCO3, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.4, was incubated with OG or TMRA at 4 °C in the dark. After 1 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of lysine to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 15 min, the mixture was diluted ∼5× with 20 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and immediately applied onto a column of heparin-Sepharose. Labeled LPL was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl in the bis-Tris buffer. Most of the active labeled LPL eluted with a peak at 1.1 m NaCl. The fractions with high LPL activity were pooled. The incorporation of OG and TMRA into LPL was characterized by the degree of labeling (DOL),DOL=Amax[LPL]×ϵdye where Amax is absorbance of OG-LPL or TMRA-LPL at their absorbance maximum wavelength, ϵdye is extinction coefficient of OG or TMRA, and [LPL] is the concentration of the labeled LPL. The ϵdye values used were 70,000 for OG and 65,000 for TMRA. These values were from the website of Molecular Probes. The concentration of LPL was calculated from absorbance, A280 (1%) = 1.68 (29Olivecrona T. Bengtsson G. Osborne Jr., J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fluorescence and Light-scattering Measurements—These experiments were performed on a Fluoro-Max spectrofluorimeter. The conditions are detailed in the legends to Figs. 2, 5, and 6.Fig. 5Differences in inactivation curves when different assay systems were used.A, inactivation time courses recorded in parallel by using tributyrin (•) or Intralipid (○) as substrates. In both cases 8.5 nm LPL was incubated in a solution of 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mg BSA/ml, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 20 °C. The remaining activity is expressed in percent of LPL activity in a sample assayed immediately after dilution in ice-cold buffer. B, decrease of tryptophan fluorescence at 340 nm on excitation at 280 nm under the conditions used in the experiment in A but in the absence of BSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Aggregation of LPL as studied by static light scattering. The experiments were carried out on a spectrophotofluorimeter. Both the excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 500 nm. The intensity of the scattered light was measured at a 90° angle to the direction of the excitation light. The relative values presented were obtained after subtraction of scattering intensity of the incubation solution without LPL. All measurements were performed on 8.5 nm LPL in solutions of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 22 °C, with the indicated additions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding to Streptavidin-Agarose—Equal volumes (0.1 ml) of radiolabeled LPL (0.05 mg/ml, 4000 cpm/μl) and biotinylated LPL (0.05–0.15 mg/ml) were incubated together for 1 min in 10 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Of this incubation mixture, 0.05 ml was added to 2 ml of the same buffer containing 0.3 ml of streptavidinagarose. The mixture was gently shaken for 5 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The radioactivity was determined in the top phase (containing unbound LPL) and in the lower phase (containing sedimented streptavidin-agarose and the bound LPL). Data are expressed as ratios of radioactivity in the sedimented agarose to the total radioactivity added to the system. Nonspecific binding of radioactive LPL to streptavidin-agarose in the absence of biotinylated LPL was subtracted from the data. Binding Studies on BIAcore—Details concerning conditions for these studies are described previously (7Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Østergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument. Biotinylated heparin or biotinylated LPL was bound to the matrix-coupled streptavidin. LDL and VLDL were then injected into these sensorchips in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Activity Measurements—Activity measurements with tributyrin as substrate were performed by continuous titration of butyric acid by a pH-stat (Methrome, Herisau, Switzerland) at 25 °C (13Lookene A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of the substrate were prepared by sonication of tributyrin in a solution of gum Arabic/water (Soniprep, MSE Technology Application Inc.). The enzymatic activity was recorded at pH 8.5 in 0.15 m NaCl containing 30 mm tributyrin and 0.2% gum Arabic. Titration was performed with 25 mm KOH. LPL activity on phospholipid stabilized emulsions of long acyl chain triacylglycerols was measured as described in a previous study (23Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of each sample was incubated in 200 μl of a mixture containing a phospholipid-stabilized emulsion of soy bean triacylglycerols with the same composition as Intralipid 10% (Fresenius-KABI, Uppsala, Sweden), into which tri-[9,10-3H]oleoylglycerol had been incorporated on manufactory. Heat-inactivated rat serum was present as a source of apolipoprotein CII, BSA as fatty acid acceptor, and heparin to stabilize the lipase. One milliunit of lipase activity corresponded to the release of 1 nmol of fatty acid/min at 25 °C. All samples were assayed in triplicate. Mathematical Modeling of the Inactivation Process—Mathematical modeling of the transfer of LPL between different states was done using SAAMII (simultaneous analysis and modeling), version 1.1 (SAAM Institute, Seattle, WA). This software allows compartmental modeling of complex systems using linear as well as nonlinear models. The error of the data was set to a fractional standard deviation of 0.1. Proteolytic Cleavage—Limited cleavage of LPL by chymotrypsin and trypsin was carried out in 0.1 m Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at 10 °C. In the case of monomeric LPL the cleavage reactions also contained 1.0 m guanidinium chloride. The protease/LPL mass ratio was 5%, and the cleavage reactions were stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a 10-fold molar excess over trypsin or chymotrypsin. Digestion by endo-Glu-C was performed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with or without 1.0 m guanidinium chloride. The reactions were stopped by heating the samples at 90 °C for 15 min. The cleavage products were analyzed on Tricine-SDS-PAGE using 15.5% polyacrylamide gels. Mass Spectrometry and Sequence Analyses—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to analyze the products of the proteolytic cleavage reactions. The analyses were performed on a home-made mass spectrometer at the National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics (Tallinn, Estonia). The matrix dihydrobenzoic acid was dissolved in 1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. A 0.5-μl aliquot of the cleavage mixture was deposited on a stainless steel probe. The mass determination was accurate enough only for peptides smaller than 10 kDa. For larger peptides, N-terminal sequences were determined on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 477A pulsed liquid-phase sequencer. Monomer Exchange Kinetics Studied by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer— To investigate whether the subunits of dimeric LPL are stably bound to each other or whether they rapidly exchange partners, we studied fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two differently fluorescence-labeled LPL dimers. One portion of LPL was labeled with OG and another portion with TMRA. Control experiments showed that both variants, named OG-LPL and TMRA-LPL, maintained 70–80% of the activity of the unmodified enzyme, that their activities were stimulated by apolipoprotein CII, and that they eluted from heparin-Sepharose at around 1.1 m NaCl, which corresponded to the elution pattern of unlabeled, dimeric LPL. BIAcore studies showed that both labeled forms of LPL were able to interact with lipoproteins (VLDL and LDL) similarly to unmodified LPL (data not shown). Taken together these results showed that the labeling of LPL by TMRA or OG did not change the functional properties of the dimeric LPL. Increasing the ratio of dye to LPL led to an increased degree of labeling at low ratios (<2 mol/mol), but at higher ratios (>4 mol/mol) the incorporation of label approached saturation (Fig. 1). The maximal degrees of labeling were similar, 2.1 mol/mol for the OG-LPL and 2.2 mol/mol for the TMRA-LPL. In the following experiments the labeling was between 1.9 and 2.1 mol/mol LPL dimer. When mixed together (Fig. 2A), TMRA-LPL significantly quenched the fluorescence emission of OG-LPL, as measured between 510 and 530 nm on excitation at 480 nm. A rapid decrease (half-life less than 5 s) in fluorescence of the OG-LPL variant was observed after the addition of TMRA-LPL, but after that the fluorescence was stable for hours (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C presents the fluorescence spectra of OG-LPL in the presence of increasing concentrations of TMRA-LPL. The effect was concentration-dependent with a tendency to saturation at higher concentrations of TMRA-LPL (Fig. 2D). When TMRA-LPL was titrated with OG-LPL, the fluorescence of TMRA groups increased between 540 and 570 nm on excitation at 480 nm (data not shown). These observations demonstrated that fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurred between OG and TMRA groups when the labeled variants of LPL were mixed, suggesting formation of heterodimers of subunits from OG-LPL and TMRA-LPL, respectively. Fig. 2D demonstrates that fluorescence energy transfer did not occur when the experiments were carried out under denaturating conditions (in 1 or 6 m guanidinium chloride). The fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the labeled proteins was not affected by the presence of heparin (15 IU/ml) or by lipoproteins (LDL, 0.1 μg protein/ml) in the incubation mixture (data not shown). Subunit exchange between LPL dimers was also demonstrated by binding experiments to streptavidin-agarose. In this case 125I-labeled LPL was incubated with biotinylated LPL, and then streptavidin-agarose beds were added. After centrifugation, the radioactivity bound to the gel was determined. Despite the high nonspecific binding of 125I-labeled LPL to the matrix (20–30% of the total), there was a significant increase of radioactivity after mixing of the radiolabeled enzyme with biotinylated LPL (Table I). Because biotinylation or iodination has previously been shown not to affect the activity or the dimeric structure of LPL (16Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the increased binding of radioactivity to the gel suggested formation of heterodimers of subunits from 125I-labeled LPL and biotinylated LPL, respectively.Table IBinding of 125I-labeled LPL to streptavidin-agarose in the presence of different concentration of biotinylated LPLAdded biotin-LPLBound radioactivitymg/ml% of total0.0623 ± 50.1133 ± 70.1544 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Studies of Inactivation of LPL and Modeling of the Inactivation Process—Osborne et al.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reported that the relative inactivation rate is faster at lower concentrations of LPL and proposed that the inactivation is a two-step process including a reversible dissociation of LPL dimers followed by an irreversible unfolding of the monomers. In the present study we revisited the inactivation of LPL with the aim of analyzing the inactivation process by compartmental modeling and also of obtaining estimates for rate constants. The inactivation kinetics was measured for a wide variation of LPL concentrations under different conditions (Fig. 3). The effect of the concentration of the LPL protein was observed only under conditions in which the enzyme was relatively stable, as in 0.3 m NaCl at 20 °C (Fig. 3A) or in 0.15 m NaCl with 15 IU of heparin/ml at 37 °C (Fig. 3B). In 0.15 m NaCl without heparin, where the inactivation rate was fast, the effect of LPL concentration was less pronounced (Fig. 3C). In this case, inactivation followed simple monoexponential decay kinetics. It was pos"

When Nur77 was exogenously introduced, it enhanced the transcriptional activity of HIF-1, whereas the dominant negative Nur77 mutant abolished the function of HIF-1.

Trends. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 stimulates the transcription of diverse genes encoding proteins that function to increase oxygen delivery, to allow metabolic adaptation, and to promote cell survival. HIF-1 consists of α and β subunits, both of which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNTSIM (bHLH-PAS) protein family. Whereas HIF-1β, the previously described aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, is quite stable under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is extremely unstable and is quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (2Huang L.E.

The tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein interacts with hydroxylated HIF-1α at proline residues in the presence of oxygen, leading to the proteolysis of HIF-1α (4Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K.

Specific prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) catalyze the hydroxylation of the proline residue in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α (6Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D.

Three human PHDs, i.e. PHD1, -2, and -3, are expressed ubiquitously, although each isoform differs in the relative amount of transcripts expressed (7Cioffi C.L. Liu X.Q. Kosinski P.A. Garay M. Bowen B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Further activation of HIF-1α involves its nuclear translocation, dimerization with HIF-1β, DNA binding, and the recruitment of its transcriptional coactivators, such as the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (9Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cooperative binding of VHL and the factor-inhibiting HIF-1, which recruits histone deacetylases to HIF-1α under normoxic conditions, represses the transactivation function of HIF-1α (10Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Indeed, the factor inhibiting HIF-1 was identified as an asparaginyl hydroxylase enzyme that modifies asparagine 803 of HIF-1α using an oxygen molecule, which results in the dissociation of HIF-1α and its coactivator p300 (11Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). These processes are regulated by post-translational modifications, in that the phosphorylation of HIF-1α via the Ras/Raf/MEK/p42/p44 signaling pathway leads to an enhanced transactivation function of HIF-1α (12Richard D.E.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1216-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, acetylation of HIF-1α by ARD-1 was shown to enhance its interaction with VHL, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α (14Jeong J.W. Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn T.K. Bae M.H. Yoo M.A. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Kim K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Although hypoxia is a strong and universal stimulus that activates HIF-1, a significant number of other hormonal, environmental, and intracellular stimuli have been reported to induce HIF-1 activation, probably in a cell-type-specific manner (15Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 16Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40112-40117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). One of these factors, p53, a key regulator of the response to cellular stress, directly interacts with HIF-1α and decreases the level of HIF-1α protein by promoting mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)-mediated ubiquitination and the subsequent proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α (18Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, oncogenic proteins such as v-Src and RasV12 result in the loss of hydroxylated proline 564 and thereby stabilize HIF-1α (17Chan D.A. Sutphin P.D. Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40112-40117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that hepatitis B virus X protein, a major viral transactivator of hepatitis B virus, increases the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α by stabilizing the protein via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway (19Yoo Y.G. Oh S.H. Park E.S. Cho H. Lee N. Park H. Kim D.K. Yu D.Y. Seong J.K. Lee M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39076-39084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the stability of HIF-1α is modulated by a variety of intracellular proteins, which may indicate as yet unidentified cross-talk between hypoxia and other physiological signals. Nur77 (also known as NGFI-B, N10, TIS1, and NAK-1) is an orphan member of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily of transcriptional factors that positively or negatively regulate gene expression. It is composed of an N-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (20Winoto A. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nur77 binds as a monomer to the Nur77-binding response element (NBRE), which contains the hexanucleotide 5′-AGGTCA-3′, a typical recognition motif of the RAR/RXR family, and two A residues preceding this hexanucleotide (21Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Nur77 also binds DNA as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (22Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 23Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Nur77 is constitutively active when overexpressed, suggesting that the orphan receptor does not require ligand stimulation. Various lines of evidence have suggested a role for Nur77 in cellular proliferation and apoptosis, two major cellular processes. Nur77 expression is rapidly induced by growth factors and mitogens (24Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 25Williams G.T. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6124-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Yoon J.K. Lester F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor and serum induce Nur77 expression, which exerts mitogenic effects (27Kolluri S.K. Bruey-Sedano N. Cao X. Lin B. Lin F. Han Y.H. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8651-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nur77 is also rapidly induced by T-cell receptor signaling in immature thymocytes and T-cell hybridomas, which is followed by apoptotic cell death (28Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 29Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A.

Apoptosis is also induced by many apoptosis-inducing agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs, and the apoptotic process is associated with the translocation of Nur77 into the mitochondria (27Kolluri S.K. Bruey-Sedano N. Cao X. Lin B. Lin F. Han Y.H. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8651-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X.

Recently, it was reported that the interaction of Nur77 with the Bcl-2 apoptotic machinery converts Bcl-2 from a protector to a killer (32Lin B. Kolluri S.K. Lin F. Liu W. Han Y.H. Cao X. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Zhang X.K. Cell. 2004; 116: 527-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Because Nur77 is involved in both cellular proliferation and apoptosis, Nur77 is implicated in the development and progression of tumors, which are considered to result from a disturbance in the balance between these two processes. In the present study, we report a novel function of Nur77 in potentiating the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α and suggest a potential role for Nur77 in tumor progression and metastasis. Cell Culture and Hypoxic Treatment—Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HB 8065) and Hep3B (ATCC HB 8064), human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (ATCC CCL-2), human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (HTB-22), human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (ATCC CRL-1573), and mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 (CRL-1658) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were exposed to hypoxia (0.1% O2) by incubating the cells in an anaerobic incubator (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) in 5% CO2, 10% H2, and 85% N2 at 37 °C. Hypoxia was also induced chemically by treating the cells with 100 μm CoCl2 (Sigma) or 100 μm desferrioxamine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). When the cells were exposed to hypoxia, the medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum was used. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice, and whole cell lysates were obtained by subsequent centrifugation. 50 μg of protein from whole cell lysates were subjected to 8–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Blocking was performed in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with specific antibodies against HIF-1α, VEGF, VHL, MDM2, phosphorylated p42/p44, p42/p44, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), FLAG (Sigma), or α-tubulin (Oncogene, Boston, MA) as described previously (19Yoo Y.G.

To detect Nur77 protein, 500 μg of whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-Nur77 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and probed with mouse anti-Nur77 antibody (BD Biosciences) (33Lee M.O.

Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) were used, and immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Super Signal (Pierce). The protein concentration was quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).

The truncated constructs of Nur77, Nur77NT (amino acids 1–203), and Nur77Hga (amino acids 252–601) were constructed by inserting corresponding PCR-amplified fragments into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of p3XFLAG™7.1 (Sigma). The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HIF-1α (GFP-HIF-1α) and the far-red fluorescent protein-tagged Nur77 (Red-Nur77) were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified fragments into pEGFP-C3 and pHcRed1-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. All of the new construction was confirmed by sequencing. For transient expression of protein, 293 (1 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate or 3 × 106 cells/100-cm2 dish), MCF-7 (5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate or 1.6 × 106 cells/100-cm2 dish), or NIH3T3 (5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate or 1.6 × 106 cells/100-cm2 dish) cells were seeded and incubated overnight. The cells were transfected with 2–4 μg of expression vector using LipofectaminePlus® (Invitrogen) or Polyfect® (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), as described previously (19Yoo Y.G. Oh S.H. Park E.S.

For reporter gene analysis, HepG2 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well culture plates and incubated overnight. The cells were transfected with reporter plasmid (0.2–0.3 μg), β-galactosidase (β-gal) expression vector (0.2 μg) in the presence or absence of Nur77 expression vector using LipofectaminePlus® (Invitrogen). At the end of treatment, luciferase activity was determined using an analytical luminescence luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the corresponding β-gal activity. For statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance was performed using GraphPad Instat® (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.). PCR reaction was performed as described previously (19Yoo Y.G.

Real-time PCR was performed with specific primers for Nur77 (forward, 5′-GACTGCCCTGTGGACAAGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTGTTCGGACAACTTCCTTCA-3′; probe, 5′-6FAM-ACCGCTGCCAGTTCTGCCGCTT-BHQ1–3′) and GAPDH (forward, 5′-GACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TAGCCCAGGATGCCCTTGAG-3′; probe, 5′-Texas Red-CCGACG CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCT-BHQ2–3′). cDNA corresponding to 1 μg of RNA was added to the iQ™ Supermix (Bio-Rad). PCRs were carried out in a real-time PCR cycler (iCycler iQ, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The thermal profile was 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, and 56 °C for 30 s. At the end of each phase, fluorescence was measured and used for quantitative purposes. Nur77 expression data were normalized to GAPDH content, and the relative transcript level was calculated using the formula as described previously (35Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—293 cells (1.5 × 104 cells/chamber) that had been plated the previous day on a 4-chamber slide glass were transfected with 0.5 μg of each of GFP-HIF-1α or Red-Nur77 using Polyfect®. Transfected cells were treated with or without 100 μm CoCl2 for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the cells were fixed with 50% acetone/50% methanol for 5 min, and the cells were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Olympus). 4′,6-Diamidino-2 phenylindole was used to stain nuclei. Induction of Nur77 Gene Expression under Hypoxia—To examine the possibility that Nur77 is involved in the hypoxic signaling pathway, we investigated the regulation of Nur77 expression under hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 1A, when HepG2 cells were incubated under hypoxic conditions, the expression of Nur77 protein was dramatically induced. The induction of Nur77 was observed as early as 30 min after exposure, and it continued for 24 h. When the cells were treated with a hypoxia-mimicking agent, CoCl2, a similar pattern of induction was observed. The level of Nur77 induction under hypoxia was as close as that induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, well known activators of Nur77 (36Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The induction of Nur77 was accompanied by an increase in HIF-1α. PMA and ionomycin treatment also induced the expression of HIF-1α protein, which confirms recently published data that indicate PMA induces stabilization of HIF-1α (37Chun Y.S. Lee K.H. Choi E. Bae S.Y. Yeo E.J. Huang L.E. Kim M.S. Park J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8700-8707PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the increased Nur77 protein was transcriptionally active, we performed reporter gene analysis using a reporter construct encoding NBRE, a Nur77-binding response element (33Lee M.O. Kang H.J. Cho H. Shin E.C. Park J.H. Kim S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with the induction at the protein level, the reporter was activated in the presence of CoCl2 at a level even higher than that observed in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. The reporter activity was further enhanced when HIF-1α was cotransfected, indicating that HIF-1α may have a role in the induction of Nur77 under hypoxia (Fig. 1B). Next, we evaluated whether the increase in Nur77 was mediated at the level of transcription. The Nur77 transcripts increased after 30 min and were maximal at 9 h after CoCl2 treatment (Fig. 1C). These results were reproduced when Nur77 mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. Consistently, the activity of the reporter encoding the Nur77 promoter was enhanced in the presence of CoCl2, and it was further increased by cotransfection with HIF-1α (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that the expression of Nur77 is induced under hypoxia at the level of transcription. Nur77 Increases the Transcriptional Activity as Well as the Nuclear Accumulation of HIF-1α—Next, we asked the biochemical and pathophysiological meaning of Nur77 induction in response to hypoxic stress. We predicted cross-talk between Nur77 and HIF-1, because HIF-1α is a major regulator of gene expression in response to hypoxia. Therefore, we examined whether Nur77 increases HIF-1 activity using reporter gene analysis with transient cotransfection of the Nur77 expression vector and a reporter gene containing hypoxia response element (HRE) sequences that locates in the erythropoietin gene promoter (9Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, cotransfection of the Nur77 expression vector into HepG2 cells activated HRE reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the expression of DN-Nur77 did not. Reporter activity was further enhanced when cells were treated with CoCl2, and maximal activity was observed when both Nur77 and HIF-1α were cotransfected. Importantly, DN-Nur77 strongly suppressed CoCl2-induced HRE reporter activity. These results indicate that Nur77 enhances the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions and even in the absence of hypoxic stress. For the transcriptional activation of HIF-1α, the protein is required to translocate into the nucleus (38Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the subcellular localization of HIF-1α was examined with immunofluorescence studies using GFP-fused HIF-1α. GFP-HIF-1α was localized diffusely in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the absence of CoCl2, whereas it was accumulated only in the nucleus in the presence of CoCl2 (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the level of GFP-HIF-1α was enhanced and accumulated in the nucleus when Nur77 was cotransfected. These results demonstrate that Nur77 increases protein level as well as the nuclear translocation of HIF-1α. Nur77 Increases the Stability of HIF-1α—To evaluate whether Nur77 increases the stability of HIF-1α, we introduced Nur77 into 293 cells and measured the level of HIF-1α protein. Expression of HIF-1α, as well as that of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was increased with the expression of Nur77 and was further increased in the presence of CoCl2 (Fig. 3A). Although VEGF mRNA was greatly induced, HIF-1α mRNA levels remained unchanged in the presence of Nur77 (Fig. 3B). Because these results indicate that Nur77 increases the level of HIF-1α protein (perhaps through the stabilization of HIF-1α), we measured HIF-1α protein in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks de novo protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3C, Nur77 induced strong expression of HIF-1α and blocked the degradation of HIF-1α as efficiently as CoCl2 treatment did. The majority of HIF-1α protein was degraded within 5 min under normoxia, but the integrity of HIF-1α was maintained in the presence of either CoCl2 or Nur77 up to 60 min. N-terminal Transactivation Domain of Nur77 Is Sufficient to Stabilize HIF-1α—Nur77 is composed of an N-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (Fig. 4A). We dissected Nur77 to identify the functional domain that enhances the stability of HIF-1α. Interestingly, the N-terminal transactivation domain alone showed almost full activity in stabilizing HIF-1α, whereas the Nur77Hga construct showed little stabilizing activity (Fig. 4B). Because the Nur77Hga construct has dominant negative function (20Winoto A. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of the construct on the stabilization and transactivation of HIF-1α. As shown in Fig. 4C, Nur77Hga repressed HIF-1α stabilization as well as the expression of VEGF that is induced by CoCl2. These results are consistent with the results of the reporter gene analysis shown in Fig. 2A. The function of the N-terminal transactivation domain that induced the activation of HIF-1 was further confirmed by the reporter gene assays using the HRE reporter (Fig. 4D). Nur77 Represses the Expression of MDM2, thereby Decreasing the Association between HIF-1α and MDM2—Finally, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which Nur77 enhances the stabilization of HIF-1α protein. We examined whether Nur77 influences the association between HIF-1α and VHL, which subsequently drives the ubiquitin proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. As shown in Fig. 5A, when cells were treated with MG132 (which blocks proteasome function), the binding of HIF-1α and VHL was strong, indicating that the binding of VHL to HIF-1α precedes degradation of HIF-1α under normoxia, as described previously (4Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 5Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this binding was largely diminished in the presence of CoCl2, although this binding was not affected when Nur77 was expressed. This result indicates that VHL is involved in the hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF-1α, but it may not be associated with the Nur77-induced stability of HIF-1α. Because the ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α is also regulated by MDM2, we investigated whether Nur77 reduces the binding of HIF-1α to MDM2. MDM2 bound strongly to HIF-1α in the presence of MG132. However, this binding was completely abolished in the presence of either CoCl2 or Nur77 (Fig. 5B). In the presence of CoCl2 or Nur77, the expression of MDM2 protein was largely decreased, suggesting that the loss of MDM2 protein caused the decrease in association of HIF-1α and MDM2. We further studied the down-regulation of MDM2 expression by Nur77. When Nur77 was expressed in 293 cells, MDM2 expression was completely inhibited. Similar results were obtained with other cell lines such as MCF-7"

By using f/f and F/? rats, we studied whether the LR is involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever and hypothermia. The body temperature responses to LPS (10 or 100 microg/kg iv) were measured in Koletsky rats exposed to a thermoneutral (28 degrees C) or cool (22 degrees C) environment. Rats of both genotypes responded to LPS with fever at 28 degrees C and with dose-dependent hypothermia at 22 degrees C. The fever responses of the f/f and F/? rats were identical. The hypothermic response of the f/f rats was markedly prolonged compared with that of the F/? rats. The prolonged hypothermic response to LPS in the f/f rats was accompanied by enhanced NF-kappaB signaling in the hypothalamus and an exaggerated rise in the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The f/f rats did not respond to LPS with an increase in the plasma concentration of corticosterone or adrenocorticotropic hormone, whereas their F/? counterparts did. The hypothermic response to TNF-alpha (80 microg/kg iv) was markedly prolonged in the f/f rats. These data show that the LR is essential for the recovery from LPS hypothermia. LR-dependent mechanisms of the recovery from LPS hypothermia include activation of the anti-inflammatory hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, inhibition of both the production and hypothermic action of TNF-alpha, and suppression of inflammatory (via NF-kappaB) signaling in the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2002044283,"Expression of the Escherichia coli nucleoid-associated protein Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) is controlled at the transcriptional level in accordance with the nutritional availability. It is highly expressed during early logarithmic growth phase in cells growing in rich medium but poorly expressed in late logarithmic and stationary phase. However, fis mRNA expression is prolonged at high levels throughout the logarithmic and early stationary phase when the preferred transcription initiation site (+1C) is replaced with A or G, indicating that initiation with CTP is a required component of the regulation pattern. We show that RNA polymerase-fis promoter complexes are short lived and that transcription is stimulated over 20-fold from linear or supercoiled DNA if CTP is present during formation of initiation complexes, which serves to stabilize these complexes. Use of fis promoter fusions to lacZ indicated that fis promoter transcription is sensitive to the intracellular pool of the predominant initiating NTP. Growth conditions resulting in increases in CTP pools also result in corresponding increases in fis mRNA levels. Measurements of NTP pools performed throughout the growth of the bacterial culture in rich medium revealed a dramatic increase in all four NTP levels during the transition from stationary to logarithmic growth phase, followed by reproducible oscillations in their levels during logarithmic growth, which later decrease during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase.

Fis levels are transcriptionally regulated according to the nutritional conditions and the growth phase (17Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dramatic burst in fis mRNA levels is observed when stationary phase cells are outgrown in rich medium, which reach a peak during early logarithmic growth phase, decrease to much lower levels during late logarithmic growth phase, and become undetectable during stationary phase (17Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R.

The fis mRNA half-life is short (about 2 min) and does not vary appreciably throughout the period of growth phase-dependent expression, indicating that the fis mRNA expression pattern is not attributed to changes in mRNA turnover rates but is primarily attributed to transcriptional control (20Pratt T.S. Steiner T. Feldman L.S. Walker K.A. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6367-6377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such drastic changes in intracellular Fis levels are likely to influence its role as a global gene regulator. Prolonged Fis expression well into stationary phase is detrimental to cell viability (21Osuna R. Lienau D. Hughes K.T. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, cells must maintain the capacity to carefully regulate fis expression in order to transiently benefit from its advantageous contributions under conditions favoring rapid cell growth but then seek protection from its harmful effects during stationary phase or starvation by ensuring timely Fis depletion. The regulation of fis mRNA expression represents an important step in controlling the intracellular Fis levels. Its importance is emphasized by the strict conservation of this expression pattern in other bacterial species (21Osuna R. Lienau D. Hughes K.T. Johnson R.C. J.

Nevertheless, growth phase-dependent regulation (GPDR) 1The abbreviations used are: fis P, the fis promoter; GPDR, growth phase-dependent regulation; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; KGlu, potassium glutamate; RNAP, RNA polymerase; ppGpp, guanosine tetraphosphate; nt, nucleotide(s). continues to be observed at the mRNA level in the absence of Fis, integration host factor, or stringent control (17Ball C.A.

Both the GPDR and the response to stringent control only require the minimal promoter sequence from about –38 to +5 (18Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Pratt T.S. Steiner T. Feldman L.S. Walker K.A. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6367-6377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the precise interactions between RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the minimal promoter DNA sequence plays a determining role in these processes. Mutations within this minimal promoter region were obtained that altered the GPDR but not its response to stringent control, and vice versa (24Walker K.A. Atkins C.L. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the two processes are controlled by nonredundant mechanisms involving distinct regulatory signals.Most E. coli σ70 promoters initiate transcription with purines (25Lisser S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, fis P is unusual in its preferential use of CTP to initiate transcription, which occurs from a site located 8 nucleotides downstream of the –10 promoter region (23Mallik P. Pratt T.S. Beach M.B. Bradley M.D. Undamatla J. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Walker K.A. Atkins C.L. Osuna R. J.

Replacement of +1C with either A or G resulted in prolonged high level expression throughout logarithmic growth phase and early stationary phase (24Walker K.A. Atkins C.L. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the tight GPDR pattern of fis is strongly linked to a predominant use of CTP at +1C as the transcription initiation nucleotide.In this work, we present a general characterization of fis transcription in vitro showing that transcription initiation complexes at fis P are short lived at physiologically relevant salt concentrations and that formation of stable transcription initiation complexes requires high concentrations of CTP, its primary initiating NTP. We provide evidence in support of the notion that fis expression is sensitive to the intracellular pools of the initiating NTP. We measured cellular levels of all four NTPs during stationary phase and throughout the logarithmic growth phase and show the entire pattern of expression of these nucleotides when cells are grown in rich medium. We find that CTP pools fluctuate during the logarithmic growth phase in a pattern that is compatible with a role of this nucleotide in regulating fis expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals, Enzymes, and Growth Media—Chemicals, enzymes, and growth media were as described (23Mallik P.

Generally, cells were cultured in modified MOPS medium, which contained 0.6 mm potassium phosphate (31Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol.

For the pyrimidine auxotrophs, this medium was further supplemented with 112 μg/ml uracil (or 20 μg/ml uracil for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium), 92 μg/ml UMP (30Wilson H.R. Archer C.D.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar). The primers were oRO109 (5′-dGCTGATATTGTCCGATG) and oRO360 (5′-dAACTGCAGTACTCATACTCTTCC), which anneal to the fis mRNA from +54 to +38 and the β-lactamase mRNA from +41 to +27, respectively. Total RNA was prepared using the hot acid phenol extraction method (35Case C.C. Roels S.M. Gonzalez J.E. Simons E.L. Simons R.W.

The E. coli fis gene was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by extension of random primers (28Sambrook J.E. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar) and used as probe. The fis mRNA signals were detected by autoradiography and quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.).In Vitro Transcription—Single-round transcription reactions were performed with either linear or supercoiled templates as described (23Mallik P. Pratt T.S. Beach M.B. Bradley M.D. Undamatla J. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), with modifications in salt concentrations as described for each experiment. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (pRO362) was purified by two passages through a CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation (28Sambrook J.E. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar). Linear DNA was either pRO362 linearized with PvuII or a 283-bp fragment containing the fis P region from –168 to +83 flanked by 12 and 20 bp of vector DNA sequence upstream and downstream of this region, respectively. Typically, a 5-fold molar excess of RNA polymerase was incubated with the DNA template in transcription buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and the indicated concentration of KCl or potassium glutamate (KGlu) at 37 °C for 10 min to allow maximum formation of open complexes. Subsequently, 10 μg/ml heparin, 80 μm ATP, 80 μm CTP, 80 μm GTP, 4 μm UTP, and 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were added to the mixture and incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C to allow transcript synthesis. When high concentrations of UTP were present in the initial binding mixture, the nucleotide concentrations in the extension mixture were 80 μm CTP, 80 μm UTP, 80 μm GTP, 4 μm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. For half-life determinations of RNAP-fis P complexes, experiments were similarly conducted, except that the NTP extension mixtures were added at time intervals after heparin addition. The heparin concentration of 10 μg/ml was experimentally tested to be sufficient to completely challenge free RNA polymerase under all conditions used. A 10-fold higher heparin concentration showed no further reduction in either the amount or the half-life of transcription initiation complexes formed at fis P in either linear or supercoiled DNA templates. Multiple-round transcription reactions were performed by incubating 0.5 pmol of RNAP with 0.01 pmol of supercoiled pRO362 at 22 °C in transcription buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 80 μm GTP, 80 μm UTP, 4 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and either 80 μm or 2 mm CTP. The electrophoretically separated products were subjected both to autoradiography and quantitation by phosphorimaging.β-Galactosidase Assays—Saturated cultures of RO1087 and RO1089 were diluted 75-fold in supplemented C medium containing either 1 mm uracil or 0.25 mm UMP, grown at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.3, and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity as described (36Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar).Two-dimensional Thin Layer Chromatography—Saturated cultures of the desired strains were diluted into fresh medium, from which 4 ml was transferred to a fresh flask and made 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (167 μCi/μmol specific activity). Nucleotides were obtained using the formic acid method of extraction as described (31Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates were prewashed as described (37Randerath E. Randerath K. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 16: 126-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and two-dimensional TLC was performed as described (38Jensen K.F. Houlberg U. Nygaard P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Guided by the chromatographic behavior of the unlabeled GTP, ATP, CTP, and UTP, we identified the corresponding 32P-labeled NTPs on the TLC. Spots were quantified by phosphorimaging, and the molar quantities of NTP were determined by comparison of individual spot intensities with that of an average of three control spots, each containing 1 μl of the 32P-labeled growth medium (0.6 nmol of phosphate). Nearly all of the phosphate incorporation detected must have occurred at the NTP γ-position, since we did not detect 32P-labeled NMPs or NDPs in our TLC plates within the limits of the exposure times used. By combining the information from the relative spot intensities, specific activity of 32P, cfu/ml obtained at each time during growth at which cells were harvested, and the volume of the cell extract spotted onto the TLC plates, we expressed the relative NTP levels as pmol of NTP/107 cells.RESULTSAs shown previously (17Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mallik P. Pratt T.S. Beach M.B. Bradley M.D. Undamatla J. Osuna R. J.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4783-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the fis promoter initiates transcription predominantly with CTP from +1C and much less efficiently with GTP from –2G (Fig. 1A). When the fis P +1C was replaced with either A or G, the preference for initiation from this position increased and resulted in a noticeably prolonged high level expression throughout logarithmic growth and into early stationary phase compared with the wild type promoter (24Walker K.A. Atkins C.L. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Walker K.A. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4783-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Replacement of +1C with T resulted in some degree of reiterative transcription (not shown), most likely due to the three consecutive T nucleotides positioned in the region from +1 to +3 that could result in multiple UTP incorporation at the 5′-end (39Han X. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, its overall expression pattern more closely resembled that of the wild type promoter than those of either the +1C→ A or +1C→ G promoters (Fig. 1B). In all cases, transcription increased from undetectable levels in stationary phase to its maximum levels after about 30–60 min, but, in the cases of +1C and +1T, fis mRNA levels dropped to a minimum after about 120 min of growth in these cultures and then exhibited a small peak by about 150 min of growth before dropping again to very low levels during late logarithmic and early stationary phase. Thus, the simple switch from predominant transcription initiation with pyrimidine to purine caused a substantial change in the overall fis mRNA pattern of expression during cell growth. We hypothesized that fis P transcription responds to the availability of its initiating NTP and that use of a very poor choice of initiation NTP, as is CTP (26Hershberg R. Bejerano G. Santos-Zavaleta A. Margalit H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wu C.W. Goldthwait D.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2237-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar), exacerbates its dependence on this nucleotide to give a narrow GPDR pattern in vivo.Transcription Initiation Complexes at fis P—To begin addressing this hypothesis, we performed in vitro transcription with a 283-bp DNA fragment carrying the fis P region from –168 to +83, such that transcription from fis P was expected to generate a 103-nucleotide (nt) transcript. We found that this transcript could not be detected if 100 mm KCl or KGlu was present in the reaction. However, at lower concentrations (e.g. <30 mm KGlu), a 103-nt transcript could be detected (Fig. 2A). Confirmation that both the directionality and size of the transcript were of those expected for fis P was obtained from use of a fragment containing additional downstream sequence, which resulted in a correspondingly larger transcript (not shown). The range of salt concentration tolerance was narrower for KCl than for KGlu (Fig. 2B), suggesting an enhanced sensitivity to the presence of Cl– anions. MgCl2 concentrations above 10 mm also hindered transcription. Such high sensitivity to salt concentrations suggested that RNA polymerase (RNAP)-fis P complexes are very unstable.Fig. 2Salt sensitivity of fis P. A, run-off trans"

The transcriptional activation function of Pax-5 requires an intact N-terminal DNA-binding domain and is strongly influenced by the C-terminal transactivation domain. We report the identification and characterization of five human Pax-5 isoforms, which occur through the alternative splicing of exons that encode for the C-terminal transactivation domain. These isoforms arise from the inclusion or exclusion of exon 7, exon 8, and/or exon 9. Three of the Pax-5 isoforms generate novel protein sequences rich in proline, serine, and threonine amino acids that are the hallmarks of transactivation domains. The Pax-5 isoforms are expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cancerous and non-cancerous B cell lines, as well as in primary B cell lymphoma tissue. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the isoforms possess specific DNA binding activity and recognize the PAX-5 consensus binding sites. In reporter assays using the CD19 promoter, the transactivation properties of the various isoforms were significantly influenced by the changes in the C-terminal protein sequence. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that human Pax-5 isoform expression is modulated by specific signaling pathways in B lymphocytes.

The development of B lymphocytes initiates from a common hematopoietic stem cell progenitor and proceeds according to a specific and coordinated process, which results in the production of mature B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells. This differentiation program is tightly regulated by the precise deployment of stage- and lineage-specific B lymphoid transcription factors that include EBF, E2A, and PAX-5 or the B cell-specific activator protein (BSAP) 1The abbreviations used are: BSAP, B cell-specific activator protein; PST, proline, serine, and threonine; TA, transactivation; TD, transactivation domain; RT, reverse transcription; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PHA, phytohemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: BSAP, B cell-specific activator protein; PST, proline, serine, and threonine; TA, transactivation; TD, transactivation domain; RT, reverse transcription; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PHA, phytohemagglutinin. among others (1Schebesta M.

Dev. 2003; 13: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Pax-5 belongs to the Paired Box (Pax) gene family which, in humans, is composed of nine conserved genes. A hallmark of Pax genes is the paired domain, a DNA-binding domain that recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences (reviewed in Ref. 3Barr F.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that Pax genes are important regulators of embryonic development and organogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 4Underhill D.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 5Dahl E. Koseki H. Balling R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The Pax genes influence subordinate gene activity at the transcription level and thereby modulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (6Strachan T. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Tremblay P. Gruss P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 61: 205-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Mansouri A.

Furthermore, Pax genes can also act as proto-oncogenes and have the potential to induce neoplastic transformation (10Maulbecker C.C. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 11Kozmik Z. Sure U. Ruedi D. Busslinger M. Aguzzi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5709-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tissue screening studies have shown that the Pax-5 gene is expressed in the embryonic central nervous system, B lymphocytes, and adult testis (12Adams B. Dorfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Pax-5 expression, in early lymphocyte differentiation, specifies lineage commitment to B cell development over other hematopoietic cell fates (13Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In the absence of Pax-5, B cell development in mice fails to proceed beyond the pro-B cell stage (13Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 14Urbanek P. Wang Z.Q. Fetka I. Wagner E.F. Busslinger M. Cell. 1994; 79: 901-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The PAX-5 protein or BSAP has been shown to bind to the promoter regions of several B cell-specific targets including CD19, LEF-1, blk, and mb-1, of the Ig genes (reviewed in Ref. 15Hagman J. Wheat W. Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Negri J. Dizon F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 169-194PubMed Google Scholar). Pax-5 belongs to a sub-group of Pax genes that also includes Pax-2 and Pax-8. All three possess a paired domain, an octapeptide, and a partial homeodomain. Previous studies have shown that all three genes encode for distinct transactivation domains (TD) rich in proline, serine, and threonine (PST) and inhibitory domains in the C-terminal portion of their respective proteins (16Dorfler P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dorfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21088-21093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, both Pax-2 and Pax-8 in humans have a number of alternatively spliced isoforms with significantly altered protein sequence and structure in their respective C-terminal domains (17Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dorfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6024-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In certain cases, splicing events remove either or both the transactivation and inhibitory domains, whereas in other cases, novel protein domains are generated via shifts in the reading frame. In most cases, these C-terminal modified isoforms possess transactivation (TA) properties that are different from the full-length version of the protein (17Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dorfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6024-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similarly, alternative splicing events in the N-terminal paired domain of Pax-6 generate multiple protein isoforms with different DNA-binding properties (20Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 21Jaworski C. Sperbeck S. Graham C. Wistow G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Murine and human Pax-5 is known to possess a number of alternatively spliced mRNAs (22Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K.

Blood. 2002; 100: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In mice, these alternatively spliced mRNAs produce protein isoforms that modify the amino acid sequence of the full-length BSAP protein, and accordingly, these changes alter the DNA binding affinity and/or transcriptional activity (25Lowen M. Scott G. Zwollo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42565-42574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to investigate the possible existence of isoforms in the C-terminal region of the human Pax-5 gene. We report the identification, characterization, and expression patterns of these novel Pax-5 isoforms from healthy B lymphocytes as well as B cell lines and primary lymphoma samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these isoforms are translated into proteins that possess different TA properties and are generated in response to different cell activation pathways. Screening of Human B Cell cDNA Library for Pax-5 Isoforms and Sequence Analysis—CD19-positive cells were isolated from primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors with an autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) apparatus using a CD19 positive selection mixture. All steps were performed rapidly on ice to minimize any cellular activity and/or RNA degradation. RNA extractions from target cells were done using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the standard protocol. RNA extracts were then reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and cloned in the pBluescript plasmid vector. Transformed bacterial colonies were then isolated, characterized, and sequenced. DNA sequencing was performed in-house using an ALFexpress II automated DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Lines and Stimulation Procedures—The lymphoid cell lines Raji, 293T, and Jurkat E6.1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). REH and Nalm-6 were kindly provided by Dr. Edward A. Clark, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, and the TA cell line, which is derived from Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized healthy mature B cells, was kindly provided by Dr. André Darveau, University Laval, Québec, Canada. Cell lines were maintained in complete culture medium made of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). PBMCs from healthy donors were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. CD19-positive cells were isolated from PBMCs with an autoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) apparatus using a CD19-positive selection mixture. Specific B cell subpopulations were isolated by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) cell sorting using CD10, CD19, CD20, and CD38-labeled antibodies. Patient lymph node biopsies were obtained with informed consent and subsequently selected from a library of B cell lymphoma diagnoses from the Pathology Department of the Dr. Georges L. Dumont Hospital. Murine cells were obtained from the excision of spleen and thymus of Balb/c mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Montréal, Québec, Canada). Cells were either left untreated or treated (as described in figure legends) with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 20 ng/ml; Sigma)/ionomycin (1 μm; Calbiochem) or with phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 3 μg/ml; Sigma). For time course experiments, Raji cells were synchronized through serum deprivation using culture medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 16 h. Nested PCR Analyses—The PCR analyses were conducted through nested reactions using two different sets of Pax-5-specific primers (Table I). The reaction mixtures were composed of 1.5 μg of DNA, 200 μm each of four deoxynucleotide triphosphates along with MgCl2 (2 mm), AmpliTaq buffer (1×), and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). This reaction mixture was then denatured (10 min at 94 °C) followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, and finally 10 min at 72 °C for complete polymerization. The primer pairs used for these experiments included BSAP 5′ and BSAP 3′ (binding regions exon 1 and 10, respectively), which amplify full-length human Pax-5 (1200-bp fragment) and a nested pair of primers exon 5 and exon 10 AS (binding regions exon 5 and 10, respectively). The primers amplifying full-length murine Pax-5 correspond to the oligonucleotides identified mBSAP 5′ and mBSAP 3′ where the nested oligonucleotides are mExon 5 and mExon 10 AS. Each RT-PCR was performed in at least two separate experiments. As controls, primer sets were used to amplify DNA fragments from either the G3PDH gene or the β-tubulin gene (Table I).Table IOligonucleotide primer sequences used in this studyPrimer nameSequence (5′ to 3′)BSAP 5′GTCCATTCCATCAAGTCCTGBSAP 3′CTCCAAGGGTCAGTGACGGExon 5GACACCAACAAGCGCAAGAExon 10 ASGGTCAGTGACGGTCATAGGCmBSAP 5′GACCATCAGGACAGGACAmBSAP 3′TGTAGGAAGAATACTGAGGGTGmExon 5GACACCAACAAACGCAAGAmExon 10 ASAGGGCTGTAATAGTATGGGGG3PDHGTCAACGGATTTGGTCTGTATTG3PDH ASAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGATβ-TubulinATGAGGGAAATCGTGCACTTGCAGβ-Tubulin ASCATGGTGCCGGGCTCCAGATCβ-Tubulin (nested)TGTTTGTCTACTTCCTCCTGβ-Tubulin (nested)ASTACCCATCCCAGACCC Open table in a new tab Plasmids and Cloning—The plasmids CD19-luciferase (26Nutt S.L. Morrison A.M. Dorfler P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2319-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by M. Busslinger (Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria). All Pax-5 isoform variants were cloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene) and subsequently subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) using a directional cloning technique involving the XhoI, XbaI, and NotI restriction sites depending on the original orientation of the insert. Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Transient transfections of the 293T cell line using the Polyfect™ transfection kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105/well) 48 h pre-transfection where they received a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA that was complexed with the provided transfection reagent. Cell extracts were then performed according to the intended analysis. Reporter gene assays were conducted using the Dual-Luciferase System™ (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfections included 200 ng of Renilla luciferase (pRL) (Promega) as a control. After 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (Promega) by shaking at room temperature for 30 min. Lysates were then analyzed with a luminometer (BMG Fluostar Optima) to measure luciferase activity. Relative reporter activity was calculated and normalized based on Renilla-luciferase activity that reflects transfection efficiency. At least three separate experiments were performed, each in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Cells (2 × 106) were lysed using 0.5 ml of RIPA lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS along with freshly added 10 μl/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mg/ml), 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 10 μl/ml sodium orthovanadate (100 mm)). Cell extracts were then incubated on ice for 20 min and pre-cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Thereafter, 80 μg of protein extract was mixed with 20 μl of 2× electrophoresis sample SDS-PAGE buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was then blocked with 3% gelatin and incubated with either anti-C- or anti-N-terminal Pax-5 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Signals were revealed with an enhanced chemiluminescent kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the described microscale preparation protocol (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6420Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 25 μl of a 10% solution of Nonidet P-40 was added, and the tube was vigorously vortexed for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 s at 12,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.4 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min on a shaking platform. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fractions were stored at –70 °C until used. EMSA experiments were performed as described in Ruscher et al. (28Ruscher K. Reuter M. Kupper D. Trendelenburg G. Dirnagl U. Meisel A. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear protein extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 15 μl of the binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40% glycerol, 10% Ficoll, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin fraction V) containing 1 ng of Cy5-labeled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligonucleotide. The following consensus binding site dsDNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as probes and/or competitors: Pax-5 (5′-Cy5-GAATGGGGCACTGAGGCGTG-3′) and AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′). DNA-protein complexes were resolved from polyacrylamide gels fragment analysis software combined with a ALFexpress II apparatus. Cold competition assays were carried out by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled dsDNA oligonucleotide simultaneously with the labeled probe. Sequence Accession Numbers—The newly identified sequences were thereafter submitted to GenBank™ and filed as Homo sapiens BSAP alternatively spliced mRNAs as follows: full-length Pax-5 (accession number AY463952), Pax-5Δ7 variant (AY463953), Pax-5Δ8 variant (accession number AY463954), Pax-5Δ9 variant (AY463955), Pax-5Δ7/8 variant (AY463956), and Pax-5Δ7/8/9 variant (accession number AY463957). Identification of Novel Pax-5 Isoforms in Normal Human B Cells—Our studies of Pax-5 gene expression in normal and malignant B cells led us to investigate possible alterations in the 3′-coding region of the Pax-5 mRNA. A cDNA library was constructed from a pool of CD19+ cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 13 healthy donors. The library was screened by RT-PCR using Pax-5-specific primers that span exons 5–10. On the basis of cDNA length, six distinct variants of Pax-5 cDNA clones were identified (Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis confirmed that one group of Pax-5 cDNA clones was identical in length to the published coding sequence for the full-length (FL) human Pax-5 mRNA (herein referred to as Pax-5 FL). Most interestingly, the remaining five groups correspond to novel Pax-5 cDNAs with discrete gaps in the 3′-coding region of the gene sequence. These gaps correspond precisely to deletions of exon 7, exon 8, exon 9, exons 7 and 8, or exons 7, 8, and 9 (herein referred to as Pax-5Δ7, Pax-5Δ8, Pax-5Δ9, Pax-5Δ7/8, and Pax-5Δ7/8/9, respectively). Translation of these novel alternatively spliced mRNAs into their putative protein sequences revealed several noteworthy characteristics. Fig. 1, B and C, illustrates the exon boundaries and corresponding protein domains of the full-length Pax-5, whereas Fig. 1D shows the exon and protein domain alignment of the five alternatively spliced isoforms. The Pax-5Δ8 and Pax-5Δ9 isoforms both use in-frame fusions of flanking exons and conserve the same reading frame and stop codon as the Pax-5 FL transcript. Pax-5Δ8 produces a protein lacking 34 amino acids entirely within the transactivating domain. whereas Pax-5Δ9 produces a protein lacking 29 amino acids that span the end of the transactivating domain and the beginning of the inhibitory domain. Most strikingly, all Pax-5 isoforms with a deletion of exon 7 (i.e. Pax-5Δ7, Pax-5Δ7/8, and Pax-5Δ7/8/9) undergo a shift in the reading frame that generates novel protein sequences (Fig. 1D, solid box). The deletion of exon 7 in Pax-5Δ7 causes a reading frameshift immediately after exon 6, which, in turn, terminates translation prematurely in exon 8. This results in the production of a novel protein sequence of 28 amino acids. Reading frameshifts are also observed in Pax-5Δ7/8 and Pax-5Δ7/8/9, both of which begin at exon 6 splice donor junction and extend past the full-length Pax-5 termination codon in exon 10 to generate novel protein sequences of 64 and 35 amino acids, respectively. It is noteworthy that in isoforms Pax-5Δ7, Pax-5Δ7/8, and Pax-5Δ7/8/9, the new sequences contain a higher ratio of PST in comparison to the TD of Pax-5 FL (Table II).Table IIRelative amounts of proline, serine, and threonine in PAX-5 isoformsIsoformTotal size (amino acids)Total % PSTTrans-domain size (amino acids)% PST trans-domainFL39128.114136.2Δ728825.73839.5Δ835727.010734.6Δ936227.411235.7Δ7832428.77446.0Δ78929526.84544.5 Open table in a new tab Expression of Alternatively Spliced Pax-5 Isoforms in Human B Cells—To investigate the Pax-5 isoform expression patterns from individual donor samples, specific primer pairs were designed to enable the amplification of the following: 1) the entire coding region of the Pax-5 cDNA, and 2) a nested product spanning exons 5–10. For this experiment, primary CD19+ B cells from 13 healthy donors were analyzed individually (Fig. 2A). As a control, cloned FL Pax-5 cDNA was amplified in parallel and yielded an anticipated 602-bp product containing the entire coding sequences of exons 6–10. The nested RT-PCR of donor samples revealed distinct amplification products that were shorter in length compared with the control Pax-5 FL. In addition, the isoform expression profiles were different in nearly each individual, and no correlation could be established between the observed Pax-5 isoform expression patterns and either donor age, gender, or race (data not shown). We then set out to investigate the Pax-5 isoform expression profiles in various B cell lines. RT-PCR analysis was used to examine the isoform expression profiles from immature (Nalm6 and REH; lanes 1 and 2, respectively) as well as mature (TA cell line and Raji; lanes 3 and 4, respectively) cells from the B cell lineage (Fig. 2B). Multiple Pax-5 amplicons that were shorter than the amplified Pax-5 FL control were observed. Most interestingly, the Pax-5 FL variant did not appear to be the predominant isoform in some of the cell lines tested. Because several studies have shown that aberrant expression of Pax-5 is implicated in the development of a certain type of B cell lymphomas, namely lymphoplasmocytoid lymphoma, we investigated Pax-5 isoform expression in RNA extracts from lymph nodes of patients diagnosed with B cell lymphoma using nested RT-PCR. As depicted in Fig. 2C, most of the B cell lymphoma assessed expressed a single predominant isoform. In a majority of these samples, except for Fig. 2C, lane 2, Pax-5 FL was the sole isoform present, whereas the splice variant Pax5Δ8 was the sole isoform in the remaining cases. The observed expression profiles of Pax-5 isoforms have yet to reveal any consistent correlation with the medical diagnoses for the patients. In the past decade, numerous studies have correlated the expression of the orthologous Pax-5 gene in the development of murine B cells. To investigate the presence of alternatively spliced transcripts in the C-terminal region of Pax-5 in mouse, we performed an identical nested RT-PCR experiment using murine-specific primers targeting the corresponding region of the Pax-5 transcript. RNA extracts from murine thymus and spleen were examined in parallel with human PBMCs and Raji cells as controls. The nested amplification of the 3′ end of the murine Pax-5 transcript revealed the presence of a single 600-bp amplified fragment in murine thymus (lane 1) and spleen (lane 2) samples (Fig. 2D). In contrast, no amplification of human Pax-5 fragments was detected using murine-specific primers in neither human PBMCs (lane 3) nor Raji (lane 4) cell samples; although amplification of a positive control, β-tubulin (280 bp), was achieved in all samples (data not shown). These results suggest that differences in Pax-5 isoform expression exist between human and mouse hosts. Pax-5 Isoforms Are Translated in Human B Cells—To confirm the anticipated putative protein sequences from the human Pax-5 isoforms, we performed Western blot analysis on total protein extracts from 293T cells transiently transfected with the cloned human Pax-5 isoforms (Fig. 3A). By using an anti-human PAX-5 antibody specifically recognizing the N-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 3A, top panel), all isoforms appeared at their expected molecular weight (lanes 1–6). Subsequently, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-PAX-5 antibody specific for the C-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 3A, middle panel). As expected, only isoforms Pax-5 FL, Pax-5Δ8, and Pax-5Δ9, which possess an in-frame exon 10, were revealed (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 3, and 4, respectively). Conversely, isoforms Pax5Δ7, Pax5Δ7/8 and Pax5Δ7/8/9 were not recognized by the C-terminal antibody. As a control the blot membrane was probed with an anti-tubulin antibody (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Evidence for the expression of lower molecular mass PAX-5 protein variants in B cell samples was also obtained by Western blot analysis. Total cell lysates from B cell lines (Raji, TA, and REH), a T-cell line (Jurkat), a lymph node, as well as from 293T cells transiently transfected with various Pax-5 isoforms were immunoblotted with an anti-PAX-5 antibody directed against the N-terminal region (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the Jurkat T cell line (Fig. 3B, lane 5), all B cell extracts, as well as transfected control cells (lanes 6–9), expressed the PAX-5 protein. In addition, the anti-PAX-5 antibody revealed protein bands at lower molecular weights in extracts from lymph node (Fig. 3B, lane 1) and REH (lane 4) cells. These smaller proteins have molecular masses of ∼27 and 35 kDa, which correspond to the calculated molecular mass of the isoforms Pax-5Δ7 and Pax-5Δ78. Moreover, these lower molecular mass proteins comigrate with transfected Pax-5Δ7 and Pax-5Δ78, respectively, in the control samples (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 9). These results demonstrate that lower molecular mass variants of the PAX-5 protein are expressed in the various samples tested and do not represent products generated from partial proteolysis. Pax-5 Isoforms Have DNA Binding Ability and Transcriptional Activation Properties—To assess further the role and function of the lower molecular mass PAX-5 protein variants, we first investigated the DNA binding capacity of these proteins through EMSA. Nuclear extracts from transiently transfected 293T cells with the various human PAX-5 isoforms were incubated with a Cy5-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the PAX-5 consensus binding sequence. The formation of multiple shifted PAX-5-DNA complexes was observed (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–8). The specificity of these complexes was confirmed using a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled PAX-5 consensus DNA probe (Fig. 4A, lanes 9–14). Conversely, the PAX-5-DNA complexes were preserved in the presence a 100-fold excess of a nonspecific DNA probe corresponding to the AP-1 consensus motif (Fig. 4A, lanes 15–20). These results strongly suggest that each"

To study the possible role of the heme of the cytochrome c550 we constructed two mutants of Thermosynechococcus elongatus in which the residue His-92, the sixth ligand of the heme, was replaced by a Met or a Cys in order to modify the redox properties of the heme. The H92M and H92C mutations changed the midpoint redox potential of the heme in the isolated cytochrome by +125 mV and –30 mV, respectively, compared with the wild type. The binding-induced increase of the redox potential observed in the wild type and the H92C mutant was absent in the H92M mutant. Both modified cytochromes were more easily detachable from the Photosystem II compared with the wild type. The Photosystem II activity in cells was not modified by the mutations suggesting that the redox potential of the cytochrome c550 is not important for Photosystem II activity under normal growth conditions. A mutant lacking the cytochrome c550 was also constructed. It showed a lowered affinity for Cl– and Ca2+ as reported earlier for the cytochrome c550-less Synechocystis 6803 mutant, but it showed a shorter lived S2QB− state, rather than a stabilized S2 state and rapid deactivation of the enzyme in the dark, which were characteristic of the Synechocystis mutant. It is suggested that the latter effects may be caused by loss (or weaker binding) of the other extrinsic proteins rather than a direct effect of the absence of the cytochrome c550.

Myers J. Science. 1963; 142: 234-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as a soluble monoheme c-type cytochrome. The cyt c550 has a molecular mass of about 15 kDa, His/His coordination and a very low redox potential around –260 mV (for review see Ref. 2Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.

The three-dimensional structure of the PS II from two thermophilic cyanobacteria strains confirmed that cyt c550 binds to the luminal PS II surface in the vicinity of the D1 and CP43 proteins (6Zouni A.

The phenotype of the ΔpsbV (cyt c550-less) mutant of Synechocystis PCC 6803 was already characterized with respect to PS II activity (9Shen J.R. Vermaas W. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Mol. 1995; 270: 6901-6907Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Shen J.R. Burnap R.L. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12661-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Shen J.R. Qian M. Inoue Y. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ΔpsbV and the double ΔpsbV/ΔpsbU (encoding the 12 kDa protein) mutants were unable to grow in the absence of Ca2+ and Cl– ions, their PS II activity decreased to 40% of the wild type, and they showed a very rapid inactivation of the enzyme in the dark (after 2 h, the activity decreased about 90% whereas in the wild type only 25% of the activity was lost). A slight retardation in O2 release from the S3 state was also observed in these mutants. Another effect observed in these Synechocystis PCC 6803 mutants was a large intensity decrease of the B band of thermoluminescence (TL) and an upshift in the temperature maxima of the B and Q bands. The upshift of the TL bands was attributed to the lack of the 12 kDa protein, and the decrease in the intensity of the B band was considered to be the major effect of cyt c550 deletion (11Shen J.R. Qian M. Inoue Y. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All these observations led the authors to propose that cyt c550 functions in maintaining the high affinity of PS II for Ca2+ and Cl– and in protecting the Mn-cluster from attack by bulk reductants (9Shen J.R.

However, we have recently demonstrated that the cyt c550 from the thermophilic cyanobacteria Thermosynechococcus elongatus has a significantly higher E′m value when it is bound to the PS II (–80/–100 mV) compared with its soluble form after its extraction from PS II (–240 mV at pH 6) (14Roncel M.

Moreover, while the E′m of the bound form is pH-independent, the E′m of the soluble form varies from –50 mV at pH 4.5 to –350 mV at pH 9–10 (14Roncel M. Boussac A. Zurita J.L. Bottin H. Sugiura M.

In conditions more native than isolated PS II complexes, it is possible that the E′m of cyt c550 may be even higher than –80/–100 mV, and thus a redox function in the water oxidation complex could be conceivable. The thermophilic cyanobacterium T. elongatus has become a new model organism for photosynthesis research since it has provided the first resolved x-ray crystallographic structures of PS I (15Jordan P. Fromme H.T. Witt O Klukas W Saenger N. Krauβ N Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) and PS II (6Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauβ N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, cyt c550 is encoded by the psbV gene, however in the thermophilic strains T. elongatus and T. vulcanus, the genome contains a second gene (psbV2) encoding a cyt c550-like protein located between the psbV1 gene (encoding cyt c550) and the petJ gene (encoding cyt c6, soluble electron donor of PS I) (16Katoh H. Itoh S. Shen J.R. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that this gene is expressed (17Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Bottin H. Tran K.T. Sugiura M. Cascio D. Desbois A. Yeates T.O. Kirilovsky D. Boussac A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PsbV2 protein has an apparent molecular mass of about 15.3 kDa and contains a six-coordinated low spin c-type heme, and the sixth ligand seems to be the Tyr-86. The role of the PsbV2 protein is unknown. The present study is an attempt to analyze the possible role of the heme of the cyt c550 in PS II. To address this problem, two mutants of the thermophilic cyanobacterium T. elongatus were constructed. In these mutants, the His-92, the sixth ligand of the heme, was changed to a methionine or cysteine to modify the redox properties of the heme. In addition, in these two mutants, the psbV2 gene was disrupted by an antibiotic cassette in order to allow its selection. Two other mutants were constructed and studied here: a psbV2-disruptant mutant (ΔpsbV2) as a control strain, and a psbV1-disruptant mutant (ΔpsbV1 or cyt c550-less mutant). Strain and Standard Culture Conditions—Cells of the transformed strain of T. elongatus with a histidine tag on the CP43 protein of PS II (43-H strain) (18Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and all the other mutants constructed for this work were grown in a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 45 °C under continuous illumination from fluorescent white lamps giving an intensity of about 80 μmol of photons m–2 s–1. Cells were grown in a DTN medium (19Mühlenhoff U. Chauvat F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in a CO2-enriched atmosphere. For maintenance, the cells were grown in the presence of kanamycin (40 μg ml–1) or spectinomycin (25 μg ml–1)/streptomycin (10 μg ml–1). For PS II preparations, the cells were grown in 3-liter conical flasks (1500 ml of culture). For Ca2+ depletion, in the DTN medium, CaCl2 was replaced by NaCl. For Cl– depletion, CaCl2, FeCl3, and NH4Cl were replaced by CaOH2, FeNH4(SO4)2, (NH4)2SO4, respectively. Cloning, Recombinant Plasmids, and in Vitro Mutagenesis—The genome region containing the psbV1 and psbV2 genes was amplified using genomic DNA of T. elongatus as template and two synthesized oligonucleotides: psV1, 5′-CGCGGATCCACATGAACAGTGTACGCTGT-3′ and psV2, 5′-CCGGAATTCAACGGAGTTCTCCTTTCAT-3′, containing the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, were used as primers. The amplified region of 1.5 kb containing the psbV1, psbV2 genes and the flanking regions was first cloned in the polylinker EcoRV restriction site of a pBC-SK+ chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid (dpV1 plasmid) and then in the BamHI restriction site of a pUC9 ampicillin-resistant plasmid (dpV2 plasmid). Insertional inactivation of the psbV2 gene was carried out by inserting a 2.2-kb DNA fragment containing the aadA gene from Tn7, conferring resistance to spectinomycin and streptinomycin (Sp/Sm) (20Golden J.W. Wiest D.R. Science. 1988; 242: 1421-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), in the unique BstAPI restriction site of the psbV2 gene in the dpV1 plasmid (dpV3 plasmid). Insertional inactivation of the psbV1 gene was achieved with the insertion of the Sp/Sm cassette in the unique BsaAI restriction site of psbV1 in the dpV2 plasmid (dpV4 plasmid). Site-directed mutagenesis of the plasmid containing the interrupted psbV2 gene (dpV3 plasmid) was performed using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene as recommended by the manufacturer. Synthetic mutagenic oligonucleotides: 5′-GAAATTGCTGAGGTGATGCCCAGTCTGCGCAGT-3′ and 5′-GAAATTGCTGAGGTGTGCCCCAGTCTGCGCAGT-3′ were used to create in the psbV1 gene the H92M and H92C mutants, respectively. These primers delete the unique ApaLI restriction site of the psbV1 gene. Transformation of T. elongatus Cells and Genetic Analysis of Mutants—The plasmids containing the interrupted genes and the site-mutated genes were introduced in 43-H T. elongatus cells by electroporation according to Ref. 19Mühlenhoff U. Chauvat F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar with slight modifications. After washing once with 2 mm Tricine, 2 mm EDTA, and twice with double-distilled water, the cells were resuspended at an OD750 of about 100 (approx 1 × 1011 cells ml–1). 40 μl of this suspension was mixed with 4–8 μl of a 0.5–1 μg μl–1 DNA and chilled on ice. Cells were electroporated in chilled, sterile cuvettes with a 2 mm gap between the electrodes with a single pulse with a time constant of 5 ms and at field strength of 9 kV/cm. After electroporation, cells were rapidly transferred to 2 ml of DTN and incubated for 48 h in a rotary incubator at 45 °C under low light conditions. Then, the cells in 0.1–0.2 ml aliquots were spread on Sp/Sm-containing plates (12 μg ml–1/6 μg ml–1) and incubated at 45 °C, under dim light and humidified atmosphere. Once transformants emerged as green colonies after 2–3 weeks, they were spread at least twice on agar plates containing 25 μg ml–1 spectinomycin and 10 μg ml–1 streptinomycin before their genomic DNA was analyzed. Genomic DNA was isolated from T. elongatus cells essentially as described by Cai and Wolk (21Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To confirm the homoplasmicity of the ΔpsbV2 and ΔpsbV1 mutants a PCR analysis was carried out using primers psV1 and psV2. To verify that the desired point mutations were present in the transformed T. elongatus cells, a PCR fragment containing the psbV1 gene was obtained using the oligonucleotides psV0, 5′-TCCGGCACCGCCCCCAAGGATAAT-3′ and psV6, 5′-CCGGCGCGATCGTCCAGCCCAGCA-3′. The amplified fragment was then digested by the restriction enzyme ApaLI. The mutant PCR fragments were then sequenced to confirm that the correct mutation was the only modification present in the gene. Thylakoids and PS II Core Complexes Preparation—Thylakoids and PS II core complexes were prepared as described by Roncel et al. (14Roncel M. Boussac A. Zurita J.L. Bottin H. Sugiura M. Kirilovsky D. Ortega J.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 1) All the buffers used in the preparations contained 1 m glycinebetaine and 10% (v/v) glycerol. 2) The supernatant of the β-d-dodecyl-maltoside treated thylakoids was mixed with 1 volume of Probond™ resin (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and immediately transferred to an empty column and washed. 3) The PS II preparations were resuspended in 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 m glycinebetaine at about 2 mg of Chl·ml–1. The preparations used in this work had an oxygen evolution activity of 2200–3000 μmol of O2·mg Chl–1·h–1. Cytochrome c550 Isolation—Cyt c550 from the ΔpsbV2 mutant was isolated from soluble proteins as described in Ref. 17Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Bottin H. Tran K.T. Sugiura M. Cascio D. Desbois A. Yeates T.O. Kirilovsky D. Boussac A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and from PS II preparations as described in Ref. 23Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P. Verbavatz J-M. Gobin R. Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W. Sugiura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22809-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar. Cyt c550 from H92M and H92C mutants were isolated only from PS II preparations. Incubation of isolated PS II complexes in a solution of 20 mm MES, pH 6.5 containing 10 mm sodium ascorbate for 1 h (4 °C) under daylight induced the release of the cyt c550 from the PS II. The PS II cores were precipitated by centrifugation (170,000 × g, overnight). The supernatant containing the 33 kDa protein, the 12 kDa protein, and the cyt c550 was concentrated, and then the cyt c550 was purified by HPLC on a Hi-Trap Q Sepharose HP column (Hepes 10 mm, pH 7, sodium ascorbate 10 mm, 0–1 m NaCl gradient). Oxygen Evolution Measurements—Oxygen evolution was measured at 25 °C by polarography using a Clark-type oxygen electrode with saturating white light. Oxygen evolution of cells (20 μg of Chl ml–1), thylakoid membranes (20 μg of Chl ml–1), and PSII core complexes (5 μg of Chl ml–1) was measured in 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 m glycinebetaine, and in the presence of 0.5 mm DCBQ (2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, dissolved in ethanol) as electron acceptor. The amount of oxygen produced per flash during a sequence of saturating flashes was measured at room temperature with a lab-made rate electrode equivalent to that described in (22Miyao M. Murata N. Lavorel J. Maison B. Boussac A. Etienne A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 151-159Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The short saturating flashes were produced by a xenon flash. The time between flashes was 400 ms. 20 μl of a thylakoid membrane suspension (1 mg of Chl·ml–1) in a buffer containing 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 m glycinebetaine were deposited onto the surface of the platinum electrode and dark adapted for 40 min at room temperature prior to each flash sequence. The analysis of the flash-induced oxygen evolution patterns was done as described in Ref. 23Boussac A. Rappaport F. Carrier P. Verbavatz J-M. Gobin R. Kirilovsky D. Rutherford A.W. Sugiura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22809-22819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar. EPR Measurements—CW-EPR spectra were recorded using a standard ER 4102 (Bruker) X-band resonator with a Bruker ESP300 X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments cryostat (ESR 900). The samples were frozen in the dark to 198 K, degassed at 198 K, and then transferred to 77 K. Determination of g-values was done using an ER032M gaussmeter (Bruker). Illumination of the samples was done with an 800 watt tungsten lamp, in a non-silvered Dewar filled with liquid nitrogen. Light was filtered through water and IR filters. To calculate the PS II/PS I ratio, first an EPR spectrum of Tyr D· was recorded using a dark-adapted sample. A second EPR spectrum was recorded after one flash in the presence of ferricyanide (in order to oxidize all the Tyr D and the P700+). Then the Tyr D· signal was removed from the spectrum by interactive subtraction to obtain the P700 and Tyr D· signals separately. Interactive subtraction is a standard computer-assisted spectrum manipulation in which an unknown spectral component can be extracted from a mixture of two spectra by subtracting a proportion of a second known spectral component. The proportion of the known spectral component in the mixture is gradually varied until the difference spectrum is considered to contain no contribution from the known spectrum. Redox Potential Measurements—Reductive Potentiometric redox titrations were carried out basically as described in Ref. 14Roncel M. Boussac A. Zurita J.L. Bottin H. Sugiura M. Kirilovsky D. Ortega J.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. The electrode was calibrated before each titration against a saturated solution of quinhydrone (E′m = +280 mV at 20 °C, pH 7). All redox measurements are relative to normal hydrogen electrode. For titration, samples contained PS II core complexes (30–50 μg of Chl ml–1) or purified cyt c550 (about 0.5–1 μm) were suspended in a buffer containing 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 m glycinebetaine. The buffer for the titrations of purified H92C and H92M cyt c550 contained 10 mm sodium ascorbate. To ensure a good equilibrium between the redox centers and the electrode, a set of suitable redox mediators were added (14Roncel M. Boussac A. Zurita J.L. Bottin H. Sugiura M. Kirilovsky D. Ortega J.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar):20 μm duroquinone (E′m, pH 7 = +10 mV), 30 μm 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (E′m, pH 7 = 0 mV), 30 μm 2,5-dihydroxyl-p-naphthoquinone (E′m, pH 7 = –60 mV), 30 μm anthraquinone (E′m, pH 7 = –100 mV), 30 μm 2-hydroxyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (E′m, pH 7 = –145 mV), 30 μm anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate (E′m, pH 7 = –170 mV), 30 μm anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (E′m, pH 7 = –185 mV) and 30 μm anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (E′m, pH 7 = –225 mV), 30 μm benzyl viologen (1,1′-dibenzyl-4,4′-bipyridylium dichloride) (E′m, pH 7 = –311 mV) and 30 μm methyl viologen (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridylium dichloride) (E′m, pH 7 = –430 mV). In order to calculate E′m values of cyt c550 in PSII core complexes, differential spectra were obtained by subtracting the absolute spectra recorded at each solution redox potential during titrations from the spectra of the fully oxidized state of the cytochrome (at a solution redox potential of about +100 mV). The absorbance differences at 549–560 nm (for ΔpsbV2 mutant) and 552–560 nm (for His-92 mutants) obtained from difference (PSII core complexes) or absolute spectra (purified cyt c550) were normally converted into percentages of reduced cytochrome and plotted versus solution redox potential. E′m values were then determined by fitting percentages plots to an n = 1 Nernst equation curve using a non-linear curve-fitting program (Origin 6.0, Microcal Software). Oxidative redox titrations were carried out as controls in order to check for the reproducibility of the experiments; no significant hysteresis effects were observed. Thermoluminescence—Thermoluminescence was measured as described in (24Ducruet J-M. J. of Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 2419-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes at a Chl concentration of 100 μg ml–1 and PS II complexes at 35 μgml–1 were dark-adapted (at least for half an hour). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in a 40 mm MES (pH 6.5) buffer containing 15 mm MgCl, 15 mm CaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 m glycinebetaine at a Chl concentration of 100 μg ml–1. After dark adaptation (15 min), the cells were frozen at –80 °C. They were maintained for half an hour at –80 °C. After slow thawing, the cell suspension was incubated on ice in darkness. For measurements of S2Q–B and S3Q–B recombination, the samples were incubated for 5 min in the dark at 20 (isolated PS II) or 40 °C (thylakoids and cells) and then flashed one to four times at 1 °C. For measurements of S2Q–A recombination, the dark-adapted samples were flashed once in the presence of DCMU at 20 °C and after 3 min of dark adaptation, one flash was given at –5 °C. For luminescence detection, the samples were warmed at a constant rate (0.5 °C/s) from 1 °C or –5 °C to 80 °C. Construction of Gene-interrupted and Site-directed Mutants—To generate mutants of T. elongatus lacking either the cyt c550 or the PsbV2 protein, the genome region containing the genes coding for these proteins (Fig. 1A) was amplified by PCR and cloned. Plasmids were constructed in which either the psbV1 or the psbV2 gene was interrupted by insertion of a spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1, B and C). The plasmids carrying the site-directed mutations H92M-psbV1 and H92C-psbV1 were constructed using the plasmid in which the psbV2 gene had been previously interrupted. Thus, the PsbV2 protein was absent in these mutants. The plasmids were introduced into H-43 T. elongatus cells by electroporation and the interrupted psbV2 and point-mutated psbV1 genes were incorporated into the cyanobacterium genome by homologous double recombination. The construction allowed us to perform mutant selection by growing the cells in the presence of antibiotics. Complete segregation and homoplasmicity of the mutants were tested by PCR analysis. Fig 1E shows that amplification of the genomic region containing the psbV1 and psbV2 genes using the synthetic oligonucleotides psV1 and psV2 gave a fragment of 3.5 kb in all the mutants containing the Sp/Sm cassette (2.1 kb) instead of a 1.5 kb fragment as was observed in the H-43j T. elongatus strain. No traces of the 1.5 kb PCR fragment were detected in these mutants indicating that complete segregation and total homoplasmicity were achieved in mutant cells. The digestion pattern obtained with the restriction enzyme ApaLI of the 3.5-kb fragment confirmed that the Sp/Sm resistance cassette was incorporated in the BsaAI site of the psbV1 gene in the psbV1-disruptant mutant and in the BstAPI site of psbV2 in the psbV2-disruptant mutant (Fig. 1, D and F). Since the double recombination could occur between the antibiotic cassette and the point mutations, not all the Sp/Sm resistant mutants contained the site-directed mutations. To select the mutants carrying the proper modified bases, a 1-kb PCR fragment obtained using the psV0 and psV6 oligonucleotides as primers and containing the psbV1 gene was checked by digestion with the restriction enzyme ApaLI. In the absence of a point mutation, the fragment was digested giving two fragments of 0.8 and 0.2 kb (Fig. 1G). The smaller fragment is visible only on overloaded gels (data not shown). With the correct mutation, the amplified DNA fragments lost the restriction site, and no digestion occurred (Fig. 1G). Sequencing of the PCR-amplified fragment confirmed the presence of the proper mutation (data not shown). These PCR analyses were regularly repeated to verify the genotype in the cells used for phenotype characterization. For simplicity, the psbV2-disruptant mutant, lacking the PsbV2 protein, but presenting a phenotype similar to the wild type is called the control strain; the psbV1-disruptant mutant, lacking the cyt c550, is called the cyt c550-less mutant; the ΔpsbV2/H92M-psbV1 and ΔpsbV2/H92C-psbV1 mutants is called H92M and H92C, respectively. Mutant Cell Growth—The photosynthetic growth rates of control cells and H92M, H92C, and cyt c550-less mutant cells at 45 °C and 80 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 were similar (Fig. 2A). The doubling time was about 20 h for the four strains. The T. elongatus cyt c550-less mutant cells were unable to grow in DTN medium lacking Cl– (Fig. 2B). Control, H92M, and H92C cells, however, were able to grow in the chloride-depleted culture medium albeit at slower rate (doubling time ≈35–37 h). In Ca2+-depleted medium, T. elongatus wild type cells only doubled their initial concentration before they completely stopped growing (Fig. 2B and Ref. 27Satoh K. Katoh S. Takamiya A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1972; 13: 885-897Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The control, H92M and H92C cells presented the same behavior as the wild type cells whereas cyt c550-less mutant cells did not grow at all (Fig. 2B). Oxygen Evolution Activity—The H92M, H92C, and control cells had similar oxygen evolving activities (250–300 μmol of O2·(mg Chl)–1·h–1) while the activity was significantly lower in the cyt c550-less mutant cells (150–200 μmol of O2·(mg Chl)–1·h–1). We measured the oxygen evolution activity under different light intensities in control and cyt c550-less mutant cells. By plotting the data as the activity versus activity/light intensity (Fig. 3) (25Lumry R. Rieske J.S. Plant Physiol. 1959; 34: 301-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rieske J.S. Lumry R. Spikes J.D. Plant Physiol. 1959; 34: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Satoh K. Katoh S. Takamiya A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1972; 13: 885-897Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), straight parallel lines were obtained indicating that the number of active PS II reaction centers decreased in cyt c550-less mutant cells compared with control cells. EPR measurements (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that the ratio PS I to total PS II was about 2.5–3 in the four strains (data not shown). The oxygen-evolving activity in H92M and control thylakoids was similar to that measured in whole cells (240–270 μmol O2·(mg Chl)–1·h–1), while in cyt c550-less and H92C thylakoids the activity decreased to 160–200 and 100–130 μmol of O2·(mg Chl)–1·h–1, respectively. Thus, the activity of H92C thylakoids represented 60–75% of the activity of control thylakoids, and the activity of cyt c550-less thylakoids was only 40–48% of control.

Here, we determined the solution structure of this domain by using NMR. It consisted of one α-helix and five β-strands, showing novel features distinct from previously determined zinc-binding structures. We created point mutants of TFIIEα in this domain and examined their binding abilities to other general transcription factors as well as their transcription activities. Four Zn2+-ligand mutants, in which each of cysteine residues at positions 129, 132, 154, and 157 was replaced by alanine, possessed no transcription activities on a linearized template, whereas, on a supercoiled template, interesting functional asymmetry was observed: although the C-terminal two mutants abolished transcription activity (<5%), the N-terminal two mutants retained about 20% activities. The N-terminal two mutants bound stronger to the small subunit of TFIIF than the wild type and the C-terminal two mutants were impaired in their binding abilities to the XPB subunits of TFIIH. These suggest that the structural integrity of the zinc finger domain is essential for the TFIIE function, particularly in the transition from the transcription initiation to elongation and the conformational tuning of this domain for appropriate positioning of TFIIF, TFIIH, and polymerase II would be needed depending on the situation and timing.

There TFIIE conducts pol II to sit at the initiation site, makes pol II processive upon C-terminal domain phosphorylation by stimulating C-terminal domain kinase activity of TFIIH, and simultaneously assists a helicase subunit XPB of TFIIH to start melting at the -10 position. At the transition from initiation to elongation, TFIIE also plays a direct role in promoter clearance by regulating kinase and DNA helicase activities of TFIIH (6Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).Human TFIIE (hTFIIE) is a heterotetramer consisting of two α (hTFIIEα; 57 kDa, 439 aa) and two β (hTFIIEβ; 34 kDa, 291 amino acids) subunits (10Ohkuma Y.

Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both subunits possess several structural motifs and characteristic sequences. Although hTFIIE has been functionally characterized, little is known about its structure, especially on hTFIIEα (14Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Okamoto T. Yamamoto S. Watanabe Y. Ohta T. Hanaoka F. Roeder R.G. Ohkuma Y. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1346-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Main reason is its low solubility. Although high concentration of protein sample should be prepared for the structural studies, each hTFIIE subunit aggregates and precipitates at the concentration higher than 10 mg/ml. Thus we have been focusing on dissecting functional domains in each subunit. To identify core regions in hTFIIEα, limited proteolyses were performed and a highly conserved region (residues 113–174) containing a zinc finger motif, which is essential for transcription activity of TFIIE (14Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Maxon M.E. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9529-9533Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was isolated (Fig. 1). In this study, we have determined the solution structure of this core domain (hTFIIEαc) of hTFIIEα by NMR and provided insight into its role for the TFIIE function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of hTFIIEαc Expression Plasmid—For subcloning the nucleotide sequence of the hTFIIEαc corresponding to the amino acid residues 113–174 into a bacterial expression vector, the oligonucleotide ES1T (5′-GTGTACCATATGAGAATTGAGACCGATGAGAGAG-3′) was designed to create an NdeI site (underlined) and to add the methionine codon before the R113 residue and the nucleotide ES1B (5′-GAACGGGATCCTCAGCGTGCATCTTTTTTGGGCATTGC-3′) was designed to create a BamHI site (underlined) right after the stop codon (bold letters). This nucleotide fragment was amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides and the p2EA plasmid containing the complete open reading frame of human TFIIEα (hTFIIEα cDNA) as a template (11Ohkuma Y. Sumimoto H. Hoffmann A. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), digested with NdeI and BamHI, and subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of the pBluescript SK(-). The nucleotide sequences of the cloned PCR products were confirmed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The NdeI-BamHI fragment of hTFIIEαc cDNA was then subcloned into the pET11d vector (Novagen) to construct the N-terminal six histidine (His6)-tagged hTFIIEαc (6His-hTFIIEαc) expression plasmid.Purification of hTFIIEαc—The hTFIIEαc plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB or in M9 minimal media containing [15N]ammonium chloride with or without [13C]glucose. 6His-hTFIIEαc was then induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4–7 h growth the cells were harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 30 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine) containing 100 mm NaCl (BA100). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen) column, equilibrated with BA100 containing 20 mm imidazole-HCl. The sample was eluted by linear gradient from 20 to 350 mm imidazole-HCl. The peak fractions were pooled, and the buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 30 μm ZnCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2 containing 150 mm NaCl. The sample was digested with thrombin for 16 h at 25 °C to remove the His6 tag, then, loaded onto the Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 30 μm ZnCl2) containing 200 mm NaCl. hTFIIEαc was passed over the column, concentrated using Centriprep (Amicon) and applied onto Superdex30 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 30 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol) containing 50 mm NaCl. The final fractions were used for analyses.NMR Spectroscopy—Protein concentration for NMR experiments is about 3–4 mm in the buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 30 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm deuterated 1,4-dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl) dissolved in either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 99.9% D2O. All NMR experiments were carried out at 32 °C on either Bruker DRX-500, DRX-600, AVANCE-500, or AVANCE-600 spectrometer. Backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned using the following experiments: CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, HN(CA)CO, HNCO, DQF-COSY, TOCSY, HBHA(CO)NH, 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY (18Cavanagh J.

Distance information was obtained from NOESY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional 15N,15N-edited HSQC-NOESY-HSQC, four-dimensional 15N,15N-edited HSQC-NOESY-HSQC, four-dimensional 13C,15N-edited HSQC-NOESY-HSQC and four-dimensional 13C,13C-edited HSQC-NOESY-HSQC (18Cavanagh J.

Fairbroher W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Side-chain torsion angles χ1 and χ2 were obtained from a combination of HNHB, HN(CO)HB, HNCG, and HN(CO)CG (21Krichna N.R. Berliner L.J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 16. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1998Google Scholar) and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (18Cavanagh J. Fairbroher W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J.

Rosen M.K. Patel D.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to detect trans-hydrogen bond 3hJNC′ couplings. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the programs PIPP, CAPP, and STAPP (24Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar) and NMRView (25Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). NMR relaxation rates for amide nitrogens of hTFIIEαc were measured according to the procedure described previously (26Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). The 15N T1 data were collected using 15N delays of 24, 64, 128, 256, 384, 512, 1024, 1536, and 2048 ms. The 15N T2 data were collected using 15N delays of 16.2, 32.3, 48.5, 64.6, 129.3, 193.9, 258.6, 387.8, and 517.1 ms. The steady-state {1H}-15N NOEs data were measured by taking the ratio of the peak intensities from experiments performed with and without application of 1H saturation.Structure Calculation—Interproton distance restraints derived from NOE intensities were grouped into three distance ranges, 1.8–2.7 Å (1.8–2.9 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), 1.8–3.3 Å (1.8–3.5 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), and 1.8–5.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively. The upper limit was corrected for constraints involving methyl groups, aromatic ring protons, and nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons. Dihedral angle restraints for φ were set to -90° < φ < -40° for 3JHNα < 6.0 Hz and -160° < φ < -80° for 3JHNα > 8.0 Hz, based on the short range NOEs and backbone chemical shifts. χ1 angles were restrained ±30° for three side-chain rotamers. The zinc was constrained to be tetrahedrally coordinated by four cysteines as follows. Zn–Sγ bond length sets to 2.3 Å, Zn-Sγ-Cβ and Sγ-Zn-Sγ angles set to 108° and 109°. Hydrogen bond restraints in areas of regular secondary structure were introduced at the final stages of refinement. Structure calculations were performed by the distance geometry and simulated annealing using program X-PLOR (27Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A total of 100 structures were calculated, and 69 structures had no NOE violations larger than 0.2 Å and no dihedral angle violations greater than 1°. Structural statistics for the 20 best structures are summarized in Table I. Structures were analyzed and displayed using PROCHECK-NMR (28Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R.

Hayashi K. Tanaka A. Furumoto T. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2914-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A restriction enzyme site was placed in an oligonucleotide to select for properly mutated plasmids as described elsewhere, and the mutants were then checked by sequencing using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The oligonucleotides used for mutation were listed in Table II. Created enzyme sites were underlined, and the enzyme names were written in parentheses. Mutated sequences are written in bold, and each mutated codon is boxed. For three oligonucleotides creating C157A, D164A, and D164K, restriction enzyme sites were not created and mutated sequences were directly checked by sequencing. The NdeI-BamHI fragment of mutated hTFIIEα cDNA was then subcloned into the pET11d vector (Novagen) to construct the N-terminal His6-tagged hTFIIEα (6 His-hTFIIEα) expression plasmid.Table IIOligonucleotide sequences used for point mutationsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant point mutant hTFIIEα proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. For general purification, soluble bacterial lysates containing with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm NaCl) were used. For miniscale preparations, lysates (1 ml) representing 25 ml of culture were mixed 100 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen), and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin samples were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer D500 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm KCl) containing 10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.9), and washed twice with 1 ml of BD500 containing 40 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.9). Bound proteins were eluted twice with 300 μl of BD500 containing 100 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.9). Typical preparations were >80% pure judging by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel.In Vitro Transcription Assays—Recombinant general transcription factors as well as native pol II and TFIIH were purified as described previously (31Watanabe T. Hayashi K. Tanaka A. Furumoto T. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2914-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription with either a supercoiled or a linearized template was carried out with increasing amounts (12 and 24 ng) of wild type or mutant hTFIIEα proteins. The plasmid pML(C2AT)Δ-50, which contains the adenovirus 2 major late promoter and gives a 390-nucleotide transcript, was used as a template (31Watanabe T. Hayashi K. Tanaka A. Furumoto T. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2914-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To prepare the linearized template, pML(C2AT)Δ-50 was digested with SmaI. After transcription, radiolabeled transcripts were subjected to urea-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The transcripts were quantified by a Fuji BAS2500 Bio-Imaging analyzer. Relative transcription activities of the mutant hTFIIEα proteins were calculated by defining the transcription activity of 24 ng of wild type hTFIIEα as 100%.GST-Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were performed as previously described (31Watanabe T. Hayashi K. Tanaka A. Furumoto T. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2914-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-hTFIIEα mouse monoclonal antibody (1:8,000 dilution) (Medical Biology Laboratory). Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using RX-U film (Fuji Film).RESULTSIdentification of the Core Domain of hTFIIEα—TFIIEα is highly conserved among eukaryotes. In addition, TFE from archaea has recently been found to be a homolog of the N-terminal half of hTFIIEα (32Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To identify the structural domain, the recombinant hTFIIEα was digested by limited proteolysis. Three structural domains consisting of the amino acid residues 113–174, 276–323, and 283–323 and two structural domains consisting of the amino acid residues 106–188 and 302–342 were identified by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestions, respectively, followed by mass spectrometries. Finally, a central core domain (hTFIIEαc) was identified to consist of the amino acid residues 113–174 containing a putative zinc finger motif (Fig. 1) (11Ohkuma Y. Sumimoto H. Hoffmann A. Shimasaki S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 6His-hTFIIEαc was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, purified, and subjected to conventional multidimensional NMR measurements.Overview of the Core Domain Structure—Almost all signals for each amino acid of hTFIIEαc could be assigned except for the β protons of the N-terminal Arg-113. The hTFIIEαc has the compact structure consisting of one short α-helix and five β-strands (Fig. 2, A and B); S1 strand (residues 126–129), t1 turn (residues 130–133), S2 strand (residues 134–136), α-helix (residues 138–144), S3 strand (residues 145–146), loop (residues 147–150), S4 strand (residues 151–154), t2 turn (residues 155–158), and S5 strand (residues 159–164). The three β-strands (S1, S2, and C-terminal half of S5) and the other three β-strands (S3, S4, and N-terminal half of S5) form antiparallel β-sheets. Fig. 2C shows that two β-sheets separated by the α-helix are symmetrical, including the positions of cysteine residues in the topology diagram. Zn2+ coordinates to Cys-129 and Cys-132 in the t1 turn and Cys-154 and Cys-157 in the t2 turn. The H-D exchange rates of amide protons of Val-131, Cys-132, Phe-156, and Cys-157 were found to be relatively slow. Judging from the structure, hydrogen bonds could be formed in Cys-129:Sγ-Val-131:HN, -Cys-132:HN and Cys-154: Sγ-Phe-156:HN, -Cys-157:HN, respectively (Fig. 2D). These bifurcating hydrogen bonds are consistent with the hydrogen bond pattern between Sγ of i residue and HN of i+2, i+3 residues observed in many zing finger domains (35Qian X. Gozani S.N. Yoon H. Jeon C. Agarwal K. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9944-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Zhu W. Zeng Q. Colangelo C.M. Lewis L.M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct.

In the H-D exchange experiment almost all of amide protons were exchanged with deuterium within 40 min, so that little hydrogen bond information was obtained. We could directly observe more hydrogen bonds in the β-sheets by measuring transhydrogen bond 3hJNC′ couplings (39Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Fig. S4).Fig. 2The hTFIIEαc structure. A, the superposition of a family of the final 20 NMR structures.

Fig. 2E shows that a hydrophobic core is formed by hydrophobic amino acids: Ala-141, Leu-144, and Val-161 as well as five phenylalanine residues that are piled up each other and arranged like a capital character, L. This aromatic-aromatic interaction network seems to contribute significantly to the stability of the structure. These residues are well conserved among species (Fig. 1). Electrostatic potential on the molecular surface shows that the hTFIIEαc has a negative potential cluster, which is formed by conserved Asp-138, Glu-160, Glu-162, Glu-163, Asp-164, and Glu-165, and is extensively located on a concave surface opposite to the zinc-binding site (Fig. 2F).N-terminal and C-terminal regions were disordered due to poor distance restraints. Nevertheless only about 40 amino acids can architect the rigid structure. Actually, 15N-T1,T2, and 15N–{1H}heteronuclear NOE values revealed flexibility of backbone in the N-terminal 13 and C-terminal 11 residues (Fig. 3).Fig. 3NMR relaxation analysis of the hTFIIEαc.15N-T1, T2, and heteronuclear 1H-{15N} NOE values are plotted for each residue in top, middle, and bottom panels, respectively. All spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer at 32 °C under the same solution conditions as for the structure determination. The absence of a bar is due to the overlapping of amide peaks.

https://openalex.org/W2039519914,"The relative scarcity of inclusion-affected muscle cells or markers of cell death in inclusion body myositis (IBM) is in distinction to the specific and early intracellular deposition of several Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related proteins. The current study examined the possible correlation between myotube β-amyloid and/or Tau accumulations and a widespread mishandling of intracellular muscle calcium concentration that could potentially account for the unrelenting weakness in affected patients. Cultured myogenic cells (C2C12) expressed β-amyloid-42 (Aβ42) and fetal Tau peptides, as human transgenes encoded by herpes simplex virus, either individually or concurrently. Co-expression of Aβ42 in C2C12 myotubes resulted in hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein that was not observed when Tau was expressed alone. Resting calcium concentration and agonist-induced RyR-mediated Ca2+ release were examined using calcium-specific microelectrodes and Fluo-4 epifluorescence, respectively. Co-expression of Aβ42 and Tau cooperatively elevated basal levels of myoplasmic-free calcium, an effect that was accompanied by depolarization of the plasma membrane. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release, induced by KCl depolarization, was not affected by Aβ42 or Tau. In contrast, expression of Aβ42, Tau, or Aβ42 together with Tau resulted in enhanced sensitivity of ryanodine receptors to activation by caffeine. Notably, expression of β-amyloid, alone, was sufficient to result in an increased sensitivity to direct activation by caffeine. Current results indicate that amyloid proteins cooperate to raise resting calcium levels and that these effects are associated with a passive SR Ca2+ leak and Tau hyperphosphorylation in skeletal muscle. The relative scarcity of inclusion-affected muscle cells or markers of cell death in inclusion body myositis (IBM) is in distinction to the specific and early intracellular deposition of several Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related proteins. The current study examined the possible correlation between myotube β-amyloid and/or Tau accumulations and a widespread mishandling of intracellular muscle calcium concentration that could potentially account for the unrelenting weakness in affected patients. Cultured myogenic cells (C2C12) expressed β-amyloid-42 (Aβ42) and fetal Tau peptides, as human transgenes encoded by herpes simplex virus, either individually or concurrently. Co-expression of Aβ42 in C2C12 myotubes resulted in hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein that was not observed when Tau was expressed alone.

Current results indicate that amyloid proteins cooperate to raise resting calcium levels and that these effects are associated with a passive SR Ca2+ leak and Tau hyperphosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Both cortical neurons and skeletal muscle are electrically specialized, post-mitotic tissues endowed with cholinergic synapses and internal calcium release channels and are uniquely disordered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; HSV, herpes simplex virus; Aβ(42), β-amyloid peptide (42 amino acid form); HFT, human fetal Tau; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; RyR, ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; IBM, inclusion body myositis; moi, multiplicity of infection; PM, plasma membrane; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; τ, Tau.1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; HSV, herpes simplex virus; Aβ(42), β-amyloid peptide (42 amino acid form); HFT, human fetal Tau; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; RyR, ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; IBM, inclusion body myositis; moi, multiplicity of infection; PM, plasma membrane; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; τ, Tau. and inclusion body myositis (IBM), respectively. Deposits of AD-associated proteins, such as β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), hyperphosphorylated Tau, and other shared misfolded proteins, such as, β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), ubiquitin, as well as various chaperones and kinases are thought to play pathologic roles in the cognitive decline (1Selkoe D. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar) and muscular failure (2Askanas V. Engel W. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2002; 15: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which define these incurable human conditions. Ca2+ ions play essential roles in numerous cellular processes. The release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores and the influx of Ca2+ through the surface membrane ion channels and transporters are critical to both memory formation and contraction in their cognate tissues (3Bliss T. Collinridge G. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar). The prolonged elevation of cellular Ca2+ has been shown to be deleterious to neuronal and muscle function (4Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There is an extensive literature base devoted to the concept that neural calcium dyshomeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (5Nixon R. Saito K. Grynspan F. Griffin W. Katayama S. Honda T. Mohan P. Shea T. Beermann M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6LaFerla F. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). As pertains to the β-amyloid hypothesis, published results indicate that application of Aβ42 peptide potentiates excitotoxic mechanisms through oxidative damage, increase in Ca2+ influx and reduction of Ca2+ removal (7Hartmann H. Eckert A. Muller W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Mattson M. Barger S. Cheng B. Lieberburg I. Swintosky V. Rydel R. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). These alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis could be linked to inhibition of numerous intracellular and plasma membrane ion-motive ATPases (9Mark R. Hensley K. Butterfield A. Mattson M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6239-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or it could arise from the ability of Aβ to form selective calcium permeant pores with conductances following electrochemical gradients (10Arispe N. Pollard H. Rojas E. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1994; 140: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Calcium dysregulation may also involve aberrant storage or release of calcium from internal stores involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its calcium release channels (11Guo G. Sopher B. Pham D. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G. Mattson M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mattson M. LaFerla F. Chan S. Leissring M. Shepel N. Geiger J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been supported by correlation of the changes in [3H]ryanodine binding, with the load of both neurofibrillary and Aβ pathologies in AD entorhinal/hippocampal cortex (13Kelliher M. Fastbom J. Cowburn R. Bonkale W. Ohm T. Ravid R. Sorrentino V. O'Neill C. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting an alteration of activity of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels (RyR). One possible mechanism for AD progression is governed by a pathologic cycle of Ca2+ dysregulation and cell damage, whereby, the effect (increased [Ca2+]) can reciprocate to further enhance the cause (Aβ production) (14Querfurth H.W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4450-4561Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B.

The etiology of IBM is unknown. While sporadic IBM is clearly an inflammatory condition for which evidence exists to support an immune basis, there are also unique clinical and pathological features pointing to a primary degenerative cause (17Tawil R. Griggs R. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). IBM disorder shares several common features with the AD. In IBM, intracellular inclusions bearing AD-associated proteins (rimmed vacuoles) occur in scattered, non-necrotic, atrophic, angulated myofibers (18Askanas V. Engel W. Askanas V. Serratrice G. Engel W. Inclusion Body Myositis and Myopathies. Cambridge University Press, UK1998: 3-78Google Scholar). Their sparse occurrence, however, make it likely that clinical muscle weakness arises from a more widespread or generalized metabolic defect, for instance related to oxidative stress (19Askanas V. Engel W. Arch. Neurol. 1998; 55: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that can possibly lead to mitochondrial failure, calcium dyshomeostasis and/or a disorder of filament function and cytoskeletal protein interactions. Calcium dysregulation for example, could be limited to myofibers affected with inclusions or also involve normal appearing myofibers, which harbor undetectable but nevertheless toxic levels of intracellular soluble oligomeric β-amyloid species (see Ref. 20Walsh D. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J. Rowan M. Selkoe D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Most of the previous work in the field of Ca2+ dysregulation in AD has utilized numerous mutant presenilin (PS)-based models. The introduction of PS-1 mutations into cultured neuronal cells, has been shown to increase the levels of expression of the RyR that lead to a potentiation of caffeine-induced calcium release (21Chan S. Mayne M. Holden C. Geiger J. Mattson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and heightened sensitivity to the application of Aβ peptides and other injurious stimuli, resulting in enhanced apoptosis (21Chan S. Mayne M. Holden C. Geiger J. Mattson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 22Mattson M. Zhu H. Yu J. Kindy M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1358-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of abnormal Ca2+ signaling in cells harboring presenilin mutations has been shown to involve an overload of ER Ca2+ stores (22Mattson M. Zhu H. Yu J. Kindy M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1358-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Leissring M. Akbari Y. Fanger C. Cahalan M. Mattson M. LaFerla F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Leissring M. LaFerla F. Callamaras N. Parker I. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has also been found that the C-terminal domain of βAPP (AICD) has nuclear transcriptional activities and modulates calcium handling, suggesting that a signal transduction mechanism underlies the buildup of ER calcium stores (25Leissring M. Murphy M. Mead T. Akbari Y. Sugarman M. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Muller U. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Wolfe M. Golde T. LaFerla F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, unresolved issues with this approach include the specific role of Aβ42 levels and the possible extent to which RyR-mediated Ca2+ release is altered. To date, little attention has been given to the possibility that dysregulation of intracellular calcium in diseased skeletal myofibers may have a significant role in IBM pathogenesis. Since the pathogenesis of AD and IBM share several hallmarks, and neuronal and skeletal muscle have some functional similarities, IBM could serve as a suitable model for studying the effects Aβ and Tau proteins as they pertain to development of AD. In the current study we utilized this model to study Ca2+ dysregulation in response to direct overexpression of exogenous β-amyloid and Tau peptides in skeletal muscle myotubes. The results of this study indicate that in addition to significant depolarization of the plasma membrane, the resting intracellular Ca2+ levels in AD protein-expressing muscle cells were significantly elevated. This finding was associated with the enhancement of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR); supporting the concept that chronic degeneration in IBM may represent a decline in non-activity dependent muscle function. It was also examined whether depolarization-induced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cultured skeletal muscle cells was affected in a way that could account for the elevation in basal Ca2+ levels. Herpes Simplex Virus Synthesis—β-amyloid 42 and the fetal isoform (0N3R) of human Tau (HFT) sequences were cloned into a Herpes simplex virus amplicon for expression in muscle cells. A 17 amino acid signal peptide ER localization sequence of β-amyloid precursor protein precedes the Aβ42 sequence, as previously reported (26Querfurth H. Suhara T. Rosen K. McPhie D. Fujio Y. Tejada G. Neve R. Adelman L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 793-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Tau sequence was digested from the pBR322-based p19 Tau plasmid (27Lee G. Neve R.L. Kosik K.S. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1615-1624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and inserted into pHSV-PrPUC (gift from R. Neve, McLean Hospital, Boston, MA) as shown in Fig. 1A. The amplicons were transfected into Vero cells with LipofectAMINE plus. Sixteen hours after transfection 1 × 106 plaque-forming units of α8 helper strain were added, and Herpes viruses were subjected to three rounds of amplification. Viral particles were purified on a sucrose gradient according to Ref. 28Neve R. Lim F. Current Protocols in Neuroscience. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999: 4.12.1-4.12.7Google Scholar. Titers ranged from 2.4 × 107 to 1.5 × 108 for HSV-Aβ42 and 4.3 to 5.3 × 107 for HSV-HFT. Control Herpes amplicon coding for β-galactosidase (HSV-LacZ) was described (26Querfurth H. Suhara T. Rosen K. McPhie D. Fujio Y. Tejada G. Neve R. Adelman L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 793-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cell Culture Conditions—C2C12 cells were expanded in growth medium, which consisted of Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Upon reaching full confluency, growth medium was replaced with differentiation media, which consisted of DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated horse serum. The cells were differentiated for 3–7 days, until most of the myocytes had fused, and infected with either 0.7 multiplicity of infection (moi) HSV-sigAβ42 or 0.2 moi HSV-HFT or both. From previous work, similar moi resulted in maximal transgene expression without cell loss at the viral exposure times used for Western analysis (see below). Control cells were infected with 0.9 moi of HSV-LacZ. Viral load was always equalized between treatments by the addition of the appropriate amounts of HSV-LacZ. Cells were continuously exposed to virus for 9 or 21 h following infection, depending on the type of experiment, and prior to harvesting for Western blot (21 h), fixation for immunostaining (9 h), or loading for Ca2+ imaging (9 h). Western Blot Analysis—2 × 105 cells were harvested 21 h after being infected with the herpes simplex viral constructs. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and one protease inhibitor mixture tablet/50 ml (Roche Applied Science). Cells were immediately scraped from each well, incubated on ice for 20 min, vortexed, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and frozen at -80 °C until analyzed for protein content using the Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine IgG for the standards. 12.5 μg of total protein was separated on a 4–12% Bis/Tris SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. PVDF membranes were washed once in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween-20 (TBST), pretreated with 15% H202 for 15 min and followed by 6 × 5 min washes. Blocking took place in TBST containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5% nonfat milk for 45 min at 25 °C. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The following day membranes were washed three times for 10 min in TBST, followed by 45 min of incubation with secondary antibody (e.g. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:1000) in TBST at 25 °C. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min in TBST before signal detection by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). For multiple detections, membranes were stripped with sodium dodecyl sulfate and β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, and blocked in 5% nonfat milk before incubation with the next primary antibody. Primary antibodies (mc, monoclonal; rab, rabbit and dilutions; see Fig. 1B for numbering according to full-length Tau): PHF-1 (mc anti-Tau phosphoserine 396 and 404; 1:100), pS262 (rab anti-Tau phosphoserine; 1:200), and Tau-5 (mc anti-Tau non-phosphorylation-dependent; 1:100), 6E10 (mc 1:600), and cdk4 (rab 1:1000). Immunostaining of C2C12 Cells—Cells were grown in an 8-chamber slide to a density of 2 × 104 cells and were differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum for 2–4 days. The cells were infected with herpes simplex viruses as described above for 9 h. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer for 15 min at 25 °C. Each well was washed three times for 5 min prior to permeabilization with 3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min and further washed three times for 5 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubating with 10% normal goat serum in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with combinations of primary antibodies: mc anti-β-galactosidase 1:50 (Roche Applied Science), mc anti-Tau-5 1:50 (Signet), mc anti-6E10 1:100, rab anti-Tau phosphothreonine 231 1:100 (gift from Dr. Koichi Ishiguro), and/or rab R1282 1:300 (gift from Dr. Dennis Selkoe) in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The following day slides were washed three times for 5 min with PBS. The HSV-LacZ well was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed, and the color was developed by incubation in NBT. The other chambers were washed and incubated with either Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300) in 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min at 37 °C. Each chamber was washed three times for 5 min with PBS and mounted in N-propylgalate. Cells were visualized with a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed as described previously by (29Shtifman A. Paolini C. Lopez J. Allen P. Protasi F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C73-C78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). C2C12 myotubes were continuously infected with HSV particles bearing transgenes for 9 h. Prior to loading, differentiation media were removed, and myotubes were washed with the Ringer Solution containing in mm: 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 6 glucose, 25 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, pH 7.4. Solutions used for depolarization contained a constant product of NaCl and KCl at 130 mm. Cells were then loaded for 30 min in Ringer supplemented with Ca2+ indicator dye (Fluo-4AM, 5 μm). To terminate loading, myotubes were washed several times with the Ringer. Whole cell fluorescence changes were detected using PTI delta-RAM as the light source with a 12-bit digital intensified CCD (Stanford Photonics) interfaced with an inverted microscope equipped with an Olympus Uapo/340 ×40 oil immersion objective. Intracellular [Ca2+] transients were characterized as changes in Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity. All experiments were conducted in Ringer at room temperature (22 °C). Solution exchange within each well was achieved via pressure-controlled perfusion system (Automate Scientific Inc., Berkley, CA). Changes in fluorescence from the regions of interest within each cell were analyzed using QED imaging software (QED Software, Pittsburgh, PA). Membrane Potential and Resting [Ca2+]i Recording—Intracellular resting [Ca2+]i, and the plasma membrane potentials were recorded simultaneously using double-barreled Ca2+-selective microelectrodes that were prepared from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI PB150F-4, Sarasota, FL). Prior to pulling, all capillaries were washed with HCl followed by a rinse with distilled water and then dried at 150 °C for 3 h. Capillaries were pulled to make short taper microelectrodes with an outside tip diameter being ∼0.6 μm. The larger barrel (1.5-mm outside diameter) was silanized by exposure to dimethyldichlorosilane vapor. Twenty-four hours later the tip was backfilled with the neutral carrier ETH129 (Fluka, Ronkontioma, NY). The remainder of the barrel was backfilled with pCa7 solution 24 h later. The smaller barrel (0.84-mm outside diameter) was backfilled with 3 m KCl (tip resistance 10–15 ΩM). All Ca2+-selective microelectrodes were calibrated at 22 °C in solutions of known [Ca2+] (Lopez et al. 1983) before and after the Ca2+ measurements. To better mimic the intracellular ionic conditions all calibration solutions were supplemented with 1 mm Mg2+. Only those Ca2+ microelectrodes that provided a Nernstian response between pCa3 and pCa7 (29.5 mV/pCa unit at 22 °C) were used in this study. No more then 10 measurements were performed with each microelectrode. The potentials from the 3 m KCl barrel (Vm) and the Ca2+ barrel (VCa) were recorded via high impedance amplifier (WPI FD-223, Sarasota, FL). The Vm was subtracted electronically from VCae, to produce a differential Ca2+-specific potential (VCa) that represents the resting myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. The Vm and VCa potentials were filtered (30–50 KHz) to improve the signal to noise ratio. To assess the influence of Alzheimer's disease and IBM-associated proteins on skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis we examined the expression patterns of viral-encoded β-amyloid and Tau human transgene proteins, alone or in combination, as well as their effects on basal and stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ levels in differentiated murine C2C12 myotubes in culture. Western Blot Analysis and Immunocytochemistry—In Fig. 2A, β-amyloid expression was not detected in whole cell lysate from C2C12 myotubes that were either uninfected or infected with HSV-LacZ (lanes 2 and 3, respectively) or Tau alone (lane 5). Expression of monomeric, 4 kDa β-amyloid protein in C2C12 myotubes infected with either HSV-Aβ42 alone (lane 4) or in combination with HSV-human fetal Tau (HFT, lane 6) was readily detected with the 6E10 antibody. Additionally, cells that were infected with Aβ42 also exhibited formation of various soluble oligomeric species. HFT co-infection did not affect Aβ oligomerization. In analogous experiments using the phosphorylation-specific PHF-1 and anti-S262 and non-phosphorylation-dependent Tau-5 probes, endogenous Tau was not detected in soluble extracts from uninfected, cells infected with β-galactosidase (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) or with Aβ42 transgene alone (lane 4). When C2C12 cells were infected with Tau alone or in combination with Aβ42 an appearance of closely migrating bands was observed, ranging in molecular mass from ∼52 to 60 kDa (lanes 3 and 5). This is consistent with both, the transgene expression of the short Tau isoform (30Ishihara T. Hong M. Zhang B. Nakagawa Y. Lee M. Trojanowski J. Lee V. Neuron. 1999; 24: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and lack of endogenous “small Tau” expression in rat muscle fibers (31Gu Y. Oyama F. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 32Nagao S. Kumamoto T. Masuda T. Ueyama H. Toyoshima I. Tsuda T. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). When endogenous Tau degradation is inhibited, a complex of closely spaced bands, similar to ours, appears in rat muscle. These are regarded as various modifications of small Tau (33Murakami H. Oyama F. Gu Y. McLennan I. Nonaka I. Ihara Y. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tau appeared more highly phosphorylated at Ser262 in cells that were infected with both Tau and Aβ42 when compared with those infected with Tau alone (lanes 5 versus 3). PHF-1 reactivity, specific to phosphoepitopes in the flanking region C-terminal to the microtubule binding repeat domains, was also increased in Tau-positive cells that were also expressing Aβ (lane 5 versus 3). To examine cellular expression at times corresponding to physiological recordings below, differentiated C2C12 myotubes were infected with HSV particles encoding either LacZ, Tau, Aβ42, or simultaneously with HSV-Tau and HSV-Aβ42 (τAβ). Nine hours after control infections in expression time course experiments, ∼70–90% of the myotubes infected with HSV-LacZ stained positive for β-galactosidase (results not shown). The earliest morphological changes were observed in myotubes co-infected with Aβ and Tau. These changes consisted of rounding (Fig. 3, panel G) and granulovacuolarization (Fig. 3, panel J). Consistent with our previous studies (34Suhara T. Magrane J. Rosen K. Christensen R. Kim H.S. Zheng B. McPhie D.L. Walsh K. Querfurth H. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), exogenously expressed Aβ42 was retained intracellularly (Fig. 3, panels B, H, and K). When infected individually with HSV-Aβ42, or HSV-HFT, myotubes were positive for their cognate transgene (panels B and E, respectively), but were negative for the phosphorylated Thr231 Tau epitope (panels C and F). As expected, myotubes expressing only Tau showed no reactivity with Aβ-detecting antibodies (not shown). In co-infections, both transgenes were expressed (panels H and I). Only in co-infections was phosphorylation of Tau on Thr231 observed (panel L), indicating that the presence of Aβ had a hyperphosphorylating effect on Tau. Conversely, co-infections with Tau and Aβ showed a moderate decrease in the number and signal intensity of myotubes labeled using an antibody (Tau-1) specific for dephosphorylated Tau residues Ser198, Ser199, Ser202, and Thr205, relative to cells infected with Tau-encoding virus alone (data not shown). These results are also consistent with the complementary phosphorylation at Ser262 noted in Fig. 2. Tau, Aβ, and Tau+Aβ Alter Resting Membrane Potential and Resting [Ca2+]i—As demonstrated in Fig. 3, overexpression of AD-related proteins produced distinct alterations in the myotube morphology. Since C2C12 cells are excitable myogenic cells it is feasible that the observed alterations in the cellular morphology could be accompanied by changes in the resting membrane potential (Vm). Microelectrode recordings were conducted to determine if the PM of myotubes overexpressing either one of these proteins exhibited aberrant Vm with respect to the uninfected cells (Fig. 4). Fig. 4A shows representative membrane potential records of a myotube that was co-infected with Tau and β-amyloid (τAβ) and that which was not (NV). The impalement and the removal of the microelectrode were accompanied by a downward and an upward deflection, respectively. As described previously (35Iannaccone S. Li K. Sperelakis N. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) the Vm of the myotubes is typically in the range between -60 mV and -70 mV, which was confirmed in the uninfected cells (Fig. 4, A and B). As demonstrated by the upper record in Fig. 4A and in Fig. 4B, an overexpression of the τAβ was accompanied by a substantial depolarization of the plasma membrane (-52 + 1.9 mV). Similar to τAβ, overexpression of either Tau or Aβ alone also appeared to produce a depolarizing effect on the PM (Fig. 4B, records not shown). However, unlike in the presence of τAβ, the mean magnitude of depolarization was smaller in cells expressing individual Tau or Aβ proteins (Fig. 4B). Expression of β-galactosidase (HSV-LacZ) did not result in changes in Vm (-62 ± 0.74 mV). As described under “Materials and Methods,” the use of double barrel microelectrodes allows for simultaneous recording of the Vm and resting intracellular [Ca2+]i. Fig. 4C presents intracellular Ca2+ potential (VCa2+) records (see “Materials and Methods”) from the same two cells described in Fig."

All members of this transcription factor family play crucial roles as master regulators during development. GCMa is restricted to placenta during development and to kidney and thymus at postnatal stages. It is essential for the formation of the placental labyrinth and as a consequence for survival of the embryo from mid-embryogenesis onwards. Here, we identify Pitx transcription factors as GCMa-interacting proteins. We show that Pitx proteins interact via their conserved homeodomain with the DNA-binding domain of GCMa. As a consequence, Pitx proteins and GCMa exhibit cooperative DNA binding. Furthermore, Pitx proteins influence GCMa-dependent promoter activation in a cell-specific manner. One of the three Pitx paralogues in mice, Pitx2, is the predominant Pitx member present in the placenta and colocalizes on the cellular level with GCMa in the kidney. This is the first description of a regulatory cross-talk between a transcription factor of the GCM family and a homeodomain protein.

In the absence of placental GCMa expression, the allantois still fuses with the chorion, but subsequent steps of placental labyrinth formation are inhibited. The resulting failure to supply the embryo with nutrients and gases leads to lethality around E9.5 (11Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat.

Haas C.S. Amann K. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 118: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Renal expression of GCMa is turned on in neonatal mice and is restricted to the S3 segment of proximal tubules (18Hashemolhosseini S. Hadjihannas M. Stolt C.C. Haas C.S. Amann K. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 118: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GCMb knockout mice lack the parathyroid gland and suffer from partial neonatal lethality caused by defects in calcium and phosphate homeostasis (12Günther T. Chen Z.-F. Kim J. Priemel M. Rueger J.M.

Although the octameric binding motif (ATGCGGGT) of GCM proteins has been identified and its main biochemical properties have been thoroughly studied, up to now only two potential target gene promoters have been described for GCMa, namely aromatase and syncytin (1Schreiber J.

There are three Pitx paralogues in mice, which are highly conserved within their amino-terminally located homeodomain (>97% identity) and still well conserved over the whole remaining carboxyl-terminal length (55–70% identity). A short region near the carboxyl-terminal end has been termed OAR (Otx, Aristaless, Rex) and might modulate transactivation capacities or be involved in protein-protein interactions (28Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B.

Pitx1 is expressed in many tissues, including the stomodeum and its derivatives such as the pituitary, where a large set of Pitx1 target genes has been identified. Pitx3 is expressed in the midbrain dopaminergic system and in the eyes (34Tremblay K.D. Hoodless P.A. Bikoff E.K. Robertson E.J.

The different isoforms arise from alternative splicing and use of different promoters. All isoforms can combine as homodimers, and heterodimers are formed with Pitx2b (43Cox C.J. Espinoza H.M.

We searched for proteins interacting with GCMa and identified Pitx proteins. At least one Pitx protein is localized in the same tissues where GCMa is expressed. Furthermore, the interaction of GCMa and Pitx modulates GCMa-dependent promoter activation in reporter gene assays. We mapped the GCMa DNA-binding domain and the homeodomain of Pitx proteins as the regions that physically associate with each other. Our findings that GCMa interacts and cooperates with a member of the Pitx transcription factor family might open a new avenue for the identification of GCMa target genes and will yield insight into the mechanistic aspects of GCMa function. Plasmid Constructs and Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—Bait plasmids were generated by subcloning full-length GCMa and parts thereof into pGBKT7 (Clontech) using restriction sites EcoRI and SalI. DNA fragments were amplified from the GCMa cDNA (Fig. 1) by use of the following 5′-primer: 5′-atg aat tca tgg aac tgg acg act ttg a-3′ and 3′-primers: 5′-gca ggt cga cgt tat ctt aaa gaa cag aag tt-3′ (full-length) or 5′-gca ggt cga cgt tat gtg ctg taa gtg ccg ggc ag-3′ (GCMa220, Fig. 1). For expression and immunoprecipitation, GCMa constructs were myc-tagged and transferred to pCMV5 by PCR amplification using the 5′-primer: 5′-tat aga tct gcc acc atg gag gag cag aa-3′ annealing 5′ to the myc-epitope of pGBKT7 and the above mentioned 3′-primers with one of the different bait plasmids as template. Additionally a myc-tagged GCMa167, containing only the DNA-binding domain of GCMa was created by using the same 5′-primer and 5′-cag tcg act cac atg tgc act ttc ttc atg-3′ as 3′-primer. The insert of the prey plasmid containing of human Pitx1 (Acc. No. XM_047746.1, pos. 560–1273) was transferred to pCMV5 and at the same time fused at the 5′-end with a T7 tag by use of BamHI and XhoI. For cloning of full-length mouse Pitx2c, BamHI and NotI were used as restriction sites and RT-PCR was carried out using adult mouse kidney as RNA source, and primers 5′-cgg gat ccg atg aac tgc atg aaa ggc-3′ and 5′-gaa tgc ggc cgc tca cac cgg ccg gtc gac-3′ (see Acc. No. NM_011098.1). For identification of the interacting epitope of Pitx2c a number of deletion mutants have been generated (Fig. 1c). Primers 5′-gat cga att cca acg ccg gca gag gac tca-3′ and 5′-gat cgt cga ctt agc gtt ccc gct ttc tcc att-3′ were used to amplify the homeodomain via PCR. The homeodomain containing PCR fragment was fused to a 5′-located T7 tag by subcloning it into pCMV5 using restriction sites BamHI and SalI. N-terminal deletions of Pitx2c were produced by using different primer pairs and restriction sites BamHI and SalI (5′-primers: 1, gatc ggatcc aac cag cag gcc gag ctg; 2, gat cgg atc cct gtc ctc tca gag tat gtt t; 3, gat cgg atc ctg tcc tta cgc gcc gcc gac t and 3′-primer: gat cgtc gac tca cac cgg ccg gtc gac). The same primers were used to subclone parts of Pitx2 into pGEX-KG to create GST fusions. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed mainly according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). In brief, after yeast transformation, transformants were selected on agar synthetic complete medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, or both. Screening of a human HeLa cDNA Matchmaker library (Clontech) was performed with GCMa220 fused to the Gal4-DNA-binding domain as bait. Potential candidates were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (positive control) or leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Growth was evaluated after 5 days of incubation at 30 °C. To ensure that positive clones do interact with the bait and not with the Gal4-DNA-binding domain instead, positive clones were separately checked for interaction with the isolated Gal4-DNA-binding domain. Selected positive clones were further confirmed by colony-lift filter assays for β-galactosidase activity as recommended (Clontech). A reporter plasmid containing five modules of adjacent GCM and Pitx-binding sites was constructed. For that purpose, a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-cgg gat cct gcc atg cgg gtg gat gct aag cct ctg tcc agt aga tct tc-3′ was cloned five times in tandem in front of the β-globin minimal promoter into the BglII site of pGL2-Basic (Promega). RNA Preparation, Reverse Transcription, and PCR—Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (18Hashemolhosseini S. Hadjihannas M. Stolt C.C. Haas C.S. Amann K. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 118: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After reverse transcription, cDNA was used in RT-PCR experiments either with specific primers (see “Plasmid Constructs” and below) or with mismatch primers 5′-atc gcg gtg tgg acc aac ct-3′ at the 5′ and 5′-cag gct ggc aag gct cga gtt-3′ at the 3′-end, that enable amplification of the homeodomains of all three Pitx members (only one nucleotide of each of the mismatch primers, shown in bold, does not correspond to the sequence of one of the three Pitxs; Pitx1, NM_011097.1, position 753–941; Pitx2, NM_011098.1, position 880–1068; and Pitx3, NM_008852.1 position 134–1042). Other sets of primers were used for analytical PCR amplification of each of the mouse Pitx members. For Pitx1, primers 5′-gga gaa ctc cgc cag cga at-3′ and 5′-gat tga gag gag agc ggg ct-3′ were used. Pitx2 was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-ccg cct cct cac cct tct gt-3′ and 5′-ttc ctt gct ggc cct tat ct-3′primer. Pitx3 was amplified by primers 5′-agt gac tcg gag aag gcc tc-3′ and 5′-agc cag agg ccc cac gtt ga-3′. These primers have been designed using sequence information of accession numbers NM_011097.1 (Pitx1), NM_011098.1 (Pitx2), and NM_008852.1 (Pitx3). Amplification products were separated on 2% (w/v) agarose gels after 20 cycles (for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) or 40 cycles (in mismatch PCRs and for mouse Pitx). In PCR experiments with mismatch primers, products were subcloned into pGEM-Teasy (Promega) and sequenced to determine their identity. First strand cDNA from dissected rat kidney cortex and outer and inner medulla were kindly provided by Drs. K. Höcherl and A. Kurtz (University of Regensburg). Analytical PCR studies with these first strand cDNAs were performed using rat-specific primers for GCMa (5′-ctc cag ctc ctt acg gat ga-3′ and 5′-agg agg ctg gaa ctg gtc tt-3′), Pitx2 (5′-gac tgg agg tgc ata caa tc-3′ and 5′-ata ctg gca agc act cag gt-3′), and β-actin (5′-tct aca atg agc tgc gtg tg-3′ and 5′-cca tct ctt gct cga agt ct-3′). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green kit and the Light-Cycler Thermal Cycle system (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissue Culture, Transfection, Extract Preparation, Western Blot, Luciferase Assays, Gel Retardation Assays, Immunoprecipitation, and GST Pull-downs—COS7, HEK293, and JEG-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. HEK293 and JEG-3 cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes with 1 μg of luciferase reporter and 0.1 μg of CMV-driven GCMa or 0.5 μg of Pitx expression vector for luciferase assays using DNA calcium phosphate precipitates (19Hashemolhosseini S.

COS7 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates for preparation of extracts using the DEAE-dextran technique followed by chloroquine treatment. The total amount of plasmid was kept constant using empty CMV vector. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase assays or extract preparation as described (19Hashemolhosseini S.

A monoclonal antibody directed against the T7-epitope (Novagen) or against the myc-epitope (Cell Signaling) and a polyclonal serum against the carboxyl-terminal half of GCMa (3Tuerk E.E. Schreiber J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4774-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) served as primary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution for monoclonal antibodies, 1:3,000 dilution for polyclonal ones), horseradish-peroxidase-coupled-protein A or anti-mouse-Ig-coupled-horseradish-peroxidase as secondary detection reagents in Western blots using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probe were incubated with COS7 cell extract for 20 min on ice in a 20-μl reaction mixture as described using poly[d(IC)] as unspecific competitor (5Cohen S.X. Moulin M. Hashemolhosseini S. Kilian K. Wegner M. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For supershift studies 0.5 μl of mouse anti-myc antibody (9E10, Cell Signaling) recognizing myc-tagged GCMa or mouse anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) binding to T7-tagged Pitx2 was added to the reaction mixture. Samples were loaded onto native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 120 V for 1.5 h. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. For immunoprecipitations, transiently transfected COS7 cells grown on 100-mm plates were lysed in the presence of 2 μg/μl leupeptin and aprotinin each in ice-cold 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Immediately after lysis, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 400 mm. After incubation for 15 min under constant rotation, cell debris was removed from the extract by centrifugation. One-fifth of the extract was used for immunoprecipitation after adding 1 μl of a monoclonal antibody against the T7- (Novagen) or myc-epitope (Cell Signaling) in 500 μl of HNTG buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) under constant rotation at 4 °C overnight. Next, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and incubation continued for another 1 h. After washing the beads five times with HNTG buffer, the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Alternatively, adult mouse kidneys were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Homogenization was carried out at 4 °C using a Dounce homogenizer with a typical tissue to buffer ratio of 8 ml of buffer per gram of tissue. After 20 strokes of homogenization, homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected. To bind antibodies to protein A-Sepharose, 40 μl of protein A beads were first incubated overnight with an equal mixture of goat-anti-Pitx2-C16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat-anti-Pitx2-N17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C in PBS. After removal of unbound supernatant, the antibody-loaded protein A-Sepharose was washed three times with PBS. The following steps were the same as for immunoprecipitation of cell extracts (see above). For detection of endogenous GCMa protein in Western blots a rabbit anti-GCMa antibody (3Tuerk E.E. Schreiber J. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4774-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used. For GST pull-downs, bacteria were grown in 200-ml cultures until A600 reached 0.4 and induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h to express the GST fusion proteins. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, incubated in sonification buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 25 units/ml benzonase, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μl/ml Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 15 units/μl lysozyme) at 4 °C for 30 min, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged. The supernatants containing the GST fusion proteins were supplemented by 30 μl of equilibrated glutathione beads and incubated under constant rotation at 4 °C. After washing three times with washing buffer (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 1.37 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) an aliquot of the beads, now carrying the GST fusion protein, was incubated together with 25 μl of extract from COS7 cells or mouse kidney tissue expressing the desired protein after transient transfection. After washing three times with washing buffer, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Tissue Sections and Immunohistochemistry—Mouse mating and genotyping were performed as described previously (14Schreiber J. Riethmacher-Sonnenberg E. Riethmacher D. Tuerk E.E. Enderich J. Bösl M. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemical analysis, kidneys were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and embedded in Tissue-Tec (Leica Instruments). Kidneys from adult mice were cryotome-sectioned to 12-μm slices. Cryotome sections were incubated with rabbit or goat anti-lacZ antibodies and polyclonal goat-anti Pitx2-C16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy2 and Cy3 immunofluorescent dyes (Dianova) were used for detection. Pitx Homeodomain Proteins Interact with GCMa—To isolate cofactors interacting with GCMa, we set up a yeast two-hybrid screen. Because fusions of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to carboxyl-terminal GCMa regions containing the protein's transactivation domains (44Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) induced Gal4-dependent reporters in transformed yeast, even in the absence of a Gal4-activation domain, we fused different amino-terminal portions of GCMa to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The amino-terminal part of GCMa up to the first transactivation domain exhibited tolerable autonomous transactivation and could be used as bait for the Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system (GCMa220, Fig. 1, a and d). Expression of the bait (GCMa220) was verified by Western blot. Furthermore, growth kinetics of transformed yeast were not disturbed indicating the absence of toxicity for the bait (data not shown). After screening roughly 750,000 independent yeast colonies from a Matchmaker HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) in the AH109 yeast strain, 20 colonies grew on selective media lacking adenine and histidine. Of these, five clones could be reconfirmed as true po"

Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; pN, piconewton. 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; pN, piconewton. RT) is the enzyme responsible for copying the RNA genome of the AIDS virus into a double-stranded DNA provirus, which is incorporated into the host genome. It has three distinct functions: 1) polymerizing a DNA strand complementary to the genomic RNA, thus forming an RNA-DNA hybrid (reverse transcriptase activity); 2) degrading the original RNA, leaving behind a single-stranded DNA copy (RNase H activity); 3) generating a second DNA strand complementary to the first strand, creating the double-stranded DNA provirus (DNA polymerase activity) (1Frankel A. Young J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Because creating the provirus is a necessary central step in HIV infection, HIV RT is the target of many anti-AIDS therapeutic drugs such as azidothymidine, lamivudine, efavirenz, and nevirapine (2Merluzzi V.J. Hargrave K.D. Labadia M. Grozinger K. Skoog M. Wu J.C. Shih C-K. Eckner K. Hattox S. Adams J. Rosehthal A.S. Faanes R. Eckner R.J. Koup R.A. Sullivan J.L.

More generally, the structure and catalytic mechanisms of HIV are closely related to those of other well studied reverse transcriptases (e.g. MMLuV) (5Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and small DNA polymerases (e.g. T7 DNA polymerase, Escherichia coli Pol I) (6Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 7Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 8Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Hence, understanding how HIV RT works, how its functional capabilities arise from structure and sequence, is important both for medicine and for basic science. During one polymerization cycle, any polymerase must align the primer-template DNA with the catalytic site, orient the downstream template base, bind and align the incoming nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) monomer, recognize the complementary NTP and reject others, catalyze the formation of the new phosphodiester bond, release the pyrophosphate product, and finally move along the DNA to the next location. Except for the bond-forming reactions, all of these steps can be viewed as mechanical processes made possible by motions and interactions among protein domains acting together like parts in a protein machine. A number of recent crystal structures (9Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S. Clark A. JacoboMolina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S. Arnold E. J. Mol.

Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) have elucidated the nature of the key parts and motions (see Fig. 1a), and ensemble kinetics measurements have helped define the main biochemical states (12Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S. Wohrl B. Goody R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Furge L. Guengerich F.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5054-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1b), but to date no mechanical studies of HIV RT have been reported. In part this is because of the difficulty of measuring motor-like forces and motions of proteins, which tend to average out in ensembles and so must be measured on individual molecules. HIV RT presents a particular challenge because its processivity is low (for DNA polymerase activity, ∼20 base pairs) (14Pop M. Biebricher C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5054-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Kati W. Johnson K. Jerva L. Anderson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its step size is small (∼0.34 nm/base incorporated), so the net movement along the DNA during a single polymerization run is small. To overcome this problem, we have developed a single molecule motor force and motion experiment using an atomic force microscope cantilever as the force sensor. The atomic force microscope has the spatial resolution to detect short runs of polymerization by HIV RT and sufficient force resolution to detect its motor forces. By measuring polymerization velocity under increasing load until the motor stalls, the experiments have been used to construct an approximate force-velocity curve. The curve shows a stall force of about 15 pN for HIV RT, and the shape of the curve is consistent with the load force acting strongly on the rate-limiting step of the polymerase turnover cycle. These results, together with ensemble kinetics and structural information, suggest that the closing of the fingers domain is a major force-generating step for the HIV RT molecular motor. Biotinylated primer-template DNA (Fig. 2b) was formed by annealing the primer to a 5′-biotinylated template oligonucleotide (both purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) from 70 to 21 °C. HIV RT was purchased from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ) or Amersham Biosciences. Biotin-bovine serum albumin was purchased from Sigma. Neutravidin, which is thought to have less nonspecific binding than streptavidin, was purchased from Pierce. All motor force experiments were carried out with a modified NanoScope IIIa atomic force microscope controlled externally by a computer equipped with DAQ boards and running software written in LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Triangular cantilevers with force constant 10 pN/nm (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) were used. To reduce thermal drift without loss of detector sensitivity, the gold coating was stripped from the cantilever arms and base but retained near the apex of the triangle by dipping the tip end in rubber cement, dissolving the gold with HCl/HNO3, and removing the excess rubber cement with chloroform. Tips were then cleaned by extensive ozonolysis and UV irradiation. HIV RT was adsorbed to tips by placing a 5-μl 0.5 μm droplet on the tip for 3 min and then rinsing with 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8)). DNA was attached to the cover glass in a 3-step process: a 10-μl droplet of 1.8 mg/ml biotinylated bovine serum albumin placed on the glass for 5 min, followed by a rinse with buffer A; a 10-μl droplet of 1 mg/ml neutravidin for 5 min, followed by a second rinse; and finally a 10-μl droplet of 1 μm biotinylated primer-template DNA for 5 min and a final rinse. Control experiments were carried out by omitting either the primertemplate DNA or the nucleotides but were otherwise identical to full experiments. Control experiments were typically very clean with little thermal drift and no binding between tip and surface. The root mean square thermal noise observed was usually less than 0.2 nm (2 pN) in a 10-Hz bandwidth. After repeated physical contacts between tip and surface (30–40 cycles, see below), sticking and stretching of polymeric material between tip and surface was sometimes observed. We attributed this to denatured protein on the tip and usually stopped the experiment after ∼20 contacts or whenever sticking occurred. The force-velocity curve was constructed by spline-fitting experimental traces of cantilever deflection, x, versus time and then calculating the number of bases polymerized at each time using the freely jointed chain model without intrinsic stretch modulus (16Smith S.B. Cui Y. Bustamante C. Science. 1996; 271: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar), n(t) = (h - F(t)/κ)/(lL(F(t)l/kBT)), where h = F(0)/κ + n(0)lL(F(0)l/kBT), F(t)) is the force of cantilever deflection at time t, κ is the cantilever force constant (10 pN/nm), l is the length of one single-stranded monomer unit (0.7 nm in our calculations), kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. The function L(x) is the Langevin function, L(x) = 1/tanh(x) - 1/x, and F(0) and n(0) are the initial force and DNA template length (in bases), respectively. Motor Forces Versus Time—The basic motor force experiment is illustrated in Fig. 2a. HIV RT is adsorbed to the sharp tip of the cantilever (20–50 nm radius), which allows the polymerase to approach the surface to within a few nanometers without unwanted contacts. A 5′-biotinylated, 56-base DNA template with a 10-base primer annealed at its 3′-end is attached to a glass surface by a layer of neutravidin bound to a layer of biotinylated bovine serum albumin. The substrate is mounted on a piezoelectric positioner and can be raised or lowered to bring the DNA closer or farther from the tip. Finally, a saturating concentration (100 μm) in each of the four nucleotides in the surrounding buffer ensures that once a “hookup” takes place, the polymerase molecule will fill in the template, shortening the DNA tether and deflecting the cantilever. The results of several experiments are shown in Fig. 3, a–c. At the beginning of each experiment the substrate is raised (top trace) until the tip touches lightly (∼20 pN), establishing the tip-surface distance. The substrate then retracts to break any hookups that may have occurred during the touch and then reapproaches, stopping at a preset tip-sample distance, (8–15 nm). Calculations with freely jointed chain or worm-like chain models for the DNA suggest that at this range of distances the free ends of the DNA will bind to the tip-adsorbed polymerase molecules at a reasonable rate (between ∼0.1 and 5 s-1). The tip hovers above the substrate for a time (∼10 s), “fishing” for hookups and recording the resulting cantilever deflections. Finally the surface retracts again at the end of the experimental cycle. At the end of each cycle the tip is moved laterally (by about 20 nm) so that each cycle interrogates a new spot on the substrate surface. Motor events occurred only about once every several hundred cycles. In Fig. 3a, polymerization begins rapidly (∼10.5 s) from the initial approach, but as load force builds up (∼13 pN) the polymerase slows to a near stall. On this occasion the sample retracts from the tip while the hookup is still intact, so the DNA is mechanically stretched. At ∼40 pN the hookup breaks, either because the DNA dissociates from the HIV RT or some other link between tip and substrate breaks. Fig. 3b shows two traces, one in which no hookup occurred (middle curve, essentially identical to one of the traces in a control experiment) and one taken immediately afterward (bottom curve) that is similar to the trace in Fig. 3a except that dissociation occurs without mechanical stretching. This trace reveals a “hookup transient”, a small, sudden force preceding the main run, which is fairly frequently seen (the curve in Fig. 3a may also have one). We have interpreted these transients as binding between DNA and HIV RT under conditions where the DNA is slightly stretched. This run also demonstrated that the polymerase continues to “stutter” slowly forward even after a near stall (∼10 pN). HIV RT has no (proofreading) 3′-5′-exonuclease activity and, in the absence of pyrophosphate, is unable to reverse polymerization by pyrophosphorolysis. Polymerization is thus effectively irreversible, meaning that the motor can move slowly forward under high load force by taking advantage of favorable thermal fluctuations (17Keller D. Bustamante C. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 541-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fig. 3c illustrates the variety expected of stochastic process; one run is slow and steady, the immediately following run is fast and erratic. Interestingly, the stuttering phase of the lower curve seems to show a series of three roughly flat regions separated by ∼3.5 pN, which corresponds to the expected net cantilever deflection for incorporation of one base under the prevailing template tension. Though the noise is too large to make a clear identification, these features (and those observed in other runs) are consistent with single base steps of DNA replication. Force-Velocity Curve—Each motor force event in Fig. 3 reveals the velocity of the polymerase motor over a full range of applied load forces, from near zero to stall. Fifteen such events have been used to construct a rough force-velocity curve (Fig. 4). The polymerase velocity at zero load was measured earlier using single molecule fluorescence methods. 2T. P. Ortiz, J. A. Marshall, L. A. Meyer, R. W. Davis, J. C. Macosko, D. J. Keller, and J. A. Brozik, unpublished data. The shape of the force-velocity curve provides two important pieces of information. First, the velocity drops immediately and rapidly, even at low load. External forces can only affect mechanical processes, i.e. transitions that involve a significant physical motion along the direction in which the force is applied. If the force were acting only on a fast kinetic step in the turnover cycle, the velocity would be only slightly affected by load and the force-velocity curve would be nearly flat at low load. Only at high force, when the affected step has been slowed until it has become rate-limiting, would the velocity decrease rapidly. Thus, the fact that the velocity falls rapidly even at the smallest forces implies that the load is acting on the “natural” (zero load) rate-limiting step and that this step is mechanical in nature. Previous work has identified the closing of the fingers domain to form a tight catalytic complex with incoming nucleotide as the zero-load rate-limiting step (18Johnson K.A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). This is indeed a mechanical step, consistent with our results. Second, at forces near stall the velocity must be approximately proportional to the rate-limiting rate constant (at that force), and the shape of the curve therefore gives the dependence of this rate constant on load force. Thus, we take the velocity in this region to have an Arrhenius form, v = v0e -(ΔH0 - FΔx)/kBT, where Δx is the effective size of the motion associated with the transition. A plot of log velocity versus force should then be linear with slope proportional to Δx. As shown in Fig. 4, our data are consistent with a motion of between 1 and 3 nm, with 1.6 nm the most likely value. This is too large to be fingers movement alone (∼1 nm or less for HIV RT, as measured from crystal structures in open and closed states (9Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S. Clark A. JacoboMolina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar)) and so must involve a combination of steps, including (possibly) template base stacking (up to ∼0.7 nm) and translocation (up to 0.34 nm). Nonetheless, both the low force and high force regions of the force curve are consistent with the idea that load force acts on the fingers-closing step and that fingers-closing is probably the main force-generating process for the HIV RT molecular motor. The ability to generate force is crucial to the function of all DNA and RNA polymerases; movement along the DNA, displacement of DNA-bound protein and non-template DNA strands, clearing loops and stems in the template, and negotiating nucleosomes all require force. The combination of motor force measurements and single molecule fluorescence points toward the fingers-closing step as a major force-generating transition within the overall polymerization cycle. A similar conclusion was reached from previous measurements on the motor forces of T7 DNA polymerase (19Wuite G.J.L. Smith S.B. Young M. Keller D. Bustamante C. Nature. 2000; 404: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), which, like HIV RT, is the replicase for its respective organism and seems to function by the same basic mechanism. The fingers domain thus appears to play several key roles in the functioning of the polymerase machine, including clamping the template base, incoming nucleotide, and catalytic site in the correct relative orientations; helping to recognize the complementary nucleotide and reject mismatches; coordinating the various steps (nucleotide binding, catalysis, translocation) of the turnover cycle; and, in light of the data presented here, generating motor forces. The fingers domain and its motions thus emerge as perhaps the defining feature of all polymerases. We thank Dr. Basame Solomon, Dr. Jason A. Marshall, Jeremy Shelton, and Theodore P. Ortiz for help."

At neutral pH the fragment-(1–56) is hexacoordinated and has two histidines axially ligated to the heme-Fe(III) (Santucci, R., Fiorucci, L., Sinibaldi, F., Polizio, F., Desideri, A., and Ascoli, F.

The kinetics of the formation of the complex between the two fragments are characterized at pH 7.0 by a slow rate constant that is independent of the concentration of the reactants; conversely, at a low pH the kinetics are much faster and depend on the concentration of the fragments. This behavior suggests that the rate-limiting step observed in the recombination process of the fragments at neutral pH (that leads to the final coordination of Met-80) has to be ascribed to the detachment of the “misligated” histidine. Thus, the faster recombination rate at a low pH can be related to the fact that histidine is protonated and not able to coordinate to the metal. Furthermore, the independence of the rate constant on the concentration of the reactants observed at pH 7.0 can be accounted for by the occurrence of a conformational transition, which takes place immediately after the two fragments collapse together, likely simulating what induces the detachment of the misligated histidine during cytochrome folding.

Protein folding is a central topic in the modern structural biology and has attracted a great deal of interest in the last decade. Several studies have elucidated that many small proteins fold rapidly to the unique native state following a simple two-state process (1Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct.

A. 1993; 90: 11860-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the introduction of fast kinetic methods for the detection of intermediate states has opened new scenarios in the description of the protein folding process (for a review, see Refs. 3Eaton W.A.

In this context, cytochrome c (cyt c) 1The abbreviations used are: cyt c, oxidized horse heart cytochrome c; F1, fragment corresponding to the residues 1–56 of cytochrome c; F2, fragment corresponding to residues 57–104 of cytochrome c.1The abbreviations used are: cyt c, oxidized horse heart cytochrome c; F1, fragment corresponding to the residues 1–56 of cytochrome c; F2, fragment corresponding to residues 57–104 of cytochrome c. represents an ideal system to investigate, because it is one of the most studied proteins (5Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c. Evolutionary, Structural and Physiological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1990Google Scholar) and its high-resolution x-ray structure is available (6Bushnell G.W. Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar).The folding of cyt c is characterized by a variety of long lived intermediates, some of which are ascribed to proline isomerization (7Pierce M.M. Nall B.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 955-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas others are referable to non-native heme ligation (8Elöve G.A. Bhuyan A.K. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6925-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 9Pierce M.M. Nall B.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An important aspect in the kinetic study of cyt c folding is the formation at a neutral pH of a misligated compact intermediate having a histidine side chain (His-26 or His-33) axially ligated to the sixth coordinate position of the heme-Fe(III) in place of Met-80 (the residue coordinated to the metal in the native protein) (10Colòn W. Wakem L.P. Sherman F. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12535-12541Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Yeh S-R. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17853-17859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed to be an on-pathway intermediate (12Bai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the non-native His-Fe(III) ligation indeed represents a kinetic barrier for the folding of the polypeptide into the native conformation, therefore sensibly reducing the protein folding rate (13Yeh S-R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by the fact that at an acidic pH, the folding of cyt c proceeds faster, being that histidines are largely protonated (14Yeh S-R. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).The peptide fragments of cyt c can be achieved by a limited proteolysis of the protein (15Fontana A. Zambonin M. De Filippis V. Bosco M. Polverino de Laureto P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, the properties of a 56-residue heme-containing fragment (here indicated as fragment 1 (F1), with the amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 1–56 of native horse cyt c) have been determined (16Santucci R. Fiorucci L. Sinibaldi F. Polizio F. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and F1 turns out to be hexacoordinated and largely disordered. Like the native protein, F1 retains His-18 axially bound to the metal, but the other axial ligand of the heme-iron is proposed to be a histidine residue (His-26 or His-33) in place of Met-80 (a residue not present in the fragment sequence, see Fig. 1).Fig. 1Structural representation of horse heart cytochrome c. The two fragments have been drawn in different colors, namely the fragment 1–56 (F1) is drawn as a dark rubber line, whereas the fragment 57–104 (F2) is drawn as a white rubber line.

Fiorucci L. Mei G. Ferri T. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Santucci R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4537-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At a neutral pH the fragment complex shows a native-like α-helix structure and His-18-Fe(III)-Met-80 axial coordination to the heme. This suggests that the fragment recombination to form the complex implies an axial ligand displacement from a His-Fe(III)-His to a His-Fe(III)-Met coordination.The goal of the present kinetic investigation is a deeper understanding of the events associated with the axial ligand exchange at the sixth coordination position of the heme-Fe(III) during complex formation, a process that leads to the native His-18-Fe(III)-Met-80 coordination. Such an approach is expected to provide a relevant contribution to better clarify the mechanism(s) governing the last steps of the cyt c folding pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOxidized horse heart cyt c (type VI) and thermolysin were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. All other reagents were of analytical grade.The digestion of cyt c and purification of F1-(1–56) and F2-(57–104) were performed as previously described (15Fontana A. Zambonin M. De Filippis V. Bosco M. Polverino de Laureto P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Santucci R. Fiorucci L. Sinibaldi F. Polizio F. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The fragments were used immediately after preparation and purification. Absorption spectra have been obtained using a Varian V-530 spectrophotometer, and circular dichroism spectra have been obtained using a Jasco J-700 spectrometer equipped with PC as data processor.Kinetic studies following optical absorption changes have been carried out using a SX.18MV stopped flow (Applied Photophysics, Salisbury, UK) with a 1-ms dead time. Experiments have been undertaken mixing F1, dissolved in the desired environment (pH 7.0 or 3.8), with F2 previously dissolved at pH 7.0 and very low ionic strength. The final pH was measured directly on the final mixture, and it was considered the actual pH at which the reaction occurred. The progress curves were recorded at several different wavelengths (e.g. 280, 408, or 695 nm) to acquire more complete spectroscopic information on the processes taking place.CD kinetic measurements have been carried out employing a rapid-mixing apparatus SFM-20 (Biologic Science Instruments) with 8-ms dead time and interfaced with the Jasco J-700 spectrometer. The setting of the experiment was closely similar to that employed for optical absorption kinetics (see above), but the investigation has been limited to pH 7.0. Experiments were undertaken at 20 °C.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe far-UV CD spectrum of the complex has been reported previously (16Santucci R. Fiorucci L. Sinibaldi F. Polizio F. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Sinibaldi F. Fiorucci L. Mei G. Ferri T. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Santucci R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4537-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, the far-UV circular dichroism spectra of the two isolated fragments are compared with that of the complex recorded under the same conditions. The far-UV CD clearly indicates that the two isolated fragments possess a substantially disordered structure, characterized by negligible α-helical content (see Fig. 2). The CD spectrum is unaffected by pH down to a value of 3 (data not shown). On the other hand, the complex formation brings about a CD signal revealing the appearance of an α-helical conformation comparable with that of native cyt c (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 16Santucci R. Fiorucci L. Sinibaldi F. Polizio F. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This process is characterized by a strong association equilibrium constant, because essentially 100% of the complex formation is observed already at ≅0.1 μm concentration (i.e. a value ∼20-fold lower than what was employed throughout this study).Fig. 2Far-UV circular dichroism spectra at pH 7.0 of the cyt c complex (continuous line) of the 1–56 F1 complex (dashed line) and of the 57–104 F2 complex (dashed-dotted line) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The pH dependence of the Soret absorption spectra of F1 and of the fragment complex are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. Fig. 3C displays the pH dependence of the circular dichroism of the complex over the same wavelength range. At pH 7.0 the absorption spectrum of F1 is virtually identical to that of the complex (see Fig. 3, A and B), with both showing a maximum at 406 nm. Unlike absorption, the dichroic spectrum of F1 at pH 7.0 differs significantly from that of the fragment complex; in particular, it misses the negative 416-nm Cotton effect (see Ref. 16Santucci R. Fiorucci L. Sinibaldi F. Polizio F. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This is not surprising, because in the native cyt c the 416-nm signal is ascribed to the Met-80-Fe(III) axial coordination (18Pielak G.J. Oikawa K. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Kay C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2724-2727Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the Soret CD spectrum of the fragment complex at pH 7.0 (see Fig. 3C) this signal is observed, being consistent with the Met-80-Fe(III) coordination. Some minor heterogeneity is observed in solution, as revealed by the blue shifts of the Cotton effects (414 versus 416 nm and 401 versus 406 nm) and by the lower intensity of the 416-nm Cotton effect of the fragment complex with respect to the native cyt c (5Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c. Evolutionary, Structural and Physiological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1990Google Scholar).Fig. 3pH dependence of absorption spectra of F1 fragment (A), the F1 + F2 complex (B) and of the circular dichroism spectra of the complex (C). pH values reported in the three panels correspond to those at which the spectra have been collected, following the direction of spectra closer to the digits. For further details, see text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As the pH is lowered, the absorption band is blue-shifted from 406 to 396 nm (for F1 alone) and to 395 nm (for the complex) (see Fig. 3, A and B), while the CD spectrum of the complex displays the progressive disappearance of the negative 416-nm Cotton effect, associated with the progressive enhancement of the 402-nm Cotton effect (which is also blue-shifted to 398 nm, see Fig. 3C). The pH dependence of absorption spectra, followed at 406 nm, clearly indicates the occurrence of a transition from the hexa- to the pentacoordination of the heme, which is characterized by a pKa = 4.21 (±0.16) for F1 and by pKa = 3.18 (±0.18) for the complex (see Fig. 4A). Thus, in F1 pentacoordination takes place at a higher pH with respect to the complex, indicating that detachment of the axially “misligated” histidine from the metal in the fragment F1 requires less energy than detachment of Met-80 in the fragment complex. This interpretation indeed seems supported by the features observed in the pH-dependent behavior of the CD spectra, where the pH-induced transition in the fragment complex (followed through the progressive disappearance of the 416-nm Cotton effect, see Fig. 3C) shows a similar pKa value (3.23 ± 0.17, see Fig. 4B).Fig. 4pH dependence of the absorption at 406 nm for the F1 fragment (x) and for the complex (o) (A), and pH dependence of the circular dichroism at 414 nm (o) and at 398 nm (x) (B) are shown. In both panels, continuous lines are the non-linear least-squares fitting of data, employing the equation Pobs = P0 + ΔP·Ka·[H+]/(1 + Ka·[H+]), where Pobs is the observed value of the parameter (either OD or CD) at a given pH value, P0 is the value of the parameter extrapolated to infinitely low [H+], ΔP is the total pH-dependent variation of the parameter (which can have either a positive or a negative value), Ka is the proton affinity constant (defined as Ka = 10pKa). Continuous lines have been obtained with following parameters. A, for F1, P0 = 0.198 ± 0.021, ΔP = –0.073 ± 0.008, pKa = 4.21 ± 0.16; for the complex, P0 = 0.179 ± 0.019, ΔP =–0.094 ± 0.011, pKa = 3.18 ± 0.18. B, for the complex at 414 nm, P0 =–0.837 ± 0.094, ΔP = 2.27 ± 0.24, pKa = 3.23 ± 0.17; for the complex at 398 nm, P0 = 0.791 ± 0.083, ΔP = 1.28 ± 0.15, pKa = 3.39 ± 0.18.

Santucci R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4537-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), mixing F1 with F2 at a neutral pH brings about the formation of a complex characterized by a compact close-to-native tertiary assembly, in which a His is replaced by Met-80 from the axial coordination to the heme-Fe (III). On the other hand, the different pKa values for the pH-dependent transition of F1 and of the complex (see Fig. 4) indeed suggest that at pH 3.8 the formation of the complex can be achieved in the absence of a misligated His (19Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The kinetics of complex formation as a function of F1 concentration was followed at the two pH values and at three distinct wavelengths, namely at 695 nm (to directly follow the formation of the Fe(III)-Met-80 bond, see Ref. 20Stellwagen E. Cass R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1974; 60: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), at 408 nm (to follow the evolution of the axial coordination at the heme), and at 280 nm (exploiting the change of Trp-59 absorption to follow directly the complex formation, see Ref. 17Sinibaldi F. Fiorucci L. Mei G. Ferri T. Desideri A. Ascoli F. Santucci R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4537-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Fig. 5A shows the kinetics of the Fe(III)-Met-80 bond formation at pH 7.0, following the absorption change at 695 nm; a closely similar progress curve is obtained at 408 nm, clearly indicating that we are observing the same event at the two wavelengths. However, the much higher extinction efficient at 408 nm renders this last wavelength more preferable for working at a low protein concentration.Fig. 5Kinetic progress curves of complex formation. A, progress curves at 408 nm (curve a) and at 695 nm (curve b) following the mixing of 12.5 μm F1 with 2.5 μm F2. The absolute optical density of the two progress curves (but not the optical density change) has been scaled to make them fit into a limited range of optical density. Least-squares fitting of progress curves has been carried out according to the following analytical equation Sobs = S∞ + ΔS·e(–k·t), where Sobs is the observed signal (either optical density or circular dichroism), S∞ is the final signal (either optical density or circular dichroism), ΔS is the variation of signal (either optical density or circular dichroism), which can have either a positive or negative value (according to whether the observed signal decreases or increases as a function of time), k is the (pseudo)first-order rate constant and t is time. Continuous curves correspond to least-squares fitting of progress curves according to this equation, employing the following parameters: curve a, S∞ = 0.049 ± 0.005, ΔS = 0.009 ± 0.001, k = 0.143 ± 0.016; curve b, S∞ = 0.040 ± 0.005, ΔS = –0.005 ± 0.001, k = 0.148 ± 0.017. B, progress curves at 408 nm following the mixing of 2.5 μm F2 with 12.5 μm F1 (curve a) or with 3.1 μm F1 (curve b). The optical density of the two progress curves has been scaled (keeping intact the change in optical density), to make them fit into a limited range of optical density and to immediately compare them. C, kinetic progress curves of the complex formation at pH 7.0 following the mixing of 12.5 μm F1 with 2.5 μm F2 at 280 nm (o) and at 408 nm (x). The two progress curves have been reported on a logarithmic time scale, and their optical density has been scaled to have overlapping values of optical density for experimental points at the same time interval. For further details, see text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A very peculiar aspect of the kinetics observed at pH 7.0, associated with the events occurring at the heme pocket (i.e. at 408 and 695 nm), is that both the rate constant of the complex formation and the corresponding amplitude of the absorption change turned out to be independent from the concentration of F1 with an apparent rate constant of 0.14 (±0.03) s–1 (see Fig. 5B). Conversely, the rate observed at 280 nm is linearly independent on the concentration of F1, as expected for a bimolecular process (Fig. 6), giving a second-order association rate constant of 7.2 (±0.8) × 106m–1 s–1 at pH 7.0 and a dissociation rate constant of 22.0 (±2.5) s–1. Therefore, the analysis of data at different wavelengths provides two kinds of information, namely the complex formation rate constant, which is fast (from observations at 280 nm, see Fig. 5C) and the rate of replacement of the misligated His by Met-80, which occurs only at a later stage (as monitored at 408 and 695 nm, see Fig. 5, A and C).Fig. 6Dependence of the observed rate constant for the mixing of F1 with F2 (kobs, s–1) on the concentration of F1. The observed rate constants have been collected at pH 7.0 at 280 nm (o), at pH 3.8 at 408 nm (x) and at 280 nm (*). The continuous lines correspond to the non-linear least-squares fitting of data according to the equation kobs = kon·[F1] + koff, where kobs is the observed rate constant at a given concentration of F1, kon rate is the second-order association constant for the complex formation and koff is the dissociation rate constant of the complex. Continuous lines have been obtained with following parameters: pH 7.0 at 280 nm, kon = 7.2 (± 0.8) × 106m–1–1 s–1, koff = 22.0 (±2.5) s–1; for pH 3.8 at 408 nm, kon = 3.5 (±0.4) × 106m–1 s–1, koff = 6.3 (±0.7) s–1; for pH 3.8 at 280 nm, kon = 5.6 (±0.6) × 106m–1 s–1, koff = 3.5 (±0.4) s–1. For further details, see text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the basis of the results obtained at pH 7.0, we are thus expecting at lower pH values a much faster rate at 408 nm (similar to that at 280 nm), because most of F1 does not undergo His misligation (see Figs. 3 and 4). Indeed, at pH 3.8 we observe a much faster progress curve (see Fig. 7), and the rate of the optical change at 408 nm now depends on the concentration of F1, like at 280 nm (see Fig. 6), displaying a second-order rate constant at pH 3.8 (5.6 (±0.6) × 106m–1 s–1), which is similar, although not identical, to that obtained for the fragment complex formation at pH 7.0 (followed at 280 nm, see Fig. 6). Therefore, this result shows that the complex formation occurs at a rate that is essentially pH-independent from the pH range between 3.8 and 7.0, suggesting that the recognition process between the two fragments in not modulated by residues that protonate within this pH range. On the other hand, the dissociation rate constant of the complex at pH 3.8 (3.5 s–1) is much slower than at pH 7.0, indicating a higher stability of the assembled form at lower pH possibly because of the protonation of some residue. This suggests that ionic interactions are important for the stability of the complex between the two fragments. It also strengthens the idea that pH lowering does not alter drastically the association equilibrium constant; the overall value of the constant is related not only to the complex formation of the two fragments collapsing together but also to the thermodynamics of different steps leading to the final native-like His-18-Fe(III)-Met-80 form.Fig. 7Progress curves at 408 nm, following the mixing at pH 3.8 of 2.5 μm F2 with 3.1 μm F1 (curve a), 6.2 μm F1 (curve b), and 25 μm F1 (curve c). The progress curves have been scaled to have a closely similar optical density at t ≅ 0. Because even at pH 3.8 there is still a fraction of misligated His (ranging between 10 and 15%), the actual progress curves also display a very slow fraction (not shown here), whose rate closely resembles that observed at pH 7.0 (see legend to Fig. 3) and the amplitude corresponds to the percentage fraction of misligated His. For further details, see text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At this point, we can give a first sketch of the various steps characterizing the complex formation at neutral pH. In the first step of Scheme 1, the collapse of the two fragments brings about the formation of an initial complex (called Complex 1), in which no change in the heme coordination occurs (corresponding to the process followed at 280 nm). In the following step, the dissociation of the misligated His takes place, giving rise to a pentacoordinated species (called Complex 2). Finally, Met-80 coordinates to the metal, and the final native-like Met-80-Fe(III) coordinated form (indicated as Complex 3) is stabilized. The different observations obtained at 280 nm with respect to those collected at 408 and 695 nm may indeed be related to the fact that at 280 nm we are following the formation of Complex 1, whereas at 408 and 695 nm we are detecting the formation of Complex 3 (see Fig. 5C). From the application of Scheme 1 it turns out also that the rate of formation of Complex 2 (associated to the dissociation of the misligated His) is the rate-limiting step for the evolution toward the native-like Complex 3 (see also Fig. 5C).Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, to prove the applicability of this scheme we must be able to simulate quantitatively its behavior, taking into account the features displayed by the system. Therefore, computer simulations of the time evolution of different populations of complexes according to Scheme 1 (as well as of the following Scheme 2) have been carried out employing a Runge-Kutta second-order algorithm in which the time evolution of the individual populations was reckoned for each individual time step x, taking into account the rates of their formation and of their disappearance. Thus, as an example, for Complex 2 from Scheme 1, the calculation for each step was as follows,[[Complex 2]t=[Complex 2]t−x+(k+2⋅[Complex 1]t−x+k−3⋅[Complex 3]t−x−[Complex 2]t−x⋅(k−2+k+3))⋅x](Eq. 1) Scheme 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In this respect, one important observation (reported in Fig. 5B) indicates that at pH 7.0 the rate of the absorption change at 408 nm (following the formation of Complex 3) remains constant, independently from the concentration of F1. It suggests that according to Scheme 1 the amount of Complex 1 transforming into Complex 2 is not dependent on the concentration of F1, at least within the F1 concentration range investigated. A computer simulation of the behavior of the system according to Scheme 1 has been carried out, employing the bimolecular rate constant for the formation of Complex 1 as calculated on the basis of data reported in Fig. 6. An arbitrary set of rate constants has been employed for the additional steps, whose values refer to the gross kinetic relationships among different steps, accounting for faster and slower processes (see Table I). However, the simulation obtained according to Scheme 1 indicates that even keeping constant the concentration of F2 (as it occurs in our experiments), the rate of formation of Complex 3 (observed at 408 nm) is dependent on the concentration of F1 over the investigated concentration range (see Fig. 8A). This discrepancy with respect to the observed behavior (see Fig. 5B) appears intrinsic to t"
