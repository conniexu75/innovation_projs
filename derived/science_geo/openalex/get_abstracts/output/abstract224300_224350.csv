A study of possible antibiotic production by the mould was suggested by the observation that host tissue incorporated in the pseudosclerotium is resistant to decay."
https://openalex.org/W2092995528,"IT has been shown in a series of recent papers13 that baker's yeast grown in the presence of acriflavine undergoes a profound modification. After a few generations of growth in the presence of the dye, the culture is found to be composed almost exclusively of cells which are deficient in some respiratory enzymes (cytoehrome oxidase, succinic dehydro-genase) and which are consequently unable to oxidize glucose. Cells presenting these characteristics have been isolated in pure cultures which have been maintained in normal rnedium for several years. Their respiratory deficiency has proved to be permanent."

https://openalex.org/W2051698584,"DURING the past thirty years, some twenty species of marsupials have been examined cytologically. In all of them, a typical XY sex-chromosome mechanism has been reported. We have recently re-investigated the potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), a common species of rat-kangaroo in Tasmania. In the spermatogonial mitoses, the male shows thirteen chromosomes, whereas the female shows twelve in ovarian mitoses (Figs. 1 and 2). The chromosomes of the female can easily be arranged in homologous pairs, one pair (the X-chromosomes) being conspicuous by their long, nearly median, centromere constriction. In the male, ten chromosomes can be paired, but three have no similar partners. These are the X, with a long submedian constriction, the smallest of the set (Y1), and an acrocentric (Y2). The last two chromosomes are not represented in the female. In accord with these observations, five bivalents held together by from one to five chiasmata and a trivalent are formed at the first division of meiosis in the male (Fig. 3). The trivalent is made up of the X, pairing in one of its arms with Y1, and in the other arm with Y2. Orientation on the spindle is always such that Y1 and Y2 are directed to one pole, and the X to the other pole. Two types of sperm are produced, a male-determining type with seven chromosomes, and a female-determining with six. The sex-determining mechanism is, thus, of the XY1Y2 : XX type."

https://openalex.org/W2142365202,"THE concomitance of bone marrow plasmacyte formation and induced hypersensitivity was noted by Kolouch1 in 1938. This was succeeded by a large number of papers indicating the part played by the plasma cell in the secretion of specific antibodies and by clinical studies reporting the strict parallelism between hyperglobulinaemia and plasmacytosis in various diseases. These have been reviewed by Kolouch, Good and Campbell2. The present communication records that the plasmacytosis in the bovine udder is synchronous with heightened periods of immune-body formation at parturition and during experimental cessation of milking."

https://openalex.org/W2025917861,"THE fact that extracts of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland will cause expulsion of milk from the mammary glands of lactating animals has been known for some time1,2. The suggestion that the oxytocic factor is involved in normal milk let-down was made by Ely and Petersen3, though Turner had proposed a theory of milk ejection earlier4 and with Cooper5 presented evidence for the existence of a separate milk-ejection hormone. This evidence was based on the use of a lactating rabbit as an assay animal, and showed that the milk-ejecting activity of whole pituitrin is greater than that of purified oxytocin for a given oxytocic activity, and that the purified pressor preparation is more active than it should be for its oxytocic content."
https://openalex.org/W2143221630,"WE wish to record the finding of considerable amounts of isopropyl alcohol in the blood, milk and rumen contents of cows suffering from acetonæmia, whereas there appears to be none present in normal animals. This means that the figures given hitherto for (β-hydroxybutyric acid in the literature on that condition are probably misleading, as by most of the usual methods of analysis isopropyl alcohol would be estimated with that fraction. Moreover, in view of its close relationship to acetone, isopropyl alcohol might be either a precursor or a metabolic product of that substance. If the former is the case, it would necessitate an entirely new approach to the problem of the development of ketone bodies in this disease."

During the course of studies on the effect of mineral nutrition on the reaction of plants to infection with Verticillium albo-atrum Reinke and Berth, it became necessary to secure systemic infection of young plants without introducing the pathogen through the roots. The following method was therefore devised, using tomatoes as test plants."

https://openalex.org/W2094563908,"WHILE it is well established that solutions of macro-molecular substances may show an anomalous fall in the coefficient of viscosity at high rates of shear, there is much conflict in the experimental evidence relating to the behaviour in this respect of ordinary lubricating oils. It was suggested by Grunberg and Nissan1 that at high rates of shear the viscosity of ordinarily ‘Newtonian’ liquids might become a function of the rate of shear. They developed an equation to account theoretically for this dependence, and calculated that for n-pentane at 30° C. the viscosity should fall sharply over a range of the rate of shear from about 108 to 1011 sec.−1."

https://openalex.org/W2008546294,"DURING studies of aureomycin in human amœbiasis, we observed a remarkable side-effect in those patients who simultaneously harboured Trichomonas intestinalis. Before treatment, these flagellates were present in small numbers only; but they increased considerably after the administration of 3–4 gm. of aureomycin. This increase continued during treatment lasting seven to ten days and was not dependent on the consistency of the stools before or during treatment. In three out of the eight cases observed the increase was enormous; examination of these stools gave the impression of a pure culture of Trichomonas. Though it is known that Trichomonas intestinalis may appear in large numbers in the convalescent stage of bacillary dysentery (Manson-Bahr), it is less frequently observed in amœbic dysentery. We consider the regularity of the increase in eight cases and the enormous numbers occurring in three cases as particularly noteworthy."
https://openalex.org/W2048315051,"NATURALLY occurring rhodium consists almost entirely of one isotope, 45Rh103. No hyperfine structure has previously been found, nor has a determination of the nuclear spin by any other method been made. By passing light from a hollow-cathode tube containing rhodium through an atomic beam of rhodium, we were able to observe absorption in one of the resonance lines, 3434.90 A. (4d85s 4F9/2 – 4d85p 4G11/2)1. The absorption spectrum shows a well-resolved doublet, of splitting 0.023 cm.−1. This proves conclusively that the nuclear spin has the value I = ½, since any other value would produce a quartet or higher multiplet. The splitting of the line must be attributed to the ground-term, which contains an unpaired s-electron. If perfect Russell–Saunders coupling is assumed, the value of the magnetic moment can be calculated by means of the conventional approximation methods. It is found to be − 0.11 nuclear magnetons. This is one of the smallest magnetic moments so far reported."
https://openalex.org/W2048544385,"HAEMOLYTIC streptococci of Lancefield's Group A (Str. pyogenes) can be classified into a number of types on the basis of precipitin reactions with an acid extract of the cocci and appropriate type-specific antisera; the type-specific material in the streptococci is a protein referred to as the M-substance1. It has been a general experience that it is frequently difficult to obtain active extracts from strains of some types, including Type 2. I have found that, if extraction is carried out at neutral pH, and at 120° C. (in an autoclave) instead of at 100° C., satisfactory extracts are obtained with strains of Type 2."
https://openalex.org/W2088052004,"THE recent publication by Aschkenasy-Lelu and Aschkenasy1 of their findings on the effects of folie acid on growth and blood composition in the young rat on a synthetic diet with or without adequate protein has prompted us to record a note on some early observations made on folic acid as a growth-factor. As soon as crystalline folic acid became available for biological research in 1946, an experiment was planned to investigate the effect of folic acid on the growth of rats receiving a synthetic diet. Weanling rats of the black-and-white Lister Institute strain were given at 28 days of age a diet consisting of: with 0.02 ml. cod liver oil daily and 1 ml. of a solution of B vitamins containing, per ml.: Folic acid was administered separately in daily doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 or 8.0 µgm. A positive control group of rats was given a crude liver extract in a daily dose equivalent to 6 gm. original liver."
https://openalex.org/W2088338145,"TRAUB1 appears to have elaborated a killed vaccine capable of evoking an effective immunity against swine erysipelas. It consists essentially of formalin-killed bacterial cells and other antigenic substances present in liquid cultures precipitated by means of aluminium hydroxide gel. However, he does not give his method in sufficient detail to enable it to be faithfully repeated. Nevertheless, he emphasizes that: (1) only certain strains of E. rhusiopathiae are able to produce active vaccine; (2) vaccine activity is dependent upon the precipitation both of the bacterial cells, and of a soluble antigen present in the medium. An efficient vaccine immunizes mice in doses of 0.2 ml. after dilution 1/16, 1/64 or even 1/256 in aluminium hydroxide gel. It also immunizes pigs against experimental infections produced by the method of Fortner and Dinter2 and has given satisfactory results in the field3."

https://openalex.org/W2013046511,"AFTER comparing the action of fluoroacetate on the respiration and citrate utilization in pigeon breast muscle and nematode parasites, Massey and Rogers1 reported that the poison had little action on the pigeon breast muscle. In these experiments, methylene blue, 0.0003–0.0005M, was present in the brei. Later experiments carried out to discover why the fluoroacetate affected the parasite tissue but not the pigeon breast muscle showed that the inhibition obtained was associated with the nature of the oxygen carriers present, and with the oxygen tension at which the experiments were carried out."
https://openalex.org/W2040580706,"THE punctate basophilia in erythrocytes occurring in association with lead poisoning has been interpreted in different ways and its origin still remains unknown. Since the various interpretations have been thoroughly dealt with in several text-books and monographs1–4 they will not be repeated here. It must be emphasized, however, that disagreement exists as to whether punctate basophilia originates in the immature erythroblasts of the bone marrow5 or in the circulating red cells. Neither is it known whether stippled erythrocytes merely represent altered reticulocytes or polychromatic, that is, young erythrocytes."
