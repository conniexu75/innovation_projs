https://openalex.org/W3041206342,"A recently developed pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 bursting in Wuhan, China, has quickly spread across the world. We report the clinical characteristics of 82 cases of death from COVID-19 in a single center. Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital’s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and a large proportion of them were diagnosed with severe illness when admitted. Due to the overwhelming of our system, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in the ICU, 83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support, only 40% had mechanical ventilation support despite 100% needing oxygen and the leading cause of death being pulmonary. Most of the patients who died were male (65.9%). More than half of the patients who died were older than 60 years (80.5%), and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of the patients who died had comorbidities (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), followed by sepsis/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhagic, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), and increased C-reactive protein (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%) levels. A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. The median time from initial symptoms to death was 15 days (IQR 11–20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.037) and time from initial symptoms to death was remarkably observed. Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease and even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but the virus itself and cytokine release syndrome-mediated damage to other organs, including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhagic damage, should be taken seriously as well."
https://openalex.org/W3041914065,"Introduction Early differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without corona virus disease (COVID-19) is very important. Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a RT-PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score ≥3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score ≥2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. Discussion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick tool to categorize patients into “probably positive” and “probably negative” cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3041092136,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the main cause of death among non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Brazil, and they have a high economic impact on health systems. Most populations around the world, including Brazilians, consume excessive sodium, which increases blood pressure and the risk of CVDs.To model the estimated deaths and costs associated with CVDs, which are mediated by increased blood pressure attributable to excessive sodium consumption in adults from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system in 2017.We employed two macrosimulation methods, using top-down approaches and based on the same relative risks. The models estimated the mortality and costs-of-illness attributable to excessive sodium intake and mediated by hypertension for adults aged over 30 years in 2017. Direct healthcare cost data (inpatient care, outpatient care and medications) were extracted from the Ministry of Health information systems and official records.In 2017, an estimated 46,651 deaths from CVDs could have been prevented if the average sodium consumption had been reduced to 2 g/day in Brazil. Premature deaths related to excessive sodium consumption caused 575,172 Years of Life Lost and US$ 752.7 million in productivity losses to the economy. In the same year, the National Health System's costs of hospitalizations, outpatient care and medication for hypertension attributable to excessive sodium consumption totaled US$192.1 million. The main causes of death and costs associated with CVDs were coronary heart disease and stroke, followed by hypertensive disease, heart failure and aortic aneurysm.Excessive sodium consumption is estimated to account for 15% of deaths by CVDs and to 14% of the inpatient and outpatient costs associated with CVD. It also has high societal costs in terms of premature deaths. CVDs are a leading cause of disease and economic burden on the global, regional and country levels. As a largely preventable and treatable conditions, CVDs require the strengthening of cost-effective policies, supported by evidence, including modeling studies, to reduce the costs relating to illness borne by the Brazilian public health system and society."
https://openalex.org/W3040811424,"This study evaluated the communication experiences of critical care nurses while caring for patients in an intensive care unit setting. We have collected qualitative data from 16 critical care nurses working in the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea, through two focus-group discussions and four in-depth individual interviews. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data were analyzed using the Colaizzi’s method. Three themes of nurses’ communication experiences were identified: facing unexpected communication difficulties, learning through trial and error, and recognizing communication experiences as being essential for care. Nurses recognized that communication is essential for quality care. Our findings indicate that critical care nurses should continuously aim to improve their existing skills regarding communication with patients and their care givers and acquire new communication skills to aid patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3041821982,"There is direct evidence for the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza, SARS, measles, and norovirus in locations where large groups of people gather at high densities e.g. theme parks, airports, etc. The mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals in these high people density man-made environments involves pedestrian movement which is generally not taken into account in modeling studies of disease dynamics. We address this problem through a multiscale model that combines pedestrian dynamics with stochastic infection spread models. The pedestrian dynamics model is utilized to generate the trajectories of motion and contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. We incorporate this information into a stochastic infection dynamics model with infection probability and contact radius as primary inputs. This generic model is applicable for several directly transmitted diseases by varying the input parameters related to infectivity and transmission mechanisms. Through this multiscale framework, we estimate the aggregate numbers and probabilities of newly infected people for different winding queue configurations. We find that the queue configuration has a significant impact on disease spread for a range of infection radii and transmission probabilities. We quantify the effectiveness of wall separators in suppressing the disease spread compared to rope separators. Further, we find that configurations with short aisles lower the infection spread when rope separators are used."
https://openalex.org/W3041509240,"Quantification of seasonal dynamics of soil C and N pools is crucial to understand the land management practices for enhancing agricultural sustainability. In a cover crop (CC) experiment established in 2007 and repeated at an adjacent site in 2008, we evaluated the medium-term impact of CC (no cover crop control (no-CC), oat (Avena sativa L.), oilseed radish (OSR, Raphanus sativus L. var. oleoferus Metzg. Stokes), winter cereal rye (rye, Secale cereale L.), and a mixture of OSR+Rye) and crop residue management (residue removed (-R) and residue retained (+R)) on soil C and N dynamics and sequestration. Labile and stable fractions of C and N were determined at seven different time points from 0-15 cm depth during tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) growing season in 2015 and 2016 (referred to as site-years). As expected, over the tomato growing season in both site-years, organic C (OC) and total N did not change while the labile C and N fractions changed with greater concentrations observed at 2 weeks after tillage (WAT) and greater treatment differences observed for seven out of eleven soil attributes at tomato harvest. Therefore, 2WAT (early June) and tomato harvest (early September) are reasonably optimum sampling times for soil C and N attributes. Seasonal variation of labile fractions suggested the potential impact of substrate availability from crop residues on soil C and N cycling. Medium-term CC usage enhanced the surface soil C and N storage. Overall, this study highlights the positive and synergistic influences of CCs and maintaining crop residues in increasing both labile and stable fractions of C and N and enhancing soil quality in a temperate humid climate."
https://openalex.org/W3040895929,"To assess the associations of the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Health Index (ASAS HI) with gender and other factors in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).From November 2017 to October 2018, we measured the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) and the ASAS HI score for AS patients at the Taichung Veterans General Hospital. After adjusting for disease activity (ASDAS-erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], ASDAS- C-reactive protein [CRP], BASDAI+ESR or BASDAI+CRP), mSASSS and other potential confounders including medications, comorbidities, and laboratory data, any associations between gender and the sum score of ASDAS HI were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis, as well as any associations between gender and an ASAS HI score >5 using multivariable logistic regression analysis.A total of 307 AS patients (62 [20.2%] females, mean age 46.4 years [S.D. 13.3], mean symptom duration 20.6 years [S.D. 12.1]) were included. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the male gender was significantly associated with a lower ASAS HI (B = -1. 91, 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.82--1.00, p <0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that males also had a lower risk of achieving scores of ASAS HI > 5 than females (odds ratio = 0.15, 95% CI, 0.07-0.36, p <0.001). Disease activity measures, including ASDAS-ESR, ASDAS-CRP and BASDAI, had positive correlations with ASAS HI.This single-center, cross-sectional study revealed that a higher ASAS HI score was significantly associated with female gender and higher disease activity measures."
https://openalex.org/W3041989688,"Western blotting has been widely used for investigation of protein expression, posttranslational modifications, and interactions. Because western blotting usually involves heat-denaturation of samples prior to gel loading, clarification of detailed procedures for sample preparation have been omitted or neglected in many publications. We show here the case that even excellent primary antibodies failed to detect a specific protein of interest due to a routine heating practice of protein samples. We performed western blotting for transmembrane iron transporter proteins; SLC11A2 (divalent metal transporter 1, DMT1), SLC40A1 (ferroportin 1, Fpn1), and transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), along with cytoplasmic iron storage protein ferritin H. Our results in 12 human culture cell lysates indicated that only unheated samples prior to gel loading gave rise to clear resolution of DMT1 protein, while heated samples (95°C, 5min) caused the loss of resolution due to DMT1 protein aggregates. Unheated samples also resulted in better resolution for Fpn1 and TfR1 western blots. Conversely, only heated samples allowed to detect ferritin H, otherwise ferritin polymers failed to get into the gel. Neither different lysis/sample loading buffers nor sonication improved the resolution of DMT1 and Fpn1 western blots. Thus, heating samples most critically affected the outcome of western blotting, suggesting the similar cases for thousands of other transmembrane and heat-sensitive proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3041258950,"Background Screening and vaccination against Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most effective intervention in curbing the disease. However, there is limited evidence on the factors associated with the uptake of these services in Uganda. This study determined the uptake of HBV screening and vaccination status, and associated factors among Healthcare Providers (HCPs) in Wakiso district, Uganda. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 306 HCPs, randomly selected from 55 healthcare facilities. Prevalence ratios (PR) were used to determine the factors associated with HBV screening and vaccination status of HCPs. Results Of the 306 HCPs, 230 (75.2%) had ever screened for HBV infection while 177 (57.8%) were fully vaccinated. Being male was positively associated with ‘ever been screened’ for HBV infection (Adjusted PR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.13–1.41). Working in a public healthcare facility (Adjusted PR = 0.78, 95%CI 0.68–0.90) was negatively associated with ever been screened. Male sex (Adjusted PR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.01–1.46), the belief that the HBV vaccine was safe (Adjusted PR = 1.72, 95%CI 1.03–2.89) and ever been screened (Adjusted PR = 2.28, 95%CI 1.56–3.34) were positively associated with being fully vaccinated. However, working in a public healthcare facility (Adjusted PR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.64–0.98), self-perceived risk of HBV infection (Adjusted PR = 0.72, 95% CI:0.62–0.84), and working in a healthcare facility with infection control guidelines (Adjusted PR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.66–0.95) were negatively associated with being fully vaccinated. Conclusion Three quarters of HCPs had ever been screened for HBV while slightly more than half were fully vaccinated. HBV screening and vaccination interventions need to consider the HCP sex, risk perception, attitude towards safety and efficacy of the hepatitis B vaccine, and healthcare facility characteristics such as ownership and availability of infection control guidelines, in order to be successful."
https://openalex.org/W3042060575,"We propose an opinion dynamics model based on Latané’s social impact theory. Actors in this model are heterogeneous and, in addition to opinions, are characterised by their varying levels of persuasion and support. The model is tested for two and three initial opinions randomly distributed among actors. We examine how the noise (randomness of behaviour) and the flow of information among actors affect the formation and spread of opinions. Our main research involves the process of opinion formation and finding phases of the system in terms of parameters describing noise and flow of the information for two and three opinions available in the system. The results show that opinion formation and spread are influenced by both (i) flow of information among actors (effective range of interactions among actors) and (ii) noise (randomness in adopting opinions). The noise not only leads to opinions disorder but also it promotes consensus under certain conditions. In disordered phase and when the exchange of information is spatially effectively limited, various faces of disorder are observed, including system states, where the signatures of self-organised criticality manifest themselves as scale-free probability distribution function of cluster sizes. Then increase of noise level leads system to disordered random state. The critical noise level above which histograms of opinion clusters’ sizes loose their scale-free character increases with increase of the easy of information flow."
https://openalex.org/W3040830564,"The characteristics of urban spatial structure and the objective evaluation of the development level of urban economy have always been the concern of urban researchers, However, the spatial relationship between urban spatial structure and urban economic development level is often deliberately ignored. Through the point of interest (POI), the identification framework is constructed, the spatial structure of the city is identified and evaluated, and the Geographically Weighted Regression analysis is carried out with the distribution of unit GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in this study. The research shows that Kunming and Guiyang are polycentric spatial structures and Kunming's structure is more significant. Kunming's economic level is generally higher than Guiyang, but the unit area cannot be compared. The city center will promote the development of the central area in this city, and the more urban centers are distributed within the geographical and spatial range, the greater contribution would have to economic development. In addition, the results of this study will have a positive impact on urban planning and construction, and will also provide a new perspective for the study of cities and related disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W3041873878,"Amplification and sequencing of conserved genetic barcodes such as the cpn60 gene is a common approach to determining the taxonomic composition of microbiomes. Exact sequence variant calling has been proposed as an alternative to previously established methods for aggregation of sequence reads into operational taxonomic units (OTU). We investigated the utility of variant calling for cpn60 barcode sequences and determined the minimum sequence length required to provide species-level resolution. Sequence data from the 5´ region of the cpn60 barcode amplified from the human vaginal microbiome (n = 45), and a mock community were used to compare variant calling to de novo assembly of reads, and mapping to a reference sequence database in terms of number of OTU formed, and overall community composition. Variant calling resulted in microbiome profiles that were consistent in apparent composition to those generated with the other methods but with significant logistical advantages. Variant calling is rapid, achieves high resolution of taxa, and does not require reference sequence data. Our results further demonstrate that 150 bp from the 5´ end of the cpn60 barcode sequence is sufficient to provide species-level resolution of microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3041964165,"Leaves of lettuce, pepper, tomato and grapevine plants grown in greenhouse conditions were exposed to UV-C light for either 60 s or 1 s, using a specific LEDs-based device, and wavelengths and energy were the same among different light treatments. Doses of UV-C light that both effectively stimulated plant defences and were innocuous were determined beforehand. Tomato plants and lettuce plants were inoculated with Botrytis cinerea, pepper plants with Phytophthora capsici, and grapevine with Plasmopara viticola. In some experiments we investigated the effect of a repetition of treatments over periods of several days. All plants were inoculated 48 h after exposure to the last UV-C treatment. Lesions on surfaces were measured up to 12 days after inoculation, depending on the experiment and the pathogen. The results confirmed that UV-C light stimulates plant resistance; they show that irradiation for one second is more effective than irradiation for 60 s, and that repetition of treatments is more effective than single light treatments. Moreover a systemic effect was observed in unexposed leaves that were close to exposed leaves. The mechanisms of perception and of the signalling and metabolic pathways triggered by flashes of UV-C light vs. 60 s irradiation exposures are briefly discussed, as well as the prospects for field use of UV-C flashes in viticulture and horticulture."
https://openalex.org/W3041911301,"There is increasing awareness that self-reported sleep abnormalities are negatively associated with brain structure and function in older adults. Less is known, however, about how objectively measured sleep associates with brain structure. We objectively measured at-home sleep to investigate how sleep architecture and sleep quality related to white matter microstructure in older adults. 43 cognitively normal, older adults underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a sleep assessment within a six-month period. Participants completed the PSQI, a subjective measure of sleep quality, and used an at-home sleep recorder (Zeo, Inc.) to measure total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and percent time in light sleep (LS), deep sleep (DS), and REM sleep (RS). Multiple regressions predicted fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the corpus callosum as a function of total PSQI score, TST, SE, and percent of time spent in each sleep stage, controlling for age and sex. Greater percent time spent in RS was significantly associated with higher FA (β = 0.41, p = 0.007) and lower MD (β = -0.30, p = 0.03). Total PSQI score, TST, SE, and time spent in LS or DS were not significantly associated with FA or MD (p>0.13). Percent time spent in REM sleep, but not quantity of light and deep sleep or subjective/objective measures of sleep quality, positively predicted white matter microstructure integrity. Our results highlight an important link between REM sleep and brain health that has the potential to improve sleep interventions in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3042114242,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an autoimmune disease affecting mainly small blood vessels. B-cells are important in the GPA pathogenesis as precursors of autoantibody-producing cells but likely also contribute (auto)antibody-independently. This has been underlined by the effectiveness of B-cell-depletion (with Rituximab) in inducing and maintaining disease remission. Mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) are immunosuppressive therapies frequently used in GPA-patients. Interestingly, MMF-treated GPA-patients are more prone to relapses than AZA-treated patients, while little is known about the influence of these drugs on B-cells. We investigated whether MMF or AZA treatment (or their active compounds) alters the circulating B-cell subset distribution and has differential effects on in vitro B-cell proliferation and cytokine production in GPA-patients that might underlie the different relapse rate. Circulating B-cell subset frequencies were determined in samples from AZA-treated (n = 13), MMF-treated (n = 12), untreated GPA-patients (n = 19) and matched HCs (n = 41). To determine the ex vivo effects of the active compounds of MMF and AZA, MPA and 6-MP respectively, on B-cell proliferation and cytokine production, PBMCs of untreated GPA-patients (n = 29) and matched HCs (n = 30) were cultured for 3-days in the presence of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) with MPA or 6-MP. After restimulation (with phorbol myristate acetate, calcium-ionophore), cytokine-positive B-cell frequencies were measured. Finally, to assess the effect of MMF or AZA treatment on in vitro B-cell proliferation and cytokine production, PBMCs of MMF-treated (n = 18), and AZA-treated patients (n = 28) and HCs (n = 41) were cultured with CpG. The memory B-cell frequency was increased in AZA- compared to MMF-treated patients, while no other subset was different. The active compounds of MMF and AZA showed in vitro that MPA decreased B-cell proliferation in GPA-patients and HCs. B-cell proliferation in MMF- and AZA-treated patients was not different. Finally, the IL-6+ B-cell frequency was decreased by MPA compared to 6-MP. No differences in IL-10+, IL-6+ or TNFα+ B-cell proportions or proliferation were found in MMF- and AZA-treated patients. Our results indicate that MMF could be superior to AZA in inhibiting B-cell cytokine production in GPA-patients. Future studies should assess the effects of these immunosuppressive drugs on other immune cells to elucidate mechanisms underlying the potential differences in relapse rates."
https://openalex.org/W3041883072,"The vasculature within a tumor is highly disordered both structurally and functionally. Endothelial cells that comprise the vasculature are poorly connected causing vessel leakage and exposing the endothelium to a hypoxic microenvironment. Therefore, most anti-angiogenic therapies are generally inefficient and result in acquired resistance to increased hypoxia due to elimination of the vasculature. Recent studies have explored the efficacy of targeting metabolic pathways in tumor cells in combination with anti-angiogenic therapy. However, the metabolic alterations of endothelial cells in response to hypoxia have been relatively unexplored. Here, we measured polar metabolite levels in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to short- and long-term hypoxia with the goal of identifying metabolic vulnerabilities that can be targeted to normalize tumor vasculature and improve drug delivery. We found that many amino acid-related metabolites were altered by hypoxia exposure, especially within alanine-aspartate-glutamate, serine-threonine, and cysteine-methionine metabolism. Additionally, there were significant changes in de novo pyrimidine synthesis as well as glutathione and taurine metabolism. These results provide key insights into the metabolic alterations that occur in endothelial cells in response to hypoxia, which serve as a foundation for future studies to develop therapies that lead to vessel normalization and more efficient drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3040827810,"Recent studies suggest that we rapidly and effortlessly associate neutral information with the self, leading to subsequent prioritization of this information in perception. However, the exact underlying processes behind these effects are not fully known. Here, we focus specifically on top-down and bottom-up processes involved in self-prioritization, and report results from three experiments involving face detection, using a sequential match-non-match task. Across the three experiments we asked participants to associate an unfamiliar face with the self (Experiment 1), to associate one's face with a stranger's name (Experiment 2), and to establish both associations simultaneously (Experiment 3). We found that while participants showed evidence of bottom-up prioritization of their real faces, they did not show such an effect for self-associated strangers' faces. However, the participants showed a robust self-related top-down effect; when presented with a self-related cue, they were later faster at classifying both subsequent correct and incorrect targets. Together, our results suggest that self-prioritization is underpinned by distinct top-down and bottom-up processes. We discuss our findings in the context of the proposal that the self acts as an ""integrative glue"", and suggest an interpretation of our results within the framework of predictive coding."
https://openalex.org/W3041747099,"The reservoir and source of human campylobacteriosis is primarily considered to be poultry, but also other such as ruminants, pets and environmental sources are related with infection burden. Multilocus sequence typing is often used for Campylobacter epidemiological studies to determine potential sources of human infections. The collection of 420 Campylobacter jejuni isolates with assigned MLST genotype from poultry (n = 139), cattle (n = 48) and wild birds (n = 101) were used in source attribution analysis. Asymmetric island model with accurate and congruent self-attribution results, was used to determine potential sources of human C. jejuni infections (n = 132) in Baltic States. Source attribution analysis revealed that poultry (88.3%) is the main source of C. jejuni human infections followed by cattle and wild bird with 9.4% and 2.3%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that clinical cases of C. jejuni infections in Baltic countries are mainly linked to poultry, but also to cattle and wild bird sources."
https://openalex.org/W3041063435,"Long-term antiretroviral therapy has modified the clinical course of HIV infection to a chronic condition associated with increased risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Information is scant, from sub-Saharan Africa, on the prevalence of NCDs and associated factors among individuals on ART.We consecutively enrolled individuals with HIV infection who were ART naïve and those on ART for ≥5 years (LTART) attending health facilities in Dar es Salaam. Participant's blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, and fasting blood glucose were recorded. Participants with impaired fasting blood glucose underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. A venous blood sample was sent to the lab for biochemical tests. Chi-square test was used to compare proportions, Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to determine associations between variables.Overall, 612 individuals with HIV infection were enrolled, half of whom were ART naïve. Females comprised 71.9% and 68.0% of participants in the LTART and ART naïve study arms, respectively, p = 0.290. The mean age (±SD) was 44.9 ± 12.7 years and 37.5 ± 11.8 years among LTART and ART naïve participants, respectively, p<0.001. Hypertension was documented in 25.2% in those on LTART compared to 6.9% among ART naïve subjects, p<0.001. Impaired glucose tolerance was found in 22.9% and 4.6% among LTART compared to ART naïve subjects, p<0.001. Diabetes mellitus was detected in 17.0% of those on LTART compared to 3.9% ART naïve participants, p<0.001. Hypercholesterolemia was found in 30.4% of individuals on LTART compared to 16.7% of ART naïve subjects, p<0.001, and hypertriglyceridemia was found in 16.0% of participants on LTART compared to 9.5% of ART naïve, p = 0.015. LTART use, age ≥40 years, history of smoking, and body mass index were independently associated with NCDs.Hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were associated with long-term use of antiretroviral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3041733843,"Macrophages are key phagocytic cells and play an important role in eliminating external microorganisms and endogenous danger signals. Dysregulation in macrophage functions have been reported in patients with asthma. Zinc homeostasis is critical in maintaining macrophage functions. The solute carrier (SLC) protein SLC39A7, a Zn2+ importer, has recently been linked to asthma. However, the roles of SLC39A7 in macrophage phagocytosis are not well understood. Here we found that phagocytosis efficiency was significantly decreased in SLC39A7-knockdown THP-1 cells, however the phagocytosis capability could be reversed with zinc supplementation. SLC39A7 deficiency skewed macrophages towards alternative activation, as indicated by increased expression of M2 activation marker CD206 and decreased expression of M1 activation marker NOS2. Consistent to this result, SLC39A7-knockdown cells produced reduced amounts of proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-6. Furthermore, the mRNA level of receptor Clec4e previously known to be involved in phagocytosis of BCG was significantly reduced in SLC39A7 knockdown cells. Importantly, all these defects due to SLC39A7 deficiency could be reversed by zinc supplementation. Thus, zinc transporter SLC39A7 provide support for phagocytosis and classical macrophage activation."
https://openalex.org/W3042005573,"Three-dimensional liver in vitro systems have recently attracted a lot of attention in drug development. These systems help to gain unprecedented insights into drug-induced liver injury (DILI), as they more closely reproduce liver biology, and as drug effects can be studied in isolated and controllable microenvironments. Many groups established human-based in vitro models but so far neglected the animal equivalent, although the availability of both models would be desirable. Animal in vitro models enable back- and forward translation of in vitro and in vivo findings, bridge the gap between rodent in vivo and human in vitro scenarios, and ultimately support the interpretation of data generated with preclinical species and humans. Since mice are often used in drug development and physiologically relevant in vitro systems are lacking, we established, for the first time, a mouse liver model that encompasses primary parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells with preserved viability and functionality over three weeks. Using our three-dimensional liver spheroids, we were able to predict the toxicity of known DILI compounds, demonstrated the interaction cascades between the different cell types and showed evidence of drug-induced steatosis and cholestasis. In summary, our mouse liver spheroids represent a valuable in vitro model that can be applied to study DILI findings, reported from mouse studies, and offers the potential to detect immune-mediated drug-induced liver toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3042146251,"The interactions between entomopathogenic fungi and insects serve a classic example of a co-evolutionary arms race between pathogens and their target host. The cuticle, site of the first contact between insects and entomopathogenic fungus, is an important defensive barrier against pathogens. It is covered by a layer of lipids that appears to play a key role in these processes and cuticular free fatty acid (FFA) profiles are consider as a determinant of susceptibility, or resistance, to fungal infections. These profiles are species-specific. The cockroaches Blattella germanica (Blattodea: Blattidae) and Blatta orientalis (Blattodea: Ectobiidae) are unsusceptible to the soil fungus Conidiobolus coronatus (Entomophthorales: Ancylistaceae) infection, therefore we studied the profiles of FFAs in order to understand the defensive capabilities of the cockroaches. The fungus was cultivated for three weeks in minimal medium. Cell-free filtrate was obtained, assayed for elastase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, chitobiosidase and lipase activity, and then used for in vitro hydrolysis of the cuticle from wings and thoraces of adults and oothecae. The amounts of amino acids, N-glucosamine and FFAs released from the hydrolysed cuticle samples were measured after eight hours of incubation. The FFA profiles of the cuticle of adults, and the wings, thoraces and oothecae of both species were established using GC-MS and the results were correlated with the effectiveness of fungal proteases, chitinases and lipases in the hydrolyzation of cuticle samples. Positive correlations would suggest the existence of compounds used by the fungus as nutrients, whereas negative correlations may indicate that these compounds could be engaged in insect defence."
https://openalex.org/W3042147195,"The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a large structural and functional MRI dataset with a rich array of behavioral and genotypic measures, as well as a biologically verified family structure. This makes it a valuable resource for investigating questions about individual differences, including questions about heritability. While its MRI data have been analyzed extensively in this regard, to our knowledge a comprehensive estimation of the heritability of the behavioral dataset has never been conducted. Using a set of behavioral measures of personality, emotion and cognition, we show that it is possible to re-identify the same individual across two testing times (fingerprinting), and to identify identical twins significantly above chance. Standard heritability estimates of 37 behavioral measures were derived from twin correlations, and machine-learning models (univariate linear model, Ridge classifier and Random Forest model) were trained to classify monozygotic twins and dizygotic twins. Correlations between the standard heritability metric and each set of model weights ranged from 0.36 to 0.7, and questionnaire-based and task-based measures did not differ significantly in their heritability. We further explored the heritability of a smaller number of latent factors extracted from the 37 measures and repeated the heritability estimation; in this case, the correlations between the standard heritability and each set of model weights were lower, ranging from 0.05 to 0.43. One specific discrepancy arose for the general intelligence factor, which all models assigned high importance, but the standard heritability calculation did not. We present a thorough investigation of the heritabilities of the behavioral measures in the HCP as a resource for other investigators, and illustrate the utility of machine-learning methods for qualitative characterization of the differential heritability across diverse measures."
https://openalex.org/W3042104188,"The automatic detection of facial expressions of pain is needed to ensure accurate pain assessment of patients who are unable to self-report pain. To overcome the challenges of automatic systems for determining pain levels based on facial expressions in clinical patient monitoring, a surface electromyography method was tested for feasibility in healthy volunteers. In the current study, two types of experimental gradually increasing pain stimuli were induced in thirty-one healthy volunteers who attended the study. We used a surface electromyography method to measure the activity of five facial muscles to detect facial expressions during pain induction. Statistical tests were used to analyze the continuous electromyography data, and a supervised machine learning was applied for pain intensity prediction model. Muscle activation of corrugator supercilii was most strongly associated with self-reported pain, and the levator labii superioris and orbicularis oculi showed a statistically significant increase in muscle activation when the pain stimulus reached subjects' self -reported pain thresholds. The two strongest features associated with pain, the waveform length of the corrugator supercilii and levator labii superioris, were selected for a prediction model. The performance of the pain prediction model resulted in a c-index of 0.64. In the study results, the most detectable difference in muscle activity during the pain experience was connected to eyebrow lowering, nose wrinkling and upper lip raising. As the performance of the prediction model remains modest, yet with a statistically significant ordinal classification, we suggest testing with a larger sample size to further explore the variables that affect variation in expressiveness and subjective pain experience."
https://openalex.org/W3041230641,"Biomedical ontologies have been growing quickly and proven to be useful in many biomedical applications. Important applications of those data include estimating the functional similarity between ontology terms and between annotated biomedical entities, analyzing enrichment for a set of biomedical entities. Many semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods have been proposed for such applications. Also, a number of tools implementing the methods have been developed on different platforms. However, these tools have implemented a small number of the semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods for a certain type of biomedical ontology. Note that the methods can be applied to all types of biomedical ontologies. More importantly, each method can be dominant in different applications; thus, users have more choice with more number of methods implemented in tools. Also, more functions would facilitate their task with ontology.In this study, we developed a Cytoscape app, named UFO, which unifies most of the semantic similarity measures for between-term and between-entity similarity calculation for all types of biomedical ontologies in OBO format. Based on the similarity calculation, UFO can calculate the similarity between two sets of entities and weigh imported entity networks as well as generate functional similarity networks. Besides, it can perform enrichment analysis of a set of entities by different methods. Moreover, UFO can visualize structural relationships between ontology terms, annotating relationships between entities and terms, and functional similarity between entities. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of UFO through some case studies on finding the best semantic similarity measures for assessing the similarity between human disease phenotypes, constructing biomedical entity functional similarity networks for predicting disease-associated biomarkers, and performing enrichment analysis on a set of similar phenotypes.Taken together, UFO is expected to be a tool where biomedical ontologies can be exploited for various biomedical applications.UFO is distributed as a Cytoscape app, and can be downloaded freely at Cytoscape App (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/ufo) for non-commercial use."
https://openalex.org/W3041431501,"Background Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a minimally invasive fully reversible therapy that was approved in 1997 for overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) refractory to behavior modification and pharmacotherapy. Despite being in use for over two decades, the data on medium to long-term safety and efficacy of SNM in OAB is limited. We investigated the medium-term efficacy and safety of SNM along with the predictive factors for its success in patients with refractory OAB. Methods A retrospective consecutive case series of 66 patients undergoing SNM for refractory OAB between July 2009 and July 2018. All patients underwent a test period followed by permanent implantation, if there was > = 50% improvement in any symptom. The primary outcome was “success” defined as > = 50% improvement in any clinical parameter based on the subjective assessment of patient’s response. The secondary outcomes were number of pads used in 24 hours, post-operative complications and re-operation rates. Results 66 females with an average age of 62.7 years were included. 55/66 patients (83.3%) had a successful test phase and underwent permanent implantation. After a median follow-up of 32 months, SNM was successful in 41/55 (74.5%) patients. Mean number of pads used in 24 hours decreased significantly from 3.5 preoperatively to 1.2 at last follow-up (p<0.001). 8/55 (14.5%) patients reported complications of pain, lead migration, wound dehiscence and device malfunction. 10/55 (18.2%) patients underwent revision surgeries after a median duration of 21.9 months. Device was explanted in 15/55 (27.3%) patients after a median duration of 24 months. No significant predictor for success was identified. Conclusions The success rate of SNM is 75% with a complication rate of 14.5% after a median follow-up of ~3 years. This study suggests medium-term efficacy and safety but a high re-operation rate of SNM in patients with refractory OAB."
https://openalex.org/W3041790133,"Accurate information about the spatiotemporal variability of actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa), crop coefficient (Kc) and water productivity (WP) is crucial for water efficient management in the agriculture. The Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux) application has become a popular approach for providing spatiotemporal information on ETa and Kc worldwide. The aim of this study was to quantify the variability of water consumption (ETa) and the Kc for an irrigated commercial planting of soybeans based on the EEFlux application in the western region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The water productivity (WP) for the fields was also obtained. Six cloud-free images from Landsat 7 and 8 satellites, acquired during the 2016/17 soybean growing season were used and processed on the EEFlux platform. The ETa from EEFlux was compared to that of the modified FAO (MFAO) approach using the following statistical metrics: Willmot’s index of agreement (d-index), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean bias error (MBE). The Kc from EEFlux was compared to the Kc used in the soybean field (Kc FAO-based) and to the Kc values obtained in different scientific studies using the d-index. A similar procedure was performed for WP. Our results reveal that EEFlux is able to provide accurate information about the variability of ETa and the Kc of soybean fields. The comparison between ETa EEFlux and ETa MFAO showed good agreement based on the d-index, with values of 0.85, 0.83 and 0.89 for central pivots 1, 2 and 3, respectively. However, EEFlux tends to slightly underestimate ETa. The Kc EEFlux showed good accordance with the Kc values considered in this study, except in phase II, where a larger difference was observed; the average WP of the three fields (1.14 kg m-3) was higher than that in the majority of the previous studies, which is a strong indicator of the efficient use of water in the studied soybean fields. The study showed that EEFlux, an innovative and free tool for access spatiotemporal variability of ETa and Kc at global scale is very efficient to estimate the ETa and Kc on different growth stages of soybean crop."
https://openalex.org/W3041867541,"Analyses of health over time must consider the potential impacts of ageing as well as any effects relating to cohort differences. The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and Understanding Society longitudinal studies are employed to assess trends in mental ill-health over a 26-year period. This analysis uses cross-classified multilevel models in an exploratory, non-parametric approach to evaluate age and cohort effects net of each other. Mental ill-health evidences an initial worsening trend as people age which then reverses and exhibits improvement in late-middle-age, before declining again in the latter stages of life. There were less defined cohort trends. The modelling technique also reveals the relative importance of the temporal contexts in relation to inter- and intra-individual effects on mental ill-health, demonstrating that the ageing and cohort dimensions explain little variation compared to these more dominant within and between influences. Ultimately, we suggest that researchers would benefit from wider use of this exploratory modelling strategy when evaluating underlying health trends and more research is now needed to explore potential explanations of these baseline trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W3041905875,"The current knowledge of the half-lives (T1/2) of several radiolanthanides is either affected by a high uncertainty or is still awaiting confirmation. The scientific information deriving from this imprecise T1/2 data has a significant impact on a variety of research fields, e.g., astrophysics, fundamental nuclear sciences, and nuclear energy and safety. The main reason for these shortcomings in the nuclear databases is the limited availability of suitable sample material together with the difficulties in performing accurate activity measurements with low uncertainties. In reaction to the urgent need to improve the current nuclear databases, the long-term project “ERAWAST” (Exotic Radionuclides from Accelerator Waste for Science and Technology) was launched at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). In this context, we present a wet radiochemical separation procedure for the extraction and purification of dysprosium (Dy), terbium (Tb), gadolinium (Gd), and samarium (Sm) fractions from highly radioactive tantalum specimens, in order to obtain 154Dy, 157-158Tb, 148,150Gd, and 146Sm samples, needed for T1/2 determination studies. Ion-exchange chromatography was successfully applied for the separation of individual lanthanides. All separations were conducted in aqueous phase. The separation process was monitored via γ-spectrometry using suitable radioactive tracers. Both the purity and the quantification of the desired radiolanthanides were assessed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Test experiments revealed that, prior to the Dy, Tb, Gd, and Sm separation, the removal of hafnium, lutetium, and barium from the irradiated tantalum material was necessary to minimize the overall dose rate exposure (in the mSv/h range), as well to obtain pure lanthanide fractions. With the herein proposed separation method, exotic 154Dy, 157-158Tb, 148,150Gd, and 146Sm radionuclides were obtained in sufficient amounts and purity for the preparation of samples for envisaged half-life measurements. During the separation process, fractions containing holmium, europium, and promethium radionuclides were collected and stored for further use."
https://openalex.org/W3040961929,"Background To determine the added value of preoperative prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) supplementary to clinical variables and their role in predicting post prostatectomy adverse findings and biochemically recurrent cancer (BCR). Methods All consecutive patients treated at HUS Helsinki University Hospital with robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP) between 2014 and 2015 were included in the analysis. The mpMRI data, clinical variables, histopathological characteristics, and follow-up information were collected. Study end-points were adverse RALP findings: extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, and BCR. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score and the Partin score were combined with any adverse findings at mpMRI. Predictive accuracy for adverse RALP findings by the regression models was estimated before and after the addition of MRI results. Logistic regression, area under curve (AUC), decision curve analyses, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used. Results Preoperative mpMRI data from 387 patients were available for analysis. Clinical variables alone, MSKCC nomogram or Partin tables were outperformed by models with mpMRI for the prediction of any adverse finding at RP. AUC for clinical parameters versus clinical parameters and mpMRI variables were 0.77 versus 0.82 for any adverse finding. For MSKCC nomogram versus MSKCC nomogram and mpMRI variables the AUCs were 0.71 and 0.78 for any adverse finding. For Partin tables versus Partin tables and mpMRI variables the AUCs were 0.62 and 0.73 for any adverse finding. In survival analysis, mpMRI-projected adverse RP findings stratify CAPRA and MSKCC high-risk patients into groups with distinct probability for BCR. Conclusions Preoperative mpMRI improves the predictive value of commonly used clinical variables for pathological stage at RP and time to BCR. mpMRI is available for risk stratification prebiopsy, and should be considered as additional source of information to the standard predictive nomograms."
https://openalex.org/W3041520415,"Integration of tuberculosis and HIV services in many resource-limited settings, including Ghana, has been far from optimal despite the existence of policy frameworks for integration. A previous study among programme managers and other stakeholders at the national level has documented tardiness in committing to the integration of services. In this paper, we aimed at unravelling pertinent challenges that confront TB-HIV integrated service delivery. Data were obtained from interviews with 31 individual health care providers operating under different models of TB-HIV service delivery. The study is framed around the Complexity Theory. We applied inductive and deductive techniques to code the data and validations were done through inter-rater mechanisms. The analysis was done with the assistance of QSR NVivo version 12. We found evidence of a convivial working relationship between TB-HIV service providers at the facility level. However, the interactions vary across models of care-the lesser the level of integration, the lesser the complexities for interactions that ensued. This had resulted in operational challenges on account of how the two-disease environment interacts with the other components of the health system. These challenges included; weak/inappropriate infrastructure, frail coordination between the two programmes and hospital administrators, under-staffing in comprehensive TB-HIV management, use of community facility under the Directly-Observed Treatment (DOT) protocols, and financial constraints. To fully appropriate the enormous benefits of TB-HIV service integration, there is a need to address these challenges."
https://openalex.org/W3041782397,"Background In many countries, medical interventions are reimbursed on the basis of recommendations made by advisory boards and committees that apply multiple criteria in their assessment procedures. Given the diversity of these criteria, it is difficult to find common ground to determine what information is required for setting priorities. Objective To investigate whether society and patients share the same interests and views concerning healthcare priorities. Methods We applied a framework of discrete choice models in which respondents were presented with judgmental tasks to elicit their preferences. They were asked to choose between two hypothetical scenarios of patients receiving a new treatment. The scenarios graphically presented treatment outcomes and patient characteristics. Responses were collected through an online survey administered among respondents from the general population (N = 1,253) and patients (N = 1,389) and were analyzed using conditional logit and mixed logit models. Results The respondents’ preferences regarding new medical treatments revealed that they attached the most relative importance to additional survival years, age at treatment, initial health condition, and the cause of disease. Minor differences in the relative importance assigned to three criteria: age at treatment, initial health, and cause of disease were found between the general population and patient samples. Health scenarios in which patients had higher initial health-related quality of life (i.e., a lower burden of disease) were favored over those in which patients’ initial health-related quality of life was lower. Conclusions Overall, respondents within the general population expressed preferences that were similar to those of the patients. Therefore, priority-setting studies that are based on the perspectives of the general population may be useful for informing decisions on reimbursement and other types of priority-setting processes in health care. Incorporating the preferences of the general population may simultaneously increase public acceptance of these decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3041963972,"Positive affect is associated with alleviating mental and physiological stress responses. As laughter is a common physiological operationalization of positive affect, we investigated whether the effects of experiencing a stressful event on stress symptoms is lessened by frequency and intensity of daily laughter. Using an intensive longitudinal design, we ambulatory assessed the self-reported experience of stressful events, stress symptoms and the frequency as well as the intensity of laughter in university students' daily lives. Our hierarchical ecological momentary assessment data were analyzed with multilevel models. The results support the stress-buffering model of positive affect: We found that the frequency of laughter attenuated the association between stressful events and subsequent stress symptoms. The level of intensity of laughter, however, was found to have no significant effect. Future studies should use additional psychophysiological indicators of stress and straighten out the differential contributions of frequency and intensity of daily laughter."
https://openalex.org/W3041047727,"Canine hip dysplasia (HD) is a complex developmental disease of the coxo-femoral joint and is one of the most common orthopedic conditions in dogs. Due to the genetic contribution, most of the programs fighting against HD recommend selective breeding that excludes affected dogs. Using the best-scoring dogs for breeding may reduce the prevalence of HD. In France, the phenotypic screening of coxo-femoral joint conformation remains a strategy for breeders to establish selection decisions. The HD prevalence was evaluated in 10 breeds, based on the assessment of 27,710 dogs, during the 1997–2017 screening period, which was divided into 3 homogeneous cohorts for analysis. The global HD prevalence varied widely among breeds from 5% (Siberian Husky) to 51.9% (Cane Corso). It decreased over time in 6 breeds, among which 4 (Cane Corso, Gordon Setter, Rottweiler and White Swiss Shepherd) showed a significant decrease. A statistically significant increase in HD prevalence was noted for the Siberian Husky. Although the efficacy of phenotype-based breeding programs remains controversial, our results are in accordance with several recent studies showing that long-term selection policies are valuable, as they may help decreasing the HD prevalence in some breeds. The complementary use of more recent tools such as estimated breeding values and genomics would probably help breeders achieve more substantive results."
https://openalex.org/W3042012649,"The goal of this study was to compare how infants’ non-nutritive suck (NNS) changes throughout a suck sample. Fifty-four full-term infants (57% male) completed this study at, on average, 3.03 (SD .31) months of age. These infants sucked on our custom research pacifier for approximately five minutes. Infants produced, on average, 14.50 suck bursts during the sample. NNS data was pooled across subjects and breakpoint analyses were completed to determine if there were changes in their NNS patterning. Breakpoints were evident for NNS cycles per burst at burst numbers 18 and 34, and for amplitude (cmH20) at burst numbers 18 and 29. No breakpoints were present for NNS frequency. Infants exhibit changes in their suck physiology across burst number. When assessing suck, developmental specialists should observe more than one suck burst to attain a more valid and appropriate scope of the infant’s suck ability."

Before and after the task, grip strength was assessed using a hand-grip dynamometer and touch-pressure sensitivity was measured (shoulder, hand) using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments.Older, but not young adults, had increased touch-pressure sensitivity at the shoulder after fatigue (interaction, p = 0.007). No changes in grip strength were observed (p>0.05). Task fatigability was not different between young and old adults (p>0.05). Having less task fatigability was associated with lower PF, higher grip strength, and higher touch-pressure sensitivity at the hand (ρ = 0.37-0.58, p<0.05), with the hand sensation association also observed in the old adult subgroup (ρ = 0.56, p = 0.046).With old age, there were fatigue-related alterations to sensory but not physical function. While task fatigability was associated with perceptual, physical, and sensory features, sensory features appear to have a more important role with old age."

Bibliographic records for a total of 260 articles, published during through December 2018, were retrieved from the Web of Science (core database). All data were analysed using Microsoft Excel (2013), Web of Science platform and CiteSpace. A series of network analysis were then run for each time-period using the link reduction method and pathfinder network scaling. The co-cited articles were clustered into their homogeneous research clusters. The clusters were named using the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) method that utilized author keywords as source of names for these clusters. The scientometric analyses of original research output from these birth cohorts also paint a pessimistic landscape in Pakistan- where Pakistani sites for birth cohorts contributed only 31 publications; a majority of these utilized the MAL-ED birth cohort data. A majority of original studies were published from birth cohorts in India (156), Bangladesh (63), and Nepal (15). Out of these contributions, 31 studies reported data from multiple countries. The three major birth cohorts include prospective and multi-country MAL-ED birth cohort and The Pakistan Early Childhood Development Scale Up Trial, and a retrospective Maternal and infant nutrition intervention cohort. In addition to these, a few small-scale birth cohorts reported findings pertaining to neonatal sepsis, intrauterine growth retardation and its effects on linear growth of children and environmental enteropathy."
https://openalex.org/W3041664744,"We tested whether post-fire seedling establishment of common boreal tree and expanding shrub species at treeline and in Arctic tundra is facilitated by co-migration of boreal forest mycorrhizal fungi. Wildfires are anticipated to facilitate biome shifts at the forest-tundra ecotone by improving seedbed conditions for recruiting boreal species; at the same time fire alters the composition and availability of mycorrhizal fungi critical to seedling performance. To determine the role of root-associated fungi (RAF) in post-fire seedling recruitment and future biome shifts, we outplanted four dominant boreal tree and shrub species inoculated with one of three treatments at treeline and in tundra: burned boreal forest, unburned boreal forest, or a control treatment of sterilized inoculum. We compared survivorship, growth, and physiological performance of the seedlings in relation to mycorrhizal inoculum treatment and among host species, characterized the RAF communities based on ITS-rDNA sequencing of individual root tips sampled from surviving seedlings, and tested for correlations between RAF composition and the inoculation treatments, host species, and duration of the experiment. We explored correlations between RAF composition and seedling metrics. Both live and sterile autoclaved inoculation treatments had similar effects on seedling survivorship and growth for all species. RAF composition did not vary by treatment, suggesting that most colonization was due to local fungi. However, seedling traits and growth were correlated with RAF species composition, colonization, and the relative abundance of specific RAF taxa. Picea sp. performance in particular showed strong co-variation with RAF metrics. Our results suggest that mycorrhizal co-migration is not a primary limiting factor to boreal seedling recruitment because the experimental provision of inoculum did not affect seedling recruitment; yet, RAF did influence seedling performance, particularly resident RAF at treeline and in tundra, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi are important to vegetation processes at the treeline-tundra ecotone."
https://openalex.org/W3040984350,"There is a dearth of information on induced abortion in Ghana, possibly owing to the sensitive nature of the subject. In this study, we examine the effect of socioeconomic and contextual factors on induced abortion in Ghana. This study draws on data from the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey. The study used a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression analysis to estimate both individual- and contextual-level factors affecting induced abortion levels in Ghana. The results show a total induced abortion prevalence of 19.6% coupled with considerable district-level disparities. Induced abortion is significantly associated with socioeconomic factors such as educational attainment, wealth status, and marital status at the individual-level. The risk of induced abortion is considerably higher among the educated, wealthy, and cohabiting women. The current age of women, age at first sex, religious affiliation, parity, and type of residence are the demographic factors having an association with induced abortion levels. At the contextual-level, district health insurance coverage and poverty rate have a significant association with induced abortion. Induced abortion appears to be prevalent in Ghana and is underpinned by both individual-level socioeconomic and aggregate-level factors. Addressing induced abortion levels in Ghana may require policies that take a multilevel approach by focusing on the socioeconomic status of women and district-level contextual factors."
https://openalex.org/W3042051223,"Background Unintended pregnancy rates are substantially higher in developing regions, have significant health consequences, and disproportionately affect subgroups with socio-economic disadvantage. We aimed to examine whether there is an association between husbands’ education status and their wives unintended pregnancy in southern Ethiopia. Methods The data source for this study was from a cross-sectional study on iron-folate supplementation and compliance in Wolaita, South Ethiopia. Data were collected from October to November 2015 in 627 married pregnant women regarding their husbands’ education status, socio-demographic characteristics, and if they wanted to become pregnant at the time of survey using an interviewer administered questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to estimate Odds Ratios (ORs) with associated z-tests and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) for variables associated with unintended pregnancy. Results The proportion of unintended pregnancy in this sample was 20.6%. Husbands’ education status, age, residence, and using family planning methods were associated with unintended pregnancy (all P-values < 0.05). Multivariable models consistently showed that being married to a husband with at least some college or university education was associated with a decreased OR for unintended pregnancy after controlling for age and use of family planning at conception period (OR 0.36 [95%CI: 0.17, 0.82]) and age and rural residence (OR 0.40 [95%CI: 0.18, 0.90]). Conclusion Unintended pregnancy among Ethiopian woman was consistently associated with being married to least educated husbands in southern Ethiopia. Increasing age and living in a rural vs urban area were also independently associated with unintended pregnancy. Strategies for addressing family planning needs of women with poorly educated husbands should be the subject of future research."
https://openalex.org/W3042154736,"Glutamate is the most excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and it is involved in the initiation and maintaining of waking and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Homer proteins act in the trafficking and/or clustering of metabotropic glutamate receptors, and polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene have been associated with phenotypes related to glutamate signaling dysregulation. In this study, we report the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the HOMER1 gene (rs3822568) with specific aspects of sleep in a sample of the Brazilian population. To accomplish this, 1,042 individuals were subjected to a full-night polysomnography, and a subset of 983 subjects had rs3822568 genotyping data available. When compared with the A allele carriers, GG genotyped individuals showed higher sleep latency, lower sleep efficiency, reduced number of arousals per hour, lower apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and lower theta spectral power. In summary, the present findings suggest that the rs3822568 polymorphism in the HOMER1 gene is associated with sleep EEG profiles and might have an impact on sleep quality and sleep structure, with potential to explain inter-individual variation in sleep homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3040974965,"In most temperate fruit trees, fruits are located on one-year old shoots. In Prunus species, flowers and fruits are born in axillary position along those shoots. The axillary bud fate and branching patterns are thus key components of the cultivar potential fruit production. The objective of this study was to analyze the branching and bearing behaviors of 1-year-old shoots of apricot cultivars and clones genetically closely related. Shoot structures were analyzed in terms of axillary bud fates using hidden semi-Markov chains and compared depending on the genotype, year and shoot length. The shoots were composed of three successive zones containing latent buds (basal zone), central flower buds (median zone) and vegetative buds (distal zone), respectively. The last two zones contained few associated flower buds. The zones length (in number of metamers) and occurrence strongly depended on shoot development in the two successive years. With decrease in the number of metamers per shoot, the last two zones become shorter or may not develop. While the number of metamers of the basal and distal zones and the number of associated flower buds correlated to the number of metamers of the shoot, the number of metamers of the median zone and the transition probability from the median to the distal zone were cultivar specific."
https://openalex.org/W3041403943,"The relationships between spatial production, urbanization and sustainable development are becoming a focus of the international academic cycle. Urbanization dominated by spatial production driven by capital and power often produces and enlarges uneven development, which leads to multiple eco-environmental problems. Thus, the key to development lies in whether the pattern of urbanization is in harmony with the ecological environment. However, previous researches mainly concentrate on spatial production in developed countries or regions. The urbanization and sustainable development of less-developed regions, with complex and fragile ecological environments, are often overlooked. It is a new idea to explain the relationships and interactions between spatial production, urbanization and sustainable development based on less-developed regions by the theory of spatial production. The paper chooses the Hexi Corridor as a typical case, puts forward a conceptual framework and explores the process of spatial production from 2000 to 2017. The results reveal that urbanization in the Hexi Corridor is a multidimensional socio-spatial process: power and capital gave birth to a higher urbanization and accelerated the process of urbanization, however, the urban-rural gap between regions has not narrowed accordingly. Driven by comprehensive interests, local governments often take some extreme measures to forcefully promote the urbanization process, thereby violating the goals and requirements of sustainable development. At present, there is an urgent need to coordinate the relationship between urban and rural regions on different scales and transform the urbanization model from traditional spatial production to a new-type of urbanization with people-oriented and sustainable development."

Experimentally, the lack of pulsatility alters myogenic tone of resistance arteries and increases the parietal inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to compare the vascular reactivity of the internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) due to the inflammatory response between patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) under CPB with a roller pump or with a centrifugal pump. Methods Eighty elective male patients undergoing CABG were selected using one or two internal thoracic arteries under CPB with a roller pump (RP group) or centrifugal pump (CFP group). ITA samples were collected before starting CPB (Time 1) and before the last coronary anastomosis during aortic cross clamping (Time 2). The primary endpoint was the endothelium-dependent relaxation of ITAs investigated using wire-myography. The secondary endpoint was the parietal inflammatory response of arteries defined by the measurements of superoxide levels, leukocytes and lymphocytes rate and gene expression of inflammatory proteins using. Terminal complement complex activation (SC5b-9) and neutrophil activation (elastase) analysis were performed on arterial blood at the same times. Results Exposure time of ITAs to the pump flow was respectively 43.3 minutes in the RP group and 45.7 minutes in the CFP group. Acetylcholine-dependent relaxation was conserved in the two groups whatever the time. Gene expression of C3 and C4a in the artery wall decreased from Time 1 to Time 2. No oxidative stress was observed in the graft. There was no difference between the groups concerning the leukocytes and lymphocytes rate. SC5b-9 and elastase increased between Time 1 and Time 2. Conclusion Endothelium-dependent relaxation of the internal thoracic arteries was preserved during CPB whatever the type of pump used. The inflammatory response observed in the blood was not found in the graft wall within this time frame.

https://openalex.org/W3041851539,"Xylocopa valga is extinct in Latvia and Lithuania and is critically endangered in Poland, and its distribution in the Ejina Oasis, China, is currently unknown. Studies on the biology of X. valga are scarce, and thus, conservation efforts for this species are currently limited. Here, we investigated the morphological characteristics, nest architecture, nest structure and food type of offspring in the nest cells of X. valga. This research was conducted in the Populus euphratica forest reserve in the Ejina Oasis, China, between July 2014 and June 2019. The primary investigation methods included visual inspection, photography, observation and measurements of nest anatomy, and examination of pollen stores by microscopy. We found that in the Ejina Oasis, China, X. valga builds its nests in the dead wood of P. euphratica. X. valga is univoltine. Its lifestyle varies from solitude to symbiosis. When many females nest near each other, several females may share a single nest entrance, based on which they build their own cells. The nests are branched. According to our results, there is a significant difference between the thickness of the inner cell partition and that of the outermost cell partition in the branched tunnel. In the P. euphratica forest area, the food for the progeny of X. valga is mainly composed of the pollen and nectar of Sophora alopecuroide and Populus euphratica. Therefore, X. valga and S. alopecuroides exhibit close ecological interactions in the P. euphratica forest ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3041870587,"Introduction In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated guidelines recommending universal, one-time hepatitis C virus screening for all individuals born between 1945 and 1965. Prior to the implementation of these guidelines, testing rates were inappropriately low, but unnecessary duplicate antibody testing was also problematic. In the era of increased efforts to screen “baby boomers”, the prevalence and social determinants of initial and duplicate hepatitis C testing have not been well described. Methods A hepatitis C screening program was implemented at six urban primary care clinics affiliated with Drexel University College of Medicine. Data was collected regarding the screening patterns in these clinics. Annual screening rates for the program were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association of demographic variables and the outcomes of subjects having ever been tested and subjects having received duplicate testing. Results Following the implementation of the program, the screening rate increased from 16% in the first year of analysis to 82% in the final year of analysis. Of the 6,717 patients screened, 1,207 had duplicate testing, of which 14% had inappropriate duplicate antibody screening. African Americans and Asian patients had a higher odds of being screened. Patients with public insurance had a higher odds of duplicate screening. Conclusions In the setting of an aggressive hepatitis C screening program, high testing rates may be attained in a target population. However, inappropriate duplicate antibody testing rates may be high, which may be a burden in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3041135615,"Thus far, no curved linear array endoscopic ultrasound (CLAEUS) findings were established as predictors of difficult selective bile duct cannulation (SBDC). This study aimed to identify CLAEUS findings to predict endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) cases with difficult SBDC. This single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted between July 2014 and June 2017. This study included all consecutive patients who underwent CLAEUS prior to naïve ERCP. A CLAEUS finding of the simultaneous depiction of bile and pancreatic ducts at the second portion of the duodenum (D2) (simultaneous depiction) was selected as a possible predictor of difficult SBDC, and the κ values in the evaluation of inter- and intra-observer variabilities for ""simultaneous depiction"" were 0.65 and 0.77, respectively, with substantial correlation. Among the 986 patients who underwent ERCP, 80 patients were relevant for evaluation. Logistic regression analysis revealed strong association between ""simultaneous depiction"" and difficult SBDC (odds ratio 15.4, 95% confidence interval 4.2-56.0; p<0.001). Among patients who underwent CLAEUS prior to naïve ERCP, a strong correlation was observed between ""simultaneous depiction"" and the risk of difficult SBDC. An endoscopist can prepare for difficult SBDC by ""simultaneous depiction."" The finding enables pertinent planning when performing ERCP, such as setting time limits and selecting alternative devices, techniques, and skilled endoscopists, for difficult SBDC with minimal complications including post-ERCP pancreatitis. However, a future prospective study is necessary to establish the procedure algorithm for suspected difficult SBDC cases based on CLAEUS."
https://openalex.org/W3042106695,"Introduction Chronic hepatitis C (HCV), considered by the World Health Organization as one of the greatest epidemiological health hazards, often with asymptomatic clinical course and one which, due to scanty knowledge, remains a crucial risk factor of serious chronic HCV infection complications. The purpose of this study is to validate the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the validated Brief Hepatitis C Knowledge Scale (BHCKS_PL), developed by Balfour in 2009. Methods The study, conducted from May to July 2018, included 246 persons (68,69% females), divided into four subgroups: patients (n = 86), nursing students (n = 74), medical students (n = 28), healthcare workers (nurses and doctors; n = 58). The 19-items questionnaire contained questions designed to assess general knowledge regarding hepatitis C and the transmission risk factors. Results An evaluation by means of multiple comparisons in pairs showed that there were significant differences in the knowledge level between the group of patients and the group of nursing students (Mdn: 14.0 vs 11.0, z = 7.713, P<0.001), and between students of medicine (Mdn: 16.0 vs 11.0, z = 0.339, P<0.001) and healthcare workers (17.0 vs 11.0, z = 11.447, P<0.001). Moreover, significant differences were observed between the groups of students of nursing and medicine (Mdn: 14.0 vs 16.0, z = 3.646, P = 0.002) and healthcare workers (Mdn: 14.0 vs 17.0, z = 4.117, P<0.001). No significant differences in the knowledge level between the students of medicine and healthcare workers were observed (z = 0.377, P = 1.000). Conclusions The completed validation suggests good BHCKS_P psychometric characteristics with the internal consistency convergent and known-groups validity. The questionnaire can be used in educational practice. The obtained results of the measurement provide information about the studied person based on the total score."
https://openalex.org/W3041125101,"The beta blockers carvedilol, bisoprolol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate reduce readmissions and mortality among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), based upon clinical trial and registry studies. Results from these studies may not generalize to the typical patient with HFrEF. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of beneficiaries in the Medicare 5% sample hospitalized for HFrEF between 2007 and 2013 and were discharged alive. We compared the 30-day and 365-day heart failure (HF) readmission, all-cause readmission, and mortality rates between beneficiaries who filled a prescription for an evidence-based beta blocker and those who did not after being hospitalized for HFrEF. Out of 12,127 beneficiaries hospitalized for HFrEF, 20% were readmitted for HF, 62% were readmitted for any cause, and 27% died within 365 days. In competing risk models adjusted for demographics, healthcare utilization, and comorbidities, beta blocker use was associated with a lower risk of HF readmission between 8-365 days post discharge (hazard ratio 0.79 [95% confidence interval 0.76, 0.82]), but was not significantly associated with all-cause readmission (1.02 [0.97-1.07]). In Cox models adjusted for the same covariates, beta blocker use was associated with lower mortality 8-365 days post discharge (0.65 [0.60-0.71]). Results were similar when follow up was truncated at 30 days post discharge. Increasing the use of beta blockers following HFrEF hospitalization may not decrease all-cause readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries, but may reduce HF-specific readmissions and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3042037110,"It is widely believed that one's peers influence product adoption behaviors. This relationship has been linked to the number of signals a decision-maker receives in a social network. But it is unclear if these same principles hold when the pattern by which it receives these signals vary and when peer influence is directed towards choices which are not optimal. To investigate that, we manipulate social signal exposure in an online controlled experiment using a game with human participants. Each participant in the game makes a decision among choices with differing utilities. We observe the following: (1) even in the presence of monetary risks and previously acquired knowledge of the choices, decision-makers tend to deviate from the obvious optimal decision when their peers make similar decision which we call the influence decision, (2) when the quantity of social signals vary over time, the forwarding probability of the influence decision and therefore being responsive to social influence does not necessarily correlate proportionally to the absolute quantity of signals. To better understand how these rules of peer influence could be used in modeling applications of real world diffusion and in networked environments, we use our behavioral findings to simulate spreading dynamics in real world case studies. We specifically try to see how cumulative influence plays out in the presence of user uncertainty and measure its outcome on rumor diffusion, which we model as an example of sub-optimal choice diffusion. Together, our simulation results indicate that sequential peer effects from the influence decision overcomes individual uncertainty to guide faster rumor diffusion over time. However, when the rate of diffusion is slow in the beginning, user uncertainty can have a substantial role compared to peer influence in deciding the adoption trajectory of a piece of questionable information."
