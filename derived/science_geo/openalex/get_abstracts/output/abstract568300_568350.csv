https://openalex.org/W2510292900,"Materials with good flexibility and high conductivity that can provide electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding with minimal thickness are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily processed into films. Two-dimensional metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine metallic conductivity and hydrophilic surfaces. Here, we demonstrate the potential of several MXenes and their polymer composites for EMI shielding. A 45-micrometer-thick Ti 3 C 2 T x film exhibited EMI shielding effectiveness of 92 decibels (&gt;50 decibels for a 2.5-micrometer film), which is the highest among synthetic materials of comparable thickness produced to date. This performance originates from the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti 3 C 2 T x films (4600 Siemens per centimeter) and multiple internal reflections from Ti 3 C 2 T x flakes in free-standing films. The mechanical flexibility and easy coating capability offered by MXenes and their composites enable them to shield surfaces of any shape while providing high EMI shielding efficiency."

Since prehistoric times, humans have exploited the capacity of the common baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to convert sugars into ethanol and desirable flavor compounds to obtain foods and beverages with a prolonged shelf-life, enriched sensorial palate, improved digestibility, and an euphoriant effect due to the presence of ethanol (Michel et al., 1992Michel R.H.

Whereas the use of pure cultures started well after the pioneering work of Pasteur and Hansen in the 19th century, early brewers, winemakers, and bakers had already learned that inoculating unfermented foods with a small portion of fermented product resulted in fast and more predictable fermentations. This so-called “backslopping” might have resulted in yeast lineages that grew continuously in these man-made environments and lost contact with their natural niches, providing a perfect setting for domestication. However, strong evidence for this hypothesis is still missing and it remains unclear whether industrial yeast diversity is shaped by selection and niche adaptation (domestication) or neutral divergence caused by geographic isolation and limited dispersal (Goddard and Greig, 2015Goddard M.R.

Domestication is defined as human selection and breeding of wild species to obtain cultivated variants that thrive in man-made environments, but behave suboptimally in nature. Typical signs of domestication, including genome decay, polyploidy, chromosomal rearrangements, gene duplications, and phenotypes resulting from human-driven selection, have been reported in crops, livestock, and pets (Driscoll et al., 2009Driscoll C.A.

However, most of these studies focused primarily on yeasts from wild and clinical habitats and often include only a limited set of industrial strains, mainly originating from wine. Moreover, most studies use haploid derivatives instead of natural strains and can therefore not explore typical patterns of domestication like polyploidy, aneuploidy, and heterozygosity. The use of haploids also excludes a large fraction of industrial S. cerevisiae strains that have lost the ability to sporulate, such as the vast majority of beer yeasts. Nevertheless, some studies already revealed signs of domestication in wine strains, such as an increased resistance to copper (present in grapevine pesticides) and sulfite (used as a preservative in wine) (Pérez-Ortín et al., 2002Pérez-Ortín J.E.

Louis E.J. et al.Trait variation in yeast is defined by population history.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002111Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). An in-depth investigation of strains originating from other industrial niches is still lacking. Here, we describe the high-quality sequencing, de novo assembly, annotation, and extensive phenotyping of 157 S. cerevisiae strains used for the industrial production of beer, wine, bread, spirits, saké, and bioethanol, in their natural ploidy. Our data reveal that industrial yeasts are genetically and phenotypically distinct from wild strains and stem from only a limited set of ancestral strains that have been adapting to man-made environments. They further diversified into five clades: one including Asian strains such as saké yeasts, one mostly containing wine yeasts, a mixed clade that contains bread and other yeasts, and two separate families of beer yeasts. While most clades lack strong geographical substructure, one of the beer clades contains geographically isolated subgroups of strains used in continental Europe (Belgium/Germany), the United Kingdom, and a recent sublineage of United States beer yeasts that diverged from the British subclade during colonization. Interestingly, these beer yeast lineages exhibit clear and profound hallmarks of domestication, more so than the other lineages. The shift from variable, complex, and often harsh environments encountered in nature to more stable and nutrient-rich beer medium favored specialized adaptations in beer yeasts, but also led to genome decay, aneuploidy, and loss of a functional sexual cycle. Specifically, we find evidence for active human selection, demonstrated by convergent evolution for efficient fermentation of beer-specific carbon sources, mainly through mutations and duplications of the MAL (maltose) genes, as well as nonsense mutations in PAD1 and FDC1, which are involved in the production of 4-vinyl guaiacol (4-VG), an undesirable off-flavor in beer. Our results further suggest that beer yeast domestication was initiated hundreds of years ago, well after the first reported beer production, but before the discovery of microbes. Together, our results reveal how today’s industrial yeasts are the outcome of centuries of human domestication and provide a new resource for further selection and breeding of superior variants. To examine the evolutionary history of industrial yeasts, we sequenced the genomes of 157 S. cerevisiae isolates originating from various sources in their natural ploidy to a median coverage of 135× (min = 26×, max = 403×) (for details on data analysis, see STAR Methods). This collection includes 102 industrial beer strains, 19 wine strains, 11 spirit strains, 7 saké strains, 7 strains isolated from spontaneous fermentations, 5 bioethanol strains, 4 bread strains, and 2 laboratory strains (Table S1). Interestingly, ten of these S. cerevisiae beer strains are used for commercial production of lager beers, which were believed to be exclusively produced by strains of the genetically related Saccharomyces pastorianus. After de novo assembly of each of the genomes, we inferred a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on codon alignments for 2,020 concatenated single-copy nuclear genes shared by each of the 157 isolates and the outgroup species Saccharomyces paradoxus (Figure S1A). Additionally, we included a representative set of 24 previously sequenced strains belonging to the main established lineages of the S. cerevisiae phylogeny (Liti et al., 2009Liti G. Carter D.M. Moses A.M. Warringer J. Parts L. James S.A. Davey R.P. Roberts I.N. Burt A.

Trees constructed from the original and extended datasets are congruent and show five main lineages that contain the majority of industrial yeasts: Wine (bootstrap support 100%), Beer 1 (86%), Beer 2 (56%), Asia (100%), and a Mixed lineage (99%) containing yeasts used in different industries. Three of these lineages (Beer 1, Beer 2, and Mixed) were not previously described.Figure 1Phylogeny and Population Structure of Industrial S. cerevisiae StrainsShow full caption(A) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of all S. cerevisiae strains sequenced in this project supplemented with a representative set of 24 previously sequenced strains (Liti et al., 2009Liti G.

Colors represent different populations. WA, West Africa; NA, North America; M, Malaysia; NS, not specified. See also Figure S1 and Tables S1, S2, and S8. Next, we studied the population structure in a filtered set of 53,929 polymorphic sites accounting for 2,454,052 SNPs across all strains, using the Bayesian model-based clustering approach implemented in fastStructure (Raj et al., 2014Raj A. Stephens M. Pritchard J.K. fastSTRUCTURE: variational inference of population structure in large SNP data sets.Genetics. 2014; 197: 573-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B and S1B). This analysis yields a population structure that is highly consistent with the major lineages defined in the phylogeny and identifies mosaicism in 17% of the strains (in which the estimated ancestry Q < 0.8 for K = 8 ancestral populations). The population structure is further supported by a principal component analysis (PCA) on the same SNP data (Figure 1C). Further analysis of the phylogeny and population structure reveals that the evolutionary divergence of industrial yeasts is shaped by both their industrial application and geographical origin. First, most yeasts cluster together according to the industry in which they are used and are clearly separated from the wild or clinical yeasts that have previously been sequenced. This was further confirmed by constructing a larger phylogeny, based on nine genomic regions, that includes the vast majority of all sequenced S. cerevisiae strains, 450 isolates in total (Figure S1C; Table S2). Wine and saké yeasts cluster in the previously identified Wine and Asia lineages (Liti et al., 2009Liti G. Carter D.M. Moses A.M. Warringer J. Parts L. James S.A. Davey R.P. Roberts I.N. Burt A. Koufopanou V. et al.Population genomics of domestic and wild yeasts.Nature. 2009; 458: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The majority of beer yeasts (85.3%) are found in two main lineages (Beer 1 and Beer 2) that are only distantly related. The Mixed clade harbors 7.8% of all beer strains (most of which are atypical beer yeasts that are used for bottle refermentation of strong Belgian ales) and contains all bread strains. Interestingly, spirit strains lack this clear phylogenetic relationship, as they are highly mosaic and scattered throughout the tree, suggesting that these strains might be the result of breeding by modern-day yeast companies that sell yeasts for spirits production. Moreover, because spirit yeasts are typically not re-used after fermentation, they likely had less opportunity to diverge into a separate clade. Within and between the lineages, we also observed geographical patterns. For example, most saké yeasts form a monophyletic group and cluster together with wild isolates and bioethanol strains from China, while South American bioethanol strains are closely related to strains used to produce cachaça, a Brazilian sugarcane spirit. Moreover, the Beer 1 clade consists of three separate subpopulations, each reflecting geographically distinct groups: Belgium/Germany, Britain, and the United States. The absence of genetic admixture among these subpopulations indicates that these strains diverged allopatrically after the initial split (Figure 1B). Moreover, the high nucleotide diversity within each of the Beer 1 sublineages exceeds that within the Wine population, suggesting that the split did not happen recently (Table 1). Compared to Beer 1, Beer 2 is more closely related to the Wine lineage and includes 20.6% of all brewing strains. However, in contrast to the Beer 1 group, the Beer 2 lineage lacks geographic structure and contains yeasts originating from Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Eastern Europe. The presence of two major genetically distinct sources of beer yeasts hints toward two independent European domestication events, one of which is at the origin of both the Wine and Beer 2 clade.Table 1Genetic Diversity within Each Subpopulation of Industrial S. cerevisiae StrainsSubpopulationNumber of StrainsAnalyzed SitesSegregating SitesπΘwBritain2612,018,937101,8813.13E-031.88E-03United States1011,973,23972,5592.31E-031.72E-03Belgium/Germany1812,017,007108,5603.12E-032.19E-03Mixed1712,043,532132,1884.35E-032.69E-03Wine2412,052,956114,1331.59E-032.15E-03Beer 22112,063,361142,7452.95E-032.77E-03Asia1012,035,74599,8792.39E-032.36E-03The number of strains per subpopulation, the amount of analyzed and segregating sites, as well as nucleotide diversity (π) and population mutation rate (Watterson’s θ, θw) are indicated.

Sequencing the yeast strains in their natural ploidy allowed analysis of gross chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidies (Figure 2A). We detected a staggering 15,288 deletion and amplification events across all strains, covering on average 1.57 Mb per strain. The size of the regions ranges from complete chromosomes (resulting in aneuploidies) to small local variations of a few kilobases (kb), all of which we will refer to as “CNVs.” The extent of deletions significantly exceeds that of amplifications, respectively 1.07 Mb and 0.50 Mb on average per strain (2.15-fold difference, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001). We observed significant variation among strains originating from different industries in the total frequency of CNV events (ANOVA F test, p < 0.001) and the fraction of the genome affected (ANOVA F-test, p < 0.001) (Figure S2). Pairwise comparisons of subpopulations and industries show no significant differences in the load of amplifications between strains from different industries or subpopulations, but we detected significant differences in the load of deletions between strains from the wine (median = 0.51 Mb) and beer (median = 0.94 Mb) industry (Tukey honest significant difference [HSD], p < 0.05) (Figures 2B–2E). This high incidence of CNV in beer strains goes together with a high incidence of polyploidy and aneuploidy (R2 ∼0.14, p < 0.001; average genome content of 3.52, SD = 0.67, Figures 2A, 2F, and 2G), which is linked to extensive chromosomal loss and general genome instability (Sheltzer et al., 2011Sheltzer J.M.

The phylogenetic tree is described in Figure S1A. CNVs are not uniformly spread across the genome. Considering subtelomere lengths of 33 kb (Brown et al., 2010Brown C.A. Murray A.W. Verstrepen K.J. Rapid expansion and functional divergence of subtelomeric gene families in yeasts.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 895-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), on average 39.7% of subtelomeric nucleotide positions are affected by CNV events compared to 9.54% of non-subtelomeric nucleotide positions (4.1-fold difference, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.001). However, not all subtelomeres are equally prone to CNV: most variability is detected in ChrI, ChrVII, ChrVIII, ChrIX, ChrX, ChrXII, ChrXV, and ChrXVI (Figure 2A). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis reveals that genes involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism, ion transport, and flocculation are most heavily influenced by CNVs (Table S3), which is in line with previous results (Bergström et al., 2014Bergström A. Simpson J.T. Salinas F. Barré B. Parts L. Zia A. Nguyen Ba A.N. Moses A.M. Louis E.J. Mustonen V. et al.A high-definition view of functional genetic variation from natural yeast genomes.Mol. Biol.

Interestingly, some CNVs seem linked to specific environments (Table S4), suggesting that CNVs may underlie niche adaptation. For example, many genes involved in uptake and breakdown of maltose (present in saké medium, main carbon source in beer, but absent from grape must) are amplified in beer and saké-related subpopulations, while they are often lost in strains from the Wine subpopulation (false discovery rate [FDR] q value < 0.001). Apart from selection for industrial traits, domestication is also characterized by relaxed selection and potential loss of costly traits that are not beneficial in the man-made environment (Driscoll et al., 2009Driscoll C.A.

https://openalex.org/W2513054915,"The ability of cells to follow gradients of extracellular matrix stiffness—durotaxis—has been implicated in development, fibrosis, and cancer. Here, we found multicellular clusters that exhibited durotaxis even if isolated constituent cells did not. This emergent mode of directed collective cell migration applied to a variety of epithelial cell types, required the action of myosin motors, and originated from supracellular transmission of contractile physical forces. To explain the observed phenomenology, we developed a generalized clutch model in which local stick-slip dynamics of cell-matrix adhesions was integrated to the tissue level through cell-cell junctions. Collective durotaxis is far more efficient than single-cell durotaxis; it thus emerges as a robust mechanism to direct cell migration during development, wound healing, and collective cancer cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2513280988,"Tumor genetics guides patient selection for many new therapies, and cell culture studies have demonstrated that specific mutations can promote metabolic phenotypes. However, whether tissue context defines cancer dependence on specific metabolic pathways is unknown. Kras activation and Trp53 deletion in the pancreas or the lung result in pancreatic ductal adenocarinoma (PDAC) or non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), respectively, but despite the same initiating events, these tumors use branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) differently. NSCLC tumors incorporate free BCAAs into tissue protein and use BCAAs as a nitrogen source, whereas PDAC tumors have decreased BCAA uptake. These differences are reflected in expression levels of BCAA catabolic enzymes in both mice and humans. Loss of Bcat1 and Bcat2, the enzymes responsible for BCAA use, impairs NSCLC tumor formation, but these enzymes are not required for PDAC tumor formation, arguing that tissue of origin is an important determinant of how cancers satisfy their metabolic requirements."

Laboratory experiments, however, often study evolution in well-mixed systems. Here, we introduce an experimental device, the microbial evolution and growth arena (MEGA)–plate, in which bacteria spread and evolved on a large antibiotic landscape (120 × 60 centimeters) that allowed visual observation of mutation and selection in a migrating bacterial front. While resistance increased consistently, multiple coexisting lineages diversified both phenotypically and genotypically. Analyzing mutants at and behind the propagating front, we found that evolution is not always led by the most resistant mutants; highly resistant mutants may be trapped behind more sensitive lineages. The MEGA-plate provides a versatile platform for studying microbial adaption and directly visualizing evolutionary dynamics."

Although these so-called sickness behaviors are the most common and familiar symptoms of infections, their roles in host defense are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of anorexia in models of bacterial and viral infections. We found that anorexia was protective while nutritional supplementation was detrimental in bacterial sepsis. Furthermore, glucose was necessary and sufficient for these effects. In contrast, nutritional supplementation protected against mortality from influenza infection and viral sepsis, whereas blocking glucose utilization was lethal. In both bacterial and viral models, these effects were largely independent of pathogen load and magnitude of inflammation. Instead, we identify opposing metabolic requirements tied to cellular stress adaptations critical for tolerance of differential inflammatory states. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2515956381,"A vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 is likely to be protective, but this has not been achieved. To explore immunization regimens that might elicit bNAbs, we produced and immunized mice expressing the predicted germline PGT121, a bNAb specific for the V3-loop and surrounding glycans on the HIV-1 spike. Priming with an epitope-modified immunogen designed to activate germline antibody-expressing B cells, followed by ELISA-guided boosting with a sequence of directional immunogens, native-like trimers with decreasing epitope modification, elicited heterologous tier-2-neutralizing responses. In contrast, repeated immunization with the priming immunogen did not. Antibody cloning confirmed elicitation of high levels of somatic mutation and tier-2-neutralizing antibodies resembling the authentic human bNAb. Our data establish that sequential immunization with specifically designed immunogens can induce high levels of somatic mutation and shepherd antibody maturation to produce bNAbs from their inferred germline precursors."

The composition of the inhibitory postsynapse and the mechanistic basis of its regulation, however, remain poorly understood. We used an in vivo chemico-genetic proximity-labeling approach to discover inhibitory postsynaptic proteins. Quantitative mass spectrometry not only recapitulated known inhibitory postsynaptic proteins but also revealed a large network of new proteins, many of which are either implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders or are of unknown function. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) depletion of one of these previously uncharacterized proteins, InSyn1, led to decreased postsynaptic inhibitory sites, reduced the frequency of miniature inhibitory currents, and increased excitability in the hippocampus. Our findings uncover a rich and functionally diverse assemblage of previously unknown proteins that regulate postsynaptic inhibition and might contribute to developmental brain disorders."

VRC01-class bnAbs are important vaccine leads because their precursor B cells targeted by an engineered priming immunogen are relatively common among humans. This priming immunogen has demonstrated the ability to initiate a bnAb response in animal models, but recall and maturation toward bnAb development has not been shown. Here, we report the development of boosting immunogens designed to guide the genetic and functional maturation of previously primed VRC01-class precursors. Boosting a transgenic mouse model expressing germline VRC01 heavy chains produced broad neutralization of near-native isolates (N276A) and weak neutralization of fully native HIV. Functional and genetic characteristics indicate that the boosted mAbs are consistent with partially mature VRC01-class antibodies and place them on a maturation trajectory that leads toward mature VRC01-class bnAbs. The results show how reductionist sequential immunization can guide maturation of HIV bnAb responses."

Unitary connections were composed of one or two synaptic contacts, suggesting efficient use of postsynaptic space.

https://openalex.org/W2514256437,"The design of immunogens that elicit broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) has been a major obstacle to HIV-1 vaccine development. One approach to assess potential immunogens is to use mice expressing precursors of human bnAbs as vaccination models. The bnAbs of the VRC01-class derive from the IGHV1-2 immunoglobulin heavy chain and neutralize a wide spectrum of HIV-1 strains via targeting the CD4 binding site of the envelope glycoprotein gp120. We now describe a mouse vaccination model that allows a germline human IGHV1-2(∗)02 segment to undergo normal V(D)J recombination and, thereby, leads to the generation of peripheral B cells that express a highly diverse repertoire of VRC01-related receptors. When sequentially immunized with modified gp120 glycoproteins designed to engage VRC01 germline and intermediate antibodies, IGHV1-2(∗)02-rearranging mice, which also express a VRC01-antibody precursor light chain, can support the affinity maturation of VRC01 precursor antibodies into HIV-neutralizing antibody lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2511569778,"INTRODUCTION In DNA double helices, hydrogen bonds connect the base pairs across the two strands, and stacking bonds act along the helical axis between neighboring base pairs. Our understanding of DNA and the way it is processed in biology would profit from improved knowledge about the elementary bonds in DNA. Detailed knowledge of the time scales for breaking and forming individual base pairs and base-pair stacks would also help to make more informed decisions in the design of dynamic DNA-based nanoscale devices. RATIONALE The goal of this work is to measure the dynamics of DNA base-pair stacking at the level of individual base-pair steps. Because stacking interactions act perpendicularly to the hydrogen bonds, it should be possible to use mechanical forces to break stacking while leaving hydrogen bonds intact. To realize such measurements, we combine the positioning capabilities of DNA origami with single-molecule manipulation, as enabled by dual-beam optical traps. To make the weak single–base-pair stacking interactions experimentally accessible, we prepared parallel arrays of blunt-end DNA double helices to take advantage of avidity effects when these arrays form stacking interactions (see the figure). Our design allowed controlling the number and the sequences of the base-pair stacks. Noise-suppressing by stiff DNA origami beams connected by a flexible polymer tether enabled the repeated detection of unbinding and rebinding of stacking contacts at low forces (down to 2 piconewtons) with high time resolution (up to 1 kHz). RESULTS We sampled all 16 sequence combinations of installing a particular interfacial base pair on the array on the left beam and another base pair in the array on the right beam, and we created arrays with two, four, and six blunt ends. We could measure the force-dependent lifetimes for all base-pair step sequence combinations in the presence of 20 mM MgCl 2 , which is a condition typically used in DNA nanotechnology. For a subset of base-pair step combinations, we also obtained data in the presence of 500 mM NaCl, which mimics the conditions in the cell nucleus. The base-pair stack arrays spontaneously dissociated at average rates ranging from 0.02 to 500 per second, where the dissociation time scale strongly depended on the sequence combination and the stack array size. For a given sequence combination, larger array sizes always had larger lifetimes, as expected from avidity. Another key feature revealed in the lifetime data was the low sensitivity of the stacking interactions on the extent of pulling force. This phenomenon reflects short-ranged interaction potentials. Concerning rebinding of the stack arrays, we found that the rebinding kinetics depended much more strongly on the applied force, which may be understood by considering that rebinding of the stacks requires a thermally activated contraction of the flexible tether—which was the same for all variants—against an opposing force tether contraction. However, the rebinding kinetics was independent, within experimental error, of the base-pair step sequence combination and the size of the array under study. We used a model to estimate the free-energy increments per single base-pair stack from the kinetic rates that we measured with stack arrays. The free-energy increments per stack ranged from –0.8 to –3.4 kilocalories per mole. Our data reveals a trend in the stacking-strength hierarchy that may be associated with the extent of geometrical atomic overlap between the bases within a base-pair step. CONCLUSION Our data provides a quantitative basis for the rational design of dynamic DNA-based nanoscale machines and assemblies. Nanoengineers can directly read off the expected lifetimes of stack arrays for all sequence combinations and for various array sizes and at salt conditions that are commonly used in the field. With this data, design solutions for transition kinetics may be generated that cover several orders of magnitudes in lifetime, from milliseconds to several seconds. The sequence-resolved information obtained in our experiments may inform kinetic models of DNA hybridization and may help in adjusting force fields to perform more realistic molecular dynamics simulations. More generally, our experimental methods advance the capabilities of single-molecule mechanical experiments. Using the tethered-beam system, target molecules may be placed and exposed in controlled orientations and stoichiometry so as to study the weak forces occurring between them in solution. A variety of interactions between various kinds of molecules may be studied in the future due to the modularity and the addressability of the DNA origami–based tethered-beam system. How strong is DNA base-pair stacking? Schematic illustration of the experimental system that we developed to measure the strength of base-pair stacking on the level of single particles. The system consists of two tethered DNA origami beams that feature parallel arrays of blunt-end DNA double helices. The beams may be attached to two micrometer-sized beads for manipulation in a dual-beam optical trap. With this system, we could measure lifetimes at which DNA base-pair stacks spontaneously dissociate as a function of force applied in the helical direction."

https://openalex.org/W2512777378,"Defects in mitochondrial metabolism have been increasingly linked with age-onset protein-misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. In response to protein-folding stress, compartment-specific unfolded protein responses (UPRs) within the ER, mitochondria, and cytosol work in parallel to ensure cellular protein homeostasis. While perturbation of individual compartments can make other compartments more susceptible to protein stress, the cellular conditions that trigger cross-communication between the individual UPRs remain poorly understood. We have uncovered a conserved, robust mechanism linking mitochondrial protein homeostasis and the cytosolic folding environment through changes in lipid homeostasis. Metabolic restructuring caused by mitochondrial stress or small-molecule activators trigger changes in gene expression coordinated uniquely by both the mitochondrial and cytosolic UPRs, protecting the cell from disease-associated proteins. Our data suggest an intricate and unique system of communication between UPRs in response to metabolic changes that could unveil new targets for diseases of protein misfolding."

The mechanism by which the central nervous system elicits a distal reaction to proteotoxic stress remains unknown. We hypothesized that the endocrine communication of neuronal stress plays a causative role in the changes in mitochondrial homeostasis associated with proteotoxic disease states. We find that an aggregation-prone protein expressed in the neurons of C. elegans binds to mitochondria, eliciting a global induction of a mitochondrial-specific unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)), affecting whole-animal physiology. Importantly, dense core vesicle release and secretion of the neurotransmitter serotonin is required for the signal's propagation.

The conventional explanation is that the HSEs were stripped from the mantle by the segregation of metal during core formation but were added back in near-chondritic proportions by late accretion, after core formation had ceased. Here we show that metal-silicate equilibration and segregation during Earth’s core formation actually increased HSE mantle concentrations because HSE partition coefficients are relatively low at the high pressures of core formation within Earth. The pervasive exsolution and segregation of iron sulfide liquid from silicate liquid (the “Hadean matte”) stripped magma oceans of HSEs during cooling and crystallization, before late accretion, and resulted in slightly suprachondritic palladium/iridium and ruthenium/iridium ratios."

https://openalex.org/W2517776794,"Although small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is highly responsive to chemotherapies (e.g., cisplatin-etoposide doublet), virtually almost all responsive SCLC patients experience disease recurrence characterized by drug resistance. The mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance remain elusive. Here we report that cell-intrinsic expression of PD1 and PD-L1, two immune checkpoints, is required for sustained expansion of SCLC cells under cisplatin selection. Indeed, PD1 and PD-L1 were expressed at a higher level in lung cancer cell lines, tumor tissues, and importantly, in SCLC cells resistant to cisplatin (H69R, H82R), when compared to respective controls. Genetic abrogation of PD1 and PD-L1 in H69R and H82R cells decreased their proliferation rate, and restored their sensitivity to cisplatin. Mechanistically, PD-L1 upregulation in H69R and H82R cells was attributed to the overexpression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) or receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, as knockdown of DNMT1 or KIT in H69R and H82R cells led to PD-L1 downregulation. Consequently, combined knockdown of PD-L1 with KIT or DNMT1 resulted in more pronounced inhibition of H69R and H82R cell growth. Thus, cell intrinsic PD1/PD-L1 signaling may be a predictor for poor efficacy of cisplatin treatment, and targeting the cellular PD1/PD-L1 axis may improve chemosensitization of aggressive SCLC."

The observations indicate that near-to-intermediate-field dynamic triggering commonly exists and fundamentally promotes aftershock occurrence.

Exogenously supplied GLP-1 analogues are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. An anti-diabetic effect of Lactobacillus in lowering plasma glucose levels and its use as a vehicle for delivery of protein and antibody fragments has been shown previously. The aim of this study was to employ lactobacilli as a vehicle for in situ production and delivery of GLP-1 analogue to normalize blood glucose level in diabetic GK (Goto-Kakizaki) rats. In this study, we designed pentameric GLP-1 (5×GLP-1) analogues which were both expressed in a secreted form and anchored to the surface of lactobacilli. Intestinal trypsin sites were introduced within 5×GLP-1, leading to digestion of the pentamer into an active monomeric form. The E. coli-produced 5×GLP-1 peptides delivered by intestinal intubation to GK rats resulted in a significant improvement of glycemic control demonstrated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Meanwhile, the purified 5×GLP-1 (trypsin-digested) from the Lactobacillus cultures stimulated insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells, similar to the E. coli-produced 5×GLP-1 peptides. When delivered by gavage to GK rats, non-expressor L. paracasei significantly lowered the blood glucose level but 5×GLP-1 expression did not provide an additional anti-diabetic effect, possibly due to the low levels produced. Our results indicate that lactobacilli themselves might be used as an alternative treatment method for type 2 diabetes, but further work is needed to increase the expression level of GLP-1 by lactobacilli in order to obtain a significant insulinotropic effect in vivo."

Animals were subjected to a feed transition at d 16 post-weaning, and to 2-choice feeding tests at d 16 and d 23. Production traits of the piglets were assessed up to d 28 post-weaning. From d 26 onwards, animals underwent 2 brain imaging sessions (positron emission tomography of 18FDG) under anesthesia to investigate the brain activity triggered by the exposure to the flavors of the feed with (FA) or without (C) the FA. Images were analyzed with SPM8 and a region of interest (ROI)-based small volume correction (p < 0.05, k ≥ 25 voxels per cluster). The brain ROI were selected upon their role in sensory evaluation, cognition and reward, and included the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, fusiform gyrus, limbic system and corpus striatum. The FAM animals showed a moderate preference for the novel post-transition FA feed compared to the C feed on d 16, i.e., day of the feed transition (67% of total feed intake). The presence or absence of the FA in the diet from weaning had no impact on body weight, average daily gain, and feed efficiency of the animals over the whole experimental period (p ≥ 0.10). Familiar feed flavors activated the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala, insular cortex, and prepyriform area were only activated in familiarized animals exposed to the FA feed flavor. The perception of FA feed flavor in the familiarized animals activated the dorsal striatum differently than the perception of the C feed flavor in naive animals. Our data demonstrated that the perception of FA in familiarized individuals induced different brain responses in regions involved in reward anticipation and/or perception processes than the familiar control feed flavor in naive animals. Chronic exposure to the FA might be necessary for positive hedonic effects, but familiarity only cannot explain them."
https://openalex.org/W2514263385,"Due to altered biogeochemical processes related to climate change, highly colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial sources will lead to a water ""brownification"" in many freshwater systems of the Northern Hemisphere. This will create deteriorated visual conditions that have been found to affect habitat-specific morphological variations in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in a previous study. So far, potential drivers and ultimate causes of these findings have not been identified. We conducted a field study to investigate the connection between morphological divergence and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of perch from six lakes across a gradient of DOC concentration. We expected a decrease in the prevalence of PUFAs, which are important for perch growth and divergence with increasing DOC concentrations, due to the restructuring effects of DOC on aquatic food webs. In general, rate of morphological divergence in perch decreased with increasing DOC concentrations. Proportions of specific PUFAs (22:6n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3, and 20:4n-6) identified to primarily contribute to overall differences between perch caught in clear and brown-water lakes tended to be connected to overall decline of morphological divergence. However, no overall significant relationship was found, indicating no severe limitation of essential fatty acids for perch inhabiting brown water lakes. We further broaden our approach by conducting a laboratory experiment on foraging efficiency of perch. Therefore, we induced pelagic and littoral phenotypes by differences in habitat-structure and feeding mode and recorded attack rate in a feeding experiment. Generally, fish were less efficient in foraging on littoral prey (Ephemeroptera) when visual conditions were degraded by brown water color. We concluded that browning water may have a strong effect on the forager's ability to find particular food resources, resulting in the reduced development of evolutionary traits, such as habitat- specific morphological divergence."

Recovery may also be dependent on an enriched environment and physical activity. G-CSF may have the potential to enhance recovery when used in combination with physiotherapy, in patients with disability late after stroke. Methods A pilot 2 x 2 factorial randomised (1:1) placebo-controlled trial of G-CSF (double-blind), and/or a 6 week course of physiotherapy, in 60 participants with disability (mRS >1), at least 3 months after stroke. Primary outcome was feasibility, acceptability and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included death, dependency, motor function and quality of life measured 90 and 365 days after enrolment. Results Recruitment to the trial was feasible and acceptable; of 118 screened patients, 92 were eligible and 32 declined to participate. 60 patients were recruited between November 2011 and July 2013. All participants received some allocated treatment. Although 29 out of 30 participants received all 5 G-CSF/placebo injections, only 7 of 30 participants received all 18 therapy sessions. G-CSF was well tolerated but associated with a tendency to more adverse events than placebo (16 vs 10 patients, p = 0.12) and serious adverse events (SAE) (9 vs 3, p = 0.10). On average, patients received 14 (out of 18 planned) therapy sessions, interquartile range [12, 17]. Only a minority (23%) of participants completed all physiotherapy sessions, a large proportion of sessions (114 of 540, 21%) were cancelled due to patient (94, 17%) and therapist factors (20, 4%). No significant differences in functional outcomes were detected in either the G-CSF or physiotherapy group at day 90 or 365. Conclusions Delivery of G-CSF is feasible in chronic stroke. However, the study failed to demonstrate feasibility for delivering additional physiotherapy sessions late after stroke therefore a definitive study using this trial design is not supported. Future work should occur earlier after stroke, alongside on-going clinical rehabilitation. Trial Registration ISRCTN.com ISRCTN16714730"
https://openalex.org/W2516616180,"Two of the most common myeloid malignancies, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), are associated with exceedingly low survival rates despite recent therapeutic advances. While their etiology is not completely understood, evidence suggests that certain chromosomal abnormalities contribute to MDS and AML progression. Among the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in these disorders are alterations of chromosome 7: either complete loss of one copy of chromosome 7 (-7) or partial deletion of 7q (del(7q)), both of which increase the risk of progression from MDS to AML and are associated with chemoresistance. Notably, 7q36.1, a critical minimally deleted region in 7q, includes the gene encoding the histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), which is also mutated in a small percentage of AML patients. However, the mechanisms by which MLL3 loss contributes to malignancy are unknown. Using an engineered mouse model expressing a catalytically inactive form of Mll3, we found a significant shift in hematopoiesis toward the granulocyte/macrophage lineage, correlating with myeloid infiltration and enlargement of secondary lymphoid organs.

Cell migration was measured by a wound healing assay. An ELISA assay was used to evaluate paracrine functions. SOD and MDA were tested by xanthine oxidase and thiobarbituric acid reactions, respectively. In addition, we used a CCK-8, LDH assay and flow cytometry to analyze the proliferation and apoptosis of ADSCs treated with lidocaine or adrenaline.The viable ADSCs yield from liposuction was significantly lower than that from lipectomy, while the apoptosis of cells from liposuction was significantly higher than from lipectomy. The paracrine secretion of the two sources of ADSCs was highest when treated with 10-7 mol/L insulin and 10 ng/mL TGF-α, but there were no significant differences in VEGF, IL-6, IL-8 or HGF levels. The ADSCs from lipectomy migrated faster than those from liposuction, and SOD in the lipectomy group was higher than in the liposuction group, whereas MDA of the lipectomy group was lower than that of the liposuction group. The proliferation ADSCs treated with lidocaine or adrenaline was greatly decreased, while apoptosis was significantly increased, and cytotoxicity of lidocaine or adrenaline to ADSCs was dose-dependent.Compared with ADSCs from liposuction, the ADSCs from lipectomy have better biological characteristics. Lidocaine and adrenaline decreased the viability of ADSCs, and their cytotoxicity to ADSCs was dose-dependent."

To further validate the genetic effect and potential molecular mechanisms of SAA1 gene involved in regulating milk production traits in dairy cattle, we herein performed a study through genotype-phenotype associations. Six identified SNPs were significantly associated with one or more milk production traits (0.00002< P < 0.0025), providing additional evidence for the potential role of SAA1 variants in milk production traits in dairy cows. Subsequently, both luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) clearly demonstrated that the allele A of g.-963C>A increased the promoter activity by binding the PARP factor while allele C did not. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the secondary structure of SAA protein changed by the substitution A/G in the locus c. +2510A>G. Our findings were the first to reveal the significant associations of the SAA1 gene with milk production traits, providing basis for further biological function validation, and two identified SNPs, g.-963C>A and c. +2510A>G, may be considered as genetic markers for breeding in dairy cattle."

In spinal cord, regulation of the threshold of synaptic plasticity may determine the proneness to undergo sensitization and hyperresponsiveness to noxious input. In the current study, we increased endogenous dopamine levels in the dorsal horn by using re-uptake inhibitor GBR 12935. During the so-induced hyperdopaminergic transmission, conditioning low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation (LFS) to the sciatic nerve induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of C-fiber-evoked potentials in dorsal horn neurons. The magnitude of LTP was attenuated by blockade of either dopamine D1-like receptors (D1LRs) by with SCH 23390 or NMDA receptor subunit NR2B with antagonist Ro25-6981. Conditioning LFS during GBR 12935 administration increased phosphorylation of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr 32kDa (DARPP-32) at threonine 34 residue in synaptosomal (P3) fraction of dorsal horn homogenates, as assessed by Western blot analysis, which was partially prevented by NR2B blockade prior to conditioning stimulation. Conditioning LFS also was followed by higher co-localization of phosphorylated form of NR2B at tyrosine 1472 and pDARPP-32Thr34- with postsynaptic marker PSD-95 in transverse L5 dorsal horn sections. Such increase could be significantly attenuated by D1LR blockade with SCH 23390. The current results support that coincidental endogenous recruitment of D1LRs and NR2B in dorsal horn synapses plays a role in regulating afferent-induced nociceptive plasticity. Parallel increases in DARPP-32 phosphorylation upon LTP induction suggests a role for this phosphoprotein as intracellular detector of convergent D1L- and NMDA receptor activation."

We find that CaMKIINα, a natural inhibitor that binds to the T-site of CaMKII, also causes inhibition of dephosphorylation of CaMKII similar to GluN2B. Two residues on α-CaMKII, Glu96 and His282, are involved in the inhibition of CaMKII dephosphorylation exerted by binding of GluN2B. E96A-α-CaMKII is known to be defective in GluN2B-induced catalytic modulation.

On the 40th anniversary of the publication of Richard Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene, we explore the origins of cynical, strategic thinking in evolutionary biology, investigate how this illuminated the sexual and social lives of animals, and assess Dawkins’s suggestion that evolution is best understood by taking the gene’s-eye view. Richard Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene (Dawkins, 1976Dawkins R. The selfish gene. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1976Google Scholar), now entering its fifth decade, was unequivocally the most important popular book on evolutionary biology of the 20th century. It describes a revolutionary approach to animal behavior that was storming the academic community, wiping out the conceptually bankrupt “group selectionist” thinking that had come to dominate much of biology and opening up new vistas for exciting scientific enquiry. Unlike many works of popular science that give the impression of providing the last word on a topic, Dawkins’s book reads as an entry point into a much larger discussion and encourages the reader to join the conversation. This reader did exactly that: I can point to Dawkins's book as the reason why I chose to study and pursue a career in evolutionary biology. And, as numerous conversations with school pupils, undergraduates, and PhD students have shown me, it continues to pull in new recruits to this day. Here, I will consider three aspects of this landmark publication. First, I will explore the prehistory and context of the “strategic revolution” that provides the substantive core of Dawkins’s book. This fastens attention on the idea of biological entities as agents employing strategies in the pursuit of conflicting agendas and emphasizes that one needs to be clear as to which entities manifest agency and what they are striving to achieve. Second, I will discuss how this revolution was changing the way we think about animal behavior, providing simple explanations for general patterns observed in the natural world and unveiling hitherto unappreciated battlegrounds and suites of fascinating adaptations. Third, I will assess Dawkins’s particular suggestion that we must focus on the interests of the gene if we are to understand animal behavior, and I will investigate the relationship between selfish-gene theory and intragenomic conflicts of interest. The core feature of life is its apparent purposefulness. Prior to Charles Darwin, this had been attributed to the work of deities, but the theory of natural selection made clear how the appearance of design could instead emerge automatically as a consequence of heritable traits having differential impact upon their bearers’ reproductive success. Strangely, in the first half of the 20th century, this central and far-reaching scientific discovery was almost completely neglected by population geneticists, who treated natural selection as just another evolutionary force without any special importance. As a result, there was little formal clarity on issues of adaptive evolution and the question of which biological entity was supposed to manifest design and for what purpose. A key exception was R.A. Fisher, whose masterpiece The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (Fisher, 1999Fisher R.A. The genetical theory of natural selection: a complete variorum edition. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar) emphasized that it is individual organisms who become adapted, as shown by his “fundamental theorem of natural selection.” In the 1958 edition of his book, Fisher included a section on “the benefit of species,” emphasizing that any benefit of adaptation to the species as a whole is purely incidental. But the general assumption among population geneticists was that better allelic variants make for better bodies that make for better populations. They supposed that the question as to what “better” should mean may be of philosophical interest but of little consequence for science. However, purpose is inescapable in biology, and many of its subdisciplines are motivated and organized according to the idea that there is a functional, adaptive rationale underpinning biological structures. Consequently, the vacuum created by the population geneticists led to the insidious establishment of a pseudoscientific “group selectionism” that explained away all biological traits as functioning for the good of the species. Thus, reproduction and parental care were interpreted as being for the continuation of the species, as was the industry of sterile workers in social-insect societies and the gentlemanly antler-locking rituals of stags deciding access to does. By giving the impression of providing an explanatory framework that readily accommodated such phenomena without further investigative work needing to be undertaken, group selectionism opposed the advancement of the biological sciences. This state of affairs culminated in the 1962 publication of Vero Wynne-Edwards’s book Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behavior (Wynne-Edwards, 1962Wynne-Edwards V.C. Animal dispersion in relation to social behaviour. Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh, UK1962Google Scholar). Wynne-Edwards documented various fecundity-modulating behaviors across the animal kingdom, with a particular focus on bird populations, which he interpreted as group-level adaptations for regulating population density. He regarded the individual as exercising reproductive self-restraint so as to avoid overstretching resources and hence ensure continued population survival. The explicitness with which Wynne-Edwards framed his account within the group-selectionist mode of thinking provided a foil against which George Williams was able to launch an attack against this pseudoscientific paradigm, with his 1966 book Adaptation and Natural Selection (Williams, 1966Williams G.C. Adaptation and Natural Selection. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1966Google Scholar). Dawkins relates Williams’s key argument as to why group selectionism doesn’t add up: no matter how much individual selflessness would promote the health of the population, if selfish individuals enjoy greater reproductive success, then they will be favored by natural selection, such that adaptations are not expected to promote the fitness of the population but must instead be explained in terms of individual advantage. As highlighted by the title of his book, Dawkins descends lower in the biological hierarchy to locate adaptive agency at the level of the gene. He conceptualizes individual organisms as “gene machines,” built by the genes to transmit copies of themselves to future generations. However, he makes clear that this view of adaptation is philosophically rather than scientifically motivated and suggests that, whether we view the gene or the individual as the strategic agent, we will always derive the same empirical predictions. I’ll return to this issue later in this essay but for now will focus on how evolutionary biology was transformed by thinking carefully about the individual’s—or gene machine’s—advantage. The strategic, individualistic view of evolution provided greater illumination of a wide range of adaptive phenomena that were previously inexplicable from a group-selectionist perspective, immediately suggesting simple and direct explanations for many patterns observed in the natural world. Moreover, with the new understanding that appeals to the good of the group are untenable, there was a job to be done to explain apparently selfless behaviors that appeared to conflict with the Darwinian view of survival of the fittest. Dawkins’s account of this revolutionary work is framed in his language of gene machines, but he makes clear that the researchers in question would not use or even agree with this language, preferring to think of the individual as a free agent in her own right. One topic particularly revolutionized by the strategic view was the evolution of the sexes. Much of this understanding had been anticipated by Darwin, but these ideas were now given extra precision and predictive power. Geoff Parker and colleagues (Parker et al., 1972Parker G.A. Baker R.R. Smith V.G.F. J. Theor. Biol. 1972; 36: 529-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) developed mathematical models showing how, in “isogamous” populations in which all sex cells are initially of the same size, selection will simultaneously favor small, motile sex cells that selfishly exploit the resources carried by their mating partners and large, resource-laden sex cells that compensate for this exploitation, giving rise to the evolution of male versus female reproductive tactics. The very origin of the sexes was now explicable within this paradigm of cynical and selfish strategizing. From this basic asymmetry in resource investment would spring many other sex differences. Robert Trivers (Trivers, 1972Trivers R.L. Parental investment and sexual selection.in: Campbell B. Sexual selection and the descent of man. Aldine, Chicago, IL1972: 136-179Google Scholar) showed how the greater investment of resources made by females should render them less willing to abandon a current offspring in order to pursue future reproductive success and hence leave them more likely to be deserted by their mates and left holding the baby. This explained the scarcity of paternal care in the natural world. Moreover, intense sexual selection experienced by males to secure as many mating partners as possible explained extravagant and costly ornaments such as the peacock’s tail. Here, Dawkins discusses Fisher’s (Fisher, 1999Fisher R.A. The genetical theory of natural selection: a complete variorum edition. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar) suggestion that these are the products of a runaway process whereby, so long as an ornament is preferred by females in general, all females are favored to mate with ornamented males in order that their sons be similarly ornamented, even if it is unconducive to their survival, so that they may attract mating partners. And he contrasts this with Amotz Zahavi’s (Zahavi, 1975Zahavi A. J. Theor. Biol. 1975; 53: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (3513) Google Scholar) view that the ornament instead functions as a signal of male quality precisely because it is so burdensome. Either way, such cumbersome ornaments highlight that selection is not simply concerned with the individual’s survival but also their reproductive success and that wasteful extravagance may prevail so long as it gives a selfish, competitive advantage. A further refinement of the notion of fitness would make clear that this is distinct from fecundity and that individuals who produce more offspring may actually have fewer descendants in the long run if this leaves them with fewer resources to invest into parental care. Here, Dawkins celebrates the work of David Lack (Lack, 1954Lack D. The natural regulation of animal numbers. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK1954Google Scholar), whose studies of clutch size in wild birds showed that, indeed, rather than more eggs always translating into more surviving chicks, there is instead an optimal number of eggs that maximizes the number of offspring surviving to adulthood. Lack also showed that, under resource scarcity, the optimal clutch size may be rather smaller than under plenitude. Accordingly, individuals may be favored to voluntarily curb their fecundity in times of dearth. Here was an explanation for the self-restraint described by Wynne-Edwards, framed entirely in terms of strategic, individual advantage. But could the strategic view of individual advantage explain cooperation? Dawkins discusses the work of Trivers, John Maynard Smith, and George Price, showing that cooperative behavior can be favored when individuals react against each other. Trivers (Trivers, 1971Trivers R.L. Q. Rev. Biol. 1971; 46: 35-57Crossref Google Scholar) developed the theory of reciprocity (or “if you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours”) to show how a cooperative act may be costly in the short term but may nevertheless improve the individual’s lifetime reproductive success if it elicits extra cooperation from her social partners. Maynard Smith and Price (Maynard Smith and Price, 1973Maynard Smith J. Price G.R. Nature. 1973; 246: 15-18Crossref Scopus (3903) Google Scholar), developing the economic “theory of games” for application to behavioral ecology, showed that frequency-dependent selection could maintain cooperation, even if cheats enjoy a fitness advantage when rare, and emphasized “retaliator” strategies whereby otherwise cooperative individuals meet aggression with aggression in a manner reminiscent of Trivers’s reciprocators. This reveals that cooperation can indeed result from strategic self-interest. What about altruism, whereby a behavior actually reduces the actor’s lifetime reproductive success? Dawkins shows that this, too, can be framed in terms of individual self-interest, provided that we rethink what it is the individual wants. Hamilton’s (Hamilton, 1964Hamilton W.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1964; 7: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar) theory of “inclusive fitness” is based on the idea that an individual may transmit her heritable traits to future generations not only through personal reproduction, but also by promoting the reproductive success of her relatives, with whom she shares heritable traits in common. This insight revealed that altruistic behavior that reduces the actor’s direct fitness may be favored by natural selection so long as it provides a sufficiently large benefit to individuals who are sufficiently related to the altruist. This is altruism, though of a cynical, nepotistic flavor. Hamilton’s theory provides no basis for thinking organisms will ever behave for the good of the species as a whole. The precision of strategic agenda becomes particularly important in the context of interaction between relatives, where there is scope for nepotistic altruism but also the possibility of conflict. Trivers (Trivers, 1974Trivers R.L. Am. Zool. 1974; 14: 249-264Crossref Scopus (2602) Google Scholar) investigated a particularly striking instance of such tension, between parent and offspring whom, despite sharing half of their heritable constitution in common, may nevertheless be embroiled in extreme conflicts of interests. For instance, a mother may have some optimal amount of her reproductive resources that she will want to invest into her son, holding back the remainder for her future reproduction. But her son values his own future reproductive success more than he does his mother’s and, accordingly, is favored to extract more investment from her. Dawkins discusses manipulative begging and other postnatal behaviors, but such parent-offspring conflict may occur even before birth, with the fetus engaging in physiological warfare to drain his mother’s blood stream of nutrients for his own use. The hardships of pregnancy and the battle of wills that is the daily reality of parents of young children are placed in a new, evolutionary light. This revolutionary science was framed by these researchers in terms of individual advantage. However, Williams and Hamilton did also toy with the idea of seeing the gene, rather than the individual, as the strategic agent. In 1972, Hamilton (Hamilton, 1972Hamilton W.D. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1972; 3: 193-232Crossref Google Scholar) took a short diversion from an account of inclusive fitness to imagine an intelligent gene deliberating as to which alternative behaviors of its carrier would lead to more of its copies being transmitted to future generations. Dawkins elaborates this idea so that it comes to underpin his entire book, with the strategic revolution being couched in explicitly gene-centric language. But why does he do this, and is the approach successful? Dawkins gives two main reasons for identifying the gene as the strategic agent. First is the idea that, although the individual has only a fleeting existence over timescales appropriate to evolutionary change, the gene is potentially immortal. Second, he regards as axiomatic the idea that natural selection inevitably favors selfishness, such that altruistic behavior of individuals must be considered illusory and driven instead by more fundamental, selfish agendas. I find neither of these arguments particularly persuasive. With respect to timescales, the central feature of Darwin’s theory is that it explains adaptive design, and this adaptive design is manifested in the here and now and is packaged into units that we recognize as individual organisms. It is the individual organism that we actually see striving to maximize inclusive fitness, so it seems natural to seek adaptive explanations from this perspective. And with respect to the axiom of selfishness, I cannot see why selfishness should take conceptual precedence over altruism. Ironically, Dawkins’s argument is analogous to that of the group selectionists whom he was railing against. While they sought to explain individual-level altruism by appealing to group-level selfishness, he seeks to explain it by appealing to gene-level selfishness. More generally, the altruistic individual and the selfish gene are metaphors that can only be judged according to their empirical usefulness, and if, as Dawkins suggests, they always yield the very same testable predictions, then neither can be regarded as being “more correct.” I also find Dawkins’s discussion of selfish genes somewhat inconsistent and often vague. When most focused on the biology, he speaks of genes as if they are physical scraps of DNA residing in the bodies of living organisms. But when being more philosophical, he emphasizes that this is not what he means and that the gene is instead a distributed agent that simultaneously encompasses all identical copies in the population. That is, the hero of Dawkins’s book is actually the selfish allele. The allele’s-eye view is necessary in order for Dawkins to maintain his focus on selfishness: whereas the physical scrap of DNA—like a miniature organism—is favored to maximize its inclusive fitness (Gardner and Welch, 2011Gardner A. Welch J.J. J. Evol. Biol. 2011; 24: 1801-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), for example, by providing altruistic aid to other scraps of DNA with whom it has some probability of sharing identity by descent, the allele is locked in a zero-sum game of gene-pool frequencies that ensures success is synonymous with selfishness. But I don’t think this is the most useful way of thinking about evolution, and indeed, I believe it has actually obscured some interesting biology. In particular, the big disappointment of The Selfish Gene is that Dawkins doesn’t use this concept to explore intragenomic conflict. The genome is a battlefield of conflicting interests that simply cannot be understood in terms of individual advantage and must be interpreted from the gene’s-eye view (Burt and Trivers, 2006Burt A. Trivers R. Genes in conflict: the biology of selfish genetic elements. Belknap Press, Cambridge, MA2006Crossref Google Scholar). Dawkins would have been aware of several examples of such intragenomic conflict, including meiotic drivers and sex-ratio-distorting sex chromosomes, and many more have subsequently come to light following his book’s publication. I find it strange that such phenomena are overlooked in a book that is ostensibly about selfish genes. (Some measures are taken to address this in later editions.) In several places in his book, Dawkins comes tantalizingly close to identifying situations in which intragenomic conflicts may arise, but he does not truly embrace the gene’s-eye view and instead continues with standard, individual-level “gene machine” thinking. For instance, in explicating the (now largely discredited) “haplodiploidy hypothesis” for insect eusociality, he points out that female hymenopterans are more related to their full sisters via their paternal-origin genes than via their maternal-origin genes, on account of their father having only one haploid genome to pass on to his daughters. Explicit consideration of the gene’s interests would therefore suggest that, if a female’s genes had information regarding their parent of origin, her paternal-origin genes would place more value upon her sisters and would be more inclined to have the female enact altruism toward them, whereas her maternal-origin genes would place a lower relatedness valuation upon her sisters and would be less inclined to altruism. Such intralocus parent-of-origin conflict is the basis for David Haig’s “kinship theory of genomic imprinting” (Haig, 2002Haig D. Genomic imprinting and kinship. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, NJ2002Google Scholar), which may explain why some genes are consistently silenced when inherited from one parent but not the other. Had Dawkins really had his eye on the gene’s interests, he might have anticipated this exciting development in the theory of inclusive fitness—and the explosion of interest in intragenomic conflicts more generally. Was this simply a lack of imagination on his part? No. I think Dawkins’s focus on the selfish allele may have been a barrier to him noticing this potential conflict. While physical scraps of DNA of maternal origin may come into conflict with physical scraps of DNA of paternal origin, owing to differences in relatedness, it is difficult to frame such conflict in terms of the divergent interests of competing alleles, as the allele does not have a parent of origin. Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene has captured the imagination of generations of budding evolutionary biologists, as well as the general public. Even if some details do not seem to stand up to scrutiny, its overall message remains both insightful and timeless. Its enduring appeal lies in the way that it overturns folk wisdom on the harmony of nature, exposing the cynical tensions, all-out warfare, and occasional glimmers of true altruism in the sexual and social lives of animals in a way that is both shocking and yet also profoundly resonant with everyday human experience."
