https://openalex.org/W1526432046,"Carbon nanotubes combine a range of properties that make them well suited for use as probe tips in applications such as atomic force microscopy (AFM)1,2,3. Their high aspect ratio, for example, opens up the possibility of probing the deep crevices4 that occur in microelectronic circuits, and the small effective radius of nanotube tips significantly improves the lateral resolution beyond what can be achieved using commercial silicon tips5. Another characteristic feature of nanotubes is their ability to buckle elastically4,6, which makes them very robust while limiting the maximum force that is applied to delicate organic and biological samples. Earlier investigations into the performance of nanotubes as scanning probe microscopy tips have focused on topographical imaging, but a potentially more significant issue is the question of whether nanotubes can be modified to create probes that can sense and manipulate matter at the molecular level7. Here we demonstrate that nanotube tips with the capability of chemical and biological discrimination can be created with acidic functionality and by coupling basic or hydrophobic functionalities or biomolecular probes to the carboxyl groups that are present at the open tip ends. We have used these modified nanotubes as AFM tips to titrate the acid and base groups, to image patterned samples based on molecular interactions, and to measure the binding force between single protein–ligand pairs. As carboxyl groups are readily derivatized by a variety of reactions8, the preparation of a wide range of functionalized nanotube tips should be possible, thus creating molecular probes with potential applications in many areas of chemistry and biology."

https://openalex.org/W2087208805,"Recombinant DNA methods were used to create artificial proteins that undergo reversible gelation in response to changes in pH or temperature. The proteins consist of terminal leucine zipper domains flanking a central, flexible, water-soluble polyelectrolyte segment. Formation of coiled-coil aggregates of the terminal domains in near-neutral aqueous solutions triggers formation of a three-dimensional polymer network, with the polyelectrolyte segment retaining solvent and preventing precipitation of the chain. Dissociation of the coiled-coil aggregates through elevation of pH or temperature causes dissolution of the gel and a return to the viscous behavior that is characteristic of polymer solutions. The mild conditions under which gel formation can be controlled (near-neutral pH and near-ambient temperature) suggest that these materials have potential in bioengineering applications requiring encapsulation or controlled release of molecular and cellular species."
https://openalex.org/W2100641815,"The complete genome sequence of Treponema pallidum was determined and shown to be 1,138,006 base pairs containing 1041 predicted coding sequences (open reading frames). Systems for DNA replication, transcription, translation, and repair are intact, but catabolic and biosynthetic activities are minimized. The number of identifiable transporters is small, and no phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase carbohydrate transporters were found. Potential virulence factors include a family of 12 potential membrane proteins and several putative hemolysins. Comparison of the T. pallidum genome sequence with that of another pathogenic spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, identified unique and common genes and substantiates the considerable diversity observed among pathogenic spirochetes."

https://openalex.org/W1984776459,"Concentration changes of nitric oxide (NO) were monitored using an NO-sensitive electrode in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with either free oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) or red blood cells (RBCs). In aerated PBS, the half-life of 0.9 μm NO is greater than 4 min. NO is undetectable (<50 nm) when added to a solution of oxyHb because the reaction of NO with oxyHb is rapid. The disappearance rate of NO in PBS containing RBCs is rapid, compared with PBS, but it is much slower (by a factor of approximately 650) than with an equivalent solution of free oxyHb. The half-life of NO is inversely proportional to the concentration of RBCs, independent of oxyHb concentration inside RBCs, and the disappearance rate of NO is first order in NO concentration and first order in the concentration of RBCs. After all the oxyHb reacts with NO to form methemoglobin, the disappearance rate of NO slows greatly. These data indicate that the reaction of NO with oxyhemoglobin within RBCs is limited by the diffusion of NO into the cell, which has also been shown previously for the reaction of O<sub>2</sub> with deoxyhemoglobin. Experimental data show that the half-life of NO in the presence of 2.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> RBCs/ml is 4.2 s. From this value, we estimate that the half-life of NO in whole blood (5 × 10<sup>9</sup>RBCs/ml) will be 1.8 ms. A simple analytical expression for the half-life of NO in PBS with RBCs was derived in this study based on a spherical diffusion model. The calculated half-life of NO from the expression is in good agreement with the experimental values."

https://openalex.org/W2048575968,"DNA from excrements can be amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction. However, this has not been possible with ancient feces. Cross-links between reducing sugars and amino groups were shown to exist in a Pleistocene coprolite from Gypsum Cave, Nevada. A chemical agent, N -phenacylthiazolium bromide, that cleaves such cross-links made it possible to amplify DNA sequences. Analyses of these DNA sequences showed that the coprolite is derived from an extinct sloth, presumably the Shasta ground sloth Nothrotheriops shastensis . Plant DNA sequences from seven groups of plants were identified in the coprolite. The plant assemblage that formed part of the sloth's diet exists today at elevations about 800 meters higher than the cave."
https://openalex.org/W2077648546,"Activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is essential for T cell receptor (TCR) responsiveness; however, the function of individual PTK substrates is often uncertain. A mutant T cell line was isolated that lacked expression of SLP-76 (SH2 domain–containing leukocyte protein of 76 kilodaltons), a hematopoietically expressed adaptor protein and PTK substrate. SLP-76 was not required for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins, but was required for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), as well as Ras pathway activation. TCR-inducible gene expression was dependent on SLP-76. Thus, coupling of TCR-regulated PTKs to downstream signaling pathways requires SLP-76."
https://openalex.org/W2002943653,"The leukocyte-specific adapter molecule SLP-76 (Src homology 2 domain–containing leukocyte protein of 76 kilodaltons) is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after receptor ligation in several hematopoietically derived cell types. Mice made deficient for SLP-76 expression contained no peripheral T cells as a result of an early block in thymopoiesis. Macrophage and natural killer cell compartments were intact in SLP-76–deficient mice, despite SLP-76 expression in these lineages in wild-type mice. Thus, the SLP-76 adapter protein is required for normal thymocyte development and plays a crucial role in translating signals mediated by pre–T cell receptors into distal biochemical events."

We describe here the quantification of glyoxal and methylglyoxal-derived imidazolium cross-links in tissue proteins. The imidazolium salt cross-links, glyoxal-lysine dimer (GOLD) and methylglyoxal-lysine dimer (MOLD), were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and were present in lens protein at concentrations of 0.02–0.2 and 0.1–0.8 mmol/mol of lysine, respectively.

The presence of GOLD and MOLD in tissue proteins implicates methylglyoxal and glyoxal, either free or protein-bound, as important precursors of protein cross-links formed during Maillard reactions in vivo during aging and in disease. The Maillard reaction is a complex series of reactions between reducing sugars and amino groups on proteins, which lead to browning, fluorescence, and cross-linking of protein (1Hodge J.E. J. Agric.

Two other products of the reaction of GO or MGO with lysine, glyoxal-lysine dimer (GOLD) and methylglyoxal-lysine dimer (MOLD) (Fig. 1), were originally characterized in reactions of GO or MGO, respectively, with hippuryllysine (27Wells-Knecht K.J.

In the present study, we describe the reaction of MGO with the model protein bovine pancreatic RNase and quantify the role of MGO in cross-linking of the protein. Using a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) assay with15N-labeled GOLD and MOLD internal standards, we also measure the levels of GOLD and MOLD in lens protein and show that the concentrations of both cross-links increase in concert with chronological age in lens protein and skin collagen. Quantitative analysis indicates that MOLD is the major chemically characterized cross-link formed in lens protein during the Maillard reaction. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemical reagents were of the highest quality obtainable from Sigma, including MGO (40% aqueous solution) and RNase A (type XII-A). (Carboxymethyl)trimethylammonium chloride hydrazide (Girard's Reagent T) was obtained from Aldrich. SupelClean LC-18 cartridges were obtained from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA), and C-18 preparative material was obtained from the Waters Corporation (Milford, MA).15 N 2-l-Lysine·HCl was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA). For identification of products formed in reactions of MGO with the ε-amino groups of lysine, mixtures of 100 mmhippuryllysine and 100 or 200 mm MGO were incubated in 0.2m phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at various time points and analyzed by RP-HPLC. MOLD and GOLD were prepared by incubating 100 mm hippuryllysine with 200 mmMGO or GO in aqueous 200 mm formaldehyde. The reaction of MGO and hippuryllysine was conducted at 37 °C, and the reaction of GO and hippuryllysine was conducted at 65 °C. Additional MGO or GO (100 mm) and formaldehyde (100 mm) were added 8 times at hourly intervals and the reaction continued overnight. The pH dropped from 6 initially to 2.5 at the end of the reaction. The solutions were applied to a 0.75 × 10-cm column of C-18 preparative resin and eluted with a gradient of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in water. Fractions were analyzed for absorbance at 228 nm, and those containing hippuryl-MOLD or -GOLD, detected by RP-HPLC, were pooled, dried, and finally cleaned by semi-preparative HPLC, using the analytical RP-HPLC system described below. To obtain free MOLD or GOLD, the hippuryl group was removed by hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for 4 h at 110 °C. For preparation of the heavy labeled cross-links15N4-MOLD and15N4-GOLD,15N2-l-Nα-formyllysine (100 mm), prepared from15N2-l-lysine as described by Hofmann et al. (30Hofmann K. Stutz E. Spühler G. Yajima H. Schwartz E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 3727-3732Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was incubated with MGO or GO (200 mm) and formaldehyde (200 mm) in deionized water. The reactions were conducted for 30 h as described above. Deformylated MOLD and GOLD were obtained by hydrolysis in 6n HCl for 2 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysate was dried by centrifugal evaporation (Speed-Vac, Savant Instruments, Holbrook, NY) and reconstituted in water, and brown products were removed by applying the product to a Supelclean-LC18 column (3 ml) in water. The yield determined by cation exchange chromatography was approximately 60% for 15N4-MOLD and 50% for15N4-GOLD. RNase (20 mg/ml, 1.5 mm) was incubated with MGO (15 or 30 mm MGO at molar ratios to lysine of 1:1 or 2:1, respectively) in 0.2m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at various times and reduced with NaBH4 as described above. After quenching the reaction with acetic acid, the reduced protein was dialyzed against deionized water, concentrated by centrifugal evaporation, and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 22 h. The hydrolyzed protein was dried and applied to a Supelclean LC-18 column (1 ml) to remove brown products. The dried protein, dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water, was applied to sulfopropyl-cation exchange gel (SP-Sephadex C-25; 1.2 ml). Neutral and acidic amino acids were eluted with 25 ml of 0.05 n HCl and basic amino acids, including MOLD, with 7 ml of 1 n HCl. For phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) derivatization, the sample was dried, dissolved in 30 μl of coupling buffer (water:ethanol:triethylamine, 2:2:1), and dried. PITC derivatization was conducted with 50 μl of a mixture of ethanol, water, triethylamine, and PITC (7:1:1:1) as described by Bidlingmeyer et al. (31Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). The derivatization mixture was evaporated by centrifugal evaporation, and the residue was dissolved in deionized water. Excess derivatization reagent was extracted with n-heptane, discarding the organic layer. The phenylthiocarbamoyl (PTC) amino acids were dissolved in solvent A for RP-HPLC. Histidine, which was unaltered during reaction of the protein with MGO and was recovered quantitatively during this procedure, was used as the internal standard for quantitation of Lys, Arg, and MOLD. Amino acid analysis was performed using a Pickering sodium cation exchange column (25 cm × 4.6 mm) and sodium buffers (Pickering Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA), as described by the manufacturers. Amino acids were quantified by post-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde and fluorescence detection (20Ahmed M.U. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol.

Hippuryl-amino acids were analyzed by RP-HPLC either on a 25 cm × 4.6 mm Zorbax SB C-18 HPLC column (MAC-MOD Analytical Inc., Chadds Ford, PA) or on a 15 cm × 3 mm-Waters C-18 Symmetry column (Waters Corporation) using a detection wavelength of 228 nm. The gradient consisted of solvent A (0.05% acetic acid, 0.05% formic acid, and 0.1% triethylamine in water) and solvent B (75% solvent A in acetonitrile). The gradient program for the Zorbax column was: 0–50 min, 0–5% solvent B; 50–160 min, 5–100% solvent B; 160–190 min, wash with 100% acetonitrile, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; and for the Symmetry column: 0–30 min, 0–10% solvent B; 30–100 min, 10–100% solvent B; 100–105 min, wash with 100% acetonitrile, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. PTC amino acids were analyzed on a 15 cm × 4.6 mm-inner diameter 218TP54 protein and peptide C-18 column (VYDAC/The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) using a detection wavelength of 246 nm. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (12.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2) and solvent B (30% solvent A and 70% acetonitrile). The gradient was programmed as follows: 0–2 min, 0% solvent B; 2–40 min, 0–50% solvent B; 40–50 min, 50–100% solvent B; this was followed by a 10-min washing step with 100% acetonitrile, flow rate 1.2 ml/min. MGO was measured using Girard's Reagent T in 0.5 m formic acid, pH 2.9, as described by Mitchel and Birnboim (33Mitchel R.E.J. Birnboim H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 81: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), using absorbance at 292 nm for quantitation. SDS-PAGE was conducted under reducing conditions using a 4% stacking gel and a 15% separating gel as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Human lenses were obtained from the South Carolina Lions Eye Bank (Columbia, SC) and stored at −70 °C until used. Lenses were decapsulated, homogenized and dialyzed against deionized water, as described previously (26Dunn J.A. Patrick J.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W.

Total lens protein was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysate was dried and then applied to an SP-Sephadex cation exchange resin to recover basic amino acids, washed, and eluted, as described above. The eluent was dried by centrifugal evaporation and reconstituted in buffer A (sodium eluent, pH 3.15) for amino acid analysis. Fractions in the time interval including lysine, MOLD, and GOLD (15–25 min, 6 ml total volume) were collected. These pools were diluted with deionized water to 50 ml, acidified with 4 nHCl to pH 1–2, applied to a 2 ml-DOWEX-50W cation (sodium form), and desalted by washing with 70 ml of 0.5 n HCl; then the basic amino acids were eluted with 4 n HCl. The eluent was dried and derivatized for PTC amino acid analysis as described above. Human skin collagen was isolated by full thickness biopsy from the upper buttock, as described previously in detail (24Dyer D.G. Dunn J.A. Thorpe S.R. Bailie K.E. Lyons T.J. McCance D.R. Baynes J.W.

Briefly, the skin was scraped to remove adventitious tissue, extracted sequentially for 24 h with 1 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and with 0.5 m acetic acid to remove soluble proteins, and then extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) to remove any residual lipid. The collagen was hydrolyzed and analyzed as described above for lens proteins. For LC/MS analysis about 2 mg of lens protein was mixed with 3 nmol of 15N4-MOLD and 2.5 nmol of15N4-GOLD or 4 mg of young (18 years) and old (85 years) pools of human skin collagen with 1.5 nmol of15N4-MOLD and 1.25 nmol of15N4-GOLD. The samples were hydrolyzed, processed, and derivatized with PITC, as described above. Gradient HPLC/MS analysis was performed using a 100 × 1-mm Hypersil ODS column (Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA) with a 2 × 1-mm guard column. The gradient consisted of solvent A (90% water, 10% methanol, and 0.3% glacial acetic acid) and solvent B (20% water, 80% methanol, and 0.3% glacial acetic acid). The gradient was: 100% solvent A for 5 min, then to 100% solvent B at 15 min, and hold at 100% solvent B for 20 min; the flow rate was 50 μl/min. The ion source was an Analytica of Branford Inc. electrospray model 103443 (Branford, CT), operating with the following settings: cylinder voltage, −2600 V; end cap voltage, −3700 V; capillary voltage, −4800 V; current, 4 × 10−8 A; source temperature, 275 °C; needlegas pressure, 38 p.s.i.; lens 1–6 voltages, 147.8, 25.6, 25.4, 2.7, 0, and −49.1 V. The mass spectrometer was a VG TRIO triple quadrupole mass analyzer (Beverly, MA) operating at: dwell time, 150 ms; delay time, 20 ms; and photomultiplier voltage, 600 V. The masses monitored were 417 amu for PTC-Lys+H+, 597 amu for (PTC)2-GOLD, 601 amu for (PTC)2-15N4-GOLD, 611 amu for (PTC)2-MOLD, and 615 amu for (PTC)2-15N4-MOLD. All assays were analyzed in a single batch to exclude interassay variation. Results of single analyses of each sample are shown. The intra-assay coefficients of variation for assay of GOLD and MOLD, measured at the mid-range of the samples, were 14 and 12%, respectively (n = 5). As reported previously, GOLD and MOLD were originally isolated from reactions of GO or MGO, respectively, with the model peptideNα-hippuryllysine (27Wells-Knecht K.J. Brinkmann E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 6246-6247Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Brinkmann E. Wells-Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1995; 1: 2817-2818Crossref Google Scholar). RP-HPLC analysis of reactions of MGO with hippuryllysine (MGO:Lys, 2:1) yielded two major products (Fig. 2 A) subsequently identified asNα-hippuryl-CEL and (Nα-hippuryl)2-MOLD. Acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis also yielded two major products, CEL and MOLD (Fig. 2 B). The identity of CEL was confirmed by its elution time on HPLC analysis and by GC/MS analysis of its trifluoroacetyl methyl ester derivative (M+ = 438 amu) (21Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). ESI mass spectrometry was used for identification of (Nα-hippuryl)2-MOLD and MOLD (M+ = 663 and 341 amu, respectively, before and after acid hydrolysis) (28Brinkmann E. Wells-Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1995; 1: 2817-2818Crossref Google Scholar). Yields were ∼12% CEL and ∼32% MOLD, based on original Nα-hippuryllysine. Similar results were obtained from reactions of GO withNα-hippuryllysine, yielding ∼33% CML and ∼32% GOLD (27Wells-Knecht K.J. Brinkmann E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 6246-6247Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In numerous reactions of GO or MGO with Nα-hippuryllysine or proteins (RNase or albumin) at a variety of concentration ratios, both carboxyalkyllysines and imidazolium salt compounds were always formed together. Yields and relative yields varied with absolute concentrations and concentration ratios, as described for RNase in Fig. 3. Browning was more rapid and intense in reactions containing MGO, indicating a higher yield of melanoidins from MGO, compared with GO.Figure 3Detection of MOLD in MGO-modified RNase by RP-HPLC. RNase was incubated with MGO (MGO:Lys = 2:1) in 0.2m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 24 h at 37 °C. Basic amino acids were isolated from the protein hydrolysate by chromatography on SP-Sephadex as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then derivatized with PITC for HPLC analysis. Theinset shows the enlarged view of the elution time frame of MOLD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because MGO is present in higher concentrations in biological systems than GO (14Thornalley P.J. McLellan A.C. Lo T.W.C. Benn J. Soenksen P.H. Clin. Sci. ( Lond. ). 1996; 91: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we concentrated on the reactions of MGO with protein. Reactions of MGO with the model protein RNase were studied under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C). MGO was reacted with RNase, which has 10 lysine residues, at molar ratios of MGO:Lys, 1:1 and 2:1. As shown in Fig. 3, MOLD was readily detectable in MGO- modified RNase by RP-HPLC of the PTC derivative. The identity of the MOLD was confirmed by co-elution with an authentic standard and by its molecular mass of (PTC)2-MOLD (611 amu) measured by ESI-MS. The kinetics of the formation of MOLD described in Fig. 4 A were consistent with the kinetics of the disappearance of MGO from the reaction mixture (Fig. 4 B). The half-life of MGO in the presence of the protein was ∼4 h at both concentrations, whereas in phosphate buffer alone it disappeared with a half-life of ∼30 h (Fig. 4 B). The yield of MOLD increased 4–5-fold on doubling of the MGO concentration, an observation confirmed in two independent experiments, consistent with either a rate-limiting second order process or the requirement for 2 mol of MGO/mol of MOLD formed. In contrast, lysine and arginine decreased to similar extents at both MGO concentrations, yielding maximal modification of 5–6 of 10 lysine and 3 of 4 arginine residues in RNase (Fig. 4, C and D). The possibility that some free lysine and arginine were generated during acid hydrolysis cannot be excluded; however, the extent of the lack of reactivity of 3–4 lysine residues was confirmed by reaction with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (data not shown). Although ≥50% of lysine residues were modified in these reactions with formation of 20 or 95 mmol MOLD, only 1 or 3.6%, respectively, of the lysine loss could be accounted for as MOLD. CEL, measured by GC/MS (data not shown), accounted for an additional 1.3 or 1.6% of the total lysine modification (21Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Thus, MOLD and CEL accounted for ≤5% of the modification of lysine residues in the protein. Browning, cross-linking, and formation of fluorescent products also occurred, indicating that other unidentified products were formed. As shown in Fig. 5, the time course of cross-linking of RNase, estimated by SDS-PAGE, was consistent with the rate of formation of MOLD (Fig. 4 A).Figure 5SDS-PAGE analysis of cross-linking of RNase during reaction with MGO.

Fractions were pooled, as indicated in the figure, and then analyzed for their MOLD content. As shown in the inset to Fig. 6, the MOLD content of RNase increased with the extent of polymerization of the protein. These data indicate that MOLD contributes to both inter- and intramolecular cross-linking of lysine residues in RNase; however, the yield of MOLD in the RNase dimer fraction (Fig. 6,inset) accounted for only about 5% of intermolecular cross-links, indicating that other cross-links were also formed. Human lens proteins were analyzed for their MOLD and GOLD content using the RP-HPLC analytical procedure described in Fig. 3. The lens proteins were analyzed as a function of age, because both CEL and CML accumulate in these proteins with age (21Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 26Dunn J.A. Patrick J.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9454-9468Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, both MOLD and GOLD were detectable by RP-HPLC in the hydrolysate of lens protein. The peak identities were confirmed by co-elution with an authentic standard, but the reliability of the assay was questionable because of the low levels of MOLD and GOLD in lens proteins and their possible co-elution with other trace compounds in protein. To obtain more reliable results, we applied an LC/MS procedure to analyze lens protein hydrolysates that were derivatized with PITC. Heavy labeled MOLD and GOLD were prepared from 15N2-lysine for use as internal standards. Nonlabeled PTC2-MOLD and PTC2-GOLD were detected at the masses 611 and 597 amu, respectively, and their heavy labeled counterparts at 615 and 601 amu, respectively. Fig. 8 shows an RP-HPLC/SIM-ESI chromatogram of PITC-derivatized lens protein, confirming detection of both GOLD and MOLD in lens protein. The standard curves (inset) were prepared by adding increasing amounts of natural GOLD and MOLD to a fixed amount of internal standard.Figure 8Determination of MOLD and GOLD in human lens proteins by LC/MS. Heavy labeled standards were added to lens protein prior to acid hydrolysis. The protein was hydrolyzed, basic amino acids isolated, and amino acid derivatized with PITC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using HPLC-ESI-MS, the masses recorded were 597 amu for GOLD, 601 amu for15N4-GOLD, 611 amu for MOLD, and 615 for15N4-MOLD.

When extended versions of the ovalbumin-derived epitope SIINFEKL are expressed in vivo, the correct C terminus is generated by proteasomal cleavage, but distinct cytosolic protease(s) generate its N terminus. To identify the other protease(s) involved in antigen processing, we incubated soluble extracts of HeLa cells with the 11-mer QLESIINFEKL, whichin vivo is processed to the antigenic 8-mer (SIINFEKL) by a proteasome-independent pathway. This 11-mer was converted to the 9-mer by sequential removal of the N-terminal residues, but surprisingly the extract showed little or no endopeptidase or carboxypeptidase activity against this precursor. After treatment of cells with IFN-γ, this N-terminal trimming was severalfold faster and proceeded to the antigenic 8-mer. The IFN-treated cells also showed greater aminopeptidase activity against many model fluorogenic substrates. Upon extract fractionation, three bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase peaks were detected. One was induced by IFN-γ and was identified immunologically as leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). Purified LAP, like the extracts of IFN-γ-treated cells, processed the 11-mer peptide to SIINFEKL. Thus, IFN-γ not only promotes proteasomal cleavages that determine the C termini of antigenic peptides, but also can stimulate formation of their N termini by inducing LAP. This enzyme appears to catalyze the trimming of the N terminus of this and presumably other proteasome-derived precursors. Thus, susceptibility to LAP may be an important influence on the generation on immunodominant epitopes.

Mammalian cells present to the immune system small fragments of intracellular proteins in the form of 8–10-residue peptides bound to surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LAP, leucine aminopeptidase; IFN, interferon; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; AMC, aminomethylcoumarin; pkLAP, porcine kidney LAP. class I molecules. This process allows cytotoxic T cells to screen for intracellular pathogens (e.g. viruses) and for transformed cells. The great majority of these antigenic peptides is generated during the course of protein degradation by 20 S or 26 S proteasomes (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), which catalyze the breakdown of most cell proteins. Nearly all of the peptide products of the proteasomes undergo rapid proteolytic destruction to amino acids. However, some oligopeptides, perhaps after further proteolytic processing, are transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they bind to MHC class I molecules, and this complex is transported to the cell surface (2Germain R.N. Margulies D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 403-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 3Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Curr. Opin.

Many lines of evidence have indicated that the proteasome is essential for the generation of most antigenic peptides. 1) Proteasome inhibitors, such as peptide aldehydes (5Harding C.V. France J. Song R. Farah J.M. Chatterjee S. Iqbal M. Siman R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1767-1775PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L.

Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Grant E.P. Michalek M.T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3750-3758PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The cytokine IFN-γ, which stimulates many steps in antigen presentation, induces the expression of three special β-subunits (LMP2, LMP7, and MECL1). Their incorporation into the 20 S proteasome modifies its peptidase activities and thus appears to increase the generation of peptides with hydrophobic and basic C termini (11Aki M. Shimbara N.

Such peptides are selectively transported into the ER (15van Endert P.M. Riganelli D. Greco G. Fleischhauer K. Sidney J. Sette A. Bach J.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1883-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and bind preferentially to MHC class I molecules (16Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanoviic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). These adaptations are clearly important in vivo, since deletion of LMP2 (17Van Kaer L. Ashton-Rickardt P.G.

Science. 1994; 265: 1234-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) genes in mice leads to defects in their ability to generate cytotoxic T-cell responses. 4) IFN-γ also induces an 11 S complex, PA28, which stimulates the proteasome's peptidase activity (19Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ma C.P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus may also promote antigen presentation (21Groettrup M. Soza A. Eggers M. Kuehn L. Dick T.P. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.M. Nature. 1996; 381: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). One important aspect of this process that is poorly understood concerns the exact fate of peptides released by the proteasome. The peptide-binding cleft of the MHC class I molecule binds strongly only peptides of 8–10 residues in length (22Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar, 23Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The sizes of the peptides containing antigenic epitopes that are released by the mammalian proteasomes are unknown. Recently, proteasomes from the achaeon, Thermoplasma acidophilum, have been shown to cleave proteins to peptides ranging in length from 3 to 25 amino acids. Even though the eukaryotic proteasome has many fewer active sites, and these sites differ in cleavage specificity (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), it generates peptides during protein breakdown whose size distribution resembles that of the achaeal proteasome (25Dick L.R. Aldrich C. Jameson S.C. Moomaw C.R. Pramanik B.C. Doyle C.K. DeMartino G.N. Bevan M.J. Forman J.M. Slaughter C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3884-3894PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. F. Kisselev, T. Akopian, K. M. Woo, and A. L. Goldberg, submitted for publication. With both types of proteasomes, 10–15% of the peptide products are of the correct length for MHC class I binding (24Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 1982-1987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It thus remains unclear whether most presented peptides are produced directly by the proteasome, as suggested by some workers (27Niedermann G. King G. Butz S. Birsner U. Grimm R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Eichmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8572-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H-G. Nature. 1996; 365: 262-264Google Scholar), or whether additional proteolytic steps are necessary to generate the final 8–10-mers (29Craiu A. Aklopian T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (see below). Also, the enzymatic steps in epitope production may differ for different proteins. One of the epitopes studied more extensively is the ovalbumin-derived, H2-Kb-presented epitope, SIINFEKL. When SDS-activated 20 S proteasomes were incubated with ovalbumin (25Dick L.R. Aldrich C. Jameson S.C. Moomaw C.R. Pramanik B.C. Doyle C.K. DeMartino G.N. Bevan M.J. Forman J.M. Slaughter C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3884-3894PubMed Google Scholar) or with fragments of ovalbumin (27Niedermann G. King G. Butz S. Birsner U. Grimm R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Eichmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8572-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for prolonged periods, SIINFEKL was generated, but also some N-terminal-extended versions of this peptide were produced. However, the physiological relevance of such experiments is unclear; for example, it remains questionable whether the products released by these 20 S particles under these artificial conditions are the same as those generated from ubiquitinated proteins by the 26 S proteasomesin vivo.2 Craiu and co-workers (29Craiu A. Aklopian T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) showed that if longer peptides that contain this antigenic sequence are injected into cells or expressed from minigenes, these peptides could be proteolytically trimmed to SIINFEKL and be presented on surface MHC class I molecules. Interestingly, generation of this antigenic peptide from ovalbumin with C-terminal extensions of SIINFEKL of 1–15 amino acids was completely blocked by treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor, β-lactone (29Craiu A. Aklopian T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although the proteasome thus seems to play a critical role in the generation of the C terminus of this antigenic peptide, this particle was not necessary for the cleavages that define their N termini. When peptides containing 2–25 additional residues on the N terminus of SIINFEKL were expressed or injected into cells, SIINFEKL was presented by MHC class I molecules, and this process was not affected by a proteasome inhibitor. The 20 S proteasome, although it contains several endopeptidase activities, lacks aminopeptidase activity. Thus, some other proteolytic enzyme(s) must be generating the correct N terminus of this (and presumably of other) antigenic peptides. Several findings indicate that the major peptidase(s) active in this N-terminal trimming are located in the cytosol (29Craiu A. Aklopian T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For example, a SIINFEKL-containing precursor with 25 additional N-terminal residues was efficiently trimmed to the presented octapeptide by a non-proteasomal mechanism. However, peptides longer than 16 residues are quite poor substrates for the TAP transporter on the ER (30Momburg F. Roelse J. Hammerling G.J. Neefjes J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1613-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, most of the additional N-terminal residues must have been cleaved off in the cytosol before uptake into the ER for MHC class I binding, although some exopeptidase(s) clearly capable of trimming antigenic peptides are also found in the ER (31Eisenlohr L.C. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Bernstein K. Yewdell J.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Snyder H.L. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2389-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A number of cytosolic proteases degrade preferentially oligopeptides and therefore may function in the trimming or further degradation of proteasome products, including the heterogenous group of aminopeptidases (33Tisljar U.

Unidentified bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidases have been shown to catalyze the final steps in the ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway in the conversion of small peptides to amino acids (33Tisljar U.

The present experiments were undertaken to investigate which cytosolic proteases may be involved in the post-proteasomal processing of class I-presented peptides, and specifically in the cytosolic trimming of N-terminal-extended peptides to SIINFEKL. In addition, we have tested whether IFN-γ treatment, which promotes many important steps in antigen presentation, also stimulates the processing of such peptides. Peptides with the sequences SIINFEKL, ESIINFEKL, LESIINFEKL, and QLESIINFEKL were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO) and were over 90% pure (by HPLC analysis). The peptides were dissolved at 10 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −80 °C. Purified porcine kidney leucine aminopeptidase and tissue carboxypeptidase A were obtained from Sigma. Bestatin was purchased from Sigma and the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Cbz-LLLal), was kindly provided by ProScript Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The 10-mer QLESIINFEK was prepared by incubation of the 11-mer with carboxypeptidase A, and the product was isolated by HPLC. The human cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa S3, and the human macrophage cell line, U937, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irving Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HeLa and U937 cells were treated for 5 days with 1500 and 3000 units/ml of human recombinant IFN-γ (a kind gift from Biogen, Cambridge, MA). Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer and by vortexing with glass beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4. Cytosolic extracts were prepared by centrifugation of the homogenates for 20 min at 10,000 ×g and 1 h at 100,000 × g, and proteasomes were removed by an additional 6 h centrifugation at 100,000 × g. All extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. For some experiments, the residual proteasomes in the extracts were inactivated by incubation with 100 μm MG132 for 15 min at room temperature. Aminopeptidase activity was analyzed using fluorogenic substrates of the amino acid-AMC type (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA). Substrates containing 19 different N-terminal amino acids (except tryptophan) were used at a concentration of 200 μm of each in a 1-ml volume of 50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.5. Substrate hydrolysis was determined using 10 μg of cytosolic proteins from HeLa or U937 cells, as measured using the Coomassie kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Samples were incubated for 75 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 10% SDS, and then fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm in a SLM-AMINCO spectrometer (Rochester, NY). Analysis of fractionated extracts was carried out with 50 μl of each fraction in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.5, stopped after 75 min incubation at 37 °C with 500 μl of 2% SDS, and analyzed as described above. 5 nmol of the synthetic peptide QLESIINFEKLwas incubated with 10 μg of extract from HeLa cells or with 25 μg of extract from U937 cells in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.5, for various times at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by 15 min incubation on ice, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. The peptide-containing supernatant was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on a 4.6 × 250-mm Macrosphere 300A C8-column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) at 40 °C in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Elution was performed with a 25-min linear gradient from 15 to 40% acetonitrile. The eluted peptides were detected by measuring their absorbance at 214 nm. The relative concentrations of each eluted peptide were calculated by integration of the areas under the peaks and are given in arbitrary units. Fractionation of 2 mg of U937 and 0.5 mg of HeLa cell extracts was performed by ion-exchange chromatography in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, on a 1-ml MonoQ 5/5 column (Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden). Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-min linear salt gradient from 0 to 0.5 m sodium chloride and with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluted peptides were measured at 280 nm, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected for further analysis. The identification and measurements of LAP in soluble extracts were done by immunoblot analysis. 30 μg of crude extract or 20 μl of each sample from fractionated extracts were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). The filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit antiserum against bovine lens LAP (kindly provided by A. Taylor, Tufts University, Boston, MA). Bound antibodies were detected with125iodinated-protein A (NEN Life Science Products) and visualized and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Because in vivo studies (29Craiu A. Aklopian T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) indicated that cytosolic protease(s) distinct from the proteasome generate the N terminus of the MHC class I-presented SIINFEKL from longer precursors, such as QLESIINFEKL, we tested whether a similar processing of this precursor occurs in soluble extracts of HeLa cells. The processing reaction was followed until the antigenic 8-mer was generated (on the assumption that once the 8-mer is generated in vivo, it would be efficiently transported into the ER and would bind to MHC class I molecules where it would be protected from further proteolysis). In principle, conversion of the ovalbumin-derived 11-mer to SIINFEKL can occur by a single endoproteolytic cleavage, by sequential removal of the N-terminal residues (generating the 10-mer and then the 9-mer), or by some mixture of endo- and exopeptidase reactions. To follow these reactions, an assay using reverse-phase HPLC was developed, which allowed resolution of the 11-mer (QLESIINFEKL), 10-mer (LESIINFEKL), 10-mer (QLESIINFEK), 9-mer (ESIINFEKL), and 8-mer (SIINFEKL) peptides. The 11-mer peptide QLESIINFEKL was incubated with the 100,000 × g supernatant from HeLa cells at 37 °C for various periods of time. To prevent proteasomal activity, the extracts were depleted of proteasomes by prolonged ultracentrifugation, and any residual activity was blocked by the addition of the inhibitor, MG132 (37Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), which blocks proteasome function, but does not inhibit aminopeptidases or carboxypeptidases. The reaction was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid, and the peptide-containing supernatant was fractionated by HPLC. Determination of the retention times of standard peptides allowed us to test whether the same peptides were generated in the extracts, and their relative concentrations were determined by integration of peak areas. Initially, the 11-mer was the only peptide peak detected at 214 nm in the HeLa extract (Fig. 1). The lack of endogenous peptides in these undialyzed extracts confirms prior observations that the concentration of free peptides in the mammalian cytosol is very low (38Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). Extract concentrations (100 μg/ml) were studied that allowed easy measurement of the disappearance of the added 11-mer in a few hours. In the extracts, the amount of the added 11-mer decreased at a linear rate, and by 3 h, nearly 50% had disappeared (Fig. 2). After 30 min, additional peaks could be detected, which correspond to the 10-mer and 9-mer. These two peptides increased with time and reached similar maximal levels at 2 and 3 h. Only a very small peak corresponding to the C-terminal truncated 10-mer (QLESIINFEK) was detected after addition of the 11-mer to the HeLa extracts (data not shown). In these extracts, the amount of this C-terminal truncated peptide was always much less than the amounts of the N-terminal truncated peptides. These findings and inhibitor studies (see below) all indicated that in these preparations peptide processing occurred primarily by aminopeptidase(s), with little or no carboxypeptidase activity or endoproteolytic generation of the 9- or 8-mer.Figure 2The kinetics of the disappearance of QLESIINFEKL and the generation of smaller peptides in extracts from control and IFN-treated HeLa cells. The levels of the 11-mer and related products were analyzed in the two extracts at 30-min intervals, as described in Fig. 1. The relative amounts of all peptides were calculated by integration of the peptide peaks on the chromatogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since IFN-γ is known to alter the peptidase activity of the proteasome (11Aki M.

Science. 1994; 265: 1234-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and to promote expression of other components of the antigen presentation pathway, we tested whether IFN-γ also promotes processing of the 11-mer. In extracts from IFN-treated HeLa cells, the 11-mer disappeared 2 to 3 times faster than in the control extract (Fig. 2). At the same time, IFN treatment stimulated the generation of the 10- and 9-mer by 2.2–2.4-fold. After 90 min, the antigenic 8-mer SIINFEKL was present in the extract from the IFN-treated cells. The amount of SIINFEKL increased with time, although its level was always much less than that of the 10- or 9-mer. By contrast, SIINFEKL was not detected at any time in the control extract. These findings indicate sequential trimming of the precursor by an IFN-induced aminopeptidase(s). Since the sum of the amounts of 10-, 9-, and 8-mer peptides recovered at every time point nearly equaled the amount of the 11-mer that had disappeared, no other protease contributes significantly to the destruction of the 11-mer or to the generation of the 8-mer. We tested whether the enzyme that processes QLESIINFEKL was sensitive to bestatin, a competitive inhibitor of many aminopeptidases. When the extracts of HeLa cells were preincubated with bestatin at a concentration (100 μm) that inhibited the aminopeptidase activity against Leu-, Gln-, and Lys-AMC by 80–99% (data not shown), the rates of disappearance of the 11-mer and of the appearance of the 10-mer in control and IFN-treated HeLa cell extracts decreased by 50% (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in the bestatin-treated extracts, neither the 9-mer nor the antigenic 8-mer could be detected. These data further argue that aminopeptidases are responsible for the generation of SIINFEKL. Presumably, this inhibition by bestatin is only partial, because the 11-mer has a much higher affinity than the amino acid-AMC substrates. Alternatively, there may well be some bestatin-resistant aminopeptidase that converts it to the 10-mer. In fact, in a similar experiment with extracts from U937 cells (data not shown), the disappearance of the 11-mer was not affected by bestatin in the control extract, but was inhibited by 50% in the extract from IFN-treated cells. Thus, in U937 cells, multiple peptidases can degrade the 11-mer, but the IFN-induced N-terminal removal also involves a bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase. To further characterize the aminopeptidase(s) induced by IFN-γ, we used a variety of fluorogenic aminopeptidase substrates. Initial experiments with control and IFN-treated HeLa and U937 extracts using Leu-AMC as substrate indicated that its hydrolysis occurred at a linear rate for up to 75 min. The rate of this reaction was directly proportional to the substrate concentration (which ranged from 50 to 600 μm) and to the amounts of extract protein (which ranged from 10 to 50 μg) (data not shown). In extracts from IFN-treated cells, the rate of Leu-AMC hydrolysis was consistently 2–3-fold higher than in extracts from controls. We then compared the activity of the control and IFN-treated cell extracts against 18 other amino acid-AMC substrates (Table I). The substrates fell into two groups, according to their rates of hydrolysis. In control extract, the amino acid-AMC substrates containing Leu, Lys, Met, Cys, Phe, Arg, Ala, Pro, and Tyr were hydrolyzed at least 2–20-fold faster than those containing Thr, Gln, Glu, Asn, His, Val, Ser, Ile, Asp, and Gly.Table IHydrolysis rates for 19 amino acids in soluble extracts from control and IFN-treated HeLa and U937 cells and pkLAPSubstrate, X-AMCHeLa cellsU937 cellspkLAPControlIFN-treatedControlIFN-treatednmol/mg/hDifference% Stimulationnmol/mg/hDifference% Stimulationnmol/mg/hGood substrates L741164257521045210053 K8710417206771465.7 M448036823757205429 C2741145221452411426 F3558236622264189.7 R33375123639385.5 A344612352325297.6 P1918−0.1019212102.7 Y10166609.1100.9102.1Poor substrates T3.14.91.8580.73.42.73862.3 Q3.66.93.3921.75.742354.0 E2.53.20.7280.410.61500.7 N2.91.7−1.200.91.30.4443 H0.92.11.21330.31.51.24001.4 V1.62.40.8500.91.30.4440.7 S1.62.40.8500.40.60.2500.3 I1.11.90.8730.81.50.2880.7 D0.92.71.82001.71.6−0.100.9 G1.720.3180.20.40.2100NDaND, not determined.Substrate hydrolysis was determined in a peptidase assay with 10 μg of extract or 0.05 μg of pure pkLAP and 200 μm of each amino acid-AMC.

https://openalex.org/W2136220801,"Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2) exhibits a highly restricted tissue distribution, suggesting that it serves more specialized physiological functions than some of the other isoforms. A unique role in hearing is indicated by the high levels of PMCA2 expression in cochlear outer hair cells and spiral ganglion cells. To analyze the physiological role of PMCA2 we used gene targeting to produce PMCA2-deficient mice. Breeding of heterozygous mice yielded live homozygous mutant offspring. PMCA2-null mice grow more slowly than heterozygous and wild-type mice and exhibit an unsteady gait and difficulties in maintaining balance. Histological analysis of the cerebellum and inner ear of mutant and wild-type mice revealed that null mutants had slightly increased numbers of Purkinje neurons (in which PMCA2 is highly expressed), a decreased thickness of the molecular layer, an absence of otoconia in the vestibular system, and a range of abnormalities of the organ of Corti. Analysis of auditory evoked brainstem responses revealed that homozygous mutants were deaf and that heterozygous mice had a significant hearing loss. These data demonstrate that PMCA2 is required for both balance and hearing and suggest that it may be a major source of the calcium used in the formation and maintenance of otoconia."

https://openalex.org/W1567403197,"In developing organs, the regulation of cell proliferation and patterning of cell fates is coordinated. How this coordination is achieved, however, is unknown. In the developing Drosophila wing, both cell proliferation and patterning require the secreted morphogen Wingless (Wg) at the dorsoventral compartment boundary. Late in wing development, Wg also induces a zone of non-proliferating cells at the dorsoventral boundary. This zone gives rise to sensory bristles of the adult wing margin. Here we investigate how Wg coordinates the cell cycle with patterning by studying the regulation of this growth arrest. We show that Wg, in conjunction with Notch, induces arrest in both the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle in separate subdomains of the zone of non-proliferating cells. Wg induces G2 arrest in two subdomains by inducing the proneural genes achaete and scute, which downregulate the mitosis-inducing phosphatase String (Cdc25). Notch activity creates a third domain by preventing arrest at G2 in wg-expressing cells, resulting in their arrest in G1."

Nutr. 1996; 126: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). How and where the iron exits from ferritin in vivo is not known. We now show that localized unfolding in the assembled protein, at sites of cooperative subunit interactions, can increase the rate of exit of iron from ferritin. When conserved leucine 134 was replaced by proline (L134P), the protein assembled, oxidized Fe(II), and mineralized Fe(III), but the time for complete dissolution of mineral (480 iron)in vitro was greatly decreased (5 min compared with 150 min for the parent protein). X-ray diffraction studies of crystals of H-L134P ferritin showed a flexible region localized near the termini of two subunit helices (C, D), which form the interfaces of subunit trimers and a channel. The results indicate that iron can exit from ferritin at the trimer subunit junction. A possible mechanism for regulated iron release in vivo could be localized disorder in the assembled protein, enhanced by cytoplasmic changes with effects analogous to the effect of H-L134P.

Biol. 1995; 248: 949-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 3In animal tissues, ferritins are usually found as mixtures with fast (H/M) and slow (L) ferritin subunits in varying ratios under strict genetic control; H/L ratios differ, for example, in ferritin from blood cells, hepatocytes, and macrophages (1Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Suslick K.S. Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry. 5. Pergamon, Oxford1996: 65-89Google Scholar, 2Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar, 20Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). H, M, L, or mixtures of H, M, and L subunits spontaneously fold and assemble into the 24-mer. In nature, the iron minerals in ferritin range in average size from 800 to 2500 iron/molecule and from microcrystalline to amorphous, particularly when the phosphate content is high (1Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Suslick K.S. Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry. 5. Pergamon, Oxford1996: 65-89Google Scholar, 2Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). The heterodispersity of mineral size in natural ferritin varies from ∼10 to 4000 iron/molecule and is much greater than in minerals reconstituted to 480 iron/molecule from the iron-free protein (15Mertz J.R. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11719-11726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study iron release, Fe(II) was added to the recombinant ferritin proteins to form iron minerals of constant average size (480 iron/molecule). The role of ferritin in iron release was compared for proteins that differed over 1000-fold in iron uptake rates and in the mechanism of iron oxidation (fast-ferroxidase sites and nucleation sites present, slow-only nucleation sites present). The initial rates of iron oxidation by proteins with ferroxidase sites were 0.99 ± 0.02 (A 650/s) for H ferritin, 0.081 ± 0.038 (A 550/s) for H-L134P ferritin (13Fetter J. Cohen J. Danger D. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 652-661Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and 1.55 ± 0.22 (A 650/s) for M ferritin (13Fetter J. Cohen J. Danger D. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 652-661Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The slower rate of iron uptake/ferroxidation for the H-L134P protein is coupled to a shift in the absorbance maximum of the initial Fe(III) complex from 650 to 550 nm (Fig. 1) and a slower decay (12Waldo G.S. Ling J. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. Science. 1993; 259: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Fetter J. Cohen J. Danger D. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 652-661Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but the formation rate is still within the range for fast ferritins and 100-fold faster than L ferritin (13Fetter J. Cohen J. Danger D. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 652-661Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). L ferritin has no specific ferroxidation site, and the initial rate of oxidation is 0.0037 ± 0.0017 (A 350/s) (11Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13262-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Iron exit from the mineralized recombinant ferritins was triggered by reduction of Fe(III) with FMNH2/NADH and trapping the Fe(II) as the Fe(II)-bipyridyl complex. No Fe(II)-bipyridyl complex was detected until the reductant was added, and essentially all (96%) of the Fe(II)-bipyridyl complex that formed could be separated from the protein by ultrafiltration (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that the reductive release of iron is independent of reductant/chelator size (8Watt G.D. Frankel R.B. Papaefthymiou G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3640-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Watt G.D. Jacobs D. Frankel R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rates of iron release from recombinant ferritins were biphasic (Fig. 2 A). There was little difference in iron release rates among the recombinant ferritins with natural sequences. In contrast to the wild type proteins (H, M, L), substitution of leucine 134, conserved in all ferritins (1Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Suslick K.S. Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry. 5. Pergamon, Oxford1996: 65-89Google Scholar, 2Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar), with proline had a faster initial rate of iron release (Fig. 2) that was essentially monophasic. Complete dissolution of a ferritin mineral of 480 iron and release as Fe(II)-bipyridyl only required 5 min in the H-L134P protein compared with 150 min for the parent protein with L134. Crystals formed by frog H ferritin with L134P showed localized changes in the subunit packing at the junction of three subunits (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the crystals of H-L134P had a very large and complex unit cell, also observed for frog M ferritin (25Ha Y. Theil E.C. Allewell N.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), glutamine was substituted for lysine at position 82 (K82Q) or arginine at position 86 (R86Q) in the BC loop to allow formation of cubic crystals as previously observed for human H-K82Q ferritin (21Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Thomas C.D. Shaw W.V. Harrison P.M. Nature. 1991; 349: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). 4Two numbering systems have been used for ferritin sequences. The initial numbering scheme, based on the horse spleen ferritin sequence (34Banyard S.H. Stammers D.K. Harrison P.M. Nature. 1978; 271: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), can be used for all sequences (1Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Suslick K.S. Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry. 5. Pergamon, Oxford1996: 65-89Google Scholar, 2Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar), but separate numbering for human ferritin sequences has also been used (21Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Thomas C.D. Shaw W.V. Harrison P.M.

Biol. 1997; 268: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The uniform numbering system is used here; thus 4 must be added from residue numbering for the human H ferritin sequence to relate to the H/L equivalent numbering system. This crystal form of frog H-L134P, K82Q was isomorphous to human H-K82Q (21Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Thomas C.D. Shaw W.V. Harrison P.M. Nature. 1991; 349: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) and frog L ferritin crystals, making the structure solution straightforward. The polyalanine model of human H-K82Q ferritin (Protein Data Bank reference 1fha) was used as a starting model. The electron density maps for both frog H-L134P, K82Q and H-L134P, R86Q ferritins are of high quality except at the ends of helices C and D and CD loop, residues 114–133. Despite thorough efforts to model this region using different conformers from the Protein Data Bank, the weak density remained throughout refinement, in contrast to all other high resolution ferritin structures determined to date (21Lawson D.M.

The data from this region were excluded from the refinement.Figure 42Fo-Fc map from residue 108 to 138 in crystals of recombinant frog ferritin.

Rapid oxidation occurs in the center of the 4-helix bundle that forms the ferritin subunit and involves residues from helices A, B, and C (1Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Suslick K.S.

In contrast residue 134, which when changed to proline altered rates of iron exit, is near the N terminus of helix D (21Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A.

The backbone nitrogen of Leu-134 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu-129, whereas the side chain of Leu-134 has a hydrophobic interaction with Leu-110 in helix C. A kink in the backbone of the helix D adjacent to residue 134, produced by deviations from the standard dihedral angles at positions 132 and 133 (24Hempstead P.D. Yewdall S.J. Fernie A.R. Lawson D.M.

Biol. 1997; 268: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), determines precise positioning of the interhelical and intersubunit interactions of the D helix near the subunit trimer interface. The L134P protein will have changed an intrasubunit hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonds, and intersubunit interactions. H-L134P ferritin assembled from 24 subunits will have eight regions of local flexibility distributed symmetrically around the surface of the molecule caused by the changes at each junction of three subunits (Fig. 3). In other proteins, introduction of proline into a peptide can be without functional effect (26Sauer U.H. San D.P. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2393-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the proteins adjusting conformation to accommodate the change (26Sauer U.H. San D.P. Matthews B.W. J. Biol.

Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). However, in ferritin, the effect of the proline substitution is amplified by disrupting both cooperative interhelical and intersubunit interactions (Fig. 3). The unfolded structure at the 3-fold axes can alter the behavior of assembled ferritin H-L134P in solution. For example, the flexibility of the structure will propagate to the channels for iron entry; the mutation led to a shift in the absorbance maximum of the initial Fe(III) complex (Fig. 1), a decreased rate of oxidation (13Fetter J. Cohen J. Danger D. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 652-661Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and a decreased decay rate of the initial Fe(III) complex that fortuitously permitted its identification as Fe(III)-tyrosine (12Waldo G.S. Ling J. Sanders-Loehr J. Theil E.C. Science. 1993; 259: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Whether Fe(III)-tyrosine is specific to H-L134P ferritin protein or simply more readily detected in H-L134P protein because of the slower decay is not yet clear (see Ref. 3Pereira A.S. Tavares P.

Disorder at the 3-fold axis of the assembled H-L134P protein appeared to increase the accessibility of the mineral core to solutes such as reductants and chelators (Fig. 2).

The assembly of H-L134P ferritin subunits into the typical supramolecular ferritin structure, except at the subunit trimer junctions, emphasizes the contributions of the subunit dimer and tetramer interactions to the structure (1Waldo G.S.

This interaction, which is critical for proper T-cell function, is mediated by the N-terminal unique region of Lck and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the coreceptors. A pair of cysteines on each molecule is essential for association, suggesting that CD4 or CD8 may interact with Lck by jointly coordinating a metal ion. We describe here experiments in which a maltose-binding protein fusion protein bearing the CD4 tail has been coexpressed inEscherichia coli with an N-terminal fragment of Lck. The proteins associate in the expressing cells, forming a complex that can be affinity-purified. Formation of this complex, like the in vivo interaction, depends upon the two pairs of cysteines. Biochemical and biophysical experiments show that the complex dissociates in the presence of EDTA and that it contains a single Zn2+ ion. These results are consistent with the proposal that Lck and CD4 associate by thiol-mediated co-coordination of zinc.

Lck is a Src family PTK found primarily in T-cells, and it is recruited to the activated T-cell receptor via its association with the cytoplasmic domain of the CD4 or CD8 coreceptors (4Veillette A.

Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Each family member has a unique N-terminal domain, which lacks the homology prevalent in the rest of the protein. The role of the unique domain remains unclear for most proteins in the superfamily, but in the case of Lck it has been shown to mediate association with the T-cell surface coreceptors CD4 and CD8 (20Turner J.M.

This association is essential for normal T-cell function (8Glaichenhaus N. Shastri N. Littman D.R. Turner J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis of deletion mutants in cell culture has shown that the cytoplasmic tail of either CD4 or CD8α (Lck binds the α variant only) and the first 32 residues of the Lck unique region are sufficient for in vivo association (21Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E. Hammond C. Stern D.F. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The interaction mediated by these regions appears to be quite specific. When the extracellular and transmembrane domains of platelet-derived growth factor receptor are fused to the cytoplasmic domain of CD4, the fusion protein complexes with Lck and transduces signals through it (25Adam D. Klages S. Bishop P. Mahajan S. Escobedo J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19882-19888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, when the regulatory and kinase domains of p60src are joined to the unique region of Lck, CD4 activation produces Src kinase activity (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Analysis of point mutations has demonstrated that the coreceptor-Lck interaction is mediated by cysteine residues. More specifically, the sequence CXCP in the cytoplasmic tails of both CD4 and CD8α appears to interact with the sequence CXXC in the N-terminal domain of Lck. When these cysteines are mutated to alanine, serine, or even histidine, the complex, which is detectable by immunoprecipitation in wild type cells, does not form (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 22Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This evidence has been corroborated by antibody induced capping and immunofluorescence microscopy of the CD4·Lck and CD8·Lck complexes in vivo(26Gassmann M. Amrein K.E. Burn P. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Kwan Lim G.E. McNeill L. Whitley K. Becker D.L. Zamoyska R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Lck appears to be the only Src-related PTK that utilizes cysteines to bind surface receptors.There are at least three known cysteine-mediated receptor/kinase interactions, and all of them involve Lck. CD4 and CD8α represent two of these. In addition, 4–1BB, a T-cell-specific antigen whose structure resembles members of the nerve growth factor superfamily, also bears a CXCP motif and interacts with Lck (28Kim Y.J. Pollok K.E. Zhou Z. Shaw A. Bohlen J.B. Fraser M. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1255-1262PubMed Google Scholar). The dependence of these non-covalent interactions on four cysteines suggests that receptor and kinase may be held together by a metal ion coordinated by thiol groups from both molecules. This notion is supported by the observation that 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline, a metal chelator, disrupts in vitro reconstitution of a CD4·Lck complex from detergent lysates (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Metal-mediated association has been previously demonstrated with the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein, which has been shown to form zinc- and cadmium-linked homodimers (29Frankel A.D. Bredt D.S. Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 240: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). A direct demonstration of the participation of a metal ion has hitherto been lacking, however. This paper describes experiments in which fragments of the two proteins have been coexpressed as distinct fusion proteins in bacteria and their complex purified. The 1:1 complex of MBP-CD4-(396–433) and Lck-(7–226) that we can isolate is cysteine-dependent and EDTA-sensitive, and it contains one equivalent of Zn2+. These results are consistent with the model that the association is mediated by a co-coordinated zinc ion.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONVarious portions of CD4 and Lck were coexpressed in bacteria. Fragments encompassing the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 were expressed as fusion proteins with MBP, chosen because it is monomeric. Five CD4 fusion proteins were expressed, two with wild type CD4 sequences and three with mutations (Fig. 1 A). The larger of the wild type constructs (CD4L) include almost the entire C-terminal tail (residues 396–433); the smaller (CD4S) was seven residues shorter, beginning after the N-terminal stretch of arginines. In the three mutant constructs, alanines were substituted for Cys-420 and Cys-422, the cysteines shown previously to be critical for association (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 22Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The double mutant (CD4m1+2) and both single mutants (CD4m1, CD4m2) were made. All constructs were well expressed. They appeared as ∼48-kDa bands on SDS gels (Fig. 2, indicated bands), but the presence of fragments shorter than the full-length induced band suggested some degree of proteolytic degradation or premature termination. Coexpression of the MBP CD4 fusion proteins with Lck had no effect on this distribution of bands.Figure 2CD4·Lck copurification experiments.Coelution from phosphotyrosine affinity columns was used to assay for protein:protein interaction. Samples from the crude soluble extract (S), the column flow-through (ft), the column wash, and the elution were subjected to SDS-PAGE along with known molecular weight standards (M). A, CD4L·LckN32;B, CD4S·LckN32; C, CD4L·Lck32; D, CD4m1·LckN32; E, CD4m2·LckN32; F, CD4m1+2·LckN32. Bands representing the CD4 and Lck fusion proteins involved in each experiment are indicated. The high molecular weight bands seen in most of the phosphotyrosine elutions shown are bacterial proteins that purify by ion exchange. These proteins can be separated from CD4L·LckN32 complex by subsequent gel filtration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Two Lck fragments were coexpressed with the MBP-CD4 fusion proteins, LckN32 and Lck32 (Fig. 1 B). LckN32 (residues 7–226) includes the unique region, the SH3 domain, and the SH2 domain of Lck, while Lck32 (residues 53–226) bears the SH3 and SH2 domains, but lacks the unique region (Fig. 2, indicated bands). The presence of an SH2 domain in both fragments provides for simple, one step purification by phosphotyrosine affinity chromatography. The Lck32 fragment, like the CD4m fusions, was used in coexpression experiments as a control for any nonspecific interaction.The expressed CD4 fusion proteins and Lck fragments are all soluble, fractionating in the supernatant portion of the cell lysate after ultracentrifugation. As an assay for CD4·Lck association, soluble fractions from all coexpression strains (CD4L·LckN32, CD4S·LckN32, CD4m1·LckN32, CD4m2· LckN32, CD4m1+2·LckN32, CD4L·Lck32) were subjected to phosphotyrosine affinity chromatography. If the two proteins are associated, they will both appear to bind to the column and will elute together. Conversely, if they are not associated, the CD4 fusion protein will not be retained and will not coelute with Lck. The results from these experiments are shown in Fig. 2. Significant coelution was observed only when CD4L was coexpressed with LckN32 (Fig. 2 A). We concluded that this was the result of protein-protein association, as CD4L was not retained by phosphotyrosine columns when expressed by itself (data not shown). Only full-length CD4L (the highest induced band) associates with LckN32, consistent with the assumption that the other induced bands are CD4 tail truncations of some sort. When LckN32 and MBP-CD4L are separately expressed and purified, they co-purify on phosphotyrosine-Sepharose when mixed in the presence, but not absence of zinc (data not shown).All three of the cysteine mutant fusions failed to coelute with LckN32 (Fig. 2, D–F), and CD4L did not coelute with Lck32 (Fig. 2 C). These results show that the interaction observed in the CD4L·LckN32 coexpression experiments depend upon the N-terminal unique region of Lck and upon cysteines 420 and 422 in the CD4 tail. These are the same as the requirements demonstrated in vivo (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 21Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E. Hammond C. Stern D.F. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the interaction between CD4L and LckN32 indeed corresponds to the native CD4·Lck association, and that it is not an artifact of expression in E. coli.The CD4S also copurified with LckN32 (Fig. 2 B), but not as strongly. This observation suggests that the N-terminal arginine-rich segment lacking in CD4S but present in CD4L (residues 396–402) may be necessary for proper association. Indeed, a somewhat larger deletion, encompassing residues 395–412 in murine CD4 (397–414 in humans) abolishes interaction with Lck in cell culture (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), consistent with the importance of the membrane-proximal region for stable interaction.Large quantities of CD4L·LckN32 complex were purified using phosphotyrosine affinity chromatography (see also “Experimental Procedures”) and concentrated to between 20 and 30 mg/ml. When CD4L·LckN32 complex prepared in this manner was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 sizing column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the sample eluted in two primary peaks (Fig. 3 A): a large peak at 13.8 ml, followed by a smaller peak at 16 ml (the peak observed at 8.5 ml is aggregated protein and contains neither CD4L nor LckN32). SDS-PAGE of this elution pattern (Fig. 3 A) revealed that the first peak contained CD4L and LckN32 in roughly 1:1 stoichiometry. The smaller second peak contained unbound, monomeric LckN32. When the gel filtered complex was diluted and reapplied to the sizing column, it eluted in a single peak at 14.1 ml, indicating that the association is relatively stable (Fig. 3 B). Comparison of elution volumes of the complex with those of known standards sets its molecular mass at ∼90 kDa, 17 kDa higher than the expected mass of a 1:1 CD4L·LckN32 complex. This effective mass could reflect either an extended structure or some tendency to form higher aggregates.Figure 3Gel filtration of the CD4L·LckN32 complex. A 254 elution profiles are shown along with Coomassie-stained gels that encompass the peaks of interest. CD4L and LckN32 are indicated in both gels. The sample loaded in each experiment (L) and a set of molecular weight standards (M) are also shown. A, concentrated (∼20 mg/ml) CD4L·LckN32 complex taken directly from phosphotyrosine elution and applied to a Superdex 200 sizing column. The two primary peaks contain CD4L·LckN32 complex and unbound LckN32, respectively. The peak at 8.5 ml, which is not shown in the gel, represents aggregates of higher molecular weight protein. B, gel-filtered CD4L·LckN32 complex reapplied to the Superdex 200 column at low concentration (∼1 mg/ml). The primary peak contains CD4L·LckN32 complex, with a small shoulder containing unbound LckN32. The molecular mass of the CD4L·LckN32 complex was approximated using the following standards: dimeric transferrin receptor (140 kDa, 13.2 ml), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, 14.6 ml), and ovalbumin (44 kDa, 15.6 ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CD4L·LckN32 complex purified by phosphotyrosine affinity and gel filtration yielded a single major band when subjected to native PAGE (Fig. 4, lane 2). The band was identified as a 1:1 CD4L·LckN32 complex by experiments in which it was excised from the gel and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Preincubation with 0.5 mm EDTA led to complete dissociation of the complex and appearance of two new bands (Fig. 4, lane 3). SDS-PAGE analysis identifies the higher mobility band as unbound LckN32 and the lower as CD4L (data not shown). By contrast, neither 1% β-ME nor 25 mm dithiothreitol affects the complex (lanes 4 and 5, respectively). The zinc chelator 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline also disrupts the CD4L·LckN32 association, but much less efficiently than does EDTA (approximately 50% dissociation at 14 mm1,10-ortho-phenanthroline, data not shown). These variations in chelator effectiveness probably reflect the structural intricacies of the interaction itself.Figure 4Coomassie-stained native PAGE of free LckN32 and the CD4L·LckN32 complex. Samples were incubated in buffers containing the indicated reagent and then subjected to electrophoresis at pH 8.8 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Two samples of complex from separate bacterial preparations were purified by phosphotyrosine affinity chromatography and gel filtration. ICP spectroscopy was then used to determine the concentration of 25 separate metal ions relative to blanks taken from the same purifications. Zinc was the only metal to appear at levels above background in the CD4L·LckN32 samples (TableI). The protein concentration in both samples was determined by absolute amino acid analysis, and the number of zinc atoms per complex was calculated to be 0.90 for sample 1 and 1.05 for sample 2. As a control, a sample of MBP lacking a CD4 cytoplasmic tail was also subjected to ICP analysis, which gave only background levels of zinc (data not shown). Taken together with the published mutational studies and with our native gel experiments, these compositional data strongly support a model in which CD4 and Lck associate by cysteine-mediated co-coordination of a zinc ion (Fig. 5). Zinc is a common structural element in small domains of intracellular proteins (e.g. zinc fingers), but this role as a cross-linker represents a novel type of interaction.Table ICD4L · LckN32 zinc analysisSample 1Sample 2Zinc (sample/background, ppb)1931/19.801772/49.50Zinc (μm)0.2920.263Protein (mg/ml)2.351.82Protein (μm)0.3240.251Zinc complex0.901.05The ICP-determined zinc concentration (in ppb) is displayed along with the background zinc level for that sample. Background levels of zinc were determined using sample buffer blanks taken from the same purifications. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by amino acid analysis. The micromolar concentrations of both protein and zinc were calculated assuming a molecular weight of 65.38 amu for zinc and 72.5 × 103 amu for the protein (where amu is atomic mass units), which was taken to be 100% CD4L · LckN32 in a 1:1 stoichiometric complex. The density of the sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% β-ME, 2 mm benzamidine) was assumed to be 1.0 g/ml.

Anderson P. Morimoto C. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Immunol. Rev. 1989; 111: 223-266Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CD4 and Lck interact when expressed in non-lymphoid cell lines as well (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R.

Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), indicating that T-cell-specific factors are not required in order for the complex to form. Other experiments have demonstrated that myristylation and membrane localization of Lck is not strictly required for interaction with CD4 (22Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, radioactive pulse-chase studies have indicated that the proteins may associate while CD4 is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum, long before the coreceptor is transported to the cell membrane (21Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E. Hammond C. Stern D.F. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the CD4-p56lck interaction is both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable under physiological conditions. The results presented here support this hypothesis. CD4L and LckN32 apparently associate in bacterial cells, in the absence of myristylation, T-cell-specific proteins, and eukaryotic organelles. Moreover, gel filtration analysis of the purified complex indicates that there is little, if any, reversible equilibrium between bound and unbound states.We can compare the CD4L·LckN32 association with what is known about the CD8α-p56lck association. The cytoplasmic tails of both CD4 and CD8α are shown in Fig. 6. The tail of CD8α is 10 residues shorter than that of CD4, and the CXCP motif is much closer to the membrane (8 residues away as opposed to 25). When the sequence TCQCPHR from CD4 and the sequence VCKCPR from CD8α were fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the viral transmembrane protein VSV-G (fusion proteins G4 andG8 in Fig. 6), the G8 fusion interacted with Lck, but the G4 fusion did not (22Shaw A.S.

In another experiment, a murine CD4 mutant (CD4-Δ412) was constructed in which residues 395–412 (397–414 in humans) were deleted (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This deletion decreased the distance between the membrane and the CXCP motif to seven residues, just as in wild type CD8α. The mutant also failed to interact with Lck. Thus, CD4 seems to have additional sequence requirements beyond the CXCP motif, whereas CD8α does not.Figure 6Comparison of the cytoplasmic regions of CD4 and CD8α, and their interactions with Lck. A deletion of 18 residues in the arginine-rich region of the CD4 tail disrupts its interaction with Lck (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), and a VSV-G fusion protein with the seven-residue CD4 sequence TCQCPHR does not interact with Lck (22Shaw A.S.

In contrast, a VSV-G fusion protein with corresponding region of CD8α does bind Lck (22Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell.

See “Results and Discussion” for further discussion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This conclusion is consistent with the coexpression and copurification data presented here. The CXCP motif is not enough to promote strong CD4·LckN32 association in bacteria; the arginine-rich segment (residues 396–402), is also required. Further experiments will be required to determine if this sequence is functionally involved in the interaction, or if it is simply acting as a spacer to reduce the steric hindrance imposed by MBP. That the G4 fusion and the CD4-Δ412 mutant, which lack the arginine-rich stretch, both fail to associate with Lck suggests that this segment may indeed be significant (20Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H.

CD8α also bears an N-terminal arginine-rich sequence (residues 189–193), but mutational studies in cell culture have shown that it is not required for association.

We cloned its cDNA from a rat brain cDNA library and characterized it. p105 was a protein of 766 amino acids and showed a calculated M r of 86,449. p105 consisted of one F-actin-binding domain at the N-terminal region, one Dbl homology domain and one pleckstrin homology domain at the middle region, and one cysteine-rich domain at the C-terminal region. This domain organization of p105 was similar to that of FGD1, which has been determined to be the genetic locus responsible for faciogenital dysplasia or Aarskog-Scott syndrome. We therefore named p105 frabin (FGD1-related F-actin-binding protein). Frabin bound along the sides of F-actin and showed F-actin-cross-linking activity. Overexpression of frabin in Swiss 3T3 cells and COS7 cells induced cell shape change and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, respectively, as described for FGD1.

Because FGD1 has been shown to serve as a GDP/GTP exchange protein for Cdc42 small G protein, it is likely that frabin is a direct linker between Cdc42 and the actin cytoskeleton. Dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for many cell functions, including cell shape change, adhesion, and motility (for reviews see Refs. 1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev.

Evidence is accumulating that the Rho family small G proteins are important regulators of these actin-dependent cell functions (for reviews see Refs. 4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H.

The Rho family is divided into three subfamilies: the Cdc42, Rac, and Rho subfamilies (Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, respectively). In fibroblasts, Cdc42 induces filopodium formation; Rac induces lamellipodium and membrane ruffle formation: and Rho regulates assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions. In addition to these functions, the Rho family members are involved in the regulation of cell growth: Cdc42 and Rac, but not Rho, induce mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated JNK 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GEP, GDP/GTP exchange protein; DH, Dbl homology; aa, amino acid(s); PH, pleckstrin homology; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; S1, subfragment 1. activation (6Coso O.A.

The conversion from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form is stimulated by a GEP. Many GEPs for the Rho family members have thus far been identified and shown to share two conserved domains: a DH domain of about 250 aa and a PH domain of about 100 aa. The majority of the GEPs have been isolated as oncogenes (4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem.

Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215990) Google Scholar). Fetal brains from 420 mother rats (17-day gestation) were homogenized with a solution containing 10 mm Tris/Cl at pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A). The homogenate was mildly stirred for 1 h and centrifuged at 200,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C until use. One-seventh of the supernatant (515 ml, 1.9 g of protein) was applied on a Q-Sepharose FF column (2.6 × 34 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mmTris/Cl at pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Elution was performed with a 800-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m) in Buffer A. Fractions of 10 ml each were collected. Frabin appeared in Fractions 35–55. These fractions (210 ml, 300 mg of protein) were collected. Half of the sample was diluted with a 2-fold volume of Buffer A and applied on a Mono Q HR 10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A. Elution was performed with a 48-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.3 m) in Buffer A, followed by 34 ml of Buffer A containing 1 mNaCl. Fractions of 2 ml each were collected. Frabin appeared in Fractions 20–22. These fractions (6 ml, 19 mg of protein) were collected. The other half of the sample of the Q-Sepharose FF column chromatography was also subjected to the Mono Q column chromatography in the same manner as described above. The active fractions of the two Mono Q column chromatographies were combined, and solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to give a final concentration of 20% saturation. The sample was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was applied on a TSKgel phenyl-5PW column (2.15 × 15 cm, Tosoh) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.9 m(NH4)2SO4. Elution was performed with a 210-ml linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (0.9–0 m) in Buffer A, followed by 80 ml of Buffer A. Fractions of 4 ml each were collected. Frabin appeared in Fractions 18–21. These fractions (16 ml, 6.3 mg of protein) were collected and applied on a TSKgel phenyl-5PW RP column (0.75 × 7.5 cm, Tosoh) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with a 88-ml linear gradient of acetonitrile (20–52.5%) in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by 27 ml of 100% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions of 2.7 ml each were collected. Frabin appeared in Fraction 23 (see Fig. 1). This fraction (2.7 ml, 54 μg of protein) was collected. The rest of the supernatant fraction from the brain homogenate was also subjected to the successive column chromatographies in the same manner as described above. The active fractions of the seven pheny-5PW RP column chromatographies were combined, lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C. The purified phenyl-5PW RP sample (300 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel). The protein band corresponding to a protein with a M r of about 105,000 was processed as described (11Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The aa sequences of the peptides derived from the protein band were determined with a peptide sequencer. A rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) was screened using the oligonucleotide probes designed from the partial aa sequences. Assay for JNK activity was done as described (16Moriguchi T.

Briefly, pSRα-HA-JNKα was transfected with pCMV-Myc-full-length frabin, pEF-BOS-Myc-V12Cdc42 (17Komuro R. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Orita S. Takai Y.

After incubation for 16 h in serum-starved Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. Each immunoprecipitate was then washed and used for assay with GST-c-Jun as a substrate. Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The subconfluent cells were serum-starved for 24 h before microinjection. pCMV-Myc-full-length frabin or pEF-BOS-Myc-V12Cdc42 (0.05 mg/ml each) was then microinjected into the nuclei of the cells, and 18 h later the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy as described (11Nakanishi H.

During the purification of lafadin from rat brain using a blot overlay method with 125I-labeled F-actin (13Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), we detected another protein band of 125I-labeled F-actin binding activity with a M r of about 105,000. We purified it by chromatographies of Q-Sepharose, Mono Q, phenyl-5PW, and phenyl-5PW RP columns. On the final phenyl-5PW RP column chromatography, the 125I-labeled F-actin-binding protein band coincided well with a protein with a M r of about 105,000 (p105), which was identified by protein staining (Fig. 1). We determined the partial aa sequences of p105. The aa sequences of p105 were not found in current protein data base. On the basis of this information, we isolated a p105 cDNA from a rat brain cDNA library and determined its nucleotide sequence. The encoded protein consisted of 766 aa and showed a calculated M rof 86,449 (GenBankTM accession number AF038388) (Fig. 2 A). ThisM r value was less than that estimated by SDS-PAGE. To confirm whether this clone contained a full-length cDNA of p105, we constructed the eukaryotic expression vector with this cDNA and expressed the protein in COS7 cells. The expressed protein showed the mobility similar to that of native p105 on SDS-PAGE and had the 125I-labeled F-actin binding activity (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, we concluded that this clone encoded the full-length cDNA of p105. By use of fusion proteins of several truncated forms of p105 with GST, we determined the minimum 125I-labeled F-actin-binding domain to be aa 1–150 (Fig. 2 C). Computer homology search revealed that the aa sequence of this domain showed no significant homology to any protein in current protein data base. However, the aa sequence following the F-actin-binding domain showed a significant homology to that of FGD1 (Fig. 2 D). p105 had one DH domain and one PH domain the aa sequences of which showed 71% and 57% identity to those of FGD1, respectively. p105 also had one cysteine-rich domain the aa sequence of which showed 65% identity to that of FGD1. We therefore named p105 frabin. When GST-full-length frabin was incubated with F-actin followed by ultracentrifugation, the fusion protein was recovered with F-actin in the pellet (Fig. 3 A). The stoichiometry of the binding of GST-frabin to actin was 1 GST-frabin molecule/∼14 actin molecules. The K d value was about 9 × 10−7m. Similar results were obtained with GST-frabin-1 (aa 1–150) and GST-frabin-2 (aa 1–208) (data not shown). The binding of native frabin to125I-labeled F-actin was inhibited by an excessive amount of myosin S1, a protein that binds along the sides of F-actin (19Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 20Schröder R.R. Manstein D.J. Jahn W. Holden H. Rayment I. Holmes K.C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). This inhibition was reversed by the addition of MgATP because MgATP dissociates the actin-myosin complex (21Fraser A.B. Eisenberg E. Kielley W.W. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicating that frabin bound along the sides of F-actin. The F-actin-cross-linking activity of GST-full-length frabin and GST-frabin-1 (aa 1–150) was examined by transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens. GST-full-length frabin caused F-actin to associate into bundles, whereas GST-frabin-1 or GST alone did not (Fig. 3 C). The α-actinin/spectrin family members have most extensively been studied as F-actin-binding proteins having F-actin-cross-linking activity (22Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Matsudaira P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). They usually form oligomers and thereby show the F-actin-cross-linking activity. When frabin was subjected to gel filtration, it appeared at a position corresponding to aM r of about 250,000 (data not shown). Because the M r values of frabin estimated by SDS-PAGE and calculated from its predicted aa sequence were about 105,000 and 86,000, respectively, these results suggest that frabin forms an oligomer with multiple F-actin-binding heads and thereby shows the F-actin-cross-linking activity. To further obtain the evidence that frabin is an F-actin-binding protein, we expressed Myc-tagged full-length frabin or a Myc-tagged mutant, which lacked the F-actin-binding domain, in COS7 cells and compared the localization of each expressed protein with that of endogenous F-actin. Frabin having the F-actin-binding domain was colocalized with F-actin, but frabin lacking the domain was not (Fig. 3 D). On the basis of these observations, we have concluded that frabin serves as an F-actin-binding protein in intact cells and that the F-actin-binding domain is located at the N-terminal region (aa 1–150). Of the activities of FGD1 thus far reported (10Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33169-33172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we examined whether frabin is also capable of changing cell shape and activating JNK. When frabin or a dominant active mutant of Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) was expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells, they similarly induced cell shape change characterized by microspike formation (Fig. 4). Although we did not determine whether the microspikes were filopodia or retraction fibers, the former is likely because Cdc42 has been shown to induce filopodium formation (24Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar). Frabin or V12Cdc42 was expressed in COS7 cells together with HA-tagged JNK. The JNK was immunoprecipitated, and its kinase activity toward GST-c-Jun was determined. Frabin as well as V12Cdc42 similarly induced JNK activation (Fig. 5). These results indicate that frabin shows at least the two activities similar to those of FGD1. We have not determined here whether frabin shows GEP activity to Cdc42. However, because the DH and PH domains of frabin are highly homologous to those of FGD1, it is likely that frabin serves as a GEP for Cdc42 and induces cell shape change and JNK activation through Cdc42 activation as described for FGD1 (10Zheng Y.

HA-tagged JNK was expressed in COS7 cells along with Myc-full-length frabin, Myc-V12Cdc42, or Myc-Dbl and then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody.

The aa sequences of the DH, PH, and cysteine-rich domains are well conserved between frabin and FGD1, but the nucleotide sequence differences were not clustered but distributed throughout the sequences. Therefore, although we have not determined the genetic locus of frabin, it is likely that frabin is not a splicing variant but an isoform of FGD1 derived from a different gene. The aa sequence of the N-terminal region of frabin, which is responsible for the F-actin binding activity, is not conserved in FGD1, and it remains unknown whether the N-terminal proline-rich domain of FGD1 binds to F-actin. The physiological significance of frabin binding to F-actin and showing activities similar to those of FGD1 has not been clarified here, but there are two possible roles of the F-actin binding activity of frabin: one is to be involved in Cdc42 activation, and the other is to be involved in Cdc42 action. It has been shown that a GEP specific for Rac, Tiam1, is localized at the membrane through its N-terminal PH domain, but not its PH domain adjacent to the DH domain, and that this domain is required for the Rac-induced membrane ruffling and JNK activation (25Michiels F.

On the basis of these observations, it has been suggested that the localization of Tiam1 at the membrane is an important factor for Rac activation (25Michiels F. Stam J.C.

By analogy, it is possible that the localization of frabin at the actin cytoskeleton through its F-actin-binding domain is important for Cdc42 activation. Mutations to the FGD1 gene, either by interruption of the gene by chromosomal translocation or by insertion of a single base pair causing premature translational termination within the DH domain, have been detected in faciogenital dysplasia or Aarskog-Scott syndrome (9Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Mutations to the frabin gene may also cause multisystemic developmental diseases including faciogenital dysplasia. Further studies are necessary to understand the physiological and pathological roles of frabin. We thank Dr. E.

https://openalex.org/W2091247632,"The activation of protein kinase B/Akt is thought to be a critical step in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway that regulates cell growth and differentiation. Because insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulates the resumption of meiosis in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes via phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation, we investigated the Akt involvement in this process. Injection of mRNA coding for a constitutively active Akt in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes induced germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) to the same extent as progesterone or insulin treatment. Injection of mRNA coding for the wild type Akt kinase was less effective in stimulating GVBD, whereas Akt bearing a lysine mutation in the catalytic domain that abolishes the kinase activity had no effect. A mutant Akt lacking a membrane-targeting sequence did not induce GVBD, despite high levels of expression and activity. As previously reported for insulin, induction of GVBD by Akt was prevented by incubating the oocytes with cilostamide, an inhibitor specific for the type 3 phosphodiesterase (PDE3), suggesting that the activity of a PDE is required for Akt action. That an increase in PDE activity in the oocyte is sufficient to induce meiotic resumption was demonstrated by expression of an active PDE protein. In addition, the constitutively active Akt caused a 2-fold increase in the activity of the endogenous PDE. These data demonstrate that Akt is in the pathway controlling resumption of meiosis in the<i>Xenopus</i> oocyte and that regulation of the activity of a PDE3 is a step distal to the kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2051433813,"During RNA synthesis in the ternary elongation complex, RNA polymerase enzyme holds nucleic acids in three contiguous sites: the double-stranded DNA-binding site (DBS) ahead of the transcription bubble, the RNA-DNA heteroduplex-binding site (HBS), and the RNA-binding site (RBS) upstream of HBS. Photochemical cross-linking allowed mapping of the DNA and RNA contacts to specific positions on the amino acid sequence. Unexpectedly, the same protein regions were found to participate in both DBS and RBS. Thus, DNA entry and RNA exit occur close together in the RNA polymerase molecule, suggesting that the three sites constitute a single unit. The results explain how RNA in the integrated unit RBS–HBS–DBS may stabilize the ternary complex, whereas a hairpin in RNA result in its dissociation."

We investigated the effect of direct cell-cell contact between peripheral blood T lymphocytes or HUT-78 lymphoma cells and dermal fibroblasts or synoviocytes on the deposition of the major extracellular matrix components: types I and III collagen. Incubation of dermal fibroblasts and synoviocytes with plasma membrane preparations from resting T cells slightly increased the production of collagen I but did not significantly affect that of collagen III. Conversely, direct contact with either plasma membranes or fixed phytohemagglutinin/phorbol myristate acetate-activated T cells markedly inhibited the synthesis of types I and III collagen by 60–70% in untreated dermal fibroblasts and synoviocytes and by 85% in transforming growth factor β-stimulated fibroblasts. This decrease of collagen synthesis was abrogated when fixed T cells were separated physically from fibroblasts, demonstrating that direct contact between the two cell types was necessary. This inhibition was associated with a marked decrease in steady-state levels of pro-α1(I) and pro-α1(III) collagen mRNAs. T cell contact decreased the transcription rate but did not significantly alter the stability of the α1(I) and α1(III) transcripts.

Regulation of connective tissue metabolism is an important event in a number of biological and pathophysiological processes such as embryonic organomorphogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, tissue destruction, fibrosis, tumor invasion, and metastasis.

In contrast to these well documented fibroblast-ECM interactions, little information is available concerning the role of cell-cell contact in the regulation of ECM deposition. Previous in vitro studies suggest that the interaction between inflammatory cells and fibroblasts can modulate several fibroblast functions including collagen production (33Goldring S.R. Dayer J.M. Krane S.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1981; 24: S106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Hibbs M.S. Postlethwaite A.E. Mainardi C.L. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. J. Exp.

Nor do they take into account the respective role of soluble factors released by mononuclear cells and those requiring direct cell-cell contact in the mediation of this phenomenon.The aim of the present study was to shed light on the regulation of ECM deposition, mainly types I and III collagen, operated by direct cell-cell interaction between inflammatory cells, namely T lymphocytes or for convenience and standardization the HUT-78 T lymphoma cell line, and mesenchymal cells such as dermal fibroblasts and synoviocytes.We provide evidence that the physical interaction between PHA/PMA-activated T cells and dermal fibroblasts or synoviocytes reduces markedly the production of both types I and III collagen by these cells. We also demonstrate that this inhibition is regulated at the transcriptional level and that it is mainly due to an additive effect of T cell-associated IFN-γ, TNFα, and IL-1α.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we investigated the effect of direct cell-cell interactions on the production of types I and III collagen by human dermal fibroblasts and synoviocytes. We demonstrate that co-culturing fixed PHA/PMA-activated PBTL or HUT-78 lymphoma cells with dermal fibroblasts or synoviocytes results in a marked decrease in the basal production of types I and III collagen. In contrast, contact with unstimulated fixed T cells slightly increased the production of collagen I while that of collagen III was not significantly affected. These results suggest that cell-cell contact modulates connective tissue metabolism. However, it is well established that soluble factors may be released by fixed T cells. Thus, authors have shown that significant levels of TNFα (4–234 pg/ml) can be detected in culture supernatants from fixed T cells (48Sebbag M. Parry S.L. Brennan F.M. Feldmann M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To rule out the possible involvement of signals generated by both cell-cell contact and soluble factors in the regulation of collagen synthesis, experiments were set up first using plasma membrane preparations from unstimulated or activated T cells, and then in double-chamber culture systems. Results showed that contact-mediated signals are responsible for the inhibitory action of activated T cells on the production of collagen I and III, while diffusing mediators released from unstimulated T cells slightly up-regulate collagen I synthesis.Using specific neutralizing antibody we identified TGFβ as the diffusing factor responsible for the increase in collagen I production mediated by unstimulated T cell membranes or fixed cells (not shown). This could explain why collagen III production is not up-regulated by incubation with resting T cells since in this system production of type III collagen appeared less sensitive to TGFβ than did that of collagen I.In vitro studies revealed that human T cells have the ability to adhere to synoviocytes as well as to dermal fibroblasts via CD2/CD58 (LFA-3) and LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18)/CD54 (ICAM-1) interactions (12Haynes B.F.

Olsen I. Black C. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cellular adhesion between T cells and synoviocytes induces the production of IL-1β by synovial cells in part through LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction (17Nakatsuka K. Tanaka Y. Hubscher S. Abe M. Wake A. Saito K. Morimoto I. Eto S. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 458-464PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the putative implication of these adhesion molecules in the inhibition of collagen I production mediated by contact with activated T cells was investigated. In the presence of blocking mAbs raised against CD2, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD40, CD54, CD58, and CD106, the decrease of collagen I production was not reversed (data not shown), thus ruling out the involvement of these surface molecules in the mediation of cell-contact mediated inhibition of collagen synthesis.Next, we investigated the implication of cell-associated cytokines on the inhibition of collagen deposition. Several cytokines are known to decrease in vitro the production of collagen I by fibroblasts i.e. IFN-γ, TNFα, and in some cases IL-1α and IL-1β (29Diaz A. Munoz E. Johnston R. Korn J.H. Jimenez S.A.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used antibodies or cytokine inhibitors for these cytokines and demonstrate that the concomitant neutralization of IFN-γ, TNFα, and IL-1 results in a marked reversion of the inhibition of collagen I production amounting to 81 and 66.7% in dermal fibroblasts cultured with activated PBTL and HUT-78 cells, respectively. Thus, the inhibition of collagen production seems to be mainly due to activated T cell-associated cytokines including IL-1α, IFN-γ, and the transmembrane form of TNFα. However, since cytokine blocking agents did not prompt the complete reversion of collagen down-regulation, particularly in the case of activated HUT-78 cells, we propose that other still unidentified cell-surface molecules might be implicated in this inhibitory effect. Besides, since IL-1α was only detected in the membrane preparations of activated PBTL and not in those of HUT-78 cells, we cannot rule out the possible implication of a cytokine autocrine loop produced by fibroblasts following contact with activated PBTL or HUT-78 cell membranes. Indeed, co-cultures of T cells and dermal fibroblasts or synoviocytes have been reported to stimulate the production of IL-1β by fibroblasts (16Spörri B. Bickel M. Limat A. Wealti E.R. Hunziker T. Wiesmann U.N. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Nakatsuka K. Tanaka Y. Hubscher S. Abe M. Wake A. Saito K. Morimoto I. Eto S. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 458-464PubMed Google Scholar), and Bombara et al. (14Bombara M.P. Webb D.L. Conrad P. Marlor C.W. Sarr T. Ranges G.E. Aune T.M. Greve J.M. Blue M.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have reported that co-culturing T cells and synovial fibroblasts results in the accumulation of cytokines in the culture supernatant, notably of IFN-γ and TNFα (14Bombara M.P. Webb D.L. Conrad P. Marlor C.W. Sarr T. Ranges G.E. Aune T.M. Greve J.M. Blue M.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, according to RNase protection assay analysis, in our system mRNAs encoding for IFN-γ and TNFα were not expressed in dermal fibroblasts or synoviocytes incubated with membranes of activated T cells (not shown). These data confirm that inhibition of collagen production mediated by IFN-γ and TNFα is due to membrane associated forms of these cytokines.The involvement of membrane-associated cytokines in the down-regulation of collagen deposition is consistent with the time course of induction by PHA/PMA of the ability of PBTL to inhibit the production of collagen. Indeed, TNFα which is the best characterized membrane-associated cytokine, was shown to be expressed on the surface of CD4+ T cell clones within 2 h after activation (51Aversa G. Punnonen J. de Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Previous reports have shown that soluble IFN-γ and TNFα inhibit collagen synthesis both by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (28Kähäri V.M. Chen Y.Q. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 56Diaz A. Jimenez S.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1997; 29: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that contact-mediated decrease of types I and III collagen takes place exclusively at the transcriptional level. Indeed, we provide evidence that no post-transcriptional modifications likely to destabilize pro-α1(I) and pro-α1(III) mRNAs take place. Furthermore, this inhibition was specific for collagen genes since the expression of mRNA coding for MMP-1 was up-regulated during T cell-fibroblast interaction. However, the inhibition of types I and III collagen probably involves distinct molecular mechanisms. Indeed, the decrease of pro-α1(I) mRNA required de novo protein synthesis whereas that of pro-α1(III) did not.Finally, having observed that direct contact with activated T cells induced the production of PGE2 in dermal fibroblasts (18Burger D. Rezzonico R. Li J.M. Modoux C. Pierce R.A. Welgus H.G. Dayer J.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), and PGE2 having proved to inhibit fibroblast collagen synthesis (57Varga J. Diaz-Perez A. Rosenbloom J. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of activated T cell membranes on collagen I production in the presence of indomethacin. The latter, however, did not reduce the decrease of collagen I production mediated by contact with activated T cells (not shown). These data match previous reports on the inhibitory action of soluble IL-1, TNFα, and IFN-γ on collagen I and III accumulation in lung fibroblasts (58Elias J.A. Freundlich B. Adams S. Rosenbloom J. Anal. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consequently, the additive inhibitory effect of cell-associated TNFα, IFN-γ, and IL-1 on collagen I and III production by dermal fibroblasts and synoviocytes takes place at the transcriptional level by a PGE2-independent mechanism.Our observations demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that collagen production might be regulated in vivo by close contact between mesenchymal cells and T lymphocytes. This work also indicates that membrane-associated IFN-γ might be biologically active as already described for surface TNFα. The nature of the binding of IFN-γ to activated T cell membranes is still unclear. However, as proposed by Assenmacher et al. (55Assenmacher M. Scheffold A. Segura Checa J.A. Miltenyi S. Radbruch A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) it would not be IFN-γ bound to IFNγR since surface-bound IFN-γ was detected with several mAbs which block the binding of mouse IFN-γ to its receptor. Further experiments are at present being conducted in our laboratory using CD4+/CD8+ as well as Th1 and Th2 T cell clones activated by an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody to specify the role of membrane-associated IFN-γ in the contact-mediated inhibition of collagen production. Current works are also under progress to study this contact-mediated inhibition of collagen deposition in diffuse systemic scleroderma, a fibrotic disease characterized by abnormal deposition of collagen. In these conditions, the decrease of type I collagen seem to be significantly less pronounced in fibroblasts from systemic scleroderma patients than normal individuals, suggesting that resistance of systemic scleroderma fibroblasts to inhibition might play a pathogenic role in systemic scleroderma (59Chizzolini C. Rezzonico R. Ribbens C. Burger D. Wollheim F.A. Dayer J.-M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, remodeling of ECM occurs in many biological processes and involves the controlled degradation and neosynthesis of collagenous and non-collagenous components. Types I and III collagen are the main constituents of connective tissue and their homeostasis is finely regulated by various signals including soluble factors, cell-matrix, and cell-cell interactions (5Korn J.H. Kelley W.N. Harris E.D.J. Ruddy S. Sledge C.S. Textbook of Rheumatology. Saunders, 1997: 199-208Google Scholar). We have reported that direct contact between activated T cells and dermal fibroblasts or synoviocytes induced an imbalance between the production of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and that of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), favoring matrix catabolism (18Burger D. Rezzonico R. Li J.M. Modoux C. Pierce R.A. Welgus H.G. Dayer J.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that this contact appears to be also capable of favoring ECM degradation by decreasing the level of synthesis of the main collagenous components of ECM, which might reinforce the tissular destruction effect and the lack of repairin vivo. Regulation of connective tissue metabolism is an important event in a number of biological and pathophysiological processes such as embryonic organomorphogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, tissue destruction, fibrosis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells which play a crucial role in the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PBTL, peripheral blood T lymphocytes; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; PINP, procollagen I NH2-terminal propeptide; PIIINP, procollagen III NH2-terminal propeptide; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; CHX, cycloheximide; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FCS, fetal calf serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TGF, transforming growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PBTL, peripheral blood T lymphocytes; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; PINP, procollagen I NH2-terminal propeptide; PIIINP, procollagen III NH2-terminal propeptide; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; CHX, cycloheximide; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FCS, fetal calf serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TGF, transforming growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody.by synthesizing and organizing connective tissue components, predominantly constituted of types I and III fibrillar collagens. Type I collagen is abundant in the skin, tendons, and bones and it is also the main collagen type produced by dermal fibroblasts in culture (1Krane S.M. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H.

Med. 1984; 311: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts respond to various microenvironmental signals including soluble cytokines and growth factors as well as cell-matrix or cell-cell interactions which intervene notably in the control of the balance between synthesis and degradation of ECM (3Postlethwaite A.E. Nickoloff B.J. Dermal Immune System. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 163-184Google Scholar). Alterations in this balance can lead to pathological events such as the invasion of tissue by malignant cells (4Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G. Denhardt D.T.

https://openalex.org/W2129914079,"A primary signaling cascade responsible for the expression of cytokine-stimulated immediate early genes involves the activation of the Jak/Stat pathway. In addition to being tyrosine-phosphorylated, several signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats), including Stat1α, Stat3, and Stat4, are phosphorylated on a conserved serine residue, which is a consensus phosphorylation site for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Serine phosphorylation of Stat1α is required for maximal transcriptional activation of early response genes by interferon γ (IFNγ) as well as the antiviral and antigrowth actions of this cytokine. Incubation of cells with either IFNγ or oncostatin M (OSM) activates Raf-1, a serine/threonine kinase responsible for the ultimate activation of p42 MAPK. To examine whether any of the signaling components that are required for activation of the Jak/Stat pathway are also necessary for activation of Raf-1 by IFNs and OSM, we examined activation of Raf-1 in cell lines that are deficient in either Stat1α or Stat2. Unexpectedly, incubation of Stat1-deficient, but not Stat2-deficient cells with IFNγ or OSM for 5 min displayed no increase in Raf-1 activity. In peripheral blood lymphocytes Raf-1 was associated with Stat1, and this interaction was disrupted after incubation of cells with IFNγ. Stat1-negative cells reconstituted with either Stat1α or Stat1α with a point mutation in the site where it is serine-phosphorylated displayed normal activation of Raf-1 by IFNγ and OSM. However, activation of Raf-1 was not observed in lines that expressed Stat1α containing a mutation in its tyrosine phosphorylation site or in its SH2 domain.

This process involves a cascade of enzymes initiated by the Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases of which Raf-1 is the best characterized member. Recent studies from this laboratory and others clearly demonstrated that the Jak/Stat and Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling cascades are intimately linked (3David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R.

A serine residue located at amino acid 727 in Stat1α was shown to be phosphorylated in response to IFNγ treatment. Mutation of this site decreased activation of several IFNγ-stimulated, Stat-regulated genes (6Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) and also abrogated the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of IFNγ (7Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. J.

IFNs and OSM also rapidly stimulate p42 MAP kinase activity, and the kinase itself has been shown to associate with the α chain of the IFNα receptor, the gp130 subunit of the OSM receptor, and Stat1α (Ref. 3David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar and data not shown). In addition, expression of mutated forms of p42 MAPK, such that they have no enzymatic activity, inhibits IFNα/β- and IFNγ-stimulated luciferase reporter constructs containing either GAS or ISRE enhancers (3David M.

Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar).The mechanisms that control Raf activation are poorly understood. Activation of Raf by most mitogens and OSM is Ras-dependent (9Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, constitutively active Jak1 expressed in COS cells results in elevated Raf-1 activity (4Stancato L.F. Sakatsume M. David M. Dent P. Dong F. Petricoin E.F. Krolewski J.J. Silvennoinen O.

In the studies presented here, we observed that expression of the Stat1 transcription factor also is required for IFNγ and OSM stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity.RESULTSThe availability of cell lines which are deficient in specific components required for IFN activation of the Jak/Stat pathway allowed us to examine whether the Stat proteins might regulate Raf-1 activation by IFNγ and OSM. OSM, which uses the gp130 receptor chain in a manner similar to the cytokines interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor, has been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat1 and Stat3 while IFNγ activates primarily Stat1. Wild type 2fTGH cells express a mutated, constitutively active p21ras (6Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), leading to elevated Raf-1 activity which does not allow for analysis of cytokine-regulated endogenous Raf-1 activity. We therefore transfected cells with a CAAX and myc epitope-tagged Raf-1, which contains a mutation in the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (R89LRaf-1) (12Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of this protein is independent of Ras. Transfected R89LRaf-1 was immunoprecipitated from 2fTGH cells with an antibody against the myc epitope tag, and Raf-1 activity was assayed by measuring incorporation of 32P into kinase-inactive MAPK, which reflects the relative activity of the immunoprecipitated Raf-1. As shown previously (4Stancato L.F. Sakatsume M. David M. Dent P. Dong F. Petricoin E.F. Krolewski J.J. Silvennoinen O. Saharinen P. Pierce J. Marshall C.J. Sturgill T. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3833-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and in Fig. 1, myc-tagged Raf-1 transfected into 2fTGH cells showed enhanced activity when cells were exposed to IFNγ or OSM. Although a representative experiment is displayed in Fig. 1, an average of three experiments demonstrated that IFNγ stimulated the transfected Raf-1 kinase activity 3.6 ± 0.7-fold and OSM 2.0 ± 0.3-fold. R89LRaf-1 was also transfected in Stat1-deficient U3A cells and Stat2-deficient U6A cells. Both of these cell lines were derived from 2fTGH cells and selected for defects in IFN-stimulated gene expression (13Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although the U6A cell line showed stimulation of R89LRaf-1 activity by IFNγ (3.4 ± 0.5-fold) and OSM (2.0 ± 0.2-fold) comparable to the parental 2fTGH cells (lanes 9-11), U3A cells, which do not express Stat1, showed no activation of Raf-1 by either cytokine (lanes 5-7). Similar results were seen with IFNα/β activation of Raf-1 (data not shown).To determine whether there was a global defect in U3A cells with regard to regulation of Raf-1 kinase, we incubated cells with pervanadate, which stimulates Raf-1 activity in a ligand-independent manner. There was no statistically significant difference in pervanadate-stimulated Raf-1 activity between all three cell lines (Fig. 1, lanes 4, 8, and 12).Because U3A cells were selected by chemical mutagenesis for a defect in IFN activation of immediate early genes, we wanted to ensure that no mutation other than their failure to express Stat1 accounts for their inability to support IFNγ and OSM activation of R89LRaf-1. Therefore, stable cell lines derived from U3A cells, which were transfected with Stat1α, were analyzed for IFNγ and OSM activation of transfected R89LRaf-1 (Fig. 2). When wild type Stat1α was expressed in U3A cells, IFNγ and OSM activation of Raf-1 was equivalent to the parental 2fTGH cell line.Figure 2Tyrosine 701 and the SH2 domain of Stat1 are required for IFNγ and OSM activation of Raf-1. U3A cells stably expressing wild type Stat1 (lanes 1-3), S727A Stat1 (lanes 4-6), Y701F (lanes 7-9), or SH2 mutant Stat1 (lanes 10-12) were transfected with 3 μg of R89LRaf1 + 1 μg of SV40 large T-antigen plasmid and treated and lysed as described in Fig. 1. Myc epitope-tagged R89LRaf-1 was immunoprecipitated and assayed for kinase activity. The fold stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity on S727A Stat1 U3A cells was 2.6 ± 0.3-fold with IFNγ treatment and 2.7 ± 0.4-fold with OSM treament. Cells reconstituted with Y701F or the SH2-mutated Stat1 showed no significant increase in either IFNγ- or OSM-stimulated Raf-1 activity compared with untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)There are several conserved domains in the Stat family of transcription factors including the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, the SH2 domains, and the serine phosphorylation sites in Stat1, -3, and -4 (14Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether these conserved motifs were required for IFN and OSM activation of Raf-1, U3A cells were selected with the appropriate mutation. These cell lines were transfected with R89LRaf-1 to analyze for its activation as a result of treatment of cells with IFNγ or OSM (Fig. 2). Substitution of serine 727 with alanine in the transfected Stat1α did not alter the ability of IFNγ or OSM to stimulate Raf-1 activity (compare lanes 1-6). Expression of Stat1α with a mutation in its SH2 domain or tyrosine 701, which is phosphorylated as a result of incubation of cells with cytokines, showed no activation of Raf-1 (lanes 7-12). Incubation of these cells with IFNβ gave similar results (data not shown). All reconstituted lines showed about the same levels of expression of Stat1α as 2fTGH cells (data not shown).Stat3, like Stat1, contains a serine in its carboxyl terminus which is phosphorylated as a result of incubation of cells with a variety of cytokines. Although activation of Stat3 by IFNs is not seen in 2fTGH cells (6Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), incubation of cells including 2fTGH cells with cytokines signaling through the gp130 receptor subunit stimulate robust tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. We therefore wanted to determine whether Stat1 was required for OSM activation of both Raf-1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of other Stats or whether Stat1 was selectively needed for activation of Raf-1. 2fTGH cells and U3A cells were incubated with OSM for 5 or 15 min, and cellular extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with Stat1 or Stat3 antisera. Cells were also incubated with IFNγ under the same conditions as an internal control for tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. Immunopellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting blots were probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3). In 2fTGH cells both IFNγ and OSM stimulated about the same degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 while only OSM activated Stat3. Incubation of U3A cells with OSM also resulted in strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, similar to that seen in parental cells. These results clearly indicate that while Stat1 is required for OSM activation of Raf-1, its expression has no influence on the ability of this cytokine to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. It thus appears that the regulatory function of Stat1 is specific for activation of the Raf-1.Figure 3OSM-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 is not altered in Stat1-negative U3A cells. 2fTGH (panel A) or U3A cells (panel B) were serum-starved for 2 h prior to treatment with 20 ng/ml IFNγ or 0.1 ng/ml OSM for the indicated times. Cell lysates were prepared as in Fig. 1, and either Stat1 or Stat3 was immunoprecipitated. Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, the membranes were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The membranes were then counterblotted with monoclonal antibodies directed against the indicated Stat protein. Stat1 was not detectable in U3A cells by Western blot (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although expression of Stat1 was clearly required for IFNγ and OSM stimulated Raf-1 activity, we were not able to detect a reproducible association between these two proteins in cell extracts derived from 2fTGH cells (data not shown). However, a stable association of these proteins may not occur because these cells express mutated p21ras, which results in constitutively activated Raf-1 (5Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To determine whether an association between Raf-1 and Stat1 might exist in nontransformed cells we used primary PBLs isolated from normal human donors. PBLs were incubated with phytohemagglutinin for 72 h to stimulate proliferation of T cells as well as to render them sensitive to treatment with IFNγ (15Sakatsume M. Finbloom D.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4160-4166PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed and incubated in medium with 2% fetal calf serum for 18 h prior to the addition of IFNγ. Cellular extracts were prepared from untreated and IFNγ-treated PBLs and immunoprecipitated with Raf-1 antiserum (Fig. 4 A) and resolved proteins transferred to Immobilon. Blots were probed for the presence of Stat1 (upper panel). Stat1 is constitutively associated with Raf-1 in PBLs (lane 1) while nonimmune rabbit serum failed to detect significant amounts of either Stat1 or Raf-1 (lane 4). Incubation of PBLs with IFNγ for as little as 1 min resulted in the loss of Raf-1 association with Stat1 (lanes 2 and 3). Similar results were observed with respect to IFNα/β-stimulated dissociation of Raf-1 and Stat1 in PBLs (data not shown). Reprobing the blot for the presence of Raf-1 indicated that it was present at the same concentrations in all samples (lanes 1-3, lower panel). Under similar conditions we have not been able to detect Stat3 or Stat5 associated with Raf-1 (data not shown).Figure 4Associations of Stat1, Raf-1, and Jak1 in peripheral blood lymphocytes. A, PBLs were incubated with or without IFNγ for either 1 or 5 min. Cell extracts were prepared and incubated with Raf-1 antiserum (lanes 1-3), nonimmune serum (lane 4), or Stat1 antiserum (lane 5). The resulting immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. The membrane was probed either with Stat1 antiserum (21Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K.

B and C, PBLs were incubated with IFNγ as in A, and cellular extracts were prepared and incubated with Jak1 antiserum (lanes 1 and2) or nonspecific antiserum (lanes 3and 4). The resulting blots were probed for the presence of either Raf-1 (B) or Stat1 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although we have been able to detect IFNγ-stimulated activation of Erk2 in primary PBLs, activation of Raf-1 has been inconsistent. In HeLa cells a constitutive association of Jak1 and Raf-1 has been observed using the same Raf-1 antiserum used in Fig. 4 A(10Sakatsume M. Stancato L.F. David M. Silvennoinen O. Saharinen P. Pierce J. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3021-3026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether Raf-1 and Jak1 interact with each other in primary PBLs, cells were incubated with or without IFNγ for 5 min and cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with Jak1 antiserum (lanes 1 and 2) or nonspecific antiserum (lanes 3 and 4). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the membranes were probed for either the presence of Raf-1 (Fig. 4 B) or Stat1 (Fig. 4 C). Similar to HeLa cells, a specific association between Jak1 and Raf-1 can be detected in primary PBLs. Although the amount of Raf-1 associated with Jak1 is modest in this experiment, if Raf-1 antiserum is used instead of Jak1 antiserum the degree of association between these proteins appears to be enhanced (data not shown). We could also detect a specific association between Jak1 and Stat1 in PBLs (Fig. 4 C). Similar to interactions between Jak1 and Raf-1, the association between Jak1 and Stat1 also is not altered by incubation of cells with IFNγ (compare lanes 1 and 2). In summary, these data support the notion that Stat1 is an integral component of the signaling complex required for activation of Raf-1 by OSM, IFNγ, IFNα/β, and possibly by other cytokines.DISCUSSIONThe role of Stats as key components in cytokine-stimulated immediate early genes is well documented. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is required for their ability to bind DNA while serine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 is required for them to function optimally as transcriptional activators. The role that IFN- and OSM-stimulated Raf kinase serves in the biological actions of these cytokines is being investigated. Recent studies in this laboratory indicate that the antiproliferative actions of IFNs are absent in cells derived from mouse embryos with targeted deletions of the Raf kinases (data not shown). Stat1 may therefore function in a regulatory loop which allows coordinate activation of both the Jak/Stat and Raf/MAPK signaling cascades.Our results indicate that in addition to its role as a transcription factor, Stat1 also is essential for stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity by several cytokines including OSM, IFNγ, and IFNα/β (data not shown). The detailed mechanisms by which Stat1 controls IFN- and OSM-stimulated activation of Raf-1 are being examined. However, it is clear that other Stat proteins such as Stat2 and Stat3 cannot substitute for Stat1 in stimulating Raf-1 kinase activity. The fact that tyrosine 701 in Stat1 (as well as a functional SH2 domain), which is phosphorylated as a consequence of cytokine treatment of cells, is required for IFNs and OSM to stimulate Raf-1 activity suggests that Stat1 may function as a docking protein to permit recruitment of Raf-1 into signaling complexes, containing Jaks, p42 MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and other key regulatory enzymes which modulate both the Raf/MEK/MAPK and Jak/Stat signaling cascades (3David M.

Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Stat1 can also be detected in immunoprecipitates of Raf-1 in PBLs, and this association is absent after incubation of cells with IFN (Fig. 4). These results imply that the mechanisms by which Raf-1 binds to Stat1 (either directly or indirectly) and the role that Stat1 plays in IFN activation of Raf-1 are distinct.Incubation of cells with either IFNγ or OSM for only 5 min stimulates Raf-1 activity. This finding suggests that Stat1 does not function as a transcription factor in this process in the sense that it needs to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, translocate to the nucleus, and stimulate the expression of an early response gene(s) whose protein product(s) are required for IFN and OSM stimulation of Raf-1. However, it has been recently demonstrated that Stat1 can affect the constitutive expression of caspase RNAs by a mechanism that does not require that the protein be tyrosine-phosphorylated (20Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the constitutive expression of Stat1 is affecting the expression of a protein which is required for stimulation of Raf-1 by IFNs, OSM, and possibly other cytokines. The fact that vanadate treatment of either wild type or Stat1-negative cells stimulates Raf-1 kinase activation to the same extent argues that the components needed to stimulate Raf-1 by a non-receptor-mediated process are not dependent on the expression of Stat1.As far as we are aware, this is the first example of a protein which not only directly or indirectly regulates RNA polymerase II activity, but also regulates the enzymatic activity of a cytoplasmic kinase that has important functions in cell proliferation, development, and differentiation.

This process involves a cascade of enzymes initiated by the Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases of which Raf-1 is the best characterized member. Recent studies from this laboratory and others clearly demonstrated that the Jak/Stat and Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling cascades are intimately linked (3David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R.

Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). A serine residue located at amino acid 727 in Stat1α was shown to be phosphorylated in response to IFNγ treatment. Mutation of this site decreased activation of several IFNγ-stimulated, Stat-regulated genes (6Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) and also abrogated the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of IFNγ (7Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. J.

A. 1996; 93: 7673-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Serine 727 in Stat1α is conserved in Stat3 and Stat4 and is an ideal site for proline-directed serine kinases such as MAP kinases. IFNs and OSM also rapidly stimulate p42 MAP kinase activity, and the kinase itself has been shown to associate with the α chain of the IFNα receptor, the gp130 subunit of the OSM receptor, and Stat1α (Ref. 3David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar and data not shown). In addition, expression of mutated forms of p42 MAPK, such that they have no enzymatic activity, inhibits IFNα/β- and IFNγ-stimulated luciferase reporter constructs containing either GAS or ISRE enhancers (3David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control Raf activation are poorly understood. Activation of Raf by most mitogens and OSM is Ras-dependent (9Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol.

AnAscaris SL of two nucleotides is accuratelytrans-spliced in vitro (9Maroney P.A. Hannon G.J. Shambaugh J.D. Nilsen T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3869-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating that information for splicing is not contained within the SL. By contrast, the SL sequence is important for both transcription (10Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) andtrans-splicing (11Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in some kinetoplastids. Although the U5 small nuclear RNA may be cross-linked to exons near the splice junction (12Wise J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1978-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the roles of exons in cis-splicing are generally constrained by their protein-coding capacities. There are no such constraints apparent in trans-splicing. The kinetoplastid SL functions as a cap 4 donor (13Lenardo M.J. Dorfman D.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2487-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and as a 5′-untranslated region, allowing the possibility for an active role intrans-splicing. Several inter- and intramolecular interactions have been predicted to occur within the SL. Two small RNAs, SL-associated 1 and U5, have been demonstrated through in vivo cross-linking to interact with the SL (14Watkins K.P. Dungan J.M. Agabian N. Cell. 1994; 76: 171-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Dungan J.M. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Intramolecular interactions of the SL include alternation between two structural forms involving SL-SL (Form I) and SL-intron (Form II) base pairing in vitro (16LeCuyer K.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and in vivo (17Harris Jr., K.A. Crothers D.M. Ullu E. RNA. 1995; 1: 351-362PubMed Google Scholar) and proposed U1 and U5 functions (18Steitz J.A. Science. 1992; 257: 888-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the conserved kinetoplastid SL intrans-splicing we evaluated several SL mutants fortrans-splicing in vivo. We show that SLs containing 10-bp replacement mutations between positions 10 and 39 are efficiently and accurately trans-spliced. In addition, some spliced mutants are undermethylated at their 5′ ends. These results indicate that neither the primary sequence of a 39-nt SL nor cap 4 methylation are critical for trans-splicing; however, there may be constraints on the absolute size of the SL. The intron tag (IT) containing SL mutations (1/9, 10/19, 20/29, and 30/39, which introduced an XhoI site) were generated originally for promoter localization studies (7Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An SL reporter lacking the IT was created by removal of the IT from 30/39 and called tagged SL (tSL). Control plasmids that lack active promoters were constructed by PCR (7Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), resulting in the −67/−58 versions of 1/9, 10/19, 20/29, 30/39, and tSL. The shortened SLs, −20 and −10, were created by subcloning the XhoI-KpnI fragments from 10/19 or from 20/29 into the tSL vector. SLs of increased size were generated by digestion of tSL with XhoI followed by Klenow fill-in and religation (+4) or insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide possessingXhoI-compatible ends (+24).

Products were isolated, cloned, and sequenced as described previously (3Sturm N.R. Fernandes O. Campbell D.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 177-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance in trans-splicing of particular SL sequence elements was examined for a series of SL mutations generated following a linker scan approach in conjunction with an IT (7Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and derivative mutations lacking the IT and varying in SL size (summarized in Fig. 1 A). The predicted size differences because of the presence of IT sequences or exon mutations are indicated (Fig. 1 A) and shown in total RNA from transfectants electrophoresed through an acrylamide-urea gel (Fig. 1 B). The +4 and +24 SL RNAs each required specific exon probes and migrated as predicted on comparable 8% gels (data not shown). These data confirmed the transcript size predictions of the various constructions and demonstrated that transcription was not affected by mutation of the SL RNA gene sequences. To assay for trans-splicing, total RNAs from mutants were hybridized with the exon tag oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 A; data not shown for SL size mutants and not determined for 1/9). The unspliced, mutated SL RNAs were visible at the bottom of the blots. Hybridization of tag-specific oligonucleotides to higher molecular weight RNA species in 10/19, 20/29, 30/39, and tSL but not in their respective promoter knockout (7Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) mutants indicated that active trans-splicing of the mutated SLs occurred. The ∼1.4-kilobase bands and faint background present in RNA from the four promoter knockout mutants were anticipated artifacts, reflecting transcripts from the randomly initiated run-around transcription that drives the neomycin resistance gene (23Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 24Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Laban A. Wirth D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The −10, −20, +4, and +24 SLs did not appear to be efficient substrates for trans-splicing by this assay (data not shown). The transfectant mRNAs were examined in a more sensitive manner and for accuracy of splicing by RT-PCR, blot and nucleotide sequence analysis for the presence of mutated SL on arl andubi mRNAs. Spliced products containing SL transcribed from the tSL, −10, 20/29, 30/39, +4, and +24 constructions were amplified by RT-PCR using general 5′ oligonucleotides (i.e.both WT and exon-tagged trans-splicing products amplify); −20, 1/9, and 10/19 required specific, exon tag-inclusive, 5′ oligonucleotides because of the close proximity of the tag to the 5′ end of the SL (Fig. 2 B). RNAs from the inactive promoter transfectants (−67/−58+1/9, etc.) were used as substrates in parallel amplifications as controls for reaction specificity for the scan mutations (data not shown). General amplification products were transferred and hybridized with oligonucleotides directed against the exon tag sequences, revealing trans-splicing of the queried mRNAs by 20/29, 30/39, and tSL (Fig. 2 B). Because of the close proximity of the mutations to the 5′ end of the SL, the 1/9 and 10/19 transfectants were assayed by amplification with mutation-specific primers that indicated splicing of 10/19 but not of 1/9 (Fig. 2 B). When subjected to the RT-PCR assay, the −20 and −10 SLs did not yield trans-splicing products even with mutation-specific 5′ primers (data not shown). +4 and +24 were inefficient substrates for trans-splicing, because products were generated with the mutant-specific 5′ primer but not the general primer (Fig. 2 B). The resulting RT-PCR products for arl and ubimRNAs were cloned and sequenced to determine the accuracy oftrans-splicing for 10/19, 20/29, 30/39, and tSL transfectants. In each case, trans-splicing with the mutated SL was mapped to the site previously identified as WT (25Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 144: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), 2N. R. Sturm and D. A. Campbell, unpublished data. with an additional, alternative, splice acceptor site mapped for the arlmRNA with one of the 20/29 clones (data not shown). The sequence data confirm that the RT-PCR reactions were not producing artifactual products and that these scan SLs were trans-spliced accurately. Lack of detectable spliced products containing the 1/9 SL may be a result of the low abundance of mutated precursor SL RNA, which was previously shown to be efficiently transcribed but unstable (7Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Changing the initiation nucleotide from an A to a C residue will prevent addition of the 7meG cap to the SL RNA, thus reducing the stability of the 1/9 SL RNA and any mRNAs receiving this mutated SL. The inefficient splicing of the SL size exons +4 and +24 and the apparent lack of splicing in −10 and −20 indicate that the size of the SL is important. However, accurate splicing of the three scan 39-nt SLs shows that the primary sequence outside of the cap 4 region is not critical for trans-splicing. The efficiencies of trans-splicing for the mutated SLs from 20/29, 30/39, and tSL transfectants were determined by comparing the proportion of mutated versus WT spliced products in the general RT-PCR product pool to the proportion of mutatedversus WT SLs in the substrate populations. Direct comparison of hybridization signals for mutated and WT SLs (Fig. 3 A) revealed that the 10/19 SL RNA was 2% of the total unspliced SL population, the 20/29 SL was 3%, and the 30/39 SL was 6%. tSL was approximately 2% in the RNA samples used for the PCR assays, as determined by normalization of duplicate blots with the SL-associated 1 RNA (Ref. 26Roberts T.G. Dungan J.M. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and data not shown). The ratio of WT:mutated SL trans-spliced products gave internally consistent results, indicating that the proportion oftrans-spliced mutated:WT SLs was equivalent to the proportion of substrate mutant:WT SL in total RNA. If the mutant SL was PCR-amplified proportionally to the WT SL RNAs, we define this as efficient trans-splicing. The proportional nature of the amplification was demonstrated by amplifying varying amounts of the cloned WT and tSL spliced arl cDNAs and comparing the signals of the resulting products to the signal of the input plasmids (data not shown). Thus, the mutations within the SL had a minimal effect on the efficiency of trans-splicing. Primer extension analysis was performed to examine the methylation status of the cap 4 at the 5′ end of the mutated SLs (Fig. 3 B). The IT mutant was used for determination of WT methylation levels; this construction has no exon mutation and showed comparable methylation to WT SL (data not shown). 30/39 SL methylation varied with RNA preparations between 33 (Fig. 3 B) and 75% (data not shown) as seen in IT (Fig. 3 B). Surprisingly, the unstable SL 1/9 was methylated at 75% (extended exposure, Fig. 3 B), indicating that methylation and capping are not linked. 10/19 and 20/29 showed sharply reduced methylation (<5%; extended exposure, Fig. 3 B), allowing the RT to progress 3 or 4 nucleotides farther along the transcript and resulting in a larger product. The majority of 10/19 products extended to +1; 20/29 extended predominantly to +2. SL tag-specific oligonucleotides were used to confirm the methylation results for the 10/19 and 20/29 transfectants (data not shown) and to examine the −10 and −20 SL RNAs. The tSL mutant is consistently methylated at 75% in the WT pattern, but −10 and −20 showed reduced methylation (data not shown).

Efficient splicing of under-methylated SL contrasts with findings in whole and permeabilized cells (27Ullu E. Tschudi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10074-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28McNally K.P. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4844-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13068-13073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies usingS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (27Ullu E. Tschudi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10074-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and sinefungin (28McNally K.P. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4844-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are likely to have had a global effect on cellular methylation processes and not inhibited SL methylation exclusively. Thus, these results are reflective of the importance of methylation in thetrans-splicing pathway as a whole rather than methylation of the SL in particular. The antisense oligonucleotide studies may have been confounded by the presence of the oligonucleotide itself forming a duplex structure that could affect other SL interactions in addition to disrupting the cap 4 formation process (29Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13068-13073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that the SL sequence between positions 10 and 39 is not important for trans-splicing and suggest that the secondary structure of stem-loop I (16LeCuyer K.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is not necessary for accurate trans-splicing. However, there appears to be an optimal size for the SL for splicing in vivo, unlike the situation in Ascaris where the exon size can vary from 2–246 nt and maintain efficient splicing in vitro (9Maroney P.A. Hannon G.J. Shambaugh J.D. Nilsen T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3869-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results contrast with those of Lücke et al. (11Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whose studies conclude that much of the SL sequence is important for splicing; they also conclude that size is not limiting based on a single efficiently spliced mutant with a 45-nt exon (+6 nt). The results of our two studies are largely in agreement regarding the areas of the exon important for methylation of the cap 4 (11Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); however, the role of the cap 4 methylations in the trans-splicing process is challenged by the efficient splicing in Leishmania of the 20/29 mutation and, based on the total RNA analysis, the 10/19 mutation. The interpretation of negative trans-splicing results must be approached with caution, because the result may be due to secondary effects of the mutation; a positive result provokes further study. Because our studies reveal that contingencies for splicing do not exist within the primary sequence of the kinetoplastid SL, we are left to hypothesize that the conservation is necessary for proper function of the translation machinery in these organisms. In future experiments we will attempt to address this possibility directly. We thank T. Guy Roberts and Michael C. Yu for stimulating discussions, Jiang ZhiMing for making two of the constructs, and Doug Black and Dan Ray for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2052092301,"The atmospheric residence time for methyl bromide (CH3Br) has been estimated as 0.8 +/- 0.1 years from its empirical spatial variability relative to C2H6, C2Cl4, CHCl3, and CH3Cl. This evaluation of the atmospheric residence time, based on Junge's 1963 general proposal, provides an estimate for CH3Br that is independent of source and sink estimates. Methyl bromide from combined natural and anthropogenic sources furnishes about half of the bromine that enters the stratosphere, where it plays an important role in ozone destruction. This residence time is consistent with the 0.7-year value recently calculated for CH3Br from the combined strength estimates for its known significant sinks."
