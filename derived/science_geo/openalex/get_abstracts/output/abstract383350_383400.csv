It has emerged that Aβ toxicity is tau dependent, although mechanistically this link remains unclear. Here, we show that tau, known as axonal protein, has a dendritic function in postsynaptic targeting of the Src kinase Fyn, a substrate of which is the NMDA receptor (NR). Missorting of tau in transgenic mice expressing truncated tau (Δtau) and absence of tau in tau−/− mice both disrupt postsynaptic targeting of Fyn. This uncouples NR-mediated excitotoxicity and hence mitigates Aβ toxicity. Δtau expression and tau deficiency prevent memory deficits and improve survival in Aβ-forming APP23 mice, a model of AD. These deficits are also fully rescued with a peptide that uncouples the Fyn-mediated interaction of NR and PSD-95 in vivo. Our findings suggest that this dendritic role of tau confers Aβ toxicity at the postsynapse with direct implications for pathogenesis and treatment of AD."

A cell type expressing this receptor is the osteoblast, a bone-specific cell favoring glucose metabolism through a hormone, osteocalcin, that becomes active once uncarboxylated. We show here that insulin signaling in osteoblasts is necessary for whole-body glucose homeostasis because it increases osteocalcin activity. To achieve this function insulin signaling in osteoblasts takes advantage of the regulation of osteoclastic bone resorption exerted by osteoblasts. Indeed, since bone resorption occurs at a pH acidic enough to decarboxylate proteins, osteoclasts determine the carboxylation status and function of osteocalcin. Accordingly, increasing or decreasing insulin signaling in osteoblasts promotes or hampers glucose metabolism in a bone resorption-dependent manner in mice and humans. Hence, in a feed-forward loop, insulin signals in osteoblasts activate a hormone, osteocalcin, that promotes glucose metabolism.

Bone also emerged recently as an endocrine organ regulating glucose metabolism (Fukumoto and Martin, 2009Fukumoto S. Martin T.J. Bone as an endocrine organ.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 230-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a function that has been ascribed to date only to the osteoblast. The intricacy existing between osteoblasts and osteoclasts raises the prospect, however, that the osteoclast may contribute to the endocrine role of the skeleton. Bone uses the osteoblast-specific secreted molecule osteocalcin to favor glucose homeostasis. Circulating osteocalcin exists in two forms, carboxylated on 3 glutamate residues or undercarboxylated; the latter form being able to enhance insulin secretion by β-cells, insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure (Lee et al., 2007Lee N.K. Sowa H. Hinoi E. Ferron M. Ahn J.D. Confavreux C. Dacquin R. Mee P.J. McKee M.D. Jung D.Y. et al.Endocrine regulation of energy metabolism by the skeleton.Cell. 2007; 130: 456-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Osteocalcin (Ocn), however, is not the only gene expressed in osteoblasts affecting glucose homeostasis. Esp, a gene encoding an intracellular tyrosine phosphatase called OST-PTP exerts, through its osteoblast expression, metabolic functions opposite to those of osteocalcin (Lee et al., 2007Lee N.K. Sowa H. Hinoi E. Ferron M. Ahn J.D. Confavreux C. Dacquin R. Mee P.J. McKee M.D. Jung D.Y. et al.Endocrine regulation of energy metabolism by the skeleton.Cell. 2007; 130: 456-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence show that Esp acts upstream of Ocn to inhibit its metabolic function. For instance, the metabolic phenotype of Esp−/− mice is fully corrected by removing one allele of Ocn even though Ocn+/− mice have no metabolic phenotype, and the fraction of undercarboxylated osteocalcin is significantly higher in Esp−/− than in wild-type (WT) mouse serum. The role of the osteoblast in regulating glucose metabolism revealed by these and other findings (Rached et al., 2010aRached M.-T. Kode A. Silva B.C. Jung D.Y. Gray S. Ong H. Paik J.-H. DePinho R.A. Kim J.K. Karsenty G. et al.FoxO1 expression in osteoblasts regulates glucose homeostasis through regulation of osteocalcin in mice.J. Clin.

The transcription factor ATF4 regulates glucose metabolism in mice through its expression in osteoblasts.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2807-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) raises questions. The first one is to explain how OST-PTP, an intracellular tyrosine phosphatase, can influence the carboxylation and function of a secreted molecule like osteocalcin. A second issue is to provide evidence that the same bone-dependent regulation of glucose metabolism exists in humans since ESP is a pseudogene in this species (Cousin et al., 2004Cousin W. Courseaux A. Ladoux A. Dani C. Peraldi P. Cloning of hOST-PTP: the only example of a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase the function of which has been lost between rodent and human.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A third question of physiological nature looming beyond these observations is whether insulin, in a feedback loop, influences osteocalcin synthesis and/or activity. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase whose activity must be tightly regulated since it can be activated in the absence of ligand (Kasuga et al., 1983Kasuga M. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Blithe D.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Characterization of the insulin receptor kinase purified from human placental membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10973-10980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinases are often inhibited by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (Schlessinger, 2000Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar) and PTP1B, which dephosphorylates the insulin receptor, is a major regulator of insulin signaling in hepatocytes and myocytes (Delibegovic et al., 2007Delibegovic M.

The fact that OST-PTP is a tyrosine phosphatase raises the testable hypothesis that the insulin receptor is one of its substrates. Our understanding of insulin signaling in various tissues has been profoundly altered by the analysis of mutant mouse strains lacking the insulin receptor in only one cell type (Bluher et al., 2002Bluher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Adipose tissue selective insulin receptor knockout protects against obesity and obesity-related glucose intolerance.Dev.

Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these studies failed to demonstrate a major influence of insulin signaling in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis in two classical insulin target tissues, muscle, and white fat (Bluher et al., 2002Bluher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Adipose tissue selective insulin receptor knockout protects against obesity and obesity-related glucose intolerance.Dev.

Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). An implication of these observations is that insulin may act in additional organs in order to maintain glucose homeostasis. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that the insulin receptor is expressed in many cell types where its functions have not yet been analyzed. This is particularly relevant to the osteoblast since it expresses the insulin receptor and regulates insulin secretion (Figure 1A ) (Lee et al., 2007Lee N.K. Sowa H. Hinoi E. Ferron M. Ahn J.D. Confavreux C. Dacquin R. Mee P.J. McKee M.D. Jung D.Y. et al.Endocrine regulation of energy metabolism by the skeleton.Cell. 2007; 130: 456-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the insulin receptor is a substrate of OST-PTP and PTP1B in mouse and human osteoblasts, respectively. As a result, insulin signaling in osteoblasts enhances osteocalcin activity and impacts glucose homeostasis by promoting the ability of osteoblasts to enhance bone resorption. Indeed, because the acid pH in the resorption lacuna allows protein decarboxylation it is ultimately the activity of the osteoclast that determines the carboxylation status and function of osteocalcin secreted by the osteoblast. These results reveal a pH-dependent mechanism of activation for a hormone and identify insulin signaling in osteoblasts as a critical link between bone remodeling and energy metabolism. In order to define the mechanism whereby Esp affects osteocalcin carboxylation, we asked whether osteocalcin and/or enzymes required for its carboxylation, γ-carboxylase and Vkorc1 (Sadler, 2004Sadler J.E. Medicine: K is for koagulation.Nature. 2004; 427: 493-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and could be substrates of OST-PTP. We failed to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of these enzymes or of an osteocalcin peptide including all tyrosine residues of this molecule (Figures S1A–S1C available online). We also failed to detect physical interactions between osteocalcin, γ-carboxylase, or Vkorc1, and OST-PTP (Figures S1D–S1F). Although these negative results must be interpreted cautiously, they imply that OST-PTP does not affect osteocalcin carboxylation by acting directly on osteocalcin, γ-carboxylase, or Vkorc1. To pursue our search, we used substrate trapping, an assay using phosphatase domains in which a single amino acid substitution abrogates their catalytic activity, not their ability to recognize substrates (Flint et al., 1997Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Development of “substrate-trapping” mutants to identify physiological substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We used OST-PTP active phosphatase domain (Chengalvala et al., 2001Chengalvala M.V. Bapat A.R. Hurlburt W.W. Kostek B. Gonder D.S. Mastroeni R.A. Frail D.E. Biochemical characterization of osteo-testicular protein tyrosine phosphatase and its functional significance in rat primary osteoblasts.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to test whether the insulin receptor (InsR) was a substrate of OST-PTP for the following reasons. First, dephosphorylation of the InsR by another tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, regulates insulin signaling in other cell types (Delibegovic et al., 2007Delibegovic M. Bence K.K. Mody N. Hong E.G. Ko H.J. Kim J.K. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Improved glucose homeostasis in mice with muscle-specific deletion of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7727-7734Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Delibegovic et al., 2009Delibegovic M. Zimmer D. Kauffman C. Rak K. Hong E.G. Cho Y.R. Kim J.K. Kahn B.B. Neel B.G. Bence K.K. Liver-specific deletion of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) improves metabolic syndrome and attenuates diet-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Second, OST-PTP has homology in its catalytic domain to phosphatases dephosphorylating the InsR (Figure S1G ). Third, the InsR is abundant in osteoblasts and treatment of osteoblasts with insulin increases phosphorylation of the InsR and its downstream targets AKT, GSK3β, FoxO1 and p70S6K (Figure 1A and Figure S1H). Fourth, InsR phosphorylation increased in bone in a time-dependent manner following insulin injection in vivo (Figure 1B). Furthermore, we reasoned that if osteoblasts favor glucose homeostasis insulin signaling should influence osteoblast biology. The InsR interacted with a mutated form of OST-PTP or of PTP1B, a positive control, but not with negative controls such as wild-type (WT) OST-PTP, PTP1B or glutathione S-transferase (GST); InsR interaction with OST-PTP was competed by increasing concentrations of orthovanadate, OST-PTP interacted with InsR in cells following insulin treatment only, and did not interact with an unrelated tyrosine kinase receptor (Figures 1C–1E). Furthermore, WT OST-PTP dephosphorylated in vitro InsR while a mutant form of OST-PTP lacking its phosphatase activity did not (Figures 1F and 1G). Consistent with these results, phosphorylation of InsR on tyrosines 1150 and 1151 and of FoxO1, a target of insulin signaling (Puigserver et al., 2003Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J. Yoon J.C. Oriente F. Kitamura Y. Altomonte J. Dong H. Accili D. et al.Insulin-regulated hepatic gluconeogenesis through FOXO1-PGC-1alpha interaction.Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), was increased in Esp−/− osteoblasts (Figure 1H and Figures S1I and S1J). These experiments provide congruent biochemical evidence indicating that InsR is a substrate of OST-PTP in mouse osteoblasts. That insulin signaling in osteoblasts is regulated by OST-PTP, a phosphatase affecting glucose metabolism, implies that it also influences this process. To address this question, we generated osteoblast-specific Insulin Receptor (InsR)-deficient mice (InsRosb−/− mice) by crossing α1(I)collagen-Cre transgenic mice, which delete genes in osteoblasts only (Dacquin et al., 2002Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Mouse alpha1(I)-collagen promoter is the best known promoter to drive efficient Cre recombinase expression in osteoblast.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), with mice harboring a floxed allele of InsR (Figures S2A–S2C). Western blot analysis of osteoblasts showed at least 60% deletion of the InsR in osteoblasts but not in liver, pancreas, white adipose tissue, muscle, and brain of InsRosb−/− mice (Figures S2D–S2F). InsRosb−/− mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and at 8 weeks of age presented a significant elevation of blood glucose in the fed state and a significant reduction of serum insulin levels in the fasted or fed state, glucagon levels being unaffected (Figures 2A and 2B and Figure S2G ). A glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) test verified that insulin secretion was decreased in InsRosb−/− mice (Figure 2C). There was also a decrease in the number of islets, islet size, β-cell mass, β-cell proliferation and insulin content in InsRosb−/− compared to control pancreata (Figure 2D). As a result of this decrease in insulin secretion a glucose tolerance test (GTT) demonstrated glucose intolerance in InsRosb−/− mice (Figure 2E and Figure S2H). Insulin tolerance, as measured by an insulin tolerance test (ITT), was also significantly reduced in InsRosb−/− compared to control mice (Figure 2F and Figure S2I). Hence, analysis of InsRosb−/− mice revealed that insulin signaling in osteoblasts contributes to whole-body glucose homeostasis by increasing β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion and energy expenditure (Figure 2H and Figures S2J and S2K).Figure S2Generation of an Osteoblast-Specific Insulin Receptor (InsR)-Deficient Mouse, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Targeting strategy used to generate a floxed allele of InsR (InsR fl).

Insulin often transmits its signal by inhibiting FoxO1 activity. Since FoxO1 affects glucose homeostasis through its expression in osteoblasts (Rached et al., 2010aRached M.-T. Kode A. Silva B.C. Jung D.Y. Gray S. Ong H. Paik J.-H. DePinho R.A. Kim J.K. Karsenty G. et al.FoxO1 expression in osteoblasts regulates glucose homeostasis through regulation of osteocalcin in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we asked whether it was downstream of the insulin signaling pathway in these cells by generating InsRosb−/− mice lacking one copy of FoxO1 only in osteoblasts (InsRosb−/−;FoxO1osb+/− mice). As would be expected if FoxO1 does lie downstream of insulin signaling in osteoblasts, decreasing its expression corrected the glucose intolerance of InsRosb−/− mice. This result indicates that inhibiting FoxO1 is a means whereby insulin signaling in osteoblasts affects glucose homeostasis (Figures 2I–2L). Since OST-PTP inhibits osteocalcin activity, the observation that InsR is its substrate implies that insulin signaling in osteoblasts and osteocalcin lie in the same metabolic pathway. To test this hypothesis, we first generated mice lacking one allele of Osteocalcin and one allele of InsR in osteoblasts (Ocn+/−;InsRosb+/− mice), hypothesizing that if the two genes lie in the same pathway these compound heterozygous mutant mice should display a phenotype reminiscent of the one observed in Ocn−/− mice. Indeed, whether we studied glucose in fed state, insulin secretion, glucose or insulin tolerance, Ocn+/−;InsRosb+/− mice had metabolic abnormalities similar to the ones of Ocn−/− mice (Figures 3A–3E ), InsRosb+/− and Ocn+/− mice were undistinguishable from control littermates. Likewise, if OST-PTP inhibits the function of insulin signaling in osteoblasts one would anticipate that the metabolic phenotype of Esp−/− mice should be corrected by decreasing insulin signaling in osteoblasts. Accordingly, removing one allele of InsR in osteoblasts from Esp−/− mice normalized glucose and insulin tolerance (Figures 3F–3H). These two experiments provide genetic evidence that a function of insulin signaling in osteoblasts is to favor osteocalcin metabolic activity (Figure 3I). That reducing insulin signaling in osteoblasts corrected the enhanced glucose and insulin tolerance of Esp−/− mice was important in its own right, because it indicated that the metabolic phenotype of Esp−/− mice is secondary to an increase in insulin signaling in osteoblasts. This contention is supported by the increased phosphorylation of the InsR in Esp−/− osteoblasts (Figure 1H). Thus, in subsequent experiments studying insulin signaling in osteoblasts, we relied on both loss- (InsRosb−/−) and gain-of-function (Esp−/−) models. To ascertain that insulin signaling in osteoblasts regulates osteocalcin activity, we developed a dual ELISA quantifying the ratio between undercarboxylated, i.e., active (GLU), and carboxylated, i.e., inactive (GLA), circulating osteocalcin (Figures S3A–S3E). This ELISA detected an increase in undercarboxylated osteocalcin in Esp−/− mice, which harbor an increase in insulin signaling in osteoblasts (Figure 1H) but not in Esp−/−;InsRosb+/− mice that do not (Figure 3J). In contrast, it showed that undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were decreased when insulin signaling is impaired in osteoblasts (InsRosb−/− mice), even though Ocn expression and serum levels were not affected (Figure 3J and Figures S3F and S3G ). A decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin was also observed in Ocn+/−;InsRosb+/− mice that display a glucose intolerance similar to the one of the Ocn−/− and InsRosb−/− mice (Figure 3J and Figure S3H). These measurements of undecarboxylated osteocalcin in various mutant mouse strains along with the genetic evidence presented above indicate that insulin signaling in osteoblasts inhibits osteocalcin carboxylation, i.e., is a positive regulator of its metabolic activity. In a separate line of work, we noticed a marked decrease in the serum level of CTx, a marker of bone resorption, in InsRosb−/− mice, whereas this parameter was increased in Esp−/− mice (Figure 4A ). This data suggested that insulin signaling in osteoblasts favors bone resorption. Although not the focus of this study, bone formation parameters were severely decreased in InsRosb−/− mice; as a result, these mice had a low bone mass (Figure S4A ).Figure S4Bone Phenotype of InsRosb −/− Mice and siRNA-Mediated Downregulation of FoxO1 in Primary Mouse Osteoblasts, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Histomorphometric analysis of InsRosb −/− mice and control (InsR fl/fl) littermates.

(B) Western blot showing the specific decrease in FoxO1 protein levels in cells transfected with FoxO1 siRNA. β-actin levels were used as loading control. To prove that insulin signaling in osteoblasts affects bone resorption, we used a coculture assay of osteoblasts and osteoclasts (Takahashi et al., 1988Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Osteoblastic cells are involved in osteoclast formation.Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). When cocultured with WT osteoblasts, WT osteoclast precursor cells differentiated and formed resorption pits. When WT osteoclast precursor cells were cocultured with InsR−/− osteoblasts, the area covered by resorption pits was significantly decreased, whereas it increased 50% when cocultured with Esp−/− osteoblasts (Figure 4B). That the number of osteoclasts was unaffected whether we used Esp−/− or InsR−/− osteoblasts (Figure 4B) is consistent with the notion that insulin signaling in osteoblasts promotes only the function of osteoclasts. We next studied expression of genes influencing bone resorption in osteoblasts and noticed that expression of Osteoprotegerin (Opg), a gene encoding a decoy receptor for RANKL and a negative regulator of osteoclast function (Teitelbaum and Ross, 2003Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Genetic regulation of osteoclast development and function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar), was increased 2-fold in InsR−/− and decreased 50% in Esp−/− osteoblasts; its secretion followed the same pattern (Figures 4C–4E). That insulin treatment of WT but not of InsR−/− osteoblasts decreased Opg expression and secretion verified that it is an insulin target gene in osteoblasts (Figure 4E). To demonstrate that a moderate increase in OPG secretion inhibits the activity rather than the differentiation of osteoclasts, we cultured osteoclast progenitor cells in the presence of increasing amount of OPG (0–90 ng/ml). Low amounts of OPG in the culture medium decreased the surface covered by resorption pits but not the osteoclasts number (Figure 4F). Multiple evidences indicated that insulin signaling in osteoblasts favors bone resorption by inhibiting FoxO1. First, Opg expression was increased 2-fold in ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells overexpressing FoxO1 (Figure 4G). Second, siRNA-mediated downregulation of FoxO1 decreased Opg expression and secretion in mouse osteoblasts (Figure 4H and Figure S4B). Third, the increase in bone resorption noted in FoxO1obs−/− mice (Rached et al., 20"

Most eukaryotic cells rely on aerobic mitochondrial metabolism to generate ATP. Nevertheless, regulation of mitochondrial activity is incompletely understood. Here we identified an unexpected and essential role for constitutive InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ release in maintaining cellular bioenergetics. Macroautophagy provides eukaryotes with an adaptive response to nutrient deprivation that prolongs survival. Constitutive InsP3R Ca2+ signaling is required for macroautophagy suppression in cells in nutrient-replete media. In its absence, cells become metabolically compromised due to diminished mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Mitochondrial uptake of InsP3R-released Ca2+ is fundamentally required to provide optimal bioenergetics by providing sufficient reducing equivalents to support oxidative phosphorylation. Absence of this Ca2+ transfer results in enhanced phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and activation of AMPK, which activates prosurvival macroautophagy. Thus, constitutive InsP3R Ca2+ release to mitochondria is an essential cellular process that is required for efficient mitochondrial respiration and maintenance of normal cell bioenergetics.

Adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) production from substrate oxidation and the release of free energy from its hydrolysis must be balanced and sufficient to support cell metabolic needs, including growth, proliferation, production of metabolites, and maintenance of homeostatic processes. Most eukaryotic cells rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as the major source of ATP. However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis are controlled in intact cells are still not completely understood. Respiratory control models involving kinetic feedback from the products of ATP hydrolysis, allosteric effects of ATP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), rates of reducing equivalent delivery to mitochondria, O2 availability, and various controls over respiratory chain components are involved (Balaban, 1990Balaban R.S.

Nevertheless, neither the factors that exert primary control of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in the intact cell nor the signal transduction mechanisms that support the steady-state balance of ATP production and utilization are well understood (Balaban, 1990Balaban R.S.

In response to decreased cellular ATP, cells employ a variety of pathways to restore homeostasis, including activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Hardie, 2007Hardie D.G. AMP-activated/SNF1 protein kinases: conserved guardians of cellular energy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). AMPK phosphorylates substrates to limit anabolic pathways that consume ATP and to activate catabolic pathways to generate substrates to support oxidative phosphorylation (Hardie, 2007Hardie D.G. AMP-activated/SNF1 protein kinases: conserved guardians of cellular energy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Another mechanism involves activation of macroautophagy (autophagy), a degradation pathway involving delivery of cytoplasmic constituents by double-membrane autophagosomes (AV) that fuse with lysosomal membranes (Klionsky, 2007Klionsky D.J. Autophagy: from phenomenology to molecular understanding in less than a decade.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Under metabolic stress, prosurvival autophagy is induced, promoting recycling of metabolites to meet metabolic demands, through synthesis of new macromolecules or by their oxidation in mitochondria to maintain ATP levels (Levine and Kroemer, 2008Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar, Lum et al., 2005Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H.

Growth factor regulation of autophagy and cell survival in the absence of apoptosis.Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Autophagy also functions in developmental cell death, tumor suppression, immunity, and aging, and it has been implicated in neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Levine and Kroemer, 2008Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a fundamental cellular metabolic control mechanism involving activity of the endoplasmic reticulum-localized inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) Ca2+ release channel. In the absence of basal constitutive low-level Ca2+ signaling by the InsP3R, cells become metabolically compromised as a result of diminished Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria. Constitutive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake of InsP3R-released Ca2+ is fundamentally required to maintain sufficient mitochondrial NADH production to support oxidative phosphorylation in resting cells. Absence of this Ca2+ transfer results in inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase and activation of AMPK, which activates prosurvival autophagy by an mTOR-independent mechanism. These results reveal a heretofore unexpected and fundamentally essential role for constitutive low-level InsP3R Ca2+ release to mitochondria to maintain viable levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Chicken DT40 B lymphocytes with all three InsP3R isoforms genetically deleted (DT40-KO) is a uniquely InsP3R null cell line (Sugawara et al., 1997Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Genetic evidence for involvement of type 1, type 2 and type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors in signal transduction through the B-cell antigen receptor.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Despite lack of InsP3R, DT40-KO cells proliferate indefinitely in normal culture conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a significantly high percentage of knockout (KO) cells with autophagosomes (AV) (36% ± 2%) compared with InsP3R-expressing wild-type (WT) cells (11% ± 1%; Figure 1B ). Elevated autophagy in KO cells in normal growth conditions was also detected by quantitative measurements of the autophagy marker LC3-II (Klionsky et al., 2008Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S. Baba M. Baehrecke E.H. Bahr B.A. Ballabio A. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). In addition, presence of LC3-GFP puncta associated with early AV formation (Klionsky et al., 2008Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S. Baba M. Baehrecke E.H. Bahr B.A. Ballabio A. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) was higher in KO (18% ± 4%) versus WT (5% ± 1%) cells (Figure 1C). These results suggest that absence of InsP3R in DT40-KO cells increases constitutive levels of autophagy. Autophagy was not previously observed in DT40-KO cells (Vicencio et al., 2009Vicencio J.M. Ortiz C. Criollo A. Jones A.W. Kepp O. Galluzzi L. Joza N. Vitale I. Morselli E. Tailler M. et al.The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor regulates autophagy through its interaction with Beclin 1.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), but knockdown of InsP3R or its pharmacological inhibition also induces autophagy (Criollo et al., 2007Criollo A. Maiuri M.C. Tasdemir E. Vitale I. Fiebig A.A. Andrews D. Molgó J. Diaz J. Lavandero S. Harper F. et al.Regulation of autophagy by the inositol trisphosphate receptor.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar and below). Autophagy in KO cells was not associated with induction of the unfolded protein response (not shown). Lower level of autophagy observed in InsP3R-expressing WT cells was not due to intrinsic defects in autophagy, as serum starvation or leucine deprivation induced comparable autophagy in WT and KO cells (Figures S1A–S1D available online). Furthermore, mTOR inhibition by rapamycin strongly increased LC3-II levels, whereas 3-methyladenine (3MA), an inhibitor of class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) involved in AV formation (Levine and Kroemer, 2008Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar), inhibited LC3-II formation in both lines (Figure S1E ). Inhibition of lysosomal proteases enhanced LC3-II in both lines, especially in KO cells (Figures S1F and S1G), indicating that elevated autophagy in KO cells is due primarily to enhanced AV formation. The specific InsP3R inhibitor xestospongin B (XeB) (Jaimovich et al., 2005Jaimovich E. Mattei C. Liberona J.L. Cárdenas C. Estrada M. Barbier J. Debitus C. Laurent D. Molgó J. Xestospongin B, a competitive inhibitor of IP3-mediated Ca2+ signalling in cultured rat myotubes, isolated myonuclei, and neuroblastoma (NG108-15) cells.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2051-2057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) increased LC3-II only in WT cells (Figure 2A ). XeB increased AV by 22% ± 1% (LC3-GFP puncta; Figure S2A ) to 42% ± 2% (TEM; Figure 2B) in WT cells, whereas KO cells were unaffected. Reduction of InsP3 production by inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC, by 5 μM U73122) or inositol monophosphatase (IMPase, by 50 μM L-690,488) strongly enhanced LC3-II in WT cells, whereas it was without effect on autophagy already present in KO cells (Figures S2B and S2C). XeB also strongly enhanced LC3-II levels and puncta in primary rat pulmonary smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes, and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Figures S3A–S3C, S3G, and S3H), indicating that autophagy suppression by InsP3R activity is a general phenomenon operative in many cell types.Figure S2InsP3R Ca2+ Release Activity Specifically Is Required for Suppression of Autophagy and AMPK Activity, Related to Figure 2 and Figure 4Show full caption(A) GFP-LC3 puncta in DT40 cells treated with XeB (2 μM, 1 hr). n = 3 experiments (300 cells per experiment, 15 random fields per experiment).(B and C) DT40-WT and DT40-KO cells treated either with phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, its inactive analog U73343 (both 5 μM, 30 min) or the inositol monophosphatase inhibitor L-690,488 (50 μM, 1 hr).

Stable expression of InsP3R-3 (Figure S2D) completely rescued elevated autophagy in KO cells, measured as either LC3-II content (Figure 2D and Figure S2E) or AV visualization (not shown). To determine if its Ca2+ channel function was required, we examined cells expressing InsP3R-3 containing Thr at position 2591 replaced with Ala (T2591A). T2591A-InsP3R-3 expresses at normal levels (Figure S2D) but lacks ion channel activity as a result of a defective channel gate (J.K.F., unpublished data). In contrast to InsP3R-3, T2591A-InsP3R-3 did not suppress constitutive autophagy (Figure S2E). To determine whether failure to rescue was due specifically to loss of Ca2+ release activity, we examined KO cells expressing D2550A-InsP3R-3 (Figure S2D). This mutant gates normally, whereas it has complete loss of Ca2+ permeability (Figure 2C). D2550A-InsP3R-3 failed to suppress constitutive autophagy, with a tendency in these cells to have enhanced levels (Figures 2D and 2E). D2550A- and WT-InsP3R-3 bound similarly to Beclin-1 (Figure S2K), indicating that disruption of Beclin-1 binding (Vicencio et al., 2009Vicencio J.M. Ortiz C. Criollo A. Jones A.W. Kepp O. Galluzzi L. Joza N. Vitale I. Morselli E. Tailler M. et al.The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor regulates autophagy through its interaction with Beclin 1.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) does not account for autophagy induction by InsP3R inhibition. Rather, these results demonstrate that the Ca2+ release activity of InsP3R is necessary for autophagy suppression. DT40-WT and DT40-KO cells were stably transfected with the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2), an InsP3R-related Ca2+ channel expressed in cardiac myocytes, brain neurons, and elsewhere (Fill and Copello, 2002Fill M. Copello J.A. Ryanodine receptor calcium release channels.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Caffeine triggered Ca2+ release (Figure S2F) whereas nontransfected cells failed to respond (not shown). Nevertheless, RyR2 expression was without effect on constitutive autophagy in KO cells (Figure 2F and Figure S2G). Thus, Ca2+ release specifically through InsP3R regulates autophagy in normal nutrient-rich conditions. Autophagy can be activated by insufficient nutrient uptake (Nicklin et al., 2009Nicklin P. Bergman P. Zhang B. Triantafellow E. Wang H. Nyfeler B. Yang H. Hild M. Kung C. Wilson C. et al.Bidirectional transport of amino acids regulates mTOR and autophagy.Cell. 2009; 136: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). DT40-KO cells reduced glucose in the medium by 67% (20 ± 0.2 to 6.6 ± 0.3 mM/l) in 24 hr, whereas WT cells decreased it by 50% (20 ± 0.02 to 10 ± 0.01 mM/l) (Figure 3A ). Similarly, KO cells reduced glutamine by 75% (2.37 ± 0.07 to 0.6 ± 0.01 mM/l), whereas WT cells reduced it by 56% (2.31 ± 0.05 to 1 ± 0.07 mM/l) (Figure 3B). WT and KO cells had similar rates of cytochalasin-B-sensitive deoxyglucose uptake (Figure 3C). Thus, autophagy activation in the absence of InsP3R is not caused by diminished nutrient uptake. Viability was similar in KO (90.3% ± 1.7%) and WT (92.1% ± 2%) cells (Figure 3D), suggesting that autophagy in KO cells was not accelerating cell death. To evaluate a role in survival, autophagy was inhibited by pharmacological and genetic means. 3MA reduced viability of KO cells (48.3% ± 7% viable), whereas it had significantly less effect on WT cells (78.2% ± 2.1%; p < 0.001; Figure 3D). Effects on WT cell viability are consistent with an important housekeeping function of low-level basal autophagy (Levine and Kroemer, 2008Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar). Treatment with XeB (5 μM for 24 hr) killed 38% ± 3% of autophagy-deficient primary hepatocytes from Atg5 knockout mice compared with 1% ± 0.7% of littermate control cells (Figure 3G). At 48 hr, 65% ± 2.5% of the Atg5-deficient cells died, compared with 17% ± 0.8% of control cells. These results indicate that enhanced autophagy provides a survival mechanism. Consistent with this, when cells were subjected to acute nutrient deprivation by incubation in Hank's medium (24 hr), DT40-KO cells were resistant to death (78.2% ± 2.2% survival) compared with WT cells (36.2% ± 6% survival) (Figure 3E), and this difference was suppressed by 3MA (Figure 3F). When both lines were returned to normal growth medium after 24 hr in Hank's, KO cells recovered more rapidly than WT cells (Figure 3H). Thus, autophagy is activated in InsP3R-KO cells as a prosurvival mechanism, and its chronic activation enables them to respond more rapidly and efficiently to nutrient stress, promoting their tolerance and rapid recovery when conditions improve. Autophagy is activated as a survival mechanism in response to metabolic stress associated with insufficient growth factor stimulation or nutrient availability (Lum et al., 2005Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Growth factor regulation of autophagy and cell survival in the absence of apoptosis.Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). An important mediator of this response is AMPK, a critical metabolic sensor (Hardie, 2007Hardie D.G. AMP-activated/SNF1 protein kinases: conserved guardians of cellular energy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Although DT40-KO cells do not lack growth factors or nutrients, they nevertheless display enhanced or similar nutrient uptake at the same time they depend on autophagy as a survival mechanism. We therefore examined the role of AMPK by quantifying phosphorylation of the catalytic α subunit as a marker for AMPK activity. Notably, KO cells had constitutively phosphorylated AMPK (P-AMPK) nearly 2-fold greater than in WT cells (Figure 4A ). In agreement, phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, an AMPK substrate, was also increased in KO cells (data not shown). Enhanced AMPK activity was caused by lack of InsP3R because XeB, U73122, or L-690,488 elevated P-AMPK in WT cells, notably to the same levels as in KO cells (Figure 4B, Figures S2H and S2I). Enhanced P-AMPK by XeB was also observed in primary smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes as well as in MCF-7 cells (Figures S3D–S3F). Importantly, treatment of hepatocytes with XeB increased AMP levels and the AMP:ATP ratio (Figure 4J). Elevated P-AMPK in KO cells was reduced to WT levels by expression of InsP3R-3, but not by expression of Ca2+-impermeable D2550A-InsP3R-3 (Figure 4C) or RyR-2 (Figure 4D). Thus, both prosurvival autophagy and AMPK activity are upregulated by absence of InsP3R Ca2+ release activity. Enhanced AMPK activity can induce autophagy by inhibition of mTOR (Kimball, 2006Kimball S.R. Interaction between the AMP-activated protein kinase and mTOR signaling pathways.Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2006; 38: 1958-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mTOR phosphorylation was similar in DT40-KO and DT40-WT cells (Figure 4E). Furthermore, XeB did not affect P-mTOR in WT cells (Figure 4E), in contrast to its effects on autophagy and P-AMPK. Similarly, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 or p70S6K, two mTOR substrates, was similar in KO and WT cells and unchanged in WT cells exposed to XeB (Figures 4F and 4G). In contrast, P-p70S6K was reduced by starvation or rapamycin (Figure S2J), confirming that mTOR activity is normal in these cells. Thus, autophagy induced by lack of InsP3R activity correlates with enhanced AMPK activity, but the mTOR pathway does not appear to be involved. To determine if AMPK nevertheless links lack of InsP3R Ca2+ release to autophagy activation, we employed pharmacological and genetic approaches. Treatment with the AMPK inhibitor compound C reduced P-AMPK (Figure 4I) and LC3-II (Figure 4H) in KO cells. This suggests that AMPK acts upstream and is required for autophagy activation in response to loss of InsP3R activity. To confirm this, we used HEK293 cells stably expressing either a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible dominant-negative α1-AMPK (HEK-K45R), WT α1-AMPK (HEK-WT), or the empty vector (HEK-EV) (Hallows et al., 2009Hallows K.R. Alzamora R. Li H. Gong F. Smolak C. Neumann D. Pastor-Soler N.M.

https://openalex.org/W2135009079,"Obesity induced in mice by high-fat feeding activates the protein kinase Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) in adipose tissues. This results in phosphorylation of the nuclear receptor PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ), a dominant regulator of adipogenesis and fat cell gene expression, at serine 273. This modification of PPARγ does not alter its adipogenic capacity, but leads to dysregulation of a large number of genes whose expression is altered in obesity, including a reduction in the expression of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin. The phosphorylation of PPARγ by Cdk5 is blocked by anti-diabetic PPARγ ligands, such as rosiglitazone and MRL24. This inhibition works both in vivo and in vitro, and is completely independent of classical receptor transcriptional agonism. Similarly, inhibition of PPARγ phosphorylation in obese patients by rosiglitazone is very tightly associated with the anti-diabetic effects of this drug. All these findings strongly suggest that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARγ may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistance, and present an opportunity for development of an improved generation of anti-diabetic drugs through PPARγ. Thiazolidinedione antidiabetics such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are known to act through the nuclear receptor PPARγ, but some aspects of the mechanism of their insulin-sensitizing effect remain puzzling. Choi et al. now report that phosphorylation of PPARγ by Cdk5 is linked to obesity induced by high-fat feeding in mice. Several antidiabetic PPARγ ligands directly inhibit this action of Cdk5 on PPARγ, and thus support a more normal non-diabetic pattern of gene expression. In addition, inhibition of this PPARγ phosphorylation in humans by rosiglitazone is closely associated with its antidiabetic effects. This unusual pharmacology suggests a new model for a Cdk5–PPARγ link in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes, and for the therapeutic action of PPARγ ligands in these disorders as well as in metabolic syndrome, a combination of disorders that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. PPARγ ligands are used to control diabetes, but their anti-diabetic actions are puzzling. Here the authors show that phosphorylation of PPARγ by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in mice is linked to obesity induced by high-fat feeding, and that inhibition of the effect in humans by the drug rosiglitazone is closely associated with its anti-diabetic effects. Several anti-diabetic PPARγ ligands directly inhibit the effect, and thus support a more normal non-diabetic pattern of gene expression."

Bone-derived osteocalcin, in its undercarboxylated, hormonal form, regulates fat deposition and is a potent insulin secretagogue. Here, we show that insulin receptor (IR) signaling in osteoblasts controls osteoblast development and osteocalcin expression by suppressing the Runx2 inhibitor Twist2. Mice lacking IR in osteoblasts have low circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin and reduced bone acquisition due to decreased bone formation and deficient numbers of osteoblasts. With age, these mice develop marked peripheral adiposity and hyperglycemia accompanied by severe glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The metabolic abnormalities in these mice are improved by infusion of undercarboxylated osteocalcin. These results indicate the existence of a bone-pancreas endocrine loop through which insulin signaling in the osteoblast ensures osteoblast differentiation and stimulates osteocalcin production, which in turn regulates insulin sensitivity and pancreatic insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1968717432,"DNA methylation at proximal promoters facilitates lineage restriction by silencing cell type-specific genes. However, euchromatic DNA methylation frequently occurs in regions outside promoters. The functions of such nonproximal promoter DNA methylation are unclear. Here we show that the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is expressed in postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) and is required for neurogenesis. Genome-wide analysis of postnatal NSCs indicates that Dnmt3a occupies and methylates intergenic regions and gene bodies flanking proximal promoters of a large cohort of transcriptionally permissive genes, many of which encode regulators of neurogenesis. Surprisingly, Dnmt3a-dependent nonproximal promoter methylation promotes expression of these neurogenic genes by functionally antagonizing Polycomb repression. Thus, nonpromoter DNA methylation by Dnmt3a may be used for maintaining active chromatin states of genes critical for development."
https://openalex.org/W2094579758,"Climate change affects the timing of regular events of plant and animal life, such as budding, migration and hibernation, as well as population dynamics and morphology. It is difficult to monitor all these interacting factors at once, but an extended life-history study of a hibernating mammal — a yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) population in a subalpine habitat in the Upper East River Valley, Colorado — provides data suited to the task. Climate change over the period 1976–2008 has caused earlier emergence from hibernation, lengthening the animals' growing season so that they are now heavier when they start to hibernate. At the same time, the fitness of large individuals has increased, leading to a rapid increase in population size. As Marcel Visser explains in the accompanying News & Views, the major challenge in climate-change ecology is to predict the impact of future climate change on populations. This work on marmots provides the type of data needed to achieve that aim. Climate change can affect the phenology, population dynamics and morphology of species, but it is difficult to study all these factors and their interactions at once. Using long-term data for individual yellow-bellied marmots, these authors show that climate change has increased the length of the marmot growing season, leading to a gradual increase in individual size. It has simultaneously increased the fitness of large individuals, leading to a rapid increase in population size. Environmental change has altered the phenology, morphological traits and population dynamics of many species1,2. However, the links underlying these joint responses remain largely unknown owing to a paucity of long-term data and the lack of an appropriate analytical framework3. Here we investigate the link between phenotypic and demographic responses to environmental change using a new methodology and a long-term (1976–2008) data set from a hibernating mammal (the yellow-bellied marmot) inhabiting a dynamic subalpine habitat. We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments4,5."
https://openalex.org/W2094037121,"Learning new action sequences subserves a plethora of different abilities such as escaping a predator, playing the piano, or producing fluent speech. Proper initiation and termination of each action sequence is critical for the organization of behaviour, and is compromised in nigrostriatal disorders like Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases. Using a self-paced operant task in which mice learn to perform a particular sequence of actions to obtain an outcome, we found neural activity in nigrostriatal circuits specifically signalling the initiation or the termination of each action sequence. This start/stop activity emerged during sequence learning, was specific for particular actions, and did not reflect interval timing, movement speed or action value. Furthermore, genetically altering the function of striatal circuits disrupted the development of start/stop activity and selectively impaired sequence learning. These results have important implications for understanding the functional organization of actions and the sequence initiation and termination impairments observed in basal ganglia disorders. When executing a behaviour, appropriate initiation and termination of the action sequence is vital; this process is compromised in nigrostriatal disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. The neural mechanisms that underlie the learning and execution of a fixed behavioural pattern are not well understood, but Xin Jin and Rui Costa reveal start/stop neuronal activation patterns in basal ganglia circuits that emerge during task training. Mice can learn to perform a self-paced sequence of a set number of repetitive actions — lever pressing for a sucrose reward — very precisely. Using this task, Jin and Costa found that many neurons in nigrostriatal circuits can selectively signal the self-initiation or self-termination of each executed sequence. Genetic alteration of these circuits disrupted the start/stop activity and impaired performance, providing evidence for a causal relationship between the specific neuronal activity and task learning. The appropriate initiation and termination of behavioural action sequences is imperative, but the neural mechanisms underlying the learning and execution of fixed behavioural patterns are poorly understood. Here the authors reveal start/stop neuronal activity in basal ganglia circuits that emerge during task training in mice. Genetically altering these circuits disrupted the activity and impaired performance, providing evidence for a causal relationship between the specific neuronal activity and task learning."
https://openalex.org/W2133929470,"Peatlands, soils and the ocean floor are well-recognized as sites of organic carbon accumulation and represent important global carbon sinks. Although the annual burial of organic carbon in lakes and reservoirs exceeds that of ocean sediments, these inland waters are components of the global carbon cycle that receive only limited attention. Of the organic carbon that is being deposited onto the sediments, a certain proportion will be mineralized and the remainder will be buried over geological timescales. Here we assess the relationship between sediment organic carbon mineralization and temperature in a cross-system survey of boreal lakes in Sweden, and with input from a compilation of published data from a wide range of lakes that differ with respect to climate, productivity and organic carbon source. We find that the mineralization of organic carbon in lake sediments exhibits a strongly positive relationship with temperature, which suggests that warmer water temperatures lead to more mineralization and less organic carbon burial. Assuming that future organic carbon delivery to the lake sediments will be similar to that under present-day conditions, we estimate that temperature increases following the latest scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change could result in a 4-27 per cent (0.9-6.4 Tg C yr(-1)) decrease in annual organic carbon burial in boreal lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2067327084,"Pathogens of plants and animals produce effector proteins that are transferred into the cytoplasm of host cells to suppress host defenses. One type of plant pathogens, oomycetes, produces effector proteins with N-terminal RXLR and dEER motifs that enable entry into host cells. We show here that effectors of another pathogen type, fungi, contain functional variants of the RXLR motif, and that the oomycete and fungal RXLR motifs enable binding to the phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P). We find that PI3P is abundant on the outer surface of plant cell plasma membranes and, furthermore, on some animal cells. All effectors could also enter human cells, suggesting that PI3P-mediated effector entry may be very widespread in plant, animal and human pathogenesis. Entry into both plant and animal cells involves lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. Blocking PI3P binding inhibited effector entry, suggesting new therapeutic avenues."

This variability in clinical response to RA is enigmatic, as no mutations in components of the RA signaling cascade have been found. Using a large-scale RNAi genetic screen, we identify crosstalk between the tumor suppressor NF1 and retinoic acid-induced differentiation in neuroblastoma. Loss of NF1 activates RAS-MEK signaling, which in turn represses ZNF423, a critical transcriptional coactivator of the retinoic acid receptors. Neuroblastomas with low levels of both NF1 and ZNF423 have extremely poor outcome. We find NF1 mutations in neuroblastoma cell lines and in primary tumors. Inhibition of MEK signaling downstream of NF1 restores responsiveness to RA, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to overcome RA resistance in NF1-deficient neuroblastomas.PaperClip/cms/asset/ecd13f94-5fd9-4970-b576-4a8e66a42072/mmc4.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.65 MB) Download audio"

They verified that Born holds true—that the interference pattern is built up by the interference from two paths, and two paths only, with no higher-order paths interfering.

https://openalex.org/W2005083925,"Human telomeres are protected from DNA damage by a nucleoprotein complex that includes the repeat-binding factor TRF2. Here, we report that TRF2 regulates the 5' exonuclease activity of its binding partner, Apollo, a member of the metallo-beta-lactamase family that is required for telomere integrity during S phase. TRF2 and Apollo also suppress damage to engineered interstitial telomere repeat tracts that were inserted far away from chromosome ends. Genetic data indicate that DNA topoisomerase 2alpha acts in the same pathway of telomere protection as TRF2 and Apollo. Moreover, TRF2, which binds preferentially to positively supercoiled DNA substrates, together with Apollo, negatively regulates the amount of TOP1, TOP2alpha, and TOP2beta at telomeres. Our data are consistent with a model in which TRF2 and Apollo relieve topological stress during telomere replication. Our work also suggests that cellular senescence may be caused by topological problems that occur during the replication of the inner portion of telomeres."

We have previously described that the promoters of adipogenic genes display significant levels of dimethylation at the Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4) in preadipocytes, where these genes are still silenced, thus maintaining the chromatin of the precursor cell in a receptive state. Here, we show that the expression of several histone demethylases and methyltransferases increases during adipogenesis, suggesting an important role for these proteins in this process. Knockdown of the H3K4/K9 demethylase LSD1 results in markedly decreased differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This outcome is associated with decreased H3K4 dimethylation and increased H3K9 dimethylation at the promoter of transcription factor cebpa, whose expression must be induced >200-fold upon stimulation of differentiation. Thus, our data suggest that LSD1 acts to maintain a permissive state of the chromatin in this promoter by opposing the action of a H3K9 methyltransferase. Knockdown of H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 produced the opposite results, by decreasing H3K9 dimethylation and increasing H3K4 dimethylation levels at the cebpa promoter and favoring differentiation.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of epigenetic mechanisms in adipogenesis (for review, see 24Musri M.M. Gomis R. Párrizas M. Organogenesis. 2010; 6: 14-23Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, we described a role for histone H3K4 dimethylation in labeling specific adipocyte genes such as apm1 as “poised” for transcription in undifferentiated fibroblasts that do not yet express them (25Musri M.M. Corominola H. Casamitjana R. Gomis R. Párrizas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17180-17188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, the essential role of histone methylation in adipogenesis has been confirmed by two independent studies. Targeted deletion in mice of the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL3 results in drastically decreased adipose tissue, even under a high fat diet (26Lee J. Saha P.K. Yang Q.H. Lee S. Park J.Y. Suh Y. Lee S.K. Chan L. Roeder R.G. Lee J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19229-19234Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas disruption of the gene encoding the H3K9 demethylase JMJD1A results in obesity (27Tateishi K. Okada Y. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Nature. 2009; 458: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These data emphasize the active role of histone methylation in the development of adipocytes from undifferentiated cells. In the present study, we evaluate how the expression levels of different HDMs and HMTs are regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we show that expression of HDM LSD1 is necessary for adipogenesis to proceed adequately. LSD1 participates in the regulation of adipogenic transcription factor cebpa by decreasing H3K9 dimethylation and maintaining H3K4 dimethylation at its promoter, opposing the function of H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1. Taken together, these results indicate that histone methylation plays a key role in the regulation of the transcription of key adipogenic genes during adipogenesis and consequently in the differentiation process itself. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Sigma) and 10T1/2 pluripotent fibroblasts were grown in Basal Medium Eagle supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 and 10T1/2 cells to adipocytes was induced by treatment of confluent cells (designated day 0, D0) with an adipogenic mixture consisting of 850 nm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine in the presence of 10% FBS (all reagents from Sigma). The differentiation medium was replaced 2 days later (D2) with medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 850 nm insulin. After 3 more days in insulin-containing medium (D5), the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS without further supplements. Isolation of mouse preadipocytes, in vitro differentiation, and transfection of D5 adipocytes are discussed in supplemental Methods. For RNA analysis and Oil Red O staining, 3T3-L1 or 10T1/2 fibroblasts were trypsinized 1 h before transfection and distributed into 24-well plates (7–8 × 104 cells/well). For ChIP assays or nuclear extract preparation, 2 × 106 cells were plated in a 100-mm dish 1 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 60 nm corresponding double-stranded siRNAs using Metafectene Pro (Biontex, Martinsried, Germany) at a 1:3 (w:v) ratio with the siRNA. Two different siRNAs for each target were used. Sequence details are presented in supplemental Table 1. When required, cell differentiation was started when the transfected cells reached confluence, usually 48–72 h after transfection. Otherwise, RNA was extracted at 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection. For Western blotting and ChIP assays, cells were used 72 h after transfection. Intracellular triglyceride was stained with Oil Red O (Sigma). Briefly, cells were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with 60% isopropyl alcohol, and stained with Oil Red O solution (0.21% Oil Red O in 60% isopropyl alcohol) for 1 h at room temperature. Excess stain was removed with 60% isopropyl alcohol, and cells were washed extensively with tap water before being photographed under a light microscope (magnification, ×400). Nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 cells were prepared as described (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The primary antibodies were diluted 1/1,000 in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl) supplemented with 5% nonfat milk and visualized by blotting with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was detected using the ECL Plus reagents (GE Healthcare), in a LAS3000 Lumi-Imager (Fuji Photo Film Inc., Valhalla, NY). Antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Random-primed cDNA synthesis was performed at 37 °C starting with 0.5 μg of RNA, using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was measured by real time PCR in an ABI Prism 7900HT Real Time PCR system using TaqMan FAM-labeled specific probes (Applied Biosystems). A list of the probes used is presented in supplemental Table 2. Results were normalized to actb expression. Statistical differences were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test using the mean ± S.D. calculated from three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Dimethyl and trimethyl H3K4 ChIP assays were performed as described (25Musri M.M. Corominola H. Casamitjana R. Gomis R. Párrizas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17180-17188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Musri M.M. Gomis R. Párrizas M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 456: 231-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Dimethyl H3K9, LSD1, and SETDB1 ChIP assays were performed using the EpiQuik chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Epigentek, Brooklyn, NY) following the instructions of the manufacturer. All antibodies used were from Upstate Biotechnology. ChIP assays were analyzed by real time PCR using TaqMan specific primers and FAM-labeled probes designed to amplify segments located in a region of approximately 500 bp around the transcription initiation site of selected genes for analysis of promoter regions (see supplemental Table 3). Results shown are the mean ± S.D. calculated from three independent ChIP experiments performed in duplicate. Statistical differences were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test. On a previous work (25Musri M.M. Corominola H. Casamitjana R. Gomis R. Párrizas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17180-17188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) we showed that adipogenic genes such as the hormone adiponectin (apm1) display significant levels of H3K4 dimethylation on their promoter regions in preadipocytes. We proposed that this epigenetic signal, usually associated with actively transcribed genes (3Pokholok D.K. Harbison C.T. Levine S. Cole M. Hannett N.M. Lee T.I. Bell G.W. Walker K. Rolfe P.A.

Erlich R.L. Schneider R. Bouman P. Liu J.S. Kouzarides T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8695-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), labels those still silenced genes as poised to be expressed once the cells are induced to differentiate. To build on this information, we used ChIP to analyze those same promoters for the presence of H3K9 dimethylation, a mark usually associated with silent chromatin, in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (D0), cells in the early stages of the differentiation process (D2), and mature adipocytes (D7). Our data show that, in addition to H3K4 dimethylation (Fig. 1, upper panel), adipogenic genes such as apm1 or cebpa, encoding transcription factor C/EBPα, one of the master regulators of adipogenesis, display significant levels of H3K9 dimethylation on their promoters in D0 preadipocytes (Fig. 1, lower panel). In contrast, the promoter of the silent muscle-specific gene myod1 displays high levels of H3K9 dimethylation throughout adipogenesis, but no detectable H3K4 dimethylation was observed. On the other hand, high H3K4 dimethylation levels, but not H3K9 dimethylation, were easily detected on the promoter of the constitutively active and heavily expressed actb gene during differentiation. Thus, adipogenic genes in preadipocytes exhibit characteristics shared with both inactive (H3K9 dimethylation) and active (H3K4 dimethylation) genes. Moreover, H3K4 and H3K9 dimethylation follow inverse patterns throughout differentiation on those promoters, with H3K4 dimethylation significantly increasing at the time that the expression of the genes increases (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1), and H3K9 dimethylation decreasing, reaching background levels in mature adipocytes (D7), where those genes are highly expressed. Conversely, the promoter of dlk1, a gene that follows an inverse pattern of expression to apm1 or cebpa, being highly expressed in preadipocytes and progressively silenced throughout adipogenesis, displays high levels of H3K4 dimethylation but undetectable H3K9 dimethylation in 3T3-L1 D0 fibroblasts. During adipogenesis, mirroring the silencing of the gene, H3K4 dimethylation gradually decreases whereas H3K9 dimethylation increases at the dlk1 promoter, thus leaving a bivalent H3K4/K9 dimethylation mark on the silenced promoter in mature adipocytes (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). The observed regulated pattern of histone modifications in correlation with gene expression changes of key adipogenic genes suggests an important role for histone methylation on the regulation of adipogenesis. Thus, we set out to study the expression of some of the enzymes involved in the regulation of histone methylation turnover in preadipocytes and differentiating cells. Gene expression levels measured by real time RT-PCR in 3T3-L1 cells at different days during the differentiation process show a significant increase of a number of HDMs (Fig. 2A) and HMTs (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern of gene expression was observed in mouse primary preadipocytes at different days during in vitro differentiation (supplemental Fig. 2). LSD1 was initially described as a H3K4 demethylase, therefore functioning as a transcriptional repressor (8Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3044) Google Scholar), but it was later linked to gene activation depending on the chromatin context and its associated partners (19Metzger E. Wissmann M. Yin N. Müller J.M. Schneider R. Peters A.H. Günther T. Buettner R. Schüle R. Nature. 2005; 437: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 20Garcia-Bassets I. Kwon Y.S. Telese F. Prefontaine G.G. Hutt K.R. Cheng C.S. Ju B.G. Ohgi K.A. Wang J. Escoubet-Lozach L. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Fu X.D. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2007; 128: 505-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), thus establishing its dual nature as a H3K4/K9 demethylase. Because we were interested in studying the impact of modifying the levels of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation during adipogenesis, we knocked down the expression of lsd1 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts by transient transfection of a specific siRNA duplex. Two different siRNAs were used to confirm the results. Lsd1 gene expression was blocked with high efficiency until at least 120 h after transfection, as measured by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). LSD1 protein expression was almost undetectable in siLsd1-transfected cells by Western blotting 72 h after transfection (Fig. 3A, inset). To investigate the role of LSD1 in adipogenesis, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with either siLsd1 or a control scrambled siRNA (siC) were stimulated to differentiate under normal conditions. Differentiation was allowed to proceed until D7, and mature adipocytes were identified under light microscopy by Oil Red O staining, which specifically dyes lipid droplets. Lipid accumulation, a distinctive feature of adipocyte differentiation, was effectively decreased in lsd1-knocked down cells with respect to controls (Fig. 3B). To confirm this decrease in adipocyte differentiation, expression of genes specific of mature adipocytes was also analyzed. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected and differentiated as usual. Total RNA was extracted at D5, and expression of adipogenic genes was measured by real time RT-PCR. A significant decrease in the hormones apm1, leptin, and retn, as well as the lipid transporter fabp4 and glucose transporter glut4 was observed in D5 siLsd1 cells compared with controls (Fig. 3C). To check whether the effect of knocking down lsd1 on adipogenesis was restricted to the 3T3-L1 cell line or was on the contrary a more general phenomenon, we performed the same experiments on the pluripotent mouse cell line C3H 10T1/2. These cells are pluripotent fibroblasts that can be differentiated into adipocytes, chondrocytes, or myocytes (30Taylor S.M. Jones P.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 771-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Indeed, low passage C3H 10T/2 cells could be easily differentiated into mature adipocytes under standard conditions, but adipogenesis was significantly decreased after siLsd1 transfection (Fig. 3B). Thus, our data indicate that lsd1 expression is needed for adipogenesis both in already committed 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and in pluripotent C3H 10T1/2 fibroblasts. To identify possible LSD1 target genes, we used real time RT-PCR to analyze the expression of a number of genes involved in the regulation of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells transfected with either siC or siLsd1 and stimulated to differentiate. Interestingly, expression of some of the leading adipogenic transcription factors was altered in D0 preadipocytes (Fig. 3D). However, this effect was not seen when we transfected already mature adipocytes at D5 (supplemental Fig. 3). This lack of an effect in differentiated cells is not due to deficient transfection of mature adipocytes because lsd1 mRNA levels were decreased to an extent similar to that observed in D0 siLsd1 cells (supplemental Fig. 3B). In D0 lsd1-knocked down preadipocytes, expression of cebpa was significantly decreased (Fig. 3D, inset), whereas expression of cebpb was increased. Expression of pparg and foxo1, on the other hand, was not significantly modified at 48 h after transfection, although transient significant changes could be detected at other time points (supplemental Fig. 3D). However, the studied transcription factors failed to be induced upon stimulation of adipogenesis in lsd1-knocked down cells, so that in mature cells at D3 or D5, the expression of cebpa, pparg, and foxO1 was much decreased compared with control siC-transfected cells (Fig. 3D). The expression of cebpb, on the other hand, is only limitedly induced during adipogenesis and was not affected by lsd1 knockdown (Fig. 3D). The dramatic decrease of cebpa expression observed in siLsd1-transfected cells at D0 may explain at least in part the observed effect on adipogenesis because C/EBPα is one of the master regulators of this process, and cebpa−/− mice lack white adipose tissue in many depots (31Linhart H.G. Ishimura-Oka K. DeMayo F. Kibe T. Repka D. Poindexter B. Bick R.J. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the histone methylation status of the cebpa promoter in control and siLsd1-transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Interestingly, ChIP assays demonstrate that H3K4 dimethylation was significantly decreased at the cebpa promoter 72 h after siLsd1 transfection with respect to the control. In contrast, H3K9 dimethylation in the same region was increased (Fig. 4A). As a control, H3K4 and H3K9 dimethylation at the actb and myod promoters, respectively, did not show significant changes (Fig. 4A). The increase of H3K9 dimethylation in absence of LSD1 would indicate a more repressive status of the chromatin and correlates with the observed silencing of the gene. Similar to what we had previously described for other adipogenic genes (25Musri M.M. Corominola H. Casamitjana R. Gomis R. Párrizas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17180-17188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the cebpa promoter does not display detectable H3K4 trimethylation in D0 preadipocytes (data not shown). However, this epigenetic signal, usually associated with gene activity, increases steadily throughout differentiation at adipogenic promoters, reaching maximum levels in mature cells, when expression of the genes is maximal (25Musri M.M. Corominola H. Casamitjana R. Gomis R. Párrizas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17180-17188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To study whether this programmed enrichment of H3K4 trimethylation was affected by knocking down lsd1, we transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and proceeded to differentiation as usual. At D2, cells were harvested and used for ChIP assays. Our data show that in siLsd1 cells, H3K4 trimethylation at the promoter of cebpa remains undetectable (Fig. 4B). In contrast, siC cells at D2 display significant levels of H3K4. These results are in accordance with the observed lack of induction of the gene (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our data suggest that in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes LSD1 is acting as an activator on the cepba promoter by maintaining low levels of dimethylated H3K9, probably opposing the function of a H3K9 methyltransferase. Maintenance of H3K9 dimethylation at this basal level is a prerequisite for the fast and robust induction of the gene that takes place after adipogenesis is induced."

Such induction of autophagy by As(2)O(3) appears to require activation of the MEK/ERK pathway but not the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin or JNK pathways. In efforts to understand the functional relevance of arsenic-induced autophagy, we found that pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy or molecular targeting of beclin 1 or Atg7 results in reversal of the suppressive effects of As(2)O(3) on leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic progenitors from acute myelogenous leukemia patients. Altogether, our data provide direct evidence that autophagic cell death is critical for the generation of the effects of As(2)O(3) on acute myelogenous leukemia cells and raise the potential of modulation of elements of the autophagic machinery as an approach to enhance the antitumor properties of As(2)O(3) and possibly other heavy metal derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2081999578,"Obesity is an epidemic problem affecting millions of people in the Western hemisphere and costs the United States economy more than $200 billion annually. Currently, there are no effective treatments to combat obesity. Recent studies have implicated the constitutive activity of estrogen receptor (ER) β as an important regulator of metabolic diseases. However, the potential of ER-β-selective ligands to offset obesity is not clear. We evaluated the pharmacological effect of ER-β-selective ligands (β-LGNDs) in animal models of high-fat diet- and ovariectomy-induced obesity. Ligand binding, transactivation, and uterotrophic studies with β-LGNDs demonstrated selectivity for ER-β over ER-α. Animals fed a high-fat diet showed a significant increase in body weight, and this weight gain was attenuated by β-LGNDs. High-fat diet-mediated increases in serum cholesterol, leptin, glucose, and fat accumulation in organs were also reduced by β-LGNDs. In addition, MRI scanning indicated that β-LGNDs altered body composition by reducing fat mass and increasing lean body mass. Organ weights and gene expression analyses demonstrated that adipose tissue is the center of action for β-LGNDs, and the reduction in body weight is likely due to increased energy expenditure. In vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies indicated that the anti-obesity effects of β-LGNDs were due to indirect peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ antagonistic actions requiring the ligand binding domain of ER-β and through abrogation of the ability of PGC-1 to coactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. In conclusion, these studies indicate that ligand-activated ER-β is a potential therapeutic target to combat obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2094354974,"BRCC36 is a member of the JAMM/MPN(+) family of zinc metalloproteases that specifically cleaves Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro. We and others showed previously that BRCC36 is a component of the BRCA1-A complex, which consists of RAP80, CCDC98/ABRAXAS, BRCC45/BRE, MERIT40/NBA1, BRCC36, and BRCA1. This complex participates in the regulation of BRCA1 localization in response to DNA damage. Here we provide evidence indicating that BRCC36 regulates the abundance of Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chains at chromatin and that one of its substrates is diubiquitinated histone H2A. Moreover, besides interacting with CCDC98 within the BRCA1-A complex, BRCC36 also associates with another protein KIAA0157, which shares significant sequence homology with CCDC98. Interestingly, although CCDC98 functions as an adaptor of BRCC36 and regulates BRCC36 activity in the nucleus, KIAA0157 mainly localizes in cytosol and activates BRCC36 in the cytoplasm. Moreover, these two complexes appear to exist in fine balance in vivo because reduction of KIAA0157 expression led to an increase of the BRCA1-A complex in the nucleus. Together, these results suggest that scaffold proteins not only participate in the regulation of BRCC36 activity but also determine its subcellular localization and cellular functions."

A promising approach to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria uses light in combination with a photosensitizer to induce a phototoxic reaction. Concentrations of 1, 10 and 100microM of tetrahydroporphyrin-tetratosylat (THPTS) and different incubation times (30, 90 and 180min) were used to measure photodynamic efficiency against two Gram-positive strains of S.aureus (MSSA and MRSA), and two Gram-negative strains of E.coli and P.aeruginosa. We found that phototoxicity of the drug is independent of the antibiotic resistance pattern when incubated in PBS for the investigated strains. Also, an incubation with 100microM THPTS followed by illumination, yielded a 6lg (> or =99.999%) decrease in the viable numbers of all bacteria strains tested, indicating that the THPTS drug has a high degree of photodynamic inactivation. We then modulated incubation time, photosensitizer concentration and monitored the effect of serum on the THPTS activity.

https://openalex.org/W2042513100,"Crossovers between meiotic homologs are crucial for their proper segregation, and crossover number and position are carefully controlled. Crossover homeostasis in budding yeast maintains crossovers at the expense of noncrossovers when double-strand DNA break (DSB) frequency is reduced. The mechanism of maintaining constant crossover levels in other species has been unknown. Here we investigate in fission yeast a different aspect of crossover control—the near invariance of crossover frequency per kb of DNA despite large variations in DSB intensity across the genome. Crossover invariance involves the choice of sister chromatid versus homolog for DSB repair. At strong DSB hotspots, intersister repair outnumbers interhomolog repair ∼3:1, but our genetic and physical data indicate the converse in DSB-cold regions. This unanticipated mechanism of crossover control may operate in many species and explain, for example, the large excess of DSBs over crossovers and the repair of DSBs on unpaired chromosomes in diverse species."

Surprisingly, we discover that BRCC36 DUB activity requires different interactions within the context of each complex. Abraxas and BRCC45 were essential for BRCC36 DUB activity within the RAP80 complex, whereas KIAA0157/Abro was the only interaction required for DUB activity within the BRISC. Poh1 also required protein interactions for activity, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism for JAMM domain DUBs. Finally, BRISC deficiency enhanced formation of the BRCA1-RAP80 complex in vivo, increasing BRCA1 levels at DNA double strand breaks. These findings reveal that JAMM domain DUB activity and K63-Ub levels are regulated by multiple mechanisms within the cell."

Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a prospective study, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profiles of whole blood cells from 48 matched Cambodian children: 19 progressed to DSS while 16 and 13 presented respectively classical dengue fever (DF) or dengue hemorrhagic fever grades I/II (DHF). Using multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and adjustment of p-values to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR<10%), we identified a signature of 2959 genes differentiating DSS patients from both DF and DHF, and showed a strong association of this DSS-gene signature with the dengue disease phenotype. Using a combined approach to analyse the molecular patterns associated with the DSS-gene signature, we provide an integrative overview of the transcriptional responses altered in DSS children. In particular, we show that the transcriptome of DSS children blood cells is characterized by a decreased abundance of transcripts related to T and NK lymphocyte responses and by an increased abundance of anti-inflammatory and repair/remodeling transcripts. We also show that unexpected pro-inflammatory gene patterns at the interface between innate immunity, inflammation and host lipid metabolism, known to play pathogenic roles in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with systemic vascular dysfunction, are transcriptionnally active in the blood cells of DSS children. Conclusions/Significance We provide a global while non exhaustive overview of the molecular mechanisms altered in of DSS children and suggest how they may interact to lead to final vascular homeostasis breakdown. We suggest that some mechanisms identified should be considered putative therapeutic targets or biomarkers of progression to DSS."

However, spores that are easily kept aloft are also rapidly decelerated in still air; thus, dispersal range depends strongly on release height. Vascular plants grow tall to lift spores into sufficient wind currents for dispersal, but nonvascular plants such as Sphagnum cannot grow sufficiently high. High-speed videos show that exploding capsules of Sphagnum generate vortex rings to efficiently carry spores high enough to be dispersed by turbulent air currents. Spores launched ballistically at similar speeds through still air would travel a few millimeters and not easily reach turbulent air. Vortex rings are used by animals; here, we report vortex rings generated by plants."

Such geometry-sensing mechanisms control both the decision to enter into cell division and the physical orientation of the chromosome segregation machinery, suggesting that signals controlling cell division may be linked to the mechanisms that ensure proper chromosome segregation. Single-celled organisms monitor cell geometry and use this information to control cell division. Such geometry-sensing mechanisms control both the decision to enter into cell division and the physical orientation of the chromosome segregation machinery, suggesting that signals controlling cell division may be linked to the mechanisms that ensure proper chromosome segregation. How cells coordinate growth and division is an important problem for cell and developmental biology. Cell size and shape impact the cell division process because chromosomes and other cellular components must be properly segregated within a confined space. As cells grow and progress toward division, a series of checkpoints ensure that cells do not prematurely undergo cell-cycle transitions such as entry into S phase or mitosis. Cell-cycle studies have revealed the existence of cell size checkpoints that link cell-cycle transitions with the attainment of critical cell size thresholds. These observations raise a number of questions, including “what is size?” and “how is size measured?” Work in a number of single-celled organisms has led to the idea that cell geometry may have a role in the assessment of size and how size relates to the cell-cycle checkpoints that operate during chromosome segregation and division. In this Essay, we examine the evidence and emerging themes that surround geometry-sensing mechanisms in two well-studied model systems: bacteria and yeast. We suggest that the role of geometry in controlling cell-cycle decisions at division may be linked to the role of cell geometry in physically guiding chromosome segregation in these organisms. This raises the possibility that cell-cycle controls over entry into mitosis may be linked to the mechanisms that ensure proper execution of mitosis and cytokinesis. Connections between cell geometry and cell division have been well described in several bacterial species, providing a good framework for understanding the general design principles of geometry-sensing mechanisms. In these bacterial cells, division occurs in the cell middle due to locally restricted assembly of the cytokinetic Z-ring composed of tubulin-like FtsZ. Two mechanisms prevent Z-ring assembly at the cell ends, thus incorporating geometric information into the division process. The first is in the bacterium Escherichia coli and uses a self-organized oscillator comprised of the MinCDE proteins. The second mechanism requires a self-assembled filament network that senses membrane curvature and is found in both Bacillus subtilis and Caulobacter crescentus. These two systems both inhibit division at the cell ends and demonstrate that mechanisms based on quite different molecular components can integrate geometric information with cell division. The MinCDE system is a remarkable geometry-measuring oscillator, the mechanism of which has been elucidated using a combination of elegant experimental and computational approaches. In this three-component system, MinC inhibits the assembly of tubulin-like FtsZ, MinD recruits MinC to the cell membrane, and MinE controls intracellular organization of MinCD (for reviews see Lutkenhaus, 2007Lutkenhaus J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 539-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, Lutkenhaus, 2008Lutkenhaus J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 641: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The interaction of MinD and MinE generates oscillatory behavior in which MinCD migrates back and forth between the two cell poles (Raskin and de Boer, 1997Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These oscillations lead to a time-averaged polar gradient, in which the lowest levels of the FtsZ inhibitor are found in the cell middle, thus linking cell shape with assembly of its division apparatus (Figure 1). The ability of this system to assess cell geometry predicts changes in its behavior upon alterations to cell size and shape. As such, when cell division is inhibited to generate long bacterial filaments, the MinCDE system appears in vertical stripes along the length of the cell, suggesting the establishment of defined geometric domains (Raskin and de Boer, 1997Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As in wild-type cells, the MinCDE stripes are dynamic but move in a coordinated manner consistent with a single signal leading to organized behavior. Moreover, MinCDE can also oscillate in rounded cells and thus does not depend on the rod-like shape of wild-type cells (Corbin et al., 2002Corbin B.D. Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the MinCDE oscillator provides a read-out of cell geometry, and computational modeling has revealed the potential for these oscillations to result from the self-organization of the three components without the need for additional signals (Kruse et al., 2007Kruse K. Howard M. Margolin W. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Lutkenhaus, 2007Lutkenhaus J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 539-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, cell geometry acts as a guide for a self-organized oscillator that then provides a read-out for controlling cell division. The investigative approach used here, which combines experimental understanding of the molecular components with the generation of computational models, provides a good approach for studies of other geometry-sensing mechanisms. This ability to link cell geometry and cell division is not unique to E. coli, and investigations of other bacterial cell types have revealed alternative strategies that achieve the same goal. Geometry sensing in B. subtilis and C. crescentus shares a three-component design principle despite using different proteins. The three key features of these systems are (1) a self-assembling filament anchor at cell ends, (2) an inhibitor of FtsZ, and (3) a molecular adaptor (Figure 1). Mounting evidence suggests that the filament anchors can target the cell ends by preferentially interacting with negatively curved membranes, a notion that is reinforced by their assembly at cell ends when ectopically expressed in other cell types (Bowman et al., 2008Bowman G.R.

This suggests a key role for membrane curvature in the organization of cell division control systems, with several such curvature-sensing mechanisms recently proposed (Lenarcic et al., 2009Lenarcic R.

In these organisms, adaptor proteins tether the chromosome to the cell pole while also providing the molecular link between the filament anchors and the inhibitors of FtsZ (Bowman et al., 2008Bowman G.R.

Cell. 2006; 126: 147-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). B. subtilis uses the same FtsZ inhibitor as E. coli despite different “input” signals related to cell geometry (Marston et al., 1998Marston A.L. Thomaides H.B. Edwards D.H. Sharpe M.E. Errington J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3419-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Here, we focus on the role of B. subtilis MinCD at the cell poles for comparison with other geometry-sensing mechanisms, but this protein complex also targets the late division site in a mechanism proposed to prevent Z-ring assembly near existing division septa (Gregory et al., 2008Gregory J.A. Becker E.C. Pogliano K. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3475-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In C. crescentus, the FtsZ inhibitor is MipZ, which forms a polarized gradient from the cell ends (Thanbichler and Shapiro, 2006Thanbichler M. Shapiro L. Cell. 2006; 126: 147-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Gradients may be a common theme in geometry-sensing mechanisms to generate controls that are adaptable to changes in cell size and shape. These examples illustrate the point that common design principles may have evolved in organisms that use distinct sets of molecular players. These prokaryote examples indicate that cells can monitor their geometry and use this information to generate temporal and spatial control over cell division. But do such mechanisms operate in eukaryotes? Experimental evidence suggests links between cell size and cell division in eukaryotes, but do similar themes and design principles apply? Work from fission and budding yeast indicates that eukaryotic cells possess size-sensing mechanisms linked to controls over cell-cycle transitions, including entry into mitosis. Central to this mitotic control system in fission yeast is the ubiquitous cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1, which drives entry into mitosis by phosphorylating a wide range of targets, and its inhibitor Wee1, which phosphorylates and inhibits Cdk1 to prevent precocious entry into mitosis (Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004Jorgensen P. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1014-R1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, Rupes, 2002Rupes I. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Fission yeast cells are cylindrical and grow in a polarized manner at their tips while maintaining a constant cell width, and this regular cell shape suggests that size-monitoring mechanisms could also involve cell geometry. Mutations in the Cdk1 control system suggest that cells must reach a defined length to trigger mitotic entry, but the mechanisms that link this size with Cdk1 activation are unclear. Recent studies have identified a two-part system that may link cell geometry with Cdk1 regulation (Figure 1) (Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009Martin S.G. Berthelot-Grosjean M. Nature. 2009; 459: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Moseley et al., 2009Moseley J.B. Mayeux A. Paoletti A. Nurse P. Nature. 2009; 459: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). First, a set of cortical nodes in the middle of interphase cells contains Wee1 and multiple inhibitors of Wee1, including the Wee1-inhibitory kinase Cdr2. Genetic evidence supports the notion that these nodes promote mitotic entry through negative regulation of Wee1. Second, the protein kinase Pom1 forms a polarized gradient that is enriched at cell ends and inhibits mitotic entry by negatively regulating the cortical nodes. Due to the shape of this gradient, Pom1 overlaps with the cortical nodes in small cells but not in large cells and thus appears to inhibit mitotic entry until cells reach a critical size. Pom1 also participates in additional mechanisms linking cell geometry and cell division in fission yeast by promoting assembly of the cytokinetic ring in the cell middle (Celton-Morizur et al., 2006Celton-Morizur S. Racine V. Sibarita J.B. Paoletti A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4710-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Padte et al., 2006Padte N.N. Martin S.G. Howard M. Chang F. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2480-2487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and then blocking cytokinesis at cell ends (Huang et al., 2007Huang Y. Chew T.G. Ge W. Balasubramanian M.K. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 987-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a process with intriguing similarities to regulation of the Z-ring in bacteria. This “tip occlusion” of cytokinesis becomes particularly important in small cells, where cell ends are closer together. These examples indicate that multiple steps in the fission yeast cell division process incorporate signals related to cell geometry. This fission yeast system suggests a mechanism that senses cell geometry and may contain design principles related to the bacterial examples. Approaches that elucidated the geometry-sensing mechanisms in bacteria are likely to provide a framework for answering the open questions in this eukaryotic system. For example, what aspect of size is measured by the gradient-node system? As in bacteria, experiments that examine the organization and activity of the system upon changes to cell geometry will indicate whether this mechanism reflects geometry or some other proxy related to cell size. Do the central players self-organize like the MinCDE system in E. coli, or are self-assembling anchors and adaptor proteins involved similar to the B. subtilis and C. crescentus systems? Establishment of the Pom1 gradient requires microtubules (Bahler and Pringle, 1998Bahler J. Pringle J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1356-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which self-organize into an array in fission yeast cells (Carazo-Salas and Nurse, 2006Carazo-Salas R.E. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Daga et al., 2006Daga R.R. Lee K.G. Bratman S. Salas-Pino S. Chang F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1108-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), hinting at self-organization in this system. The self-organizing principle of the MinCDE system became clear through computational models that followed from the identification and characterization of the primary components. Similar models are likely to generate new experimental approaches for understanding the fission yeast system and may suggest how the geometry of cell ends versus the cell middle can organize this gradient-node mechanism. It is possible that the ends of fission yeast cells provide an environment or curvature to organize filament anchors, as shown by the ability of the B. subtilis filament anchor DivIVA to localize at cell ends when ectopically expressed in fission yeast (Edwards et al., 2000Edwards D.H. Thomaides H.B. Errington J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This possibility suggests that geometric shapes may generate a universal signal in widely divergent organisms. Several general themes emerge from a comparison of these prokaryotic and eukaryotic geometry-sensing mechanisms. In all cases, polar inhibition is established by molecules at the cell poles that inhibit cell division and can act as sensors of cell geometry. Components that may contribute to these polar cues include self-assembling anchors, cell curvature, and the organization of phospholipids and sterols. The molecular details of these cues and their signaling pathways may vary between cell types and organisms, but the presence of conserved design principles supports the importance of studying the organization and emergent properties of these model systems. Spatial gradients also appear in each system, with the potential for adaptable control of downstream decisions. It will be important to understand how thresholds are set for these gradient-based signals, in particular for controlling mitotic entry in eukaryotic cells. Changes in these gradients and their signaling targets may also contribute to how cells respond to changes in growth conditions or nutrients, which often affect cell division (Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004Jorgensen P. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1014-R1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Ultimately, a systems-level understanding of how cell geometry directs cell division events will emerge from combining genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and computational approaches. Such progress has been successful in bacterial systems such as MinCDE and represents a key future goal for systems in eukaryotic cells such as fission yeast. The described geometry sensors act to trigger events at cell division, when chromosomal DNA must be segregated to opposite cell poles. This segregation relies on cell size and shape, as the mitotic spindle must be oriented to position chromosomes within the defined geometry of the cell. This raises the possibility that geometry sensors might serve the role of delaying cell division until cells have reached an appropriate size and shape to promote proper spindle orientation and elongation. In support of this idea, functional links between cell geometry and the DNA segregation machinery have been described in cell types that display geometry-sensing mechanisms. In fission yeast, cell geometry directs spindle orientation in two ways. During early mitosis, the initial orientation of short spindles follows the alignment of interphase microtubules, which self-organize according to cell geometry along the long axis of these cylindrical cells. At anaphase B, elongating spindles then orient according to cell geometry—the physical constraints of a cylindrical cell align the spindle along the long axis to facilitate segregation of the chromosomes to opposite poles (Daga and Nurse, 2008Daga R.R. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, Vogel et al., 2007Vogel S.K. Raabe I. Dereli A. Maghelli N. Tolic-Norrelykke I. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 438-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As such, changes in cell shape leave cells vulnerable to segregation defects leading to polyploidy. The intriguing connection here is that cells might delay mitotic entry until reaching a specific geometry, which then ensures proper segregation of the genome. A similar connection appears to operate in bacterial cells, where the chromosomes occupy such a large proportion of the cell volume that their segregation inevitably follows the long axis of the cell. This chromosome positioning is exploited by the nucleoid occlusion system to reinforce spatial control of cytokinesis by the Min systems (Bernhardt and de Boer, 2005Bernhardt T.G. de Boer P.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, Wu and Errington, 2004Wu L.J. Errington J. Cell. 2004; 117: 915-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2009Wu L.J. Ishikawa S. Kawai Y. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. Errington J. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1940-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, additional work has demonstrated the ability of bacterial “spindles” that segregate plasmid DNA and contain the actin-like protein ParM to follow geometric cues both in vitro and in vivo (Campbell and Mullins, 2007Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Garner et al., 2007Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, in both fission yeast and bacterial cells, the controls over cell division are linked with mechanisms of spindle orientation and behavior through cell geometry. These examples support the possibility of geometry-sensing mechanisms that control the timing of cell division to ensure proper segregation of the genome. But what about cell types that control division according to different signals? For example, budding yeast cells initiate mitosis through a Wee1 signaling pathway that shares many components with fission yeast, but this budding yeast pathway is not known to use a gradient-based signal and does not appear to monitor geometry. Rather, the budding yeast pathway is proposed to survey the integrity of the bud neck and proper organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Keaton and Lew, 2006Keaton M.A. Lew D.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This difference becomes interesting when one considers the different mechanisms that determine spindle orientation and positioning in these two cell types. Unlike geometry-based positioning of the fission yeast spindle, the budding yeast spindle is pulled from the mother cell into the bud neck along polarized actin cables, which emanate from the daughter cell (Siller and Doe, 2009Siller K.H. Doe C.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This means that spindle positioning in budding yeast cells requires proper organization of the bud neck and the actin cytoskeleton—the two factors that appear to control cell division timing through Wee1 and Cdk1. This raises the possibility that, in some cell types, checkpoints regulating mitotic entry could be tailored to the mechanisms that control events during cell division. How might these lessons from yeast and bacterial cells relate to animal cells and other multicellular organisms? In such cells, signals controlling progression through the cell cycle are likely to come from both intrinsic (e.g., cell geometry) and extrinsic (e.g., contact inhibition) sources. This contrasts with single-celled organisms such as bacteria and yeast, which act more often through intrinsic, or cell-autonomous, signals with some modulation by environmental cues such as nutritional availability. Cell geometry appears to play at least some role in controlling the cell cycle in animal cells, in part through signaling pathways that respond to cortical tension generated by both cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (Chen et al., 1997Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar). The complexity of distinguishing between intrinsic versus extrinsic cues may have contributed to the long-standing debates over the existence of size control in animal cells. Recent work supports the existence of such size control with implications for signals controlling cell division (Tzur et al., 2009Tzur A. Kafri R. LeBleu V.S. Lahav G. Kirschner M.W. Science. 2009; 325: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), although it remains to be seen how widespread this effect may be for different cell types and organisms. Despite these complications, several lines of evidence suggest that controls over the cell cycle and DNA segregation may be linked in at least some animal cell types. One means of focusing on intrinsic signals in animal cells is to examine the first division in a newly fertilized embryo. Such work in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans has identified polarity proteins that control both mitotic entry and spindle orientation (Rivers et al., 2008Rivers D.M. Moreno S. Abraham M. Ahringer J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In many cell types, including C. elegans embryos, the mitotic spindle is oriented and positioned by interactions between astral microtubules and the cell cortex. In C. elegans, PAR proteins in the cell cortex position the spindle and also control two central regulators of mitotic entry—Cdc25 and Polo kinase. Thus, in animal cells, the control system that decides when to enter mitosis and the control system that orients the mitotic spindle can be linked. As in single-celled organisms, this connection relies on cortical cell polarity proteins, and such polarized pulling forces at the cell cortex can align the mitotic spindle to direct asymmetric divisions. These asymmetric cell divisions can drive cell fate decisions, implicating these connections in cell differentiation and stem cell renewal (Siller and Doe, 2009Siller K.H. Doe C.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The common link between the mitotic entry control system and spindle orientation appears to be cortical polarity factors, which also facilitate mitotic entry in human cells. Indeed, a growing number of focal adhesion proteins, which contribute to the orientation of cell division by organizing actin stress fibers (Thery et al., 2005Thery M. Racine V. Pepin A. Piel M. Chen Y. Sibarita J.B. Bornens M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), have been linked to mitotic entry through the Aurora-A kinase (Hirota et al., 2000Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y.

Cell. 2005; 20: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These examples suggest a conserved ability of cortical polarity factors to link cell geometry with mitotic entry and spindle orientation. This may allow the cell to delay entry into mitosis until proper assembly of these polarized cues for spindle orientation and chromosome segregation. We have described a range of mechanisms that monitor cell geometry and link these measurements to mitosis and cell division in different cell types and organisms. This type of cell size control checkpoint differs from others that have been proposed to monitor some surrogate of cell size, such as biosynthetic capacity or protein mass (Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004Jorgensen P. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R1014-R1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These types of size control operate at the beginning of the cell cycle, and so this difference may reflect differing requirements for starting a cell cycle versus triggering the end of the cell cycle at cell division. To start a cell cycle, size checkpoints may need to ensure that sufficient resources are available to power through the long haul of a full cell cycle, which includes a range of energy-consuming tasks and cellular growth. At division, different checkpoints may need also to ensure that both the cellular geometry and cortical protein machinery needed for successful mitosis and cytokinesis have been assembled. It is important to note that such geometry sensing is likely to be part of a larger size control system that may include a range of additional input signals. Identification of the input signals that trigger mitotic entry in different cell types or act redundantly within the same cell type may help to illuminate how broadly geometry-sensing mechanisms are used. In multicellular organisms, these intrinsic signals are likely to be additionally coordinated with a range of extrinsic cues related to the extracellular environment."

We also found that VDUP1 knockdown delayed the onset of Ras-induced cellular senescence. Subsequently, we found that FOXO3A, whose activity increased in senescent cells, transcriptionally up-regulates VDUP1 expression and miR-17-5p, whose expression decreased in senescent cells, directly interacted with the 3′-untranslated region of VDUP1 transcripts, and destabilized VDUP1 mRNA in young cells.

https://openalex.org/W2018301957,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) plays an important role in the development of retinal vasculature. LRP5 loss-of-function mutations cause incomplete development of retinal vessel network in humans as well as in mice. To understand the underlying mechanism for how LRP5 mutations lead to retinal vascular abnormalities, we have determined the retinal cell types that express LRP5 and investigated specific molecular and cellular functions that may be regulated by LRP5 signaling in the retina.We characterized the development of retinal vasculature in LRP5 mutant mice using specific retinal cell makers and a GFP transgene expressed in retinal endothelial cells. Our data revealed that retinal vascular endothelial cells predominantly formed cell clusters in the inner-plexiform layer of LRP5 mutant retina rather than sprouting out or migrating into deeper layers to form normal vascular network in the retina. The IRES-beta-galactosidase (LacZ) report gene under the control of the endogenous LRP5 promoter was highly expressed in Müller cells and was also weakly detected in endothelial cells of the retinal surface vasculature. Moreover, the LRP5 mutant mice had a reduction of a Müller cell-specific glutamine transporter, Slc38a5, and showed a decrease in b-wave amplitude of electroretinogram.LRP5 is not only essential for vascular endothelial cells to sprout, migrate and/or anastomose in the deeper plexus during retinal vasculature development but is also important for the functions of Müller cells and retinal interneurons. Müller cells may utilize LRP5-mediated signaling pathway to regulate vascular development in deeper layers and to maintain the function of retinal interneurons."

https://openalex.org/W2002500466,"Background Soluble leptin receptor (OBRe), one of several leptin receptor isoforms, is the only bona fide leptin binding protein in plasma. Our earlier studies demonstrated that OBRe modulates leptin levels in circulation. Both clinical and in vitro studies have shown that OBRe expression is inversely correlated to body weight and leptin levels. However, it is not clear whether OBRe plays an active role, either in collaboration with leptin or independently, in the maintenance of body weight. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the function of OBRe in the regulation of energy homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice that express OBRe under the control of human serum amyloid P (hSAP) component gene promoter. The transgene led to approximately doubling of OBRe in circulation in the transgenic mice than in wild type control mice. Transgenic mice exhibited lower body weight at 4 weeks of age, and slower rate of weight gain when compared with control mice. Furthermore, transgenic mice had lower body fat content. Indirect calorimetry revealed that transgenic mice had reduced food intake, increased basal metabolic rate, and increased lipid oxidation, which could account for the differences in body weight and body fat content. Transgenic mice also showed higher total circulating leptin, with the majority of it being in the bound form, while the amount of free leptin is comparable between transgenic and control mice. Conclusions These results are consistent with the role of OBRe as a leptin binding protein in regulating leptin's bioavailability and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2053319520,"Steinernema carpocapsae is an insect parasitic nematode used in biological control, which infects insects penetrating by mouth and anus and invading the hemocoelium through the midgut wall. Invasion has been described as a key factor in nematode virulence and suggested to be mediated by proteases. A serine protease cDNA from the parasitic stage was sequenced (sc-sp-1); the recombinant protein was produced in an Escherichia coli system, and a native protein was purified from the secreted products. Both proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry to be encoded by the sc-sp-1 gene. Sc-SP-1 has a pI of 8.7, a molecular mass of 27.3 kDa, a catalytic efficiency of 22.2 × 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) against N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, and is inhibited by chymostatin (IC 0.07) and PMSF (IC 0.73). Sc-SP-1 belongs to the chymotrypsin family, based on sequence and biochemical analysis. Only the nematode parasitic stage expressed sc-sp-1. These nematodes in the midgut lumen, prepared to invade the insect hemocoelium, expressed higher levels than those already in the hemocoelium. Moreover, parasitic nematode sense insect peritrophic membrane and hemolymph more quickly than they do other tissues, which initiates sc-sp-1 expression. Ex vivo, Sc-SP-1 was able to bind to insect midgut epithelium and to cause cell detachment from basal lamina. In vitro, Sc-SP-1 formed holes in an artificial membrane model (Matrigel), whereas Sc-SP-1 treated with PMSF did not, very likely because it hydrolyzes matrix glycoproteins. These findings highlight the S. carpocapsae-invasive process that is a key step in the parasitism thus opening new perspectives for improving nematode virulence to use in biological control."
https://openalex.org/W2026995513,"Ion channels of the degenerin/epithelial Na(+) channel gene family are Na(+) channels that are blocked by the diuretic amiloride and are implicated in several human diseases. The brain liver intestine Na(+) channel (BLINaC) is an ion channel of the degenerin/epithelial Na(+) channel gene family with unknown function. In rodents, it is expressed mainly in brain, liver, and intestine, and to a lesser extent in kidney and lung. Expression of rat BLINaC (rBLINaC) in Xenopus oocytes leads to small unselective currents that are only weakly sensitive to amiloride. Here, we show that rBLINaC is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+). Removal of Ca(2+) leads to robust currents and increases Na(+) selectivity of the ion pore. Strikingly, the species ortholog from mouse (mBLINaC) has an almost 250-fold lower Ca(2+) affinity than rBLINaC, rendering mBLINaC constitutively active at physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+). In addition, mBLINaC is more selective for Na(+) and has a 700-fold higher amiloride affinity than rBLINaC. We show that a single amino acid in the extracellular domain determines these profound species differences. Collectively, our results suggest that rBLINaC is opened by an unknown ligand whereas mBLINaC is a constitutively open epithelial Na(+) channel."

https://openalex.org/W2090071443,"β-Arrestins are crucial regulators of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, desensitization, and internalization. Despite the long-standing paradigm that agonist-promoted receptor phosphorylation is required for β-arrestin2 recruitment, emerging evidence suggests that phosphorylation-independent mechanisms play a role in β-arrestin2 recruitment by GPCRs. Several PDZ proteins are known to interact with GPCRs and serve as cytosolic adaptors to modulate receptor signaling and trafficking. Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory factors (NHERFs) exert a major role in GPCR signaling. By combining imaging and biochemical and biophysical methods we investigated the interplay among NHERF1, β-arrestin2, and the parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 (PTHR). We show that NHERF1 and β-arrestin2 can independently bind to the PTHR and form a ternary complex in cultured human embryonic kidney cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Although NHERF1 interacts constitutively with the PTHR, β-arrestin2 binding is promoted by receptor activation. NHERF1 interacts directly with β-arrestin2 without using the PTHR as an interface. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies revealed that the kinetics of PTHR and β-arrestin2 interactions were modulated by NHERF1. These findings suggest a model in which NHERF1 may serve as an adaptor, bringing β-arrestin2 into close proximity to the PTHR, thereby facilitating β-arrestin2 recruitment after receptor activation."

IntroductionThe genus Mycobacterium contains a number of medically significant species, most notably the devastating human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis that causes around 2 million deaths each year, the most by any single infectious agent. Despite the availability of a vaccine, the number of infected individuals worldwide continues to increase, as does the prevalence of drug-resistant forms of M. tuberculosis (1World Health Organization WHO Report 2009: Global Tuberculosis Control, Epidemiology, Strategy, Financing. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2009: 1-314Google Scholar). A key virulence factor is the unique mycobacterial cell wall that consists of a core structure as follows: peptidoglycan covalently linked to arabinogalactan esterified with mycolic acids to form the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan or “mAGP” complex and a series of free glycolipids, including trehalose monomycolates, trehalose dimycolates, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, and lipoarabinomannans (2Brennan P.J. Tuberculosis. 2003; 83: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), that facilitate vital interactions with host cells to initiate and maintain an infection. The essentiality of the core for mycobacterial growth and survival leads to the biosynthetic enzymes involved and being considered as ideal targets for drug development (3Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2007; 7: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).A subset of genes required for the late steps of mycolic acid and arabinogalactan biosynthesis are located in proximity to the genomes of mycobacteria and corynebacteria. These genes include a well characterized cell wall biosynthesis cluster encoding enzymes required for the activation (AccD4 and FadD32) and condensation (Pks13) (4Portevin D. De Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) of mycolic acid intermediates prior to the final reduction step (5Lea-Smith D.J. Pyke J.S. Tull D. McConville M.J. Coppel R.L.

Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar).Despite extensive functional characterization of this cluster over the last decade, the in vivo function of the product of one gene, Rv3802c, remains unknown, although mycolyltransferase (11Takayama K. Wang C. Besra G.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) or Pks13-associated thioesterase (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) functions have been suggested. Although its genomic location strongly suggests a role in cell wall biosynthesis, definitive proof of such a role is lacking. The putative product of Rv3802c has a predicted signal sequence that contains a possible transmembrane domain, and it has been expressed to assess immunological responses (13West N.P. Wozniak T.M. Valenzuela J. Feng C.G. Sher A. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. Vaccine. 2008; 26: 3853-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and enzymatic activities. The enzyme is one of seven cutinase-like proteins in M. tuberculosis and is retained in the cell wall, following translocation across the cell membrane (14West N.P. Chow F.M. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown it to have phospholipase A and thioesterase activities (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), consistent with a role in mycolic acid biosynthesis, and significant lipase activity completely dependent on its Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad (14West N.P. Chow F.M. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A very recent study has suggested a role for Rv3802c in regulation of outer lipid composition in response to stress because the induction of the Corynebacterium glutamicum ortholog triggered an increase in mycolic acid biosynthesis as part of an outer membrane remodeling response to heat stress (15Meniche X. Labarre C. de Sousa-d'Auria C. Huc E. Laval F. Tropis M. Bayan N. Portevin D. Guilhot C. Daffe M. Houssin C. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 7323-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Recently, Rv3802c was identified as a major target of tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) 6The abbreviations used are: THLtetrahydrolipstatinKnkanamycinSmstreptomycinPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationBistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneTEMtransmission electron microscopy. (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). THL is a well characterized and irreversible inhibitor of serine esterases (16Hadváry P. Lengsfeld H. Wolfer H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), originally identified for its specificity for pancreatic lipases, and thus was developed as an anti-obesity drug. THL has been reported to bind covalently to the catalytic serine residue of pancreatic lipase (17Hadváry P. Sidler W. Meister W. Vetter W. Wolfer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to have similar affinity for human fatty-acid synthase (18Pemble 4th, C.W. Johnson L.C. Kridel S.J. Lowther W.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to its actions in humans, THL inhibits and disrupts cell wall formation in several mycobacterial species, with the exception of the nonpathogenic model species Mycobacterium smegmatis (19Kremer L. de Chastellier C. Dobson G. Gibson K.J. Bifani P. Balor S. Gorvel J.P. Locht C. Minnikin D.E. Besra G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1113-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rv3802c was strongly inhibited by THL, whereas the nonorthologous but cutinase motif-bearing M. smegmatis lipase MSMEG_1403 was not inhibited at up to a 500:1 inhibitor to enzyme molar ratio (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).To better understand the enzymology of Rv3802c, we expressed and purified the M. tuberculosis enzyme, its homolog in the nonpathogenic model species M. smegmatis, and the ortholog from a related species, C. glutamicum, and we assessed their inhibition by THL. We report here that the closest M. smegmatis homolog to Rv3802c, MSMEG_6394, is inhibited by THL. The crystal structure of MSMEG_6394, along with direct evidence of the essentiality of MSMEG_6394 in M. smegmatis, indicates a fundamental role of this lipase in Mycobacteria.DISCUSSIONThe unique and highly impermeable mycobacterial cell wall is a key virulence factor that forms the interface between host and pathogen. It enables the bacterium to resist destruction by the host and also contains unusual molecules that promote uptake by host macrophages and modify host responses to create a favorable environment for bacterial survival and replication. As a result, the biosynthetic processes involved in the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall have been the subject of intensive research, and many of the key cell wall enzymes are now known. For example, nearly all genes within an ∼20-kb genetic locus dedicated to cell wall biosynthesis have now been characterized. In this study, we have focused on one incompletely characterized gene of this cluster, Rv3802c from M. tuberculosis.Homology searches using M. tuberculosis Rv3802c revealed that this gene is very well conserved in Actinomycetes genomes, and we chose to focus on previously uncharacterized homologs from M. smegmatis and C. glutamicum. Previous studies using p-nitrophenyl butyrate substrates had revealed a significant lipase activity of Rv3802c (14West N.P. Chow F.M. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and THL-inhibited phospholipase A/thioesterase activities have also been reported (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that all three enzymes have significant lipase activities with similar affinity for the substrate and turnover rate. In addition, all three enzymes are inhibited by micromolar concentrations of THL. This suggests that the active sites of all three enzymes are relatively similar. Although Parker et al. (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported a lack of THL inhibition against an M. smegmatis enzyme, the enzyme tested (MSMEG_1403) is not the homolog of Rv3802c but rather a culture supernatant enzyme with phospholipase A activity. They suggested that a lack of MSMEG_1403 inhibition by THL is significant given that M. smegmatis growth is also not inhibited by the drug. However, our finding that MSMEG_6394 is inhibited by THL as well as being an essential enzyme in M. smegmatis would suggest that growth should be inhibited. We propose that the lack of growth inhibition in this organism is due to the inability of THL to reach its target(s) rather than a lack of activity against any particular enzyme. Because THL is active against M. tuberculosis, which shares a very similar cell wall architecture with M. smegmatis (42Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), lack of cell entry seems an unlikely possibility. We suggest that efflux of the drug via one of the many transporters in M. smegmatis is the most likely explanation for the lack of activity against this organism.The annotation of Rv3802c as a putative cutinase and the observed enzyme activities of Rv3802c and its orthologs are entirely consistent with the three-dimensional structure that showed MSMEG_6394 to be a member of the cutinase family of α/β hydrolases. Interestingly, one of the closest structural matches was to mycobacteriophage lysin B (37Payne K. Sun Q. Sacchettini J. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a novel mycolylarabinogalactan esterase that cleaves the mycobacterial cell wall, releasing free mycolic acids from the arabinogalactan layer. LysB has been proposed to facilitate mycobacterial lysis by cleaving the outer mycolate-containing layer of the cell wall from the peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan complex (37Payne K. Sun Q. Sacchettini J. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), promoting bacteriophage release from its host. The structural similarity raises the possibility of a similar function for Rv3802c, and points to a degradative role for this enzyme during mycobacterial growth. Because the deposition of new cell wall material requires cleavage and opening of the existing structure, a lipase-like Rv3802c could theoretically fulfill this role. Indeed, the unusual cell wall of members of the Actinomycetes would require the presence of a dedicated enzyme restricted to this group of bacteria. This role is consistent with the retention of Rv3802c in the cell wall, although other cutinase-like proteins are secreted into the culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis (14West N.P. Chow F.M. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This function would also explain the proposed essentiality of Rv3802c and the elongated nature of our conditional knock-out in M. smegmatis grown at the nonpermissive temperature, as described below.Rv3802c is thought to be essential for life in M. tuberculosis because of the failure of the Rv3802c gene to accumulate transposon insertions in saturation mutagenesis experiments (10Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar), although direct evidence of essentiality is lacking. Our inability to disrupt the homologous gene in M. smegmatis (MSMEG_6394) suggested essentiality in this species as well, and we confirmed this by creating and analyzing CKO6394, a conditional knock-out strain. CKO6394 was found to be reliant on the plasmid-encoded copy of MSMEG_6394, and curing the plasmid correlated with the appearance of surface roughness, loss of cell wall integrity, and appearance of large electron transparent zones in the cytoplasm of otherwise intact cells. Our interpretation of these observations is that the loss of the MSMEG_6394 gene results in cell death via the formation of the electron transparent zones followed by progression to the lysis stage over time. Given the suggested role of Rv3802c in mycolic acid biosynthesis (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we tried to detect lipid bodies with a fluorescent lipid stain, but the results were inconclusive. The composition of these zones is not known, but they seem to be composed of a hard substance that resists the resin added during processing for EM. Interestingly, Kremer et al. (19Kremer L. de Chastellier C. Dobson G. Gibson K.J. Bifani P. Balor S. Gorvel J.P. Locht C. Minnikin D.E. Besra G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1113-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported minor surface changes and the presence of electron-translucent bodies in THL-treated Mycobacterium kansasii, although these were confirmed to be lipid bodies and were not as well defined as the electron transparent zones described here. We also attempted to extract cell wall components following loss of the plasmid to try and detect an accumulating species, but cell death resulted in a spectrum of cell wall changes, most associated with cellular disintegration and not directly related to the loss of Rv3802c.A recent study has suggested a role for Rv3802c and its orthologs in regulating outer membrane lipid composition under stress conditions (15Meniche X. Labarre C. de Sousa-d'Auria C. Huc E. Laval F. Tropis M. Bayan N. Portevin D. Guilhot C. Daffe M. Houssin C. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 7323-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The authors found that the C. glutamicum ortholog NCgl2775 could be disrupted to give a viable mutant with no obvious alteration in cell wall composition, and we have confirmed these findings as our own mutant of C. glutamicum NCgl2775 was viable (data not shown). This study provided evidence of transcriptional induction of NCgl2775 during heat stress leading to an increase in mycolic acid biosynthesis and a decrease in phospholipid content (15Meniche X.

However, this finding does not account for the essential nature of MSMEG_6394 and Rv3802c in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, respectively, under normal growth conditions. This discrepancy strongly suggests that a more fundamental role for Rv3802c and its orthologs remains unidentified. We propose a degradative role for the enzyme that is essential for the deposition of new cell wall material during active mycobacterial growth. The essentiality of Rv3802c and the fact its inhibitor, THL, also kills M. tuberculosis (19Kremer L. de Chastellier C. Dobson G. Gibson K.J. Bifani P. Balor S. Gorvel J.P. Locht C. Minnikin D.E.

World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2009: 1-314Google Scholar). IntroductionThe genus Mycobacterium contains a number of medically significant species, most notably the devastating human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis that causes around 2 million deaths each year, the most by any single infectious agent. Despite the availability of a vaccine, the number of infected individuals worldwide continues to increase, as does the prevalence of drug-resistant forms of M. tuberculosis (1World Health Organization WHO Report 2009: Global Tuberculosis Control, Epidemiology, Strategy, Financing. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2009: 1-314Google Scholar). A key virulence factor is the unique mycobacterial cell wall that consists of a core structure as follows: peptidoglycan covalently linked to arabinogalactan esterified with mycolic acids to form the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan or “mAGP” complex and a series of free glycolipids, including trehalose monomycolates, trehalose dimycolates, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, and lipoarabinomannans (2Brennan P.J. Tuberculosis. 2003; 83: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), that facilitate vital interactions with host cells to initiate and maintain an infection. The essentiality of the core for mycobacterial growth and survival leads to the biosynthetic enzymes involved and being considered as ideal targets for drug development (3Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2007; 7: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).A subset of genes required for the late steps of mycolic acid and arabinogalactan biosynthesis are located in proximity to the genomes of mycobacteria and corynebacteria. These genes include a well characterized cell wall biosynthesis cluster encoding enzymes required for the activation (AccD4 and FadD32) and condensation (Pks13) (4Portevin D. De Sousa-D'Auria C.

Also within the cluster are genes required for arabinogalactan biosynthesis (atfB, glf, glfT, and Rv3806c) (7Seidel M. Alderwick L.J. Birch H.L. Sahm H. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Biol.

Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar).Despite extensive functional characterization of this cluster over the last decade, the in vivo function of the product of one gene, Rv3802c, remains unknown, although mycolyltransferase (11Takayama K. Wang C. Besra G.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) or Pks13-associated thioesterase (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) functions have been suggested. Although its genomic location strongly suggests a role in cell wall biosynthesis, definitive proof of such a role is lacking. The putative product of Rv3802c has a predicted signal sequence that contains a possible transmembrane domain, and it has been expressed to assess immunological responses (13West N.P. Wozniak T.M. Valenzuela J. Feng C.G. Sher A. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. Vaccine. 2008; 26: 3853-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and enzymatic activities. The enzyme is one of seven cutinase-like proteins in M. tuberculosis and is retained in the cell wall, following translocation across the cell membrane (14West N.P. Chow F.M. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown it to have phospholipase A and thioesterase activities (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), consistent with a role in mycolic acid biosynthesis, and significant lipase activity completely dependent on its Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad (14West N.P. Chow F.M. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A very recent study has suggested a role for Rv3802c in regulation of outer lipid composition in response to stress because the induction of the Corynebacterium glutamicum ortholog triggered an increase in mycolic acid biosynthesis as part of an outer membrane remodeling response to heat stress (15Meniche X. Labarre C. de Sousa-d'Auria C. Huc E. Laval F. Tropis M. Bayan N. Portevin D. Guilhot C. Daffe M. Houssin C. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 7323-7332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Recently, Rv3802c was identified as a major target of tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) 6The abbreviations used are: THLtetrahydrolipstatinKnkanamycinSmstreptomycinPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationBistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneTEMtransmission electron microscopy. (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). THL is a well characterized and irreversible inhibitor of serine esterases (16Hadváry P. Lengsfeld H. Wolfer H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), originally identified for its specificity for pancreatic lipases, and thus was developed as an anti-obesity drug. THL has been reported to bind covalently to the catalytic serine residue of pancreatic lipase (17Hadváry P. Sidler W. Meister W. Vetter W. Wolfer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2021-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to have similar affinity for human fatty-acid synthase (18Pemble 4th, C.W. Johnson L.C. Kridel S.J. Lowther W.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to its actions in humans, THL inhibits and disrupts cell wall formation in several mycobacterial species, with the exception of the nonpathogenic model species Mycobacterium smegmatis (19Kremer L. de Chastellier C. Dobson G. Gibson K.J. Bifani P. Balor S. Gorvel J.P. Locht C. Minnikin D.E. Besra G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1113-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rv3802c was strongly inhibited by THL, whereas the nonorthologous but cutinase motif-bearing M. smegmatis lipase MSMEG_1403 was not inhibited at up to a 500:1 inhibitor to enzyme molar ratio (12Parker S.K. Barkley R.M. Rino J.G. Vasil M.L. PLoS One. 2009; 4e4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).To better understand the enzymology of Rv3802c, we expressed and purified the M. tuberculosis enzyme, its homolog in the nonpathogenic model species M. smegmatis, and the ortholog from a related species, C. glutamicum, and we assessed their inhibition by THL. We report here that the closest M. smegmatis homolog to Rv3802c, MSMEG_6394, is inhibited by THL. The crystal structure of MSMEG_6394, along with direct evidence of the essentiality of MSMEG_6394 in M. smegmatis, indicates a fundamental role of this lipase in Mycobacteria."

We present results of a tuberculosis contact investigation with a new early-secretory-antigenic-target (ESAT)-6 and culture-filtrate-protein (CFP)-10 specific interleukin (IL)-2 ELISpot in addition to ESAT-6 and CFP-10 specific IFN-γ ELISpot and tuberculin skin testing (TST). Results of the TST, IFN-γ ELISpot and IL-2 ELISpot were positive in 6/172 (3.4%), 7/167 (4.2%) and 6/196 (3.1%) of contacts, respectively. Close contact (≥100 hours) to the index case increased the risk of positive results in the IFN-γ ELISpot, TST, and IL-2 ELISpot by 40.8, 19.3, and 2.5 times, respectively. Individuals with a positive IFN-γ ELISpot/negative IL-2 ELISpot result had a median (IQR) duration of index case exposure of 568 hours (133_1000) compared to individuals with a positive IFN-γ ELISpot/positive IL-2 ELISpot result (median = 24 hours; 20_130; p-value = 0.047). Combination of a M. tuberculosis specific IFN-γ ELISpot with a M. tuberculosis specific IL-2 ELISpot significantly improved the identification of individuals with the highest risk of recent M. tuberculosis infection and is a promising method that should be explored to target tuberculosis preventive chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2047862752,"HIV vaccine development has been hampered by issues such as undefined correlates of protection and extensive diversity of HIV. We addressed these issues using a previously established SIV-macaque model in which SIV mutants with deletions of multiple gp120 N-glycans function as potent live attenuated vaccines to induce near-sterile immunity against the parental pathogenic SIVmac239. In this study, we investigated the protective efficacy of these mutants against a highly pathogenic heterologous SIVsmE543-3 delivered intravenously to rhesus macaques with diverse MHC genotypes. All 11 vaccinated macaques contained the acute-phase infection with blood viral loads below the level of detection between 4 and 10 weeks postchallenge (pc), following a transient but marginal peak of viral replication at 2 weeks in only half of the challenged animals. In the chronic phase, seven vaccinees contained viral replication for over 80 weeks pc, while four did not. Neutralizing antibodies against challenge virus were not detected. Although overall levels of SIV specific T cell responses did not correlate with containment of acute and chronic viral replication, a critical role of cellular responses in the containment of viral replication was suggested. Emergence of viruses with altered fitness due to recombination between the vaccine and challenge viruses and increased gp120 glycosylation was linked to the failure to control SIV. These results demonstrate the induction of effective protective immune responses in a significant number of animals against heterologous virus by infection with deglycosylated attenuated SIV mutants in macaques with highly diverse MHC background. These findings suggest that broad HIV cross clade protection is possible, even in hosts with diverse genetic backgrounds. In summary, results of this study indicate that deglycosylated live-attenuated vaccines may provide a platform for the elucidation of correlates of protection needed for a successful HIV vaccine against diverse isolates."

https://openalex.org/W1977435255,"Biosynthesis of the dolichol linked oligosaccharide (DLO) required for protein N-glycosylation starts on the cytoplasmic face of the ER to give Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol, which then flips into the ER for further glycosylation yielding mature DLO (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol). After transfer of Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) onto protein, dolichol-PP is recycled to dolichol-P and reused for DLO biosynthesis. Because de novo dolichol synthesis is slow, dolichol recycling is rate limiting for protein glycosylation. Immature DLO intermediates may also be recycled by pyrophosphatase-mediated cleavage to yield dolichol-P and phosphorylated oligosaccharides (fOSGN2-P). Here, we examine fOSGN2-P generation in cells from patients with type I Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG I) in which defects in the dolichol cycle cause accumulation of immature DLO intermediates and protein hypoglycosylation.In EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from CDG I patients and normal subjects a correlation exists between the quantities of metabolically radiolabeled fOSGN2-P and truncated DLO intermediates only when these two classes of compounds possess 7 or less hexose residues. Larger fOSGN2-P were difficult to detect despite an abundance of more fully mannosylated and glucosylated DLO. When CDG Ig cells, which accumulate Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol, are permeabilised so that vesicular transport and protein synthesis are abolished, the DLO pool required for Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-P generation could be depleted by adding exogenous glycosylation acceptor peptide. Under conditions where a glycotripeptide and neutral free oligosaccharides remain predominantly in the lumen of the ER, Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-P appears in the cytosol without detectable generation of ER luminal Man(7)GlcNAc(2)-P.The DLO pools required for N-glycosylation and fOSGN2-P generation are functionally linked and this substantiates the hypothesis that pyrophosphatase-mediated cleavage of DLO intermediates yields recyclable dolichol-P. The kinetics of cytosolic fOSGN2-P generation from a luminally-generated DLO intermediate demonstrate the presence of a previously undetected ER-to-cytosol translocation process for either fOSGN2-P or DLO."
https://openalex.org/W1987432334,"Dissemination of Bacillus anthracis from the respiratory mucosa is a critical step in the establishment of inhalational anthrax. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that this organism was able to penetrate the lung epithelium by directly entering into epithelial cells of the lung; however the molecular details of B. anthracis breaching the epithelium were lacking. Here, using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors, dominant negative mutants, and colocalization experiments, we demonstrated that internalization of spores by epithelial cells was actin-dependent and was mediated by the Rho-family GTPase Cdc42 but not RhoA or Rac1. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity was also required as indicated by the inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, and a PI3K dominant negative (DN) mutant Δp85α. In addition, spore entry into epithelial cells (but not into macrophages) required the activity of Src as indicated by the inhibitory effect of Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitors, PP2 and SU6656, and specific siRNA knockdown of Src. Enrichment of PI3K and F-actin around spore attachment sites was observed and was significantly reduced by treatment with SFK and PI3K inhibitors, respectively. Moreover, B. anthracis translocation through cultured lung epithelial cells was significantly impaired by SFK inhibitors, suggesting that this signaling pathway is important for bacterial dissemination. The effect of the inhibitor on dissemination in vivo was then evaluated. SU6656 treatment of mice significantly reduced B. anthracis dissemination from the lung to distal organs and prolonged the median survival time of mice compared to the untreated control group. Together these results described a signaling pathway specifically required for spore entry into epithelial cells and provided evidence suggesting that this pathway is important for dissemination and virulence in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1986538886,"Activation-induced deaminase (AID) initiates somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and class switch recombination by deaminating variable and switch region DNA cytidines to uridines. AID is predominantly cytoplasmic and must enter the nuclear compartment to initiate these distinct antibody gene diversification reactions. Nuclear AID is relatively short-lived, as it is efficiently exported by a CRM1-dependent mechanism and it is susceptible to proteasome-dependent degradation. To help shed light on mechanisms of post-translational regulation, a yeast-based screen was performed to identify AID-interacting proteins. The calcium and integrin binding protein CIB1 was identified by sequencing and the interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments. The AID/CIB1 resisted DNase and RNase treatment, and it is therefore unlikely to be mediated by nucleic acid. The requirement for CIB1 in AID-mediated antibody gene diversification reactions was assessed in CIB1-deficient DT40 cells and in knockout mice, but immunoglobulin gene conversion and class switch recombination appeared normal. The DT40 system was also used to show that CIB1 over-expression has no effect on gene conversion and that AID-EGFP subcellular localization is normal. These combined data demonstrate that CIB1 is not required for AID to mediate antibody gene diversification processes. It remains possible that CIB1 has an alternative, a redundant or a subtle non-limiting regulatory role in AID biology."

Quinn Eastman provides a progress report. The 2009 stimulus package released a burst of pent-up creativity in the applications submitted by US researchers, but there was a complicating factor with funding decisions: the need for quick results. Quinn Eastman provides a progress report. For government construction projects, “shovel readiness” means managers are ready to hire shovel-wielding workers as soon as the money becomes available. But when the US Congress passed the stimulus package—more formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)—in February last year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) needed to figure out how to translate this concept into research projects carried out by pipette-wielding scientists. A year ago, NIH officials were confronted with the task of distributing a huge stimulus bounty of $8.2 billion for research projects and $1.8 million for construction and equipment. These funds were in addition to the regular $30.3 billion allocated to the NIH in 2009. “We were overjoyed at being able to participate,” says Sally Rockey, NIH's acting deputy director for extramural research. “We knew that research universities play a powerful role in driving the economic engine in many communities.” Although not explicitly targeting job creation, the NIH resolved to choose from among the flood of applications (30,000 in the 2009 fiscal year) high-quality research projects with the ability to produce results quickly, while factoring in geographic balance. Looming over these decisions was the requirement that stimulus money be spent in 2 years, and the expectation that Congress would not be as generous with the NIH in future years. One year later, with most of the money committed, a complex picture is emerging of how these factors are playing out. The NIH institutes allocated a grand total of $4.8 billion in ARRA funds in 2009 but did so in different ways (http://report.nih.gov/UploadDocs/Final_NIH_ARRA_FY2009_Funding.pdf; Table 1). For example, some institutes favored payline extensions. These fit into the existing peer review framework for traditional NIH grants, enabling the funding of projects that narrowly missed being supported in 2008 and 2009. Meanwhile, other institutes favored administrative supplements, which offered speed (principal investigators applied directly to NIH program officers) and the ability to keep postdocs or technicians on the job or upgrade old equipment. In addition, ARRA-specific programs such as the Challenge and Grand Opportunity grants were designed to drive one-time investment into specific research areas such as biomarkers, genomics, and regenerative medicine and could reward fresh ideas, with applications not requiring as much preliminary data. Another ARRA-specific program, p30 core center grants, bolstered recruitment packages for new faculty hires.Table 1NIH ARRA-Funded Allocations in 2009aEstimated job creation/retention: 50,000 people.NIH ARRA Funding for FY2009Amount# of AwardsAverage SizeGrants$4.35 billion (12,786 projects)R&D contracts$390 millionIntramural support + administration$80 millionTotal$4.82 billionBreakdown of GrantsNew ARRA-specific programs$1.15 billion1436$801,000Payline extension$1.43 billion3894$367,000Competing supplements$220 million419$520,000Administrative supplements$1.51 billion5687$265,000Summer supplements$45 million1350$33,000Breakdown of New ARRA-Specific ProgramsbSome ARRA-specific programs, such as translational grants to small businesses, did not begin until fiscal year 2010.Minority health and health disparities$6.4 million17Heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorders$35.3 million60Challenge grants$389 million840Grand opportunities$625 million376P30 core center grants$80.5 million141Networking resources$13.5 million2Source: http://report.nih.gov/UploadDocs/Final_NIH_ARRA_FY2009_Funding.pdfa Estimated job creation/retention: 50,000 people.b Some ARRA-specific programs, such as translational grants to small businesses, did not begin until fiscal year 2010. Open table in a new tab Source: http://report.nih.gov/UploadDocs/Final_NIH_ARRA_FY2009_Funding.pdf The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) devoted the largest portion of its $505 million stimulus allocation over 2 years to administrative supplements. “We ended up funding more administrative supplements than we expected initially,” says director Jeremy Berg. “We felt this made sense because we tend to cut individual projects' budgets more aggressively than other institutes, and because it seemed to fit the Recovery Act's aims of getting money to people who can hit the ground running.” Meanwhile, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) spent a sizable fraction of its stimulus money ($318 million out of a $1.26 billion 2 year ARRA allocation) on competitive contracts, such as high-throughput sequencing for the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Other institutes, such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), directed the largest portion of their ARRA money ($1.12 billion and $400 million, respectively) toward increasing the number of individual research grants funded. “We had so much good science that was already reviewed and scored,” says NIAID director Tony Fauci. “It made sense to distribute our ARRA money to as many investigators as possible.” NINDS director Story Landis concurs. “Because paylines have been so low, we had an extraordinary number of outstanding grants that were not funded,” she says. “In most cases, these were already scored in peer review and were ready to go.” Research deans and lucky recipients of stimulus money say that the diverse array of opportunities provided flexibility. As chair of the University of California, San Diego's section of neurobiology, Anirvan Ghosh used ARRA funds to recruit two new faculty members for UCSD's Center for Neural Circuits and Behavior. Part of their startup packages came from a p30 core center grant from NINDS and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). “Increasing demand for top-level instrumentation means assembling competitive startup packages in neuroscience is difficult,” Ghosh says. “This funding mechanism greatly facilitated that task, especially when we had a university-wide hiring freeze.” For his own laboratory, Ghosh also won an ARRA-funded Challenge grant to systematically create a large number of “knock-in” mouse lines, each of which can be used to probe the function of a specific class of neurons. A broad illustration of the impact of ARRA funds disbursed through payline extensions comes from the University of Pennsylvania. “We had a problem where established investigators, for the first time, were not getting their grants renewed, and about 40 of them were looking at laying off postdocs or technical staff,” reports Penn's vice provost for research Steve Fluharty. University administrators were willing to provide bridge funding for 2 years, but the ARRA-funded payline extensions restored support to the majority of this group. Through ARRA administrative supplements from NIGMS, Mark Peifer, a cell biologist at the University of North Carolina, kept two senior postdocs in the laboratory for an extra year. He also was able to spruce up a confocal microscope critical for their work on Wnt signaling and cell adhesion. “For us, this has been terrific,” he says. “Over the course of the year, we were able to do some great experiments and are now sending out two manuscripts. And the souped-up microscope is something everyone in our department can use.” But how did NIH officials and scientists together determine whether projects were “shovel-ready”? One obvious interpretation of this prerequisite for stimulus funds is that projects should involve the construction of new buildings or buying new equipment. For example, the NIH's National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) distributed $10.4 million (14 grants) of ARRA funds for electron microscopes or related infrastructure and $24.2 million (46 grants) for confocal microscopes in 2009 and 2010. NIH officials also pledged to fund the research projects that would have the best chance of making scientific progress in the limited 2 year timeframe—difficult under any circumstances. Examining the abstracts of Challenge grants reveals that some investigators took advantage of having samples already collected. Lest that imply lack of imagination, the “in the freezer already” aspect was usually combined with a new technique or technology. For example, at the University of Michigan, Vince Young, a microbiologist using next-generation sequencing techniques, is collaborating with John LiPuma, a clinician with a treasure trove of thousands of patient sputum samples. The project—analyzing the microbes that colonize the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis—is funded by a Challenge grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). “We had been talking about teaming up, but didn't have a lot of preliminary data,” Young says. “This was a great way to jump start the project.” Genome sequencing technology, another common theme for many stimulus projects, is driving advances such as Jim Lupski's research on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, from which he suffers. Lupski, based at the Baylor College of Medicine, recently identified new mutations causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease by sequencing his own entire genome and sections of the genomes of his parents and siblings. He received stimulus money from NINDS to continue his work on genomic rearrangements and neurological disease. “This was a wonderful example of how whole genome analysis could inform the diagnosis and potentially the care of patients with a variety of disorders,” says NINDS director Landis. Beyond physical equipment, several stimulus-funded projects involve creating resources that the entire scientific community can use, long after the money expires. Examples include the American Society of Cell Biology's assembly of microscope slide images into a vast searchable database, and Ghosh's Challenge grant project that is creating many knock-in mouse lines. Regarding clinical trials, which often take several years to complete, not all institutes handled them the same way. Using stimulus money, NCI funded 37 early-phase trials under the ACTNOW (Accelerating Clinical Trials of Novel Oncologic PathWays) program. In contrast, NIAID steered away from using stimulus money for clinical trials, reports director Fauci. “The timeframe wasn't right for most [clinical trial] proposals we looked at,” he says. “We were able to accelerate a few exciting projects related to HIV treatment and prevention, and also pandemic flu. This allowed them to get rolling in 2009 instead of 2010.” The issue of geographic balance when handing out NIH funds has rumbled in Congress for years, says David Goldston, former staff director for the House Committee on Science. “This has been a chronic issue, but less than at other federal research agencies, because research on health can reasonably claim to benefit the entire country,” he says. “So far, the struggle has been over which diseases to focus on, rather than geography.” However, the topic came to the forefront in May when NIH director Francis Collins laid out the 2011 NIH budget request for the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) cited the Jackson Heart Study, a decade-long examination of cardiovascular disease in African Americans, to show that states not usually thought of as research powerhouses can make important contributions. He then asked for further review, so that “some states are not treated too much better than everybody else.” At the hearing, Collins pointed out that construction, funded by the NIH's NCRR, has helped to ensure that stimulus spending was spread more evenly across the US. Twenty-three US states (including Mississippi) are eligible for NCRR Institutional Development Awards (IdEA) based on low success rates when applying for NIH grants. IdEA states received 18% of NCRR's $1.6 billion in stimulus money; overall, IdEA states garnered 9% of ARRA funds, compared with just 7% of the regular NIH budget. Some non-IdEA states, like Florida, markedly increased their share of NIH money thanks to generous stimulus funding. Florida's ARRA haul—39% of its share of the regular 2009 NIH budget—was due to awards to the University of Florida to launch the largest ever clinical study for preventing mobility disability in seniors ($11 million) and to expand “VIVO,” a social network for biomedical researchers ($6 million), in addition to a construction grant for its center for aging research. Younger scientists applying for their first NIH grant now get an advantage relative to their more established colleagues, thanks to policies that NIH's director from 2002 to 2008, Elias Zerhouni, first experimented with and then formalized. These measures are intended to “keep the pipeline flowing” and prevent early stage scientists' applications from being overshadowed by those with more experience, says Sally Rockey at NIH. The gap in success rates between first-time applicants and established investigators for new (non-renewal) R01-equivalent grants was closed for the first time in 2009 (http://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/Charts/SlideGen.aspx?chartId=136&catId=13). However, these data do not include awards made under ARRA, and what success rates would look like after factoring them in is a complicated question, Rockey says. When it came to stimulus money, NIH officials did not make special provisions for newer investigators, and funding mechanisms such as administrative supplements tended to favor established scientists. In addition, several institutes, such as NIGMS, NIAID, and NINDS, advised early stage investigators who hadn't obtained 5 year R01 grants not to apply for 2 year ARRA funds because they would lose the advantage of early stage status and would have to apply again quickly. “We didn't want them to get caught in a bind,” says NIAID director Fauci. He says that ARRA provided indirect benefits to newer scientists. NIAID's 5 year R01 payline for new investigators jumped from 14% in 2008 to 25% in 2009, whereas the payline for experienced investigators stayed at 12%. (The spread for 2010 isn't as much: 16% versus 11%.) Other institutes, such as NCI and NHLBI, funded some newer investigators with ARRA money but committed to supporting them after 2 years with money from the regular budget. This commitment was intended to mitigate the impact of possibly flat budgets in coming years, according to NCI officials. Under federal rules, cost-free extension of 2 year grants to 3 years is seen as relatively routine, but anything beyond that would require special permission. “Even though no special provisions were made for early-stage investigators, they did quite well,” Rockey says, noting that more than 2000 investigators obtained grants for the first time through the stimulus. The stimulus also enabled a surge in the number of New Innovator awards—part of the NIH Roadmap program designed to promote transformative research and limited to early-stage investigators—from 31 recipients in 2008 to 55 in 2009. The stimulus program that has most benefitted postdoctoral researchers making a transition to independence is the p30 core center grant, says Stacy Gelhaus, a cancer pharmacologist and chair of the National Postdoctoral Association's board of directors. She points out that stimulus money did not increase the number of “F” postdoctoral fellowships or “K” mentored career development awards, although some administrative supplements for these types of awards were made available. The p30 program was the response of NIH officials to the tight state budgets and diminished endowments of universities across the country that were delaying or canceling the hiring of new faculty, says NIGMS director Berg. Because of low paylines and success rates, junior faculty have been relying on startup funds for longer periods, he says. Out of several ARRA-specific funding programs, Berg identified the p30 program as one he'd like to see continue. “The benefits we've seen have to be weighed against entry into universities' capacity decisions and increasing future demand for grants,” he says. As part of a new federal initiative (STAR METRICS), economists are beginning to develop metrics to evaluate the impact of the stimulus package on both the scientific landscape and the research workforce. “It looks like it was good to be a new investigator in the last two years,” says Richard Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard who is planning to survey university officials and researchers on how they used stimulus funds. “A few years down the road, incoming people will be competing against the current group, which got a bit of an edge.” Freeman described the stimulus package as a societal experiment for gauging the effects of a pulse of funding on research. As scientists and NIH officials recover from the roller-coaster ride of applying for and receiving ARRA money last year, they may be pondering whether policymakers will take a more results- and metrics-oriented approach to evaluating the success of government-funded research in the future. If so, the achievements coming out of the 2 year stimulus experiment will be of intense interest."
