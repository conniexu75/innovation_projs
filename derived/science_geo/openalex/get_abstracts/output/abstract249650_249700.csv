We examined the effects of this inflammatory state on 3T3-L1 preadipocyte development and differentiation to mature adipose cells. Both IL-6 and TNFα impaired the normal differentiation pattern and lipid accumulation. However, IL-6 allowed a normal early induction of differentiation with inhibition of Wnt10b and Pref-1, whereas expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, in contrast to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, was markedly reduced. TNFα also allowed a normal early induction of differentiation, whereas the terminal differentiation to adipose cells was completely prevented. However, both cytokines induced an inflammatory phenotype of the cells but with different profiles. Remarkably, both IL-6 and TNFα maintained and augmented the canonical Wnt signaling associated with low axin and high low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRD), Dishevelled, and β-catenin levels. TNFα, but not IL-6, activated Wnt10b expression, whereas IL-6 increased the apparent phosphorylation of Dishevelled. Thus, both IL-6 and TNFα prevent the normal development of preadipocytes to fully differentiated adipose cells and, instead, promote an inflammatory phenotype of the adipocytes. These results provide an explanation as to why obesity and diabetes are associated with both local and systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and ectopic lipid accumulation. Obesity with enlarged fat cells is associated with high local concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in the adipose tissue.

These results provide an explanation as to why obesity and diabetes are associated with both local and systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and ectopic lipid accumulation. Adipose tissue is the major organ for storing and releasing surplus energy. Inability of the adipose cells to take up and store lipids, as seen in lipoatrophic and lipodystrophic conditions, is associated with the accumulation of ectopic triglycerides in the liver and skeletal muscles, insulin resistance, and diabetes (1Perseghin G. Petersen K. Shulman G.I. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27 (Suppl. 3): S6-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Transplantation of fat to animal models of lipoatrophy reverses these conditions (2Kim J.K. Gavrilova O. Chen Y. Reitman M.L. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8456-8460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Interestingly, obesity and insulin resistance are also associated with ectopic lipid accumulation suggesting an insufficient uptake and storage of lipids in the adipose cells in these conditions, as well. The adipose tissue also plays an important role as an endocrine organ secreting different hormones and cytokines that can augment or impair whole-body insulin sensitivity (3Fukuhara A. Matsuda M. Nishizawa M. Segawa K. Tanaka M. Kishimoto K. Matsuki Y. Murakami M. Ichisaka T. Murakami H. Watanabe E. Takagi T. Akiyoshi M. Ohtsubo T. Kihara S. Yamashita S. Makishima M. Funahashi T. Yamanaka S. Hiramatsu R. Matsuzawa Y. Shimomura I. Science. 2005; 307: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Accumulation of body fat in adults is initially characterized by an increase in fat cell size followed by an increased cell number and, thus, recruitment of preadipocytes (4Kissebah A.H.

Very little is known about factors that regulate the commitment of pluripotent stem cells into the adipose lineage (7Camp H.S. Ren D. Leff T. Trends Mol.

Once committed, the preadipocytes undergo an adipogenic program, which requires a coordinate activation of several pathways initiated by the down-regulation of the inhibitory preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) 2The abbreviations used are: Pref-1, preadipocyte factor-1; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Dvl, Dishevelled; PPRE, PPAR response element; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; Fz, Frizzled; IL-6, interleukin-6, TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; PCNA, proliferation cell nuclear antigen; MAPK, mitogen-activate protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; sFRP2, secreted Frizzled-related protein 2. 2The abbreviations used are: Pref-1, preadipocyte factor-1; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Dvl, Dishevelled; PPRE, PPAR response element; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; Fz, Frizzled; IL-6, interleukin-6, TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; PCNA, proliferation cell nuclear antigen; MAPK, mitogen-activate protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; sFRP2, secreted Frizzled-related protein 2. and Wnt proteins (9Bennett C.N.

J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Induction of the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ2 (PPARγ2) also plays a crucial role in the early differentiation of the preadipocytes into lipid-accumulating cells (8Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Other key transcription factors are the family of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins: C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ. Several loss-of-function studies with cells either lacking PPARγ or C/EBPα have shown an absolute requirement of PPARγ for the induction of differentiation, whereas cells lacking C/EBPα, but expressing PPARγ, can still be induced to accumulate lipids. However, these cells are not the typical insulin-responsive and hormone-secreting adipose cells, because C/EBPα is required for the normal induction of many key adipogenic genes and proteins such as GLUT4, adiponectin, and IRS-1 (12Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 13Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). During preadipocyte differentiation, a carefully coordinated chain of events occurs where one of the earliest transcription factors to be expressed is C/EBPβ. However, due to its association with CHOP-10, C/EBPβ lacks early DNA-binding capacity (14Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Subsequently, C/EBPβ undergoes phosphorylation, achieves DNA-binding capacity, and induces both PPARγ2 and C/EBPα as well as the terminal clonal mitotic expansion (14Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Park B.H. Qiang L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8671-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Tang Q.Q. Gronborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the C/EBPα gene occurs exceptionally late during differentiation, because repressors prevent premature expression of C/EBPα (17Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12519-12523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4855-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Once expressed, C/EBPα activates its own gene through C/EBP binding sites in the promoter. This auto-activation is important for the terminal differentiation and maintained C/EBPα expression in the adipocytes (17Jiang M.S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12519-12523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). C/EBPα is also anti-mitotic, and its expression ends clonal mitotic expansion. At the same time, genes related to the fully differentiated adipocyte are induced. Interleukin (IL)-6 and TNFα are major inflammatory cytokines that have been linked to the development of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes (19Pickup J.C. Mattock M.B. Chusney G.D. Burt D. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). IL-6 is secreted by both adipose cells and inflammatory cells, and high circulating IL-6 levels are related to the future risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in humans (20Mohamed-Ali V. Goodrick S. Rawesh A. Katz D.R. Miles J.M. Yudkin J.S. Klein S. Coppack S.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 4196-4200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, TNFα is only secreted by inflammatory cells, because the prohormone is not processed and cleaved in the adipocytes by the converting enzymes (21Xu H. Uysal K.T. Becherer J.D. Arner P. Hotamisligil G.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1876-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the adipose tissue production of IL-6 in vivo is positively related to the size of the fat cells and that the interstitial concentrations are considerably higher than the circulating plasma levels (22Sopasakis V.R. Sandqvist M. Gustafson B. Hammarstedt A. Schmelz M. Yang X. Jansson P.A. Smith U. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The additional recruitment of macrophages from the blood to the adipose tissue in obesity further creates an inflamed condition (23Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7207) Google Scholar, 24Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). The high interstitial concentrations make it likely that IL-6 is an important paracrine/autocrine regulator of the preadipocytes (22Sopasakis V.R. Sandqvist M. Gustafson B. Hammarstedt A. Schmelz M. Yang X. Jansson P.A. Smith U. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effects of IL-6 at concentrations found to be present in the adipose tissue in obesity (22Sopasakis V.R. Sandqvist M. Gustafson B. Hammarstedt A. Schmelz M. Yang X. Jansson P.A. Smith U. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), as well as TNFα, on the preadipocyte differentiation process using the well characterized 3T3-L1 cells. Materials—All chemicals were of high quality and obtained from commercial sources. Immunoblots were performed with the following antibodies; p18 (N-20), p107 (C-18), p130 (C-20), proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (PC10), p21-activated kinase (N-20), C/EBPα (14AA), C/EBPβ (C-19), activator protein (AP2)α (C-18), Sp1 (E-3), p-αp21-activated kinase (Thr 423), PPARγ (H-100), Axin (H-98), dishevelled (Dvl)-1 (3F12) (all from Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), MAPK (06-182) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), Perilipin (PROGP29), and LRP6 (AF1505) (R&D Systems, Inc.), Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA and New England Biolabs Ltd., UK), and Bcl-2 and β-catenin (BD Transduction). Cell Culture Conditions—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. After 2 days of confluence, the cells were treated with MDI (0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 865 nm insulin) for 48 h, followed by insulin alone for an additional 48 h. Cytokines (IL-6, mainly 20 ng/ml, and TNFα, mainly 1.5 ng/ml) and/or pioglitazone (1 μm) were added to the differentiation mixture and to cell culture media during the 8 (or longer) days of differentiation as indicated. To examine lipid accumulation, cells cultured in 6-well plates (Nunc, A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) were fixed with formalin and stained with Oil Red O. For photomicrographs, the cells were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Optical density for Oil Red O was determined by washing the stained cells with dH2O, and, after removal of all water, 1 ml of isopropanol was added for 10 min, and the optical density was measured in a plate reader at 510 nm. DNA synthesis was assessed by monitoring incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine using immunocytochemistry with the Cell Proliferation Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were plated on 1-well chamber slides (Nunc, A/S) and allowed to reach confluence before treatment with MDI with or without the cytokine. After induction of differentiation (1, 2, 4, and 6 days) the cells were incubated for 1 h with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine prior to detection, and the number of positive cells per 1000 cells was identified. PPRE, C/EBP, and NFY-A Binding Assays—DNA-binding capacity in nuclear extracts of PPARγ to PPRE (TransAM PPARγ ELISA), C/EBPα and C/EBPβ to C/EBP binding sites (TransAM C/EBPβ/α ELISA), and NFY-A binding to NFY-A binding sites (TransAM NFY-A ELISA, all from ActiveMotif, Rixensart, Belgium), were measured as described by the manufacturer. Whole Cell Extracts and Western Blots—3T3-L1 cells, cultured in 25-cm2 flasks, were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride. The insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and frozen at -80 °C. Protein content was determined using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). 25-50 μg of whole cell extracts were used for electrophoresis through either 7.5% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGEr, Cambrex, Biosciences Inc.) and transferred to BA85 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, BioScience Gmbh, Germany). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% dry milk in Tris-saline (T/S) buffer (10 mm Tris-base, 0.154 m NaCl, and 1% Tween 20). After washing in T/S buffer, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h. For detection, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h, and the bands were visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (25Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 cells from one 75-cm2 flask were washed, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g. The pelleted cells were dissolved in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and homogenized in a tight homogenizer. The homogenate was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 10 min and washed twice with buffer. High salt extraction of nuclear proteins was performed by incubation of nuclei with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25% sucrose) for 30 min on ice. The nuclei were pelleted at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was frozen at -80 °C prior to analyses. Protein content was determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR—RNA was isolated from the cultured cells with RNeasy (Qiagen Gmbh, Hilden Germany). Gene expression was analyzed with the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Gene-specific primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and the sequences used are available on request. The real-time PCR reaction was essentially performed as recommended using 100 nm probe, 200 nm of both forward and reverse primers, and 10 ng of total RNA in a final volume of 20 μl. The standard curve method or relative quantification of mRNA levels was plotted as -fold change, generally compared with day 0 (initiation of adipogenesis) when additions were made. 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). Analyses were performed in duplicates, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. Statistical Analyses—Conventional statistical methods were used to calculate means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare differential gene expression and transcription factor binding between untreated and cytokine-treated samples. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. IL-6, Like TNFα, Reduces Lipid Accumulation and Supports a Proliferative State—In the presence of IL-6, there was a marked inhibition in the early lipid accumulation (4 days) (Fig. 1, A and C) and a clear reduction (20-30%, p < 0.05) in the Oil Red O accumulation was also seen after 8 days (Fig. 1, B and D) as well as after 11 days (data not shown). In addition, many of the preadipocytes maintained a fibroblast-like appearance in the presence of IL-6 (Fig. 1, E and F). Also these fibroblast-like cells accumulated lipids, albeit to a much lesser extent. In the presence of IL-6, the cells were significantly larger (19.4%), although they contained less lipids, were less adherent to the surface, and exhibited a higher migration rate that resulted in cluster formations (see supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), which were obvious 4-6 days after induction of differentiation. Addition of the PPARγ ligand, pioglitazone, made the cells round up and accumulate more lipids but the cluster formation remained (see supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). These morphological changes induced by IL-6 suggest that the cells remain in a proliferative state. This was further confirmed by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine labeling, which was elevated also at differentiation day 6 (not shown). The IL-6-stimulated proliferation was also associated with an increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, both in the presence and absence of pioglitazone (see supplemental Fig. S2). Together, these data show that the presence of IL-6 both delayed and reduced the cellular lipid accumulation and, in addition, altered the cell morphology and size as well as the migration pattern during the adipocyte differentiation process. We also examined the effect of TNFα on the differentiation pattern. This cytokine was more potent than IL-6 and virtually no lipid accumulation (<5% of the cells) was seen in the presence of as low a concentration as 1.5 ng/ml (Fig. S1, G and J). Thus, early preadipocytes are highly sensitive to the inhibitory effect of cytokines on differentiation. IL-6 and TNFα Impair the Normal Differentiation Pattern—We then examined the effects of IL-6 on the expression of genes related to the differentiation and development of a normal adipocyte phenotype. Most genes related to adipose cell differentiation and function, such as adiponectin, resistin, perilipin, and Foxc2 were reduced, whereas aP2, which is mainly regulated by PPARγ, was not reduced (Fig. 2, A-E). Also a number of other important genes induced during differentiation and related to insulin action, lipid synthesis, and uptake, such as glucose transfer 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, c-CBL-associated protein (CAP), fatty acid synthase, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were markedly reduced in the presence of IL-6 (Fig. 2, F-J). In contrast, IL-6 increased the expression of IL-6 itself as well as MCP-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (Fig. 3, A-C). In general, the addition of the PPARγ-ligand abrogated the IL-6 effect and normalized CAP and perilipin; this was also verified at the protein level (see supplemental Fig. S3).FIGURE 3IL-6 and TNFα induces inflammatory markers. A, induction of IL-6. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated for 8 days with or without 20 ng/ml IL-6 or 1.5 ng/ml TNFα. RNA was extracted, and mRNA levels were determined with real-time PCR. The data were first normalized to 18 S rRNA. Then, all mRNA levels were normalized to expression level in the control sample (without cytokines = 1). B, both IL-6 (left bar) and, in particular, TNFα (right bar) dramatically increase expression of MCP-1 mRNA. Differentiation and RNA extraction performed as above. C, IL-6 induces expression of PAI-1 (left axis). Differentiation and RNA extraction were performed as above. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. (n = 4-5). *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.002, compared with untreated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the effect of TNFα which, in addition to the ablated lipid accumulation, also completely prevented the normal differentiation (discussed later). However, the expression of chemo- and cytokines like IL-6 and MCP-1 was dramatically increased (Fig. 3, A-C) and considerably more than for IL-6, whereas specific macrophage markers like F4/80 and MAC-1 were not induced (data not shown). TNFα, in contrast to IL-6, did not show an increase but actually decreased PAI-1 expression (Fig. 3C). The Early Induction of Adipocyte Differentiation Is Not Altered by IL-6—Because IL-6 (like TNFα) exerts such profound effects on the growth and differentiation of the preadipocytes, we set out to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Down-regulation of Pref-1 is required for preadipocytes to undergo adipose conversion. However, Pref-1 mRNA was decreased within hours after induction of differentiation whether or not IL-6 was present (Fig. 4A). Wnt signaling and secretion also play a key role for maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated state (11Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, also Wnt10b mRNA, previously shown to inhibit adipocyte differentiation (26Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar), declined rapidly upon induction of differentiation whether or not IL-6 was present (Fig. 4B). We also measured Wnt1 and Wnt3a, but these ligands were not expressed under any conditions used (data not shown). Activation of the retinoblastoma family proteins, p130 and p107, is directly correlated with the entry into the clonal mitotic expansion phase. Following induction of differentiation, the expression of these proteins is switched with an increase in p107 and a decrease in p130 (27Liu K. Guan Y. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. McGehee Jr., R.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 194: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Iakova P. Albrecht J.H. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3621-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Again, IL-6 did not interfere with the normal p130/p107 switch (Fig. 4C). Thus, IL-6 did not interfere with these critical initial steps required for the induction of differentiation. Clonal Mitotic Expansion—C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are expressed immediately after induction of differentiation. Initially, C/EBPβ is inactivated by binding to CHOP-10, a dominant-negative member of the C/EBP family. However, CHOP-10 decreases rapidly and C/EBPβ is released (29Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12446-12450Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). IL-6, like TNFα (data not shown), did not alter the normal down-regulation of CHOP-10, and the mRNA levels remained low until the cells had entered the stage of terminal differentiation (Fig. 4D). Binding activity of C/EBPβ and -δ coincides with the entry of the preadipocytes into the S phase of the cell cycle and the onset of clonal mitotic expansion. C/EBPδ gene expression peaked after ∼24 h, and was similar whether or not IL-6 was present (Fig. 4E), while C/EBPβ mRNA was slightly, but significantly (p < 0.05), increased in the presence of IL-6 but showed a similar time course as the control cells (Fig. 4E). Neither C/EBPβ activating (LAP) or inhibitory (LIP) proteins in nuclear extracts (Fig. 4F), nor phosphorylation (data not shown), were altered by the presence of IL-6. To further verify that C/EBPβ was not changed by IL-6 we examined the binding to C/EBP-binding sites. However, specific binding by nuclear extracts prepared for up to 72 h after induction of differentiation was also not altered by the presence of IL-6 (data not shown). Similarly, TNFα did not inhibit the early induction of either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ (data not shown). PPARγ, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ Induction Is Normal, whereas C/EBPα Expression Is Reduced by IL-6—An absolute requirement for adipogenesis and lipid accumulation is expression of the PPARγ isoforms (12Rosen E.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), PPARγ1 and PPARγ2; the latter only being expressed in the adipose cells. Both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are activators of the PPARγ gene, but, once expressed, there is feedback activation between C/EBPα and PPARγ through C/EBP regulatory elements in the PPARγ promoter (29Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We analyzed the binding of PPARγ in nuclear extracts to PPRE during the initial 72 h of differentiation (Fig. 5A). This was not altered by the presence of IL-6, also supported by the finding that induction for both PPARγ1 and -2 proteins was normal (Fig. 5B). After a delay of ∼30 h after the induction of differentiation, C/EBPα is transactivated by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ through C/EBP regulatory elements in the C/EBPα promoter (31Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PPARγ also induces transactivation of C/EBPα through PPRE in the C/EBPα promoter. C/EBPα gene expression peaked at 96 h (Fig. 5C), and this late activation corresponds to induction of terminal differentiation and the anti-mitotic effect of C/EBPα (31Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The induction of C/EBPα mRNA expression, 24-48 h and later, was markedly reduced by the presence of IL-6 (Fig. 5C). Similarly, C/EBPα protein expression in whole cell lysates (data not shown), as well as in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5B), was reduced by ∼50-70%. Addition of pioglitazone did not prevent the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on C/EBPα gene activation (Fig. 5C), whereas the protein expression was clearly increased (Fig. 5B). The binding of C/EBPα in nuclear extracts to the C/EBP binding sites was markedly decreased 48 h and later during the differentiation process (Fig. 5D). Protein dilution experiments (data not shown) indicated that nuclear extracts from IL-6-exposed cells contained one or more factors that altered the normal binding of C/EBPα, but the nature of this remains to be identified. These data show that the early process leading to the induction of differentiation and activation of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and PPARγ2 are not altered by IL-6, whereas the b"

G9a is a histone H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase localized in euchromatin and acts as a corepressor for specific transcription factors. Here we demonstrate that G9a also functions as a coactivator for nuclear receptors, cooperating synergistically with nuclear receptor coactivators glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), and p300 in transient transfection assays. This synergy depends strongly on the arginine-specific protein methyltransferase activity of CARM1 but does not absolutely require the enzymatic activity of G9a and is specific to CARM1 and G9a among various protein methyltransferases. Reduction of endogenous G9a diminished hormonal activation of an endogenous target gene by the androgen receptor, and G9a associated with regulatory regions of this same gene. G9a fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain can repress transcription in a lysine methyltransferase-dependent manner; however, the histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation can inhibit the methyltransferase activity of G9a. These findings suggest a link between histone arginine and lysine methylation and a mechanism for controlling whether G9a functions as a corepressor or coactivator.

These findings suggest a link between histone arginine and lysine methylation and a mechanism for controlling whether G9a functions as a corepressor or coactivator. Activation and repression of transcription involve the recruitment of many coregulator (coactivator or corepressor) proteins to the regulated gene promoter by sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors (1McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These coregulator proteins contribute to transcriptional regulation by helping to remodel chromatin conformation in the promoter of the gene and by influencing the recruitment and activation of RNA polymerase II and its associated basal transcription factors. The mechanisms by which coregulators accomplish these tasks include protein-protein interactions, ATP-dependent alterations in conformations of chromatin, and catalysis of post-translational modifications of histones and other protein components of the transcription machinery.Post-translational modifications of the N-terminal tails of histones include acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and arginine and lysine methylation. Individual histone modifications or sequential or concurrent combinations of these modifications may constitute a histone code, which is then recognized by effector proteins to bring about distinct changes in chromatin structure or other aspects of transcription complex assembly and activity (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar). Methylation of histones on various lysine and arginine residues has been found to play both positive and negative roles in transcriptional regulation. For example, methylation of Lys-9 of histone H3 is associated with inactive genes, whereas methylation of Lys-4 and Arg-17 of histone H3 has been generally associated with active or potentially active genes (4Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Lysine residues can be modified to mono-, di-, or trimethyl states; arginine can be modified to a monomethyl, asymmetric dimethyl, or symmetric dimethyl state. It appears that different degrees of methylation may be associated with distinct chromatin regions or transcriptional states. Trimethylation of Lys-9 of histone H3 is associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin and transcriptional repression, whereas dimethylation of Lys-9 appears to occur on repressed genes in euchromatin. However, these general rules, which represent our current level of understanding, may require some refinement if various histone modifications are indeed interpreted in combinations as part of a histone code.Nuclear receptors (NR) 3The abbreviations used are: NR, nuclear receptor; GRIP1, glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1; CARM1, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1; PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; AD, activation domain; AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; SET, Su(var), Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax; ANK, ankyrin repeats; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; HA, hemagglutinin A; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; RLU, relative light units; DBD, DNA binding domain; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 3The abbreviations used are: NR, nuclear receptor; GRIP1, glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1; CARM1, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1; PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; AD, activation domain; AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; SET, Su(var), Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax; ANK, ankyrin repeats; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; HA, hemagglutinin A; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; RLU, relative light units; DBD, DNA binding domain; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. are ligand-activated, DNA binding transcription factors. Among the many coactivators that NRs recruit to the promoters of their target genes, one critical coactivator complex contains a member of the p160 coactivator family, which includes steroid receptor coactivator 1, GRIP1, and AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1). p160 coactivators bind to NRs in a ligand-dependent manner and use at least three different activation domains to recruit additional coactivators (5Stallcup M.R.

The histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP bind to AD1 of p160 coactivators, whereas the histone arginine methyltransferases CARM1 and PRMT1 bind to AD2 (6Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V.

In addition, several coactivators with no apparent enzymatic activity (e.g. CoCoA, Fli-I, and GAC63) bind to AD3 in the N-terminal region of p160 coactivators (10Chen Y.H. Kim J.H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5965-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Methylation of arginine residues 2, 17, and 26 of histone H3 by CARM1 and Arg-3 of histone H4 by PRMT1 occurs during hormone-dependent transcriptional activation by NRs (11Ma H. Baumann C.T. Li H.

Various combinations of these coactivators can cooperate synergistically to enhance transcriptional activation of NRs in transient transfection as well as chromatin-based in vitro transcription systems. For example, p300 and CBP cooperate synergistically with CARM1, and their enzymatic histone modifications are required for transcriptional activation and occur in a requisite sequence (13Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In contrast, histone modifications associated with repression and those associated with activation are often mutually inhibitory (15Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.-W. Schmid M.

Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).Here we test functional relationships between coregulators that make activating and repressive histone modifications. G9a is the major euchromatic histone H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase in higher eukaryotes and is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of Lys-9 of histone H3 in euchromatin (17Tachibana M. Sugimoto K.

Previous studies found that G9a functions as a corepressor which can be targeted to specific genes by associating with transcriptional repressors and corepressors such as CDP/cut, Blimp-1/PRDI-BF1, and REST/NRSF (19Nishio H. Walsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11257-11262Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Gyory I. Wu J. Fejer G. Seto E. Wright K.L. Nat.

Cell. 2004; 14: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Here we show, surprisingly, that G9a functions as a coactivator for NRs, collaborating synergistically with CARM1 and other NR coactivators. We also tested the role of the enzymatic activities of G9a and CARM1 in their synergistic coactivator function, and we investigated potential regulatory mechanisms for the histone lysine methyltransferase activity of G9a. Our results suggest that promoter context and/or regulatory environment control whether G9a functions as a corepressor or a coactivator.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Proteins with N-terminal hemagglutinin A or FLAG epitope tags were expressed in mammalian cells and in vitro from pSG5.HA or pSG5.FLAG, each of which has SV40 and T7 promoters (8Chen D.

G9a H1166K mutant was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pSG5.HA-G9a as the template.

CV-1 cells (5 × 104/well) were seeded into 12-well dishes 18 h before transfection with a total of 1 μg/well DNA using Targefect F-1 (Targeting Systems) (8Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M.

After transfection, cells were grown in 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts) for 48 h in the absence or presence of 20 nm dihydrotestosterone for AR or 20 nm estradiol for ER. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) as described previously (8Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R.

GRIP1 fragments GRIP1.N, GRIP1.M, GRIP1.C were cloned into the vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for expression. 35S-Labeled G9a was synthesized in vitro by transcription and translation using the TNT-T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (9Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.-H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol.

Further antibodies used for immunoblotting were anti-G9a (Sigma), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-PSA (DAKO Corp.).Small Interfering RNA Transfection and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 2 days in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with 90 nm siRNA using siLentFect (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Starting 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm DHT for 20 h. Total cellular RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen), and a two-step reverse transcription-PCR method was used to quantify specific mRNAs. Total RNA (400 ng) was subjected to reverse transcription (iScript cDNA synthesis kit, Bio-Rad) followed by quantitative PCR with Brilliant SYBR Green PCR master mix and the Mx3000P system (Stratagene). The primer sequences for quantitative PCR are as follows: hG9a, 5′-GAGGTGTACTGCATAGATGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGACGGCTCTGCTCCAGGGC-3′ (reverse); hβ-actin, 5′-ACCCCATCGAGCACGGCATCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCACCGGAGTCCATCACGATG-3′ (reverse); human PSA, 5′-TCACAGCTACCCACTGCATCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGTCGTGGCTGGAGTCATC-3′ (reverse).siRNA sequences are as follows (Dharmacon): siG9a, 5′-UGAGAGAGGAUGAUUCUUAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAAGAAUCAUCCUCUCUCAUU-3′ (antisense); siControl (negative control siRNA having no perfect matches to known human or mouse genes), 5′-UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUACUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-GUAUCUCUUCAUAGCCUUAUU-3′ (antisense).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described (26Ma H.

Cross-linked and sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-G9a (Sigma), or normal rabbit IgG. Quantitative PCR amplifications were performed as described above using the following primers representing different portions of the human PSA gene: enhancer forward, 5′-GGGGTTTGTGCCACTGGTGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGAGGCAATTCTCCATGGTT-3′; enhancer-promoter forward, 5′-TAGAAGACGTGGAAGTAGCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-AACCTCATGGATCCGGTGTCC-3′; promoter forward, 5′-TCTAGTTTCTGGTCTCAGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGCTGTTCTGCAATTACTAG-3′; intron 1 forward, 5′-CCAAGGACCTCTCTCAATGC-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGGAATGAGGAGTTCTCAG-3′; exon 3 forward, 5′-CACACCCGCTCTACGATATGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGCTCGGCAGGCTCTGACAG-3′;3′ UTR (untranslated region) forward, 5′-TACTGGCCATGCCTGGAGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGCTCACAGCCTTCTCTAG-3.Methyltransferase Assays—Bacterially produced GST fusion proteins of full-length CARM1 or G9a residues 730–1263 (mouse long form) were incubated with histone H3 tail peptides (amino acids 1–21, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) containing various post-translational modifications in the presence of 3H-labeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Radioactive methylated products were analyzed by standard denaturing SDS gel electrophoresis using 15% (acrylamide/Bis, 29:1) gels and autofluorography.RESULTSWe first tested whether the histone H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase G9a can enhance or inhibit transcriptional activation of transiently transfected reporter plasmids by steroid hormone receptors in CV-1 cells. We used previously established conditions that allow synergistic effects of multiple coactivators to be observed (13Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Reporter gene expression mediated by hormone-activated AR and ERα (Fig. 1, A and B) was enhanced by GRIP1 and further enhanced by CARM1. G9a alone exhibited little coactivator activity, but it cooperated strongly with GRIP1; furthermore, the combination of G9a, GRIP1, and CARM1 was highly synergistic, producing an activity level up to 20-fold higher than that achieved with GRIP1 and CARM1. The synergy was entirely dependent on the steroid hormone (Fig. 1A) as well as GRIP1 (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained with glucocorticoid receptor (Supplemental Fig. S1) and thyroid hormone receptor β1 (data not shown). G9a cooperated synergistically with selective combinations of coactivators. In the presence of GRIP1, G9a was highly synergistic with CARM1, but not with p300; however, the addition of G9a to the combination of GRIP1, CARM1, and p300 produced a dramatic synergy (Fig. 1C). Thus, although G9a cooperated with GRIP1, CARM1, and p300, its coactivator function was more highly dependent on GRIP1 and CARM1.To test the requirement for CARM1 enzymatic activity in its synergistic action with G9a, we used two mutants of CARM1 that lack enzymatic activity in vitro; mutation of VLD (amino acids 189–191) to AAA in the SAM (S-adenosyl-l-methionine) binding domain and the E267Q mutation in the arginine binding pocket. Both mutants maintain the ability to bind to AD2 of GRIP1 and are expressed at wild type levels (8Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 13Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The synergistic enhancement of AR function by GRIP1, wild type CARM1, and G9a was completely lost when either of the two CARM1 mutants was substituted for wild type CARM1 (Fig. 2A). The activity observed with the CARM1 (E267Q) mutation was equivalent to that observed with no CARM1, whereas the CARM1 (VLD) mutant displayed a dominant negative behavior. Thus, the enzymatic activity of CARM1 is required for the coactivator synergy between G9a and CARM1.FIGURE 2The methyltransferase activity of CARM1 but not that of G9a is required for coactivator synergy. A and B, CV-1 cells were transfected with MMTV-LUC reporter plasmid (125 ng) and with expression vectors encoding AR (10 ng), GRIP1 (50 ng), CARM1 wild type or mutant (200 ng), and G9a wild type or mutant (50, 100, 200, and 400 ng). Cells were treated with 20 nm DHT before luciferase assays. The schematic diagram shows full-length G9a and the residue numbering of fragments used in this study. E, polyglutamate; Cys, cysteine-rich region; ANK, six ankyrin repeats; Pre and Post, SET domains; SET, H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase domain; asterisk, location of H1166K mutation in the SET domain. C, Cos-7 cells were transfected with the G9a expression vectors used in panel B above. Whole-cell extracts were analyzed for G9a expression by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. D, CV-1 cells were transfected with GK1 reporter plasmid (250 ng) and expression vectors encoding Gal4 DBD (vector) or Gal4 DBD fused to various G9a fragments (250 ng each). After 48 h cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity. The inset graph shows the same results on a different scale without assay 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the histone lysine methyltransferase activity of G9a is required for its synergistic cooperation with CARM1, we used mutants that lack the enzymatic activity in vitro; that is, mutation H1166K in the catalytic site of the SET domain or deletion of the entire SET domain. The synergistic coactivator function observed with GRIP1, CARM1, and wild type G9a was reduced but not eliminated when G9a (H1166K) or G9a (ΔSET) was substituted for wild type G9a (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a G9a fragment consisting of the SET domain alone and missing the ankyrin repeats (ΔANK) was inactive as a coactivator. The G9a (H1166K) and G9a (ΔSET) mutants were less efficient than wild type G9a when lower levels of the plasmids were transfected but were almost equivalent to wild type G9a when higher levels of plasmid were transfected. Although the G9a mutants are expressed at approximately wild type levels when overexpressed in Cos-7 cells (Fig. 2C), we cannot rule out the possibility that modest reductions in their expression levels may account for the lower activities observed in Fig. 2B. Thus, the methyl-transferase activity of G9a is not absolutely required for, but may contribute to, the synergistic coactivator function of G9a with CARM1.We next tested whether any part of G9a, when brought to a promoter, could activate transcription. Fig. 2D shows the results of cotransfecting fragments of G9a fused to the Gal4 DBD with a Gal4-responsive reporter gene. The fragment containing G9a residues 72–333 contains an autonomous activation domain, whereas no other isolated fragment of the protein has such an activity. Interestingly, the first 71 residues of the protein appear to have a negative effect on this autonomous activity (compare assays 2 and 3, Fig. 2D).To further define the specificity of the synergy between CARM1 and G9a, we tested various combinations of arginine and lysine methyltransferases in the transient transfection assays. The coactivator synergy between G9a and CARM1 was not observed when mammalian arginine methyltransferase PRMT1, PRMT2, or PRMT3 or yeast RMT1 was substituted for CARM1 (Fig. 3A). Each of these arginine methyltransferases exhibited similar coactivator activity when assayed with GRIP1 (13Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). PRMT1 and PRMT3 methylate histone H4 on Arg-3 among other substrates (4Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mammalian histone H4 Lys-20 methyltransferase PR-SET7 could not be substituted for G9a (Fig. 3B), although both proteins can be expressed at high levels (Fig. 3C). Thus, among various histone methyltransferases, CARM1 and G9a have specific characteristics that allow them to function with each other as synergistic coactivators.FIGURE 3Specificity of coactivator synergy among protein arginine and lysine methyltransferases. A and B, CV-1 cells were transfected with MMTV-LUC reporter plasmid (125 ng) and with plasmids encoding AR (10 ng), GRIP1 (50 ng), CARM1, PRMT1, PRMT2, PRMT3, or RMT1 (200 ng), and HA-tagged G9a or PR-SET7 (50, 100, 200, and 400 ng). Cells were treated with 20 nm DHT, and luciferase assays were performed. C, Cos-7 cells were transfected with the G9a and PR-SET7 vectors used in panel B or mock-transfected. Whole-cell extracts were analyzed for protein expression by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because GRIP1 was important for the synergy between CARM1 and G9a, we explored physical interactions between G9a and specific GRIP1 domains. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, G9a bound strongly to GRIP1.N (5–765) but not to the middle or C-terminal regions of GRIP1 (Fig. 4A). The interaction of G9a with GRIP1.N was apparently indirect or required post-translational modification, because no binding was observed between G9a translated in vit"

The results reveal shared as well as distinctive features of adult gut stem cells when compared with other stem cell populations. The adult gastrointestinal tracts of humans and mice contain large populations of multipotential stem cells that produce an impressive number of descendant epithelial cells each day: ∼70 billion in humans (∼0.25 kg) and 200 million in mice (1Croft D.N. Cotton P.B. Digestion. 1973; 8: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Potten C.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The morphologic features of adult mouse gut epithelial lineage progenitors have been characterized using tritiated thymidine labeling and electron microscopic autoradiography (3Cheng H. Leblond C.P.

In the stomach, the stem cell niche is positioned in the mid-portion (isthmus) of tubular mucosal invaginations known as gastric units, whereas small intestinal and colonic stem cells reside at or near the base of crypts of Lieberkühn (4Karam S.M.

Analyses of genetic mosaic mice indicate that adult gastric units and intestinal crypts are monoclonal; all epithelial cells in each of these anatomically distinct structures are apparently derived from a single ancestor occupying the highest position in the stem cell hierarchy (6Bjerknes M.

Knock-out mice have provided direct evidence that the Wnt pathway is important for maintaining a dividing small intestinal stem cell population, and that Notch signaling is involved in specification of its descendant secretory cell lineages (9Radtke F.

Nonetheless, we know relatively little about the signaling and metabolic pathways that are active in adult gastric and intestinal stem cells within their niches, the degree to which these progenitors share properties with one another, and how they compare with other characterized adult or embryonic stem cell populations. To address this issue, we have sequenced cDNA libraries prepared from laser capture microdissected adult gastric and small intestinal epithelial progenitors (GEPs 3The abbreviations used are: GEP, gastric epithelial progenitor; EST, expressed sequence tag; GO, Gene Ontology; SiEP, small intestinal epithelial progenitor; Atp4b, noncatalytic β-subunit of H+/K+-ATPase; Defcr2, cryptdin-2; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate; LCM, laser capture microdissection; IPA, ingenuity pathways analysis; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Dcamkl1, double cortin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-like-1; Mapk14, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14; CgA, chromogranin A; GSII, Griffonia simplificolia II; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; ESC, embryonic stem cell; NSC, neural stem cell; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A; Vegf, vascular endothelial growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ddc, dopa decarboxylase; Aoc3, amine oxidase, copper containing 3; Aldh9a1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family, member A1; Gad1, glutamic acid decarboxylase 1; IPA, Ingenunity Pathways Analysis. ; SiEPs), taking advantage of two gnotobiotic transgenic mouse models where these cells are represented in increased numbers in discrete regions of gastric units and crypts of Lieberkühn.

Wild-type C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained free of specified pathogens in micro-isolator cages within a barrier facility and fed the same autoclaved chow as their germ-free counterparts. These conventionally raised C57BL/6J mice (10 weeks old) were given a 2.5% aqueous solution of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS; TDB Consultancy AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for 7 days as drinking water to induce a regenerative epithelial response in colonic crypts (15Pull S.L.

Cells were harvested using a PixCell IIe LCM System and CapSure HS LCM caps (Arcturus Bioscience). Total cellular RNA was extracted (10,000 cells/LCM population; PicoPure RNA isolation kit; Arcturus Bioscience), and its quality was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Construction of cDNA Libraries—Detailed protocols and explanatory figures with the sequences of primers used for cDNA synthesis and library construction are available from the authors and in Ref. 17Hawkins R.D. Bashiardes S. Helms C.A. Hu L. Saccone N.L. Warchol M.E. Lovett M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. cDNA was synthesized from 5 ng of RNA on oligo(dT)-linked paramagnetic beads (Dynal Norway) in the presence of a modified “SMART” oligonucleotide (Clontech). Oligonucleotide dimers were removed by digestion with NotI. Bead-linked cDNA was amplified by PCR (four cycles) using the SMART primer and a hybrid primer consisting of oligo(dT) linked to an external and more specific priming site. The original bead-linked cDNAs were captured magnetically and stored. Amplified cDNAs in the supernatant were subsequently amplified for an additional seven cycles of PCR using the more specific external priming sites. cDNA products were passed through a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). A final round of PCR amplification (five cycles) was performed after adding ligation-independent linkers compatible with the uracil deglycosylase system (Invitrogen). The final cDNA products were size-selected (SizeSep 400 Spun Column; Amersham Biosciences) to isolate fragments >300 bp. 10-20 ng of this cDNA were used in a standard annealing mix with the UDG pAMP1 vector (Invitrogen). Aliquots of the ligation-free annealing mix were transformed directly into Escherichia coli DH10B. The GEP, SiEP, and colonic crypt transit amplifying cell libraries each contained >5 × 105 independent clones with mean insert lengths of 0.7 kb. Alignments of ESTs to the Mouse Genome—ESTs were aligned to the mm5 assembly of the mouse genome from University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) with BLAT (gfClient version 27 × 1 obtained from UCSC) using minScore = 50 (minimum score, BLAT default scoring scheme) and minIdentity = 95 (minimum percent identity). The alignments were then filtered using minScore = 50 (on a match = 1, mismatch = -1, and gapOpen = -4 scoring scheme), minMatch = 50 (minimum number of matching bases), and minAli = 200 (minimum ratio of query in parts per thousand). The top scoring alignment for each EST was chosen from this filtered set of alignments, along with any alignment of the EST that scored within 5% of the top scoring alignment. These alignments were subsequently filtered to include only those that contained introns. Gene symbols obtained from the EST alignments to mm5 and consensus gene clustering from Unigene can be found online at genome.wustl.edu/GSCGAP/. Similar data sets were obtained when transcripts from the GEP and SiEP libraries were aligned to mm5 using BLASTN (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). A subsequent, more refined alignment with EST_GENOME (19Mott R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 477-478PubMed Google Scholar) provided confident intron-exon boundaries. Transcripts that crossed splice boundaries were annotated as likely intron retention events; each group of consistent splice patterns was put into a given cluster, and each cluster, along with its individual members and their library association, was annotated. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA)—We analyzed our data sets using the following procedures. Once logged onto the IPA system, we clicked on “File” menu, then “New,” and then “Analysis.” We then clicked “Upload” and selected the data set to be analyzed. For the analysis of canonical signaling and metabolic pathways active in GEPs and SiEPs, the input was the Entrez Gene identifiers of an EST library (e.g. GEPs) with the genes in a data set of interest (e.g. the uniquely GO-enriched genes expressed in GEPs) designated as focus genes. Because we had EST rather than DNA microarray data, we set the expression value to zero for all genes. We clicked on “Create Analysis” followed by “Run Analysis.” When the analysis was completed by IPA software, we clicked on “Canonical Pathways” and “Customize Chart,” and under “Select Categories to Display” we chose both “Metabolic Pathways” and “Signaling Pathways.” Under “Select Sort Order” we ranked by “Significance” and completed the procedure by clicking “Apply.” For the transcriptional networks in GEPs and SiEPs, the input was the transcription-related GO-enriched GEP or SiEP Entrez Gene identifiers. When the analysis was completed by IPA software, we clicked on “Networks,” selected the top two scoring networks, and clicked “View Networks.” The results presented in this study are based on IPA Knowledge Base content statistics from May, 2005. Multilabel Immunohistochemistry—Sections (7 μm thick) were prepared from paraffin-embedded, Bouin's fixed stomach (corpus region) and zinc-formalin fixed small intestine harvested from normal, 12-week-old conventionally raised FVB/N mice and/or comparably aged germ-free Atpb4-tox176 animals. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) 1.5 h prior to sacrifice. Sections were sequentially passed through xylene (three washes; 5 min each), 100% isopropyl alcohol (three washes; 5 min each), and deionized water (5 min). Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling slides in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min, followed by cooling to 23 °C, three washes in PBS (5 min each), and incubation in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS; 30 min). Sections were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies and/or biotinylated lectins: (i) rabbit anti-mouse double cortin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-like-1 (Dcamkl1; final dilution in blocking buffer = 1:200; a gift from Christopher Walsh, Harvard Medical School); (ii) rabbit anti-mouse mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (Mapk14/p38; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (iii) goat anti-BrdUrd (1:500; see Refs. 12Mills J.C.

After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, sections were washed with PBS (three cycles; 5 min each), and antigen-antibody complexes and bound biotinylated lectins were detected with Alexa Fluor-, cyanine (Cy)3-, or fluorescein isothio-cyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies or streptavidin (Molecular Probes and Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sections were washed in PBS, incubated with bisbenzamide (Hoechst 33258; 1 μg/ml) to stain nuclei, and then examined and photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope.

The five most basal crypt epithelial cells in Defcr2-tox176 mice were harvested by LCM of cryosections prepared from the junction between the middle and distal thirds of the small intestine (n = three Defcr2-tox176 mice; total of ∼5,000 LCM crypts). A generally applicable method was employed to generate GEP and SiEP cDNA libraries starting with 5 ng of total cellular RNA from each LCM progenitor population. This method minimizes skewing of the relative abundance of expressed transcripts. Alignments of 36,641 sequenced ESTs from the two libraries to Unigene and the mm5 build of the mouse genome yielded a data set of 4031 genes expressed in GEPs and 3324 genes in SiEPs (see supplemental Table S1; a complete list is available at genome.wustl.edu/GSCGAP/ see supplemental Table S2 for a list of 52 identified alternatively spliced variants).

Bioinformatics. 2004; 3: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to compare each adult gut epithelial progenitor data set with previously sequenced cDNA libraries generated from the intact stomachs and small intestines of conventionally raised, normal adult mice (Fig. 1). The two stomach libraries contained a total of 3303 unique Unigene clusters, whereas the two small intestinal libraries contained 2359 Unigene clusters (supplemental Table S3). GoSurfer takes one or two gene lists as input, finds GO terms associated with the genes, and visualizes them as one of three hierarchical trees corresponding to the broad GO categories of “biological process,” “molecular function,” and “cellular component.” GoSurfer can also compare two gene lists to identify GO terms enriched to a statistically significant degree in one data set versus the other (e.g. supplemental Fig. S1). The following analysis focused on GO terms and pathways that were more prominent in progenitor cells compared with non-stem cell populations. Sixty five biological process GO terms, representing 1767 genes (transcripts), were enriched in the GEP data base over the intact adult stomach cDNA library data set (q value cutoff of 0.1). These 1767 genes, subsumed under enriched GO terms, were termed “GO-enriched.” An analogous GoSurfer comparison of the SiEP data base with the intact adult mouse small intestine cDNA libraries yielded 62 GO terms, representing 1824 genes (q value cutoff of 0.1) (see step 1 in Fig. 1 plus supplemental Tables S4 and S5). The 65 GEP-enriched and 62 SiEP-enriched GO terms are listed in supplemental Tables S6 and S7, respectively, and include the biological processes of cell cycle, DNA replication, cell proliferation, morphogenesis, pattern specification, and ubiquitination. A number of transcription-related GO terms were enriched in the two gut epithelial progenitor populations (see supplemental Tables S8 and S9 for these GO terms and their associated genes, including, for example, Notch 1-4. Note that when molecular function rather than biological process GO terms were used for GoSurfer comparisons, 96% of the transcription-related molecular function GO-enriched genes were identical to the transcription-related biological process GO-enriched genes listed in supplemental Tables S8 and S9). The genes representing these transcription-related GO terms in GEPs and SiEPs were placed onto transcription factor networks using the IPA software tool. This tool utilizes a knowledge base of over one million known functional relationships among proteins. One of the two top scoring networks in GEPs is depicted in Fig. 2A and includes factors involved in Wnt/β-catenin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt kinase (PI3K/Akt), transforming growth factor-β (Tgf-β), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf-1) signaling. Similarly, one of the two top scoring SiEP-associated networks is shown in Fig. 2B and includes factors that participate in JAK/Stat (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling) and cell cycle (G1/S checkpoint) regulation (see supplemental Figs. S2A and S2B for the other top scoring networks in GEPs and SiEPs). Identification of GO-enriched Genes Whose Expression Is Unique to Gut Epithelial Progenitors or Shared with Other Stem Cell Populations—We performed a second step to distinguish GO-enriched genes unique to GEPs or SiEPs from those shared with other non-gut stem cell populations. This analysis employed all published sequenced cDNA libraries of >1000 ESTs from mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs). For HSCs, we combined seven libraries totaling 5018 Unigene clusters with 4191 genes resulting from our alignment to mm5 of a hematopoietic EST data set, available from the Stem Cell Data Base (see SCDb; a joint project of the labs of I. R. Lemischka, K. A. Moore, and C. Stoeckert). For the ESC data set, we incorporated three cDNA libraries with 5259 unique Unigene clusters. For NSCs we used two libraries with 5093 Unigene clusters (supplemental Table S3). Genes producing transcripts in HSCs, ESCs, and NSCs were compared with the adult whole mouse stomach libraries and with the whole small intestinal libraries using GoSurfer. The results disclosed that 243 of the 1767 GEP-associated GO-enriched genes identified from Fig. 1, step 1, were common to the other stem cell populations, whereas 574 were GO-enriched only in GEPs. Among the 1842 SiEP-associated GO-enriched expressed genes, 268 were common, whereas 742 were uniquely GO-enriched in the transcriptomes of this LCM population (Fig. 1, step 3, and supplemental Tables S10-S13). The Venn diagrams in Fig. 1 summarize the results of further comparisons of the groups of filtered GO-enriched commonly and uniquely expressed genes identified in GEPs and SiEPs, including a 253-member group shared by GEPs and SiEPs but not with the other stem cell populations, and a group of 134 shared by GEPs, SiEPs, HSCs, NSCs, and ESCs (see supplemental Tables S14-S19 for complete lists of these genes). To test the validity of this GO enrichment-filtering approach, we analyzed a control population of colonic crypt epithelial cells harvested by LCM from adult conventionally raised C57Bl/6J mice treated for 7 days with DSS in their drinking water. DSS produces a stereotyped pattern of ulcer formation in the distal colonic epithelium and a regenerative proliferative response in crypts surrounding these ulcers (15Pull S.L. Doherty J.M. Mills J.C. Gordon J.I. Stappenbeck T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). EM studies disclosed that the regenerating crypt cells had features of a transit-amplifying population of immature members of the enterocytic and goblet cell lineages (15Pull S.L. Doherty J.M. Mills J.C. Gordon J.I. Stappenbeck T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). A cDNA library was prepared from these LCM cells and sequenced, yielding 12,013 ESTs, representing 2394 unique transcripts (supplemental Table S1). No biological process GO terms were enriched in this set of gene products compared with two adult colonic cDNA libraries with 7470 Unigene clusters (supplemental Table S3). These findings indicate that the GEP and SiEP preparations obtained by LCM of gnotobiotic Atp4b-tox176 and Defcr2-tox176 mouse guts are enriched for adult gut stem cells. Signaling and Metabolic Pathways Active in GEPs and/or SiEPs—We used the IPA tool to further characterize functional properties of these gut epithelial progenitor populations. IPA annotations take into account GO annotations but are nonetheless distinct and based on a knowledge base of protein-protein interactions, extracted from the published literature. The IPA output includes signaling and metabolic pathways and a statistical assessment of their significance. This assessment utilizes a right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test to calculate the probability that genes participate in a given pathway relative to their occurrence in all other pathway annotations. Table 1 lists GEP- and SiEP-associated canonical signaling or meta-bolic pathways. The table is organized based on the groups defined by the Venn diagrams in Fig. 1 and provides a link to the corresponding pathway maps in the supplemental material. These pathway maps contain filtered GO-enriched gene products as well as all other pathway gene products that are present, albeit not enriched, in the gut progenitor EST libraries. For example, our IPA-based analysis indicated that GEPs have a statistically significant representation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling components (Table 1). Fig. 3 illustrates how GEPs and SiEPs, as well as the other stem cell populations, contain different identified combinations of GO-enriched gene products that map to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This provides one measure of the shared and distinctive features of these populations.TABLE 1Canonical signaling and metabolic pathways, defined by IPA, represented in GEPs and SIEPsCanonical signaling/metabolic pathwaysPathway mapsp valueEnriched genes in the pathwayA.

https://openalex.org/W2025541083,"Photodynamic therapy is a promising antitumor treatment modality approved for the management of both early and advanced tumors. The mechanisms of its antitumor action include generation of singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species that directly damage tumor cells and tumor vasculature. A number of mechanisms seem to be involved in the protective responses to PDT that include activation of transcription factors, heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes and antiapoptotic pathways. Elucidation of these mechanisms might result in the design of more effective combination strategies to improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. Using DNA microarray analysis to identify stress-related genes induced by Photofrin-mediated PDT in colon adenocarcinoma C-26 cells, we observed a marked induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Induction of HO-1 with hemin or stable transfection of C-26 with a plasmid vector encoding HO-1 increased resistance of tumor cells to PDT-mediated cytotoxicity. On the other hand, zinc (II) protoporphyrin IX, an HO-1 inhibitor, markedly augmented PDT-mediated cytotoxicity towards C-26 and human ovarian carcinoma MDAH2774 cells. Neither bilirubin, biliverdin nor carbon monoxide, direct products of HO-1 catalysed heme degradation, was responsible for cytoprotection. Importantly, desferrioxamine, a potent iron chelator significantly potentiated cytotoxic effects of PDT. Altogether our results indicate that HO-1 is involved in an important protective mechanism against PDT-mediated phototoxicity and administration of HO-1 inhibitors might be an effective way to potentiate antitumor effectiveness of PDT."

Through microsequencing analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, it was found that a subset of newly synthesized H3.2/H3.3 is modified by acetylation and methylation at sites that correlate with transcriptional competence. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that cytosolic predeposition complexes purified from cells expressing FLAG-H4 contain H3/H4 dimers, not tetramers. Studies of the deposition of newly synthesized H2A/H2B onto replicating and nonreplicating chromatin demonstrated that H2A/H2B exchange takes place in chromatin regions that contain acetylated H4; however, there is no single pattern of H4 acetylation that accompanies exchange. H2A/H2B exchange is also largely independent of the deposition of replacement histone variant, H3.3. Finally, immunoprecipitation of nucleosomes replicated in the absence of de novo nucleosome assembly showed that histone modifications do not prevent the transfer of parental histones to newly replicated DNA and thus have the potential to serve as means of epigenetic inheritance.

Our experiments provide an in-depth analysis of the “histone code” associated with chromatin replication and dynamic histone exchange in human cells. The nuclear DNA of eukaryotic cells is complexed with histone proteins to form the nucleoprotein complex termed chromatin. An octamer of the core histones (two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) is encircled by approximately two turns of DNA to produce the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin.in: Rich A. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Although once widely thought to be primarily involved with DNA packaging, it is now known that histones are fundamental participants in the regulation of dynamic chromatin processes. Transcription, replication, repair, recombination, and silencing can be controlled by the precise alignment of nucleosomes on DNA and by the various posttranslational modifications that histones undergo (including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, and poly(ADP-ribosylation)) (2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999Google Scholar). Most of the posttranslational modifications are clustered on the histone N-terminal (and, in the case of H2A, C-terminal) “tail” domains, which project beyond the surrounding DNA (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin.in: Rich A. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). The modifications constitute a network of interdependent signals, providing controllable marks for the specific targeting of trans-acting factors to chromatin. It has been suggested that histone modifications can provide an epigenetic language, or “histone code,” that modulates the genetic information transmitted in DNA (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6130) Google Scholar, 4Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7149) Google Scholar, 5Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). One of the first demonstrated assignments of a defined histone modification to a specific cellular process involved the acetylation of newly synthesized H4 (6Ruiz-Carrillo A. Wangh L.J. Allfrey V.G. Science. 1975; 190: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jackson V. Shires A. Tanphaichitr N. Chalkley R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Allis C.D.

Biochem. 1984; 142: 329-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During chromatin replication and assembly, new H4 is acetylated at lysines 5 and 12 prior to deposition onto nascent DNA (10Chicoine L.G. Schulman I.G. Richman R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1071-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Deacetylation of new H4 occurs over the next 30-60 min (7Jackson V. Shires A. Tanphaichitr N. Chalkley R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and is required for proper chromatin maturation (12Annunziato A.T. Seale R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12675-12684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The “Lys5/Lys12” acetylation pattern of newly synthesized H4 is highly conserved and has been found in organisms as diverse as protozoa (Tetrahymena), Drosophila, and humans (11Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). (Note that in Tetrahymena, the acetylation sites are at lysines 4 and 11, due to a deletion of the arginine at position 3; also, new H4 in Physarum is predominantly monoacetylated (9Waterborg J.H. Matthews J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 329-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).) Despite this widespread occurrence, the function of H4 acetylation during chromatin biosynthesis remains undefined. Notably, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the lysines at positions 5 and 12 of H4 are inessential for nucleosome assembly, and Lys5, Lys8, and Lys12 act redundantly during histone deposition (13Ma X.J. Wu J.S. Altheim B.A. Schultz M.C. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6693-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the acetylatable lysines of H4 may be required for efficient nuclear import in yeast (14Glowczewski L. Waterborg J.H. Berman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10180-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to the conserved acetylation pattern of new H4, the acetylation of nascent H3 varies among species. For example, in Tetrahymena, Lys9 and Lys14 are the predominant sites, whereas in Drosophila, lysines 14 and 23 are preferred (11Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the lysines at positions 9, 14, 23, and 27 all show some acetylation (with Lys9 and Lys27 preferred), but most new H3 is monoacetylated (15Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that new H3 in S. cerevisiae is acetylated at lysine 56 (16Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The variability of nascent H3 modifications may indicate a nonuniform requirement and/or function for the acetylation of H3 during chromatin assembly. Human cells contain four distinct histone H3 variants, termed H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, and H3.4, which differ only slightly in amino acid sequence (17Albig W. Bramlage B. Gruber K. Klobeck H.G. Kunz J. Doenecke D. Genomics. 1995; 30: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Albig W. Kioschis P. Poustka A. Meergans K. Doenecke D.

Gongidi P. Woods K.R. Jin J.P. Maltais L.J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 487-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major variant (H3.1) is referred to as replication-dependent, because its synthesis rises sharply in S phase and is linked to DNA replication (21Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Cell. 1981; 27: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 22Wu R.S. Tsai S. Bonner W.M. Cell. 1982; 31: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); H3.1 is encoded by 10 genes (19Koessler H. Doenecke D. Albig W. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). H3.2 is also replication-dependent but is encoded by only one gene copy (19Koessler H. Doenecke D. Albig W. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Marzluff W.F. Gongidi P. Woods K.R. Jin J.P. Maltais L.J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 487-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it is distinguished from H3.1 by a single amino acid change at position 96 (cysteine in H3.1, serine in H3.2) (20Marzluff W.F. Gongidi P. Woods K.R. Jin J.P. Maltais L.J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 487-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Franklin S.G. Zweidler A. Nature. 1977; 266: 273-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of the replication-independent variant H3.3 is not coupled to DNA replication but continues at a basal level throughout the cell cycle (21Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Cell. 1981; 27: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 22Wu R.S. Tsai S. Bonner W.M. Cell. 1982; 31: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). H3.3 can be deposited in a replication-independent manner, often in association with transcription (24Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M.D. Lipinski M. Almouzni G. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7102-7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Human H3.4 appears to be expressed solely in testis (32Witt O. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we showed that newly synthesized H3.1 from human (HeLa) cells was essentially unmodified, in contrast to nascent H3 from Tetrahymena, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae (11Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, in that report, we also presented evidence that newly synthesized human H3.2 and/or H3.3 showed detectable acetylation at lysines 14 and 18. In light of the observation that bulk H3.3 is enriched in modifications that are indicative of transcriptional competence (33McKittrick E. Gaften P.R. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 34Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Duncan E.M. Kauer M. Dellaire G. Shabanowitz J. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 559-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), we have more closely examined the modifications of newly synthesized H3.2 and H3.3 in human cells, in this case including the analysis of histone methylation. We have also initiated a characterization of the histone modifications that are present in newly replicated nucleosomes and on parental histones that are segregated to newly replicated DNA (35Annunziato A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12065-12068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In conjunction with these studies, we have investigated the exchange of newly synthesized H2A and H2B into replicating and nonreplicating chromatin regions, through the use of antibodies that recognize specific acetylated H4 isoforms. Our results demonstrate that a subset of new H3 carries modifications that are characteristic of transcriptionally active chromatin immediately following their deposition onto DNA. We also show that specific modifications of parental H3 and H4 can persist through the replication process without preventing the transfer of old histones to new DNA and thus may act as effectors of epigenetic inheritance. It is further demonstrated that the exchange of new H2A/H2B dimers into chromatin is concomitant with the acetylation of H4 and can occur independently of the deposition of new H3.3. Finally, we provide evidence that the human cytosolic H3/H4 predeposition complex contains an H3/H4 dimer (not a tetramer) and that cytosolic H2A can be acetylated at lysine 5. Taken together, our results provide a detailed description of histone modifications during chromatin replication, nucleosome assembly, and H2A/H2B exchange in human cells. Cell Culture and Labeling—HeLa S-3 cells were maintained in spinner culture at 37 °C in minimal essential medium, Joklik modification (MEM), 3The abbreviations used are: MEM, Eagle's minimal essential medium (Joklik modification); HU, hydroxyurea; TSA, trichostatin A; PIPES, Piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TAU, Triton-acid-urea; GFP, green fluorescent protein; acH4, acetylated histone 4. supplemented with 5-10% calf serum.

Cells were then pulse-labeled with l-[4,5-3H]lysine (85 Ci/mol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 8-10 min at 100 μCi/ml, as described (38Chang L. Ryan C.A. Schneider C.A. Annunziato A.T. Wassarman P.M.

To inhibit histone deacetylation, all labeling of DNA and histones was performed in the presence of 50 mm sodium butyrate (39Cousens L.S. Alberts B.M. J. Biol.

To inhibit DNA replication, cells were concentrated 10-fold in warm MEM, preincubated with 10 mm hydroxyurea (HU) for 10 min, and labeled for 15 min in the continuous presence of hydroxyurea (plus sodium butyrate and TSA) (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this concentration of HU effectively inhibits DNA replication in HeLa cells (41Nadeau P. Oliver D.R. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4K. Tong and A. T. Annunziato, unpublished results. To inhibit protein synthesis, cells were concentrated 10-fold in warm MEM, pretreated with 200 μg/ml cycloheximide for 8-10 min, and then labeled with [3H]thymidine at 75 μCi/ml in the presence of cycloheximide for 20 min (37Annunziato A.T.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5431-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Labeling of newly replicated DNA with [3H]TTP in isolated nuclei was performed according to the method of Seale (43Seale R.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2847-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), modified as previously described (44Perry C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13615-13623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to isolating nuclei for in vitro replication, cells were treated with 200 μg/ml cycloheximide for 5 min, to interpose a stretch of unassembled DNA between the last nucleosomes assembled in vivo and the DNA to be labeled in vitro (44Perry C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13615-13623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—An (amino-terminal) FLAG-H4 construct was obtained by PCR using N-FLAG H4/pET3a plasmid as the template (N-FLAG H4/pET3a was a gift from Drs. Christophe Thiriet and Jeffrey J. Hayes), PCR Master Mix (Promega), and the following primers: forward primer, 5′-CCCGGGGATATAGCCATGGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAGCCGGATCCTTAACCACCGAAACCGTAC-3′. The forward primer introduced a XmaI restriction site (underlined) and a Kozak sequence (boldface type); the reverse primer introduced a BamHI restriction site (underlined). Purified PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and then excised using XmaI and BamHI. The enzyme digestion products were purified and ligated into pIRES-hrGFPII (Stratagene), which had been cut using XmaI and BamHI. The constructed plasmid was amplified following transformation into Escherichia coli strain JM109, confirmed by sequencing, and purified using the EndoFree plasmid kit (Qiagen). Transfection of 293-H Cells—293-H cells were obtained from Invitrogen and maintained according to the supplier's instructions. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection; stable cell lines were obtained by G418 selection after transfection with N-FLAG-H4/pIRES-hrGFPII. Green fluorescence was observed ∼30 h after transfection. Stable cell lines were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 400 μg/ml G418. FLAG-H4 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and immunoblotting as described previously (45Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar); at least 95% of the stably transfected cells expressed the FLAG epitope. FLAG-H4 represented <10% of total H4 in the transfected cells, as determined by Western analysis using antibodies recognizing unmodified H4 (the generous gift of Dr. Judith Berman; see Fig. 8). Nuclear Isolation, Histone, and Chromatin Preparation—Isolated nuclei, S100 cytosolic extracts, and acid-soluble nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); for immunoprecipitation studies, acid-extracted histones were dialyzed overnight in 1 liter of distilled water at 4 °C. Under these experimental conditions, H3 and H4 can associate and co-immunoprecipitate; however, the formation of H3/H4 complexes is less efficient than that observed using salt-extracted histones (46Isenberg I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 159-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of chromatin-bound radiolabeled histones, soluble chromatin was prepared with micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) at 5 units/ml at 4 °C, in 10 mm PIPES, 20 mm sodium butyrate, and 80 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0 (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate mononucleosomes, nuclei were isolated in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6 (43Seale R.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2847-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)), resuspended in Buffer A at 40 A260/ml, adjusted to 0.5 mm CaCl2, and digested with 1.2 units/ml micrococcal nuclease for 1.5-2.0 min at 37 °C; the reaction was stopped by adding EGTA to a final concentration of 5 mm. Digested nuclei were incubated on ice for 15-30 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at ∼10,000 × g; the supernatant, containing mononucleosomes, was termed S1 (47Annunziato A.T. Schindler R.K. Riggs M.G. Seale R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8507-8515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, incubated on ice for 20 min, and again centrifuged; this supernatant, containing mono- and polynucleosomes, was designated S2. The residual pellet was designated P (see supplemental Fig. S1) (47Annunziato A.T. Schindler R.K. Riggs M.G. Seale R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8507-8515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was measured as described previously, using a biodegradable fluor (Ecoscint A; National Diagnostics) (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Perry C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13615-13623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—In this study, several different antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation experiments. For immunoprecipitations of newly replicated and newly assembled chromatin, acetylated H4-specific antibodies (generated using a peptide representing the H4 N-terminal domain acetylated at lysines 5 and 12; i.e. the sites acetylated in newly synthesized HeLa H4) were routinely used; these antibodies have been described previously (38Chang L.

Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). During the course of our experiments, it was necessary to produce additional antibodies to the same Lys5/Lys12-acetylated H4 peptide. These antibodies (identified in the figure legends) have a minor reaction with denatured acetylated H2A in Western blots (supplemental Fig. S2A); however, they do not immunoprecipitate either acetylated (cytosolic) or newly synthesized H2A (data not presented; also see Fig. 6). Antibodies were also produced using an H4 N-terminal peptide acetylated at lysines 8 and 16, which recognize acetylated H4 primarily at lysine 8 (supplemental Fig. S2B). All other antibodies were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described, with the exception that high salt wash buffer contained 400 mm NaCl (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All immunoprecipitations used 50-100 μl of antiserum or antibody, and 40-80 μl of packed Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Antibody/chromatin excess was monitored by sequential immunoprecipitations of the unbound fraction or by doubling the amount of antibody used, as described previously (44Perry C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13615-13623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations of extracted histones, Protein A-Sepharose beads were blocked with 1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Promega) and 0.1 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma). For the analysis of immunoprecipitated histones by gel electrophoresis, washes contained 0.1% SDS; this did not affect the immunoprecipitation of intact newly assembled nucleosomes (see Fig. 4). In preparation for electrophoresis, soluble chromatin in the unbound fraction was adjusted to 10 mm MgCl2 and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol; free histones were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid (12Annunziato A.T. Seale R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12675-12684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To separate immunoprecipitated histones in gels containing SDS, immunopellets were resuspended in sample buffer and placed in boiling water for 5 min. To resolve immunoprecipitated histones in Triton-acid-urea gels, proteins were extracted from the immunopellets using the method of Crane-Robinson et al. (49Crane-Robinson C. Myers F.A. Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Wassarman P.M. Wolffe A.P. Methods in Enzymology. 304. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 533-547Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic S100 extracts from 293-H cells were prepared as described previously (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); S1 chromatin fractions were prepared as described above for HeLa cells. Prior to immunoprecipitation, ∼20% of each sample was saved as an “input” fraction. For immunoprecipitation, samples were adjusted to 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.6 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 μg/ml mycrocystin and then incubated with EZview™ Red Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. As a control, an equivalent volume of sample was incubated with mouse IgG-agarose affinity gel (Sigma). Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight. Bound and unbound fractions were separated by centrifugation for 2 min at 1200 × g. Input and unbound S100 fractions were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and dried; input and unbound S1 chromatin fractions were adjusted to 10 mm MgCl2 and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. Bound, immunoprecipitated fractions were washed five times with high salt wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.4 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, S100 preparations from HeLa or 293-H cells were treated with 5-10 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, to remove any possible contaminating chromatin. Gel Electrophoresis, Fluorography, and Immunoblotting—Radiolabeled DNA was separated in 4% polyacrylamide gels prior to analysis by fluorography (50Annunziato A.T. Schindler R.K. Thomas Jr., C.A. Seale R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11880-11886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 18% polyacrylamide gels (51Thomas J.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (40Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4275-4291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve histone H3 variants, acid-soluble proteins were separated in 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.9 m acetic acid, 6 m urea, 15% polyacrylamide (TAU) gels (52Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 53Ryan C.A. Annunziato A.T. Curr. Protocols Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 1-10Google Scholar). Fluorography was performed according to published methods (54Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). For quantitation, films were scanned using a Bio-Rad GS-800 densitometer; the intensity of the bands was determined using Quantity One software. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane according to the methods of Towbin et al. (56Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed as previously described (36Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 19"

https://openalex.org/W2071288324,"Common fragile sites (CFSs) are large genomic regions present in all individuals that are highly unstable and prone to breakage and rearrangement, especially in cancer cells with genomic instability. Eight of the 90 known CFSs have been precisely defined and five of these span genes that extend from 700 kb to over 1.5 Mb of genomic sequence. Although these genes reside within some of the most unstable chromosomal regions in the human genome, they are highly conserved evolutionarily. These genes are targets for large chromosomal deletions and rearrangements in cancer and are frequently inactivated in multiple tumor types. There is also an association between these genes and cellular responses to stress. Based upon the association between large genes and CFSs, we began to systematically test other large genes derived from chromosomal regions that were known to contain a CFS. In this study, we demonstrate that the 730 kb retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) gene is derived from the middle of the FRA15A (15q22.2) CFS. Although this gene is expressed in normal breast, prostate and ovarian epithelium, it is frequently inactivated in cancers that arise from these organs. RORA was previously shown to be involved in the cellular response to hypoxia and here we demonstrate changes in the amount of RORA message produced in cells exposed to a variety of different cellular stresses. Our results demonstrate that RORA is another very large CFS gene that is inactivated in multiple tumors. In addition, RORA appears to play a critical role in responses to cellular stress, lending further support to the idea that the large CFS genes function as part of a highly conserved stress response network that is uniquely susceptible to genomic instability in cancer cells."

Recently O-fucose on EGF repeats was shown to play important roles in Notch signaling. In contrast, physiological roles for O-fucose on TSRs are unknown. In the accompanying paper (Luo, Y., Nita-Lazar, A., and Haltiwanger, R. S. (2006) J. Biol.

A known homologue of O-fucosyltransferase 1 is putative protein O-fucosyltransferase 2. The cDNA sequence encoding O-fucosyltransferase 2 was originally identified during a data base search for fucosyltransferases in Drosophila. Like O-fucosyltransferase 1, O-fucosyltransferase 2 is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. Although O-fucosyltransferase 2 was assumed to be another protein O-fucosyltransferase, no biochemical characterization existed supporting this contention. Here we show that RNAi-mediated reduction of the O-fucosyltransferase 2 message significantly decreased TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase activity in Drosophila S2 cells. We also found that O-fucosyltransferase 2 is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment of these cells. Furthermore, we expressed recombinant Drosophila O-fucosyltransferase 2 and showed that it O-fucosylates TSRs but not EGF repeats in vitro.

Fucose is typically found as a terminal modification in glycoconjugates where it plays a number of important biological roles. Fucose is a component of the A, B, O blood group antigens, as well as the Sialyl Lewis x epitope essential for selectin-mediated extravasation of leukocytes (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that ablation of FUT8, the enzyme responsible for addition of core α1,6-linked fucose to N-glycans, results in severe growth retardation and early postnatal death in mice, apparently because of alterations in a number of signaling pathways including those initiated by transforming growth factor β1 and epidermal growth factor (2Wang X.

The enzyme responsible for adding O-fucose to EGF repeats has been identified as protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1 in humans and OFUT1 in Drosophila) (7Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J.

To begin investigating the biological implications of TSR O-fucosylation, we have initiated studies on the enzymes responsible for addition of O-fucose glycans to TSR. In the accompanying article (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that POFUT1 is not capable of adding O-fucose to TSR. This finding led us to propose the presence of a novel TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase. Using the assay we developed for this enzyme, we showed that TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase is similar to POFUT1 in several respects. Both enzymes utilize GDP-fucose as donor substrate and require properly folded acceptor substrates (either EGF repeats or TSRs) for activity (11Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, modification of both EGF repeats and TSRs appears to be conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates (5Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we reasoned that the TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase might be a homologue of POFUT1 conserved in invertebrates and vertebrates. All fucosyltransferases identified or predicted to date can be divided into four groups according to their preference for acceptor substrates: α1,2-fucosyltransferases, α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases, α1,6-fucosyltransferases, and protein O-fucosyltransferases (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 13Martinez-Duncker I. Mollicone R. Candelier J.J. Breton C. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1C-5CCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The protein O-fucosyltransferase group includes POFUT1 and a closely homologous gene family, POFUT2 (abbreviated Ofut2 in Drosophila), which was originally identified in a data base search for genes involved in fucose metabolism in Drosophila (14Roos C. Kolmer M. Mattila P. Renkonen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3168-3175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In that study, only human and Drosophila genes (POFUT2 and Ofut2, respectively) were identified. In a subsequent study, POFUT2 orthologs were found in many other metazoan species (13Martinez-Duncker I. Mollicone R. Candelier J.J. Breton C. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1C-5CCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although O-fucosyltransferase 2 is assumed to be an O-fucosyltransferase based on sequence similarity, no biochemical demonstration of activity has been reported for this protein family. Here we characterized the biochemical activity of Drosophila OFUT2. We show that OFUT2 is a predominantly ER-localized enzyme that possesses TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase activity.

The resulting DNA was inserted into pMT/BiP/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the BiP signal sequence (16Kirkpatrick R.B. Ganguly S. Angelichio M. Griego S. Shatzman A. Silverman C. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19800-19805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using BglII and AgeI restriction sites. The final construct encoded a Drosophila OFUT2 fusion protein in which the first 62 amino acids, including the endogenous signal peptide and part of the N-terminal region, were replaced with BiP signal peptide followed by the IgG-binding domain of S. aureus protein A. A construct for the expression of HA-tagged full-length Drosophila OFUT2 protein was prepared by: (i) introducing an SpeI site immediately after the last codon of the Ofut2 open reading frame by PCR; (ii) in-frame ligation of double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the HA-His6 tag and a stop codon (17Koles K. Irvine K.D. Panin V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4346-4357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); and (iii) subcloning the resulting DNA construct into the pRmHA-3 expression vector (18Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Protein Expression—Drosophila S2 cells were maintained and transfected with the Drosophila Ofut2 expression construct as described (19Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For purification of protein A-tagged OFUT2 protein, we collected medium from transfected S2 cells 24 h after the induction of protein expression with 0.7 mm CuSO4. The collected medium was incubated with IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. Afterward, the beads were extensively washed with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (Complete mixture, Roche) and analyzed by Western blotting and O-fucosyltransferase assays. RNAi-mediated Silencing of Ofut1 and Ofut2 in Drosophila S2 Cells—For RNAi experiments, the dsRNA corresponding to the coding region of a specific gene was synthesized using the MEGAscript RNAi kit (Ambion). As templates for dsRNA synthesis, we used ∼700-bp DNA fragments of Drosophila Ofut2, Ofut1, and CG9220 cDNAs produced by PCR and the following primer pairs that included a T7 RNA polymerase-binding site (designated as {T7}): Ofut2,5′-{T7}CGCCGTGTATATCCTTTACGA-3′ and 5′-{T7}GAAGCATCTGTGGTGTCCAG-3′; CG9220, 5′-{T7}CCAGGCACATGTTGTACTGC-3′ and 5′-{T7}GACCTCCTGGTGGTGATCTTC-3′; Ofut1, 5′-{T7}aggaataccatcgcgtcatc-3′ and 5′-{T7 }cgactaagggccgtgtttag-3′; where {T7} is GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA. The CG9220 gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase of the β3GT superfamily (see Flybase and Ref. 20Correia T. Papayannopoulos V. Panin V. Woronoff P. Jiang J. Vogt T.F. Irvine K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6404-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used as an irrelevant gene control. Drosophila Ofut1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Kenneth Irvine (Rutgers). The primers were designed using the E-RNAi program (21Arziman Z. Horn T. Boutros M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W582-W588Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Annealing, nuclease treatment, and purification of dsRNA was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). Drosophila S2 cells were treated with dsRNA as described in Ref. 22Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar with the following modifications. Culture cells were plated onto a 60-mm culture dish in 6 ml of complete M3 medium (Shield and Sang M3 medium (Sigma) with 5 g/liter of yeast extract, 12.5 g/liter of Bacto-peptone, 12.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Fungizone) at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After cells attached to the dishes, the complete medium was replaced with 2 ml of serum-free M3 medium without antibiotics and 60 μg of dsRNA was added to the dish, except for the mock control. As a control, a separate dish of cells was prepared following the same procedures but without addition of dsRNA. The cells were incubated with dsRNA for 6 h followed by replacing the media with 6 ml of complete fetal bovine serum-containing M3 media. Two days after dsRNA transfection, the cells were diluted with 9 ml of complete medium, transferred to 10-cm plates, and then let grow for another day. The cell numbers were counted 3 days after transfection and the cells were harvested immediately by low-speed centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min). The cell pellet was washed 2 times with TBS and kept frozen on dry ice until in vitro assays. Immunolocalization Experiments—Drosophila S2 cells were transfected or co-transfected with plasmids using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation protocol (23Cherbas L. Moss R. Cherbas P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As a marker for the ER subcellular compartment, we used a GFP:KDEL construct (24Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of OFUT2-expressing S2 cells was performed as described earlier (25Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies and corresponding dilutions were used for immunostaining: rabbit anti-LVA (1:3,000) (a gift from John Sisson, University of Texas, Austin, TX) (26Sisson J.C. Field C. Ventura R. Royou A. Sullivan W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and rat anti-HA (1:2,000) (Roche). We used the following fluorescent secondary goat antibodies: anti-rat Alexa 488 (1:150) and anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (1:100) (highly cross-absorbed antibodies from Molecular Probes). Digital images were obtained using Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope with the Apo-Tome module for optical sectioning. Other Methods—The method for making extracts of S2 cells was described previously (27Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). O-Fucosyltransferase assays were performed as described in the accompanying article (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis of O-Fucosyltransferase 2—Roos and co-workers (14Roos C. Kolmer M. Mattila P. Renkonen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3168-3175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were the first to identify OFUT2 as a Drosophila protein with weak sequence similarity to OFUT1. They also reported an orthologue in humans (POFUT2). A more detailed sequence analysis revealed the presence of three conserved peptide motifs in all fucosyltransferases, including O-fucosyltransferase 2 (13Martinez-Duncker I. Mollicone R. Candelier J.J. Breton C. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1C-5CCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This report also identified O-fucosyltransferase 2 orthologues in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, including human, mouse, chicken, frog, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Fig. 1 shows a Clustal W sequence alignment of the O-fucosyltransferase 2 orthologues from human, mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans. The three conserved peptide motifs identified previously are shown. Several features of the sequences were revealed upon analysis using online sequence analysis tools, SMART and SOSUI. All O-fucosyltransferase 2 sequences have an N-terminal signal sequence with no internal transmembrane sequences (Fig. 1), indicating that O-fucosyltransferase 2 is probably a soluble protein like POFUT1. The Clustal W alignment also reveals four cysteines conserved in all four O-fucosyltransferase 2 sequences and three potential N-glycosylation sites conserved in the human and mouse enzymes (Fig. 1). A conserved DXD-like motif (ERE in human, mouse, and Drosophila homologues; DRE in C. elegans homologue) is found near the C terminus (Fig. 1). Frequently seen in many classes of glycosyltransferases including POFUT1, the DXD-like motif is believed to be critical for the proper function of these enzymes (28Munro S. Freeman M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), although in this case it does not appear to function in metal binding (see Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Analysis of divalent metal ion requirement and substrate dependence of recombinant Drosophila OFUT2. A, activity of Drosophila OFUT2 without any added metal or in the presence of 10 mm EDTA or 10 mm MnCl2. Assays were carried out as described (43Dlugosz M.A. Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1219aGoogle Scholar). Dependence of recombinant Drosophila OFUT2 activity on GDP-fucose concentration (B) and human TSP1-TSR3 concentration (C) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNAi Knockdown of Ofut2 Reduces TSR O-Fucosyltransferase Activity in S2 Cells—As an initial step to evaluate whether OFUT2 is the TSR O-fucosyltransferase, we used RNAi to knock-down endogenous expression of Ofut2 in Drosophila S2 cells. The effects of the RNAi treatment were evaluated based on the ability of extracts to fucosylate EGF repeats (OFUT1 activity) or TSRs. TSR O-fucosyltransferase activity (using TSP1-TSR3 as substrate, see accompanying paper (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) was reduced by ∼90% in cells transfected with the Ofut2 dsRNA compared with S2 cells transfected with an irrelevant control dsRNA (CG9220) and mock transfected S2 cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, OFUT1 activity (using factor VII EGF repeat as substrate) was unaffected compared with the irrelevant control. As a control, we also knocked down Ofut1 expression in S2 cells (Fig. 2B). As expected, OFUT1 activity was nearly completely abolished, whereas OFUT2 activity was not affected. These results indicate that OFUT2 is the major TSR O-fucosyltransferase in these cells, and that OFUT1 and OFUT2 catalyze the O-fucosylation of EGF repeats and TSRs, respectively, in a non-redundant manner. Recombinant Drosophila OFUT2 Has TSR O-Fucosyltransferase Activity—To provide further evidence that OFUT2 is a TSR O-fucosyltransferase, we expressed a portion of the predicted luminal domain of Drosophila OFUT2 in S2 cells. The partial cDNA encoding amino acids 63–490 (lacking the endogenous signal sequence and a stretch of residues not conserved in other OFUT2 homologues, Fig. 1) of Drosophila OFUT2 was cloned into an insect cell expression plasmid in-frame with sequences encoding an N-terminal signal peptide and protein A IgG binding domain (Fig. 3A). S2 cells were transiently transfected with the Ofut2 expression plasmid (or a control empty plasmid), and the fusion protein was isolated from the medium using IgG-Sepharose. O-Fucosyltransferase assays were performed using the protein captured on the IgG-Sepharose with either TSP1-TSR3 (for TSR O-fucosyltransferase activity) or factor VII EGF repeat (for OFUT1 activity) as acceptor substrates. TSR O-fucosyltransferase was found only in samples from cells transfected with the Ofut2 expression plasmid (Fig. 3B). No activity was detected when an EGF repeat was used as acceptor substrate (OFUT1 activity), consistent with the acceptor specificity of the TSR O-fucosyltransferase (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the TSR O-fucosyltransferase activity is not in OFUT2 but in a different protein that merely associates with or co-purifies with the OFUT2 fusion protein, we generated a mutant form of Drosophila OFUT2 in the putative “DXD” motif (Fig. 1). Glutamates 442 and 443 were altered to alanines (E442A/E443A) through site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant Drosophila OFUT2 was expressed and assayed for TSR O-fucosyltransferase activity. The mutation reduced activity to background levels, indicating that OFUT2 catalyzes the reaction (Fig. 3C). Expression of the wild type and mutant forms of OFUT2 were confirmed by immunoblot analysis with protein A-binding antibody (Fig. 3C, inset). Comparable amounts of a protein species of ∼60 kDa (consistent with the predicted size of the OFUT2 fusion protein: 59 kDa) were seen from the S2 cells transfected with either Ofut2 expression plasmid (wild type or mutant). Efficient secretion of mutant OFUT2 protein into cell medium suggests proper folding of the protein, which nevertheless, was inactive. In combination with the RNAi data shown in Fig. 2, these results strongly indicate that OFUT2 is a Drosophila form of the TSR O-fucosyltransferase described in the accompanying paper (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To confirm that the product of the Drosophila OFUT2 reaction is O-fucosylated TSR, we performed product analysis. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis showed that the radiolabeled assay product co-migrates with TSP1-TSR3, demonstrating that the [3H]fucose is covalently associated with TSP1-TSR3 (Fig. 4A). The [3H]fucose was then released from TSP1-TSR3 by alkali-induced β-elimination in the presence of sodium borohydride. Gel filtration and high-pH anion exchange chromatography analysis showed that the released sugar is the monosaccharide fucitol, demonstrating that the [3H]fucose was directly attached to TSP1-TSR3 in O-linkage (Fig. 4, B and C). These results demonstrate that Drosophila OFUT2 modifies TSP1-TSR3 with O-fucose. Initial Characterization of Recombinant Drosophila OFUT2—The recombinant Drosophila OFUT2 proved to be fairly heat-labile, so all assays were performed at room temperature (data not shown). In contrast to POFUT1 (7Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40338-40345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Drosophila OFUT2 activity was not enhanced by Mn2+, nor impaired by EDTA (Fig. 5A). Several other divalent ions were also tested without effect (data not shown), suggesting that Drosophila OFUT2 does not require divalent metal ions for proper function. The dependence of activity on the concentration of GDP-fucose and TSP1-TSR3 was also examined (Fig. 5, B and C). Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data revealed that the Km for TSP1-TSR3 is ∼2.5 μm, whereas that for GDP-fucose is ∼4.5 μm, comparable with the values obtained for EGF repeats (6 μm) and GDP-fucose (4 μm), respectively, for POFUT1 (7Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40338-40345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Full-length Drosophila OFUT2 Localizes to the ER in S2 Cells—Initial analysis of subcellular localization was performed by immunolocalization of full-length Drosophila OFUT2 bearing a C-terminal HA tag (OFUT2-HA). The functionality of the OFUT2-HA protein was confirmed by in vitro assays of Drosophila S2 cells transfected with the OFUT2-HA-expressing construct or mock transfected with an empty vector. Assays of lysates from S2 cells expressing OFUT2-HA showed significantly increased OFUT2 activity using TSP1-TSR3 as an acceptor substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”), indicating that the full-length construct encodes a functional enzyme (Fig. 6A). Immunolocalization of OFUT2-HA showed significant co-localization with KDEL: GFP, an ER marker (24Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, E–G), and a minimal co-localization with LVA, a Golgi marker (26Sisson J.C. Field C. Ventura R. Royou A. Sullivan W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, B–D). These results suggest that OFUT2-HA localizes mainly to the ER, although a small amount appears to be in the Golgi. POFUT1 and POFUT2 are two homologous gene families found in a variety of metazoan species that encode POFUT1 and POFUT2, respectively (13Martinez-Duncker I. Mollicone R. Candelier J.J. Breton C. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1C-5CCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). POFUT1 is a well characterized enzyme known to add O-fucose to EGF repeats (7Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40338-40345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Reduction or elimination of POFUT1 expression (or its homologues) abrogates Notch function in both Drosophila and mice, demonstrating the crucial role it plays in biology. In contrast, POFUT2 was predicted to be an O-fucosyltransferase based on its sequence similarity with POFUT1, although no biochemical evidence showing activity had been reported. In the accompanying paper (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that an O-fucosyltransferase activity distinct from POFUT1 exists in cells capable of adding O-fucose to TSRs. Here we provide biochemical evidence that Drosophila OFUT2 is a TSR O-fucosyltransferase. Identification of OFUT2 as a TSR O-fucosyltransferase provides a major tool for evaluation of the physiological function of TSR fucosylation. A recent study of the O-fucosyltransferase 2 homologue in C. elegans provided the first evidence that O-fucosyltransferase 2 may be involved in development (29Menzel O. Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Reymond A. Mueller F. Antonarakis S.E. Guipponi M. Genomics. 2004; 84: 320-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This study showed that reduction of C. elegans O-fucosyltransferase 2 by RNAi causes failure of embryos to undergo normal morphogenesis, although this effect was of low penetrance. In contrast, overexpression of O-fucosyltransferase 2 resulted in severe body malformation and abnormal neuronal development in up to 83% of the embryos. To date functional roles of O-fucosyltransferase 2 in Drosophila and mammals remain unknown. Whereas enzymatic activity has not yet been reported for the C. elegans homologue of OFUT2, we have obtained preliminary data showing that mouse POFUT2 is a TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase (43Dlugosz M.A. Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1219aGoogle Scholar). The fact that O-fucose modification of EGF repeats plays an important role in the physical interaction between Notch and its ligands suggests that O-fucose on TSRs may function similarly (30Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Like EGF repeats, TSRs are well known to mediate protein-protein interactions (31Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similarly, elongation of O-fucose on TSRs to the disaccharide, Glc-β1,3-fucose, could modulate these interactions in much the same way that elongation of O-fucose glycans on EGF repeats by Fringe modulates interactions between Notch and its ligands (12Haltiwanger R.S. Lowe J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 32Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition to direct effects on protein-protein interactions, O-fucose modifications have recently been implicated in protein folding and quality control. Both Drosophila OFUT1 and mammalian POFUT1 are localized in the ER (24Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The fact that POFUT1 has the ability to distinguish between properly folded and unfolded EGF repeats (11Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggests that it could play a role in quality control. In addition, a recent study reported that Drosophila OFUT1 has a chaperone-like activity promoting Notch receptor folding and trafficking from the ER to the cell surface (24Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The fact that POFUT2 only modifies properly folded TSRs (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that Drosophila OFUT2-HA is mainly localized to the ER (Fig. 6) suggests that POFUT2 may also function in quality control. Further support for ER localization of POFUT2 enzymes comes from the fact that O-fucosylation of TSRs is unaffected in fibroblasts from patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II/congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIc (LADII/CDGIIc). LADII/CDGIIc is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by leukocyte adhesion deficiency as well as severe neurological and developmental abnormalities (34Etzioni A. Frydman M. Pollack S. Avidor I. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Gershoni-Baruch R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1789-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). It is caused by mutations in the Golgi GDP-fucose transporter, resulting in a reduction of fucosylated antigens on the cell surface (35Sturla L. Puglielli L. Tonetti M. Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. De Flora A. Etzioni A. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Etzioni A. Sturla L. Antonellis A. Green E.D. Gershoni-Baruch R. Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Tonetti M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 110: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Lubke T. Marquardt T. von Figura K. Korner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25986-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 38Lubke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Korner C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Analysis of fibroblasts from LADII/CDGIIc patients revealed that terminal fucose modifications on N-glycans are significantly reduced. Surprisingly, O-fucosylation of EGF repeats and TSRs is not affected in cells from these patients (39Sturla L. Rampal R. Haltiwanger R.S. Fruscione F. Etzioni A. Tonetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 40Sturla L. Fruscione F. Noda K. Miyoshi E. Taniguchi N. Contini P. Tonetti M. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Specifically, the major form of O-fucose saccharide on TSRs, Glc-β1,3-fucitol, is unaffected in fibroblasts from LADII/CDGIIc patients. The localization of POFUT1 and -2 to the ER provides a potential explanation for these results. A separate GDP-fucose transport mechanism, unaffected by the mutations found in the LADII cells, may provide GDP-fucose to the ER, allowing O-fucosylation of EGF repeats and TSRs. Support for such a mechanism has been recently provided by a GDP-fucose transporter study in Drosophila (41Ishikawa H.O. Higashi S. Ayukawa T. Sasamura T. Kitagawa M. Harigaya K. Aoki K. Ishida N. Sanai Y. Matsuno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18532-18537Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Examination of the N-terminal sequences from human, mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans O-fucosyltransferase 2 using online sequence analysis programs suggests that POFUT2 enzymes are soluble proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 1). This is consistent with our observation that the majority of TSR O-fucosyltransferase activity is present in high-speed supernatants of COS1 cells (42Luo Y. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9385-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the C-terminal KDEL-like motif RDEF of mammalian POFUT1 is responsible for retaining the protein in the ER (33Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas the analogous HEEL motif was found to be involved in ER localization of the Drosophila counterpart protein (24Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, these motifs are absent from O-fucosyltransferase 2 protein sequences (Fig. 1), suggesting that an alternate ER retention signal or mechanism exists for O-fucosyltransferase 2. Interestingly, tagged forms of C21orf80 (one potential splice form of human POFUT2) expressed in COS-7 or U2OS cells were found in the Golgi compartment (29Menzel O. Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Reymond A. Mueller F. Antonarakis S.E. Guipponi M. Genomics. 2004; 84: 320-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, functionality of the fusion constructs used in this report remains unknown. Studies to confirm the subcellular localization of POFUT2 in mammalian cells are in progress. We thank Dr. Pamela Stanley (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) for helpful discussions, and members of the Haltiwanger laboratory for critically reading the manuscript. We thank Dr. John Sisson for anti-LVA antibody and Dr. Kenneth Irvine for Ofut1 cDNA and the GFP:KDEL construct."
https://openalex.org/W2078222310,"Trp53 is arguably the most critical tumour suppressor gene product that inhibits malignant transformation. Besides mutations that inactivate Trp53 functions, genetic polymorphisms have been suggested to be risk factors for cancer. A polymorphic site at codon 72 in exon 4 encodes either an arginine amino acid (Trp5372R) or a proline residue (Trp5372P). Previous studies have shown that the Trp5372R form is more efficient in apoptosis induction, whereas the Trp5372P form was suggested to induce G1 arrest better. Here we report that Trp5372P is more efficient than Trp5372R in specifically activating several Trp53-dependent DNA-repair target genes in several cellular systems. Moreover, using isogenic cell lines and several DNA-repair assays, we show that Trp5372P cells have a significantly higher DNA-repair capacity than the Trp5372R cells. Furthermore, Trp5372P-expressing cells exhibit reduced micronuclei formation compared to Trp5372R-expressing cells, suggesting that genomic instability is reduced in these cells. Together, the data highlight the functional differences between the Trp53 polymorphic variants, and suggest that their expression status may influence cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2041514890,"Human differentially expressed in chondrocytes (DEC), mouse stimulated with retinoic acid and rat split and hairy related proteins constitute a structurally distinct class of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins. DEC1 is abundantly expressed in tumors and protects against apoptosis induced by serum starvation. In this study, we report that DEC1 antiapoptosis is achieved by inducing survivin, an antiapoptotic protein. In paired tumor–normal tissues, survivin and DEC1 exhibited a paralleled expression pattern. Tetracycline-induced expression of DEC1 in stable lines proportionally increased the expression of survivin. In reporter assays, DEC1 transactivated the survivin promoter but repressed the DEC2 promoter. In contrast to the repression, the activation was delayed and varied depending on serum concentrations and cycle blockers. Studies with reporter mutants located, in the survivin promoter, two Sp1 sites that supported DEC1 transactivation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation detected the presence of DEC1 in the survivin promoter. These findings establish that the survivin gene is a transcription target of DEC1, and induction of survivin is at least in part responsible for DEC1 antiapoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2001869838,"Epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats and thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) are both small cysteine-knot motifs known to be O-fucosylated. The enzyme responsible for the addition of O-fucose to EGF repeats, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), has been identified and shown to be essential in Notch signaling. Fringe, an O-fucose β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, elongates O-fucose on specific EGF repeats from Notch to form a disaccharide that can be further elongated to a tetrasaccharide. TSRs are found in many extracellular matrix proteins and are involved in protein-protein interactions. The O-fucose moiety on TSRs can be further elongated with glucose to form a disaccharide. The discovery of O-fucose on TSRs raised the question of whether POFUT1, or a different enzyme, adds O-fucose to TSRs. Here we demonstrate the existence of a TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase distinct from POFUT1. Similar to POFUT1, the novel TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase is a soluble enzyme that requires a properly folded TSR as an acceptor substrate. In addition, we found that a previously identified fucose-specific β1,3-glucosyltransferase adds glucose to O-fucose on TSRs, but it does not modify O-fucose on an EGF repeat. Similarly, Lunatic fringe, Manic fringe, and Radical fringe are all capable of modifying O-fucose on an EGF repeat, but not on a TSR. Taken together, these results suggest that two distinct O-fucosylation pathways exist in cells, one specific for EGF repeat and the other for TSRs.

O-Fucose is an unusual form of glycosylation in which a fucose is covalently attached to the hydroxyl group (O-linkage) of a serine or threonine residue. It was originally found in amino acid fucosides isolated from human urine (1Hallgren P. Lundblad A. Svensson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5312-5314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Based on the presence of two different forms of elongated O-fucose, we had originally proposed that the O-fucose glycosylation pathway was branched, and that the enzymes modifying O-fucose, the fucose-specific β1,3-glucosyltransferase and the fucose-specific β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, would compete with the one another (9Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). More recently, a significant role for O-fucosylation of EGF repeats within the Notch receptor protein has been revealed (10Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Fringe, a known modulator of Notch signaling, is a fucose-specific β1,3-N-acetylcosaminyltransferase, capable of elongating O-fucose on Notch (12Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L.

Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (abbreviated POFUT1 for humans, OFUT1 for Drosophila) is responsible for adding O-fucose to EGF repeats (14Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol.

Furthermore, ablation of the mouse Pofut1 gene causes an embryonic lethal phenotype similar to Notch1 deficiency (18Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reduction of O-fucosylation on Notch through down-regulation of Ofut1 significantly reduces the binding between Notch and its ligands, suggesting that O-fucosylation plays an important role in Notch-ligand interactions (20Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recent results also suggest that Drosophila OFUT1 can function as a chaperone and play an important role in proper folding and cell surface expression of Notch (21Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that O-fucosyltransferase 1 and O-fucose modifications of EGF repeats play essential roles in Notch function. In addition to EGF repeats, Hofsteenge and co-workers (22Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol.

Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have shown that O-fucose occurs in a totally different protein context: thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). TSRs are small cysteine-knot modules of ∼60 amino acids in length containing six conserved Cys residues, as well as conserved Trp, Ser, and Arg residues (24Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Like EGF repeats, the cysteines of TSRs participate in disulfide bonds stabilizing the whole structure, although their disulfide bonding patterns are distinct (24Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Hofsteenge and co-workers (22Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol.

By comparing sequence contexts surrounding the modified residues, a consensus sequence was proposed: WX5C1X2-3S/TC2X2G. They also showed that O-fucose on TSRs could be further elongated by glucose to form a Glc-Fuc disaccharide, although the linkage between fucose and glucose was not determined. This suggested that the previously described Glc-β1,3-Fuc disaccharide may occur on TSRs instead of EGF repeats (9Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The presence of O-fucose on TSRs raised the question of whether POFUT1 or a novel enzyme is responsible for adding O-fucose to TSRs. Because TSRs are also cysteine-knot motifs, it is plausible that POFUT1 could fucosylate both EGF repeats and TSRs. Here we examine whether POFUT1 modifies both EGF repeats and TSRs or whether a unique enzyme exists for fucosylation of TSRs. In addition, we examine whether the glucose-fucose disaccharide seen by Hofsteenge and co-workers (22Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol.

Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, we investigate whether there is cross-talk between elongation of O-fucose on EGF repeats and TSRs by testing if any of the fringe enzymes modify O-fucose on TSR repeats or if the fucose-specific β1,3-glucosyltransferase modifies O-fucose on EGF repeats. Materials—GDP-β-l-Fucose was purchased from Oxford GlycoSystems. l-[6-3H]Fucose (60 Ci/mmol) and GDP-[1-3H(N)]fucose (17.3 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).

Plasmid Construction—Constructs for expressing the third TSR from human thrombospondin-1 (TSP1-TSR3) in mammalian cells (pSecTag-hTSP1-TSR3) and Escherichia coli (pET20b+-hTSP1-TSR3) were prepared as follows. DNA sequences encoding TSP1-TSR3 (amino acids 472-530) were amplified using primers containing HindIII and XhoI sites (5′-TCGCTAAAGCTTCCATCAATGGAGGCT-3′ and 5′-TCGACGATCTCGAGGAATTGGACAGTCCTG-3′, for pSecTag-hTSP1-TSR3) or primers containing BamHI and XhoI sites (5′-ACCGAAGGATCCCATCAATGGAGGCTGGGG-3′ and 5′-TGAAATCTCGAGAATTGGACAGTCCTGCTTGTTGC-3′, for pET20b+-hTSP1-TSR3). A plasmid encoding the three TSRs of human TSP1 (kindly provided by Dr. Deane Mosher, University of Wisconsin) was used as template. The amplified fragments were then subcloned into pSecTag2C vector in-frame with a C-terminal Myc and His6 coding sequence using HindIII and XhoI sites or pET20b+ vector in-frame with a C-terminal His6 coding sequence using BamHI and XhoI sites. To mutate the O-fucose site in both constructs, threonine 489 was changed to Ala (T489A) using the Stratagene QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Protocol, with primers 5′-CATCTGTTCTGTCGCCTGTGGAGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTCCTCCACAGGCGACAGAACAGATG-3′. All constructs were sequenced prior to further study. Analysis of O-Fucose Saccharide Structure on the Third TSR of Human Thrombospondin 1—The plasmid encoding wild type or the T489A mutant of TSP1-TSR3 (pSecTag-hTSP1-TSR3) was transiently transfected into Lec1-CHO cells using Geneporter (Gene Therapy Systems) essentially as described previously (12Moloney D.J.

Production of Recombinant Human TSP1-TSR3 Repeat and O-Fucose Site Mutants in E. coli—TSP1-TSR3 was expressed in the BL21(DE3) E. coli strain using the pET20b+-hTSP1-TSR3 vector, and the TSP1-TSR3 protein was partially purified using Ni-NTA-agarose essentially as described previously (25Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify the properly folded TSP1-TSR3 repeat, a portion of the partially purified TSP1-TSR3 repeat was radiolabeled using detergent-containing extracts of Lec1-CHO cells (source of TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase) using O-fucosyltransferase assay conditions as described (15Wang Y.

Reverse-phase HPLC was performed to separate the properly folded TSP1-TSR3 repeats from misfolded variants following conditions described in Ref. 25Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. We have used the same conditions to purify recombinant EGF repeats in the past, and the properly folded form was identified by the presence of [3H]fucose. The remainder of the TSP1-TSR3 repeat was then purified in the same manner on a preparative scale. The final concentration of TSP1-TSR3 was determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). The TSP1-TSR3 repeats containing the T489A mutation were expressed and purified in the same manner. Reduction and alkylation of TSRs were carried out as reported previously (25Shao L. Luo Y.

The assay for TSR O-fucosyltransferase activity is essentially the same with the POFUT1 assay except that recombinant TSR instead of the EGF repeat was used as acceptor substrate. A typical assay was carried out by incubating 8 μg of recombinant TSR with 0.1 μCi of GDP-[3H]fucose, 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm MnCl2, and enzyme sources in a total volume of 50 μlat37 °Cfor 1 h. Product characterization of fucosylated TSRs from the assay was performed as described (15Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol.

Reduction of Endogenous POFUT1 by RNA Interference in HeLa Cells—A 21-nucleotide siRNA duplex with 3′-TT (sense strand) and 3′-TC (antisense strand) overhangs corresponding to the human POFUT1 mRNA-translated region (GGAUUUCAUGGAGAAGCUG) was synthesized (Ambion). A “scrambled” siRNA duplex (Ambion) was used as the RNA interference specificity control. The siRNA duplexes were transfected into HeLa cells on 35-mm dishes by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfection (48 h), the media were removed and the cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). The cells on the dishes were then lysed in Tris-buffered saline with 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation. POFUT1 activity and TSR-specific O-fucosyltransferase activity in the supernatants were then determined using the assays as described above. In Vitro Fucosylation of TSR and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—HPLC purified recombinant TSP1-TSR3 was reconstituted in water to a concentration ∼0.5 mg/ml. In vitro O-fucosylation reaction was carried out by incubating ∼0.35 mg of TSP1-TSR3 with 0.6 mm GDP-fucose, 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm MnCl2, and 0.25 mg of high speed supernatants of sonicated Lec1-CHO cells in a total volume of 1 ml at 37 °C for 12 h. The reaction was then continued for 4 more h after adding 0.12 mg of fresh Lec1-CHO lysate. Fucosylated TSRs were then re-purified using reverse-phase HPLC as described above. The extent of O-fucosylation was determined by mass spectrometry using direct infusion into an Agilent XCT ion trap mass spectrometer as described previously (29Rampal R. Li A.S. Moloney D.J.

Lec1-CHO Cells Possess an Enzymatic Activity Capable of O-Fucosylating the Third TSR of Human Thrombospondin 1—We previously described two different elongated forms of O-fucose on proteins isolated from Lec1-CHO cells: the tetrasaccharide, NeuAc-α2,3-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc-O-Ser/Thr, and the disaccharide, Glc-β1,3-Fucα1-O-Ser/Thr (9Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lec1-CHO cells are a convenient model system for the study of O-fucose glycans because they lack N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and, therefore, cannot synthesize complex or hybid-type N-glycans (34Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because most [3H]fucose becomes metabolically incorporated into complex or hybrid-type N-glycans in wild type CHO cells, Lec1-CHO cells have the advantage that the majority of [3H]fucose is metabolically incorporated into O-fucose glycans (9Moloney D.J.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At the time of our earlier studies, O-fucose was only known to exist on EGF repeats (2Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As a result, we proposed that both the di- and tetrasaccharides would modify EGF repeats. We later discovered that the tetrasaccharide exists on EGF repeats of the Notch1 protein (3Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Hofsteenge and co-workers (22Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J.

These results suggested that the Glc-β1,3-Fuc disaccharide found in Lec1-CHO cells may actually exist on TSR repeats, whereas the tetrasaccharide form of O-fucose exist on EGF repeats. To confirm this speculation, a secreted form of the third TSR of human thrombospondin 1 (TSP1-TSR3) was expressed in Lec1-CHO cells. As a control, the O-fucose site (Thr489) was abolished by site-directed mutagenesis of threonine to alanine. Wild type and mutant constructs were transiently transfected into Lec1-CHO cells, followed by metabolic radiolabeling with [3H]fucose. The secreted wild type and T489A mutants were purified from media by Ni-NTA-agarose and analyzed by Western blot and fluorography. Whereas wild type TSP1-TSR3 protein was radiolabeled with [3H]fucose, the T489A mutant was not (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the fucose was O-linked to the hydroxyl group of Thr489, the O-linked sugars were released from TSP1-TSR3 using alkali-induced β-elimination. Gel filtration analysis revealed the majority of released glycan as disaccharide, with a very small amount of monosaccharide (Fig. 1B). High-performance anion-exchange chromatography analysis showed that the disaccharide was Glc-β1,3-fucitol and the small amount of monosaccharide was fucitol (Fig. 1C). Thus, TSRs expressed in Lec1-CHO cells are modified with the Glc-β1,3-Fuc disaccharide. The fact that this disaccharide has never been detected on an EGF repeat isolated from Lec1-CHO cells (3Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol.

Development of an in Vitro Assay for O-Fucosylation on TSP1-TSR3—To develop an in vitro assay for the enzymatic activity responsible for O-fucosylating TSRs, we utilized GDP-[3H]fucose as the donor substrate and bacterially expressed recombinant TSP1-TSR3 as the acceptor substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2047632128,"In hematopoietic cells the transforming potential of the ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Evi1) oncogene is thought to be dependent upon the ability to inhibit TGFβ signaling. Although Evi1 has recently been implicated in certain epithelial cancers, the effects of Evi1 on transformation and TGFβ signaling in epithelial cells are not completely understood. Herein, we have determined the effects of Evi1 on TGFβ signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Stable expression of Evi1 in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells inhibited induction of some Smad3-dependent TGFβ target genes, such as PAI1. However, TGFβ-mediated induction of cellular adhesion signaling components such as integrin1 and paxillin was not inhibited by Evi1; nor did Evi1 inhibit TGFβ-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Likewise, Evi1 did not inhibit TGFβ-mediated downregulation of cyclin D1 or block TGFβ-mediated growth inhibition. However, Evi1 did inhibit TGFβ-mediated apoptosis by a process that involves phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector AKT. The ability of Evi1 to suppress apoptosis is not restricted to TGFβ-mediated cell death, since Evi1 also protects intestinal epithelial cells from taxol-mediated apoptosis. Evi1 is overexpressed in some human colon cancer cell lines, and overexpression is associated with amplification of the Evi1 gene. Knockdown of Evi1 by siRNA inhibited AKT phosphorylation in HT-29 human colon cancer cells and increased their sensitivity to taxol-mediated apoptosis. These data indicate that Evi1 functions as a survival gene in intestinal epithelial cells and colon cancer cells, activating PI3K/AKT and conveying resistance to both physiological and therapeutic apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2009503121,"The link between defects in BRCA1 and breast cancer development may be best understood by deciphering the role of associated proteins. BRCA1 associated C-terminal helicase (BACH1) interacts directly with the BRCA1 C-terminal BRCT repeats, which are important for BRCA1 DNA repair and are mutated in the majority of BRCA1 familial cancers. Thus, BACH1 is a likely candidate for mediating BRCA1 DNA repair and tumor suppression functions. Although previous evidence using overexpression of a dominant negative BACH1 has suggested that BACH1 is involved in BRCA1-DNA repair function, our results using BACH1 deficient cells provide direct evidence for involvement of BACH1 in DNA repair as well as for localizing BRCA1. Following DNA damage BACH1 is modified by phosphorylation, displays a BRCA1-like nuclear foci pattern and colocalizes with γ-H2AX. Given that the BACH1/BRCA1 complex is unaltered by DNA damage and the intensity of BRCA1 foci is diminished in BACH1 deficient cells, BACH1 may serve to not only facilitate DNA repair, but also maintain BRCA1 in DNA damage foci."

These crystals develop from membrane cholesterol domains, a process that is accelerated under conditions of hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. In this study, the comparative effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on oxidative stress-induced cholesterol domain formation were tested in model membranes containing physiologic levels of cholesterol using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches. In the absence of HMG-CoA reductase, only the atorvastatin active o-hydroxy metabolite (ATM) blocked membrane cholesterol domain formation as a function of oxidative stress. This effect of ATM is attributed to electron donation and proton stabilization mechanisms associated with its phenoxy group located in the membrane hydrocarbon core.

The results of this study indicate that ATM inhibits cholesterol domain formation by a potent antioxidant mechanism. Materials—1,2-diarachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DAPC), 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-o-leoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and stored at -80 °C in high-performance liquid chromatography grade chloroform until use. Other chemical reagents and drugs were purchased from Sigma, Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ), and Calbiochem. Atorvastatin and its active o-hydroxy metabolite (ATM) were provided by Pfizer, Inc. The chemical structures of ATM and the other compounds used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Preparation of Human LDL for Peroxidation Analysis—Human LDL was obtained from Calbiochem and preserved by EDTA. The EDTA was removed prior to peroxidation experiments by gel filtration with PD-10 Sephadex G-25 M columns equilibrated with 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Following the loading of LDL, the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the eluant was collected and analyzed for protein content. The relevant fraction was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to obtain a final protein concentration of 50 μg/ml for the peroxidation assays. Determination of Malondialdehyde Levels in LDL—Malondialdehyde (MDA), a reactive aldehyde produced by LDL lipid peroxidation, was quantitated by measuring its reaction with thiobarbituric acid to form a stable chromogen referred to as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) (21Mak I.T. Weglicki W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The concentration of MDA was confirmed based on a standard curve for MDA·TBA complex using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane after acid hydrolysis. In these assays, LDL was incubated for 30 min with vehicle or ATM. The oxidation reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C. For measurement of TBARS, 100 μl of sample was removed after 2 h and combined with 1 ml of 0.5% TBA, 10 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and aliquots of EDTA and butylated hydroxytoluene to produce a final concentration of 20 μm for each. After incubation at 100 °C for 30 min, the samples were cooled, and the absorbances were measured at 532 nm to calculate TBARS levels. The molar extinction coefficient for TBARS is 1.56 × 105 m-1 cm-1. Preparation of Multilamellar Lipid Vesicles (MLVs) for Lipid Peroxidation and X-ray Diffraction Analyses—For lipid peroxidation and x-ray diffraction analyses, MLVs were prepared from phospholipid and cholesterol at specific mole ratios (0.2-0.6). Aliquots of lipid (1.0-5.0 mg) were transferred to 13 × 100-mm test tubes and dried down under a steady stream of N2 gas while vortexing vigorously for 3 min. Residual solvent was removed under vacuum in low light conditions. Lipid samples were then resuspended in diffraction buffer (0.5 mm HEPES, 154.0 mm NaCl, pH, 7.3), and vortex was mixed at ambient temperature to form MLVs, as described previously (22Bangham A.D. Standish M.M. Watkins J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 238-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3645) Google Scholar). Determination of F2-Isoprostanes by Gas Chromatography (GC) with Negative Chemical Ionization Mass Spectroscopy (MS)—F2-Isoprostanes are derived principally from the formation of positioned peroxyl radical isomers of arachidonic acid, endocyclization to prostaglandin H2-like structures, and reduction to prostaglandin F2-like compounds. Total levels of F2-isoprostanes were measured in MLVs reconstituted from DAPC prepared in the presence of vehicle or various statins and Trolox (100 nm), using GC-MS with negative chemical ionization as described by Walter et al. (23Walter M.F. Blumberg J.B. Dolnikowski G.G. Handelman G.J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MLVs were allowed to autoxidize for 48 h at 37 °C, and peroxidation was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 5.0 mm EDTA and 20 μl of 35.0 mm butylated hydroxytoluene. F2-Isoprostane formation was independently analyzed in blinded samples by mass spectroscopy in the Antioxidant Research Laboratory, Tufts University, Boston, MA. Lipid Hydroperoxide Measurements in MLVs—For these experiments, 500 μl of MLVs reconstituted from DLPC (1.0 mg/ml) was freshly prepared in diffraction buffer in the absence and presence of freshly prepared ATM or Trolox at various concentrations. The vesicles were immediately placed in a shaking water bath at 37 °C and allowed to undergo gradual peroxidation without the use of exogenous initiators. After a 48-h incubation period to allow for autoxidation, 100-μl aliquots of the samples were removed, and the peroxidation reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 5.0 mm EDTA and 20 μl of 35.0 mm butylated hydroxytoluene. The extent of lipid peroxidation in the samples was measured by the CHOD-iodide assay (24El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. el-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CHOD colorimetric assay is based on the spectrophotometric measurement of triiodide (I3-), which has a molar absorptivity value (ϵ) of 2.46 × 104 m-1 cm-1 at 365 nm. The molar quantity of I3- is directly proportional to the quantity of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) that is formed in the process of lipid peroxidation. One ml of CHOD color reagent was added to each aliquot followed by incubation in the absence of light for 4 h. Sample absorbances were then measured at 365 nm. Lipid peroxide concentration values were expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 6). Preparation of Oriented Membranes for Small Angle X-ray Diffraction Analysis—The effect of lipid peroxidation on cholesterol crystalline formation was measured in MLVs reconstituted from DAPC and cholesterol at specific mole ratios. The final phospholipid concentration was 2.5 mg/ml, and the mole ratio of cholesterol-to-phospholipid was 0, 0.2, and 0.6. The mole ratio of drug-to-phospholipid was 1:100-1:15, resulting in low final concentrations that range between 0.1 and 5.0%, by mass. MLVs were oriented for diffraction analysis by centrifugation in a Sorvall AH-629 swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor at 35,000 g for 50 min at 5 °C. Samples were then placed in hermetically sealed canisters in which temperature and relative humidity (74%) were controlled, as described previously in detail (25Chester D.W. Herbette L.G. Mason R.P. Joslyn A.F. Triggle D.J. Koppel D.E. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ultrastructure of the lipid vesicles was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and shown to form stable lipid bilayers. Small Angle X-ray Diffraction Analysis of Lipid and Cholesterol Domain Structures—Small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to examine the effects of oxidative stress on membrane structure and the molecular location of statins. X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted by aligning the samples at grazing incidence with respect to a collimated x-ray source (CuKα radiation; λ = 1.54 Å). In addition to direct calibration of the detector system, cholesterol monohydrate crystals were used to verify the calibration, sample-to-detector distance, and location of the main beam, as described previously (26Mason R.P. Gonye G.E. Chester D.W. Herbette L.G. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The unit cell periodicity (d-space) of the membrane lipid bilayer was calculated using Bragg's law. Corrected diffraction orders obtained from samples in this study were analyzed using Fourier summation to yield one-dimensional electron density profiles (Å versus electrons/Å3)ofthe membrane lipid bilayer. A detailed explanation of membrane diffraction analysis was described previously (26Mason R.P. Gonye G.E. Chester D.W. Herbette L.G. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. The significance of differences between results from independent experimental conditions (conducted in triplicate) was tested using either the two-tailed Student's t test (isoprostane experiment and LOOH inhibition measurements) or one-way analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keul's post hoc analysis (dose-dependent effects of ATM on LOOH and TBARS production in MLVs and LDL, respectively). A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effect of Oxidative Stress on Organization of Membrane Lipids—X-ray diffraction analysis of membrane vesicles consisting of phospholipid and cholesterol produced strong and reproducible diffraction orders that corresponded to distinct structures in the membrane (e.g. cholesterol domains, phospholipid-rich regions), as shown in Fig. 2. The d-space measurement refers to the average molecular width of the membrane, including surface hydration, with a resolution of 1 Å or 0.1 nm. Although a typical phospholipid bilayer has a molecular width of ∼50 Å (depending on acyl chain length, degree of saturation, cholesterol content, temperature), the pure cholesterol crystalline domain has a fixed width of 34 Å, indicating a sterol bilayer (a single cholesterol molecule has a long dimension of 17 Å) (27Craven B.M. Nature. 1976; 260: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Ruocco M.J. Shipley G.G. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 695-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As a function of lipid peroxidation in MLVs prepared with DAPC, we observed pronounced changes in the structure and organization of vesicle lipids, including the formation of cholesterol crystalline domains and reduced membrane width. Following lipid peroxidation in vesicles containing relatively low cholesterol content (0.2 C/P), there was evidence for pronounced aggregation of cholesterol into crystalline microdomains that could be detected as early as 4 h but dominated the samples after a 12-h period (Fig. 3). The highly reproducible width of the cholesterol domain (d = 34 Å) indicated that the sterol formed a “tail-to-tail” bilayer that, once formed, was inert, irreversible, and unaffected by changes in sample temperature or hydration. In addition to the formation of cholesterol crystalline domains, lipid peroxidation produced a marked reduction in the width of the surrounding sterol-poor membrane as a function of time. Over a 12-h period, for example, the membrane width was reduced from 53 to 46 Å following oxidative stress. This reduction in membrane width was accompanied by a progressive increase in cholesterol domain formation. By 16 h, there was no further evidence of phospholipid bilayer structure due to extensive damage to the phospholipid acyl chains (Fig. 3). The amount of cholesterol in the membranes also affected domain formation. After 4 h, clear evidence for cholesterol domains was observed at a 0.2 C/P mole ratio (Fig. 3); at a 0.6 C/P mole ratio, cholesterol domains were observed as early as 2.5 h (data not shown). As an additional control experiment, we evaluated the effects of oxidative stress on membrane lipid vesicles (DAPC) prepared in the absence and presence of increasing cholesterol levels. The membrane samples prepared without cholesterol were inherently more disordered than those prepared with cholesterol, as evidenced by a membrane width of only 48 Å. As expected, these samples did not show evidence of domains of 34 Å width, even after 16 h of lipid peroxidation. Despite the absence of cholesterol domains, there was still a marked reduction in membrane width of these samples (48-41 Å) due to extensive oxidative damage to the phospholipid acyl chains (data not shown). Comparative Effect of ATM, Statins, and Trolox on Cholesterol Domain Development—As the formation of separate cholesterol domains was attributed to oxidative stress, we tested the effect of synthetic and natural chain breaking antioxidants on lipid organization. ATM has been shown to have potent antioxidant activity, as compared with the parent compound (10Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Bisgaier C.L. Newton R.S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 138: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In this study, progressive inhibition of cholesterol crystal formation was achieved by treating membranes with various concentrations of ATM, as compared with untreated samples. With ATM treatment, domain formation was not observed for 24 h until the concentration of the drug was reduced to 2 mol %. By contrast, other statins (atorvastatin parent, pravastatin, rosuvastatin) had no inhibitory effect on cholesterol crystalline domain formation under identical conditions (Fig. 4). In addition, cholesterol crystal formation was not inhibited by Trolox but was effectively blocked by the synthetic antioxidant, probucol. The comparative effects of these agents on cholesterol crystallization are reviewed in Fig. 4. Membrane Location of Statins—Fourier analysis of the diffraction data was used to produce a one-dimensional electron density profile (Å versus electrons/Å3) of the centrosymmetric membrane lipid bilayer. Two peaks of electron density of the electron density profile correspond to the center-of-mass positions of the phospholipid headgroups (Fig. 5A). A nadir of electron density associated with the terminal methylene segments of the phospholipid acyl chains was also observed, due to the high ratio of hydrogen to carbon and low molecular density. Sample electron density profiles were directly subtracted from control samples to calculate the equilibrium location of drug molecules in the membrane. In membranes reconstituted from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine and cholesterol, the addition of ATM produced a well defined increase in electron density in the membrane hydrocarbon core with a center-of-mass distribution of ∼16 Å from the hydrocarbon core center (Fig. 5B). This location is consistent with strong lipophilic interactions between ATM and the phospholipid acyl chains. Specifically, these findings suggest that the long axis of ATM intercalates into the upper hydrocarbon core, adjacent to the headgroup region. This equilibrium membrane location of ATM may be necessary for access to the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. Additionally, this membrane location places the o-hydroxy moiety in the region of the conjugated double bonds of the phospholipid bilayer, where it may participate in proton donation mechanisms to attenuate the propagation of free radicals. By contrast, the equilibrium membrane location for the hydrophilic statin, pravastatin, was restricted to the hydrated surface of the membrane with a center-of-mass location ∼10 Å from ATM (Fig. 5C). Based on these data, we propose a membrane orientation for ATM that places its phenoxy group in close proximity to the conjugated double bonds of adjacent phospholipids (Fig. 5D); however, given the specific interaction of aromatic structures with lipid bilayers (29de Planque M.R. Bonev B.B. Demmers J.A. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Separovic F. Watts A. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5341-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), other orientations may be possible. ATM Inhibits Isoprostane Formation in MLVs—Isoprostanes are prostaglandin isomers that can be generated non-enzymatically by free radical modification of arachidonic acid associated with phospholipid in LDL and cellular membranes. These products of oxidative modification contribute to inflammatory processes and are associated with the atherosclerotic plaque (30Roberts L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 31Pratico D. Iuliano L. Mauriello A. Spagnoli L. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. Maclouf J. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2028-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of ATM on peroxidation of lipid vesicles enriched with arachidonic acid (DAPC), the substrate for non-enzymatic formation of isoprostanes (Fig. 6). The results of this experiment demonstrated that the addition of ATM at 100 nm significantly (p < 0.01, n = 3) reduced isoprostane levels by 30%, as compared with vehicle-treated controls (14.00 ± 2.46 ng/ml to 9.87 ± 1.70 ng/ml). By contrast, there was not a significant change in isoprostane levels in samples treated with simvastatin (14.42 ± 0.96 ng/ml; p = 0.75, n = 3), rosuvastatin (14.20 ± 3.51 ng/ml; p = 0.90, n = 3), or Trolox (12.97 ± 1.68 ng/ml; p = 0.22, n = 3). There was a reduction in isoprostane levels with atorvastatin parent by 11%, but it was not statistically significant (12.35 ± 1.68 ng/ml; p = 0.22, n = 3) (Fig. 6). Additionally, levels of the reactive aldehyde, MDA, were significantly (p < 0.01, n = 3) reduced in the presence of ATM by 20% from 1.29 ± 0.11 to 1.03 ± 0.07 μm at 37 °C, whereas significant inhibition was not observed for atorvastatin parent and other statins (data not shown). ATM Inhibits Lipid Peroxidation in LDL and MLVs—We tested the dose-dependent effects of ATM on peroxidation in MLVs enriched with PUFAs (linoleic acid) and human LDL. ATM inhibited oxidation in lipid vesicles over a broad range of concentrations (100 nm through 10.0 μm) to reproduce pharmacologic conditions. There was a dose-dependent decrease in LOOH levels, an early modification of PUFAs, as a function of ATM treatment. The EC50 for ATM in the MLV samples was 1.0 μm, with significant reductions at a concentration as low as 100 nm (Fig. 7A). Over a range of concentrations that reproduce pharmacologic conditions (100 nm through 2.0 μm), ATM caused a pronounced and dose-dependent reduction in TBARS levels in human LDL (Fig. 7B). TBARS levels indicate the generation of reactive aldehydes such as MDA, an atherogenic product of LDL oxidation. At the highest dose tested (2.0 μm), ATM produced more than an 80% reduction in LDL oxidation, as compared with vehicle-treated samples. Antioxidant Activity of Vitamin E Reduced in Cholesterol-enriched Membranes—The comparative antioxidant effects of vitamin E and ATM were tested in DAPC-enriched MLVs as a function of increasing cholesterol content. We have previously shown in animal feeding studies that the C/P mole ratio in animal vascular tissue increases dramatically under conditions of hyperlipidemia (2Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in cell plasma membrane cholesterol content may have important effects on protein function and drug interactions. To directly test the effect of cholesterol content on antioxidant effects, we examined the activity of vitamin E in lipid vesicles prepared with increasing ratios of cholesterol and phospholipid. As shown in Fig. 8, there was a strong inverse relationship between the ability of vitamin E (500 nm) to inhibit lipid hydroperoxide formation and the C/P ratio in the lipid vesicles. The inhibition of LOOH decreased from 26% at a 0.4:1 mole ratio to 19 and 6% at elevated C/P ratios of 0.8 and 1.2, respectively. By contrast, the inhibition of LOOH with ATM remained constant at 38% over the entire range of C/P mole ratios, even at a ratio as high as 1.6 (Fig. 9). The other statins tested (pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin) or an alternative hypolipidemic therapy (ezetimibe) did not inhibit LOOH formation in these lipid vesicles (data not shown).FIGURE 9Comparative antioxidant effects of ATM and vitamin E in membranes enriched with cholesterol. ATM and vitamin E (each at 500 nm) were incubated with DLPC lipid vesicles (1.0 mg/ml) containing a ratio of cholesterol-to-phospholipid of 1.6:1. Peroxidation of lipids occurred over time in the absence of any exogenous initiators at 37 °C for 48 h. Total levels of LOOH were measured by the CHOD-iodide assay based on the spectrophotometric measurement of triiodide (I3-). The molar quantity of I3- is directly proportional to the quantity of LOOH that is formed in the process. Values are mean ± S.D. (n = 3), *, p < 0.01 versus vehicle or vitamin E treated samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The essential observation from this study was that the ATM inhibited changes in membrane lipid structure and organization, including cholesterol domain formation, following oxidative stress. The effects of ATM were attributed to antioxidant activity and observed in membrane samples containing physiologic levels of sterol and phospholipid with various PUFAs. Oxidative modification of the membrane lipids caused the aggregation of unesterified membrane cholesterol into highly ordered, crystalline domains (width = 34 Å). In addition to interfering with cholesterol crystal development, ATM reduced changes in membrane width associated with lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant activity of ATM is attributed to electron donation and proton stabilization mechanisms associated with its phenoxy group located in the membrane hydrocarbon core. A similar effect was observed with probucol, a lipophilic molecule that overlaps the location of ATM in the membrane but not other statins that do not share this membrane location (e.g. pravastatin) or phenoxy constituent (atorvastatin parent). This may represent an atheroprotective property for ATM as formation of cholesterol crystals contributes to mechanisms of cell death and inflammation (3Phillips J.E. Geng Y.J. Mason R.P. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 159: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Kellner-Weibel G. Yancey P.G. Jerome W.G. Walser T. Mason R.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H.

Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and, once formed, these crystals do not respond to pharmacologic intervention or reverse cholesterol transport mechanisms. These findings support earlier studies showing that oxidative modification of phospholipid acyl chains promote the organization of cholesterol into highly ordered, crystalline structures, even in lipid vesicles containing normal or low cholesterol levels (8Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39380-39387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The basis for this effect on cholesterol aggregation is attributed to a loss in normal phospholipid-sterol interactions resulting from oxidative damage to PUFAs, a common and essential constituent of most biological membranes. Oxidation of membrane phospholipid acyl chains is a free radical reaction by which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the PUFA moiety following abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the bisallylic methylene group. These chemical modifications alter the structure of the phospholipid molecule, disrupting their physico-chemical interactions with other lipid constituents, such as van der Waals interactions with neighboring phospholipids, especially those containing extended and saturated fatty acyl chains (32Lund-Katz S. Laboda H.M. McLean L.R. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3416-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Further studies of cholesterol domain formation in vesicles enriched with other phospholipid molecules, including those containing mixed acyl chains (e.g. sphingomyelin), are warranted as a function of oxidative stress. In addition to the formation of cholesterol crystalline domains, we observed that oxidative damage to the membrane lipids causes a significant and irreversible reduction in membrane width. This decrease is attributed to chemical modification of the lipid acyl chains, including cleavage into reactive aldehydes. Additionally, as cholesterol was sequestered into these crystalline structures, the overall amount of cholesterol in the surrounding phospholipid bilayer decreased, resulting in increased trans-gauche isomerizations in the phospholipid acyl chains and reduced membrane width. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated an important role for cholesterol in maintaining membrane width and lipid dynamics essential for function (2Tulenko T.N. Chen M. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Chang H.M. Reitstetter R. Mason R.P. Gruener R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such a reduction in membrane width would be expected to have pronounced effects on normal structure-function relationships for membrane-bound ion transport proteins and other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways (33Chang H.M. Reitstetter R. Mason R.P. Gruener R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Chen M. Mason R.P. Tulenko T.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the cardiovascular risk factors associated with oxidative stress (e.g. hypertension, diabetes) (7Madamanchi N.R. Vendrov A. Runge M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) could accelerate the abnormal deposition of cholesterol into crystalline domains, even in patients with normal cholesterol levels in the vessel wall. Levels of oxidized lipid, as measured by TBARS or monoclonal antibodies against oxidized LDL, correlate with the severity of acute coronary syndromes and plaque instability (35Ehara S. Ueda M. Naruko T. Haze K. Itoh A. Otsuka M. Komatsu R. Matsuo T. Itabe H. Takano T. Tsukamoto Y. Yoshiyama M. Takeuchi K. Yoshikawa J. Becker A.E.

Cardiol. 2004; 44: 1996-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In a longitudinal investigation of 634 patients, we found that elevated levels of oxidized lipid in the plasma were associated with a 3-4-fold increase in the relative risk for major vascular events and procedures over a 3-year period (37Walter M.F. Jacob R.F. Jeffers B. Ghadanfar M.M. Preston G.M. Buch J. Mason R.P. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 1996-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The predictive effect of TBARS was observed in a multivariate model adjusted for inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), interleukin-6) and other risk factors (age, LDL, high density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, and blood pressure). This analysis showed an independent effect of oxidized lipids on major vascular events and procedures. Despite this link between oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk, it has been demonstrated that antioxidant (e.g. vitamin E) supplementation does not appear to be beneficial in reducing events in prospective trials including patients with coronary artery disease (38Jialal I. Devaraj S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 926-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 39Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2107-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for this apparent paradox may be due to trial design, baseline antioxidant status of participants, dosage and source of the antioxidants, and time of intervention relative to disease progression. An additional explanation is that vitamin E does not neutralize relevant oxidants, such as those produced by myeloperoxidase (40Heinecke J.W. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and/or that there is reduced penetration of natural antioxidants into the atherosclerotic plaque (41Micheletta F. Natoli S. Misuraca M. Sbarigia E. Diczfalusy U. Iuliano L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our results support the later hypothesis as we observed a reduction in the activity of vitamin E as a function of increasing membrane cholesterol content (Fig. 8). By contrast, synthetic antioxidants (e.g. probucol), with superior scavenging activity and lipophilic properties, may have beneficial effects on relevant oxidative stress processes in the plaque and thereby beneficially influence the course of the disease. The finding of a novel antioxidant effect for ATM may serve to explain why this statin may reduce clinical events in patients with otherwise normal levels of serum LDL, especially in the presence of other risk factors that contribute to oxidative stress pathways (e.g. hypertension, diabetes), as observed in recent clinical trials, such as the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) (18Sever P.S. Dahlof B. Poulter N.R. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). As reported in the Physicians' Desk Reference (42Physicians' Desk Reference. 59th Ed. Thomson PDR, Montvale, NJ2005: 2585Google Scholar), 70% of the atorvastatin is present in the serum in the form of hydroxy metabolites that are active inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike other statins, ATM has the same enzymatic activity as its parent. Atorvastatin treatment has been successfully used to reduce the risk and progression of cardiovascular disease (16Cannon C.P.

A small clinical study that measured protein oxidation markers (e.g. dityrosine, nitrotyrosine) showed that treatment with atorvastatin caused a significant decrease in these oxidation products. Interestingly, reductions in oxidation markers were observed at its lowest dose (10 mg) over just 12 weeks (15Shishehbor M.H. Brenna M.L. Aviles R.J. Fu X. Penn M.S. Sprecher D.L. Hazen S.L. Circulation. 2003; 108: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In a larger study of 2341 patients, treatment with a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg) caused a significant reduction in levels of oxidized lipids on all apoB-100 particles after just a 16-week period (14Tsimikas S.

Comparative studies into the effects of atorvastatin versus other statins on biomarkers of oxidative stress are currently underway and will provide additional insight into this potential non-LDL mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2023643761,"The cell cycle inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 is among the most important mediators of the tumor suppressor p53. However, there is increasing evidence indicating that p21 could favor tumorigenesis in specific cell types. In particular, the absence of p21 delays the development of thymic lymphomas induced either by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated deficiency or by ionizing irradiation. Here, we extend these observations to the context of p53-deficient mice. The absence of p21 results in a significant extension of the lifespan of p53-null and p53-haploinsufficient mice, and this effect can be attributed exclusively to a decrease in the incidence of spontaneous thymic lymphomas. Specifically, despite the occurrence of a variety of tumor types in the context of p53 deficiency, the only tumors that were significantly impaired by the absence of p21 were thymic lymphomas. Moreover, the absence of p21 also delays the incidence of radiation-induced thymic lymphomas in p53-deficient mice. Interestingly, p21-deficient lymphomas have a higher apoptotic rate than p21-proficient lymphomas, and this could be on the basis of the delayed incidence of thymic lymphomas in the absence of p21. Together, our results indicate that p21 plays an oncogenic role restricted to thymic lymphomas that is mechanistically independent of p53 and associated to a lower tumor apoptotic rate."

Reaction of NO with superoxide forms peroxynitrite with resultant protein thiol nitrosylation, tyrosine nitration, DNA damage, and excessive activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (2Szabo C. Nitric Oxide. 2006; 14: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PARP-1 is the prototypical and most highly expressed member of the PARP gene family, which contains at least seven members in mammalian species (3Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G.

The second most abundant non-histone nuclear protein, PARP-1 is a DNA nick sensor that uses NAD as a substrate to catalyze the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) to acceptor proteins, in particular histones, several transcription factors, and PARP itself, thereby regulating their activities and functions (4Kraus W.L.

Excessive activation of PARP-1 by peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage during oxidative and nitrosative stress in ischemia-reperfusion injury, inflammation, and diabetes mellitus can cause cell death by NAD+/ATP depletion (2Szabo C.

PARP-1 knock-out mice, for example, are resistant to ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation, and this protection is associated with reduced iNOS gene expression (18Boulares A.H. Zoltoski A.J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). S-nitrosylation appears to be a regulated process, influenced by Ca2+, growth factors, and developmental transitions in diverse tissues (29Gow A.J. Chen Q. Hess D.T. Day B.J. Ischiropoulos H. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9637-9640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The range of transcription factors potentially subject to regulation by S-nitrosylation during oxidative or nitrosative stress has not been catalogued. The excessive production of NO during activated states can injure host tissues by an “innocent bystander” effect. Therefore, NO-dependent negative feedback regulation of iNOS gene transcription would offer an efficient mechanism to terminate high output NO production. For example NF-κB, a key transactivator of the iNOS gene, is subject to NO-mediated S-nitrosylation, which inhibits its ability to bind the iNOS promoter and results in down-regulation of iNOS gene transcription (24Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Similarly, NO up-regulates the iNOS inhibitor osteopontin, resulting in enhanced osteopontin-mediated inhibition of iNOS expression (26Gao C. Guo H. Wei J. Mi Z. Wai P. Kuo P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that PARP-1 is a NO-sensitive activator of cytokine-induced iNOS transcription in glomerular mesangial cells and that NO-mediated S-nitrosylation of PARP-1 occurs and may account for feedback inhibition of the iNOS promoter. Cell Culture and Reagents—Mouse mesangial cells (ATCC CRL-1927) were maintained in Ham's F12 plus Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Vehicle, IL-1β (10 ng/ml), l-NAME (100 μg/ml), l-NIL (1 mm), l-arginine (10 μm), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 100 μm), S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO; 10 μm), or 2–4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO; 10 μm) was added to the cells as indicated in the text and figure legends. Mouse recombinant IL-1β was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was from Invitrogen. The Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system and the luciferase vectors pGL3-Basic and pRL-SV40 were from Promega. The BCA protein estimation kit was from Pierce Chemical, and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Mammalian short hairpin RNA expression plasmid pKD-PARP-v2, which contains the PARP-1 targeting sequence (sense strand) 5′-GAGCCTTCAGGAGTTGTTCTT-3′, and its negative control plasmid pKD-NegCon-v1, which contains the unrelated sequence (sense strand) 5′-AGTCATCGACTAGCCTTACTT-3′, were purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-nitrocysteine and anti-PARP-1 antibodies were from A. G. Scientific (San Diego, CA) and Alexis (San Diego, CA), respectively. Anti-Oct-1 and anti-Oct-3/4 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmids—Serial 5′-deletion constructs corresponding to murine iNOS promoter regions –915/+137, –849/+137, –805/+137, and –752/+137 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGL3-Basic vector at Mlu I and BglII sites. The resultant plasmids were designated piNOS(–915/+137)-luc, piNOS(–849/+137)-luc, piNOS(–805/+137)-luc, and piNOS(–752/+137)-luc. Site-directed mutation of the –859/–850 iNOS promoter element (5′-AATTATAATT-3′ replaced with 5′-CCCCAGCCCC-3′; mutations are underlined) in piNOS-luc was accomplished by PCR splicing by overlap extension, using the wild-type iNOS promoter DNA as a template. The resulting construct was designated piNOS(–915Δ–859/–850/+137)-luc. All plasmids were sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of spurious mutations. Transient Transfections—Mesangial cells were seeded in 24-well plates, grown to 90–95% confluency in complete medium without antibiotics, and transfected the following day using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol and a total of 1 μg/well of plasmid DNAs. Where necessary, the amount of transfected plasmid DNA was kept constant by addition of appropriate amounts of the parental empty expression vector. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by cotransfection with 20 ng/well of the Renilla luciferase expression plasmid pRL-SV40. As indicated in the text and figure legends, vehicle, IL-1β, l-NAME, l-NIL, S-nitroso-glutathione, SNAP, or C-PTIO was added after transfection for 24 h before cell lysates were prepared. For RNA interference, mesangial cells grown on 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of piNOS-luc and 0.5 μg of pKD-NegCon-v1 or pKD-PARP-v2 along with 20 ng of pRL-SV40 using Lipofectamine reagent. The efficiency and specificity of siRNA gene knockdown of PARP-1 was determined by Western blotting for PARP-1 and α-tubulin expression. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from time-paired vehicle-, IL-1β-treated mesangial cells as detailed in our earlier work (30Gupta A.K. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276 (Pt. 2): F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gupta A.K. Diaz R.A. Higham S. Kone B.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2239-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide -8655′-GTAAGAAATTATAATTTATTCGTT-3′-842 from the murine iNOS promoter or a mutated form of the probe 5′-GTAAGACCCCAGCCCCTATTCGTT-3′ (mutations underlined; designated “Δ–865/–842 oligo” in the figures and legends) was generated for use as probes and for competition studies. The –865/–842 probe was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were performed in 20 μg of solution for 30 min at room temperature by incubating 10 μl of nuclear extract protein with duplex DNA probe (∼2 × 105 cpm) in reaction buffer (13 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 65 mm NaCl, 0.14 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, and 50 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC). For supershift assays, antibodies specific for PARP-1, Oct-1, or Oct-3/4 or nonimmune IgG were added to the binding reaction and incubated on ice for 10 min before the addition of labeled probe. Aliquots of the reactions were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film with an enhancing screen at –70 °C to detect the DNA-protein and DNA-protein-antibody complexes. Experiments were replicated a minimum of three times as indicated in the figure legends. In Vitro DNase I Footprinting—DNase I footprinting analysis was performed with the Core Footprinting System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and our published work (32Zhang W. Kuncewicz T. Higham S.C. Kone B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A PCR fragment corresponding to –966 to –696 of the murine iNOS 5′-flanking region was generated using piNOS-luc as a template. This fragment was used as a 32P-ATP-labeled DNA template for footprinting and as a 35S-dATP-labeled fragment for DNA sequencing performed with the fmol DNA Cycle Sequencing System (Promega). Southwestern (DNA-Protein) Blotting—Approximately 100 μg of nuclear protein was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the filter air dried. The nitrocellulose was then immersed in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 6 m guanidinium chloride, followed by 8 sequential 2-fold dilutions of guanidinium chloride, with gentle rocking for 10 min at 4 °C each incubation. The nitrocellulose filter was then transferred to binding buffer containing 3 m guanidinium chloride and gently rocked for 10 min at 4 °C. The final wash step lacked guanidinium chloride. The nitrocellulose was prehybridized in binding buffer containing 5% gelatin and 5 mg/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose filter was then immersed in binding buffer containing 0.25% gelatin and 5 mg/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and incubated for 30 min. 32P-dCTP-labeled –865/–842 iNOS DNA probe (sense strand 5′-GTAAGAAATTATAATTTATTCGTT-3′) was added to the binding buffer containing 0.25% gelatin and 5 mg/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and incubated with the nitrocellulose filter overnight at room temperature. The filter was then washed four times with binding buffer for 5 min at room temperature, air dried, and autoradiographed at –80 °C with an intensifying screen. Purification of DNA-binding Protein—The DNA-binding protein was isolated by reacting the biotinylated DNA-protein complex with streptavidin paramagnetic particles (Dynal Biotech Inc.), using the protocol described by Gao et al. (26Gao C. Guo H. Wei J. Mi Z. Wai P. Kuo P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins from mesangial cells were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C with HPLC-purified biotinylated –865/–842 iNOS DNA probe containing the identified binding site bound to Dynabeads M280 streptavidin in protein binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 2.5 mm DTT). The magnetic beads were washed three times with protein binding buffer in 100 mm NaCl containing excess nonbinding poly(dI-dC) competitor DNA. Serial elutions were performed using elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm DTT). The fractions were typically stored at –80 °C prior to subsequent use. Protein Sequencing—Proteins were identified in the Proteomics Core Facility at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and silver. For protein identification, bands were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel proteolytic digestion with trypsin essentially as described by Simpson and co-workers (33Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After extraction of the peptides, an aliquot was separated by HPLC on a C18 75 μ × 10 cm reverse phase capillary column (Vydac 218MS3.07510). The column was developed with a gradient of 2–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, 0.005% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The nanospray source was fitted with a 30-μm coated tapered fused silica tip (New Objective, Cambridge, MA) used to elute the peptides directly into the mass spectrometer for tandem mass spectrometry analysis, which was performed on an Applied Biosystems QStar XL LC/MS/MS mass spectrometer equipped with an LC Packings HPLC for capillary chromatography. The HPLC was coupled to the mass spectrometer by a nanospray electrospray ionization head for direct analysis of the eluate. The QSTAR was operated in Information-dependent Acquisition mode, using a 1-s survey scan followed by two consecutive 3-s product ion scans of 2+, 3+, and 4+ parent ions (m/z 350–1500). Identification was performed on MASCOT with an MS and MS/MS mass tolerance of 0.15 Da. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP analysis was performed using chromatin from vehicle-, IL-1β-, l-NAME + IL-1β-, or SNAP + l-NAME + IL-1β-treated mesangial cells. Chromatin was fixed and immunoprecipitated using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's protocol as described in detail in our previous work (34Yu Z. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F496-F502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-PARP-1 antibody or rabbit nonimmune IgG. The presence of the selected DNA sequence was assessed by PCR using primers framing the murine iNOS promoter region of interest: forward primer, 5′-TGCTAGGGGGATTTTCCCTCTCTC-3′ (nucleotides –978 to –955), and reverse primer, 5′-AGCCTTTAATCCCGGGATTCAGG-3′ (nucleotides –732 to –710). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C × 3 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C × 1 min, 52 °C × 1 min, and 72 °C × 1 min; final elongation at 72 °C × 10 min. PCR for the input was performed with genomic DNA. The input fraction corresponded to 1% of the chromatin solution before immunoprecipitation. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Vehicle or IL-1β-treated mesangial cells were harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). These lysates were then precleared by incubating with 20 μl/ml of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4°C. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with the anti-nitrocysteine antibody or control IgG in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads and incubation for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and probed with anti-PARP-1 antibody (0.2 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed extensively with a solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by the ECL protocol using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. Biotin-Switch Method to Detect S-Nitrosylated Proteins—S-Nitrosylated proteins in nuclear protein fractions from mesangial cells that had been treated with vehicle or SNAP were selectively biotinylated and purified using our minor modification (35Kuncewicz T. Sheta E.A. Goldknopf I.L. Kone B.C. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 156-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) of the biotin-switch protocol established by Jaffrey et al. (36Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were then analyzed by PARP-1 immunoblot analysis. Data Analysis—Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by analysis of variance. Significance was assigned at p < 0.05. NO-sensitive Inhibition of the iNOS Promoter—To localize potential NO-sensitive cis-acting elements in the murine iNOS promoter, iNOS promoter deletion constructs fused to the firefly luciferase gene, designated piNOS(–915/+137)-luc, piNOS(–849/+137)-luc, piNOS-(–805/+137)-luc, and piNOS(–752/+137)-luc, were transiently transfected into mesangial cells. The nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor l-NAME was used to inhibit endogenous NO production. The cells were subsequently treated with vehicle, IL-1β, or IL-1β + l-NAME, and the fold induction of iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity was measured. Using this strategy, the region –915/–849 was determined to be uniquely NO sensitive, because l-NAME blockade of IL-1β-stimulated endogenous NO production resulted in greatly enhanced luciferase activity compared with cells exposed to endogenously produced NO (IL-1β without l-NAME) (Fig. 1A). None of the iNOS promoter deletion-luciferase constructs exhibited appreciable luciferase activity in the absence of IL-1β. The piNOS(–915/+137)-luc was studied in further detail, using SNAP as an exogenous NO donor in the presence of IL-1β + l-NAME (Fig. 1B). The piNOS (–915/+137)-luc exhibited enhanced activity in the IL-1β + l-NAME-treated cells, but this was reversed by co-administration of SNAP with IL-1β + l-NAME. In fact, the IL-1β + l-NAME + SNAP-treated cells exhibited slightly lower levels of luciferase activity compared with cells exposed to IL-1β alone (Fig. 1B). However, co-administration of the NO scavenger C-PTIO significantly limited the ability of SNAP to reverse the induction of piNOS (–915/+137)-luc activity in IL-1β + l-NAME-treated cells (Fig. 1B). As seen in Fig. 1C, l-NIL, a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor structurally unrelated to l-NAME, yielded essentially the same results as observed with l-NAME (Fig. 1B), and this effect was overcome by excess l-arginine (Fig. 1C). Moreover, S-nitroso-glutathione, a different NO donor, yielded results comparable with those observed with SNAP (Fig. 1C). In Vitro DNase I Footprinting Analysis—To determine whether a trans-activating factor may reside in the region of the iNOS promoter implicated in the promoter-reporter gene studies, in vitro DNase I footprinting analysis was performed using a radiolabeled PCR amplicon corresponding to nucleotides –966/–696 of the iNOS promoter as template. Nuclear extracts were prepared from control, IL-1β-treated, IL-1β + l-NAME-treated, and IL-1β + l-NAME + SNAP-treated cells. Protected sites in the region –865/–842 were detected in the binding reactions that included nuclear extracts from the vehicle- or IL-1β + l-NAME-treated cells, when compared with the reactions with nuclear extracts from IL-1β- or IL-1β + l-NAME + SNAP-treated cells (Fig. 2A). The sequence of this protected region read as -8655′-GTAAGAAATTATAATTTATTCGTT-3′-842. In the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled full-length probe, this binding was eliminated (data not shown). Computer-assisted inspection of this sequence with the Transcription Element Search System (TESS, www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) revealed a potential consensus binding element for Oct-1 (-8595′-AATTATAATTT-3′-850) within it, but no other consensus binding sites elements were detected. Gel shift studies using the –865/–842 oligomer implicated in the footprinting studies demonstrated sequence-specific DNA-protein complexes under basal conditions in nuclear extracts harvested from mesangial cells (Fig. 2B). The higher molecular weight complex, designated complex I, was up-regulated following IL-1β treatment, whereas complex II consistently was slightly down-regulated after IL-1β treatment. Competition experiments revealed sequence specificity of the DNA binding reaction for complex I, because it was virtually abolished when a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled –865/–842 oligomer was included in the binding reaction but was unchanged when a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled, mutated –865/–842 oligomer, which harbored a 9-base mutation in the –859/–850 region, was present (Fig. 2B). These competition maneuvers did not significantly disrupt complex II (Fig. 2B). These competition studies also suggested that the –859/–850 region was necessary for the DNA-protein interaction comprising complex I.

Loss of both bax and bak is necessary to block cell death induced by such stimuli, indicating a great degree of functional overlap between Bax and Bak.

Using a switchable mouse model of Myc-induced apoptosis in pancreatic β cells, we have shown that Myc induces apoptosis in vivo exclusively through Bax but not Bak. Furthermore, blockade of Myc-induced apoptosis by the inactivation of Bax, but not Bak, eliminates all restraints to the oncogenic potential of Myc, allowing the rapid and synchronous progression of invasive, angiogenic tumors.

In contrast to the BH3-only proteins, which function as transducers of the apoptotic signal upstream of the mitochondria, Bax and Bak also contain BH1 and -2 domains and function at the mitochondrial outer membrane, presumably as pore-forming complexes, to release holocytochrome c in response to diverse afferent stimuli (4Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Consequently, cells lacking both Bax and Bak exhibit marked resistance to diverse pro-apoptotic insults, such as DNA damaging agents and activation of death receptor pathways. In such instances, loss of either Bax or Bak alone exerts no measurable protective effect (3Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice deleted for either bax or bak alone are viable, evidencing either no defects (in the case of Bak) or defects in only a few discrete lineages (in the case of Bax) (5Knudson C.M.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice lacking both Bax and Bak die in early embryogenesis due to the failure of apoptosis in multiple developing tissues (6Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that Bax and Bak exhibit extensive functional degeneracy. Myc is a pleiotropic transcription factor implicated in diverse cellular and tissue processes ranging from cell growth, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis, and angiogenesis to invasion (7Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 8Lutz W. Leon J. Eilers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When active, Myc appears to potentiate all of these diverse biological programs simultaneously, with the outcome depending upon the circumstance, cell type, and local somatic environment of the cell. Myc is deregulated and/or overexpressed in many cancers (11Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). However, recent studies using switchable transgenic animal models have shown that the activation of Myc alone is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis in great part because of the overwhelming tumor-suppressive influence of apoptosis. Consistent with this, secondary oncogenic lesions that suppress apoptosis and/or enhance proliferative rate over that of apoptosis are sufficient to expose the oncogenic potential of Myc (12Baudino T.A. Maclean K.H. Brennan J. Parganas E. Yang C. Aslanian A. Lees J.A. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The pivotal role in tumor suppression played by the innate apoptotic activity of Myc is evident in the well described pIns-MycER-TAM model in which a switchable form of the Myc oncoprotein, MycERTAM, is transgenically targeted to pancreatic β cells via the insulin promoter. Acute activation of MycERTAM triggers abrupt entry of β cells into cycle, but this is accompanied by overwhelming apoptosis that rapidly leads to β cell involution and onset of diabetes. In contrast, when Myc-induced apoptosis in β cells is blocked by co-expression of the apoptosis suppressor Bcl-xL, rapid and synchronous tumorigenesis occurs in all islets (14Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Not only does this demonstrate that apoptosis is a critical restraint to the otherwise potent and pleiotropic oncogenic potential of Myc, but the dramatic anti-apoptotic influence of Bcl-xL also indicates that Myc-induced apoptosis proceeds exclusively through the mitochondrial Bax/Bak pathway, presumably through the activation of specific BH3 proteins that are antagonized by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL proteins. Consistent with this, in vitro experiments indicate that Bax is important in mediating Myc-induced apoptosis (at least in fibroblasts) and that Bax may contribute to limiting the oncogenic potential of Myc (16Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). By contrast, the role of Bak in such tumor-suppressive processes remains undefined. The advantage of the acutely switchable pIns-MycERTAM model is that it allows direct observation of the acute consequences of Myc activation for proliferation and apoptosis in an orthotopic in vivo setting as well as how such acute effects elaborate into tumorigenesis. We have therefore used pIns-MycERTAM mice to assess the relative roles of Bax and Bak in mediating Myc-induced apoptosis and the suppression of Myc-induced tumorigenesis. We show that Myc-induced apoptosis is mediated solely through Bax and not Bak. Moreover, blocking apoptosis by deleting bax unleashes the full potential of Myc to drive the rapid and synchronous formation of angiogenic, invasive β cell tumors. Manipulation of Transgenic Animals—Both pIns-MycERTAM and pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL mice have been described previously (14Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). bax–/– mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) (stock number 002994), whereas bak–/– mice (5Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 6Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A.

Strains were crossed to generate requisite genotypes, which were then verified by PCR analysis on genomic DNA isolated from tail snips. Tamoxifen (1 mg/20 g bodyweight, dissolved in peanut oil) (Sigma) or vehicle control (peanut oil) (Sigma) administration was initiated at 6–8 weeks of age and repeated for up to 12 consecutive days by daily intraperitoneal injection. For each bax or bak genotype, 12 mice were treated: 3 pIns-MycERTAM and three non-transgenic mice with tamoxifen and 3 pIns-MycERTAM and three non-transgenic mice with oil control. Blood glucose (using Accu-Chek strips, Roche Applied Science) and animal weight were monitored before treatment and after 6 and 12 days of tamoxifen administration. All mouse experiments were approved by the University of California at San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Harvesting of Pancreata—Mice were injected with 150 μl of 10 mg/ml BrdUrd (Sigma) solution dissolved in saline 3.5 h before sacrifice, euthanized with CO2 and perfused through the heart with 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline followed by 6 ml of zinc-buffered formaldehyde (Anatech, Battle Creek, MI). Pancreata were harvested and fixed overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated, processed, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned. Histochemistry—Immunohistological detection of insulin, glucagon, PECAM-1 (CD31), as well as hematoxylin and eosin staining, were as described previously (14Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). BrdUrd incorporation and TUNEL 2The abbreviation used is: TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. staining were assayed using, respectively, a Roche Applied Science BrdUrd labeling and detection kit and the Chemicon (Temecula, CA) Apoptag peroxidase kit, according to the manufacturers' instructions, with the modification that sections were then counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Primary antibodies against insulin, Bax (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; 1:50) or Bak (Cell Signaling; 1:200) were applied as described for insulin (14Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Anti-guinea pig-Alexa488 or anti-rabbit-Alexa568 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) were used as secondary antibodies, as appropriate. Sections were embedded in DAKO fluorescent mounting medium containing 1 mg/ml Hoechst 33258 to stain nuclear DNA. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM Meta confocal microscope. Quantification of Apoptosis and Proliferation—Mice were treated with a single injection of tamoxifen and sacrificed 32 h later. TUNEL and BrdUrd staining on pancreas sections was done as above. Apoptotic cells and BrdUrd-positive cells were counted in at least 6 islets/mouse, with a minimum total of 500 β cells. Negligible apoptosis was observed in non-β cells using a double stain for TUNEL and insulin (data not shown). Both Bax and Bak Are Expressed in Pancreatic β Cells—To assess the relative influence of Bax and Bak on Myc-induced tumorigenesis in pancreatic β cells in vivo, we first established that both Bax and Bak proteins are expressed in pancreatic β cells. Pancreata were harvested from bax+/+;bak+/+ mice, fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with antibodies specific for either Bax or Bak proteins. Abundant and comparable staining of both Bax and Bak was observed in β cells of bax+/+;bak+/+ mice (Fig. 1). Bax was expressed at similar levels in both exocrine and endocrine tissue (Fig. 1A), whereas Bak expression was more prominent in the endocrine compartment (Fig. 1B). Analogous staining was performed on pancreas sections from either bax–/– or bak–/– animals, and this confirmed the specificity of the signal of each antibody (Fig. 1). Absence of Bax, but Not Bak, Incapacitates Myc-induced β Cell Apoptosis and Allows Rapid β Cell Expansion—MycERTAM is functionally active only in the presence of its activating ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). MycERTAM was activated in mice in vivo by intraperitoneal administration of tamoxifen, which is then rapidly converted into 4-OHT by the liver. Acute activation of MycERTAM in pancreatic β cells induces both cell cycle entry but also overwhelming apoptosis leading to net β cell involution. As described previously, sustained activation of MycERTAM for 12 days by daily tamoxifen injection induced complete and universal ablation of islet β cells (Fig. 2A) (14Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). To dissect out the respective roles of Bax and Bak in Myc-induced β cell apoptosis, switchable pIns-MycERTAM transgenic mice were crossed into either heterozygous or homozygous bax or bak knock-out backgrounds. MycERTAM was then continuously activated for 12 days, pancreata harvested, and sections stained for insulin to identify β cells in the islets. β cells of animals lacking one or both copies of bak behaved exactly like wild-type β cells, undergoing rapid involution upon activation of Myc. In complete contrast, β cells lacking both copies of bax did not involute and, instead, underwent rapid, synchronous, and progressive expansion, similar to that observed in β cells expressing the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-xL (14Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). β cells in animals lacking only one copy of bax behaved like wild types, undergoing rapid involution (Fig. 2A). Tamoxifen treatment of mice lacking the MycERTAM transgene were unaffected by tamoxifen irrespective of Bax or Bak status, neither involuting nor expanding (Fig. 2B). To ascertain that β cell expansion in the absence of Bax is specifically because of a blockade of Myc-induced apoptosis, we used TUNEL staining to identify apoptotic cells in pancreas sections from mice in which MycERTAM had been continuously activated for 12 days. In each case, sections were co-stained for glucagon to mark the positions of hypo- and hyperplastic islets; glucagon is a marker for insulin-negative islet α cells that do not express MycERTAM and, consequently, do not undergo apoptosis upon tamoxifen treatment. TUNEL-positive cells were evident in the shrunken involuted islets in all tamoxifen-treated pIns-MycERTAM mice in which at least one copy of bax was present (Fig. 3, A and B). In such animals, islet remnants consisted predominantly of glucagon-positive α cells. In normal islets, glucagon-expressing cells represent no more than 10% of the cells in each islet, with the bulk of the remaining cells being β cells. Thus, the great preponderance of α cells in the remnants of involuted islets attests to the extensive apoptotic attrition that Myc induces within the β cell compartment. In contrast, islets from homozygous bax-deficient animals were all markedly hyperplastic with no discernible TUNEL-positive staining. Moreover, such hyperplastic bax–/– islets exhibited a vast excess of β cells over α cells, indicative of selective β cell hyperplasia (Fig. 3B). Of note, islet remnants were never observed in any of the bax–/– mice, indicating that none of the islets had involuted and, consequently, that the hyperplastic islets do not represent a select subset of β cells that expand after Myc activation. Hetero- or homozygous loss of bak exerted no detectable suppressive influence on Myc-induced apoptosis, consistent with the notion that Bak plays no significant role in Myc-dependent apoptosis. No TUNEL staining was evident in control tamoxifen-treated, non-transgenic pancreatic β cells of any genotype (Fig. 3A) nor in pIns-MycERTAM animals of any bax or bak genotype treated with oil carrier instead of tamoxifen. Islets in such animals remained normal throughout (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that tamoxifen treatment of bax–/– pIns-MycERTAM mice somehow leads secondarily to loss of Bak in the islets, we examined Bax and Bak expression after 12 days of MycERTAM activation. β cells in hyperplastic islets of bax–/– pIns-MycERTAM mice maintained Bak expression (compare Figs. 4A and 1B), confirming that β cells in bax–/– pIns-MycERTAM islets fail to undergo apoptosis upon MycERTAM activation, despite the continued presence of Bak. Of note, the few β cells that remained in involuted bak–/– pIns-MycERTAM islets showed clear evidence of Bax expression (Fig. 4B). It nonetheless remained possible that Myc-induced apoptosis, although not completely blocked, was reduced in bak-deficient β cells, but that such partial protection was overwhelmed by 12 days of sustained Myc activation. We therefore also examined the extent of β cell apoptosis in mice in which MycERTAM had been activated for only 32 h. Once again, we discerned no suppression of apoptosis in animals lacking one or both copies of bak. By contrast, homozygous bax-deficient β cells exhibited complete resistance to Myc-induced apoptosis. Again, even a single copy of bax was enough to confer complete sensitivity to Myc-induced apoptosis in the absence of bak (Fig. 5). Proliferative rates upon activation of c-MycERTAM were not affected by Bax and Bak status, and the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was ∼4% in all cases where the pIns-MycERTAM transgene product had been activated (data not shown). Sustained Activation of Myc in the Absence of Bax, but Not Bak, Leads to Rapid Onset of β Cell Tumorigenesis—As described previously, sustained activation of MycERTAM in β cells co-expressing Bcl-xL leads to synchronous and progressive β cell expansion that is accompanied by lock-step co-expansion of the adjacent endothelial compartment (angiogenesis) together with local invasion of surrounding exocrine pancreatic tissue (14Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, the affected β cells undergo partial loss of differentiation, down-regulate surface E-cadherin, and lose the intimate cell-cell contacts that characterize the normal islet. The rapidity and synchrony with which such neoplastic attributes arise indicate that these disparate pleiotropic changes are all instructed by the action of Myc, consistent with the normal physiological role of Myc as a coordinator of cell and tissue expansion and reorganization. Importantly, however, we previously demonstrated that these diverse oncogenic actions of Myc are manifest only when apoptosis is suppressed by co-expression of Bcl-xL, which permits Myc-expressing cells to survive and thereby exert their neoplastic influence on neighboring cells and stroma. To determine whether the absence of Bax, but not Bak, confers a similar capacity on Myc to drive the formation of complex tumors, we examined the morphology, architecture, and dynamics of β cell hyperplasias arising from the activation of MycERTAM in β cells of bax-deficient mice and compared it to that in equivalently treated pIns-MycERTAM mice co-expressing Bcl-xL in their β cells (pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of hyperplastic islets in bax–/– mice in which MycERTAM had been activated for 12 days showed β cells to have enlarged nuclei containing dark chromatin, exactly as in analogously treated pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL animals (Fig. 6A, right panels). Multiple mitotic figures could be found in these islets. Systemic BrdUrd labeling (3.5 h intraperitoneal bolus prior to sacrifice) indicated that β cells remain in cycle after 12 days sustained Myc activity, exactly as in pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL mice. Indeed, even the proportions of BrdUrd-positive cells are similar in islets from each of these two backgrounds. In contrast, no BrdUrd-positive cells were visible in islets of pIns-MycERTAM transgenic mice in which MycERTAM had never been activated (Fig. 6A, left panels), irrespective of their Bax or Bcl-xL status. β cells in bax–/–;bak+/+ pIns-MycERTAM mice showed dense insulin staining before MycERTAM activation. However, after 12 days of sustained Myc activity, insulin staining appeared patchy, and the mice exhibited acute diabetes, indicative of a lack of circulating insulin. Thus, as with pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL mice, even though β cell numbers progressively increased, the dominant dedifferentiating influence of Myc was sufficient to curtail insulin production. By 12 days of Myc activation, bax–/–;bak+/+ pIns-MycERTAM islets also exhibited invasive intrusions into the exocrine tissue, identical to those in pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL mice. Finally, Myc-induced β cell hyperplasias in bax–/–;bak+/+ pIns-MycERTAM mice were highly vascularized as compared with non-tumorigenic islets from the same genetic background that were treated with the vehicle control rather than tamoxifen (Fig. 6B). This is consistent with earlier observations in pIns-MycERTAM; RIP7-Bcl-xL mice that Myc is potently angiogenic. Thus, by multiple independent parameters, Myc-induced tumors arising in bax-deficient animals resemble those in pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL mice in being dedifferentiated, invasive, and angiogenic. We conclude that loss of bax, but not bak, is sufficient not only to suppress Myc-induced apoptosis in vivo but also to unfetter the full oncogenic potential of Myc. Previous in vitro studies have shown that Myc-dependent apoptosis in serum-deprived fibroblasts is dependent upon the expression of Bax but not Bak (16Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Mitchell K.O. Ricci M.S. Miyashita T. Dicker D.T. Jin Z. Reed J.C. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6318-6325PubMed Google Scholar). Our data confirm for the first time that the specific relationship between Myc and Bax holds in other cell types in a physiological setting in vivo. Of note, Myc does not induce expression of the bax gene but rather appears to trigger activation of the Bax protein (16Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, its peculiarly private relationship with Bax implies the existence of some Bax-specific intermediate downstream of Myc, most likely a member of the BH3 family. Recently, we 3A. E. Hunt, A. J. Finch, B. Griffiths, L. Brown-Swigart, and G. I. Evan, submitted for publication. and others (18Egle A. Harris A.W. Bouillet P. Cory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6164-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) have identified Bim as a potential mediator of Myc-dependent activation of the mitochondrial pathway, which is intriguing given the fact that Bim is reported to possess a greater affinity for Bax versus Bak (19Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, studies show that Bim can still interact with Bak, and consistent with this, we showed earlier that Bak could restore Myc-induced apoptosis in bax-deficient fibroblasts if ectopically overexpressed at sufficiently elevated levels (16Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that the private relationship between Myc and Bax so evident in physiological circumstances is, at the molecular level, relative rather than absolute. Indeed, bax;bim (but not bak;bim) double knock-out mice have impaired developmental apoptosis in the interdigital space (20Hutcheson J. Scatizzi J.C. Bickel E. Brown N.J. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Perlman H. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1949-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), similar to that observed in the bax;bak double knock-out mouse, whereas the bax single knock-out does not. This suggests that Bim is capable of efficiently triggering apoptosis through Bak when Bax is absent, at least in this specific developmental instance. Another recent study showed that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xS selectively induces apoptosis through Bak and not Bax (21Lindenboim L. Kringel S. Braun T. Borner C. Stein R. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, evidence is mounting that the various anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL family selectively target different pro-apoptotic members (22Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 23Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), indicating that the ability of any given trigger to activate Bax or Bak will be contingent upon the complement of anti-apoptotic proteins expressed in that cell type. In summary, all of these studies strengthen the notion that the roles of Bax and Bak are not fully interchangeable in the mediation of apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that, by blocking Myc-dependent apoptosis, bax inactivation is sufficient to expose the diverse oncogenic potential of Myc, driving the synchronous progression of angiogenic, invasive β cell carcinomas. This is consistent with the established notion that apoptosis is the principal intrinsic mechanism limiting Myc-induced tumorigenesis (24Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Recently, however, it was reported that although loss of Bax inhibits apoptosis in a classical, constitutive Myc-transgenic mouse model for mammary tumorigenesis (25Jamerson M.H. Johnson M.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Furth P.A. Dickson R.B. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), paradoxically such suppression of apoptosis did not appreciably promote Myc-induced tumorigenesis. This inconsistency may indicate that apoptosis suppresses tumorigenesis to different extents in differing tissues. On the other hand, in classical, constitutive transgenic tumor models, it is extremely difficult to dissect out the Myc-dependent component of apoptosis from that induced by any of the many other insults sustained by established tumors (e.g. DNA damage, hypoxia, and survival factor deprivation), any or all of which may contribute to limiting tumorigenesis. Because most of such triggers can route through either Bax or Bak (3Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 6Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), they would not be blocked appreciably by the inactivation of Bax alone. By contrast, acutely switchable Myc oncogenesis models have the advantage of allowing direct inspection, in real time, of Myc-induced apoptosis in vivo and its influence on tumorigenesis. On the other hand, our model is limited by the fact that tamoxifen must be administered daily by intraperitoneal injection to keep the transgene active. As with all mouse models, we also realize that our model has its limitations, and although the rapid switchability of our model allows us to inspect the roles of Bax and Bak in the prevention of early tumor formation in a unique way, the need for daily tamoxifen injections to keep MycERTAM active precludes examination of long term tumor maintenance. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that loss of Bak could play a role in the maintenance of islet tumors that form in the bax–/–;bak+/+ pIns-MycERTAM mice at a later stage. It remains to be seen whether Bak, in the absence of Bax, can mediate apoptosis in pancreatic β cells when it is induced by triggers other than Myc. It is known that β cell attrition can be induced in bax–/–;bak+/+ mice, for example, by treatment with streptozotocin (26Chi M.M. Pingsterhaus J. Carayannopoulos M. Moley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40252-40257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), although it has not been determined whether Bak is required to mediate this death. Ultimately, defining precisely when, and in response to what signals, Bax and Bak differentially contribute to apoptosis in tumors will be important in establishing if and when each can function to limit the emergence of tumors in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2144304328,"The structure and biochemical function of the hot dog-fold thioesterase PaaI operative in the aerobic phenylacetate degradation pathway are examined. PaaI showed modest activity with phenylacetyl-coenzyme A, suggestive of a role in coenzyme A release from this pathway intermediate in the event of limiting downstream pathway enzymes. Minimal activity was observed with aliphatic acyl-coenzyme A thioesters, which ruled out PaaI function in the lower phenylacetate pathway. PaaI was most active with ring-hydroxylated phenylacetyl-coenzyme A thioesters. The x-ray crystal structure of the Escherichia coli thioesterase is reported and analyzed to define the structural basis of substrate recognition and catalysis. The contributions of catalytic and substrate binding residues, thus, identified were examined through steady-state kinetic analysis of site-directed mutant proteins.

Phenylacetate derives primarily from phenylalanine, but it is also formed in degradation pathways that target a variety of environmental aromatics of natural and synthetic origin and, thus, is the central element of an important catabolon (20Olivera E.R.

PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1991Google Scholar) using genomic DNA prepared from A. evansii DSM 6898 (DSMZ) and E. coli strain ATCC 11105 (Manassas, VA) as templates, respectively, commercial oligonucleotides as primers, and Pfu Turbo as the DNA polymerase. The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII and then purified by agarose gel chromatography before T4 DNA ligase catalyzed the ligation to pET-23b (+) vector (Novagen) digested by the NdeI and HindIII. The resulting clones named EcWT-PaaI/pET-23b and AeWT-PaaI/pET-23b were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutagenesis was carried out using a PCR-based strategy with commercial primers and the WT-PaaI/pET-23b (+) plasmid serving as template. The purified PCR products were used to transform to E. coli JM109-competent cells (Stratagene). Mutant genes were verified by DNA sequencing. For protein production PaaI/pET-23b transformants of E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown aerobically at 28 °C in LB media containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin for ∼10 h (A600 1.0) then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min), suspended in 100 ml of 50 mm K+Hepes, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT (pH 7.5, 0 °C) and passed through a French press at 1200 p.s.i. twice before centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 45 × 3.5-cm DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted at 4 °C with a 2-liter gradient of 0-0.5 m KCl in 50 mm K+Hepes, 1 mm DTT (pH 7.5). The thioesterase-containing fractions (eluted at ∼ 0.3 m KCl) were combined and then precipitated with ammonium sulfate (40-60% cut for A. evansii and 0-40% cut for E. coli PaaI). The A. evansii PaaI was dissolved in 2 ml of 10 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.5) buffer with 0.15 m KCl and 1 mm DTT, and E. coli PaaI was dissolved in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1) buffer with 0.05 m KCl and 1 mm DTT. The protein solution (1 ml) was applied to a 100 × 2-cm Sephacryl S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted at 4 °C with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. The thioesterase-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated with a 10-kDa Macrosep centricon (Pall Filtron). The activity of the A. evansii PaaI was stable for storage in 10 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.5) buffer or in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1) containing 10 mm KCl at -80 °C for several months. The E. coli PaaI could be stored in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1) at 0 °C (not frozen) ice for several weeks without significant loss of activity. The yields of homogeneous (based on SDS-PAGE analysis) A. evansii PaaI proteins in mg/g of wet cells were WT (11Haggblom M.M. FEMS Microbiol.

Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography (Hiload 60 × 16-cm Amersham Biosciences Superdex S-200) was used to determine whether the A. evansii PaaI mutant proteins were contaminated with E. coli PaaI. A solution of 10 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m KCl and 1 mm DTT was used to elute the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The retention time of the E. coli PaaI was 52.3 min versus 47.0 min for the A. evansii PaaI. The activities of the A. evansii PaaI mutants were measured before and after chromatography and found to be identical, thereby demonstrating that the protein purification protocol described above removes E. coli PaaI from the A. evansii PaaI. Molecular Size Determination—The molecular mass was calculated from the amino acid composition, derived from the gene sequence, by using the EXPASY Molecular Biology Server program Compute pI/Mw. The molecular mass was measured by ESI mass spectrometry and by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel and 18% separating gel). The mass of native PaaI was estimated by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column chromatography carried out as described in the previous section. Commercial protein molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used to generate a plot of log Mr versus elution volume from the column. Kinetic Assays—Steady-state kinetic methods were used to determine the kcat and Km for wild-type and mutant PaaI as a function of substrate screening, reaction solution pH, or presence of an inhibitor. The details of each experimental measurement are provided in the supplemental material. The A. evansii PaaI reactions were typically monitored at 25 °C by using a 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-based assay in which the absorbance of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate at 412 nm (Δϵ = 13.6 mm-1·cm-1) was measured. For E. coli PaaI, which is rapidly inactivated by 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid under assay conditions, a continuous spectrophotometric assay was employed. Accordingly, the decrease in solution absorbance at 236 nm was monitored for the reaction mixtures of 4-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA (Δϵ = 4.2 mm-1·cm-1), 3-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA (Δϵ = 3.6 mm-1·cm-1), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA (Δϵ = 3.2 mm-1·cm-1). For the phenylacetyl-CoA substrates, a fixed-time, reversed-phase HPLC-based assay was used. The initial velocity data, measured as a function of substrate concentration, were analyzed using Equation 1 V=Vmax[S]/([S]+Km)(Eq. 1) where V is initial velocity, Vmax is maximum velocity, [S] is substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant. The kcat was calculated from Vmax/[E], where [E] is the total enzyme concentration (determined using the Bradford method (62Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar)). The inhibition constant Ki was obtained by fitting the initial rates to Equation 2 V=Vmax[S]/[Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]](Eq. 2) where [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor, and Ki is the inhibition constant. The log kcat and log(kcat/Km) values obtained from the pH rate profile analysis were fitted using Equation 3 logY=log(C/(1+[H]/Ka+Kb/[H]))(Eq. 3) where Y is kcat or kcat/Km,[H] is the hydrogen ion concentration, C is the pH independent value of kcat or kcat/Km, Ka is the acid dissociation constant, and Kb is the base dissociation constant. Data analysis was carried out using the computer program KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics). The reported error was computed for the data fitting. Recombinant A. evansii and E. coli PaaI Characterization—The theoretical molecular weights of the A. evansii (154 amino acids) and E. coli (140 amino acids) PaaIs are 16,550 and 14,851, respectively, which compare with the ESI mass spectrometric determined molecular weights of 16,419 and 14,720. Both recombinant proteins have, thus, lost the N-terminal Met (-131 Da) by post-translational modification. The A. evansii and E. coli PaaIs migrate on SDS-PAGE gels as 15- and 14-kDa proteins, whereas the native molecular masses determined by gel filtration chromatography correspond to 67 and 58 kDa. Both PaaIs are, therefore, homotetramers. The pH rate profiles of PaaI-catalyzed 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA hydrolysis (identified as the most active substrate; see below) were measured using initial-velocity techniques (Fig. 2). Both PaaIs are stable at pH 6-10 (Fig. 2, insets) and most active at pH 6-9. The bell-shaped curves were fitted to define the apparent pKa values for ionization of essential residues in the enzyme-substrate complex (log(kcat)) and in the uncomplexed enzyme and substrate"
https://openalex.org/W2013809147,"Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cervical cancer in humans. The antiapoptotic viral E6 gene has been identified as a key factor for maintaining the viability of HPV-positive cancer cells. Although E6 has the potential to modulate many apoptosis regulators, the crucial apoptotic pathway blocked by endogenous E6 in cervical cancer cells remained unknown. Using RNA interference (RNAi), here, we show that targeted inhibition of E6 expression in cervical cancer cells leads to the transcriptional stimulation of the PUMA promoter, in a p53-dependent manner. This is linked to the activation and translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and activation of caspase-3, in a PUMA-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of Bax expression by RNAi efficiently reverts the apoptotic phenotype, which results from inhibition of E6 expression. Thus, interference with the p53/PUMA/Bax cascade is crucial for the antiapoptotic function of the viral E6 oncogene in HPV-positive cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2101037420,"Previous studies have indicated that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) can functionally interact with integrins thereby modulating integrin activity. We have previously demonstrated that treatment of fibroblasts with the uPAR ligand, P25, results in an increase in the activation of the β1 integrin and a 35-fold increase in fibronectin matrix assembly (Monaghan, E., Gueorguiev, V., Wilkins-Port, C., and McKeown-Longo, P. J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 1400-1407). Experiments were conducted to address the mechanism of uPAR regulation of matrix assembly. Treatment of fibroblasts with P25 led to an increase in the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a colocalization of activated EGFR with β1 integrins in cell matrix contacts. The effects of P25 on matrix assembly and β1 integrin activation were inhibited by pretreatment with EGFR or Src kinase inhibitors, suggesting a role for both Src and EGFR in integrin activation by uPAR. Phosphorylation of EGFR in response to P25 occurred on Tyr-845, an Src-dependent phosphorylation site and was inhibited by PP2, the Src kinase inhibitor, consistent with Src kinase lying upstream of EGFR and integrin activation. Cells null for Src kinases also showed a loss of P25-induced matrix assembly, integrin activation, and EGFR phosphorylation. These P25-induced effects were restored following Src re-expression. The effects of P25 were specific for uPAR as enhanced matrix assembly by P25 was not seen in uPAR-/- cells, but was restored upon uPAR re-expression. These data provide evidence for a novel pathway of fibronectin matrix assembly through the uPAR-dependent sequential activation of Src kinase, EGFR, and β1 integrin.

These data provide evidence for a novel pathway of fibronectin matrix assembly through the uPAR-dependent sequential activation of Src kinase, EGFR, and β1 integrin. Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein that can be found in two forms; the soluble, protomeric molecule found in blood plasma, and the insoluble polymer, which forms an essential component of the extracellular matrix. Assembly of the fibronectin matrix is a dynamic process requiring the coordinate regulation of integrin receptor function, cytoskeletal organization, and intermolecular homophilic binding events between assembling fibronectin protomers (1Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Fibronectin matrix, through its interaction with cell-surface integrin receptors, intersects with intracellular signaling cascades important in the regulation of cell spreading, cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle, and cell survival (2Assoian R.K.

More recent studies have indicated that ongoing fibronectin polymerization plays an important role in the regulation of collagen deposition and in the stability of cell extracellular matrix contacts (15Velling T.

In subsequent steps, integrin-dependent unmasking of homophilic binding sites promotes polymerization of fibronectin into an insoluble fibrillar matrix (19Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J.

Fibronectin matrix assembly is primarily regulated by the α5β1 integrin receptor for fibronectin. α5β1 is thought to exist in multiple activation states, which likely impact its ability to support fibronectin fibrillogenesis (21Garcia A.J.

Among them, peptide P25, identified by phage display, has been shown to bind uPAR directly and affect the functioning of the α5β1 integrin (38Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Integrins have also been reported to complex with growth factor receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (39Cabodi S. Moro L. Bergatto E. Erba E.B. Di Stefano P. Turco E. Tarone G. Defilippi P. Biochem. Soc. Transact. 2004; 32: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Integrin adhesion can trigger the Src-dependent but ligand-independent activation of EGFR resulting in the activation of ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase and the promotion of cell growth and survival (39Cabodi S.

These complexes may also include uPAR, because recent studies have proposed a tripartite complex of uPAR/EGFR-α5β1, which mediates uPA-initiated signal transduction leading to ERK activation (41Liu D.

Previously we have shown that treatment of monolayers of human dermal fibroblasts with the uPAR ligand, P25, results in increased formation of fibronectin matrix through a pathway involving β1 integrin activation (43Monaghan E. Gueorguiev V. Wilkins-Port C. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1400-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we address the molecular mechanism by which uPAR regulates fibronectin matrix assembly. Our results show that ligation of uPAR with P25 causes a Src-dependent transactivation of the EGFR and promotes the formation of EGFR-β1 complexes. Both Src kinase and EGFR are required for the uPAR-dependent increase in β1 integrin activation and fibronectin matrix assembly. These data support a model whereby uPAR ligation up-regulates fibronectin matrix assembly through a novel pathway involving sequential activation of Src kinase, EGFR, and β1 integrin.

The uPAR+/+ and uPAR-/- MEF cell lines, described previously (44Ma Z. Thomas K.S. Webb D.J. Moravec R.S.A.M. Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were provided by Dr. Steve Gonias (University of California-San Diego). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). A1-F cells were used at passages 6-12, and unless otherwise noted experiments were performed on monolayer cultures. Transient Transfection of uPAR in MEFs—To re-express uPAR in uPAR-/- MEFs, cells were grown to confluency in 6-well plates and transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA 3.1+ plasmid containing the full-length cDNA for human uPAR (pcDNA-uPAR, a gift of Dr. Harold Chapman, University of California-San Francisco) and 12 μl of Lipofectamine, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiencies were >60%, as determined by counting green fluorescent cells in preparations transfected with pEGFP plasmid (Clontech). MEFs were transfected for 24 h before assays were performed. Purification and Derivatization of Proteins—Human plasma fibronectin was purified from a fibronectin and fibrinogen-rich by product of Factor VIII production by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (45McKeown-Longo P.J. Etzler C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and further purified by affinity chromatography with gelatin-agarose and heparin-agarose (46Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin was generated by limited digestion of intact fibronectin with cathepsin D followed by gelatin affinity chromatography as described previously (45McKeown-Longo P.J. Etzler C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purified plasma fibronectin (400 μg) and the 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin (100 μg) were iodinated with 1 mCi of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (47McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Iodinated proteins were mixed with bovine albumin, 1 mg/ml, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen at -80 °C until used. Matrix Incorporation Assays—The 125I-fibronectin assembly into detergent-insoluble matrix was determined as previously described (47McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with 125I-fibronectin (1 μg/ml, 1 × 106 cpm/ml) in DMEM at 37 °C in the presence of either P25 or S25. Incubation times and peptide doses and/or inhibitors are as designated in the figure legends. After incubation, cells were rinsed three times in PBS, and the detergent-insoluble extracellular matrix was isolated by extraction of cell layers in 1% deoxycholate. Deoxycholate extractions were done in a 20 mm Tris (pH 8.8) buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm iodoacetic acid. Cell layers were scraped into 1% deoxycholate, and deoxycholate-insoluble matrix was recovered by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 30 min. Radioactivity associated with the pellet was measured by gamma scintillation. 70-kDa Fragment Binding Assays—Cell layers were preincubated with peptides and inhibitors as specified in the figure legends prior to the addition of the 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment (100 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. Following incubation with the 70-kDa fibronectin fragment, cell layers were washed three times with PBS, solubilized in 1 n NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by gamma scintillation. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess (50 μg/ml) unlabeled protein. Receptor Activation Assays—A1-F cells were grown to confluence in 48-well plates and treated with peptides and/or inhibitors as designated in the figure legends. To detect activated β1 integrins, cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml monoclonal antibody, HUTS-4 or 9EG7, for 1 h. To detect activated EGFR, cells were incubated with 400 ng/ml monoclonal antibody 74 for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Bound antibody was detected by incubating cells for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (for HUTS-4 or monoclonal antibody 74) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (9EG7). Cell layers were washed five times with PBS and incubated with substrate (0.1 m citrate buffer, 0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine, 1 μg/ml 30% hydrogen peroxide, pH 5). The color was allowed to develop, and the reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 n sulfuric acid prior to measuring the optical density at A490. Measurements were corrected for light scattering by subtracting the optical density obtained at A650. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—A1-F cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin, and allowed to adhere and spread for 2 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then treated with 50 μm P25, S25, or 100 ng/ml EGF for 1 h, washed with PBS, fixed for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.3% Triton, and blocked for 30 min in 2% bovine serum albumin. To visualize activated EGFR, cells were stained with monoclonal antibody 74, followed by goat anti-mouse conjugated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 594. Cells were then costained for β1 integrin with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody directed against β1 integrin. Fluorophores were visualized using an Olympus BX-60 microscope equipped with a cooled charge capture device sensi-camera. Images were acquired using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Inc., Denver, CO) and processed using Adobe Photoshop. Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cell monolayers were serum-starved overnight before stimulation with peptides or growth factor. Treatment doses and times are provided in the figure legends. For immunoprecipitation, cells were extracted on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors). After preclearing with protein A-agarose beads, lysates were incubated with antibodies to EGFR (BIOSOURCE) for 3 h at 4°C. After washing three times, the beads were resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. For whole cell lysate analysis, cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in sample buffer. Lysates were electrophoresed into SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell Bioscience) and processed for Western analysis using the antibodies described in the figure legends. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then stripped and reprobed with an antibody against total protein to verify equal loading. Densitometric analysis was performed using a Personal Densitometer SI and Image Quant program (Molecular Dynamics). We have previously shown that incubation of monolayers of human dermal fibroblasts with the uPAR ligand, P25, results in a substantial increase in the rate of fibronectin matrix assembly (43Monaghan E. Gueorguiev V. Wilkins-Port C. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1400-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the EGFR may participate in the transduction of uPAR-dependent signaling pathways (41Liu D. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 42Guerrero J. Santibanez J.F. Gonzalez A. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To investigate a role for EGFR in regulation of matrix assembly by uPAR, the EGFR kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, was used to inhibit EGFR activity. Monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts were incubated with increasing doses of AG1478 for 1 h before treatment with the uPAR ligand, P25, or the scrambled control peptide, S25. After 1 h of incubation with the peptide, matrix assembly site expression was measured using the 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin. Treatment with P25 caused an 8- to 9-fold increase in the binding of the 125I-70 kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin to fibroblast monolayers (Fig. 1A). The control peptide, S25 had no effect on 70-kDa fragment binding. In the presence of increasing concentrations of the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478, there was a dose-dependent decrease in P25-mediated 70-kDa fragment binding. The binding of fibronectin to matrix assembly sites is followed by intermolecular homophilic binding events, which render the fibronectin detergent-insoluble (19Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine if EGFR is required for the P25-mediated detergent-insoluble matrix formation, cells were preincubated with increasing doses of AG1478. After a 1-h treatment with AG1478, cells were incubated with 125I-fibronectin for 6 h in the presence of 50 μm P25 or S25. Detergent-insoluble extracellular matrix was then isolated by deoxycholate extraction. Fig. 1B shows a 35-fold increase in detergent-insoluble matrix in the presence of P25 and a dose-dependent decrease in P25-enhanced matrix assembly in the presence of AG1478. The scrambled peptide, S25, had no effect on the levels of fibronectin matrix. Similar results were seen using PD168393, another inhibitor of EGFR kinase activity. Treatment of cells with PD168393 prior to addition of P25 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the P25-mediated increase in both 70-kDa fragment binding and fibronectin matrix incorporation (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that EGFR activity is required for the P25-mediated increase in fibronectin matrix assembly. In the absence of P25, neither AG1478 nor PD16893 had any effect on incorporation of fibronectin into matrix suggesting that EGFR does not participate in the regulation of basal levels of fibronectin matrix assembly. In response to growth factor treatment, EGFR undergoes a series of tyrosine-phosphorylation events that lead to its activation. To evaluate whether P25 was causing activation of EGFR, an ELISA assay was performed on P25-treated fibroblast monolayers using a monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody 74) that recognizes the activated form of EGFR. As shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of P25 to cells resulted in increase in monoclonal antibody 74 binding consistent with an increase in EGFR activation. EGF, the growth factor ligand of EGFR, was used as a positive control for EGFR activation. Our earlier studies have shown that the P25-mediated increase in the expression of 70-kDa binding sites and in the assembly of fibronectin into matrix is regulated by the α5β1 integrin receptor for fibronectin (43Monaghan E. Gueorguiev V. Wilkins-Port C. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1400-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that uPAR, β1, and EGFR may form physical as well as functional complexes (41Liu D. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To determine whether P25 was effecting the formation of β1-EGFR complexes, β1 and EGFR were localized by indirect immunofluorescence. Following a 1-h treatment with P25, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and costained with antibodies to the β1 integrin (Fig. 2B, panels A-C) and to the activated EGFR (Fig. 2B, panels D-F). In the presence of control peptide S25, β1 staining was localized to adhesion sites (Fig. 2B, panel A), and there was little staining of activated EGFR (Fig. 2B, panel D). In the presence of P25, active EGFR was localized in adhesion sites (Fig. 2B, panels C and F). Activation of EGFR by its ligand, EGF, resulted in increased staining of activated EGFR, however, EGFR localization remained diffuse over the cell surface (Fig. 2B, panel E). Merged images are shown in Fig. 2B (panels G-I), and colocalization of integrin and EGFR is shown in yellow. Colocalization of activated EGFR with β1 integrin is observed after P25 (panel I) treatment, but no colocalization is seen in the S25- or EGF-treated cells. Treatment of the cells with AG1478 prevents the P25-mediated colocalization of the EGFR and β1 integrin (data not shown) suggesting that the kinase activity of the EGFR is required for its interaction with the β1 integrin. These results indicate that activation of EGFR by P25 but not by EGF, results in the redistribution of EGFR into β1-containing focal adhesions. β1-EGFR complex formation was also assessed by coimmunoprecipitation. Lysates from cells treated with S25, P25, or EGF were immunoprecipitated with an EGFR antibody and analyzed for β1 integrin by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2C, the cells treated with P"

In addition, p63 has also been shown to play a role in cancer development through the differential regulation of genes with tumor suppressor function and genes involved in metastasis. In order to understand the role of p63 in cancer and development, genes that are specifically regulated by p63 but not p53 were identified. In this study, we provide evidence that p63γ specifically upregulates vitamin D Receptor (VDR). In contrast, p53 does not appear to be involved in upregulation of VDR expression. Additionally, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring p63 missense mutant, p63γ (R279H) and p14ARF, both act in a dominant negative manner to inhibit p63γ-mediated upregulation of VDR. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that p63 directly binds to the VDR promoter in vivo. Our findings clearly demonstrate that VDR is a direct target of p63 and suggests that p63 may play a role in cancer and differentiation through modulation of the VDR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2127443571,"We established previously that α-synuclein displayed a protective anti-apoptotic phenotype in neurons, mainly by down-regulating p53-dependent caspase-3 activation (Alves da Costa, C., Ancolio, K., and Checler, F. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 24065-24069; Alves da Costa, C., Paitel, E., Vincent, B., and Checler, F. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 50980-50984). This function was abolished by Parkinson disease-linked pathogenic mutations and by the dopaminergic toxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6OH-DOPA) (Alves da Costa, C., Paitel, E., Vincent, B., and Checler, F. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 50980-50984). However, the mechanisms by which 6OH-DOPA interfered with α-synuclein function remained unclear. Here we showed that 6OH-DOPA prevents α-synuclein-mediated anti-apoptotic function by altering its degradation. Thus, 6OH-DOPA treatment of TSM1 neurons and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells enhances endogenous α-synuclein-like immunoreactivity and inhibits the catabolism of endogenous and recombinant α-synucleins by purified 20 S proteasome. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 6OH-DOPA directly inhibits endogenous proteasomal activity in TSM1 and SH-SY5Y cells and also blocks purified proteasome activity in vitro. This inhibitory effect can be prevented by the anti-oxidant phenyl-N-butylnitrone. We also established that 6OH-DOPA triggers the aggregation of recombinant α-synuclein in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that 6OH-DOPA abolishes α-synuclein anti-apoptotic phenotype by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, thereby increasing its intracellular concentration and potential propensity to aggregation, the latter phenomenon being directly exacerbated by 6OH-DOPA itself. Interestingly, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), another toxin inducer of Parkinson disease-like pathology, does not affect α-synuclein protective function and fails to trigger aggregation of recombinant α-synuclein. Furthermore, MPP+ does not alter cellular proteasomal activity, and only high concentrations of the toxin affect purified 20 S proteasome by a mechanism that remains insensitive to phenyl-N-butylnitrone. The drastically distinct effects of 6OH-DOPA and MPP+ on α-synuclein function are discussed with respect to Parkinson disease pathology and animal models mimicking this pathology.

This invalidating disease is characterized, at an immunohistochemical level, by the selective destruction of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the replacement treatment consisting of the administration of the dopamine precursor 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine has proven useful to temporarily stabilize patients, it still remains a symptomatic treatment, and the exact etiology of the disease remains a crucial and still unsolved issue.Parkinson disease cases are generally of sporadic origin, but a few cases have a genetic etiology. These familial PD cases are typically of earlier onset and more aggressive and can be caused by either autosomal dominant or recessive inherited mutations (3Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3966) Google Scholar). The identification of the protein candidates that, when mutated, contribute to familial PD and the delineation of their associated physiological or PD-related altered function will allow a better understanding of the etiology of the disease.The α-synuclein (α-syn) protein (4Uéda K.

The α-syn protein is, together with ubiquitin, the main component of Lewy bodies (12Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5953) Google Scholar), the intracellular inclusions that accumulate as the disease progresses (13Lotharius J. Brundin P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 1-11Crossref Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The overexpression of wild-type or mutant α-syn triggers dopaminergic neuronal loss accompanied by exacerbated α-syn aggregation in transgenic animals (14Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Conversely, α-syn depletion leads to nigrostriatal dysfunction (15Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.-H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M.G. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M.

Therefore, both the overexpression or deletion of α-syn leads to PD-like functional and morphological alterations. These apparently paradoxical observations could be reconciled by assuming that α-syn has a physiological function that would be abrogated in knock-out mice but also blocked by a concentration-dependent aggregation process associated with overexpression in transgenic animals.We have reported previously on the ability of α-syn to protect TSM1 neurons and HEK293 cells from staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation (1Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).

The abrogation of the α-syn anti-apoptotic phenotype by both genetic and biochemical defects firmly suggested that this protective effect reflected a physiological function of the protein, correlating well with the nigrostriatal alteration observed in knock-out mice lacking α-syn (15Abeliovich A.

Furthermore, whether the modulation of α-syn function was selectively altered by 6OH-DOPA and not by other natural or synthetic neurochemicals affecting dopaminergic neurons remained to be established. In this study we demonstrate that 6OH-DOPA, but not 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), interferes with the α-syn anti-apoptotic phenotype by both inhibiting its proteasomal degradation and promoting its aggregation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cells—Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-aminomethylcoumarin, staurosporine, lactacystin, stabilized 6OH-DOPA, phenyl-N-butylnitrone (PBN), and MPP+ were all purchased from Sigma.

Leck S.-L. Tew D.J. Williamson N.A. Smith D.P. Galatis D. Sharples R.A. Curtain C.C. Ali F.E. Cherny D. Culvenor J.G. Bottomley S.P. Masters C.L. Barnham K.J. Hill A.F. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1377-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The α-syn was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and then lyophilized using a freeze dryer. Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.Purification of the 20 S Proteasome and Fluorimetric Assay—Purified bovine pituitary 20 S proteasome (specific activity of about 6 mmol of p-nitroaniline released per h/mg from Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-p-nitroaniline) was obtained as described (18Wilk S. Chen W.-E. Dunn B. Current Protocols in Protein Science. Unit 21. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 6.1-6.9Google Scholar). Proteasomal activity was measured as follows. Briefly, Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-aminomethylcoumarin (100 μm) was incubated with 2 μl of the purified enzyme for several time intervals at 37 °C, in a final volume of 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA), in the absence or in the presence of lactacystin (1μm). Fluorescence was recorded at 396 and 460 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, as described previously (19Checler F. Nagatsu T. Parvez H. Naoi M. Parvez S. Methods in Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides Research, Part 2. 11. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 375-418Google Scholar).Endogenous Proteasomal Activity—TSM1 cells were cultivated in 6-well plates until 70-80% of confluence and then treated for 8 h at 37 °C with various concentrations of 6OH-DOPA (phosphate-buffered saline) or MPP+ (dissolved in water). The cells were then harvested, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and then proteasome activity (50 μg of the cleared supernatant) was fluorimetrically recorded as above.Degradation of Endogenous and Recombinant α-Syn by Purified 20 S Proteasome—TSM1 neurons overexpressing α-syn were cultivated in 6-well plates until confluent, harvested, centrifuged, and lysed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fifty μg of the cell homogenates were incubated for 3 or 6 h with 15 μl of 20 S purified proteasome activity in the absence or in the presence of 0.2 mm 6OH-DOPA. Endogenous α-syn degradation was then monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis as described below. Recombinant α-syn (1 μg) was incubated for various times at 37 °C with purified 20 S proteasome (10 μl) and then α-syn degradation was monitored as above.Western Blot Analysis—Proteins (50 μg) were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels then wet-transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with nonfat milk and incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: anti-α-syn (human polyclonal antibody; Affiniti Laboratory), anti-β-tubulin (human/mouse monoclonal antibody; Sigma), and anti-active caspase-3 (human/mouse polyclonal antibody; R & D Systems). Immunological complexes were revealed with the appropriate secondary peroxidasecoupled antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection as described (Roche Applied Science). Note that when aggregates of α-syn were monitored, 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were performed that allow us to follow high molecular weight α-syn-like immunoreactivity but do not allow us to detect single monomers that are eluted out of the gel.XTT and Caspase Assays—TSM1 neurons were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in 96-well plates in a final volume of 100 μl per well and were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence and absence of various concentrations of MPP+. Sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate (XTT)-metabolizing activity was determined as described previously (1Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity was monitored as described (20Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).LDH Assay—TSM1 neurons were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in 6-well plates and incubated 8 h at 37 °C in the presence and absence of either 0.2 mm 6OH-DOPA or 5.0 mm MPP+. After treatments, 40 μl of culture medium was analyzed by means of CytoTox-One™ homogeneous membrane integrity assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's conditions.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with PRISM software (Graphpad Software, San Diego), by using the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests for one-way analysis of variance.RESULTS6OH-DOPA but Not MPP+ Abolishes the α-Syn Anti-apoptotic Phenotype—We previously established that wild-type α-syn drastically reduced the staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-3 in HEK293 cells and in TSM1 neurons (1Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This anti-apoptotic phenotype was abolished by the dopamine toxin 6OH-DOPA (2Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In mock-transfected TSM1 neurons, the pro-apoptotic effector staurosporine (1 μm) drastically enhances caspase-3 expression, and this effect was strongly inhibited (79% of inhibition) by the overexpression of wild-type α-syn (Fig. 1A). Treatment with 6OH-DOPA (0.2 mm) can also enhance active caspase-3 expression in mock-transfected cells, and this effect is not altered by α-syn overexpression (Fig. 1A). The immunoblotting data were corroborated by direct enzymatic measurements of caspase-3. Thus, α-syn-expressing TSM1 neurons displayed significantly lower caspase-3 activity than mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1, B and C, see Ct lanes). This phenotype was not affected by 0.1 mm of 6OH-DOPA, whereas higher concentrations fully block the α-syn-mediated antiapoptotic phenotype (Fig. 1B). Most interestingly, MPP+ had no effect on activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity in either mock-transfected or α-syn-overexpressing neurons (Fig. 1A). MPP+ only enhanced caspase-3 activity at very high concentrations (i.e. equal or superior to 3 mm; Fig. 1C), but MPP+ only abolished α-syn-induced protective effect at a 5 mm concentration (Fig. 1C).We examined whether MPP+ could modulate the protective effect of α-syn on cellular toxicity. As expected, MPP+ elicited a dose-dependent toxic effect on mock-transfected TSM1 neurons (Fig. 2A). At a low MPP+ concentration (0.1 mm), TSM1 viability measured by XTT assay was reduced by about 50%, although a maximal effect was observed at 1 mm and plateaued at higher concentrations of MPP+ (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, α-syn expression significantly protected TSM1 from MPP+-induced toxicity, except at the highest concentration of MPP+ tested (Fig. 2A, 5 mm). Because high concentrations of MPP+ may have altered the conversion of XTT by a direct inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain, we examined the effect of MPP+ in another cellular toxicity assay, and we compared it to that induced by 6OH-DOPA. Thus, 6OH-DOPA increased toxicity, although a 5 mm concentration of MPP+ did not alter the viability of mock-transfected TSM1 cells (Fig. 2B). As expected, α-syn expression lowered basal cellular toxicity, whereas 6OH-DOPA but not MPP+ abolished this α-syn-mediated protective effect (Fig. 2B). Altogether, the above data confirmed that 6OH-DOPA, but not MPP+, abolished the α-syn-associated protective activity on TSM1 neurons. We therefore attempted to delineate the mechanisms by which 6OH-DOPA specifically altered the α-syn antiapoptotic phenotype.FIGURE 2α-Syn protects TSM1 neurons against MPP+-induced toxicity. A, mocktransfected (black bars) or α-syn-expressing (white bars) TSM1 neurons were treated overnight with the indicated concentrations of MPP+, and then cell viability was monitored by XTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, mock-transfected (black bars) or α-syn-expressing (white bars) TSM1 neurons were treated 8 h with 6OH-DOPA (6OH, 0.2 mm) or MPP+ (5 mm), and then cell viability was monitored by LDH release toxicity assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the means of 2 and 5 independent experiments performed in triplicate and are expressed as percent of control untreated cells taken as 100 percent of cytotoxicity (% released LDH/total LDH) for A and B, respectively. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; NS, not significant; Wt, wild type, All statistical analysis correspond to comparisons versus control except when indicated by horizontal lines or brackets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)6OH-DOPA but Not MPP+ Alters α-Syn-like Immunoreactivity in Neurons and SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells—We have examined whether 6OH-DOPA could modulate α-syn expression in TSM1 neurons and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In TSM1 neurons, 6OH-DOPA drastically enhanced α -syn expression, whereas staurosporine and MPP+ were unable to alter its expression (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, lactacystin, a proteasomal inhibitor (21Fenteany G. Standaert R. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar), also enhanced α-syn immunoreactivity (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, 6OH-DOPA and lactacystin effects were not additive, whereas lactacystin retains its ability to enhance α-syn expression in the presence of MPP+ (Fig. 3A). 6OH-DOPA but not MPP+ also increased α-syn-like immunoreactivity in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3, B and C). The above observations suggested that 6OH-DOPA and lactacystin have the same cellular target that is not affected by MPP+. In this context, because of the rather narrow specificity of lactacystin for the proteasome, the most likely candidate target for 6OH-DOPA would be the proteasome itself. Therefore, we examined whether 6OH-DOPA could directly or indirectly affect the function of endogenous and purified proteasome.FIGURE 36OH-DOPA but not MPP+ alters α-syn-like immunoreactivity in neurons. A, α-syn-expressing TSM1 neurons were pretreated overnight without (-) or with (+) 2 μm lactacystin (Lact) and then treated either with staurosporine (STS, 2 h, 1 μm) or with 6OH-DOPA (6OH, 8 h, 0.2 mm) or MPP+ (8 h, 5 mm). α-Syn immunoreactivity and tubulin (Tub) were monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of cDNA of wild-type Syn by means of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) reactive according to manufacturer's conditions. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 6OH-DOPA (6OH,8 h, 0.2 mm) or MPP+ (8 h, 5 mm). α-Syn immunoreactivity and tubulin were monitored (B and C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars in C represent the means of three independent experiments. *, p <0.05; NS, not significant; Ct, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)6OH-DOPA Inhibits Purified 20 S Proteasome and Endogenous Proteasome in TSM1 and SH-SY5Y Cells—Cellular proteasome refers to a mixture of 20 S, 26 S, and 20 S coupled to various 11 S or 19 S regulatory subunits (22Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10289-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is the most abundant species in the cell and in cell extracts (23Tanahashi N. Murakami Y. Minami Y. Shimbara N. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14336-14445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) because of the extreme lability of the 26 S complex. The latter needs several stabilizing agents such as glycerol, MgCl2, and ATP to retain its activity (24Pereira M.E. Yu B. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This explains why purified proteasome consists mostly of the 20 S counterpart (25Orlowski M. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The purified 20 S proteasome (Fig. 4, A and B) and the TSM1 endogenous proteasomal activity (Fig. 4C) displayed similar susceptibility to lactacystin. Therefore, the mixture of endogenous neuronal proteasome complexes behaved as homogeneous purified 20 S proteasome, indicating that the latter was most likely accounting for the majority of the endogenous proteasome activity in TSM1 neurons. Interestingly, 6OH-DOPA dose-dependently inhibited endogenous TSM1 proteasome activity (Fig. 5A), whereas MPP+ did not inhibit the activity, even at high concentrations (Fig. 5B). The same distinct effects were observed in SH-SY5Y cells where 6OH-DOPA but not MPP+ inhibited endogenous proteasomal activity (Fig. 5C). To confirm the ability of 6OH-DOPA but not MPP+ to inhibit the proteasome, we tested the ability of these compounds to block purified 20 S proteasome. The 6OH-DOPA inhibited the 20 S proteasome in a dose-(Fig. 6A) and time-dependent (Fig. 6B) manner, whereas MPP+ elicited significant inhibitory effect of proteasomal activity only at high concentrations (equal or superior to 3 mm, Fig. 6C).FIGURE 4Kinetics parameters of endogenous and purified 20 S proteasome.

https://openalex.org/W2032415249,"Resistance of cancer cells to anoikis, apoptosis induced by cell detachment from the extracellular matrix, is thought to represent a critical feature of the malignant phenotype. Mechanisms that control anoikis of normal and cancer cells are understood only in part. Previously we found that anoikis of non-malignant intestinal epithelial cells is driven by detachment-induced down-regulation of Bcl-XL, a protein that blocks apoptosis through preventing the release of death-promoting factors from the mitochondria. Mitochondrial proteins the release of which causes anoikis are presently unknown. Similar to what was previously observed by others for keratinocytes and fibroblasts, we show here that anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells does not involve caspase-9, a target of a mitochondrial protein cytochrome c. Furthermore, Smac/Diablo, another mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factor, does not appear to play a role in detachment-dependent apoptosis of these cells either. Instead, anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells is triggered by the release of a mitochondrial protein Omi/HtrA2, an event driven by detachment-induced down-regulation of Bcl-XL. Moreover, we established that oncogenic ras inhibits anoikis by preventing the release of Omi/HtrA2. This effect of ras required ras-induced down-regulation of a pro-apoptotic protein Bak and could be blocked by an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, a target of Ras that was previously implicated by us in the down-regulation of Bak and blockade of anoikis. We conclude that Omi/HtrA2 is an inducer of anoikis and an important regulator of ras-induced transformation.

Unlike normal epithelial cells, carcinomas (cancers of epithelial origin) grow, invade, and metastasize as disorganized three-dimensional cellular aggregates in which cells are deprived of adhesion to the basement membrane but remain anoikis-resistant.

Some of the molecular events that are involved in the inhibition of anoikis in tumor cells have been identified but the knowledge about the mechanisms by which these cells escape anoikis is far from complete. It is now known that activated ras, one of the most frequently occurring oncogenes, acts as a strong inhibitor of anoikis of various types of cells, including those of the intestinal epithelium (1Rak J.

Ras is a small GTPase that can be activated by numerous mitogenic stimuli and, once activated can, in turn, trigger various signaling pathways that alter diverse biological cellular characteristics (12Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The oncogenic form of Ras is locked in a GTP-bound state as a result of point mutations and thus acquires the ability to activate its downstream targets in a constitutive manner. So far oncogenic Ras was shown to block anoikis by multiple mechanisms that alter the expression of several direct regulators of apoptosis (10Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J.

Upon induction by cytochrome c and another pro-apoptotic molecule APAF-1, initiator caspase-9 activates the executioner caspases, such as caspases-3 and -7 (23Wang J. Lenardo M.J. J.

MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mitochondrial factors, such as Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2 are capable of sequestering the IAPs and thus promoting caspase activation (15Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

AIF and endonuclease G are two other mitochondrial factors that upon release from the mitochondria trigger programmed cell death by inducing fragmentation of chromosomal DNA (27Susin S.A. Zamzami N.

Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). The release of the death-promoting proteins from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm can be stimulated or blocked by pro-apoptotic (Bak, Bim, etc.) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, etc.) proteins of the Bcl-2 family, respectively (20Olson M. Kornbluth S. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 29Adams J.M.

The second major apoptotic pathway is typically triggered by members of the death receptor family, such as Fas, after activation by their ligands, such as Fas ligand. Once engaged, death receptors induce initiator caspases-8 and -10 through the adaptor molecule FADD (31Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

We and other have shown that detachment of epithelial cells from the ECM results in changes in the expression or activity of various components of apoptotic machinery (13Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For example, according to our data, anoikis of non-malignant intestinal epithelial cells is driven by two simultaneously occurring death-promoting events. The first event involves detachment-dependent inhibition of expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-XL (42Rosen K. Coll M.L. Li A. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37273-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 43Coll M.L. Rosen K. Ladeda V. Filmus J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second mechanism is mediated by detachment-triggered induction of p38 MAP kinase and subsequent p38 MAP kinase-dependent overexpression of Fas ligand (36Rosen K. Shi W. Calabretta B. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46123-46130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras is now known to block anoikis by activating several pathways. For example, we found that in the case of intestinal epithelial cells, the inhibitory effect of Ras on anoikis is mediated by Ras-dependent activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and subsequent PI 3-kinase driven down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bak (10Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also established that Ras prevents anoikis of these cells by blocking detachment-induced down-regulation of Bcl-XL (13Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, data obtained by others suggest that this oncogene suppresses detachment-dependent apoptosis of epithelial cells from breast, intestine, and other organs by down-regulating a death-inducing Bcl-2 family member Bim (39Reginato M.J. Mills K.R. Paulus J.K. Lynch D.K. Sgroi D.C. Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Given that oncogenic Ras blocks detachment-dependent apoptosis by more than one mechanism, therapeutic targeting of anoikis resistance of ras-transformed cells based on the simultaneous suppression of these mechanisms could obviously be practically difficult. In this regard, one common feature of the mediators of the anti-anoikis effect of ras, such as Bak, Bcl-XL, and Bim, is that they ultimately control the release of various mitochondrial factors into the cellular cytoplasm. Thus, delivery of such factor(s) into the cytoplasm of those tumor cells that carry the ras oncogene may represent an efficient strategy for overcoming their anoikis resistance. However, mitochondrial mediators of apoptosis that are involved in the control of anoikis of normal and cancer cells are presently unknown. According to recent studies, caspase-9, a target of cytochrome c, does not appear to be involved in the execution of detachment-induced apoptosis (44Marconi A. Atzei P. Panza C. Fila C. Tiberio R. Truzzi F. Wachter T. Leverkus M. Pincelli C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5815-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G.

This conclusion is based on the fact that embryonic fibroblasts derived from caspase-9 and Apaf-1 knock-out mice are as susceptible to anoikis as their wild type counterparts (45Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Tomaselli K.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Vaux D.L. Bouillet P. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Nature. 2002; 419: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-fmk (46Ozoren N. Kim K. Burns T.F. Dicker D.T. Moscioni A.D. El Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6259-6265PubMed Google Scholar), was demonstrated to be unable to block anoikis of human keratinocytes (44Marconi A. Atzei P. Panza C. Fila C. Tiberio R. Truzzi F. Wachter T. Leverkus M. Pincelli C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5815-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We show in this study that anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells is caspase-9- and Smac/Diablo-independent but requires the activity of Omi/HtrA2. We demonstrate that the release of Omi into the cytoplasm of these cells is driven by detachment-induced down-regulation of Bcl-XL. We also show that the ras oncogene prevents the release of Omi and subsequent anoikis by blocking the expression of Bak. Cell Culture—The generation of the IEC clones expressing activated H-ras and Bcl-XL, of mouse colonocytes as well as of ras knock-out derivatives of the HCT-116 cells. Hkh-2 has been described elsewhere (1Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1587-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 47Filmus J. Shi W.

IEC-18 cells and their derivatives as well as mouse colonocytes were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5% glucose. HCT-116 and Hkh-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To culture cells in the absence of adhesion to the ECM, cells were plated in suspension culture above a layer of 1% sea plaque-agarose polymerized in α-minimal essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Vectors—pcDNA-3-encoded Omi-GFP fusion construct was provided by Dr. J. Downward, Imperial Cancer Research Fund. pEGFP-C1 expression vector was from Clontech. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (13Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Smac (R & D Systems), anti-Omi (R & D Systems), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-Bak (Upstate), and anti-caspase-9 (Cell Signaling). Preparation of Cytosolic Fraction—Preparation of cytosolic fraction was performed as described by others (2Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cells were first washed and then re-suspended in 25 μl of a buffer containing 70 mm Tris base, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Subsequently an equal volume of digitonin dissolved at 0.2 mg/ml in a buffer containing 19.8 mm EGTA, 19.8 mm EDTA, 0.25 m d-mannitol, and 19.8 mm MES, pH 7.4, was added to the samples for 5 min on ice. This mixture was then subjected to centrifugation at 900 × g for 2 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant obtained after this centrifugation was subsequently analyzed for the presence of cytochrome c, Smac, or Omi by Western blot. Caspase-9 Activity Assay—A caspase-9 Colorimetric Assay kit from R & D Systems was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Interference—All transfections with siRNAs were performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To block caspase-9 expression in IEC-18 cells by caspase-9 siRNA1 and caspase-9 siRNA2 or Omi expression by Omi siRNA2 and Omi siRNA3, 5 × 105 cells were transfected with 100 nm of either previously published nonspecific control siRNA (50Srinivasula S.M. Gupta S. Datta P. Zhang Z. Hegde R. Cheong N. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31469-31472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or each of the respective caspase-9- or Omi-specific siRNAs for 48 h. In the case of Omi siRNA1 efficient inhibition of Omi expression could only be achieved after 5 × 105 IEC-18 cells were subjected to 2 consecutive 48-h rounds of transfection with 250 nm Omi-siRNA1. In this case the control cells were also subjected to 2 consecutive 48-h rounds of transfection with 250 nm of the control siRNA. In the case of the experiments involving simultaneous transfection of cells with Omi siRNA3 and caspase-9 siRNA2 we found that these RNAs when co-transfected at concentrations higher than 25 nm each, reduced the ability of each other to down-regulate their respective targets, possibly because of the fact that at these concentrations they competed for the same components of the cellular RNA interference machinery. When cells were co-transfected with Omi- and caspase-9-specific siRNAs at 25 nm each, these RNAs were capable of efficiently blocking the expression of their respective targets. Thus, 5 × 105 cells were co-transfected with 25 nm Omi siRNA3 and 25 nm caspase-9 siRNA2 for 48 h. To ensure that in this series of experiments concentration of the total transfected RNA remained identical in all samples, the expression of Omi alone was blocked by co-transfecting cells with 25 nm Omi siRNA3 and 25 nm of the control RNA. Accordingly, the respective control cells were transfected with 50 nm of the control RNA. The sequences of the sense strands of the RNAs used in this study were as follows: control RNA, UGUUGUUUGAGGGGAACGGTT; Omi siRNA1, GGGGAGUUUGUUGUUGCCATT; Omi siRNA2, CGAUGCAGCUAUUGACUUUUU; Omi siRNA3, CAUUAAGGAUUCAAACCAAUU; caspase-9 siRNA1, CAAUGGGACUCAAAUCAAAUU; and caspase-9 siRNA2, CGAGAGACAUGCAGAUAUGUU. All siRNAs were from Dharmacon. Survival Assay after Omi RNA Interference—After transfection with the control or Omi-specific siRNAs, 1 × 103 IEC-18 cells were plated in monolayer either immediately or after being cultured in suspension for various times. Cells were allowed to form colonies for 7 days, colonies were then visualized by Crystal Violet staining and counted. Omi-induced Apoptosis Assay—5 × 105 of IEC-ras or IEC-BclX cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transfected for 4 h with either 2 μg of pEGFP-C1 or 2 μg of Omi-GFP expression vector in the presence of 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were further grown for 48 h under standard tissue culture conditions and plated in monolayer and suspension culture for 17 h. Cells were then trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and morphology of GFP-positive cells was assessed by fluorescent microscopy. Condensed cells were scored as apoptotic. Drug-induced Apoptosis Assay—103 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and treated with various concentrations of drugs for 24 h. Culture medium was then changed to fresh medium. Cells were allowed to form colonies for 7 days, colonies were visualized by Crystal Violet staining and counted. Cell Death ELISA—Cells growing in monolayer or in suspension culture were assayed for the presence of nucleosomal fragments in the cytoplasm by a Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay—This assay was described elsewhere (51Liu Z. Li H. Derouet M. Filmus J. LaCasse E.C. Korneluk R.G. Kerbel R.S. Rosen K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37383-37392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 Antagonists Do Not Block Anoikis of Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Recent findings indicate that embryonic fibroblasts derived from caspase-9 and Apaf-1 knock-out mice are as prone to die by anoikis as their wild type counterparts (45Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Tomaselli K.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Vaux D.L. Bouillet P. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Nature. 2002; 419: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Likewise, it has been shown that Z-LEHD-fmk, an established inhibitor of caspase-9 (46Ozoren N. Kim K. Burns T.F. Dicker D.T. Moscioni A.D. El Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6259-6265PubMed Google Scholar), does not block anoikis of human keratinocytes (44Marconi A. Atzei P. Panza C. Fila C. Tiberio R. Truzzi F. Wachter T. Leverkus M. Pincelli C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5815-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken collectively, these data indicate that caspase-9, a target of cytochrome c, is not involved in anoikis of fibroblasts and skin epithelial cells. In search for mitochondrial factor(s) responsible for anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells we decided to test whether caspase-9 plays a causal role in detachment-induced apoptosis of these cells. To this end, we first measured the presence of cytochrome c in the cytosolic extracts of non-malignant anoikis-susceptible rat intestinal epithelial cells, IEC-18 (1Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1587-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that were cultured in monolayer (attached to the ECM) or suspension (detached from the ECM). We found that detachment of these cells results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). We further assayed IEC-18 cells for caspase-9 activity by measuring the ability of lysates derived from these cells to cleave LEHD-pNA tetrapeptide, a known substrate of caspase-9 (52Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, detachment triggered transient activation of caspase-9 around 14 h after loss of adhesion to the ECM. It has to be noted here that previously we observed a significant degree of anoikis of these cells as early as 4 h upon detachment (∼10 h prior to caspase-9 induction) (13Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which indicates that caspase-9 might not play a causal role in this type of apoptosis. To address the role of caspase-9 in anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells in a more definitive way we transfected IEC-18 cells with 2 different caspase-9-specific siRNAs, caspase-9 siRNA1 and caspase-9 siRNA2. We used a published nonspecific RNA (50Srinivasula S.M. Gupta S. Datta P. Zhang Z. Hegde R. Cheong N. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31469-31472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, transfection with each caspase-9-specific siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of caspase-9 levels in IEC-18 cells. Enforced down-regulation of caspase-9, however, did not lead to a significant increase in the viability of these cells after they were cultured in the absence of adhesion to the ECM for 24 (Fig. 1, C and D) or 48 h (not shown). Conversely, in agreement with what we found before, we observed that IEC-BclX3, a representative clone of several previously published clones of IEC-18 cells constitutively expressing exogenous Bcl-XL (13Rosen K.

https://openalex.org/W2171252997,"Our studies indicate that the regulatory factor for X-box (RFX) family proteins repress collagen α2(I) gene (COL1A2) expression (Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49134–49144; Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 41319–41332). In this study, we examined the mechanism(s) underlying the repression of collagen gene by RFX proteins. Two members of the RFX family, RFX1 and RFX5, associate with distinct sets of co-repressors on the collagen transcription start site in vitro. RFX5 specifically interacts with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and the mammalian transcriptional repressor (mSin3B), whereas RFX1 preferably interacts with HDAC1 and mSin3A. HDAC2 cooperates with RFX5 to down-regulate collagen promoter activity, whereas HDAC1 enhances inhibition of collagen promoter activity by RFX1. Interferon-γ promotes the recruitment of RFX5/HDAC2/mSin3B to the collagen transcription start site but decreases the occupancy by RFX1/mSin3A as manifested by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. RFX1 binds to the methylated collagen sequence with much higher affinity than unmethylated sequence, recruiting more HDAC1 and mSin3A. The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, which inhibits DNA methylation, reduces RFX1/HDAC1 binding to the collagen transcription start site in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, both RFX1 and RFX5 are acetylated in vivo. Trichostatin A stimulates the acetylation of RFX proteins and activates the collagen promoter activity. Collectively, our data strongly indicate two separate pathways for RFX proteins to repress collagen gene expression as follows: one for RFX5/HDAC2 in interferon-γ-mediated repression, and the other for RFX1/HDAC1 in methylation-mediated collagen silencing. Our studies indicate that the regulatory factor for X-box (RFX) family proteins repress collagen α2(I) gene (COL1A2) expression (Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D.

Collagen, currently consisting of more than 27 members, is a large family of extracellular matrix proteins that play vital structural and physiological roles maintaining the integrity and contributing to homeostasis of the human body (3Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Because of their diverse structures and distributions as well as complex interactions with other components of the extracellular matrix, expression and regulation of collagen proteins are extremely complicated, yet critical processes, which occur at multiple levels as follows: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational. Type I collagen, composed of two α1(I) (COL1A1) chains and one α2(I) (COL1A2) chain, is the most abundantly expressed member of the collagen genes, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining homeostasis. The transcription of these genes is important during development and repair of injury. Transcription of eukaryotic genes is controlled by coordination of large complexes composed of activators/co-activators or repressors/corepressors, which function to alter histone-DNA structure in highly ordered chromatin. Histones are subjected to a number of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (4Hauser C. Schuettengruber B. Bartl S. Lagger G. Seiser C. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These modifications, termed “histone code,” greatly impact the chromatin structure, which in turn leads to permissive or unfavorable access of transcription factors to a particular promoter causing the differential transcriptional activity of that promoter (12Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7652) Google Scholar, 15Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6605) Google Scholar). For example, a high level of acetylation on certain lysines on the tail of histones H3 and H4 is often associated with loose chromatin structure, favorable binding of activators/co-activators, and high rates of transcription, whereas a low level of acetylation is usually accompanied by compact chromatin structure, denial of access of activators/co-activators to promoters, and low rate of transcription (16Boffa L.C.

It is not only the intensity of acetylation/deacetylation but also the specific sites becoming acetylated or deacetylated that dictate the overall transcriptional outcome. Acetylation of histones is a dynamic and reversible process that is catalyzed by two groups of antagonistic enzymes called histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC). 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; RFX, regulatory factor for X-box; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; aza-dC,5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; TSA, trichostatin A; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MHC, major histocompatibility; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siHDAC, silencing HDACs; CIITA, class II transactivator. 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; RFX, regulatory factor for X-box; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; aza-dC,5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; TSA, trichostatin A; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MHC, major histocompatibility; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; siHDAC, silencing HDACs; CIITA, class II transactivator. So far, 18 different HDACs have been identified and categorized into three groups based on their homology to three yeast HDACs. Class I HDACs, containing HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8, are homologous to yeast yRPD3 and are expressed in most tissues (20Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N.

Both class I and class II HDACs are sensitive to such inhibitors as trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate. Class III HDACs are mammalian homologs to yeast SIR2 protein that have distinct catalytic domains compared with both class I and II HDACs and are dependent on NAD for enzymatic activity (31Kyrylenko S. Kyrylenko O. Suuronen T. Salminen A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Thiagalingam S. Cheng K.H. Lee H.J. Mineva N. Thiagalingam A. Ponte J.F.

Class I HDACs are invariably found in multimolecular complexes containing other repressor/co-repressor proteins. For example, the NuRD complex is composed of HDAC1, HDAC2, and methyl group binding protein (33Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat.

Another commonly found HDAC-containing complex is the Sin3 complex that consists of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in addition to Sin3-associated polypeptides SAP18 and SAP30 (35Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C.

The major focus of research at this laboratory has been toward understanding the transcriptional events occurring at the transcription start site of type I collagen genes. Earlier investigations have led to the discovery of a binding site for the regulatory factor for X-box (RFX) at the transcription start site of both α1(I) and α2(I) genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2 (38Sengupta P.

Binding of two members of RFX proteins, RFX1 and RFX5, to the start sites of the type I collagen genes represses their expression. RFX1 is able to form dimers with itself as well as with two other RFX members, RFX2 and RFX3, with which RFX1 shares significant homology, including the dimerization domain that mediates the complex formation. On the other hand, RFX5, lacking the dimerization domain, is less homologous to other family members and forms a trimeric complex with two other proteins, RFXB and RFXAP (1Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RFX5 is also responsible for recruiting class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator for major histocompatibility II (MHC II) expression, to the collagen transcription start site during IFN-γ response (2Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41319-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although both RFX1 and RFX5 down-regulate collagen expression, their distinct association with other transcription factors suggests that they are involved in different physiological and pathophysiological events leading to the repression of collagen synthesis. Our results presented here demonstrate that RFX1 and RFX5 differentially interact with class I HDACs, underlying the different pathways when repressing collagen synthesis. Cell Culture Maintenance and Treatment Protocols—Human lung fibroblasts, IMR-90, (IMR, NJ), human kidney cells 293FT (Invitrogen), and human fibrosarcoma cells HT1080 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 1% penicillin G/streptomycin (Sigma). In several studies, IMR-90 cells were treated with IFN-γ and/or TSA (Sigma). IMR-90 fibroblasts were plated in p150 tissue culture dishes at 4 × 106 cells/dish and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS for 16–24 h. Cells were pretreated in DMEM with 0.4% FBS for 16 h prior to IFN-γ treatment (100 units/ml in 0.4% DMEM for 0, 8, 16, or 24 h) and/or TSA treatment (0.5–2 μm for 24 h where applicable). IFN-γ and TSA was added together. In other studies, HT1080 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells per p35 tissue culture dish and treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) (500 nm and 1 μm) for 3 days in DMEM adding fresh aza-dC each day. In some studies HT1080 cells were treated with TSA (300 nm) for 24 h. DNA Affinity Pull-down Assay—The collagen sequence (COL1A2 –25/+30, GenBank™ accession number AF004877) with a HindIII overhang was synthesized as complementary strands and annealed as described previously (40Sengupta P.K. Erhlich M. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36649-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Double-stranded collagen DNA was biotin-labeled by incubating with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen) supplemented with regular dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was phenol/chloroform-extracted and alcohol-precipitated to remove unincorporated biotin. Nuclear protein extracts from IMR-90 cells were obtained as described previously using 450 mm sodium chloride (1Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). The streptavidin beads (Promega, Madison, WI) were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm PMSF. Nuclear proteins (100–200 μg) were pre-cleared by incubating with the washed beads for 30 min at 4 °C on a shaking platform as described previously (2Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41319-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pre-cleared nuclear proteins were prepared by capturing the beads on a magnetic stand and removing the supernatant. The supernatant was then incubated with biotin-labeled collagen DNA probe (–25/+30) for 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer (60 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with bovine serum albumin, poly(dI-dC), and sonicated salmon sperm DNA to remove nonspecific binding. DNA-protein complex formed was captured by the magnetic beads and washed extensively with binding buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X and 100 mm KCl. The bound proteins were eluted with 1× electrophoresis sample buffer by incubating at 90 °C for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Plasmids, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—The COL1A2-luciferase construct (pH20) (42Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains sequences from –221 to +54 bp of mouse COL1A2 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Full-length class I HDAC expression constructs (HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3) in pcDNA3 and silencing HDACs (43Zhang X. Wharton W. Yuan Z. Tsai S.C. Olashaw N. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5106-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Edward Seto. Full-length FLAG-RFX5 were kindly provided by Dr. Jenny Ting. RFX1 cDNA was excised from pHISB-RFX-1 plasmid, respectively, and inserted into the pIRES-hrGFP-2A construct (Stratagene) that has green fluorescent protein-coding sequence. RFX1 plasmid was digested with NotI and XhoI to produce the 5-kb vector along with 3-kb fragment. The RFX1 fragment was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI site of the pIRES-hrGFP-2A plasmid. This bicistronic plasmid can encode the protein along with the green fluorescent protein when expressed in mammalian cell lines. Cells were plated at the density of 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture dishes (for IMR-90 cells) or 5 × 106 cells per p100 tissue culture dish (for 293FT cells). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase assays were performed with a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Immunoprecipitations—To investigate whether factors interact in vivo, co-immunoprecipitations were performed. Whole cell lysates (IMR-90 or 293FT with transfected constructs as indicated where applicable) were obtained by resuspending cell pellets in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) with freshly added protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and PMSF (100 μg/ml RIPA). Anti-RFX5 (194, Rockland) or anti-RFX1 (I-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody was added to and incubated with IMR-90 cell lysate overnight before being absorbed by protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitated immune complex was released by boiling with 1× SDS electrophoresis sample buffer. Alternatively, FLAG-conjugated beads (M2; Sigma) were added to and incubated with 293FT cell lysate overnight. Precipitated immune complex was eluted with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). Westerns—Proteins were separated by 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with pre-stained markers (Bio-Rad) for estimating molecular weight and efficiency of transfer to blots. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a Mini-Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline buffer (TBST: 0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight and incubated for 3 h to monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:1000) (Sigma), polyclonal anti-RFX5 (194, 1:1000) (Rockland), polyclonal anti-mSin3A (K-20, 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-mSin3B (AK-12, 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 (H-51, 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-HDAC2 (C-19, 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-HDAC3 (H-99, 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal N-acetyl-lysine (1:2000) (Cell Signaling), and polyclonal anti-RFX1 (I-19, 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, either anti-goat IgG (Sigma), anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, for another 1 h at room temperature. Then protein blots were visualized using ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a Kodak image station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Chromatin in control and IFN-γ treated cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min at room temperature, sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline, Solution I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.75% Triton X-100), and Solution II (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and PMSF. DNA was fragmented into ∼500-bp pieces using a Branson 250 sonicator. Aliquots of lysates containing 200 μg of protein were used for each immunoprecipitation reaction with anti-RFX5 (194; Rockland), anti-RFX1 (I-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mSin3A (K-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mSin3B (AK-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 (H-51; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC2 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-HDAC3 (H-99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies followed by adsorption to protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitated DNA-protein complexes were washed sequentially with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), LiCl buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0), respectively. DNA-protein cross-link was reversed by heating the samples to 65 °C overnight. Proteins were digested with proteinase K (Sigma), and DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted and precipitated by 100% ethanol. Dried DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of deionized distilled water, and 10 μl was used for each real time PCR. The primers surrounding the collagen start site for real time PCR have been described previously (1Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR—Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using a SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real time PCRs were performed on a ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotide forward and reverse PCR primers and fluorescent probes are described in Table 1.TABLE 1Primers for mRNA and hnRNA real time PCRGeneAmplicon locationExonSequencesCOL1A2 mRNAaGenBank™ accession number AF004877.7568-7650/8929-8965Forward primerExon 55′-GCCCCCCAGGCAGAGA-3′TaqMan probeExon 5/66FAM-CCTGGTCTCGGTGGGAACTTTGCTG-TAMRAbThe TaqMan probes contained a fluorescent dye (FAM) and a quencher (TAMRA).Reverse primerExon 65′-CCAACTCCTTTTCCATCATACTGA-3′COL1A2 hnRNAaGenBank™ accession number AF004877.2468-2552Forward primerExon15′-CTTGCAGTAACCTTATGCCTAGCA-3′TaqMan probeExon 1/Intron 16FAM-CATGCCAATGTAAGTGCCTTCAGCTTGTT-TAMRAbThe TaqMan probes contained a fluorescent dye (FAM) and a quencher (TAMRA).Reverse primerIntron 15′-CCCATCTAACCTCTCTACCCAGTCT-3′a GenBank™ accession number AF004877.b The TaqMan probes contained a fluorescent dye (FAM) and a quencher (TAMRA). Open table in a new tab RFX1 and RFX5 Differentially Interact with Class I HDACs on COL1A2 Transcription Start Site—Previously, we reported that two members of the RFX family, RFX1 and RFX5, bind to the transcription start site of the COL1A2 gene and repress its expression (39Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24926-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). During IFN-γ treatment, when RFX5 occupies the COL1A2 transcription start site, there is a coordinate decrease in acetylation of histones (1Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because transcriptional repression is usually associated with the recruitment of HDACs, we examined whether RFX1 and/or RFX5 is responsible for recruiting the HDACs to the collagen site. To this end, DNA affinity pull-down experiments were performed, as described previously (2Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41319-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with nuclear proteins extracted from human IMR-90 cells and a biotin-labeled double-stranded DNA probe that spans from –25 to +30 of the collagen promoter containing the RFX-binding site. Different DNA oligonucleotides were also used as competitors for RFX binding to test the specificity of the interactions. Streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads were used to sequester the biotinylated probe with bound nuclear proteins. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with SDS electrophoresis buffer, separated on SDS-10% PAGE, and transferred to membranes for Western analysis using specific antibodies for RFX and HDAC family members. No proteins were present in the eluates without a DNA probe (Fig. 1, A, lane 2, and B, lane 3). In the presence of the DNA probe, RFX1 is detected in the eluates along with HDAC1 (Fig. 1, A, lane 3, and B, lane 4). When a methylated sequence, which acts as a competitor specifically eliminating the binding of RFX1 (mpBR), is added as demonstrated previously (40Sengupta P.K. Erhlich M. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36649-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), HDAC1 binding is also lost (Fig. 1, A, lane 4, and B, lane 5). This indicates that RFX1 selectively interacts with HDAC1 on the collagen start site. In contrast, RFX5 is able to bind to DNA in the absence of RFX1 along with HDAC2 (Fig. 1, A, lane 4, and B, lane 5), suggesting a selective interaction between RFX5 and HDAC2. The MHC II X-box sequence abolishes the binding of RFX1 (Fig. 1A, lane 5) and RFX5 (Fig. 1B, lane 6), as well as the two HDACs, whereas neither Sp1 nor Ets consensus sequence alters the binding of RFX1, HDAC1, RFX5, or HDAC2, implying that the interactions are specific. A third class I HDAC, HDAC3, is not detectable under any of these circumstances, probably because it is not recruited to the collagen transcription start site through RFX proteins. IFN-γ Enhances the Interaction between RFX5 and Co-repressors—Earlier studies indicated that IFN-γ increased RFX5 protein levels, nuclear localization, and occupation on the collagen start site in IMR-90 cells (1Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49134-49144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because there was an interaction between RFX5 and HDACs, RFX5 may recruit more HDACs and IFN-γ could enhance the association between RFX5 and HDACs at the collagen transcription start site. Increased HDACs could inhibit histone acetylation and ultimately repress collagen transcription. To test this hypothesis, DNA affinity pull-down experiments were performed first with nuclear proteins extracted from IMR-90 cells treated with or without IFN-γ (100 units) for 24 h. Both RFX1 and HDAC1 bind to the collagen sequence with similar af"
https://openalex.org/W1997955664,"Methylglyoxal (MG) is a typical 2-oxoaldehyde derived from glycolysis. We have recently found that MG activates transcription factors such as Yap1 and Msn2, and triggers a Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Regarding the activation of Hog1 by MG, we found that Sln1, an osmosensor possessing histidine kinase activity, functions as a sensor of MG (Maeta, K., Izawa, S., and Inoue, Y. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 253–260). To gain further insight into the role of MG as a signal initiator, here we analyze the response of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to extracellular MG. Spc1, a stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), was phosphorylated following the treatment with MG. No phosphorylation was observed in a wis1Δ mutant. The His-to-Asp phosphorelay system consisting of three histidine kinases (Phk1, Phk2, and Phk3), a phosphorelay protein (Spy1), and a response regulator (Mcs4) exists upstream of the Spc1-SAPK pathway. The phosphorylation of Spc1 following MG treatment was observed in phk1Δphk2Δphk3Δ and spy1Δ cells, but not in mcs4Δ cells. These results suggest that S. pombe has an alternative module(s) that directs the MG signal to the SAPK pathway via Mcs4. Additionally, we found that the transcription factor Pap1 is concentrated in the nucleus in response to MG, independent of the Spc1-SAPK pathway. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a typical 2-oxoaldehyde derived from glycolysis. We have recently found that MG activates transcription factors such as Yap1 and Msn2, and triggers a Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Regarding the activation of Hog1 by MG, we found that Sln1, an osmosensor possessing histidine kinase activity, functions as a sensor of MG (Maeta, K., Izawa, S., and Inoue, Y. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 253–260). To gain further insight into the role of MG as a signal initiator, here we analyze the response of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to extracellular MG. Spc1, a stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), was phosphorylated following the treatment with MG. No phosphorylation was observed in a wis1Δ mutant. The His-to-Asp phosphorelay system consisting of three histidine kinases (Phk1, Phk2, and Phk3), a phosphorelay protein (Spy1), and a response regulator (Mcs4) exists upstream of the Spc1-SAPK pathway. The phosphorylation of Spc1 following MG treatment was observed in phk1Δphk2Δphk3Δ and spy1Δ cells, but not in mcs4Δ cells. These results suggest that S. pombe has an alternative module(s) that directs the MG signal to the SAPK pathway via Mcs4. Additionally, we found that the transcription factor Pap1 is concentrated in the nucleus in response to MG, independent of the Spc1-SAPK pathway. Methylglyoxal (MG, 2The abbreviations used are: MG, methylglyoxal; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; DEM, diethylmaleimide; HA, hemagglutinin; EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium. 2The abbreviations used are: MG, methylglyoxal; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; DEM, diethylmaleimide; HA, hemagglutinin; EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium. CH3COCHO) is a typical 2-oxoaldehyde derived from glycolysis, a ubiquitous energy-generating system present in all types of organism; nevertheless, MG inhibits the growth of cells (1Kalapos M.P. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 110: 145-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). For example, MG induces apoptosis in some mammalian cells by provoking production of reactive oxygen species (2Du J. Suzuki H. Nagase F. Akhand A.A. Yokoyama T. Miyata T. Kurokawa K. Nakashima I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Actually, cells exhibiting MG-induced apoptosis, such as Jurkat cells and HL60 cells, are sensitive to reactive oxygen species (3Du J. Suzuki H. Nagase F. Akhand A.A. Ma X.Y. Yokoyama T. Miyata T. Nakashima I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Nakagawa H. Hasumi K. Woo J.T. Nagai K. Wachi M. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MG induces necrosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Maeta K. Mori K. Takatsume Y. Izawa S. Inoue Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 243: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this case, MG does not enhance production of reactive oxygen species, and therefore, mutants lacking antioxidant enzymes (for example sod1Δ, sod2Δ, and gpx3Δ) do not show increased sensitivity to MG (5Maeta K. Mori K. Takatsume Y. Izawa S. Inoue Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 243: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Because the major source of MG is glycolysis, and an overaccumulation of MG adversely affects cellular function, cells of all types possess a ubiquitous enzymatic pathway, the glyoxalase system, for detoxification of MG. The glyoxalase system consists of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II. The former catalyzes the conversion of MG to S-d-lactoylglutathione in the presence of glutathione. The latter hydrolyzes the resultant glutathione thiolester to d-lactic acid and glutathione (see Fig. 1). Previously, we have reported that the disruption of GLO1, the structural gene for glyoxalase I, enhances susceptibility to MG in S. cerevisiae (6Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A mutant defective in glyoxalase II was also sensitive to MG (7Bito A. Haider M. Hadler I. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21509-21519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, S. cerevisiae has another enzymatic route by which to convert MG to lactic acid, i.e. MG is reduced to l-lactaldehyde by the action of an NADPH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase, and l-lactaldehyde is further oxidized to l-lactic acid by an NAD+-dependent lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (8Inoue Y. Kimura A. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1995; 37: 177-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Inoue Y. Kimura A. Proc. Japan Acad. 1999; 75: 127-132Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Chen et al. (10Chen C.N. Porubleva L. Shearer G. Svrakic M. Holden L.G. Dover J.L. Johnston M. Chitnis P.R. Kohl D.H. Yeast. 2003; 20: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have reported that GRE2 encodes methylglyoxal reductase, although, as far as we could determine, gre2Δ cells were not sensitive to MG. 3K. Maeta, S. Izawa, and Y. Inoue, unpublished results. 3K. Maeta, S. Izawa, and Y. Inoue, unpublished results. Aguilera and Prieto (11Aguilera J. Prieto J.A. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have reported that GRE3 encodes aldose reductase that is involved in the metabolism of MG; however, a gre3Δ mutant did not exhibit an MG-sensitive phenotype. Consequently, the glyoxalase system is the major pathway to detoxify MG in S. cerevisiae (12Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that a glyoxalase I-deficient mutant of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was also sensitive to MG (13Takatsume Y. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Aberrant metabolism of MG has been implicated in diseases such as colon cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and autism (14Ranganathan S. Walsh E.S. Godwin A.K. Tew K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5661-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Thornalley P.J. Hooper N.I. Jennings P.E. Florkowski C.M. Jones A.F. Lunec J. Barnett A.H. Diabetes Res. Clin. Prac. 1989; 7: 115-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Ahmed N. Ahmed U. Thornalley P.J. Hager K. Fleischer G. Munch G. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 17Junaid M.A. Kowal D. Barua M. Pullarkat P.S. Sklower Brooks S. Pullarkat R.K. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 131: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, in type 2 diabetes, the basal activity of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family is increased, and the up-regulation of p38, one of the MAP kinases, is associated with a loss of expression of the GLUT4 glucose transporter that results in a lowering of glucose uptake, which may exacerbate hyperglycemia (18Carlson C.J. Koterski S. Sciotti R.J. Poccard G.B. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is implied that there is a correlation between high MG levels and increased basal activation of p38 in type 2 diabetes. However, it remains to be clarified whether a high MG level is a consequence of diabetes, or diabetes induces aberrant MG metabolism, which leads to an increase in the MG level. We have recently found that extracellular MG activates Hog1-MAP kinase, a homologue of p38 MAP kinase in S. cerevisiae (19Maeta K. Izawa S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Later, Aguilera et al. (20Aguilera J. Rodriguez-Vargas S. Prieto J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported similar results. Therefore, MG seems to have the capability to activate p38 MAP kinase.We have also found that MG activates Yap1, a crucial transcription factor in the response to oxidative stress in S. cerevisiae (21Maeta K. Izawa S. Okazaki S. Kuge S. Inoue Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8753-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An intramolecular disulfide bond is formed between Cys residues of Yap1 following treatment with H2O2 with the aid of Gpx3 and Ybp1 (22Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 23Veal E.A. Ross S.J. Malakasi P. Peacock E. Morgan B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30896-30904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). By contrast, neither an intramolecular nor intermolecular disulfide bond is formed upon the activation of Yap1 by MG, although MG seems to modify Cys residues of Yap1 directly and reversibly (21Maeta K. Izawa S. Okazaki S. Kuge S. Inoue Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8753-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, Yap1 is constitutively activated in a glyoxalase I-deficient (glo1Δ) mutant because the steady state level of MG in glo1Δ cells is high (21Maeta K. Izawa S. Okazaki S. Kuge S. Inoue Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8753-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Besides oxidative stress response, Yap1 is involved in diverse aspects of cellular stress response, and consequently, the glo1Δ mutant exhibits a pleiotropic phenotype in terms of stress response, because of the constitutive activation of Yap1 through the aberrant metabolism of MG (21Maeta K. Izawa S. Okazaki S. Kuge S. Inoue Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8753-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Collectively, MG may function as a metabolite initiating signal transduction in yeast cells.In the present study, we show that MG triggers the activation of the Spc1/StyI stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), a MAP kinase, cascade in S. pombe. The His-to-Asp phosphorelay system consisting of histidine kinases (Phk1/Mak2, Phk2/Mak3, and Phk3/Mak1), phosphorelay protein (Spy1/Mpr1) and a response regulator (Mcs4) exists upstream of this SAPK pathway (see Fig. 1). Genetic analysis revealed that Phk1, Phk2, and Phk3 partially function as the upstream modulators for MG stress response in terms of Spc1 activation, although an additional protein that senses and directs the extracellular MG signal to Mcs4 is likely to be present. We also provide evidence that MG activates Pap1, a Yap1 homologue in S. pombe, and the SAPK pathway is not involved in the activation of Pap1 in contrast to the H2O2-dependent activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrain—S. pombe PR109 (h– leu1-32 ura4-D18) and mutants derived from this strain, JM544 (wis1Δ::ura4+), KS1366 (spc1Δ::ura4+), and TP108-3c (pap1Δ::ura4+) (24Nguyen A.N.

JY879 (h90 ade6-M210 leu1 ura4-D18) and mutants derived from this strain, PNN5 (phk1Δ::ura4+ phk2Δ::ura4+ phk3Δ::ura4+), PNN6 (spy1Δ::ura4+), and PNN7 (mcs4Δ::kanr), were donated by Dr. H. Aiba (27Aoyama K. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Media—Basically, S. pombe cells were cultured in YES medium (3% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, 100 μg/ml each of l-His, l-Leu, l-Lys, adenine, and uracil) at 28 °C unless otherwise stated. For determination of the intracellular MG level and cellular localization of EGFP-Pap1, cells were cultured in EMM medium (28Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar).Spot Assay—S. pombe cells were cultured in YES medium until the A595 reached 0.1 and were diluted with a sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution serially (1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000). Then, 3 μl of each cell suspension was spotted onto YES agar plates containing various concentrations of MG, and cells were cultured at 28 °C.Growth Experiment—Cells were cultured in 200-ml flasks containing 50 ml of YES medium at 28 °C with reciprocal shaking. When the A595 reached 1.0, 10 mm MG was added and cultivation was continued, and the A595 of the culture was monitored periodically.Western Blotting—Cells were cultured in YES medium at 28 °C until the A595 reached 0.8, and 10 mm MG or 0.3 mm H2O2 was added to the culture. After 10 min, cell extracts were prepared according to the method of Bell et al. (29Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To detect phosphorylated Spc1, anti-diphospho-p38 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used (30Shiozaki K. Russell P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Spc1 protein level was detected using anti-Hog1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The HA-tagged protein and Cdc2 (for loading control, Ref. 31Takatsume Y. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 183: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were detected using anti-HA antibody (New England Labs) and anti-Cdc2 (PSTAIRE) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively.Pap1 Mobility Assay—Cells carrying EGFP-Pap1 were cultured in EMM medium until the A595 reached 0.8, and 15 mm MG, 20 mm diethylmaleimide (DEM), or 15 mm MG + 20 mm DEM was added to the culture. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 28 °C. To remove chemicals, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with EMM medium, and incubated in the fresh EMM medium for 60 min. The nuclear localization of EGFP-Pap1 was monitored using a fluorescence microscope as described below. After incubation, cells (∼1.6 × 107 cells) were collected by centrifugation, washed with 20% trichloroacetic acid solution, and disrupted with glass beads in 20% trichloroacetic acid solution (200 μl). Cell homogenates were transferred to another tube, the glass beads were washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid (200 μl), and the resultant suspension was mixed. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C, 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellets were washed with acetone. The dried materials were suspended in the buffer (40 μl) containing 1% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA and 10 unit/ml calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (32Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Jones N. Ayté J. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After incubation, 10 μl of 5× sample buffer (non-reducing) was added, and the mixture was kept at 65 °C for 10 min, and the resultant sample was subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE. EGFP-Pap1 was detected by Western blotting using anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells expressing EGFP-Pap1 (pR41FPap1) (33Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were cultured in EMM medium at 28 °C until the A595 reached 0.2, and 10 mm MG or 0.3 mm H2O2 was added. Cells were incubated at 28 °C for 10 min, and the localization of EGFP-Pap1 was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51).Measurement of Intracellular MG Content—The extraction and measurement of cellular MG content were done as described previously (21Maeta K. Izawa S. Okazaki S. Kuge S. Inoue Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8753-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Measurement of Intracellular Oxidation Levels—The cellular oxidation level was measured using an oxidant-specific fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, as described previously (5Maeta K. Mori K. Takatsume Y. Izawa S. Inoue Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 243: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).RESULTSImportance of Spc1-SAPK for Growth in the Presence of MG—Recently, we found that the expression of GLO1 is enhanced in a Hog1-dependent fashion when cells are exposed to MG extracellularly, and therefore, hog1Δ cells were sensitive to MG (19Maeta K. Izawa S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine the significance of the Spc1-SAPK pathway in the MG-evoked response of S. pombe, the susceptibility to MG of mutants defective in the SAPK pathway was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2A, spc1Δ cells were sensitive to MG, although not as sensitive as glo1Δ cells. Wis1 is a MAP kinase kinase that phosphorylates Spc1 (Fig. 1), and therefore, a wis1Δ mutant was also sensitive to MG.FIGURE 2Effect of MG on growth of SAPK-deficient mutants. A, cells (WT, PR109; wis1Δ, JM544; spc1Δ, KS1366; and glo1Δ in PR109 background) cultured in YES medium until A595 = 0.1 were diluted serially, and aliquots of cell suspension were spotted onto YES agar plates containing 10 mm MG. Cells were cultured at 28 °C for 4 days. B, methylglyoxal was added to the culture in which cells were grown logarithmically (A595 = 1.0), and cultivation was continued at 28 °C. A595 was monitored periodically. Symbols used are: circle, WT (PR109); square, wis1Δ (JM544); triangle, spc1Δ (KS1366). An arrow indicates when MG was added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we treated the logarithmically growing S. pombe cells with MG (Fig. 2B). Cell growth in the wild-type strain was retarded by the addition of 10 mm MG, whereas that in spc1Δ and wis1Δ cells was severely repressed, although viability did not drop at this concentration. At much higher concentrations of MG, cells died rapidly (data not shown). These results suggest that the Spc1-SAPK pathway plays some role in cells challenged with moderate concentrations of MG.Spc1 Is Phosphorylated following MG Treatment—MG induces the phosphorylation of Hog1 in S. cerevisiae (19Maeta K. Izawa S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether Spc1 is phosphorylated in cells treated with MG, the status of Spc1 was monitored using anti-diphospho-p38 antibody. It has been reported that Spc1 is phosphorylated in response to various environmental stimuli (34Toone W.M. Jones N. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We reconfirmed that Spc1 was phosphorylated in cells exposed to H2O2, osmotic stress, and heat shock stress (Fig. 3A), and found that Spc1 was phosphorylated following the treatment with MG as well. The protein levels of Spc1 were determined using commercially available anti-Hog1 antibody (Fig. 3A). Because no immunoreactive band was detected in cells lacking Spc1 (Fig. 3A), use of the anti-Hog1 antibody to detect Spc1 protein in S. pombe seems appropriate. We verified the validity of this approach using an S. pombe strain expressing HA-tagged Spc1 (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of Spc1-HA was observed in cells treated with H2O2 or MG, and the amount of Spc1-HA protein in each cell was estimated to be equal using anti-HA antibody, a result that was reproduced using anti-Hog1 antibody (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we used a commercially available anti-Hog1 antibody to determine the Spc1 protein level.FIGURE 3Spc1-SAPK pathway is activated following MG treatment. A, cells (WT, PR109; spc1Δ, KS1366) were cultured in YES medium until A595 = 0.8 at 28 °C, then 0.3 mm H2O2, 1 m sorbitol (osmotic stress), or 10 mm MG was added to the culture, and the cells were cultured for another 1 h. For heat shock stress, the flask containing the cell culture was transferred to a water bath incubator preheated at 42 °C, and cultivation was continued for 1 h. Western blotting was carried out as described in the text. Anti-Hog1 antibody was used to detect Spc1 protein. The Cdc2 protein level was monitored as a loading control (32Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Jones N. Ayté J. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). B, cells carrying the Spc1-HA allele (AV8) were cultured as described above, and 10 mm MG or 0.3 mm H2O2 was added to the culture. After 1 h, cells were collected and Western blotting was carried out. C, cells (WT, PR109; wis1Δ, JM544) were cultured as described above and treated with 10 mm MG. Cells were collected at the prescribed time as indicated in the figure, and Western blotting was carried out.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because Spc1 is phosphorylated by Wis1 MAP kinase kinase, we determined the status of Spc1 in the wis1Δ mutant following the treatment with MG. As shown in Fig. 3C, Spc1 was not phosphorylated in wis1Δ cells even after 60 min of MG treatment, indicating that MG activates the SAPK pathway, leading to phosphorylation of Spc1.Mcs4 Functions as the Upstream Modulator for Activation of SAPK by MG—The His-to-Asp phosphorelay system has been identified upstream of the Spc1-SAPK pathway (Fig. 1). Buck et al. (35Buck V. Quinn J. Soto Pino T. Martin H. Saldanha J. Makino K. Morgan B.A. Millar J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have reported that Mak1, Mak2, and Mak3 (also referred to as Phk3, Phk1, and Phk2, respectively (27Aoyama K. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) are sensors of peroxides, which possess histidine kinase activity. Spy1 (also known as Mpr1) is a phosphorelay protein (also referred to as histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) factor) that converts phosphoric acid from the phosphorylated His residue of the sensor kinase to the Asp residue of the Mcs4 response regulator (Fig. 1) (36Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Another response regulator, Prr1, has been found in S. pombe (37Ohmiya R. Kato C. Yamada H. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although Prr1 is not linked to the Spc1-SAPK pathway regarding the response to oxidative stress (37Ohmiya R. Kato C. Yamada H. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38Nakamichi N. Yanada H. Aiba H. Aoyama K. Ohmiya R. Mizuno T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2003; 67: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To address whether this His-to-Asp phosphorelay system (Phk1/Phk2/Phk3-Spy1-Mcs4) functions as a modulator to direct the extracellular MG signal to the Spc1-SAPK pathway, we determined the phosphorylation status of Spc1 in mutants lacking these proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, MG-induced phosphorylation did not occur in mcs4Δ cells, suggesting that the MG signal is sent to Mcs4 for activation of the SAPK pathway. Because Spy1 negatively regulates Mcs4, disruption of spy1+ enhanced the basal phosphorylation of Spc1. Intriguingly, further phosphorylation of Spc1 was observed in spy1Δ cells following the treatment with MG, suggesting that Spy1 is dispensable for the MG-evoked response regarding Spc1 phosphorylation. Similarly, the basal Spc1 phosphorylation level was increased in phk1Δphk2Δphk3Δ cells, because these histidine kinases negatively function as downstream modulators under normal conditions. Although the maximal level of phosphorylation was slightly lower than that attained in wild-type cells, Spc1 was further phosphorylated in phk1Δphk2Δphk3Δ cells following the treatment with MG.FIGURE 4MG stress signal converges to Mcs4. A, cells (WT, JY879; phk1Δphk2Δphk3Δ, PNN5; spy1Δ, PNN6; and mcs4Δ, PNN7) were cultured in YES medium until A595 = 0.8 at 28 °C, and 0.3 mm H2O2 or 10 mm MG was added to the culture. After 1 h, cells were collected, and Western blotting was performed. The density of each band was measured using densitometry, and the Spc1 phosphorylation level was shown as the ratio of the density of phosphorylated Spc1 to Spc1 protein. The Spc1 phosphorylation level in H2O2-treated wild-type cells was taken as 100. B, cells cultured in YES medium until A595 = 0.1 were diluted serially, and aliquots of cell suspension were spotted onto YES agar plates containing various concentrations of MG. Cells were cultured at 28 °C for 4 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we determined the susceptibility of mutants lacking these His-to-Asp phosphorelay proteins to MG (Fig. 4B). Spc1 phosphorylation was not observed in mcs4Δ cells, and consequently, the mcs4Δ mutant exhibited an increased sensitivity to MG. Meanwhile, the susceptibility to MG of the spy1Δ and phk1Δphk2Δphk3Δ mutants was comparable to that of the wild-type strain. Taken together, although Phk1, Phk2, and Phk3 partially function as the sensor kinase in MG stress response, these sensor kinases are likely not linked to Spy1 regarding the response, and consequently, another pathway may exist to direct the extracellular MG signal to Mcs4.MG Activates Pap1 in an Spc1-independent Fashion—Pap1 is a homologue of Yap1, and its activity is regulated at the nucleocytoplasmic localization step as is that of Yap1 (33Kudo N.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that Yap1 was concentrated in the nucleus upon the exposure of S. cerevisiae cells to MG (21Maeta K. Izawa S. Okazaki S. Kuge S. Inoue Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8753-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In MG-induced Yap1 activation, three Cys residues in the C terminus play crucial roles, and these residues are well conserved in Pap1 (33Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We determined whether Pap1 is also concentrated in the nucleus following the treatment with MG. Quinn et al. (40Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have reported that the nuclear localization of Pap1 in response to H2O2 is partially dependent upon Spc1, i.e. at lower concentrations of H2O2 (∼0.3 mm), Pap1 is accumulated in the nucleus irrespective of Spc1; however, at higher concentrations (>1 mm), the nuclear localization of Pap1 is dependent upon Spc1. As shown in Fig. 5, EGFP-tagged Pap1 was concentrated in the nucleus after 10 min of 0.3 mm H2O2 treatment even in spc1Δ cells. Similarly, Pap1 was accumulated in the nucleus in mcs4Δ cells following treatment with 0.3 mm H2O2. On the other hand, at 1 mm H2O2, Pap1 was not able to concentrate in the nuclei of spc1Δ and mcs4Δ cells. By contrast, Pap1 was accumulated in the nucleus after 10 min following treatment with 20 mm MG in the presence or absence of Spc1 or Mcs4. These results suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic localization of Pap1 is regulated irrespective of the Spc1-SAPK pathway and its upstream modulators.FIGURE 5Effect of MG on activation of Pap1. Cells (spc1Δ and mcs4Δ having the PR109 and JY879 background, respectively) carrying pR41FPap1 (EGFP-Pap1) were cultured in EMM medium until A595 = 0.2 at 28 °C, and chemicals at the concentrations indicated in the figure were added to the culture.

Cells with a non-cleavable UmuD exhibit essentially no UV-induced mutagenesis and are hypersensitive to killing by UV light. UmuD binds to the β processivity clamp (“β”) of the replicative DNA polymerase, pol III. A possible β-binding motif has been predicted in the same region of UmuD shown to be important for its interaction with β. We performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of this motif (14TFPLF18) in UmuD and found that it has a moderate influence on UV-induced mutagenesis but is required for the cold-sensitive phenotype caused by elevated levels of wild-type UmuD and UmuC. Surprisingly, the wild-type and the β-binding motif variant bind to β with similar Kd values as determined by changes in tryptophan fluorescence. However, these data also imply that the single tryptophan in β is in strikingly different environments in the presence of the wild-type versus the variant UmuD proteins, suggesting a distinct change in some aspect of the interaction with little change in its strength. Despite the fact that this novel UmuD variant is non-cleavable, we find that cells harboring it display phenotypes more consistent with the cleaved form UmuD′, such as resistance to killing by UV light and failure to exhibit the cold-sensitive phenotype. Cross-linking and chemical modification experiments indicate that the N-terminal arms of the UmuD variant are less likely to be bound to the globular domain than those of the wild-type, which may be the mechanism by which this UmuD variant acts as a UmuD′ mimic.

The umuDC gene products are induced as part of the SOS response and are responsible for much of the UV-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. Second Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2005Crossref Google Scholar). These gene products are subject to an elaborate set of controls that regulate their activity (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. Second Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2005Crossref Google Scholar). The LexA repressor provides transcriptional control, and there are several proteolytic controls on both the umuD and umuC gene products (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. Second Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2005Crossref Google Scholar). The homodimeric protein UmuD2 is the predominant species during the first about 20-30 min after SOS induction (2Opperman T. Murli S. Smith B.T. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9218-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). UmuD2, together with UmuC, plays a role in a DNA damage checkpoint, decreasing the rate of DNA synthesis and allowing time for accurate repair processes to act (2Opperman T. Murli S. Smith B.T. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9218-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This correlates with the cold-sensitive phenotype observed under conditions of overexpression of the umuDC gene products (2Opperman T. Murli S. Smith B.T. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9218-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 3Sutton M.D. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As the SOS response proceeds, UmuD2 binds the RecA/ssDNA 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; BMH, bis-maleimidohexane; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate). 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; BMH, bis-maleimidohexane; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate). nucleoprotein filament. This stimulates the latent ability of UmuD2 to convert to UmuD′2 by cleaving off its N-terminal 24 amino acids, resulting in UmuD′2 becoming the predominant species. The RecA/ssDNA nucleoprotein filament serves to bring together the active site dyad residues Ser60 and Lys97 facilitating deprotonation of Ser60 by Lys97 (4Ferentz A.E. Walker G.C. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4287-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The activated Ser nucleophile then cleaves the peptide bond between Cys24 and Gly25 of UmuD2 (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. Second Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2005Crossref Google Scholar).The wealth of structural data and models available for UmuD2 and UmuD′2 provide insight into how the two forms of the umuD gene products engage in multiple highly specific interactions (Fig. 1) (4Ferentz A.E.

Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12373-12378Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Of the two forms, UmuD2 interacts more strongly with the β processivity clamp (also referred to as β or the β clamp) than does UmuD′2 (9Sutton M.D. Opperman T. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12373-12378Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Sutton M.D. Narumi I. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5307-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In full-length UmuD2, the 39-amino acid N-terminal arms are stably bound to the globular C-terminal domain (4Ferentz A.E. Walker G.C. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4287-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Sutton M.D. Guzzo A. Narumi I. Costanzo M. Altenbach C. Ferentz A.E. Hubbell W.L. Walker G.C. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and form a distinct interaction surface. In the cleaved form of the protein, UmuD′2, the remaining approximately 15 amino acids at the N terminus appear unbound from the body of the protein and solvent-exposed (5Ferentz A.E. Opperman T. Walker G.C. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), revealing the buried portion of the C-terminal globular domain (4Ferentz A.E. Walker G.C. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4287-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Sutton M.D. Guzzo A. Narumi I. Costanzo M. Altenbach C. Ferentz A.E. Hubbell W.L. Walker G.C. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A series of truncations at the N-terminal arm of UmuD2 indicates that the first eight amino acids of UmuD2 are dispensable for the UmuD2-β interaction, whereas deleting residues 2-18 results in a substantial decrease in, but not a complete loss of, cross-linking efficiency with the β clamp (10Sutton M.D. Narumi I. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5307-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the umuD gene products interact with the β clamp via both the N-terminal arms of UmuD2 and the globular domain of UmuD2 and UmuD′2 (10Sutton M.D. Narumi I. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5307-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This differential interaction appears to control, at least in part, whether the umuDC gene products act as part of a DNA damage checkpoint or as a translesion polymerase (9Sutton M.D. Opperman T. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12373-12378Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Sutton M.D. Narumi I. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5307-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These interactions with the β clamp are of particular interest because sliding clamps play a key role in coordinating the multiple DNA polymerases present in cells (11Becherel O.J. Fuchs R.P. Wagner J. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Beuning P.J. Barsky D. Sawicka D. Walker G.C. Mol.

The eukaryotic DNA sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen interacts with multiple proteins. These interactions are in part regulated by covalent modification of proliferating cell nuclear antigen with monoubiquitin or the small ubiquitin-like modifier, (SUMO) which is distinct from the role of polyubiquitination in proteolytic degradation (16Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 17Gill G.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Duzen et al. (20Duzen J.M. Walker G.C. Sutton M.D. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have suggested that UmuD2 and UmuD′2 play conceptually similar roles in modulating the various clamp interactions.A version of the canonical β clamp binding motif found in eubacterial polymerases as well as other proteins involved in DNA metabolism was postulated to be present in UmuD at residues 14-18 (Fig. 2) (21Dalrymple B.P. Kongsuwan K. Wijffels G. Dixon N.E. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid experiment with the motif of UmuD showed, however, that these five amino acids are not sufficient for the interaction with the β clamp (21Dalrymple B.P. Kongsuwan K. Wijffels G. Dixon N.E. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Given the fact that this result was obtained utilizing only the five-amino acid motif in UmuD, and cross-linking experiments showed that the region of UmuD between residues 9 and 19 is important for interactions with the β clamp (10Sutton M.D. Narumi I. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5307-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we undertook a site-directed mutagenesis analysis of this motif. These studies led to the unexpected discovery of a new class of UmuD variant proteins that fail to undergo cleavage but whose properties resemble those of the cleaved version, UmuD′.FIGURE 2The β-binding motif variants do not eliminate UV-induced mutagenesis.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3370-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) for protein structure comparison and superposition and the AS2TS program (23Zemla A. C. E.Z. Slezak T. Kuczmarski T. Rama D. Torres C. Sawicka D. Barsky D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W111-W115Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for homology model building. An initial model of the UmuD monomer (single chain) was constructed based on the crystal structure of UmuD′ (Protein Data Bank code 1ay9, chain A) (24Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The missing N-terminal arm was modeled by the LGA loop building/grafting procedure (22Zemla A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3370-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), using mainly the arm conformation in 1jhh_A, from the x-ray crystallographic structure of LexA (25Luo Y. Pfuetzner R.A. Mosimann S. Paetzel M. Frey E.A. Cherney M. Kim B. Little J.W. Strynadka N.C.J. Cell. 2001; 106: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as well as the other LexA structures (1jhc, 1jhe, and 1jhf) as template structures to guide the local and overall conformation. In the final alignment (Fig. S1), UmuD Asp20 had to be inserted into the LexA template (between residues 80 and 81 of LexA), and this was done by the LGA loop building procedure (22Zemla A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3370-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Finally, residues 1-14 are in an extended conformation (i.e. we make no prediction as to the placement of these residues; they are only modeled in a formal sense).In creating the full UmuD homodimeric complex, we used LGA to superimpose our monomer model onto each of the template chains in the NMR structure of the UmuD′ homodimer (4Ferentz A.E. Walker G.C. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4287-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (1i4v, chains A and B, model 1), but some minor clashes occurred that were alleviated by following the LexA homodimer instead (25Luo Y. Pfuetzner R.A. Mosimann S. Paetzel M. Frey E.A. Cherney M. Kim B. Little J.W. Strynadka N.C.J. Cell. 2001; 106: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This procedure creates a cis (non-domain swapped) conformation of the UmuD homodimer. Because there is a very small “shoulder” region at the top of the arms, the trans UmuD homodimer model could be constructed from the cis UmuD homodimer model by swapping the arms as follows: the first 39 residues in chain A of our trans model were taken from the chain B of the cis model, and vice versa. This process of “arm swapping” was completed after applying the LGA loop building procedure to residues 39-41 in the shoulder regions. Finally, the LexA structures appear as both “elbows up” (N-terminal arm unbound) and “elbows down” (N-terminal arm bound to C-terminal domain), allowing us to model both conformations (Fig. S1). Thus, we created four models, two cis and two trans, each with an elbows up and an elbows down conformation (it is possible that heterogeneous conformations also occur with one elbow up and one elbow down as in the 1jhh LexA structure). For all the cis and trans models of the UmuD homodimer, the conformations of side chains from residues either not present in 1ay9_A or that presented a steric clash after building the dimeric structures were modeled using the side chain placement program SCWRL (26Bower M. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar).Proteins, Strains, and Plasmids—A plasmid expressing UmuD-3A was constructed in pSG5 using mutagenic primers and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) (27Beuning P.J.

Wild-type UmuD and UmuD-3A were purified according to the published procedure (27Beuning P.J. Simon S.M. Godoy V.G. Jarosz D.F. Walker G.C.

Briefly, cultures of GW8017 harboring various umuDC-expressing plasmids growing exponentially in LB were washed with 0.85% saline, exposed to 25 J/m2 UV light from a germicidal lamp (General Electric), and then plated on M9 minimal plates with trace arginine (1 μg/ml). Colony-forming units were scored after 48 h of growth at 42 °C. Survival was determined by plating on M9 minimal plates with 40 μg/ml arginine. Non-UV irradiated cultures were treated identically to assess the spontaneous mutation frequency. The data represent the average of at least three determinations.UV survival curves were obtained after treating cells suspended in 0.85% saline in a Petri dish with the indicated doses of 254-nm light. Each sample was serially diluted and the dilutions were plated on M9 minimal media plates supplemented with 1% casamino acids, 0.005% tryptophan, and 1.5% agar. Plates were incubated overnight at 42 °C.Quantitative Transformation Assays—Transformation assays were performed essentially as described (27Beuning P.J. Simon S.M. Godoy V.G. Jarosz D.F. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 318-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasmids (0.1 μg) were added to 25-50 μl of competent AB1157 cells and incubated on ice for 10 min. After a 5-min heat shock at 37 °C, and a further 10-min incubation on ice, transformation mixtures were allowed to recover in 750 μl of LB at 37 °C for 1.5 h with gentle shaking. Equal volumes were plated on LB plates containing the appropriate antibiotics for incubation under different temperatures as indicated in the figure legends.Immunoblots—To determine UmuD expression levels, cells were harvested from exponentially growing cultures in LB, lysed by boiling for 15 min, and loaded on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (Cambrex). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in 10 mm CAPS, pH 8, 10% methanol. After blocking, membranes were probed with anti-UmuD/D′, and antibody interactions were detected with SuperSignal substrate (Pierce). Antibodies to UmuD/D′ were raised against purified UmuD in rabbits (Immunodynamics, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For UV-induced expression and cleavage experiments, an aliquot of about 2.5 × 1010 cells from an exponentially growing culture at A600 = 0.2-0.3 was harvested, washed in 0.85% saline, and UV-irradiated at 25 J/m2. Irradiated cells were then transferred to LB and grown at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends.UmuD in Vitro Cleavage Assay—RecA/ssDNA nucleoprotein filament-facilitated UmuD cleavage was assayed (27Beuning P.J.

Reaction products were analyzed by 14% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The extent of UmuD cleavage was quantified using the Line Profile feature of the National Instruments Vision Assistant.Cross-linking and Chemical Modification—Cross-linking was performed essentially as described (32Lee M.H. Ohta T. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4825-4837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with bis-maleimidohexane (BMH, Pierce). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for the times indicated. For chemical modification with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) (33Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), DTNB was dissolved at 2 mm final concentration in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Reactions were performed with 10-20 μm DTNB and 10-20 μm UmuD proteins in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The concentration of accessible thiols was calculated with an extinction coefficient of 13,600 cm-1 m-1 at 412 nm. Several trials were performed, and representative data are shown.Fluorescence Determination of Binding Constants—Binding constants between UmuD and β were determined essentially as described, with a PT1 QM-20000-4SE spectrofluorimeter (Lawrenceville, NJ) (27Beuning P.J. Simon S.M. Godoy V.G. Jarosz D.F. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 318-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The β clamp has a single Trp (residue 122), whereas UmuD has none. The β2 concentration was constant at 2.5 μm. Emission from UmuD or UmuD-3A without β2 was subtracted from emission of the complex, and the center of the spectral mass was calculated for each [UmuD]. Excitation was at 278 nm, and emission was monitored from 300 to 400 nm. Excitation and emission path polarizers were oriented perpendicularly. The data represent the average of at least three independent experiments ± 1 S.D.RESULTSMutations in the “β-Binding Motif” of UmuD Do Not Result in Complete Loss of Induced Mutagenesis—We used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to make single alanine mutations in the putative β-binding motif in UmuD (Figs. 1 and 2) and investigated the consequences of these variants on known phenotypes of UmuD. These plasmid-borne variants were assayed for their ability to complement a ΔumuDC null strain for UV-induced mutagenesis. In addition to single alanine variants of UmuD, we constructed one variant with alanines at the first and last two positions in the motif (UmuD-3A, Fig. 2), the positions most conserved among all β-binding motifs (21Dalrymple B.P. Kongsuwan K. Wijffels G. Dixon N.E. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the case of UmuC, the analogous mutation in its β-binding motif results in a complete loss of UV-induced mutagenesis (11Becherel O.J. Fuchs R.P. Wagner J. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Beuning P.J. Barsky D. Sawicka D. Walker G.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 460-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). No single mutation or set of multiple mutations in this motif in UmuD failed completely to complement a ΔumuDC strain. However, plasmids expressing either the F18A UmuD variant, which is located at the top of the arm over the C-terminal globular domain, or the T14A/L17A/F18A (“UmuD-3A”) variant resulted in substantial decreases in induced mutagenesis, down to about 15-20% of the wild-type (Fig. 2). Curiously, this decrease in mutagenesis of cells harboring these variants was not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in survival after UV irradiation (Fig. 5); yet, typically, increased mutagenesis due to translesion synthesis by UmuD′2C is associated with increased survival after treatment with UV.FIGURE 5UV survival of UmuD variants. Assays were performed with pGY9739 plasmids and derivatives in GW8017 (ΔumuDC): pGY9738 (umuD′C,♦); pGY9739-F18A (umuDC F18A, •); pGY9739-D3A S60A (umuDC D3A/S60A, +); pGY9739-F18A/S60A (umuDC F18A/S60A, -); pGY9739-D3A (umuDC D3A, *); pGY9739 (umuDC, ▪); pGB2 (empty vector, ▴); and pGY9739-S60A (umuDC S60A, ×).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cleavage of the N-terminal 24 amino acids from the arm of UmuD to yield UmuD′ is required to activate UmuC for its role in translesion synthesis (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. Second Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2005Crossref Google Scholar). Because the UmuD arm harboring these mutations would be removed upon cleavage, we reasoned that the defect in induced mutagenesis of strains expressing the F18A and T14A/L17A/F18A (UmuD-3A) variant proteins might be because of defects in cleavage. Given their positions in the N-terminal arm (Fig. 1), it might be expected that these residues would play a role in properly positioning the arm in the active site for cleavage. We tested whether these mutations in the N-terminal arm of UmuD interfered with cleavage after UV exposure. The F15A and L17A mutants showed a slight decrease in cleavage and an ∼1.5-fold decrease in induced mutagenesis compared with the wild-type (Figs. 2 and 3 and data not shown). The two UmuD variants (F18A and UmuD-3A) that showed essentially no cleavage up to 3 h after UV exposure (Fig. 3), or even after 14 h (data not shown), resulted in a substantial but not complete reduction in induced mutagenesis (about 15-20% of wild-type). This is in contrast to non-cleavable UmuD active site variants that have been assayed previously, which showed essentially complete loss of induced mutagenesis (the limit of detection of this assay is about 1000-fold, or 0.1% of wild-type) (34Battista J.R.

Thus, there are two groups of non-cleavable UmuD variants, one that renders cells partially mutable and the other that renders cells essentially non-mutable.FIGURE 3UmuD variants are defective in cleavage.

To address this issue, we have examined the contributions of the histone H3 and H4 amino termini, and of the coactivator and histone acetyltransferase Gcn5p, to activation of a small group of Gcn4p-activated genes. The histone H3 tail exerts a modest (about 2-fold) but significant effect on activation that correlates with a requirement for Gcn5p and is distributed over multiple lysine residues. The H4 tail also plays a positive role in activation of some of those genes tested, but this does not correlate as closely with Gcn5p coactivation. Microarray experiments did not reveal a close correspondence between those genes activated by Gcn4p and genes requiring the H3 or H4 tail, and analysis of published microarray data indicates that Gcn4p-regulated genes are not in general strongly dependent on Gcn5p. However, a large fraction of genes activated by Gcn4p were found to be repressed by the H3 and H4 amino termini under non-inducing conditions, indicating that one role for Gcn4p is to overcome repression mediated by the histone tails.

Investigations into chromatin structure and function performed over the past decade have revealed that the association of DNA with histones in eukaryotes confers an added layer of regulatory complexity that has dwarfed expectations. Chromatin transactions are involved in transcription, replication, repair, and recombination, and a variety of cellular machinery contributes to these transactions by remodeling chromatin structure and/or post-translationally modifying the histones (1Peterson C.L. Laniel M.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Some post-translational modifications of the histones occur in the central, structured domains, but histone modifications are particularly concentrated in the highly conserved, unstructured amino termini, or “tails” (2Jaskelioff M. Peterson C.L. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The variety of modified sites and modifying enzymes has led to the proposition that a histone code specifies function via particular combinations of modifications (5Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

Those studies also revealed redundancy with regard to viability and GAL gene regulation among the modifiable lysine residues in the H3 and H4 amino termini, and more recent investigations have indicated that these lysines function redundantly in transcription on a genome-wide level in yeast (13Dion M.F.

Genetics. 2004; 167: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, other studies have indicated that particular amino acids in the histone amino termini can be critical for gene activation (15Agalioti T. Chen G. Thanos D. Cell. 2002; 111: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 16Lo W.S. Duggan L. Emre N.C. Belotserkovskya R. Lane W.S. Shiekhattar R. Berger S.L.

Laniel M.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). More recent reports have arrived at conflicting conclusions regarding the extent to which patterns of histone modifications specify transcriptional output versus the extent to which modifications function redundantly (18Kurdistani S.K. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Cell. 2004; 117: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 19Liu C.L. Kaplan T. Kim M. Buratowski S. Schreiber S.L. Friedman N. Rando O.J. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e328Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The first coactivator identified as a histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5p, when tested as a recombinant protein was found to target Lys-14 of histone H3 and Lys-8 and Lys-16 of histone H4 for acetylation when presented with purified histones, but to have little activity toward nucleosomal histones (20Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) (although under optimal buffer conditions, recombinant Gcn5p can acetylate histone H3 in reconstituted nucleosome arrays (21Tse C. Georgieva E.I. Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32388-32392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). In vivo, however, Gcn5p exists predominantly as a component of the SAGA and ADA complexes (22Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In vitro assays indicate that SAGA principally targets Lys-9, -14, and -18 of histone H3 for acetylation (23Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5895-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), whereas in vivo investigations revealed Lys-9 and -18 of H3 as important targets of Gcn5p but indicated that additional targets exist (24Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These results suggest that for genes requiring Gcn5p as a coactivator, specific lysine residues in histone H3, and possibly H4, could be important for transcriptional activation. However, Gcn5p-dependent activation of a reporter gene by the chimeric activator Gal4-VP16 was increased rather than diminished by point mutations examined in Lys-9 or Lys-14 of histone H3 or in the lysines of the H4 tail (24Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here, we have sought to obtain new insight into the roles of the H3 and H4 amino termini in transcriptional activation, with particular focus on the H3 tail, by focusing on a few genes that are activated by the general transcriptional activator Gcn4p and/or that require Gcn5p for full activation. We have tested how expression of these genes is affected by successively larger truncations of the H3 amino terminus, or by point mutation of specific lysine residues, to determine whether their activation depends on a specific region of the H3 tail, as the “histone code” hypothesis would suggest, or whether more delocalized effects might regulate gene expression. Gcn4p interacts with the SAGA complex in vitro (25Drysdale C.M. Jackson B.M. McVeigh R. Klebanow E.R. Bai Y. Kokubo T. Swanson M. Nakatani Y. Weil P.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Natarajan K. Jackson B.M. Rhee E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is capable of recruiting Gcn5p during gene activation in vivo (27Kuo M.-H. Vom Baur E. Struhl K. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1309-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28Syntichaki P. Topalidou I. Thireos G. Nature. 2000; 404: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This suggests that many of the large number of genes activated by Gcn4p (29Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) could depend on Gcn5p (26Natarajan K. Jackson B.M. Rhee E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and therefore could be expected to show significant dependence for their activation on the H3 and/or H4 tail. To test this idea, we examined genome-wide effects of the loss of the H3 or H4 amino terminus on transcription under conditions of amino acid starvation, in which most Gcn4p-regulated genes are active. In addition, we have used our own and other publicly available genome-wide expression data to examine the dependence of genes that bind Gcn5p on the histone H3 and H4 amino termini for expression. Our results suggest a modest dependence of Gcn5p-dependent genes on the H3 and H4 amino termini, but very little dependence of most Gcn4p-activated genes on the H3 and H4 tails for activation. However, we show that a large fraction of genes activated by Gcn4p are repressed by H3 and H4 amino termini under non-inducing conditions, indicating that one function of Gcn4p is to overcome chromatin-mediated repression that depends on the histone tails. Plasmids—Plasmid pMS308 was generated by cloning the HHT1-HHF1 fragment from pMS329, which contains a URA3 marker, into pMS358, which contains a LEU2 marker (8Morgan B.A. Mittman B.A. Smith M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4111-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To generate plasmids pCY318, pCY328, pCY338, and pCY348, which harbor the genes encoding histone H3(Δ1-20), H3(Δ1-15), H3(Δ1-10), and H3(Δ1-5) respectively, fragments encoding the corresponding histone H3 deletions were generated by PCR and cloned into pMS358 as SmaI-EcoRI fragments in place of the hht1-2 gene. All mutant hht1 genes were verified by sequencing. Plasmids pCY101, pCY102, pCY103, pCY201, pCY202, and pCY203 were generated by point mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by sequencing. Plasmid pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4 was created by cloning the SacI-PstI fragment of pAB71 2A. Bortvin, unpublished data. (30Yu L. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell.

Strains and Media—Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain LYY256 was constructed beginning with strain MX15-3B, generously provided by Prof. Mitch Smith (University of Virginia). MX15-3B is a meiotic segregant constructed by crossing MX4-22A (MATa ura3-52 lys2-Δ201 leu2-3,-112 Δ(HHT1 HHF1) Δ(HHT2 HHF2) pMS329(CEN4 ARS1 HHT1 HHF1 URA3)) (7Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Mittman B.A. Smith M.M. Science. 1990; 247: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) with a congenic strain derived from L3110 (gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2) (31Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and dissecting tetrads. The histone deletion loci were confirmed by dependence on pMS329 and Southern blot analysis, and the gcn4, bas1-2, and bas2-2 alleles were confirmed by tetrad analysis, growth requirements, and complementation analysis (31Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The plasmid pMS358, a LEU2 marked plasmid that encodes histone H3 lacking the amino-terminal 28 amino acids, was transformed into MX15-3B. Leu+ transformants were selected, and the URA3-marked plasmid expressing wild-type histone H3 was shuttled out by selection on complete synthetic medium (CSM) 3The abbreviations used are: CSM, complete synthetic dropout medium; FDR, false discovery rates; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole. -Leu plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. The loss of the plasmid was confirmed by PCR using primers specific for H3(Δ1-28). The new strain (hht1, hht2, bas1, bas2, gcn4, HIS4, [pHHF1-hht1(Δ1-28) LEU2]) was mated with LYY599 (30Yu L. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5279-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Diploids were selected on CSM-Ura-Leu plates and tested for inability to mate with haploid tester strains. After random sporulation, haploids carrying only the hht1-2 (H3(Δ1-28)) gene and containing the wild-type HIS4 promoter were identified by PCR. LYY256 was then constructed by introducing wild-type histone H3 expression plasmid pMS329 into this strain and shuttling out pMS358. Finally, pAB71 or pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4 was introduced into these strains to express Gcn4p.TABLE 1Yeast strainsStrainGenotype or descriptionRef.LYY256MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pMS329 [CEN ARS URA3 HHT1-HHF1] pAB71 [LEU2 DED 1pr-GCN4]This workCYY356MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY318 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1 (Δ1-20)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY456MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY328 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1 (Δ1-15)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY556MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY338 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1 (Δ1-10)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY656MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY348 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1 (Δ1-5)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY756MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY358 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1H3 (K4,9,14,18,23,27Q)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workNSY429MA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pNS329 [CEN ARS TRP1 HHT1-HHF1]36NSY438MA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pNS338 [CEN ARS TRP1 HHT1-hhf1-8(H4Δ2-26)]36MX1-4CMA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pMS329 [CEN ARS URA3 HHT1-HHF1]8CY1-4CMA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pMS308 [CEN ARS LEU2 HHT1-HHF1]This workCY2-4CMA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pMS358 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1-2(Δ1-28)-HHF1]This workCY3-4CMA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pCY318 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1(Δ1-20)-HHF1]This workCY4-4CMA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pCY328 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1(Δ1-15)-HHF1]This workCY5-4CMA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pCY338 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1(Δ1-10)-HHF1]This workCY6-4CMA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pCY348 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1(Δ1-5)-HHF1]This workCLY460MA Tαura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3, 112 trp1-289 his3Δ1 Δ(hht1-hhf1)(hht2-hhf2) pCL460 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1-3(K4,9,14,18,23,27Q)-HHF1]44CYY101MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY101 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1H3(K4Q)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY201MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY201 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1H3(K4R)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY102MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY102 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1H3(K14Q)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY202MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY202 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1H3(K14R)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY103MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY103 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1H3(K18Q)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This workCYY203MA Ta ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 gcn4-2 bas1-2 bas2-2 Δ(HHT2-HHF2) pCY203 [CEN ARS LEU2 hht1H3(K18R)-HHF1] pRS416-DED1pr-GCN4This work Open table in a new tab The LYY256 and MX1-4C derivative strains were generated by plasmid shuffling. Genes encoding histone mutants were amplified by PCR from the resulting yeast strains and verified by sequencing. The gcn5Δ strain CY8-4C was constructed by transforming CY1-4C with a PCR fragment obtained by amplifying gcn5::KanMx and flanking sequences from the corresponding yeast deletion collection strain (32Giaever G.

Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic dropout medium (CSM-) (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and CSM dropout mixture (Bio101)). 5-Fluoroorotic acid was used at 1 g/liter with addition of 50 mg/liter uracil. Rich medium (YPD) contained 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose. Yeast transformations were performed using a standard lithium acetate method (33Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Donald G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Northern Analysis—RNA was prepared from log phase cultures by the hot phenol method (34Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (35Tsang S.S. Yin X. Guzzo-Arkuran C. Jones V.S. Davison A.J. Bio-Techniques. 1993; 14: 380-381Google Scholar) and blots were hybridized using probes produced by random primer labeling. Prior to reprobing, Northern membranes were stripped by rinsing 2-4 min in near boiling solution with 15 mm NaCl, 0.1× SSC, 1% SDS. Northern blots were scanned on a Amersham Biosciences Phosphorimager and quantitated using ImageQuant. The XhoI-XbaI fragment of pDN42 (a gift of Dr. D. Nag) containing most of the HIS4 sequence was used as the HIS4 Northern probe. The BglII fragment of pGEM-PYK1 was used as the PYK1 Northern probe (a gift from Dr. J. Curcio). The Northern probes for HIS3, HOM2, LYS1, ARG1, TRP2, and SAM2 were generated by PCR (primer sequences available upon request). Transcript levels were normalized to PYK1 mRNA. For normalization across a set of samples (e.g. from the series of histone H3 mutants in Fig. 1, A and B), the transcript levels (normalized to PYK1) were summed for each experiment (e.g. HIS3/PYK1 values for wild-type, H3Δ1-5, etc. were summed for experiment 1, where transcript levels from each yeast strain were measured on the same Northern blot) and the sums were set to the same arbitrary value for each experiment. The renormalized values thus obtained for each individual transcript were then used to obtain averages and standard deviations for each transcript as shown in the figures. Microarray Analysis and Computational Methods—RNA was prepared from exponentially growing yeast cultured in CSM dropout medium using the Masterpure Yeast RNA purification kit (Epicenter Technology, Madison, WI). RNA was further purified using the RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen). Processing and hybridization to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) S98 microarrays were done according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (36Sabet N. Tong F. Madigan J.P. Volo S. Smith M.M. Morse R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4084-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Changes in gene expression were derived by averaging log2 expression changes. False discovery rates (FDRs) were derived according to Storey (37Storey J.D. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 2002; 64: 479-498Crossref Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). p Values for overlaps were derived using a hypergeometric distribution. Comparative analysis and clustering were done using Excel (Microsoft), Genetraffic (Iobion Informatics), and Genespring (Affymetrix). Enrichment of gene sets in specific functional categories, as defined by the MIPS data base (38Mewes H.W. Frishman D. Guldener U. Mannhaupt G. Mayer K. Mokrejs M. Morgenstern B. Munsterkotter M. Rudd S. Weil B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), was determined using FunSpec (39Robinson M.D. Grigull J. Mohammad N. Hughes T.R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To search for Gcn4p binding sites in a defined group of gene promoters, a Gcn4p motif model was generated. From the literature and the S. cerevisiae Promoter Data base (40Zhu J. Zhang M.Q. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), 27 experimentally identified Gcn4p binding sites were collected and aligned using the Gibbs Recursive Sampler (41Thompson W. Rouchka E.C. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This model was used with dscan (42Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lawrence C.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1618-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), which implements the method described by Staden (43Staden R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 89-96PubMed Google Scholar) to report sites that match the model at a chosen level of statistical significance. Microarray Accession Number—Microarray gene expression data are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE4135. Effects of Histone H3 Amino-terminal Deletions and Lys to Gln Mutation on Transcriptional Activation of Selected Genes—To examine the role of the histone H3 amino terminus in transcriptional activation, we constructed a series of yeast strains having deletions of the first 5, 10, 15, or 20 amino acids of histone H3. We then used these strains, together with previously described strains (44Sabet N. Volo S. Yu C. Madigan J.P. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8823-8833Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) lacking the first 28 amino acids of histone H3 or having the 6 lysine residues replaced by glutamines (Lys to Gln mutant), and the corresponding wild-type strains (Table 1), to analyze the levels of six Gcn4p-dependent transcripts (HIS4, HOM2, LYS1, HIS3, ARG1, and TRP2) and one control transcript (SAM2) that does not show Gcn4p dependence (29Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Based on microarray data from the Hinnebusch laboratory (29Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), these transcripts show from 3- to 15-fold induction after treatment with 100 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), and their induced levels of transcripts are reduced 6-19-fold in gcn4Δ yeast (Table 2). A lower (10 mm) concentration of 3-AT results in 4.5-20-fold induction, with the exception of TRP2, which is not induced. We confirmed the Gcn4p dependence of these genes in one of the two strains (both derived from strain S288C) used here, and found results generally consistent with those obtained by the Hinnebusch laboratory (29Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), although we did observe a modest dependence of SAM2 expression on Gcn4p not found previously (Table 2). After this work was underway, a genome-wide location analysis study yielded data indicating that five of the GCN4-dependent transcripts examined here (HIS4, LYS1, HIS3, ARG1, and TRP2) are indeed direct targets of Gcn4p (having p values for Gcn4p association of <2 × 10-4, where 1 × 10-3 is judged to be significant), whereas binding of Gcn4p to the HOM2 (and SAM2) promoter was not observed (29Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). HOM2 may therefore be indirectly regulated by Gcn4p.TABLE 2Dependence on GCN4 and induction by 3AT of genes examined in this workGeneGCN4+/gcn4-aFrom Natarajan et al.

Open table in a new tab We chose to examine Gcn4p-dependent transcripts because a large number of genes are regulated by this well studied transcriptional activator, and considerable knowledge exists regarding Gcn4p-mediated transcriptional activation (29Natarajan K.

Cell. 1999; 4: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gcn4p-mediated gene activation often depends on Gcn5p, a histone acetyltransferase that functions as a coactivator as a member of the SAGA complex (47Georgakopoulos T. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 48Qiu H. Hu C. Yoon S. Natarajan K. Swanson M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

Because Gcn5p targets the histone H3 amino terminus (51Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar), we reasoned that genes activated by Gcn4p might show reduced activation upon loss of specific residues in the histone H3 tail. In principle, the same question might be addressed more directly by epistasis analysis; however, deletion of the H3 or H4 amino termini is lethal when combined with GCN5 deletion (24Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), making this approach untenable. Yeast strains were grown in CSM lacking uracil and leucine, and mRNA was prepared. Experiments were performed using derivatives of two distinct parent strains. One (LYY256) was transformed"
