https://openalex.org/W2036847748,"Imaging lipid composition Chemical imaging of cell membranes can be performed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI), but low ionization efficiency often leads to a signal dominated by the main lipid components, such as abundant phosphatidylcholine species. Soltwisch et al. used a tunable laser for post-ionization of neutral species to boost the signal for other membrane components, such as cholesterol and phospho- and glycolipids. Imaging of cells and tissues with these methods allows differentiation based on a more extensive chemical signature. Science , this issue p. 211"

Infrared maps of water isotopes made by Villanueva et al. show the distribution of H 2 O and “semiheavy” water (HDO: deuterated water containing a mixture of hydrogen isotopes) across Mars. HDO enrichment varies with time and location; for example, irregular isotopic signals associate with different terrain features. The measurements also allow seasonal sublimation levels of the northern ice cap to be estimated and thus could be used to reveal past climate behavior. Science , this issue p. 218"
https://openalex.org/W2036043979,"Immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, recognize transformed cells and eliminate them in a process termed immunosurveillance. It is thought that tumor cells evade immunosurveillance by shedding membrane ligands that bind to the NKG2D-activating receptor on NK cells and/or T cells, and desensitize these cells. In contrast, we show that in mice, a shed form of MULT1, a high-affinity NKG2D ligand, causes NK cell activation and tumor rejection. Recombinant soluble MULT1 stimulated tumor rejection in mice. Soluble MULT1 functions, at least in part, by competitively reversing a global desensitization of NK cells imposed by engagement of membrane NKG2D ligands on tumor-associated cells, such as myeloid cells. The results overturn conventional wisdom that soluble ligands are always inhibitory and suggest a new approach for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1963619040,"What controls clumped isotopes? Stable isotopes of a molecule can clump together in several combinations, depending on their mass. Even for simple molecules such as O 2 , which can contain 16 O, 17 O, and 18 O in various combinations, clumped isotopes can potentially reveal the temperatures at which molecules form. Away from equilibrium, however, the pattern of clumped isotopes may reflect a complex array of processes. Using high-resolution gas-phase mass spectrometry, Yeung et al. found that biological factors influence the clumped isotope signature of oxygen produced during photosynthesis (see the Perspective by Passey). Similarly, Wang et al. showed that away from equilibrium, kinetic effects causing isotope clumping can lead to overestimation of the temperature at which microbially produced methane forms.

In this study, the cDNA (FhCHS1) encoding CHS from Freesia hybrida was successfully isolated and analyzed. Multiple sequence alignments showed that both the conserved CHS active site residues and CHS signature sequence were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of FhCHS1. Meanwhile, crystallographic analysis revealed that protein structure of FhCHS1 is highly similar to that of alfalfa CHS2, and the biochemical analysis results indicated that it has an enzymatic role in naringenin biosynthesis. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the transcript levels of FhCHS1 in flowers and different tissues, and patterns of FhCHS1 expression in flowers showed significant correlation to the accumulation patterns of anthocyanin during flower development. To further characterize the functionality of FhCHS1, its ectopic expression in Arabidopsis thaliana tt4 mutants and Petunia hybrida was performed. The results showed that overexpression of FhCHS1 in tt4 mutants fully restored the pigmentation phenotype of the seed coats, cotyledons and hypocotyls, while transgenic petunia expressing FhCHS1 showed flower color alteration from white to pink. In summary, these results suggest that FhCHS1 plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of flavonoid in Freesia hybrida and may be used to modify the components of flavonoids in other plants."
https://openalex.org/W2319566844,"Doxorubicin (Dox) is a highly effective antineoplastic drug. However, Dox-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes leads to irreversible degenerative cardiomyopathy, which limits Dox clinical application. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, has been shown to protect against oxidative damage in liver, heart and brain tissues in rodents. In current study, we investigated possible protective effects of Sch B against Dox-induced cardiomyopathy in mice. Mice received a single injection of Dox (20 mg/kg IP). Five days after Dox administration, left ventricular (LV) performance was significantly depressed and was improved by Sch B treatment. Sch B prevented the Dox-induced increase in lipid peroxidation, nitrotyrosine formation, and metalloproteinase activation in the heart. In addition, the increased expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-MAPK activated mitogen kinase 2 levels by Dox were significantly suppressed by Sch B treatment. Sch B also attenuated Dox-induced higher expression of LV proinflammatory cytokines, cardiomyocyte DNA damage, myocardial apoptosis, caspase-3 positive cells and phopho-p53 levels in mice. Moreover, LV expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and reactive oxygen species were significantly less in Sch B treatment mice after Dox injection. These findings suggest that Sch B attenuates Dox-induced cardiotoxicity via antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects."

https://openalex.org/W2008207747,"The auxin influx carriers auxin resistant 1/like aux 1 (AUX/LAX), efflux carriers pin-formed (PIN) (together with PIN-like proteins) and efflux/conditional P-glycoprotein (ABCB) are major protein families involved in auxin polar transport. However, how they function in responses to exogenous auxin and abiotic stresses in maize is largely unknown. In this work, the latest updated maize (Zea mays L.) reference genome sequence was used to characterize and analyze the ZmLAX, ZmPIN, ZmPILS and ZmABCB family genes from maize. The results showed that five ZmLAXs, fifteen ZmPINs, nine ZmPILSs and thirty-five ZmABCBs were mapped on all ten maize chromosomes. Highly diversified gene structures, nonconservative transmembrane helices and tissue-specific expression patterns suggested the possibility of function diversification for these genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression patterns of ZmLAX, ZmPIN, ZmPILS and ZmABCB genes under exogenous auxin and different environmental stresses. The expression levels of most ZmPIN, ZmPILS, ZmLAX and ZmABCB genes were induced in shoots and were reduced in roots by various abiotic stresses (drought, salt and cold stresses). The opposite expression response patterns indicated the dynamic auxin transport between shoots and roots under abiotic stresses. Analysis of the expression patterns of ZmPIN, ZmPILS, ZmLAX and ZmABCB genes under drought, salt and cold treatment may help us to understand the possible roles of maize auxin transporter genes in responses and tolerance to environmental stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2018039502,"Here, we describe the metagenome and functional composition of a microbial community in a historically metal-contaminated tropical freshwater stream sediment. The sediment was collected from the Mina Stream located in the Iron Quadrangle (Brazil), one of the world’s largest mining regions. Environmental DNA was extracted and was sequenced using SOLiD technology, and a total of 7.9 Gbp was produced. A taxonomic profile that was obtained by comparison to the Greengenes database revealed a complex microbial community with a dominance of Proteobacteria and Parvarcheota. Contigs were recruited by bacterial and archaeal genomes, especially Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii and Nitrosopumilus maritimus, and their presence implicated them in the process of N cycling in the Mina Stream sediment (MSS). Functional reconstruction revealed a large, diverse set of genes for ammonium assimilation and ammonification. These processes have been implicated in the maintenance of the N cycle and the health of the sediment. SEED subsystems functional annotation unveiled a high degree of diversity of metal resistance genes, suggesting that the prokaryotic community is adapted to metal contamination. Furthermore, a high metabolic diversity was detected in the MSS, suggesting that the historical arsenic contamination is no longer affecting the prokaryotic community. These results expand the current knowledge of the microbial taxonomic and functional composition of tropical metal-contaminated freshwater sediments."
https://openalex.org/W1965197845,"Although bone regeneration is typically a reliable process, type 2 diabetes is associated with impaired or delayed healing processes. In addition, angiogenesis, a crucial step in bone regeneration, is often altered in the diabetic state. In this study, different stages of bone regeneration were characterized in an unicortical bone defect model comparing transgenic type 2 diabetic (db-/db-) and wild type (WT) mice in vivo. We investigated angiogenesis, callus formation and bone remodeling at early, intermediate and late time points by means of histomorphometry as well as protein level analyses. In order to enhance bone regeneration, defects were locally treated with recombinant FGF-9 or VEGFA. Histomorphometry of aniline blue stained sections indicated that bone regeneration is significantly decreased in db-/db- as opposed to WT mice at intermediate (5 days post operation) and late stages (7 days post operation) of bone regeneration. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly decreased levels of RUNX-2, PCNA, Osteocalcin and PECAM-1 in db-/db- defects. In addition, osteoclastogenesis is impaired in db-/db- indicating altered bone remodeling. These results indicate significant impairments in angiogenesis and osteogenesis in type 2 diabetic bones. Importantly, angiogenesis, osteogenesis and bone remodeling could be reconstituted by application of recombinant FGF-9 and, in part, by VEGFA application. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that type 2 diabetes affects angiogenesis, osteogenesis and subsequently bone remodeling, which in turn leads to decreased bone regeneration. These effects could be reversed by local application of FGF-9 and to a lesser degree VEGFA. These data could serve as a basis for future therapeutic applications aiming at improving bone regeneration in the type 2 diabetic patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2040087293,"Dietary methionine restriction (MR) by 80% increases energy expenditure (EE), reduces adiposity, and improves insulin sensitivity. We propose that the MR-induced increase in EE limits fat deposition by increasing sympathetic nervous system-dependent remodeling of white adipose tissue and increasing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in both white and brown adipose tissue. In independent assessments of the role of UCP1 as a mediator of MR's effects on EE and insulin sensitivity, EE did not differ between wild-type (WT) and Ucp1(-/-) mice on the control diet, but MR increased EE by 31% and reduced adiposity by 25% in WT mice. In contrast, MR failed to increase EE or reduce adiposity in Ucp1(-/-) mice. However, MR was able to increase overall insulin sensitivity by 2.2-fold in both genotypes. Housing temperatures used to minimize (28°C) or increase (23°C) sympathetic nervous system activity revealed temperature-independent effects of the diet on EE. Metabolomics analysis showed that genotypic and dietary effects on white adipose tissue remodeling resulted in profound increases in fatty acid metabolism within this tissue. These findings establish that UCP1 is required for the MR-induced increase in EE but not insulin sensitivity and suggest that diet-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity are not strictly derived from dietary effects on energy balance."

So far a comprehensive description of the prenatal in vivo morphology of these functionally important pathways is lacking. In the present study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography were used to visualize major association fiber tracts and the fornix in utero in preselected non-motion degraded DTI datasets of 24 living unsedated fetuses between 20 and 34 gestational weeks (GW). The uncinate fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were depicted as early as 20 GW, while in vivo 3D visualization of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum and fornix was successful in older fetuses during the third trimester. Provided optimal scanning conditions, in utero DTI and tractography have the potential to provide a more accurate anatomical definition of developing neuronal networks in the human fetal brain. Knowledge about the normal prenatal 3D association tract morphology may serve as reference for their assessment in common developmental diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2077832351,"MicroRNAs can function as key tumor suppressors or oncogenes and act as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Although high-throughput assays have revealed many miRNA biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), only a few have been validated in independent populations or investigated for functional significance in PDAC pathogenesis. In this study, we correlated the expression of 36 potentially prognostic miRNAs within PDAC tissue with clinico-pathological features and survival in 151 Chinese patients. We then analyzed the functional roles and target genes of two miRNAs in PDAC development. We found that high expression of miR-186 and miR-326 predict poor and improved survival, respectively. miR-186 was over-expressed in PDAC patients compared with controls, especially in patients with large tumors (>2 cm), lymph node metastasis, or short-term survival (< 24 months). In contrast, miR-326 was down-regulated in patients compared with controls and displayed relatively increased expression in the patients with long-term survival or without venous invasion. Functional experiments revealed that PDAC cell proliferation and migration was decreased following inhibition and enhanced following over-expression of miR-186. In contrast, it was enhanced following inhibition and decreased after over-expression of miR-326. A luciferase assay indicated that miR-186 can bind directly to the 3′-UTR of NR5A2 to repress gene expression. These findings suggest that miR-186 over-expression contributes to the invasive potential of PDAC, likely via suppression of NR5A2, thereby leading to a poor prognosis; high miR-326 expression prolongs survival likely via the decreasing invasive potential of PDAC cells. These two miRNAs can be used as markers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis, and they represent therapeutic targets for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2036262174,"The isotope signatures registered in speleothems during tropical cyclones (TC) provides information about the frequency and intensity of past TCs but the precise relationship between isotopic composition and the meteorology of TCs remain uncertain. Here we present continuous δ18O and δ2H data in rainfall and water vapour, as well as in discrete rainfall samples, during the passage of TC Ita and relate the evolution in isotopic compositions to local and synoptic scale meteorological observations. High-resolution data revealed a close relationship between isotopic compositions and cyclonic features such as spiral rainbands, periods of stratiform rainfall and the arrival of subtropical and tropical air masses with changing oceanic and continental moisture sources. The isotopic compositions in discrete rainfall samples were remarkably constant along the ~450 km overland path of the cyclone when taking into account the direction and distance to the eye of the cyclone at each sampling time. Near simultaneous variations in δ18O and δ2H values in rainfall and vapour and a near-equilibrium rainfall-vapour isotope fractionation indicates strong isotopic exchange between rainfall and surface inflow of vapour during the approach of the cyclone. In contrast, after the passage of spiral rainbands close to the eye of the cyclone, different moisture sources for rainfall and vapour are reflected in diverging d-excess values. High-resolution isotope studies of modern TCs refine the interpretation of stable isotope signatures found in speleothems and other paleo archives and should aim to further investigate the influence of cyclone intensity and longevity on the isotopic composition of associated rainfall."
https://openalex.org/W2039736682,"The experience of post-amputation pain such as phantom limb pain (PLP) and residual limb pain (RLP), is a common consequence of limb amputation, and its presence has negative effects on a person’s well-being. The continuity hypothesis of dreams suggests that the presence of such aversive experiences in the waking state should be reflected in dream content, with the recalled body representation reflecting a cognitive proxy of negative impact. In the present study, we epidemiologically assessed the presence of post-amputation pain and other amputation-related information as well as recalled body representation in dreams in a sample of 3,234 unilateral limb amputees. Data on the site and time of amputation, residual limb length, prosthesis use, lifetime prevalence of mental disorders, presence of post-amputation pain, and presence of non-painful phantom phenomena were included in logistic regression analyses using recalled body representation in dreams (impaired, intact, no memory) as dependent variable. The effects of age, sex, and frequency of dream recall were controlled for. About 22% of the subjects indicated that they were not able to remember their body representation in dreams, another 24% of the amputees recalled themselves as always intact, and only a minority of less than 3% recalled themselves as always impaired. Almost 35% of the amputees dreamed of themselves in a mixed fashion. We found that lower-limb amputation as well as the presence of PLP and RLP was positively associated with the recall of an impaired body representation in dreams. The presence of non-painful phantom phenomena, however, had no influence. These results complement previous findings and indicate complex interactions of physical body appearance and mental body representation, probably modulated by distress in the waking state. The findings are discussed against the background of alterations in cognitive processes after amputation and hypotheses suggesting an innate body model."

https://openalex.org/W2090911691,"Toxicity of selenomethionine, an organic derivative of selenium widely used as supplement in human diets, was studied in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several DNA repair-deficient strains hypersensitive to selenide displayed wild-type growth rate properties in the presence of selenomethionine indicating that selenide and selenomethionine exert their toxicity via distinct mechanisms. Cytotoxicity of selenomethionine decreased when the extracellular concentration of methionine or S-adenosylmethionine was increased. This protection resulted from competition between the S- and Se-compounds along the downstream metabolic pathways inside the cell. By comparing the sensitivity to selenomethionine of mutants impaired in the sulfur amino acid pathway, we excluded a toxic effect of Se-adenosylmethionine, Se-adenosylhomocysteine, or of any compound in the methionine salvage pathway. Instead, we found that selenomethionine toxicity is mediated by the trans-sulfuration pathway amino acids selenohomocysteine and/or selenocysteine. Involvement of superoxide radicals in selenomethionine toxicity in vivo is suggested by the hypersensitivity of a Δsod1 mutant strain, increased resistance afforded by the superoxide scavenger manganese, and inactivation of aconitase. In parallel, we showed that, in vitro, the complete oxidation of the selenol function of selenocysteine or selenohomocysteine by dioxygen is achieved within a few minutes at neutral pH and produces superoxide radicals. These results establish a link between superoxide production and trans-sulfuration pathway seleno-amino acids and emphasize the importance of the selenol function in the mechanism of organic selenium toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2031758113,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when misfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER. A cell responds to ER stress with the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex program of transcriptional and translational changes aimed at clearing misfolded proteins. Secretory tissues and cells are particularly well adapted to respond to ER stress because their function requires high protein production and secretory load. The insect male accessory gland (AG) is a secretory tissue involved in male fertility. The AG secretes many seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) essential for male reproduction. Among adult Drosophila tissues, we find that genes upregulated by ER stress are most highly expressed in the AG, suggesting that the AG is already undergoing high levels of ER stress due to its normal secretory functions. We hypothesized that induction of excessive ER stress in the AG above basal levels, would perturb normal function and provide a genetic tool for studying AG and SFP biology. To test this, we genetically induced excessive ER stress in the AG by conditional 1) expression of a misfolded protein or 2) knockdown of the UPR regulatory protein, BiP. Both genetic manipulations induced excessive ER stress in the AG, as indicated by the increase in Xbp1 splicing, a marker of ER stress. Both models resulted in a large decrease in or loss of SFP production and male infertility. Sperm production, motility, and transfer appeared unaffected. The induction of strong ER stress in the insect male AG may provide a simple way for studying or manipulating male fertility, as it eliminates AG function while preserving sperm production."
https://openalex.org/W1973436365,"During the last 20 years multiple roles of the nitric oxide gas (•NO) have been uncovered in plant growth, development and many physiological processes. In seed plants the enzymatic synthesis of •NO is mediated by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like activity performed by a still unknown enzyme(s) and nitrate reductase (NR). In green algae the •NO production has been linked only to NR activity, although a NOS gene was reported for Ostreococcus tauri and O. lucimarinus, no other Viridiplantae species has such gene. As there is no information about •NO synthesis neither for non-vascular plants nor for non-seed vascular plants, the interesting question regarding the evolution of the enzymatic •NO production systems during land plant natural history remains open. To address this issue the endogenous •NO production by protonema was demonstrated using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). The •NO signal was almost eliminated in plants treated with sodium tungstate, which also reduced the NR activity, demonstrating that in P. patens NR activity is the main source for •NO production. The analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed endogenous NO production and showed that •NO signal is accumulated in the cytoplasm of protonema cells. The results presented here show for the first time the •NO production in a non-vascular plant and demonstrate that the NR-dependent enzymatic synthesis of •NO is common for embryophytes and green algae."

Plasma and urinary creatinine and urinary osmolality as well as plasma levels of plasma renin activity (PRA), Aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured. The plasma volume loss (PVL) was estimated from plasma density and hematocrit. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured based on nocturnal (9 hour) creatinine clearance; this was compared with various methods for estimation of GFR.The mean 24-hour urine production increased significantly in both sexes across the expedition. But PVL reached significance only in males. No changes in Na+ in plasma, urine or its fractional excretion were seen at both altitudes. Urinary osmolality decreased upon ascent to the higher altitudes. ADH and PRA decreased significantly at both altitudes in males but only at HA2 in females. However, no changes in aldosterone were seen across the sexes and at different altitudes. ANP increased significantly only in males during the expedition. GFR, derived from 9-h creatinine clearance (CreaCl), decreased in both sexes at HA1 but remained stable at HA2. Conventional Crea[p]-based GFR estimates (eGFR) showed only poor correlation to CreaCl.We report details of changes in hormonal patterns across high altitude sojourn. To our knowledge we are not aware of any study that has examined these hormones in same subjects and across gender during high altitude sojourn. Our results also suggest that depending on the estimation formula used, eGFR underestimated the observed decrease in renal function measured by CreaCl, thus opening the debate regarding the use of estimated glomerular filtration rates at high altitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2068705441,"Background and Purpose Imaging the optic radiation (OR) is of considerable interest in studying diseases affecting the visual pathway and for pre-surgical planning of temporal lobe resections. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical feasibility of using probabilistic diffusion tractography based on constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) to image the optic radiation. It was hypothesized that CSD would provide improved tracking of the OR compared with the widely used ball-and-stick model. Methods Diffusion weighted MRI (30 directions) was performed on twenty patients with no known visual deficits. Tractography was performed using probabilistic algorithms based on fiber orientation distribution models of local white matter trajectories. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated by comparing computational times and receiver operating characteristic results, and by correlation of anatomical landmark distances to dissection estimates. Results The results showed that it was consistently feasible to reconstruct individual optic radiations from clinically practical (4.5 minute acquisition) diffusion weighted imaging data sets using CSD. Tractography based on the CSD model resulted in significantly shorter computational times, improved receiver operating characteristic results, and shorter Meyer’s loop to temporal pole distances (in closer agreement with dissection studies) when compared to the ball-and-stick based algorithm. Conclusions Accurate tractography of the optic radiation can be accomplished using diffusion MRI data collected within a clinically practical timeframe. CSD based tractography was faster, more accurate and had better correlation with known anatomical landmarks than ball-and-stick tractography."
https://openalex.org/W1975831826,"Transcellular Cl− movement across acinar cells is the rate-limiting step for salivary gland fluid secretion. Basolateral Nkcc1 Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters play a critical role in fluid secretion by promoting the intracellular accumulation of Cl− above its equilibrium potential. However, salivation is only partially abolished in the absence of Nkcc1 cotransporter activity, suggesting that another Cl− uptake pathway concentrates Cl− ions in acinar cells. To identify alternative molecular mechanisms, we studied mice lacking Ae2 and Ae4 Cl−/HCO3− exchangers. We found that salivation stimulated by muscarinic and β-adrenergic receptor agonists was normal in the submandibular glands of Ae2−/− mice. In contrast, saliva secretion was reduced by 35% in Ae4−/− mice. The decrease in salivation was not related to loss of Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter or Na+/H+ exchanger activity in Ae4−/− mice but correlated with reduced Cl− uptake during β-adrenergic receptor activation of cAMP signaling. Direct measurements of Cl−/HCO3− exchanger activity revealed that HCO3−-dependent Cl− uptake was reduced in the acinar cells of Ae2−/− and Ae4−/− mice. Moreover, Cl−/HCO3− exchanger activity was nearly abolished in double Ae4/Ae2 knock-out mice, suggesting that most of the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger activity in submandibular acinar cells depends on Ae2 and Ae4 expression. In conclusion, both Ae2 and Ae4 anion exchangers are functionally expressed in submandibular acinar cells; however, only Ae4 expression appears to be important for cAMP-dependent regulation of fluid secretion.

Regulation of electrolyte and fluid secretion in salivary acinar cells.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G823-G837PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of Nkcc1 produces a dramatic 65% reduction in saliva secretion by the mouse parotid gland, demonstrating that Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter 1 (Nkcc1) is the main mechanism for concentrating Cl− in acinar cells (11Evans R.L. Park K. Turner R.J. Watson G.E. Nguyen H.V. Dennett M.R. Hand A.R. Flagella M. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. Severe impairment of salivation in Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1)-deficient mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A parallel HCO3−-dependent Cl− uptake mechanism appears to be responsible for much of the remaining Nkcc1-independent fluid secretion (12Nguyen H.V. Stuart-Tilley A. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E.

The current fluid secretion model proposes that this secondary Nkcc1-independent Cl− uptake pathway is a basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger. Consistent with this model, there is an approximately 35% reduction in muscarinic receptor-stimulated saliva secretion in the absence of HCO3− (12Nguyen H.V. Stuart-Tilley A. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. Cl−/HCO3− exchange is acetazolamide sensitive and activated by a muscarinic receptor-induced [Ca2+]i increase in salivary acinar cells.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

The Ae2 (Slc4a2) anion exchanger has been localized to the plasma membrane in mouse parotid and sublingual acinar cells, and it has been suggested that this exchanger is responsible for HCO3−-dependent fluid secretion in salivary glands (12Nguyen H.V. Stuart-Tilley A. Alper S.L. Melvin J.E. Cl−/HCO3− exchange is acetazolamide sensitive and activated by a muscarinic receptor-induced [Ca2+]i increase in salivary acinar cells.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 286: G312-G320Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ae2 is one of 10 members of the Slc4a family (Slc4a1–5 and Slc4a7–11). The designation Slc4a6 was later withdrawn because Slc4a6 and Slc4a7 represent the same gene product. Slc4a1–3 (Ae1–3, respectively) are Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchangers, whereas Slc4a4, -5, -7, -8, and -10 (NBCe1, NBCe2, NBCn1, NDCBE, and NBCn2, respectively) are Na+-coupled HCO3− transporters. The function of Slc4a11 (BTR1) is unknown, but it does not appear to transport HCO3−. The HCO3− transport mechanism for Ae4 (Slc4a9) remains controversial. It has been suggested that Ae4 might mediate Cl−/HCO3− exchange or Na+-HCO3− cotransport (15Pushkin A. Kurtz I.

Ae4 was localized to the basolateral membrane of mouse submandibular gland duct cells, but the expression and function of Ae4 has not been reported in salivary gland acinar cells (18Ko S.B. Luo X.

However, the role of Ae2 has not been directly assessed in salivary glands because systemic Ae2−/− mice die prior to adulthood due to severe acidosis (20Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Prasad V.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30531-30539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that saliva secretion stimulated by a physiological combination of muscarinic and β-adrenergic receptor agonists was reduced by 35% in Ae4−/− mice but was not changed in a conditional knock-out mouse model lacking Ae2 in acinar cells (Ae2−/− mice). These results indicate that Ae4 is a major contributor to fluid secretion by mouse submandibular salivary glands. The secretory dysfunction observed in Ae4−/− mice correlated with decreased Cl−-concentrating capacity of acinar cells during β-adrenergic receptor activation of cAMP signaling. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. C57Bl/6 and BS/129Svj mice were used as controls when appropriate. Gene targeting and genotyping protocols for Ae2fl/fl (C57Bl/6 background), Ae4−/− (BS/129Svj background), and Aqp5-Cre (ACID) mice were as described previously (21Coury F. Zenger S. Stewart A.K.

Littermate Ae2+/flCre+/−, Ae2fl/flCre−/−, and Ae2+/+Cre+/− mice were used as controls. Ae4−/−-Ae2−/− double knock-out mice were generated by crossing Ae4−/− with Ae2fl/fl-ACID-Cre mice, and littermate Ae4+/−-Ae2+/flCre−/− and Ae4+/+-Ae2+/flCre+/− mice were used as controls. Genotyping was performed by PCR from tail biopsies. All animals were housed in microisolator cages with ad libitum access to laboratory chow and water with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Experiments were performed on female and male animals aged between 2 and 4 months. All animal procedures were approved by the NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Animal Care and Use Committee (ASP 13-686). Ex vivo submandibular gland perfusion was performed essentially as reported previously (26Nakamoto T. Brown D.A. Catalán M.A. Gonzalez-Begne M. Romanenko V.G. Melvin J.E. Purinergic P2X7 receptors mediate ATP-induced saliva secretion by the mouse submandibular gland.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4815-4822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gland was transferred to a perfusion chamber, where the common carotid was cannulated (31-gauge) and perfused with a HCO3−-containing, high Cl− solution (B+; see below). Salivation was stimulated by perfusion with the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol (CCh 3The abbreviations used are: CChcarbacholIPRisoproterenolSPQ6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl) quinoliniumBCECF-AM2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl esterEZA6-ethoxyzolamide. ; 0.3 μm) plus the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (IPR; 5 μm).

Submandibular gland acinar cells were isolated by enzyme digestion as reported previously with minor modifications (26Nakamoto T. Brown D.A. Catalán M.A. Gonzalez-Begne M. Romanenko V.G. Melvin J.E.

Briefly, dissected glands were finely minced and digested in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 0.015% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged. The cell pellet was rinsed with Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 0.2% trypsin inhibitor and then digested for 25 min in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml collagenase 2 (Worthington). After centrifugation, the cell pellet was further digested with collagenase for another 25 min and finally resuspended in Eagle's minimum essential medium. Cells were continuously gassed with a mixture of 95% O2, 5% CO2. During the second collagenase incubation, acinar cells were loaded with 5 mm 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl) quinolinium (SPQ) for 25 min or 2 μm 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) for 15 min. Acinar cell clumps were seeded in a perfusion chamber maintained at 37 °C and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TE 300) equipped with a Polychrome IV imaging system coupled to a high speed digital camera (TILL Photonics, Inc). SPQ fluorescence was excited at 340 nm, and emissions were collected at 510 nm. BCECF fluorescence was excited at 440 and 490 nm, and emissions were collected at 530 nm. The resting intracellular pH was determined using the high K+/nigericin protocol as described previously (27Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Intracellular pH measurements in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells utilizing spectroscopic probes generated in situ.Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). The resting intracellular Cl− concentration was measured using the nigericin-tributyltin protocol essentially as described previously (28Nakamoto T. Srivastava A. Romanenko V.G. Ovitt C.E. Perez-Cornejo P. Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. Functional and molecular characterization of the fluid secretion mechanism in human parotid acinar cells.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2007; 292: R2380-R2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to calibration solutions containing 20, 50, and 80 mm Cl−. The calibration solution was as follows: 20 mm KCl, 120 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.005 mm nigericin, and 0.01 mm tributyltin (pH 7.4). The Cl− was changed from 20 to 80 by replacement of potassium gluconate with KCl. 50 μm bumetanide, 50 μm T16Ainh-A01 (Tocris Bioscience), 30 μm ethoxyzolamide (EZA), and 10 μm ethyl-isopropyl amiloride were used in some experiments to inhibit Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporters, Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels, carbonic anhydrases, and Na+/H+ exchangers, respectively. The Cl− uptake experiment included three stages: 1) intracellular Cl− depletion by exposing the cells to a low Cl− (4 mm) bath solution; 2) inhibition of Nkcc1 cotransporter and Tmem16A (transmembrane member 16A) channel by exposure to 50 μm bumetanide and 50 μm T16Ainh-A01, respectively, in the low Cl− bath solution; and 3) Cl− uptake by re-exposure to a high Cl− bath solution in the presence of bumetanide and T16Ainh-A01, inhibitors included to block the two main Cl− movement pathways in acinar cells, Nkcc1 and Tmem16A, respectively (11Evans R.L.

Inhibitors were not included in control experiments. Bath solutions were as follows: HCO3−-containing, high Cl− solution (B+): 4.3 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2; HCO3−-free, high Cl− solution (B−): 4.3 mm KCl, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4; HCO3−-containing, low Cl− solution: 4.3 mm potassium gluconate, 120 mm sodium gluconate, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4; HCO3−-free, low Cl− solution: 4.3 mm potassium gluconate, 145 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4; HCO3−-containing, Na+-free solution: same composition as B+ solution but with replacement of NaCl by N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl and NaHCO3 by choline-HCO3; HCO3−-containing, Na+-free, low Cl− solution: same composition as HCO3−-containing, low Cl− solution but with replacement of NaCl by N-methyl-d-glucamine-glutamate and NaHCO3 by choline-HCO3. HCO3−-containing solutions were gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for at least 30 min. HCO3−-free solutions were gassed with 100% O2. Ex vivo saliva samples obtained in response to CCh+ IPR were collected and stored at −86 °C. The concentration of HCO3− in saliva was determined colorimetrically as described by the manufacturer (Diazyme Laboratories, Poway, CA). The amount of HCO3− secreted in saliva (expressed as microequivalents/10 min) was calculated by dividing the [HCO3−] by the amount of saliva collected during 10 min of stimulation. Results are presented as normalized data for SPQ fluorescence, where the starting fluorescence (F0) is divided by the fluorescence over time (F0/F), except when the intracellular Cl− concentration was determined. Normalized data from BCECF fluorescence (490/440 nm ratio) is obtained by dividing the fluorescence over time by starting fluorescence (F/F0), except when the intracellular pH was determined. Results are given as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test using Origin version 7.0 Software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were performed using separate preparations from at least three different mice for each condition. n refers to the number of experiments performed. Saliva secretion is reduced 60–70% in mice lacking Nkcc1 Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter activity (11Evans R.L. Park K. Turner R.J. Watson G.E. Nguyen H.V. Dennett M.R. Hand A.R. Flagella M. Shull G.E.

To investigate whether Ae4 and/or Ae2 contribute to salivation, ex vivo submandibular gland secretions were collected from conditional Ae2−/− and systemic Ae4−/− mice. The flow rate and total volume of secreted saliva were measured in response to stimulation with 0.3 μm CCh plus 5 μm IPR (30Romanenko V.G. Nakamoto T. Catalán M.A. Gonzalez-Begne M. Schwartz G.J.

The main Cl− efflux pathway in mouse salivary gland acinar cells is the apical Ca2+-activated Tmem16A Cl− channel (29Romanenko V.G. Catalán M.A. Brown D.A. Putzier I. Hartzell H.C. Marmorstein A.D.

Upregulation of Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter activity in rat parotid acinar cells by muscarinic stimulation.J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, stimulation of muscarinic (CCh) and β-adrenergic (IPR) signaling pathways elevates intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP, respectively, and induces maximal and sustained salivation by activation of the main Cl− uptake and exit pathways. Saliva collected from ex vivo submandibular glands suggests that Ae4 expression is important for salivation (Fig. 1A). The amount of saliva secreted by Ae4−/− mice during the initial 2–3 min of stimulation was comparable with that secreted by control littermates. In contrast, there was a sustained decrease in flow rate at later time points (after 3 min), producing less than half the amount of saliva in Ae4−/− mice. The total amount of saliva collected during 10 min of stimulation was 35 ± 4.7% less than secreted by Ae4 WT mice (Fig. 1A, inset). Unexpectedly, the kinetics of salivary flow and the total saliva collected were essentially identical in Ae2−/− and control mice (Fig. 1, B and inset to B). Note that the kinetics of saliva secretion appear to be somewhat different in control (and Ae2−/−) mice from Ae4 wild type mice. In both Ae2−/− and their control mice, the saliva secretion rate during the initial 2–3 min of stimulation gradually decreased to a sustained level. In contrast, the secretion rate is relatively constant during the entire 10-min stimulation period in Ae4 wild type mice (Fig. 1A). Therefore, data analyses were performed comparing knock-out mice with their respective controls. This difference in kinetics is probably due to subtle differences in the secretory machinery between the Ae4 and Ae2 mouse strains (BS/129Svj and C57Bl/6, respectively). Regardless, the total volume of saliva secreted is comparable in Ae4 wild type and Ae2 control mice (Fig. 1, A (inset) and B (inset)), suggesting that the differences in the kinetics of fluid secretion during the first 2–3 min do not significantly influence the sustained secretion or the total amount of saliva secreted. Cl−-dependent fluid secretion requires the intracellular Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) to be greater than its electrochemical equilibrium potential. Consistent with the [Cl−]i being important for regulating Cl−-dependent fluid secretion, acinar cells from Nkcc1−/− mice exhibit a decreased resting [Cl−]i (11Evans R.L. Park K. Turner R.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether Ae4 or Ae2 might also be important for concentrating the [Cl−]i, the Cl−-sensitive fluorescent indicator SPQ was used to directly measure resting [Cl−]i (11Evans R.L. Park K.

https://openalex.org/W2089633879,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results from a combination of progressive insulin resistance and loss of pancreatic beta cell function and/or mass. Insulin signalling occurs through the insulin receptor, (INSR) which is alternatively spliced into two isoforms: INSRA (-exon 11) and INSRB (+exon 11). Because the INSR isoforms have different functional characteristics, their relative expression ratio has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2DM. We studied levels of INSR isoform mRNA in liver samples taken from 46 individuals with or without T2DM at Roux-en-Y (RYGB) surgery, and on average 17 (± 5.6) months later in 16 of the same individuals (8 diabetic and non-diabetic patients). INSRA or INSRB was also overexpressed in HepG2 cells to ascertain their effect on AKT phosphorylation and PCK1 expression as markers of insulin-mediated metabolic signalling. We found the INSRB:A isoform ratio was reduced in individuals with T2DM in comparison to those with normal glucose tolerance and normalised with remission of diabetes. The INSRB:A ratio increased due to a reduction in the alternatively spliced INSRA isoform following remission of diabetes. Overexpressing INSRA isoform in HepG2 hepatoma cells reduced inhibition of PCK1 transcription and did not increase AKT phosphorylation in response to insulin load compared to the effect of overexpressing the B isoform. Data presented here revitalizes the role of the INSR isoforms in the pathogenesis of T2DM, and suggests that an abrogated INSRB:A ratio that favours the INSRA isoform may negatively impact insulin-mediated metabolic signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1984530192,"The capacity of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes (pRBC) to adhere to the endothelial lining in the microvasculature and to red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the virulence of the parasite, the pathogenesis and development of severe malaria. Rosetting, the binding of uninfected RBC to pRBC, is frequently observed in individuals with severe malaria and is mediated by the N-terminal NTS-DBL1α domain of the adhesin Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) expressed at the surface of the pRBC. Heparan sulfate has been suggested to be an important receptor for the NTS-DBL1α variant IT4var60 expressed by the parasite FCR3S1.2. Here, we have determined the binding site of NTS-DBL1α (IT4var60) to the RBC and heparin using a set of recombinant, mutated proteins expressed in and purified from E. coli. All the variants were studied for their ability to bind to RBC, their capacities to disrupt FCR3S1.2 rosettes, their affinities for heparin and their binding to rosette-disruptive mAbs. Our results suggest that NTS-DBL1α mediates binding to RBC through a limited number of basic amino acid residues localized on the surface of subdomains 1 (SD1) and 2 (SD2). The SD2-binding site is localized in close proximity to one of two previously identified binding sites in the rosetting PfEMP1 of the parasite PaloAlto-varO. The binding site in SD2 of NTS-DBL1α could represent a template for the development of anti-rosetting drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2005319846,"Background Although APP and its proteolytic metabolites have been well examined in the central nervous system, there remains limited information of their functions outside of the brain. For example, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (Aβ) immunoreactivity have both been demonstrated in intestinal epithelial cells. Based upon the critical role of these cells in absorption and secretion, we sought to determine whether APP or its metabolite amyloid β (Aβ), had a definable function in these cells. Methodology/Principal Findings The human colonic epithelial cell line, Caco-2 cells, were cultured to examine APP expression and Aβ secretion, uptake, and stimulation. Similar to human colonic epithelium stains, Caco-2 cells expressed APP. They also secreted Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42, with LPS stimulating higher concentrations of Aβ 1-40 secretion. The cells also responded to Aβ 1-40 stimulation by increasing IL-6 cytokine secretion and decreasing cholesterol uptake. Conversely, stimulation with a sAPP-derived peptide increased cholesterol uptake. APP was associated with CD36 but not FATP4 in co-IP pull down experiments from the Caco-2 cells. Moreover, stimulation of APP with an agonist antibody acutely decreased CD36-mediated cholesterol uptake. Conclusions/Significance APP exists as part of a multi-protein complex with CD36 in human colonic epithelial cells where its proteolytic fragments have complex, reciprocal roles in regulating cholesterol uptake. A biologically active peptide fragment from the N-terminal derived, sAPP, potentiated cholesterol uptake while the β secretase generated product, Aβ1-40, attenuated it. These data suggest that APP is important in regulating intestinal cholesterol uptake in a fashion dependent upon specific proteolytic pathways. Moreover, this biology may be applicable to cells beyond the gastrointestinal tract."

Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that cultured rat mesentery tissues contain viable microvascular networks and could be used to probe pericyte-endothelial cell interactions. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of the rat mesentery culture model for anti-angiogenic drug testing by time-lapse quantification of network growth. Mesenteric windows were harvested from adult rats, secured in place with an insert, and cultured for 3 days according to 3 experimental groups: 1) 10% serum (angiogenesis control), 2) 10% serum + sunitinib (SU11248), and 3) 10% serum + bevacizumab. Labeling with FITC conjugated BSI-lectin on Day 0 and 3 identified endothelial cells along blood and lymphatic microvascular networks. Comparison between day 0 (before) and 3 (after) in networks stimulated by 10% serum demonstrated a dramatic increase in vascular density and capillary sprouting. Growing networks contained proliferating endothelial cells and NG2+ vascular pericytes. Media supplementation with sunitinib (SU11248) or bevacizumab both inhibited the network angiogenic responses. The comparison of the same networks before and after treatment enabled the identification of tissue specific responses. Our results establish, for the first time, the ability to evaluate an anti-angiogenic drug based on time-lapse imaging on an intact microvascular network in an ex vivo scenario."
https://openalex.org/W1998770139,"Abstract The RAG endonuclease consists of RAG1, which contains the active site for DNA cleavage, and RAG2, an accessory factor whose interaction with RAG1 is critical for catalytic function. How RAG2 activates RAG1 is not understood. Here, we used biolayer interferometry and pulldown assays to identify regions of RAG1 necessary for interaction with RAG2 and to measure the RAG1-RAG2 binding affinity (KD ∼0.4 μm) (where RAG1 and RAG2 are recombination activating genes 1 or 2). Using the Hermes transposase as a guide, we constructed a 36-kDa “mini” RAG1 capable of interacting robustly with RAG2. Mini-RAG1 consists primarily of the catalytic center and the residues N-terminal to it, but it lacks a zinc finger region in RAG1 previously implicated in binding RAG2. The ability of Mini-RAG1 to interact with RAG2 depends on a predicted α-helix (amino acids 997–1008) near the RAG1 C terminus and a region of RAG1 from amino acids 479 to 559. Two adjacent acidic amino acids in this region (Asp-546 and Glu-547) are important for both the RAG1-RAG2 interaction and recombination activity, with Asp-546 of particular importance. Structural modeling of Mini-RAG1 suggests that Asp-546/Glu-547 lie near the predicted 997-1008 α-helix and components of the active site, raising the possibility that RAG2 binding alters the structure of the RAG1 active site. Quantitative Western blotting allowed us to estimate that mouse thymocytes contain on average ∼1,800 monomers of RAG1 and ∼15,000 molecules of RAG2, implying that nuclear concentrations of RAG1 and RAG2 are below the KD value for their interaction, which could help limit off-target RAG activity."

Moreover, we identified mutants that caused an alteration in the kinetics of this transcriptional control. Loss of function of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (vma1) or a defect in the biosynthesis of the osmolyte glycerol (gpd1) caused a prolonged repression of housekeeping genes and a delay in gene activation at inducible loci. Both mutants have a defect in the relocation of RNA polymerase II complexes at stress defense genes. Accordingly salt-activated transcription is delayed and less efficient upon partially respiratory growth conditions in which glycerol production is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the loss of Hog1 MAP kinase function aggravates the loss of RNA polymerase II from housekeeping loci, which apparently do not accumulate at inducible genes. Additionally the Def1 RNA polymerase II degradation factor, but not a high pool of nuclear polymerase II complexes, is needed for efficient stress-induced gene activation.

https://openalex.org/W2080964792,"Captive rearing programs (hatcheries) are often used in conservation and management efforts for at-risk salmonid fish populations. However, hatcheries typically rear juveniles in environments that contrast starkly with natural conditions, which may lead to phenotypic and/or genetic changes that adversely affect the performance of juveniles upon their release to the wild. Environmental enrichment has been proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficacy of population restoration efforts from captive-rearing programs; in this study, we examine the influence of environmental enrichment during embryo and yolk-sac larval rearing on the transcriptome of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Full siblings were reared in either a hatchery environment devoid of structure or an environment enriched with gravel substrate. At the end of endogenous feeding by juveniles, we examined patterns of gene transcript abundance in head tissues using the cGRASP-designed Agilent 4×44K microarray. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) indicated that 808 genes were differentially transcribed between the rearing environments and a total of 184 gene ontological (GO) terms were over- or under-represented in this gene list, several associated with mitosis/cell cycle and muscle and heart development. There were also pronounced differences among families in the degree of transcriptional response to rearing environment enrichment, suggesting that gene-by-environment effects, possibly related to parental origin, could influence the efficacy of enrichment interventions."

https://openalex.org/W2081208442,Cystic fibrosis patients are highly susceptible to infections with non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Especially Mycobacterium abscessus infections are common but reliable diagnosis is hampered by non-specific clinical symptoms and insensitive mycobacterial culture. In the present study we established novel methods for rapid detection and immune characterization of Mycobacterium abscessus infection in cystic fibrosis patients. We performed Mycobacterium abscessus specific DNA-strip- and quantitative PCR-based analyses of non-cultured sputum samples to detect and characterize Mycobacterium abscessus infections. Concomitantly in vitro T-cell reactivation with purified protein derivatives (PPDs) from different mycobacterial species was used to determine Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cell cytokine expression of infected cystic fibrosis patients. Four of 35 cystic fibrosis patients (11.4%) were Mycobacterium abscessus culture positive and showed concordant DNA-strip-test results. Quantitative PCR revealed marked differences of mycobacterial burden between cystic fibrosis patients and during disease course. Tandem-repeat analysis classified distinct Mycobacterium abscessus strains of infected cystic fibrosis patients and excluded patient-to-patient transmission. Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cells were detected in the blood of cystic fibrosis patients with confirmed chronic infection and a subgroup of patients without evidence of Mycobacterium abscessus infection. Comparison of cytokine expression and phenotypic markers revealed increased proportions of CD40L positive T-cells that lack Interleukin-2 expression as a marker for chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Direct sputum examination enabled rapid diagnosis and quantification of Mycobacterium abscessus in cystic fibrosis patients. T-cell in vitro reactivation and cytokine expression analyses may contribute to diagnosis of chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infection.
https://openalex.org/W2090817570,"Vibrio mimicus (V.mimicus) is a causative agent of ascites disease in aquatic animals. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the outer membrane protein U (OmpU) from V.mimicus is an immunoprotective antigen with six immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes. Although the N-terminus of OmpU contains potential binding motifs, it remained unclear whether OmpU possesses adhesion function. Here, the adhesive capacity of recombinant OmpU and V.mimicus to epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells was determined by immunofluorescence and adherence assay. The results showed that after co-incubated with rOmpU, an obvious visible green fluorescence could be observed on the EPC cell surface and the nuclei exhibited blue fluorescence; while the control cell surface did not show any signal, only nuclei exhibited blue fluorescence. The average number of wild-type strain adhered to each cell was 32.3 ± 4.5. The average adhesion number of OmpU gene deletion mutant was significantly reduced to 10.8 ± 0.5 (P < 0.01) and restored to 31.3 ± 2.8 by complement strain (P >0.05). Pretreatment of cells with rOmpU reduced the average adhesion number of wild-type strain to 9.7 ± 2.9 (P < 0.01). Likewise, binding was significantly decreased to 8.8 ± 3.2 (P < 0.01) due to blocking role of OmpU antibodies. To determine binding motifs of OmpU, six immunodominant B-cell epitope peptides labeled with FITC were employed in flow cytometry-based binding assay. Two FITC-labeled epitope peptides (aa90-101 and aa173-192) showed strong binding to EPC cells (the fluorescence positive cell rate was 99 ± 0.6% and 98 ± 0.3%, respectively), which could be specifically competed by excess corresponding unlabeled peptides, whereas the remaining four showed a low level of background binding. This is the first demonstration that OmpU possesses adhesion function and its N terminal 90–101 and 173–192 amino acid regions are critical sites for cell surface binding."

Stable isotope ratios in plants are known to reflect geographical variations. In this study we analysed four stable isotope ratios in order to develop a model able to identify the geographic origin of Norway spruce in the European Alps.δ18O, δ2H, δ13C and δ15N were measured in bulk needles of Picea abies sampled in 20 sites in and around the European Alps. Environmental and spatial variables were found to be related to the measured isotope ratios. An ordinary least squares regression was used to identify the most important factor in stable isotope variability in bulk needles. Spatial autocorrelation was tested for all isotope ratios by means of Moran's I. δ18O, δ2H and δ15N values differed significantly between sites. Distance from the coast had the greatest influence on δ2H, while latitude and longitude were strongly related to δ18O. δ13C values did not appear to have any relationship with geographical position, while δ15N values were influenced by distance from the motorway. The regression model improved the explanatory power of the spatial and environmental variables. Positive spatial autocorrelations were found for δ18O and δ2H values.The δ 18O, δ2H and δ15N values in P. abies bulk needles are a suitable proxy to identify geographic origin as they vary according to geographical position. Although the regression model showed the explanatory variables to have significant power and stability, we conclude that our model might be improved by multivariate spatial interpolation of the δ 18O and δ2H values."

https://openalex.org/W2004964062,"Significant disparities in the incidence of polio existed during its eradication campaign in India. In 2006, Muslims, who comprise 16% of the population in affected states, comprised 70% of paralytic polio cases. This disparity was initially blamed on the Muslims and a rumor that the vaccination program was a plot to sterilize their children. Using the framework of structural violence, this paper describes how the socio-political and historical context of Muslim populations in India shaped the polio disparity.A qualitative study utilizing methods of rapid ethnography was conducted from May-August 2009 in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India. Field methods included participant observation of vaccination teams, historical document research, and 107 interviews with both Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) stakeholders and families with vaccine-eligible children. Almost all respondents agreed that Aligarh was a highly segregated city, mostly due to riots after Partition and during the 1990s. Since the formation of segregated neighborhoods, most respondents described that ""Muslim areas"" had been underdeveloped compared to ""Hindu areas,"" facilitating the physical transmission of poliovirus. Distrust of the government and resistance to vaccination were linked to this disparate development and fears of sterilization influenced by the ""Family Planning Program"" from 1976-1977.Ethnic violence and social marginalization since the Partition and during the rise of Hindu nationalism led to distrust of the government, the formation of segregated slums, and has made Muslims victims of structural violence. This led to the creation of disease-spreading physical environments, lowered vaccine efficacy, and disproportionately higher levels of resistance to vaccination. The causes of the polio disparity found in this study elucidate the nature of possible other health disparities affecting minorities in India.This study is limited by the manual coding of the transcribed data, size, and some dialectal difficulties in translation."

This approach revealed a novel mode for single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB)-DNA binding, in which SSB interacts with both the leading and lagging single-strand segments and the parental duplex of the fork. Cross-linking to a novel region within SSB is observed only when it is bound to forked structures. This binding mode is also followed by PriB. PriA binds to the fork, excluding SSB and PriB, interacting with the primer terminus, single-stranded leading and lagging strands and duplex in immediate proximity of the fork.

https://openalex.org/W2005999190,"Introduction China is considered a country of low HIV prevalence (780,000 people living with HIV), however, HIV infections among high-risk populations continue to grow at alarming rates. Voluntary Counseling and Testing services were first implemented in 2003, and oral rapid HIV testing (ORHT) began in 2012. Dentists, as oral health experts, would be well placed to conduct ORHT. We assessed willingness of dentists to undertake ORHT in their clinical practice. Methods A cross-sectional, paper-based survey of dentists from the Xi’an region of China was conducted from April to June 2013. Dentists were recruited from Shaanxi Stomatological Association using a stratified sampling methodology. A 40-item survey was used to measure knowledge of HIV, attitudes toward people living with HIV and willingness to conduct ORHT. Results 477 dentists completed the survey with a mean HIV knowledge test score of 13.2/18 (SD 1.9). If made available in the dental setting, 276 (57.9%) preferred to use blood to diagnose HIV, only 190 (39.8%) preferred saliva or both. Four hundred and thirty-five (91.2%) thought that ORHT was needed in dental clinics. Female dentists felt more accepting of ORHT than males (93.8% vs. 87.8%; χ2=5.145; p<0.05). 42.6% of the participants who responded thought that lack of education on ORHT for dentists was the most urgent problem to solve for ORHT, 144 (31.3%) thought that lack of support for ORHT from patients was the most urgent problem. There was statistically significant difference among dental hospital, dentistry and department of dentistry (χ2=24.176; p<0.05). Conclusions The majority of Chinese dentists thought that ORHT was needed in the dental setting. Providing opportunities for dentists and dental students to learn about HIV testing guidelines and practices is needed as well as feasibility and implementation science research."
https://openalex.org/W2046249436,"Cigarette smoke is a risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). It contains several carcinogens known to initiate and promote tumorigenesis as well as metastasis. The nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is one of the strongest carcinogens in tobacco and our previous studies have shown its proliferation-promoting role in the progression of ESCC. Recently, NNK was identified as an agonist for both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Thus, we hypothesized that the cancer-promoting effect of NNK was likely mediated through beta-adrenoceptors in ESCC. Therefore, we investigated the comprehensive role of NNK in ESCC in vitro and in vivo, and found that NNK promoted many oncogenic features including ESCC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth as well as ESCC cell migration and invasion. Western blotting showed that NNK induced significant up-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor as well as down-regulation of Bax. Importantly, the oncogenic effects of NNK in ESCC and the altered protein expression were reversed to some extent by down-regulation of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors with the beta2-adrenoceptor showing a greater rescue effect. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that NNK plays an oncogenic role in ESCC through beta-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, beta2-adrenoceptor might play a more important role in this process. Our findings might provide a chemoprevention and therapy strategy for cigarette smoke-related ESCC carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2136629193,"African trypanosomes cause a parasitic disease known as sleeping sickness. Mitochondrial transcript maturation in these organisms requires a RNA editing reaction that is characterized by the insertion and deletion of U-nucleotides into otherwise non-functional mRNAs. Editing represents an ideal target for a parasite-specific therapeutic intervention since the reaction cycle is absent in the infected host. In addition, editing relies on a macromolecular protein complex, the editosome, that only exists in the parasite. Therefore, all attempts to search for editing interfering compounds have been focused on molecules that bind to proteins of the editing machinery. However, in analogy to other RNA-driven biochemical pathways it should be possible to stall the reaction by targeting its substrate RNAs. Here we demonstrate inhibition of editing by specific aminoglycosides. The molecules bind into the major groove of the gRNA/pre-mRNA editing substrates thereby causing a stabilization of the RNA molecules through charge compensation and an increase in stacking. The data shed light on mechanistic details of the editing process and identify critical parameters for the development of new trypanocidal compounds."

We identified a novel biomarker, Bora (previously called C13orf34), that is associated with radiosensitivity. In the current study, we set out to investigate how Bora might be involved in response to irradiation. We found a novel function of Bora in DNA damage repair response. Bora down-regulation increased colony formation in cells exposed to irradiation. This increased resistance to irradiation in Bora-deficient cells is likely due to a faster rate of double-strand breaks repair. After irradiation, Bora-knockdown cells displayed increased G2-M cell cycle arrest and increased Chk2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Bora specifically interacted with the tandem breast cancer gene 1 C-terminal domain of MDC1 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, and overexpression of Bora could abolish irradiation induced MDC1 foci formation. In summary, Bora may play a significant role in radiosensitivity through the regulation of MDC1 and DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2072356836,"Signaling by the Gβγ subunit of Gi protein, leading to downstream c-Src-induced activation of the Ras/c-Raf1/MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and its upregulation of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) activity, was recently shown to mediate the heightened contractility in proasthmatic sensitized isolated airway smooth muscle (ASM), as well as allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in an in vivo animal model of allergic asthma. This study investigated whether cultured human ASM (HASM) cells derived from asthmatic donor lungs exhibit constitutively increased PDE activity that is attributed to intrinsically upregulated Gβγ signaling coupled to c-Src activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK1/2 cascade. We show that, relative to normal cells, asthmatic HASM cells constitutively exhibit markedly increased intrinsic PDE4 activity coupled to heightened Gβγ-regulated phosphorylation of c-Src and ERK1/2, and direct co-localization of the latter with the PDE4D isoform. These signaling events and their induction of heightened PDE activity are acutely suppressed by treating asthmatic HASM cells with a Gβγ inhibitor. Importantly, along with increased Gβγ activation, asthmatic HASM cells also exhibit constitutively increased direct binding of the small Rap1 GTPase-activating protein, Rap1GAP, to the α-subunit of Gi protein, which serves to cooperatively facilitate Ras activation and, thereby, enable enhanced Gβγ-regulated ERK1/2-stimulated PDE activity. Collectively, these data are the first to identify that intrinsically increased signaling via the Gβγ subunit, facilitated by Rap1GAP recruitment to the α-subunit, mediates the constitutively increased PDE4 activity detected in asthmatic HASM cells. These new findings support the notion that interventions targeted at suppressing Gβγ signaling may lead to novel approaches to treat asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2084606915,"NF-κB essential modulator, NEMO, plays a key role in canonical NF-κB signaling induced by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines and genotoxic agents. To dissect the different biochemical and functional roles of NEMO in NF-κB signaling, various mutant forms of NEMO have been previously analyzed. However, transient or stable overexpression of wild-type NEMO can significantly inhibit NF-κB activation, thereby confounding the analysis of NEMO mutant phenotypes. What levels of NEMO overexpression lead to such an artifact and what levels are tolerated with no significant impact on NEMO function in NF-κB activation are currently unknown. Here we purified full-length recombinant human NEMO protein and used it as a standard to quantify the average number of NEMO molecules per cell in a 1.3E2 NEMO-deficient murine pre-B cell clone stably reconstituted with full-length human NEMO (C5). We determined that the C5 cell clone has an average of 4 x 105 molecules of NEMO per cell. Stable reconstitution of 1.3E2 cells with different numbers of NEMO molecules per cell has demonstrated that a 10-fold range of NEMO expression (0.6–6x105 molecules per cell) yields statistically equivalent NF-κB activation in response to the DNA damaging agent etoposide. Using the C5 cell line, we also quantified the number of NEMO molecules per cell in several commonly employed human cell lines. These results establish baseline numbers of endogenous NEMO per cell and highlight surprisingly normal functionality of NEMO in the DNA damage pathway over a wide range of expression levels that can provide a guideline for future NEMO reconstitution studies."
https://openalex.org/W2085053103,"The intermediate filament protein IFA-2 is essential for the structural integrity of the Caenorhabditis elegans epidermis. It is one of the major components of the fibrous organelle, an epidermal structure comprised of apical and basal hemidesmosomes linked by cytoplasmic intermediate filaments that serve to transmit force from the muscle to the cuticle. Mutations of IFA-2 result in epidermal fragility and separation of the apical and basal epidermal surfaces during postembryonic growth. An IFA-2 lacking the head domain fully rescues the IFA-2 null mutant, whereas an IFA-2 lacking the tail domain cannot. Conversely, an isolated IFA-2 head was able to localize to fibrous organelles whereas the tail was not. Taken together these results suggest that the head domain contains redundant signals for IF localization, whereas non-redundant essential functions map to the IFA-2, tail, although the tail is unlikely to be directly involved in fibrous organelle localization."
