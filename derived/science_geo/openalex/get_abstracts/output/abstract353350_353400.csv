https://openalex.org/W2073759231,"Cancer cells possess traits reminiscent of those ascribed to normal stem cells. It is unclear, however, whether these phenotypic similarities reflect the activity of common molecular pathways. Here, we analyze the enrichment patterns of gene sets associated with embryonic stem (ES) cell identity in the expression profiles of various human tumor types. We find that histologically poorly differentiated tumors show preferential overexpression of genes normally enriched in ES cells, combined with preferential repression of Polycomb-regulated genes. Moreover, activation targets of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc are more frequently overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. In breast cancers, this ES-like signature is associated with high-grade estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, often of the basal-like subtype, and with poor clinical outcome. The ES signature is also present in poorly differentiated glioblastomas and bladder carcinomas. We identify a subset of ES cell-associated transcription regulators that are highly expressed in poorly differentiated tumors. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between genes associated with ES cell identity and the histopathological traits of tumors and support the possibility that these genes contribute to stem cell-like phenotypes shown by many tumors."

Moreover, although human social decision making has been explored in a social psychology context, few neural explanations for the observed findings have been considered. To bridge this gap and improve models of human social decision making, we investigated whether acquiring a good reputation, which is an important incentive in human social behaviors, activates the same reward circuitry as monetary rewards. In total, 19 subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments involving monetary and social rewards. The acquisition of one's good reputation robustly activated reward-related brain areas, notably the striatum, and these overlapped with the areas activated by monetary rewards. Our findings support the idea of a “common neural currency” for rewards and represent an important first step toward a neural explanation for complex human social behaviors.

Our findings support the idea of a “common neural currency” for rewards and represent an important first step toward a neural explanation for complex human social behaviors. The decision-making process has recently attracted the attention of researchers from various disciplines, and considerable progress has been made in understanding its neural basis (Daw and Doya, 2006Daw N.D. Doya K. The computational neurobiology of learning and reward.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, Montague et al., 2006Montague P.R. King-Casas B.

However, the neural basis of human decision making in social situations is relatively less well understood because of its complexity. During the mid-twentieth century, in an effort to explain human social decision-making behaviors, psychologists incorporated the “rational agent” model, which is a basic economic theory, into the model of human social decision making. The social exchange theory (Homans, 1958Homans G.C. Social behavior as exchange.Am. J. Sociol. 1958; 63: 597-606Crossref Google Scholar, Lawler and Thye, 1999Lawler E.J. Thye S.R.

The Social Psychology of Groups. Wiley, New York1959Google Scholar) argues that social behaviors largely stem from the desire to maximize the ratio of social rewards to social costs, as is the case for monetary rewards and costs in economic settings. According to this theory, an individual engages in a certain social behavior (e.g., helping others) only when the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. Importantly, the benefits in such a case take the form not only of material rewards, such as food and money, but also of more abstract rewards, such as social approval from others. This theory provides a base from which to explore complex human social decision making and behaviors in the simple terms of “reward.” In the present study, from among the many possible rewards in human social interactions, we focused on an individual's reputation or the impression of an individual formed by others. The importance of processing one's own reputation in human social decision making has been highlighted by the theoretical research on the evolution of human cooperation (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003Fehr E. Fischbacher U. The nature of human altruism.Nature. 2003; 425: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cooperation in iterated games is significantly affected by the concern for reputation (Kreps and Wilson, 1982Kreps D.M. Wilson R. Reputation and imperfect information.J. Econ. Theory. 1982; 27: 253-279Crossref Scopus (1433) Google Scholar), and that an individual's motivation to acquire a good reputation or “image score” (Milinski et al., 2001Milinski M. Semmann D. Bakker T.C. Krambeck H.J. Cooperation through indirect reciprocity: image scoring or standing strategy?.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2001; 268: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Wedekind and Milinski, 2000Wedekind C. Milinski M. Cooperation through image scoring in humans.Science. 2000; 288: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) might drive cooperation through indirect reciprocity. Social psychological studies have also shown that social approval has a profound impact on everyday decision making (Benabou and Tirole, 2006Benabou R. Tirole J. Incentives and prosocial behavior.Am. Econ. Rev. 2006; 96: 1652-1678Crossref Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). The recognition that one has a good reputation can induce a feeling of happiness (i.e., a hedonic component of reward or “liking”), and individuals are often motivated to seek such social approval (i.e., a motivational component of reward or “wanting”) according to behavioral evidence. For example, human subjects were motivated to present themselves in a positive manner or to engage in prosocial behaviors when their perception of being watched by others was enhanced (Bateson et al., 2006Bateson M. Nettle D. Roberts G. Cues of being watched enhance cooperation in a real-world setting.Biol. Lett. 2006; 2: 412-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, Haley and Fessler, 2005Haley K.J.

Thus, although social exchange theory assumes that gaining a good reputation is a reward and ample behavioral evidence supports its significant role in human decision making in a social context, the way in which its reward value is represented in the human brain remains unclear. Furthermore, while previous neuroimaging studies have shown that activities in the reward-related area, the striatum, are modulated by the perception of the moral character (or reputation) of others (Delgado et al., 2005Delgado M.R.

Tomlin D. Anen C. Camerer C.F. Quartz S.R. Montague P.R. Getting to know you: reputation and trust in a two-person economic exchange.Science. 2005; 308: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, there has been no study investigating how the brain processes one's own positive reputation. Understanding this process is an essential step in constructing a neural model of human social decision making based on social reward. The goals of the present study were to investigate whether the acquisition of a good reputation activated reward-related brain areas, specifically the striatum, and, if so, whether this social reward activated the same reward circuitry as monetary rewards, as predicted by social exchange theory. The striatum is known to be involved in reward processing. Striatal neurons were reported to show activity in response to liquid and food rewards in nonhuman primates and were activated by both the anticipation and delivery of the reward (Schultz, 2000Schultz W. Multiple reward signals in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, Schultz et al., 2000Schultz W. Tremblay L. Hollerman J.R. Reward processing in primate orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), similar findings have been reported in humans: the striatum showed increased activation in response not only to primary rewards such as liquid or food (Berns et al., 2001Berns G.S.

We therefore predicted that when individuals perceived themselves to have a good reputation among others, the striatum would be activated, and the activated areas would overlap with those activated by monetary rewards. Nineteen subjects participated in two fMRI experiments (i.e., monetary and social reward experiments) on two separate days. In the monetary reward experiment, the subjects performed a simple gambling task (Figure 1A). In each trial, they were asked to choose one of three cards and were given 0, 30, or 60 yen depending upon the card chosen. Unknown to the subjects, the amount that they could earn in each block of eight trials was predetermined; thus, the monetary reward each subject received during each block was systematically manipulated (Figure 1B). After the subjects completed the monetary reward experiment, they were asked to respond to several personality questionnaires and to introduce themselves in front of a video camera. They were told that others would evaluate them based on their responses to these questionnaires and the video-taped self-introduction and that they would be shown the results in the next fMRI experiment. In the social reward experiment, the same 19 subjects were presented with a picture of themselves and a word or phrase indicating the impression of them formed by others (Figure 2A). However, in reality, the items that they were presented with were predetermined, such that all subjects had the same social reward experience. By systematically grouping six items (into one block) based on desirability ratings provided by another group of participants (n = 33), the level of social reward experienced by subjects in each block was also manipulated. The impressions of other people were also presented (Figure 2B), to exclude the possibility that seeing a positive word per se might be rewarding, as was suggested by a previous study (Hamann and Mao, 2002Hamann S. Mao H. Positive and negative emotional verbal stimuli elicit activity in the left amygdala.Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).Figure 2Experimental Paradigm for the Social Reward ExperimentShow full caption(A) The sequence of events during an HSR-Self trial.

The item was removed for 1 s until the next item was displayed. Six items were presented in each block (24 s).(B) Study design of the social reward experiment.

Subjects viewed each item not only as impressions of themselves but also as impressions of other people.

Subjects viewed each item not only as impressions of themselves but also as impressions of other people. Regardless of the impression targets, the subjects were asked to rate the desirability of each item during scanning. In NoSR blocks, “XXX” was presented instead of an item, and the subjects were asked to press a button each time they saw it. There were few trials in which the subjects did not press a button to choose a card (an average of 0.7% per subject), and there were no significant differences in the number of failed trials among the three conditions. The result of a 1 × 3 (high monetary reward [HMR], low monetary reward [LMR], or no monetary reward [NoMR]) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference in reaction time among the conditions. Multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction showed that the mean reaction time for the HMR condition (490 ms) was slower than that for the NoMR condition (448 ms; p < 0.05), whereas the mean reaction time for the LMR condition (451 ms) did not differ significantly from the other two conditions. There were few trials in which the subjects did not press a button (an average of 1% per subject). The result of a 2 (impression target: Self or Other) × 3 (reward level: high social reward [HSR], low social reward [LSR], or no social reward [NoSR]) repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant differences in the number of failed trials among the conditions. An analysis of the item desirability judgment on a three-point scale in the fMRI scanner revealed that, as predicted, regardless of whether the items were presented as impressions of oneself or others, those in the HSR conditions were rated as significantly more desirable than those in the LSR conditions (HSR versus LSR in Self and Other conditions, both p values <0.001, paired t tests; Figure 3A). When these ratings were submitted to a 2 (impression target: Self or Other) × 2 (reward level: HSR or LSR) repeated-measures ANOVA, the main effects of both the impression target and the reward level were significant (both p values <0.001), and their interaction was also significant (p < 0.01). Two paired t tests (Self versus Other in each of the HSR and LSR conditions) showed that, although subjects were presented with the same items between the Self and Other conditions, they tended to rate them as significantly less desirable when they were presented as impressions of themselves; this tendency was somewhat stronger for the LSR condition (p < 0.01) than the HSR condition (p < 0.05). Notably, however, the mean ratings of the HSR items in the Self and Other conditions were close to the maximum value (i.e., three), indicating a ceiling effect, and when a paired-sample Wilcoxon test was used, the difference between the HSR-Self and HSR-Other conditions was not significant (p = 0.067). The desirability ratings of the same items after fMRI scanning with a seven-point scale also showed that subjects rated items in the HSR condition as significantly more desirable than those in the LSR condition (paired t test, p < 0.001; Figure 3B). (A) Item desirability ratings for HSR and LSR blocks in both the Self and Other conditions during fMRI scanning. The subjects used a three-point scale (1 = undesirable, 2 = neutral, and 3 = desirable). (B) Desirability ratings for the same items after scanning. The subjects used a seven-point scale (1 = highly undesirable, 4 = neutral, and 7 = highly desirable). (C) Subjective judgment of how happy the subjects felt upon seeing each item as an impressions of themselves formed by others, using a seven-point scale (1 = very unhappy, 4 = neutral, and 7 = very happy). (D) Mean reaction times for all conditions in the social reward experiment. Subjects judged the desirability of each item presented in the HSR and LSR conditions and pressed a button each time “XXX” was presented in the NoSR condition. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM). ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗p < 0.05 (paired t test, two-tailed). An analysis of happiness ratings revealed that subjects felt significantly happier when seeing impressions of themselves in the HSR condition than in the LSR condition (paired t test, p < 0.001; Figure 3C). Thus, as we predicted, the subjects rated items in the HSR condition as more desirable both during and after scanning and felt much happier in the HSR-Self condition than the LSR-Self condition, indicating that our manipulation of the social reward level was successful. The results of a 2 (impression target; Self or Other) × 3 (reward level; HSR, LSR, or NoSR) repeated-measures ANOVA of reaction time revealed significant main effects of both impression target (p < 0.01) and reward level (p < 0.001) as well as their interaction (p < 0.05; Figure 3D). The mean reaction time in the NoSR condition (681 ms) was the fastest, and the subjects were slowest to respond in the LSR condition (1337 ms), probably because of ambiguity regarding the desirability of the items used in this condition. The reaction time for the HSR condition fell between the two, with a mean of 1124 ms, and the differences among the three conditions were all significant (multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction, all p values <0.001). When conditions with the same reward level were directly compared between Self versus Other using a paired t test, the mean reaction times for the Self condition were slower than for the Other condition when the social reward level was high (p < 0.01) or low (p < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the Self versus Other conditions in the NoSR condition (p = 0.48). To broadly depict the brain areas related to monetary reward, we contrasted the HMR condition with the NoMR condition. This revealed significant activations in several brain areas, notably the striatum, insula, midbrain, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (see Figure S1 available online), which was in agreement with previous findings on monetary reward processing (Breiter et al., 2001Breiter H.C.

The areas activated in this contrast are shown in Table S1. The subsequent analyses of the social reward experiment used the contrast of HMR versus NoMR as a mask to explore the overlap between monetary and social rewards. To specify the brain areas involved in the processing of social reward, we used the interaction contrast of (Self − Other) (HSR − NoSR). This was intended to identify the areas where activity was specifically enhanced when a high social reward was directed toward the self. This contrast was explored within the above-mentioned monetary reward-related areas. As predicted, we found significant activations in the striatum (Figure 4 and Table 1), indicating that social reward shares the same neural basis as monetary reward (all of the areas activated in this interaction contrast without the mask of the monetary reward experiment are listed in Table S2). Besides the striatum, only the thalamus and cerebellum showed common activations for both types of rewards. Within the striatum, the commonly activated areas included the bilateral caudate nucleus and bilateral putamen (Figure 5A). In addition, the activated areas in the main effects of self face (the Self − Other contrast) and other face (the Other − Self contrast) are listed in Table S3.Table 1Areas Commonly Activated by Both Types of RewardLocationSideMNI CoordinateZVoxelCluster pxyz(Self − Other) (HSR − NoSR)Striatum/thalamus866<0.001 PutamenR2216−44.08 Caudate nucleusR121242.95 ThalamusL−18−6123.61 ThalamusR4−1403.89Striatum3610.031 PutamenL−2220−23.60 Caudate nucleusL−81423.52CerebellumR10−52−343.294510.012 CerebellumL−4−64−123.90The interaction contrast of (Self − Other) (HSR − NoSR) was explored within the monetary reward-related areas (HMR − NoMR).

Error bars indicate the SEM. The percent signal changes were extracted from the peak voxels in these four regions of the striatum for all conditions of the social reward and monetary reward experiments. Initially, using only the data from the social reward experiment, four separate 2 (impression target: Self or Other) × 3 (reward level: HSR, LSR, or NoSR) repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted. As predicted, we found significant interactions in all four regions (all p values <0.05), indicating that the positivity of the items alone (i.e., seeing positive words per se) could not explain these results. Furthermore, within each region, the three social reward levels for the Self conditions were compared with the three Monetary Reward levels by 2 (reward types: Monetary or Social) × 3 (reward level: high reward, low reward, or no reward) repeated-measures ANOVAs. Although the interactions were significant in the caudate nucleus and putamen in the right hemisphere (both p values <0.05), the corresponding regions in the left hemisphere both showed nonsignificant interactions (both p values >0.41) and highly significant main effects of reward level (both p values <0.001; Figure 5B). These results suggested that social reward was processed in a similar manner to monetary reward, especially in the left caudate nucleus and putamen. The goals of the present study were to determine neurophysiologically whether a good reputation has a reward value and, if so, to verify whether this important social reward is processed in a neurally similar manner to monetary rewards.

However, little is known about the underlying neural representation of social hierarchies in humans. In the present study, we identify dissociable neural responses to perceived social rank using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an interactive, simulated social context. In both stable and unstable social hierarchies, viewing a superior individual differentially engaged perceptual-attentional, saliency, and cognitive systems, notably dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the unstable hierarchy setting, additional regions related to emotional processing (amygdala), social cognition (medial prefrontal cortex), and behavioral readiness were recruited. Furthermore, social hierarchical consequences of performance were neurally dissociable and of comparable salience to monetary reward, providing a neural basis for the high motivational value of status. Our results identify neural mechanisms that may mediate the enormous influence of social status on human behavior and health.

Our results identify neural mechanisms that may mediate the enormous influence of social status on human behavior and health. Human social hierarchies are prominent in different domestic, professional, and recreational settings, where they define implicit expectations and action dispositions that drive appropriate social behavior (Cummins, 2000Cummins D.D. How the social environment shaped the evolution of mind.Synthese. 2000; 122: 3-28Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in humans, social status strongly predicts well-being, morbidity, and even survival (Boyce, 2004Boyce W.T. Social stratification, health, and violence in the very young.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2004; 1036: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Sapolsky, 2004Sapolsky R.M. Social status and health in humans and other animals.Annu. Rev.

Festinger's long-standing, prominent theory of social comparison processes (Festinger, 1954Festinger L. A theory of social comparison processes.Hum. Relat. 1954; 7: 117-140Crossref Scopus (9824) Google Scholar) suggests an important role for hierarchical rank in achieving accurate self-knowledge and self-improvement, particularly in the usage of upward social comparisons, i.e., comparisons between oneself and an individual of higher status (Wheeler, 1966Wheeler L. Motivation as a determinant of upward comparison.J. Exp. Soc. Psychol. 1966; 2: 27-31Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Social hierarchies spontaneously and stably emerge in children as young as 2 years (Boyce, 2004Boyce W.T. Social stratification, health, and violence in the very young.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2004; 1036: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Cummins, 2000Cummins D.D. How the social environment shaped the evolution of mind.Synthese. 2000; 122: 3-28Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Status within a social hierarchy is often made explicit (e.g., via uniforms, honorifics, verbal assignment, or even in some languages via status-specific grammar [Pork, 1991Pork M.-R. Conflict avoidance in social interaction: A sociolinguistic comparison of the Korean and Japanese honorific systems.in: Hoji H. Japanese/Korean Linguistics. Vol. 1. CSLI Publications, Stanford1991Google Scholar]), but it can also be inferred from cues such as facial features, height, gender, age, and dress (Karafin et al., 2004Karafin M.S. Tranel D. Adolphs R. Dominance attributions following damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2004; 16: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In humans, dominance has been linked to heritable personality traits (Mehrabian, 1996Mehrabian A. Pleasure-arousal-dominance: A general framework for describing and measuring individual differences in temperament.Curr. Psychol. 1996; 14: 261-292Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar); furthermore, superior status interacts with multiple neurotransmitter (Moskowitz et al., 2001Moskowitz D.S. Pinard G. Zuroff D.C.

The influence of social hierarchy on primate health.Science. 2005; 308: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) systems and can be automatically and efficiently inferred (Moors and De Houwer, 2005Moors A. De Houwer J. Automatic processing of dominance and submissiveness.Exp. Psychol. 2005; 52: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating the existence of biological systems that process social rank information; yet, virtually nothing is known about the neural representations of social hierarchies in humans. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms that process social superiority and inferiority in humans. In human beings, social hierarchies can be established along various dimensions; we can be ranked according to ability or skill, as well as economic, physical, and professional standings. Here, in two experiments, we created an explicit and strongly reinforced social hierarchy based on incidental skill in the context of an interactive game (Figure 1). Participants performed a simple task for monetary reward simultaneously with one of two other players, alternatively, represented by photographs. Covertly, outcomes were fixed, and the two other players were simulated; behavioral measures (Figures S1 and S2, available online), however, confirmed that participants strongly engaged in this virtual social interaction. Just prior to the scanning session, in an initial test run, a social hierarchy was created by identifying the performance of one other player as better (“three star player”) and one other player as worse (“one star player”) than the participant (“two star player”). The star system, inspired by military rank symbols, continually reinforced the hierarchy by being displayed throughout the session. Implicit cues related to social superiority (e.g., age, gender, race, facial expression) were controlled. Importantly, participants played simultaneously with the other (simulated) players, but they did not play against each other. As such, outcomes and reward did not depend on the other player, who remained entirely inconsequential to the performed task and could have been completely ignored by a “rational” participant. The explicitly noncompetitive nature of the game ensured that the hierarchical status of the other player had no real or perceived impact on reward expectancy and task difficulty. Yet despite the game being noncompetitive with the other players, participants were strongly engaged in the hierarchical context, as is evident by postsession questionnaire data (Figures S1 and S2). In the first experiment (Figure 1A), we established a “stable hierarchy,” i.e., social rank positions were explicitly fixed initially and did not change throughout the experiment. We predicted differential neural responses related to processing the relative status of the other players. In a second experiment (Figure 1B), we created an “unstable hierarchy” setting by occasionally updating players' positions in the social hierarchy based on performance throughout the session. We expected to replicate our previous results from Experiment #1 regarding the neural representation of social status, but focused our primary interest on brain regions differentially active only in an unstable hierarchy setting. Moreover, we would now be able to examine the neural processing of outcomes that have a potential impact on relative social status. Finally, we examined the social specificity of our results through a nonsocial version of this experimental paradigm in which the (simulated) human players were replaced with computers. In the first experiment, the fMRI analysis revealed several brain regions differentially activated by viewing another individual of a particular relative status. Specifically, activity in the bilateral occipital/parietal cortex, ventral striatum, parahippocampal cortex, and dorsoateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly (p < 0.005, FDR-corrected) greater when viewing the more superior player compared with viewing the more inferior player (“superior player > inferior player”) relative to the participant in the interactive game (Figure 2 and Table 1). No brain regions were significantly (p < 0.05; FDR-corrected) more activated by viewing the inferior player compared with viewing the superior player (“inferior player > superior player”); while the aforementioned brain regions were significantly activated by viewing an inferior player relative to the implicit baseline (i.e., that part of measured blood oxygenation level-dependent [BOLD] response not accounted for by the modeled task-related activity), this activation was less than that for superior players (Figure 2B).Table 1Significantly Activated (p < 0.005, FDR-Corrected) Brain Regions for the Contrast, ‘Superior Player > Inferior Player’Brain RegionsBACluster Size (voxels)Peak MNI CoordinatesPeak Z ScorexyzStable Hierarchy: Experiment #1 R inferior parietal gyrus, incl.7/401341bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.36,−57,486.76 R inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/1942,−81,−66.16 L inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/19709bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.−24,−96,96.31 R precuneus759bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.6,−57,394.54 R inferior/middle frontal gyrus (DLPFC)9/4646542,30,214.50 L inferior/middle frontal gyrus (DLPFC)9133−36,3,424.48 R parahippocampal gyrus7027,−24,−123.71 L parahippocampal gyrus53−21,−27,−94.14 R ventral striatum, incl.936,18,−33.99 L ventral striatum−3,15,−63.72 L middle temporal gyrus2152−57,−51,−63.95Unstable Hierarchy: Experiment #2 R inferior/middle occipital gyrus, incl.18/19847bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.36,−93,37.03 L inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/19−27,−93,65.83 R inferior frontal gyrus (DLPFC)954bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.45,9,275.46 R thalamus, incl.207bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.6,−18,65.34 L thalamus−6,−18,154.68 R parahippocampal gyrus81bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.27,−21,−155.23 L parahippocampal gyrus77bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.−24,−27,−125.01 L precentral gyrus, incl.4/661bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.−39,−21,665.15 L postcentral gyrus1/2/3−51,−24,574.59 R ventral striatum53bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.9,9,−34.78 L fusiform3724bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.−27,−63,−184.81 R fusiform3723bCluster defined using p < 0.0005, FDR-corrected.45,−48,−184.57 R amygdala26aCluster defined using p < 0.001, FDR-corrected.24,−3,−214.34 posterior cingulate23/2931aCluster defined using p < 0.001, FDR-corrected.3,−42,214.25 medial prefrontal cortex9/10586,60,303.78 R superior parietal lobule7/405739,−51,663.63 supplementary motor area6643,−27,603.61 L posterior insula1361−45,−18,123.57L, left hemisphere; R, right hemisphere; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; BA, Brodmann area; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Italics indicate regions uniquely activated in Experiment #2. The fMRI results from Experiment #1 were replicated in Experiment #2. As when the hierarchy was stable, no brain regions were significantly (p < 0.05; FDR-corrected) more activated by viewing the inferior player as compared with the superior player (“inferior player > superior player”) in the unstable hierarchy setting; however, brain activity when viewing a more superior player, compared with viewing a more inferior player (“superior player > inferior player”), in the unstable hierarchy setting was again significantly greater in occipital/parietal cortex, ventral striatum, parahippocampal cortex, and DLPFC (Figure 3, Figure S3, and Table 1). In addition, several brain areas were uniquely recruited in the unstable hierarchy setting (Table 1, italic text). When viewing a superior player as compared with an inferior one, significant (p < 0.005; FDR-corrected) activations were also found in the bilateral thalamus, right amygdala, posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), primary motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA). Furthermore, we observed significant positive correlations (p < 0.05; two-tailed; Pearson's correlation) between the resultant activity in the thalamus (p = 0.011; r = 0.510), amygdala (p = 0.017; r = 0.481), and posterior cingulate (p = 0.018; r = 0.478) and the level of positive affect experienced by participants when in the top hierarchical position as assessed in postsession questionnaires (Figure 4). In Experiment #2, we also investigated the neural responses to various outcomes of interest (Table 2). Critically, we found that only outcomes with hierarchical value—that is, outcomes that potentially impact the participant's status relative to that of the other players (Figure S4)—elicited significant brain responses after controlling for reward (subject won or lost) and the status of the other player in the round (superior or inferior). Specifically, in response to an outcome of negative hierarchical value associated with performing worse than an inferior individual compared to the control outcome (“subject lost/inferior won > subject lost/inferior lost”) (Figure 5A; Table 2), significantly greater (p < 0.05; FDR-corrected) brain activity was observed in the bilateral occipital/parietal cortex, ventral striatum, midbrain/thalamus, and anterior insula. Our data demonstrated a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05; two-tailed, Pearson's correlation) between the level of positive affect experienced by the participant when he or she was in the top hierarchical position, and the resultant activity in the insula (p = 0.030; r = 0.444) and ventral striatum (p = 0.008; r = 0.528) associated with performing worse than the inferior player (Figure 5A). Conversely, a number of regions were significantly differentially activated (p < 0.05; FDR-corrected) by an outcome of positive hierarchical value associated with performing better than the superior player compared to the control condition (“subject won/superior lost > subject won/superior won”) (Figure 5B and Table 2), notably in the dorsal striatum, midbrain/thalamus, MPFC, dorsal premotor cortex, and pre-SMA. We observed significant negative correlations (p < 0.05; two-tailed; Pearson's correlation) between individual scores on the Trait Dominance-Submissiveness Scale (TDS) (Mehrabian, 1996Mehrabian A. Pleasure-arousal-dominance: A general framework for describing and measuring individual differences in temperament.Curr. Psychol. 1996; 14: 261-292Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and activity in premotor cortex (p = 0.04; r = −0.453) associated with performing better than the superior player (Figure 5B). Nonhierarchical valuable outcome contrasts (“subject lost/superior won > subject lost/superior lost” and “subject won/inferior lost > subject won/inferior won”) did not reveal any significant (p < 0.05; FDR-corrected) activations.Table 2Significantly Activated (p < 0.05, FDR-Corrected) Brain Regions during Specific Outcome Phases in Experiment #2Brain RegionsBACluster Size (voxels)Peak MNI CoordinatesPeak Z ScorexyzSub Lost/Inf Won > Sub Lost/Inf Lost R inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/194733,−87,94.40 L inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/1942−36,−90,−64.14 L ventral striatum, incl.127aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.−6,6,−34.11 R ventral striatum9,9,−34.01 midbrain, incl.143aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.−3,−30,−124.09 thalamus−6,−24,93.67 R inferior parietal lobule4022aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.39,−48,483.94 R fusiform3749aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.48,−60,−123.88 L anterior insula1365aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.−42,15,−63.77 R anterior insula1352aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.36,24,63.33Sub Lost/Sup Won > Sub Lost/Sup LostcNo significant activations (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected).Sub Won/Sup Lost > Sub Won/Sup Won pre-supplementary motor area6153bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.3,9,635.14 R precuneus7172bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.21,−87,425.10 L precuneus734bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.−9,−81,454.17 L precuneus7/1938bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.−24,−78,333.95 R inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/1954bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.45,−84,−64.58 L middle occipital gyrus1924bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.−48,−72,04.07 R inferior frontal/orbitofrontal4739bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.33,21,−184.38 medial prefrontal cortex630bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.3,42,394.06 R middle frontal gyrus (DPMC)650bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.45,0,423.96 L middle frontal gyrus (DPMC)6432−39,−6,573.93 anterior cingulate3229bCluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.9,42,183.84 L caudate26−6,6,93.98 L fusiform3722−36,−63,−183.88 R midbrain, incl.1549,−24,−63.81 R thalamus12,−18,63.68 L midbrain, incl.135−3,−21,−213.86 L thalamus−9,−21,93.57Sub Won/Inf Lost > Sub Won/Inf WoncNo significant activations (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected).L, left hemisphere; R, right hemisphere; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; BA, Brodmann area; DPMC, dorsal premotor cortex; sub, subject; inf, inferior player; sup, superior player.a Cluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.b Cluster defined using p < 0.02, FDR-corrected.c No significant activations (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected).

In order to assess the social specificity of the results from Experiment #2, we employed a nonsocial version of the experimental paradigm in which the other human players were replaced with two computers (Supplemental Methods)—a common method used in social cognition investigations (e.g., Spitzer et al., 2007Spitzer M. Fischbacher U. Herrnberger B. Gron G. Fehr E. The neural signature of social norm compliance.Neuron. 2007; 56: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The fMRI results from the nonsocial control experiment are displayed in Table 3. In several regions, viewing a superior compared with an inferior other player in the nonsocial paradigm elicited significant activations (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected), which, although less extensive, were similar to some of those resulting in the social paradigm, namely those in the occipital cortex, ventral striatum, parahippocampal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and SMA. These common activations, therefore, could not be exclusively attributed to the social nature of the task (although we cannot exclude that anthropomorphization of the computer players could have contributed to the overlap). However, several unique activations in other regions clearly distinguished the social paradigm from the nonsocial paradigm. Specifically, viewing a superior player compared with an inferior player activated the DLPFC, amygdala, thalamus, posterior cingulate, and MPFC in the social setting only; these regions were not significantly activated (p > 0.05, FDR-corrected) in the nonsocial task. Furthermore, all of the aforementioned activations following hierarchical valuable outcomes compared with their control outcome conditions were social specific, with the exception of activity in the occipital cortex in the negative hierarchical valuable outcome contrast, “subject lost/inferior won > subject lost/inferior lost,” which also resulted in the nonsocial control condition (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected).Table 3Significantly Activated (p < 0.05, FDR-Corrected) Brain Regions in the Nonsocial Control Paradigm (Experiment #3)Brain RegionsBACluster Size (voxels)Peak MNI CoordinatesPeak Z ScorexyzSuperior Player > Inferior Player L precentral gyrus, incl.4838−36,−30,694.35 L postcentral gyrus1/2/3−48,−30,604.25 L inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/19476aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.−27,−96,−154.02 R inferior/middle occipital gyrus18/19395aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.30,−84,273.89 supplementary motor area6129aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.0,−3,544.04 L insula13385−42,0,33.63 R insula1314542,0,33.32 R parahippocampal gyrus50aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.18,−27,−93.76 L ventral striatum160−9,12,03.52 R ventral striatum30aCluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.9,15,−33.59Sub Lost/Inf Won > Sub Lost/Inf Lost L inferior occipital gyrus18/19359bCluster defined using p < 0.005, FDR-corrected.−36,−78,−155.56 L middle occipital gyrus18/1979bCluster defined using p < 0.005, FDR-corrected.−33,−90,124.54 R middle occipital gyrus19101bCluster defined using p < 0.005, FDR-corrected.36,−84,155.11 R fusiform gyrus3779bCluster defined using p < 0.005, FDR-corrected.30,−63,−154.69 R precuneus736bCluster defined using p < 0.005, FDR-corrected.21,−72484.34Sub Won/Sup Lost > Sub Won/Sup WoncNo significant activations.L, left hemisphere; R, right hemisphere; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; BA, Brodmann area; sub, subject; inf, inferior player; sup, superior player.a Cluster defined using p < 0.001, uncorrected.b Cluster defined using p < 0.005, FDR-corrected.c No significant activations.

In addition to this specific neural signature, the social and nonsocial paradigms were dissociable behaviorally as well (Figure S5). In postsession questionnaires, participants reported being significantly more influenced/motivated by the other players in the social experiment compared with the nonsocial experiment [p = 0.023; t(46) = 2.351; two-tailed; t test]. Additionally, it was significantly [p = 0.007; t(45) = 2.823; two-tailed; t test] more important for participants to perform better than the superior player in the social compared with the nonsocial paradigm. In the present study, we identified pronounced differential neural responses based on status when viewing another individual, despite the fact that status was irrelevant for the game outcome. Hierarchical status can be either fixed or changeable, and this aspect of social stratification has pronounced implications for individuals. In nonhuman and human primates, the more subordinate position in stable social hierarchies is associated with greater stress, whereas in dynamic hierarchies, the dominant position experiences the most stressors due to increased competition and instability (Sapolsky, 2004Sapolsky R.M. Social status and health in humans and other animals.Annu. Rev. Anthropol. 2004; 33: 393-418Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar, Sapolsky, 2005Sapolsky R.M. The influence of social hierarchy on primate health.Science. 2005; 308: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) during times of reorganization, and may be at greater health risks (Sapolsky, 2004Sapolsky R.M. Social status and health in humans and other animals.Annu. Rev. Anthropol. 2004; 33: 393-418Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To address neural differences in processing stable and unstable hierarchical information, we modulated hierarchy stability in two experiments. Importantly, in addition to hierarchy stability, we also investigated social specificity using a nonsocial control experiment, allowing for the separation between the neural processing of general hierarchical information (i.e., ranked relative to an inanimate entity) and social hierarchical information (i.e., ranked relative to other human beings). In all hierarchical settings (stable, unstable, and nonsocial), brain activity when viewing a more superior player compared with viewing a more inferior player was significantly greater in occipital/parietal cortex, ventral striatum, and parahippocampal cortex, implicating these brain areas in the neural encoding of hierarchical rank, irrespective of the stability or specifically social nature of the hierarchy. Activity in the occipital/parietal cortex and ventral striatum indicates greater perceptual/attentional processing (Bradley et al., 2003Bradley M.M. Sabatinelli D. Lang P.J. Fitzsimmons J.R. King W. Desai P. Activation of the visual cortex in motivated attention.Behav. Neurosci. 2003; 117: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and salience (Zink et al., 2006Zink C.F. Pagnoni G. Chappelow J. Martin-Skurski M. Berns G.S. Human striatal activation reflects degree of stimulus saliency.Neuroimage. 2006; 29: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), respectively, associated with the superior player, in excellent agreement with data on preferential attentional capture by high-rank individuals in monkeys (Deaner et al., 2005Deaner R.O. Khera A.V. Platt M.L. Monkeys pay per view: adaptive valuation of social images by rhesus macaques.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 543-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Increased activity in the parahippocampal cortex, a region shown to play a central role in contextual associative processing (Aminoff et al., 2007Aminoff E. Gronau N. Bar M. The parahippocampal cortex mediates spatial and nonspatial associations.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), is suggestive of preferred contextual episodic encoding of the association between the superior rank status and the player's picture. While these regions did not appear to differentiate between social and nonsocial hierarchical information, the DLPFC activation to the superior versus inferior player was only seen in a social context, i.e., human other players, suggesting that the involvement of DLPFC in processing hierarchical information is specifically social. Our data support the notion that the DLPFC plays a role in making interpersonal judgments, including the assessment of social status (Mah et al., 2004Mah L. Arnold M.C. Grafman J. Impairment of social perception associated with lesions of the prefrontal cortex.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2004; 161: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DLPFC has been implicated in social norm compliance (Spitzer et al., 2007Spitzer M. Fischbacher U. Herrnberger B. Gron G. Fehr E. The neural signature of social norm compliance.Neuron. 2007; 56: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), a process that is strongly influenced by perceived social rank (Cummins, 2000Cummins D.D. How the social environment shaped the evolution of mind.Synthese. 2000; 122: 3-28Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In accordance with the social specificity of DLPFC activity resulting here, the DLPFC's role in social norm compliance was significantly more pronounced in a social context as compared with a nonsocial context (Spitzer et al., 2007Spitzer M.

Interestingly, the social unstable hierarchical setting elicited multiple neural responses not produced with the other hierarchical settings (stable and nonsocial). Viewing a superior player compared with an inferior player in the social unstable hierarchy setting resulted in increases of activity in multiple areas linked with social emotional processing and social cognition.

https://openalex.org/W1988037421,"Homozygous deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most frequent genetic cause of early childhood lethality. In rare instances, however, individuals are asymptomatic despite carrying the same SMN1 mutations as their affected siblings, thereby suggesting the influence of modifier genes. We discovered that unaffected SMN1-deleted females exhibit significantly higher expression of plastin 3 (PLS3) than their SMA-affected counterparts. We demonstrated that PLS3 is important for axonogenesis through increasing the F-actin level. Overexpression of PLS3 rescued the axon length and outgrowth defects associated with SMN down-regulation in motor neurons of SMA mouse embryos and in zebrafish. Our study suggests that defects in axonogenesis are the major cause of SMA, thereby opening new therapeutic options for SMA and similar neuromuscular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2078889033,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the cerebral correlates of motor sequence memory consolidation. Participants were scanned while training on an implicit oculomotor sequence learning task and during a single testing session taking place 30 min, 5 hr, or 24 hr later. During training, responses observed in hippocampus and striatum were linearly related to the gain in performance observed overnight, but not over the day. Responses in both structures were significantly larger at 24 hr than at 30 min or 5 hr. Additionally, the competitive interaction observed between these structures during training became cooperative overnight. These results stress the importance of both hippocampus and striatum in procedural memory consolidation. Responses in these areas during training seem to condition the overnight memory processing that is associated with a change in their functional interactions. These results show that both structures interact during motor sequence consolidation to optimize subsequent behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2012582486,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan in the extracellular matrix whose expression is tightly linked to multidrug resistance and tumor progression. In this study we investigated HA-induced interaction between CD44 (a HA receptor) and Nanog (an embryonic stem cell transcription factor) in both human breast tumor cells (MCF-7 cells) and human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cells). Using a specific primer pair to amplify Nanog by reverse transcriptase-PCR, we detected the expression of Nanog transcript in both tumor cell lines. In addition, our results reveal that HA binding to these tumor cells promotes Nanog protein association with CD44 followed by Nanog activation and the expression of pluripotent stem cell regulators (e.g. Rex1 and Sox2). Nanog also forms a complex with the ""signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3"" (Stat-3) in the nucleus leading to Stat-3-specific transcriptional activation and multidrug transporter, MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) gene expression. Furthermore, we observed that HA-CD44 interaction induces ankyrin (a cytoskeletal protein) binding to MDR1 resulting in the efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. doxorubicin and paclitaxel (Taxol)) and chemoresistance in these tumor cells. Overexpression of Nanog by transfecting tumor cells with Nanog cDNA stimulates Stat-3 transcriptional activation, MDR1 overexpression, and multidrug resistance. Down regulation of Nanog signaling or ankyrin function (by transfecting tumor cells with Nanog small interfering RNA or ankyrin repeat domain cDNA) not only blocks HA/CD44-mediated tumor cell behaviors but also enhances chemosensitivity. Taken together, these findings suggest that targeting HA/CD44-mediated Nanog-Stat-3 signaling pathways and ankyrin/cytoskeleton function may represent a novel approach to overcome chemotherapy resistance in some breast and ovarian tumor cells displaying stem cell marker properties during tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2117112155,"We recently identified a class of membrane proteins, the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, which shape the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in yeast and mammalian cells. These proteins are highly enriched in the tubular portions of the ER and virtually excluded from other regions. To understand how they promote tubule formation, we characterized their behavior in cellular membranes and addressed how their localization in the ER is determined. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we found that yeast Rtn1p and Yop1p are less mobile in the membrane than normal ER proteins. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and cross-linking analyses show that they form oligomers. Mutants of yeast Rtn1p, which no longer localize exclusively to the tubular ER or are even totally inactive in inducing ER tubules, are more mobile and oligomerize less extensively. The mammalian reticulons and DP1 are also relatively immobile and can form oligomers. The conserved reticulon homology domain that includes the two membrane-embedded segments is sufficient for the localization of the reticulons to the tubular ER, as well as for their diffusional immobility and oligomerization. Finally, ATP depletion in both yeast and mammalian cells further decreases the mobilities of the reticulons and DP1. We propose that oligomerization of the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p is important for both their localization to the tubular domains of the ER and for their ability to form tubules."
https://openalex.org/W2078063564,"The neuropeptide PDF is released by sixteen clock neurons in Drosophila and helps maintain circadian activity rhythms by coordinating a network of ∼150 neuronal clocks. Whether PDF acts directly on elements of this neural network remains unknown. We address this question by adapting Epac1-camps, a genetically encoded cAMP FRET sensor, for use in the living brain. We find that a subset of the PDF-expressing neurons respond to PDF with long-lasting cAMP increases and confirm that such responses require the PDF receptor. In contrast, an unrelated Drosophila neuropeptide, DH31, stimulates large cAMP increases in all PDF-expressing clock neurons. Thus, the network of ∼150 clock neurons displays widespread, though not uniform, PDF receptivity. This work introduces a sensitive means of measuring cAMP changes in a living brain with subcellular resolution. Specifically, it experimentally confirms the longstanding hypothesis that PDF is a direct modulator of most neurons in the Drosophila clock network."
https://openalex.org/W2064215739,"Most materials shrink laterally like a rubber band when stretched, so their Poisson's ratios are positive. Likewise, most materials contract in all directions when hydrostatically compressed and decrease density when stretched, so they have positive linear compressibilities. We found that the in-plane Poisson's ratio of carbon nanotube sheets (buckypaper) can be tuned from positive to negative by mixing single-walled and multiwalled nanotubes. Density-normalized sheet toughness, strength, and modulus were substantially increased by this mixing. A simple model predicts the sign and magnitude of Poisson's ratio for buckypaper from the relative ease of nanofiber bending and stretch, and explains why the Poisson's ratios of ordinary writing paper are positive and much larger. Theory also explains why the negative in-plane Poisson's ratio is associated with a large positive Poisson's ratio for the sheet thickness, and predicts that hydrostatic compression can produce biaxial sheet expansion. This tunability of Poisson's ratio can be exploited in the design of sheet-derived composites, artificial muscles, gaskets, and chemical and mechanical sensors."

The murine cytomegalovirus M45 protein interacts with receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 1 and RIP3 via a RIP homotypic interaction motif. Cell death suppression by M45 requires RIP homotypic interaction motif-dependent interaction with RIP1. This interaction also underlies the cell tropism role of M45 in preventing premature death of endothelial cells during murine cytomegalovirus infection. Thus, M45 is a viral inhibitor of RIP activation that provides a direct cell type-dependent replication benefit to the virus while modulating other biological processes signaling via the RIP1 adaptor such as activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 as well as other mediators of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1971419973,"Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) misfolding is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes mellitus. It has recently been shown that membranes can catalyze the misfolding of hIAPP via an α-helical intermediate of unknown structure. To better understand the mechanism of membrane-mediated misfolding, we used site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy to generate a three-dimensional structural model of this membrane-bound form. We find that hIAPP forms a single α-helix encompassing residues 9–22. The helix is flanked by N- and C-terminal regions that do not take up a clearly detectable secondary structure and are less ordered.

Anchoring hIAPP to the membrane not only increases the local concentration but also reduces the encounter between peptides to essentially a two-dimensional process. It is significant to note that the α-helical membrane-bound form leaves much of an important amyloidogenic region of hIAPP (residues 20–29) exposed for misfolding.

Protein misfolding and amyloid fibril formation are common characteristics of a number of debilitating human diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and type II diabetes mellitus (1Soto C.

A number of findings support the notion that hIAPP misfolding plays an important role in disease. Approximately 95% of all patients with type II diabetes mellitus have large extracellular deposits composed of fibrillar hIAPP (2Hull R.L. Westermark G.T. Westermark P. Kahn S.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Mouse and rat IAPP do not misfold and are not toxic to cultured cells, suggesting that misfolding is a prerequisite for IAPP toxicity.

Like other amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, hIAPP misfolds via a nucleation-dependent aggregation pathway in which small oligomeric assemblies precede the formation of mature amyloid fibrils (14Caughey B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 671-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that hIAPP interacts with negatively charged membranes and that this interaction can dramatically accelerate misfolding, which reduces the time of aggregation and fibril formation from days to just a few minutes under optimal conditions (24Knight J.D. Miranker A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 29Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12113-12119Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The degree of acceleration strongly depends on ionic strength and the density of negatively charged lipids, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are important for membrane-mediated aggregation. Circular dichroism (CD) and thioflavin T fluorescence data have demonstrated that this membrane-mediated misfolding occurs via an α-helical intermediate (29Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12113-12119Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Knight J.D. Hebda J.A. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9496-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that ∼15–20 amino acids participate in α-helix formation. What remains unknown, however, are the structure of this α-helical form, the number of helices that are formed, the specific residues that participate in helix formation, and the membrane topography. Here, we employed a combination of site-directed spin labeling, EPR spectroscopy, and molecular modeling to generate a three-dimensional model of α-helical, membrane-bound hIAPP. We found that membrane-bound hIAPP has a central helical region from residue 9 to residue 22, whereas the N- and C-terminal regions are much less ordered. This structure leaves much of the highly amyloidogenic stretch from residue 20 to residue 29 exposed for misfolding and β-sheet formation. Preparation of Spin-labeled hIAPP Derivatives—Spin-labeled hIAPP derivatives were generated through specific cysteine labeling. As in our previous study, the native cysteine residues at positions 2 and 7 were substituted with alanine (31Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48420-48425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Using CD and thioflavin T fluorescence, we verified that this Cys-less hIAPP had aggregation properties similar to that of wild type. Single-cysteine mutants were generated using peptide synthesis and obtained from Biomer Technology, LLC (Concord, CA). Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in DMSO and Milli-Q water and were reacted with 3× molar excess of the MTSL spin label ((1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate) for 1 h at room temperature. Excess spin label was removed using a Toyopearl cation exchange chromatography column (Tosoh Corp.) from which hIAPP was eluted with 6 m guanidine HCl (Pierce). Subsequently, C-18 Macro SpinColumns (Harvard Apparatus) were used for desalting, and, finally, hIAPP was eluted with hexafluoroisopropanol. Samples were then aliquoted and lyophilized to achieve the desired final concentrations. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles—In the present study, we used large unilamellar vesicles containing 80% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine) (POPS) and 20% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (mol/mol) (Avanti Polar Lipids). The individual lipids, dissolved in chloroform, were mixed to obtain a total final concentration of 100 mm after rehydration. Next, the lipid mixture was dried under a stream of nitrogen and desiccated overnight. The dried lipid film was rehydrated in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, to obtain a concentration of 100 mm lipid. After repeated freeze-thawing (five times), the vesicles were extruded using 0.1 μm polycarbonate membranes (Avanti Polar Lipids) to obtain 100-nm diameter lipid vesicles. Structural Analysis of Spin-labeled IAPP Derivatives—Lyophilized spin-labeled peptides were incubated with large unilamellar vesicles at a 1:1000 molar ratio in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. A Jasco circular dichroism J-810 spectrometer (Easton, MD) was used to confirm the formation of α-helical structure for the spin-labeled hIAPP derivatives in the presence of membranes. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) EMX spectrometer fitted with an HS resonator at 12-milliwatt incident microwave power. Central line widths were obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak distance for the maxima and minima of the central line. The O2 and chelated nickel (nickel(II)-ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid) (NiEDDA) accessibilities (ΠO2 and ΠNiEDDA) were determined by employing the commonly used power saturation method (32Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The concentration of NiEDDA was 40 mm, and the concentration of O2 was that of air in equilibrium with buffer. Depth Calibration and Analysis of Φ Parameter—The membrane immersion depth of R1 at different sites was calibrated using the previously established relationship that d[Å] = aΦ + b, where Φ = ln(ΠO2/Π(NiEDDA). The a and b parameters were obtained using calibration with 1-palmitoyl-2-stereoyl-(n-DOXYL)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) harboring spin labels at the 5, 7, and 10 positions on the acyl chains, as described previously (32Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Using the spin-labeled phosphatidylcholines specified above, we found that a = 6.5 and b = 3.5. Mobility Analysis Reveals Local Structural Ordering upon Membrane Interaction—To obtain detailed structural information on the α-helical, membrane-bound form of hIAPP, we generated 29 R1-labeled derivatives of hIAPP and recorded the EPR spectra of each spin-labeled derivative in solution and when bound to phospholipid membranes. As shown for the representative example of 9R1 (hIAPP labeled at position 9), the EPR spectra of all freshly dissolved derivatives are characterized by sharp and narrowly spaced lines that are indicative of high mobility (Fig. 1A, gray). These spectra are in agreement with previous data (31Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48420-48425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and reflect the highly dynamic structure of the fast tumbling, monomeric hIAPP. To record the EPR spectra of α-helical, membrane-bound hIAPP, it was important to choose conditions under which no aggregation or β-sheet formation would occur during the time course of the EPR measurements (several minutes). It had previously been shown that the α-helical form can be trapped kinetically and kept stable for several hours at low ionic strength in the presence of highly negatively charged vesicles (29Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12113-12119Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Under such conditions (80%POPS/20% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), we generated the membrane-bound, α-helical form of all spin-labeled derivatives. As shown for the example of 9R1 in Fig. 1A (black), membrane interaction causes a significant reduction in mobility, as indicated by the broadened lines and the concomitant reduction in signal amplitude. This spectral change reflects reduced tumbling and increased structural ordering upon membrane interaction. No spectral change could be observed over a period of 4 h (Fig. 1A, red), in agreement with CD and thioflavin data indicating that the α-helical structure remains stable for at least 24 h before misfolding and aggregation occurs (data not shown). The EPR spectra of the α-helical, membrane-bound forms of all 29 spin-labeled hIAPP derivatives are shown in Fig. 1B. Although membrane interaction causes a reduction in mobility at all sites, the degree of this immobilization varies from site to site. The most pronounced ordering can be observed for residues 9–20. Spectra for these sites have characteristic line shapes and inverse central line width values (between 0.26 and 0.32 Gauss–1) typically observed on surfaces of ordered structures (Fig. 2). In contrast, the soluble peptides have inverse central line width values between 0.62 and 0.68 Gauss–1. Despite the clear decrease in mobility, none of these spectra exhibit any strongly immobilized components that would typically be observed at buried sites. Thus, residues 9–20 do not exhibit strong tertiary or quaternary packing interactions. Although some reduction in mobility can also be observed for sites in the N- and C-terminal regions, those sites still contain components of high mobility, indicating a less ordered state. Accessibility Analysis Reveals the Formation of an Amphipathic Helix That Is Located Parallel to the Membrane Surface—Although the mobility data indicate the ordering of a central region, they do not provide information as to secondary structure or membrane topography. To obtain such information, we determined the accessibility of all spin-labeled sites to the paramagnetic colliders O2 and NiEDDA. These measurements are based on the fact that the hydrophobic O2 preferentially partitions into the membrane, whereas the more hydrophilic NiEDDA preferentially partitions into the solvent (33Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). As a consequence, membrane-exposed sites become more O2-accessible whereas solvent-exposed sites exhibit preferential NiEDDA accessibility. The accessibilities to O2 and NiEDDA (ΠO2 and ΠNiEDDA, respectively) for all membrane-bound IAPP derivatives are shown in the top panels of Fig. 3A and are summarized by the contrast parameter Φ (Φ = ln(ΠO2/Π (NiEDDA)). Highlighted in gray is a central region from residue 9 to residue 22. The unique feature of this region is the presence of an extensive stretch of highly periodic oscillations that are perfectly out of phase for the O2 and NiEDDA accessibilities. The period of the oscillation indicates an α-helical structure, as maxima and minima are typically spaced three or four residues apart for such structures. The out of phase periodicity of the respective accessibilities reveals an asymmetric solvation in which one face is exposed to the membrane (high ΠO2), while the other face is exposed to the solvent (high Π NiEDDA). The notion of an asymmetrically solvated α-helix is further supported by the Φ plot that also reveals the α-helical oscillations for residues 9–22. When residues 9–22 are plotted on an α-helical wheel, it becomes apparent that the most deeply membrane-embedded residues (Fig. 3B, local Φ maxima, red) fall into the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic α-helix, whereas the solvent-exposed residues fall into the hydrophilic face (local Φ minima, blue). The formation of an α-helical structure is also in good agreement with the mobility analysis that identified residues 9–20 as the most ordered sites. Only residues 21 and 22 exhibit elevated mobility, suggesting that the C-terminal end of the α-helix is likely to be frayed and more dynamic. It has been well established that Φ values are directly proportional to the membrane insertion depth and that it is possible to calibrate the immersion depth through the use of spin-labeled lipids (32Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have found that the most lipid-exposed sites (positions 9, 12, 16, and 20) are at a relatively constant immersion depth of ∼16 Å. Similar immersion depths are characteristic of a peripherally bound peptide rather than of a transmembrane helix. In the latter case, the immersion depth would be maximal in the center of the helix and would decrease toward the N- and C-terminal regions. Furthermore, the short stretch of ∼14 amino acids from residue 9 to residue 22 would be too short to span the bilayer. Thus, the data are not consistent with the formation of a transmembrane helix but rather with an α-helix that is parallel to the membrane surface. When building structural models, it is important to consider that the measured immersion depths represent those of the N-O moiety of the R1 side chain. According to crystallographic studies, this group is located ∼7–10 Å away from the center of the α-helix (34Langen R. Oh K.J. Cascio D. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8396-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We can therefore estimate that the center of the helix is located at an immersion depth of 6–9 Å below the level of the phosphate groups. The structure of residues 9–22 is schematically indicated in Fig. 4A; the N- and C-terminal regions are not shown because the EPR data did not detect any specifically ordered structure in these regions. It is noteworthy that Arg-11 and His-18 (which is likely to be protonated when in the interfacial region) are located in positions that maximize electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged head-groups/phosphates. Moreover, Phe-15 is located close to the level of the phosphates, a position thought to be favored by aromatic side chains of membrane proteins (35White S.H. Wimley W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Collectively, these interactions might contribute to the observed immersion depth of the helix. The present study has employed EPR spectroscopy of 29 different spin-labeled hIAPP derivatives and structural modeling to obtain detailed structural information on membrane-bound hIAPP (Fig. 4A). Mobility and accessibility analyses have revealed the formation of an α-helical structure from residue 9 to residue 22, whereas the N- and C-terminal regions are less ordered and do not exhibit a clearly detectable secondary structure. The central amphipathic α-helix runs parallel to the membrane and, according to mobility analysis, shows little tertiary and quaternary packing interactions suggesting the formation of a single, predominantly monomeric helix. Previous predictions of membrane-bound hIAPP using MPEx revealed that an α-helix composed of residues 10–27 has the highest hydrophobicity and amphipathicity in hIAPP (29Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12113-12119Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The α-helical region defined in the present study is entirely contained in this previously identified stretch, but, importantly, it lacks the C-terminal amino acids (residues 23–27). A likely explanation for the somewhat shorter helical structure identified in the present study is the local difference in helical propensity. According to PredictProtein, residues 10–17 exhibit the strongest propensity for α-helix formation whereas residues 18–37 have only weak helical propensities. In fact, a recent NMR study of rat IAPP revealed that the helical residues identified in the present study can take up partial helical structure in aqueous solution (36Williamson J.A. Miranker A.D. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The present structural information has important implications for the mechanism of aggregation. Residues 20–29 of hIAPP have long been considered a highly amyloidogenic region, and a peptide containing these residues has been shown to readily form amyloid fibrils (37Moriarty D.F. Raleigh D.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Tenidis K. Waldner M. Bernhagen J. Fischle W. Bergmann M. Weber M. Merkle M.L. Voelter W. Brunner H. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1055-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 39Westermark P. Engstrèom U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5036-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). This region also exhibits the largest sequence variations between hIAPP and rat IAPP, which does not readily form amyloid fibrils due to prolines at positions 25, 28, and 29. Our finding that residues 23–37 do not take up a detectable secondary structure and that residues 21 and 22 exhibit elevated mobility reveals that much of this highly amyloidogenic region (as well as the residual C-terminal region) is poorly folded upon membrane interaction. This result is of particular significance because membrane interaction typically facilitates the formation of secondary structure, including that of β-sheet structure (40Wimley W.C. Hristova K. Ladokhin A.S. Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. White S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1091-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of α-helical, membrane-bound hIAPP exposes a highly amyloidogenic stretch of hIAPP to an environment that is expected to promote the formation of misfolded β-sheet structures. Moreover, membrane interaction also increases the local concentration of hIAPP and reduces the dimensionality of the encounter between multiple hIAPP molecules, which effectively becomes a two-dimensional process. The combination of these factors is likely to be responsible for the pronounced acceleration of membrane-mediated hIAPP misfolding. Recently, it was concluded that α-helical, membrane-bound hIAPP can form helical oligomers at high protein-to-lipid ratios, and it was suggested that these α-helical oligomers could then transition into β-sheet-containing misfolded forms (30Knight J.D. Hebda J.A. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9496-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). When combined with the present data, a likely mechanism for aggregation and misfolding would be the initiation of β-sheet formation in the C terminus of such helical bundles or other transient complexes (Fig. 4C). This notion is further supported by the finding that rat IAPP, which also forms an α-helical structure on membranes, contains three prolines in the critical region (residues 20–29) and does not undergo membrane-mediated misfolding. Similarly, truncated hIAPP containing residues 1–24 readily takes up an α-helical structure but does not readily undergo membrane-mediated aggregation, as judged by thioflavin T fluorescence. 3M. Apostolidou and R. Langen, unpublished results. Subsequent to the formation of the initial, presumably α-helix- and β-sheet-containing, oligomers, the α-helical structure must then be lost, because previous CD analysis shows that gain of β-sheet structure coincides with the loss of α-helical structure. Furthermore, it is now well established that the β-sheet-containing core region of hIAPP fibrils extends well beyond residues 20–29 and includes most, if not all, of the residues that participate in α-helix formation (29Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12113-12119Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 41Luca S. Yau W.M. Leapman R. Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13505-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Our previous study revealed that the most rapid aggregation occurs at a POPS percentage of 25%. These data are consistent with the model in Fig. 4A, wherein the α-helical form represents a transient intermediate. In the concentration range between 0 and 25% POPS, an increase in the amount of POPS increases the amount of α-helix formation and thereby promotes misfolding via the mechanism shown in Fig. 4C. At higher concentrations of POPS, such as those used in the present study, the α-helical form becomes increasingly more stable. This stabilization should inhibit the transition from mixed α/β oligomers to predominantly β-sheet oligomers. In cells, the density of POPS (or other negatively charged lipids) varies significantly but is typically less than 25%. Consequently, we expect that the α-helical form described here will be rather short-lived and, presumably, will readily transition into the misfolded state. Such a mechanism should be particularly important for cytosolic hIAPP (7O'Brien T.D. Butler P.C. Kreutter D.K. Kane L.A. Eberhardt N.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar, 9Janson J. Soeller W.C. Roche P.C. Nelson R.T. Torchia A.J. Kreutter D.K. Butler P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We performed invasive cardiac hemodynamic measurements in F2 crosses between spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats and reference strains. We combined linkage analyses with genome-wide expression profiling and identified Ephx2 as a heart failure susceptibility gene in SHHF rats. Specifically, we found that cis variation at Ephx2 segregated with heart failure and with increased transcript expression, protein expression and enzyme activity, leading to a more rapid hydrolysis of cardioprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. To confirm our results, we tested the role of Ephx2 in heart failure using knockout mice. Ephx2 gene ablation protected from pressure overload-induced heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. We further demonstrated differential regulation of EPHX2 in human heart failure, suggesting a cross-species role for Ephx2 in this complex disease."

However, ChIP and transfection analyses revealed that RORα is recruited to and regulates the activity of the SREBP-1c promoter. Furthermore, the lean phenotype in sg/sg mice is also characterized by significantly increased expression of PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and lipin1 mRNA in liver and white and brown adipose tissue from sg/sg mice. In addition, we observed a significant 4-fold increase in β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA in brown adipose tissue. Finally, dysfunctional RORα expression protects against diet-induced obesity. Following a 10-week high fat diet, wild-type but not sg/sg mice exhibited a ∼20% weight gain, increased hepatic triglycerides, and notable white and brown adipose tissue accumulation. In summary, these changes in gene expression (that modulate lipid homeostasis) in metabolic tissues are involved in decreased adiposity and resistance to diet-induced obesity in the sg/sg mice, despite hyperphagia.

The sg mutation has been shown to be an intragenic deletion in the coding region of RORα, removing an exon downstream of the DNA binding domain (4Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W.

RORα transcript levels are significantly reduced in staggerer (sg/sg) mice, and it has been clearly demonstrated that the sg phenotype is associated with the expression of dysfunctional RORα (9Dussault I. Fawcett D. Matthyssen A. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mech. Dev. 1998; 70: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, RORα-deficient mice display many aspects of the staggerer phenotype (9Dussault I. Fawcett D. Matthyssen A. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mech.

Previously, Vu Dac et al. (12Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Grotzinger T. De Vos P. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22401-22404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) established that apoA1 is directly regulated by RORα1-mediated trans-activation. Moreover, sg/sg mice are susceptible to atherosclerosis on an atherogenic diet (11Mamontova A. Seguret-Mace S. Esposito B. Chaniale C. Bouly M. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Luc G. Staels B. Duverger N. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2738-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that RORα is involved in the regulation of lipoprotein homeostasis in mice. Subsequently, Raspe et al. (13Raspe E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fievet C. Fruchart J.C. Besnard S. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), showed that female sg/sg mice have reduced plasma triglycerides, coupled to concordant decreases in apolipoprotein C-III (apoCIII) mRNA expression in liver and (proximal and distal) intestine. In this context a study from our laboratory, using an in vitro skeletal muscle cell culture model, demonstrated that overexpression of RORα1 (lacking the ligand binding domain) results in reduced sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1, isoform c (SREBP-1c) mRNA expression (14Lau P. Nixon S.J. Parton R.G. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36828-36840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These studies have underscored the pertinent role of RORα in lipid homeostasis. RORα is abundantly expressed in the liver and the other major mass peripheral metabolic tissues. Moreover, sg/sg mice consume an increased amount of food (per gram bodyweight), but, despite this feeding pattern, they maintain a lower weight (15Bertin R. Guastavino J.M. Portet R. Physiol. Behav. 1990; 47: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Guastavino J.M. Bertin R. Portet R. Physiol. Behav. 1991; 49: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no studies have investigated this aspect of the staggerer phenotype. Hence, we were particularly interested in elucidating the functional role of RORα in the control of genes that regulate lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissues in homozygous sg/sg mice. We hypothesized, based on our in vitro studies, that SREBP-1c may be a critical component in the metabolic phenotype of sg/sg mice. We observed that sg/sg mice displayed an early onset decrease in weight that was maintained after maturity and associated with decreased adiposity. The mice (expressing dysfunctional RORα) displayed reduced serum and hepatic lipids, consistent with decreased ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1), ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 1 (ABCG1), SREBP-1c, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA expression in the liver. ChIP and transfection analyses showed that RORα mediated trans-activation of the SREBP-1c promoter. Candidate-based expression profiling in sg/sg mice demonstrated increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, coactivator 1 (PGC-1α/β) and lipin1 gene expression in liver and white and brown adipose tissue. These genes increase fatty acid utilization and oxidative metabolism. Interestingly, the sg/sg mice did not accumulate fat and were resistant to diet-induced obesity, despite hyperphagia. In summary, our study suggests RORα is an important factor in the regulation of genes associated with lipid homeostasis and adiposity. Animals and Tissue Collection—Heterozygous +/sg mice, B6.C3(Cg)-Rorasg/J, were obtained from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and the colony was maintained by backcrossing to C57BL/6J. Identification was carried out by PCR genotyping as described by Jackson laboratory. The mice were housed in Queensland Bioscience Precinct vivarium (University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia) with a 12-h light-dark cycle and fed a standard diet containing 4.6% total fat or a high fat diet (SF01-028) containing 22.6% fat (both from Specialty Feeds, Glen Forrest, Western Australia). Homozygous sg/sg mice and their wild-type (wt) littermates were obtained by crossing heterozygous male and female breeders. The mice were weaned at 4 weeks of age but were fed with moist mash standard diet ad libitum as described by Guastavino (17Guastavino J.M. C. R. Acad. Sci. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. D. 1978; 286: 137-139PubMed Google Scholar) in the final week prior to weaning and thereafter postweaning. High fat fed animals were similarly provided with moist, mashed pellets and diluted, food grade strawberry flavoring to improve palatability. Access to water was facilitated by adding dishes of water and hanging gel packs (Able Scientific, Welshpool, Western Australia) in each cage. Experimental animals were weighed weekly. Mice were fasted for 6 h by transferring to a new food-free holding cage with unrestricted access to water. Blood collection was performed by terminal cardiac puncture, under isoflurane anesthesia. Otherwise animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation at 14 weeks of age. Tissues collected for RNA extraction were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C. For histological examination, tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich), paraffin-embedded, and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All aspects of animal experimentation were approved by The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as previously described, with minor modifications. Following homogenization with a handheld ultra-turrax homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany), total RNA from liver and quadriceps muscles was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' protocol. For epididymal adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue, RNA was extracted with Qiazol and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed as previously described, using 1 μg of total RNA in each cDNA synthesis reaction (14Lau P. Nixon S.J. Parton R.G. Muscat G.E. J. Biol.

The -fold activation is expressed relative to LUC activity obtained after cotransfection of the empty reporter and pSG5 vector only, arbitrarily set at 1. The mean -fold activation values and standard error were derived from three independent experiments of triplicate wells. Blood and Tissue Analysis—High density lipoprotein cholesterol from whole blood was measured using the Cholestech LDX System (Hayward, CA). Measurements of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and non-esterified fatty acid in heparinized plasma samples were analyzed by Clinical Pathology Laboratory, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland (St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia). To obtain hepatic triglyceride measurements, liver tissue was saponified by digestion with ethanolic KOH, neutralized, and then assayed using Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed (and significance assigned) using the ratio t test in the GraphPad Prism 4 software, unless otherwise indicated. RORα1 and -4 mRNA Expression Is Substantially Attenuated in the Metabolic Tissues from sg/sg Mice—As discussed, a number of studies have implicated RORα in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. We were particularly interested in exploring this further and examining the effect of functional RORα deficiency on the regulation of critical genes involved in anabolic and catabolic lipid metabolism in the major mass metabolic tissues in sg/sg mice. Initially, we investigated RORα1 and -α4 mRNA expression in the skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue of homozygous sg/sg mice. We demonstrated expression of the mRNAs encoding RORα1 and -α4 was significantly attenuated in the muscle, liver, and adipose tissues of homozygous sg/sg mice (Fig. 1, A and B). This is concordant with previously reported analysis of RORα expression in the cerebellum, liver, and intestine of sg/sg mice (5Matysiak-Scholze U. Nehls M. Genomics. 1997; 43: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Grotzinger T. De Vos P. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 364: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Staggerer (sg/sg) Mice Display an Early Onset (∼20%) Decrease in Weight That Is Maintained after Maturity and Revealed Reduced Adiposity—Interestingly, as discussed in a very recent report (24Qiu C.H. Shimokawa N. Iwasaki T. Parhar I.S. Koibuchi N. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), no detailed data (over many weeks) on the specific changes in body weight in sg/sg mice have been reported (relative to wild-type littermates), despite hyperphagia on a regular chow diet (16Guastavino J.M. Bertin R. Portet R. Physiol. Behav. 1991; 49: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Crucially, our mice were fed a “pasty mix” of crushed food moistened with water and placed on the floor of the cage. Water is supplied in a small dish, and accessible gel packs are provided in each cage. This circumvents any issues associated with access to food due to stretching difficulties in sg/sg mice that effects mortality (17Guastavino J.M. C. R. Acad. Sci. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. D. 1978; 286: 137-139PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we ascertained the growth pattern of male sg/sg mice from age 4 weeks to maturity at 14 weeks on a normal chow diet. At weaning, the sg/sg mice are ∼50% smaller than their wt counterparts. As they mature the size difference lessens, and by adulthood male sg/sg mice maintain a body mass that is ∼15-20% decreased relative to wt mice (Figs. 2, A and B). The sg/sg mice displayed reduced adiposity (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the size of the epididymal white adipose depots (corrected for total body weight) were markedly and significantly decreased in sg/sg mice (Fig. 2D). This correlated with a substantial reduction in adipocyte cell size (Fig. 2E). No significant differences were observed in the heart, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius skeletal muscle tissues, however, a small, but significant decrease in liver weight was observed (Fig. 2D). Decreased Plasma Cholesterol Is Associated with Decreased Expression of mRNAs Encoding the Reverse Cholesterol Transporters ABCA and ABCA8/G1 in the Liver—Mamontova et al. (11Mamontova A. Seguret-Mace S. Esposito B. Chaniale C. Bouly M. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Luc G. Staels B. Duverger N. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2738-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) previously reported decreased serum cholesterol in sg/sg mice that is associated with decreased apoA1 expression in the intestine (not the liver). We similarly observed plasma (total and HDL) cholesterol were decreased in the serum of sg/sg mice on a normal chow diet (Fig. 3, A and B). We utilized candidate-based expression profiling of the liver, and examined several additional genes (and pathways) that could potentially account for reduced plasma cholesterol. We identified significantly reduced expression of the mRNAs encoding the reverse cholesterol transporters, ABCA1, and ABCA8/G1 in the liver of sg/sg mice (Fig. 3, C and D). Many studies have reported the link between impaired hepatic reverse cholesterol transport and HDL cholesterol. Decreased Serum and Liver Triglycerides in sg/sg Mice Are Mediated by Decreased SREBP-1c and FAS mRNA Expression in the Liver—Raspe et al. (13Raspe E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fievet C. Fruchart J.C. Besnard S. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) demonstrated reduced plasma triglycerides in female sg/sg mice that was associated with reduced apoCIII expression in the liver. Analysis of male sg/sg mice revealed that triglycerides (and non-esterified fatty acids) were decreased (Fig. 4, A and B). Additionally, we examined the total triglyceride content and concentration of the liver. We report that total triglyceride content and the concentration (milligrams/g liver wet weight) are significantly reduced in the hepatic tissue from sg/sg mice, relative to wild-type littermates (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with decreased plasma triglycerides. Subsequently, we utilized candidate-based profiling and examined several genes involved in lipogenesis to identify the underlying changes in gene expression responsible for the dyslipidemia. SREBP-1c is an important hierarchical regulator of lipogenesis (25Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar, 26Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Changes in SREBP-1c (and target gene expression) in liver, adipose, and muscle are associated with changes in plasma triglycerides (25Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar, 27Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed significantly reduced expression of the mRNA encoding SREBP-1c (Fig. 4D) and the lipogenic enzyme, FAS (Fig. 4E) in the liver, and/or skeletal muscle of sg/sg mice, relative to the littermate wt controls. This is concordant with the observed (and reported) reduction in plasma triglycerides from sg/sg mice (13Raspe E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fievet C. Fruchart J.C. Besnard S. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this context, as discussed above, we also observed reduced expression of the mRNA encoding ABCG1 in the liver of sg/sg mice (Fig. 3D), that is also consistent with reduced serum triglycerides and adiposity in the sg/sg mice. A very recent report (28Buchmann J. Meyer C. Neschen S. Augustin R. Schmolz K. Kluge R. Al-Hasani H. Jurgens H. Eulenberg K. Wehr R. Dohrmann C. Joost H.G. Schurmann A. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1561-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), on the ablation of ABCG1 in mice, identified an unexpected role in adiposity and triglyceride storage. Furthermore, in the context of decreased SREBP-1c expression and downstream target genes, we examined the expression of the mRNA encoding glucokinase in fasted liver and observed significantly reduced expression of GcK mRNA expression in sg/sg mice (Fig. 4F). In summary, decreased SREBP-1c and FAS mRNA expression observed in sg/sg mice account for the decreased serum (and liver) triglycerides and reduced adiposity. RORα Regulates the SREBP-1c Promoter—Liver X receptors (LXRs) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) (29Cha J.Y. Repa J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 743-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 30da Silva Xavier G. Rutter G.A. Diraison F. Andreolas C. Leclerc I. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2482-2491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) are critical transcriptional regulators of SREBP-1c, lipogenic gene expression, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Hence, we investigated the expression of LXR (LXRα and LXRβ) and ChREBP in sg/sg mice. We did not detect major changes in the expression of these transcription factors, in the hepatic tissue of sg/sg, relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 4, G-I). The change in LXRβ attained significance, however, the decrease in expression was very small. This suggested that the lower triglyceride levels in the liver and plasma were primarily the result of decreased SREBP-1c expression. SREBP-1c expression is also regulated by insulin, repressed upon fasting, and tightly linked to the nutritional state (31Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B.

In this context, we have observed in the fed versus (6 h) fasted transition that SREBP-1c mRNA expression is very similarly decreased in wt and sg/sg mice (data not shown). This raised the question as to whether dysfunctional RORα expression is responsible for aberrant SREBP-1c expression in sg/sg mice. ChIP analysis (quant"
https://openalex.org/W2057471421,"The Arctic and northern subpolar regions are critical for climate change. Ice-albedo feedback amplifies warming in the Arctic, and fluctuations of regional fresh water inflow to the Arctic Ocean modulate the deep ocean circulation and thus exert a strong global influence. By comparing observations to simulations from 22 coupled climate models, we find influence from anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols in the space-time pattern of precipitation change over high-latitude land areas north of 55 degrees N during the second half of the 20th century. The human-induced Arctic moistening is consistent with observed increases in Arctic river discharge and freshening of Arctic water masses. This result provides new evidence that human activity has contributed to Arctic hydrological change."
https://openalex.org/W2036560723,"In a forward genetic screen for mutations that destabilize the neuromuscular junction, we identified a novel long isoform of Drosophila ankyrin2 (ank2-L). We demonstrate that loss of presynaptic Ank2-L not only causes synapse disassembly and retraction but also disrupts neuronal excitability and NMJ morphology. We provide genetic evidence that ank2-L is necessary to generate the membrane constrictions that normally separate individual synaptic boutons and is necessary to achieve the normal spacing of subsynaptic protein domains, including the normal organization of synaptic cell adhesion molecules. Mechanistically, synapse organization is correlated with a lattice-like organization of Ank2-L, visualized using extended high-resolution structured-illumination microscopy. The stabilizing functions of Ank2-L can be mapped to the extended C-terminal domain that we demonstrate can directly bind and organize synaptic microtubules. We propose that a presynaptic Ank2-L lattice links synaptic membrane proteins and spectrin to the underlying microtubule cytoskeleton to organize and stabilize the presynaptic terminal."

In the particular case of SM, the specific recognition occurs even though SM exposes the same phosphorylcholine headgroup as the other abundant lipid, phosphatidylcholine. SM-binding proteins are currently exploited as specific markers for cellular SM (5Kiyokawa E. Baba T. Otsuka N. Makino A. Ohno S. Kobayashi T. J. Biol.

The two most studied representatives are EqtII, isolated from the sea anemone Actinia equina, and sticholysin II (StII) from Stichodactyla helianthus. Actinoporins constitute a family of conserved proteins that cause hemolysis of red blood cells by colloid-osmotic lysis and exhibit cytolytic activity against various cell lines (7Anderluh G.

Hence actinoporins belong to the class of α-helical pore-forming proteins and represent an important model for the study of protein-membrane interactions (18Anderluh G. Lakey J.H. Tamm L.K.

Interestingly, an equivalent site with similar amino acid residues is used by fungal fruit body lectins to selectively bind a Galβ1–3GalNAc disaccharide (Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen) present on glycoproteins of malignant cells (22Birck C.

Thus the archetypical actinoporin structural scaffold is widespread and is used for the specific binding to various molecules of the plasma membrane (24Gutiérrez-Aguirre I. Trontelj P. Maček P. Lakey J.H. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The membrane-lytic activity of actinoporins is highly SM-dependent (reviewed in Ref. 7Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that SM plays a major role in the binding of the toxin to the membrane (25Bernheimer A.W. Avigad L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This was supported by the recent discovery of a phosphorylcholine (POC) binding site on the surface of StII (15Mancheño J.M. Martín-Benito J. Martínez-Ripoll M. Gavilanes J.G. Hermoso J.A.

However, some published data indicate that the addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes also increases actinoporin permeabilizing activity (26De los Ríos V. Mancheño J.M.

It thus remains to be determined whether the SM effect originates from a general influence of the physico-chemical properties of the membrane or is a result of specific binding. Lipid specificity has been poorly addressed in the available structural studies of actinoporins (13Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D.

Recently, however, it was shown by introducing a 19F label on EqtII tryptophans that Trp112 participates in SM recognition, as it exhibits specific NMR chemical shift changes upon the addition of SM to PC micelles (31Anderluh G. Razpotnik A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Separovic F. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this work we have tested the hypothesis that EqtII can specifically bind sphingomyelin both in solution and in lipid membranes. We show that EqtII is able to specifically bind SM but neither cholesterol nor phosphatidylcholine. We additionally show that the membrane-binding step is driven mainly by hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions and that the residues Trp112 and Tyr113 enable SM dependence. Materials—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dipropionoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, porcine brain SM, N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosylphosphorylcholine (Ac-SM), chicken egg SM, porcine brain ceramide, d-glucosyl-β-1,1′-N-stearoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, d-galactosyl-β-1–1′-N-nervonoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, d-lactosyl-β-1,1′-N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine, ovine brain ganglioside GM1, and cholesterol were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); 1-lauroyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was from Sigma. Bovine brain SM was used in all experiments unless stated otherwise. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Recombinant EqtII, mutants and histidine-tagged variants were prepared in Escherichia coli as described previously (19Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F.

The tryptophan fluorescence and far UV circular dichroism spectra showed that mutations did not cause large structural changes. 9G. Anderluh, unpublished data. EqtII G27C mutant was labeled with N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) as described (16Malovrh P. Viero G. Dalla Serra M. Podlesek Z. Lakey J.H. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22678-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All reported lipid ratios are mol:mol ratios. Liposome Preparations—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of 100-nm diameter were prepared by extrusion of multilamellar vesicles as described previously (19Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla S. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). When using calcein, excess dye was removed by gel filtration through a small G-50 column. Permeabilization assays of calcein-loaded liposomes were conducted with a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorometer in a 1.5-ml cuvette. Liposomes at 25 μm lipid concentration were stirred in 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5 (vesicle buffer), at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set to 485 nm, emission was followed at 520 nm, and both slits were set to 5 nm. Permeabilization was expressed as the percentage of maximal permeabilization obtained at the end of the assay by addition of detergent Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 2 mm. Hemolysis and Preparation of Erythrocyte Ghosts—Hemolysis of human or bovine red blood cells was measured at room temperature by using a microplate reader (MRX, Dynex). Blood was washed several times with 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (erythrocyte buffer), and proteins were diluted 2-fold across the microtiter plate into a final volume of 100 μl of erythrocyte buffer. The same volume of erythrocyte suspension (A630 = 0.5) was added to each well, and hemolysis was monitored at 630 nm for 20 min at room temperature. Erythrocyte ghosts were prepared from washed erythrocytes by lysing 50 μl of erythrocytes with 1400 μl of cold 5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, for 5 min on ice. Lysed erythrocytes were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Ghosts were washed with the same buffer until all hemoglobin was removed, i.e. when a clear pellet was obtained that could subsequently be resuspended in a small volume of buffer. Cholesterol was depleted from erythrocytes by incubation with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min at 37 °C. SM was removed from erythrocytes by incubation with Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase. 0.5 ml of washed erythrocytes was incubated with 2 units/ml B. cereus sphingomyelinase in the presence of 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline in erythrocyte buffer for 60 min at 37 °C. Erythrocytes were washed extensively before use in hemolytic assay or ghost preparations. The removal of cholesterol and SM from erythrocyte membranes was confirmed by enzymatic tests for lipid concentration determination: phospholipids B (for choline-containing lipids) and free cholesterol C (for cholesterol) (both from Wako). Additionally, total lipid extracts were prepared from erythrocytes by the method of Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) to confirm both the removal of SM and cholesterol and that the amount of other lipids in the membrane was not altered. The TLC plates were stained with primulin and visualized under UV light. Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed on a Biacore X (Biacore AB) at 25 °C. An L1 chip was equilibrated with vesicle buffer, and a liposome-coated chip surface was prepared as described previously (34Anderluh G. Beseničar M. Kladnik A. Lakey J.H. Maček P. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 344: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proteins (0.5 μm) were injected over immobilized LUV for 2 min at 5 μl/min, and the dissociation was followed for 4 min. Erythrocyte ghosts were immobilized by using the same protocol to a final value of 1200 response units (RU). The concentration of EqtII was 50 nm for the binding assay employing erythrocyte ghosts. Blank injections were subtracted from sensorgrams to correct for the buffer contribution. The amount of stably inserted protein after 4 min of dissociation was determined from the sensorgrams and used to report in Figs. 3, B and D, and 4D.FIGURE 4Removal of SM protects human erythrocytes against permeabilizing activity of EqtII.

Protein concentrations were adjusted so that the response did not exceed 300 RU. This enabled us to monitor only the initial binding to the liposomes and not the subsequent steps in the pore-forming mechanism (34Anderluh G. Beseničar M. Kladnik A. Lakey J.H. Maček P. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 344: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The data were globally fitted to a two-step binding model described in detail in Hong et al. (21Hong Q. Gutiérrez-Aguirre I. Barlič A. Malovrh P. Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Turk D. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41916-41924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The first and last 10 s of the injection and the first 10 s of the dissociation were not included in the fit because of bulk refractive index changes and mixing effects (35Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Binding of lipid analogues to proteins was performed on a Biacore 2000 (Biacore AB). Wild-type EqtII or mutants were immobilized on the surface of a CM5 chip to ∼4000 RU as recommended by the supplier (Biacore AB). The buffer used was 20 mm NaH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 (SPR buffer), and the flow rate was set to 40 μl/min. Association was followed for 1 min and dissociation for 3 min. Lipid analogues were dissolved as 50 mm stock solutions in SPR buffer. We could only perform a qualitative analysis for the Ac-SM, because it forms micelles at a concentration of 31 μm, 10I. Gutiérrez-Aguirre and G. Anderluh, unpublished data. and hence we could not determine whether it bound as a monomer. Lipid Monolayer Assay—The increase in the surface pressure of lipid monolayers of different compositions was measured with a MicroTrough-S system from Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) at room temperature. The aqueous subphase consisted of 500 μl of 10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Appropriate lipid mixtures, dissolved in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), were gently spread over the subphase to create a monolayer with the desired initial surface pressure. The final protein concentration in the well was 1 μm. The increment in surface pressure versus time was monitored until a stable signal was obtained. Dot-blot Assay—Lipids were spotted on a charge-modified nylon membrane (Sigma) from a 100 pmol/μl stock solution in chloroform:methanol 4:0.1 (v/v). Sphingo Array, a commercial membrane spotted with lipids as specified by the producer (Product No. S-600C, Echelon), was also used. Membranes were first blocked for 4 h in 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Histidine-tagged protein at final 2.5 μg/ml concentration was then added, and the membrane was incubated overnight at room temperature on a rotary shaker. Membranes were washed three times (each time for 10 min) in 1% BSA. They were then incubated with mouse anti-polyhistidine antibodies in 1% BSA for 2 h, washed with 1% BSA as described above, incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and finally washed with 1% BSA as above. The dot-blot was developed by using 4-chloro-1-naphthol as a substrate. ThermoFluor Assay—To test the thermal stability of the EqtII fold in the presence and absence of lipid analogues we used the ThermoFluor approach (36Meier C. Aricescu A.R. Assenberg R. Aplin R.T. Gilbert R.J. Grimes J.M. Stuart D.I. Structure (Camb.). 2006; 14: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Temperature scans from 4–100 °C were performed with 5 μg of EqtII alone and in the presence of phosphocholine (concentrations up to 1 mm) and acetyl-SM (concentrations up to 28 μm) while monitoring the fluorescence of the dye SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes). The fluorescence of SYPRO Orange increases upon unfolding of the protein, and hence reports on changes in protein fold and stability are made possible. Molecular Modeling and Calculation of the Electrostatic Properties—The structure of cytolysin from Sagartia rosea was modeled using SWISS-MODEL (37Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar). The electrostatic properties were calculated and visualized with GRASP as described previously (38Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). Structural figures were prepared with PyMol (39DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). EqtII Directly Binds SM or SM Analogue but Not Other Lipids—We first examined whether EqtII employs SM or other lipids as a membrane receptor. We first performed a lipid dot-blot assay with a range of sphingolipids and some other lipids that were used in this study (Fig. 1A). EqtII recognized only two different sphingomyelins, i.e. from bovine brain and chicken egg (Fig. 1A). These two differ in the properties of the fatty acid acyl chain but possess the same headgroup. EqtII bound to SM in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). EqtII did not bind to any other lipid tested, most notably cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and any of the other sphingolipids used, i.e. ceramide, glucosylceramide, galactosylceramide, and monosialoganglioside GM1 (Fig. 1, A and B). It also did not bind other sphingolipids and glycerol-based phospholipids not presented in Fig. 1, A and B, i.e. sphingosine, disialoganglioside (GD3), 3-sulfogalactosylceramide, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and some of its phosphorylated variants, lysophosphocholine, and lysophosphatidic acid. SPR analysis of chip-immobilized EqtII showed that the toxin could not bind phosphocholine, the headgroup of PC and SM, or other PC analogues, i.e. dipropionoylphosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine. However, it bound the water-soluble, short-chain SM analogue Ac-SM at μm concentrations (Fig. 1C). In summary, Fig. 1 shows that EqtII has the ability to directly and specifically bind to SM and the available water-soluble SM analogue, Ac-SM, in solution. The interaction of EqtII with phosphocholine and Ac-SM was also assessed with a thermal stability assay. Fig. 2A shows the fluorescence thermograms for EqtII alone and in the presence of phosphocholine and Ac-SM. As evident from the superposed thermal scans, phosphocholine does not influence the melting behavior of EqtII (peak at 76.0 °C for the EqtII alone and at 76.1 for EqtII in the presence of phosphocholine). However, Ac-SM changes the stability profile of EqtII markedly. In addition to the main transition, which shifts to a slightly lower temperature (peak at 73.8 °C), a pretransition peak can be observed (peak at 67.6 °C, arrow in Fig. 2A). The stability and hence the compactness of the EqtII structure is clearly reduced in the presence of Ac-SM compared with controls. Notably, the bimodal melting profile is indicative of a conformational change of EqtII upon Ac-SM binding, which phosphocholine alone is not able to induce. We further checked whether the presence of Ac-SM is able to inhibit EqtII-induced hemolysis of erythrocytes. Ac-SM was inhibitory at μm concentration, whereas neither dipropionoylphosphatidylcholine nor phosphocholine was inhibitory at mm concentrations (Fig. 2B). All of these data clearly show that EqtII can directly and specifically bind SM or its analogues but not PC, PC analogues, or cholesterol. Some previous studies have used many different lipids to assess the interaction with EqtII or sticholysin by measuring the inhibition of permeabilizing activity. Among lipids used in our binding assays, these studies also employed some other sphingolipids such as cerebrosides (25Bernheimer A.W. Avigad L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 40Maček P. Structural and Functional Properties of Equinatoxins. University of Ljubljana, 1983Google Scholar, 41Zecchini M. Struttura e Funzione du una Citolisina Basica Estratta dalle Nematocisti dell'Anemone di Mare Actina equina. Universita di Padova, 1994Google Scholar). They showed that only SM was able to considerably inhibit permeabilizing activity. Thus our direct binding studies are in excellent agreement with previous inhibitory tests. Next we examined the role of SM in the binding of EqtII to liposomes. We tested the binding of EqtII to membranes using SPR by immobilizing liposomes of different composition on an L1 sensor chip. The binding of EqtII was negligible for DOPC and DOPC:cholesterol (3:2) liposomes but high and stable when liposomes composed of DOPC:SM (1:1) were used (Fig. 3A). These differences in binding might arise from SM-induced changes in the bilayer physical properties, i.e. changes in membrane bilayer fluidity, as SM has very different physical properties than DOPC. Hence we replaced SM with DPPC, a PC with disaturated acyl chains and physical properties similar to those of SM and the ability to induce lipid domain formation in binary and ternary mixtures (42Kahya N. Scherfeld D."
https://openalex.org/W2033270597,"Left ventricular mass (LVM) and cardiac gene expression are complex traits regulated by factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to the heart. To dissect the major determinants of LVM, we combined expression quantitative trait locus1 and quantitative trait transcript2 (QTT) analyses of the cardiac transcriptome in the rat. Using these methods and in vitro functional assays, we identified osteoglycin (Ogn) as a major candidate regulator of rat LVM, with increased Ogn protein expression associated with elevated LVM. We also applied genome-wide QTT analysis to the human heart and observed that, out of ∼22,000 transcripts, OGN transcript abundance had the highest correlation with LVM. We further confirmed a role for Ogn in the in vivo regulation of LVM in Ogn knockout mice. Taken together, these data implicate Ogn as a key regulator of LVM in rats, mice and humans, and suggest that Ogn modifies the hypertrophic response to extrinsic factors such as hypertension and aortic stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2042099250,"The modifications occurring in the brain during learning and memory are still poorly understood but may involve long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission (synaptic plasticity). In perirhinal cortex, a lasting decrement in neuronal responsiveness is associated with visual familiarity discrimination, leading to the hypothesis that long-term depression (LTD)-like synaptic plasticity may underlie recognition memory. LTD relies on internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) through interaction between their GluR2 subunits and AP2, the clathrin adaptor protein required for endocytosis. We demonstrate that a peptide that blocks interactions between GluR2 and AP2 blocks LTD in perirhinal cortex in vitro. Viral transduction of this peptide in perirhinal cortex produced striking deficits in visual recognition memory. Furthermore, there was a deficit of LTD in perirhinal cortex slices from virally transduced, recognition memory-deficient animals. These results suggest that internalization of AMPA receptors, a process critical for the expression of LTD in perirhinal cortex, underlies visual recognition memory.

Learning is widely believed to depend on the same mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) (Abraham and Robins, 2005Abraham W.C.

Indeed, various lines of evidence have shown that under certain circumstances it is possible to produce a correlation between learning and memory and LTP-like increases in synaptic strength (Maren, 2005Maren S.

More recently, LTD-like processes have been suggested to be equally effective at storing information that is essential for learning and memory (Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2007Kemp A.

For example, correlations exist between spatial exploration and both depotentiation and LTD (Abraham et al., 2002Abraham W.C. Logan B. Greenwood J.M. Dragunow M.

However, despite these long-standing associations there is still surprisingly little direct evidence that the mechanisms responsible for either LTP or LTD are responsible for learning and memory. In this study, we chose to examine whether a link between LTD and learning and memory could be established. In order to achieve this, we examined visual recognition memory. The familiarity discrimination component of visual recognition memory requires perirhinal cortex: ablation of perirhinal cortex results in deficits in such memory (Brown and Aggleton, 2001Brown M.W.

One approach taken to investigate whether mechanisms of synaptic plasticity underlie learning has been to block membrane receptors, or biochemical cascades downstream of receptor activation, that are known to be involved in the induction of synaptic plasticity and to examine whether such manipulations prevent learning and memory (Conquet et al., 1994Conquet F.

However, impairment of learning and memory in such experiments could occur through a myriad of different nonspecific effects rather than through effects directly on the plasticity mechanism underlying the particular learning (Cain and Saucier, 1996Cain D.P.

In order to circumvent the problems associated with the above type of approach, we sought a more direct means of seeking a link between synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. In order to achieve this, we examined specifically the link between LTD and memory. The expression of NMDAR-dependent LTD relies on the internalization of postsynaptic AMPARs through a dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated process (Beattie et al., 2000Beattie E.C. Carroll R.C. Yu X.

Expression of cerebellar long-term depression requires postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been shown that AP2, a clathrin adaptor protein, is important for the internalization of surface AMPARs and for the expression of NMDAR-dependent LTD (Lee et al., 2002Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M.

The critical step involves an interaction between AP2 and the GluR2 subunit of AMPARs. Preventing this critical step in the expression of synaptic plasticity provides a more direct means of investigating the link between plasticity and learning than has previously been achieved. In this study, we used the peptide pepΔA849-Q853 (Lee et al., 2002Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Clathrin adaptor AP2 and NSF interact with overlapping sites of GluR2 and play distinct roles in AMPA receptor trafficking and hippocampal LTD.Neuron. 2002; 36: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) to prevent the interaction between AP2 and GluR2. We report that it prevented LTD in perirhinal cortex neurons in vitro. Moreover, stereotaxic injections to transduce perirhinal cortex in vivo with lentiviral vectors expressing pepΔA849-Q853 resulted in a deficit in perirhinal cortex-dependent learning. Furthermore, there was a deficit in LTD in perirhinal cortex slices from pepΔA849-Q853 transduced animals. These data provide evidence that perirhinal cortex-dependent learning and memory is dependent on LTD expression mechanisms. We recorded from single neurons in perirhinal cortex slices using whole-cell recording in vitro. Robust LTD (to 46% ± 6% of baseline, n = 9, p < 0.001; Figure 1A) was induced by pairing depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron to −40 mV with conditioning stimulation (200 stimuli at 1 Hz). This form of LTD was homosynaptic; no depression was observed in the nonconditioned input (96% ± 7%, n = 9, p > 0.05; Figure 1A). Furthermore, the induction of LTD was NMDAR dependent, being blocked by the selective NMDAR antagonist D-AP5 (96% ± 7%, n = 7; p > 0.05; Figure 1B). The effect of conditioning stimulation in the presence of D-AP5 was significantly different to that in the absence of D-AP5 (t(14) = 6.92, p < 0.001). Further experiments were performed in which the whole-cell filling solution contained the peptide pepΔA849-Q853 to prevent the interaction between GluR2 and AP2 (Lee et al., 2002Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M.

In perirhinal cortex neurons, pepΔA849-Q853 had no effect on baseline AMPAR-mediated transmission (112% ± 8%, n = 6, p > 0.05; Figure 1C), and there was no difference (t(10) = 1.91, p > 0.1) between cells in which pepΔA849-Q853 was present compared to cells recorded in the absence of the peptide (104% ± 7%, n = 6; Figure 1C). The addition of pepΔA849-Q853 had no effect on GABAAR- or NMDAR-mediated transmission (108% ± 4%, n = 3, p > 0.05; 106% ± 3%, n = 3, p > 0.05, respectively; Figure 1D). There was no significant difference between experiments including pepΔA849-Q853 and interleaved controls lacking pepΔA849-Q853 for either GABAAR- or NMDAR-mediated transmission: GABAA (t(4) = 0.24, p > 0.5); NMDA (t(4) = 0.21, p > 0.5). The induction of LTD was completely blocked in experiments in which pepΔA849-Q853 was included in the filling solution (99% ± 6%, n = 7, p > 0.05; Figure 1E) but was induced in interleaved experiments in which pepΔA849-Q853 was not included in the filling solution (47% ± 6%, n = 7, p < 0.005; data not shown). In addition, we performed experiments with the control peptide pep-K844A, which does not block GluR2-AP2 interaction (Lee et al., 2002Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Clathrin adaptor AP2 and NSF interact with overlapping sites of GluR2 and play distinct roles in AMPA receptor trafficking and hippocampal LTD.Neuron. 2002; 36: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Inclusion of this peptide in the whole-cell solution had no effect on basal transmission (data not shown) and had no affect on the induction of LTD (50% ± 13%, n = 6, p > 0.05; Figure 1F). The effect of LTD inducing stimulation was significantly different in the presence of pepΔA849-Q853 compared to interleaved controls (t(12) = 9.64, p < 0.001) or in the presence of pep-K844A (t(11) = 4.88, p < 0.001). These results provide evidence that preventing GluR2-AP2 interaction blocks activity-dependent LTD in perirhinal cortex without effects on normal glutamatergic excitatory or GABAergic inhibitory transmission. To examine whether activity-dependent LTD plays a role in visual recognition memory, we used bilateral stereotaxic injections in vivo to transduce perirhinal cortex with lentiviral vectors expressing either pepΔA849-Q853-IRES-EGFP, the control peptide pep-K844A-IRES-EGFP, or lentivirus expressing EGFP alone. Fourteen days after lentivirus injection, animals were tested in different memory tasks. First, we measured perirhinal cortex-dependent familiarity discrimination by an object recognition memory test that measures a rat's spontaneous preference of a novel compared to a familiar object (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988Ennaceur A. Delacour J. A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats. 1: Behavioral data.Behav. Brain Res. 1988; 31: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). As a control, we measured hippocampally dependent spatial memory by an object-in-place task in which the spatial positions of objects are interchanged to produce a new spatial configuration (Dix and Aggleton, 1999Dix S.L. Aggleton J.P. Extending the spontaneous preference test of recognition: evidence of object-location and object-context recognition.Behav. Brain Res. 1999; 99: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The experimenter was blind concerning whether animals were pepΔA849-Q853-transduced, pep-K844A-transduced, or lentivirus controls. Object recognition memory was unaffected by lentiviral-EGFP transduction into perirhinal cortex: the animals spent significantly more time exploring novel compared to familiar objects following a postacquisition delay of either 5 min or 24 hr (discrimination ratio significantly greater than zero, for 5 min test: D2 = 0.41 ± 0.04, n = 8, p < 0.001; for 24 hr test: D2 = 0.37 ± 0.06, n = 8; p < 0.05; Figure 2A). Furthermore, object recognition memory was unaffected by lentiviral transduction of the control peptide pep-K844A into perirhinal cortex: the animals spent significantly more time exploring novel compared to familiar objects following a postacquisition delay of either 5 min or 24 hr (for 5 min test: D2 = 0.4 ± 0.07, n = 8; p < 0.001; for 24 hr test: D2 = 0.36 ± 0.06, n = 8; p < 0.001). In marked contrast, however, object recognition memory was disrupted in lentiviral-pepΔA849-Q853-transduced animals: these animals were unable to differentiate between novel and familiar objects following either a 5 min or a 24 hr delay (for 5 min test: D2 = −0.10 ± 0.12, n = 8, p > 0.4; for 24 hr test: D2 = −0.10 ± 0.04, n = 8; p > 0.06; Figure 2A). Thus, there was a significant main effect of treatment at 5 min (F(21) = 29.45, p < 0.001) and 24 hr (F(21) = 22.17, p < 0.01). There were no differences between the pepΔA849-Q853-transduced animals, pep-K844A-transduced animals, and control animals with respect to total exploration (data not shown), indicating that pep-K844A and pepΔA849-Q853-transduction had no untoward effects on other behavioral factors, such as perception, motivation, and motor function, important for completing the learning task. The lentivirus control, pep-K844A, and pepΔA849-Q853 animals were all able to perform the object-in-place memory task (EGFP control group: D2 = 0.38 ± 0.03, n = 8, p < 0.001; pep-K844A: D2 = 0.39 ± 0.03, n = 8, p < 0.001; pepΔA849-Q853: D2 = 0.41 ± 0.05, n = 8, p < 0.001; Figure 2B) with there being no difference in performance between the groups (F(21) = 0.41, p > 0.7). The extent of spread of lentivirus in perirhinal cortex was assessed by examining EGFP fluorescence in a subset of animals (Figure 2C). Three animals from each group were anesthetized with euthetal and perfused transcardially with PFA. Following appropriate preparation (see Experimental Procedures), EGFP expression was monitored using fluorescent microscopy. The maximum anterior-posterior spread was ∼1.8 mm, dorsal-ventral spread ∼1.4 mm, and the medial-lateral spread ∼1.1 mm. Thus, a large portion of the perirhinal cortex was transduced by the lentiviral technique (Figure 2C). The extent of neuronal transfection (60% ± 2%, Figure 2D) was assessed by calculating the fraction of NeuN-stained cells that were colabeled with EGFP. These neurons occurred in layers II/III and V/VI of perirhinal cortex in an area that included the whole of the region that encompassed the in vitro electrophysiological recording and stimulating sites. These results show that disruption of GluR2-AP2 interaction in perirhinal cortex prevents visual recognition memory. Our results strongly indicate that the disruption of the memory process was due to the specific effects of pepΔA849-Q853 blocking AMPAR internalization and not a nonspecific effect of viral transduction. Furthermore, transduction into perirhinal cortex resulted in a selective deficit of object recognition memory with no effect on a hippocampally dependent spatial memory task. The selectiveness of the effect on nonspatial but not on spatial learning provides an important additional control for the effects of the transduction. Next, we carried out experiments to examine whether there were any effects on LTD of the in vivo pepΔA849-Q853-transduction of perirhinal cortex. First, we performed a series of control experiments in perirhinal slices from naive animals. In these slices, we confirmed, using extracellular field recordings, that NMDAR-dependent LTD was induced by 5 Hz stimulation (In D-AP5: 98% ± 3%, n = 5, p > 0.6. After washout of D-AP5: 77% ± 7%, n = 5, p < 0.01; significant difference between D-AP5 and wash, t(4) = 5.65, p < 0.001; Figure 3A). The same recording and stimulation protocols were then used in perirhinal cortex slices taken from the different transduced animals, which had performed the object recognition and object-in-place tasks. The experimenter was blind concerning the animals from which the perirhinal cortex slices originated. There were no differences (F(12) = 0.69, p > 0.5) in the magnitude of basal synaptic transmission between slices from pepΔA849-Q853-transduced, pep-K844A, or naive animals, and there was no difference in the input/output curves between naive, pep-K844A, and pepΔA849-Q853-transduced animals (F(12) = 0.09, p > 0.9; Figure 3B). These results suggest that there were no adverse effects of lentiviral transduction of the different peptides on neuronal viability and, furthermore, that network excitability was also not adversely affected following lentiviral transduction. In slices taken from EGFP control animals, homosynaptic LTD was induced on each occasion tested (73% ± 7%, n = 5, p < 0.01; Figure 3C). Furthermore, in slices from pep-K844A animals, homosynaptic LTD was also induced on each occasion (81% ± 4%, n = 5, p < 0.001; Figure 3D); the magnitude of LTD was not different (F(12) = 0.53, p > 0.6) between naive, EGFP control, or pep-K844A animals. However, in slices taken from pepΔA849-Q853-transduced animals, LTD was not induced on any occasion tested (104% ± 3%, n = 5, p > 0.6; Figure 3E). There was a significant main effect of treatment on LTD inducing stimulation (F(12) = 6.86, p < 0.01). In contrast to the deficit in LTD, LTP was induced in slices from pepΔA849-Q853 transduced animals (114% ± 2%, n = 5, p < 0.05; Figure 3F), in slices from EGFP control animals (123% ± 6%, n = 5, p < 0.05; Figure 3F), and in slices from pepK844A animals (130% ± 4%, n = 5, p < 0.01; Figure 3F). There was no significant effect of treatment on the magnitude of LTP (F(12) = 2.65, p > 0.1). Together, these results suggest that LTD, but not LTP, is blocked by pepΔA849-Q853 transduction and that LTD mechanisms are likely to play a critical role in visual recognition memory. There is accumulating evidence that mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are involved in experience-dependent changes in the developing cortex (Bear, 2003Bear M.F.

This study demonstrates that LTD expression mechanisms in perirhinal cortex play a critical role in visual recognition memory. Previous work demonstrated that AP2 plays a key role in the expression of hippocampal activity-dependent LTD (Lee et al., 2002Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M.

https://openalex.org/W2046356130,"Integrins play a role in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling through cross-talk with FGF receptors (FGFRs), but the mechanism underlying the cross-talk is unknown. We discovered that FGF1 directly bound to soluble and cell-surface integrin alphavbeta3 (K(D) about 1 microm). Antagonists to alphavbeta3 (monoclonal antibody 7E3 and cyclic RGDfV) blocked this interaction. alphavbeta3 was the predominant, if not the only, integrin that bound to FGF1, because FGF1 bound only weakly to several beta1 integrins tested. We presented evidence that the CYDMKTTC sequence (the specificity loop) within the ligand-binding site of beta3 plays a role in FGF1 binding. We found that the integrin-binding site of FGF1 overlaps with the heparin-binding site but is distinct from the FGFR-binding site using docking simulation and mutagenesis. We identified an FGF1 mutant (R50E) that was defective in integrin binding but still bound to heparin and FGFR. R50E was defective in inducing DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, cell migration, and chemotaxis, suggesting that the direct integrin binding to FGF1 is critical for FGF signaling. Nevertheless, R50E induced phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2alpha and activation of AKT and ERK1/2. These results suggest that the defect in R50E in FGF signaling is not in the initial activation of FGF signaling pathway components, but in the later steps in FGF signaling. We propose that R50E is a useful tool to identify the role of integrins in FGF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2035801011,"Synaptic connections are stabilized through transsynaptic adhesion complexes that are anchored in the underlying cytoskeleton. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJs) serves as a model system to unravel genes required for the structural remodeling of synapses. In a mutagenesis screen for regulators of synaptic stability, we recovered mutations in Drosophila ankyrin 2 (ank2) affecting two giant Ank2 isoforms that are specifically expressed in the nervous system and associate with the presynaptic membrane cytoskeleton. ank2 mutant larvae show severe deficits in the stability of NMJs, resulting in a reduction in overall terminal size, withdrawal of synaptic boutons, and disassembly of presynaptic active zones. In addition, lack of Ank2 leads to disintegration of the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins fail to extend into distant boutons. Interestingly, Ank2 functions downstream of spectrin in the anchorage of synaptic microtubules, providing the cytoskeletal scaffold that is essential for synaptic stability."
https://openalex.org/W1999669021,"Invasive tumors, including gliomas, utilize proteinases to degrade extracellular matrix components and diffuse into the adjacent tissues or migrate toward distant ones. In addition, proteinase activity is required for the formation of new blood vessels within the tumor. Levels of the proteinase matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) are highly increased in gliomas. In this study, we examined the effect of the downregulation of MMP-2 via adenovirus-mediated siRNA in gliomas. Here, we show that siRNA delivery significantly decreased levels of MMP-2 in the glioblastoma cell lines U-87 and U-251. U-87 and U-251 cells showed impaired invasion through matrigel as well as decreased migration from tumor spheroids transfected with adenoviral vector expressing siRNA against MMP-2. Additionally, tumor-induced angiogenesis was decreased in in vitro experiments in cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) in serum-free conditioned medium of glioblastoma cells transfected with these constructs and co-cultures of glioma cells with HMECs. We also observed decreased angiogenesis in the in vivo dorsal skin-fold chamber model. Moreover, MMP-2 inhibition induced apoptotic cell death in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth of preestablished U-251 intracranial xenografts in nude mice. Thus, specific targeting of MMP-2 may provide a novel, efficient approach for the treatment of gliomas and improve the poor outcomes of patients with these brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2168545629,"Abnormal serotonin-glutamate interaction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in the pathophysiology of many mental disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. However, the mechanisms by which this interaction occurs remain unclear. Our previous study has shown that activation of 5-HT1A receptors inhibits N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) currents in PFC pyramidal neurons by disrupting microtubule-based transport of NMDARs. Here we found that activation of 5-HT2A/C receptors significantly attenuated the effect of 5-HT1A on NMDAR currents and microtubule depolymerization. The counteractive effect of 5-HT2A/C on 5-HT1A regulation of synaptic NMDAR response was also observed in PFC pyramidal neurons from intact animals treated with various 5-HT-related drugs. Moreover, 5-HT2A/C stimulation triggered the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in dendritic processes. Inhibition of the β-arrestin/Src/dynamin signaling blocked 5-HT2A/C activation of ERK and the counteractive effect of 5-HT2A/C on 5-HT1A regulation of NMDAR currents. Immunocytochemical studies showed that 5-HT2A/C treatment blocked the inhibitory effect of 5-HT1A on surface NR2B clusters on dendrites, which was prevented by cellular knockdown of β-arrestins. Taken together, our study suggests that serotonin, via 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptor activation, regulates NMDAR functions in PFC neurons in a counteractive manner. 5-HT2A/C, by activating ERK via the β-arrestin-dependent pathway, opposes the 5-HT1A disruption of microtubule stability and NMDAR transport. These findings provide a framework for understanding the complex interactions between serotonin and NMDARs in PFC, which could be important for cognitive and emotional control in which both systems are highly involved. Abnormal serotonin-glutamate interaction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in the pathophysiology of many mental disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. However, the mechanisms by which this interaction occurs remain unclear. Our previous study has shown that activation of 5-HT1A receptors inhibits N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) currents in PFC pyramidal neurons by disrupting microtubule-based transport of NMDARs. Here we found that activation of 5-HT2A/C receptors significantly attenuated the effect of 5-HT1A on NMDAR currents and microtubule depolymerization. The counteractive effect of 5-HT2A/C on 5-HT1A regulation of synaptic NMDAR response was also observed in PFC pyramidal neurons from intact animals treated with various 5-HT-related drugs. Moreover, 5-HT2A/C stimulation triggered the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in dendritic processes. Inhibition of the β-arrestin/Src/dynamin signaling blocked 5-HT2A/C activation of ERK and the counteractive effect of 5-HT2A/C on 5-HT1A regulation of NMDAR currents. Immunocytochemical studies showed that 5-HT2A/C treatment blocked the inhibitory effect of 5-HT1A on surface NR2B clusters on dendrites, which was prevented by cellular knockdown of β-arrestins. Taken together, our study suggests that serotonin, via 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptor activation, regulates NMDAR functions in PFC neurons in a counteractive manner. 5-HT2A/C, by activating ERK via the β-arrestin-dependent pathway, opposes the 5-HT1A disruption of microtubule stability and NMDAR transport. These findings provide a framework for understanding the complex interactions between serotonin and NMDARs in PFC, which could be important for cognitive and emotional control in which both systems are highly involved.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic functions of serotonin are afforded by the concerted actions of multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes, 5-HT1- to 5-HT7 (2Andrade R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Bajwa P. Parsons L.H. Tecott L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15049-15054Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). One of the major targets of serotonin is prefrontal cortex (PFC), a crucial brain region controlling emotion and cognition (7Goldman-Rakic P.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 8Miller E.K. Neuron. 1999; 22: 15-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have shown that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, which are abundantly co-expressed in most of PFC pyramidal neurons (9Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), often have opposing actions on common substrates. For instance, activation of 5-HT1A receptors results in neuronal inhibition by increasing potassium currents (10Araneda R. Andrade R. Neuroscience. 1991; 40: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and decreasing calcium currents (11Penington N.J. Kelly J.S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 751-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, 5-HT2A receptor stimulation leads to neuronal excitation by suppressing potassium currents (2Andrade R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 190-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and enhancing pre-synaptic glutamate release (12Aghajanian G.K. Marek G.J. Brain Res. 1999; 825: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevated 5-HT1A receptors and reduced 5-HT2A receptors are found in PFC of schizophrenia patients (13Schreiber R. De Vry J. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1993; 17: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Burnet P.W. Eastwood S.L. Harrison P.J. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1996; 15: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), suggesting that the levels of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors are differentially altered in diseased states. One of the potential cellular targets of 5-HT receptors involved in cognitive and emotional control is the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mental disorders (15Tsai G. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). NMDAR hypofunction caused by systemic administration of non-competitive NMDAR antagonists or knockdown of NMDAR expression produces schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms (16Javitt D.C. Zukin S.R. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1991; 148: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar, 17Jentsch J.D. Roth R.H.

Cell. 1999; 98: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been found that the expression of NMDARs is reduced in postmortem brains of depressed patients (19Law A.J. Deakin J.F. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2971-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and chronic antidepressant treatment enhances NMDAR levels in mouse brains (20Boyer P.A. Skolnick P. Fossom L.H. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our previous study has shown that activation of 5-HT1A receptors suppresses NMDAR channel function in PFC pyramidal neurons (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether 5-HT2A receptor activation has any impact on the 5-HT1A-NMDAR interaction. Here we show that activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors in PFC pyramidal neurons regulates NMDAR channels in a counteractive manner by converging on the microtubule-based transport of NMDARs that is regulated by ERK. Given the importance of NMDAR and serotonin in mental processes under normal and pathological conditions, the complex regulation of NMDAR function by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors may provide a molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the role of serotonin in regulating cognitive and emotional behaviors. Whole Cell Recordings—Whole cell current recordings of cultured PFC neurons employed standard voltage-clamp techniques as those we described previously (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29420-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The external solution for recording NMDAR-mediated current contained (in mm): 127 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 BaCl2, 12 glucose, 0.001 tetrodotoxin, and glycine 0.02, pH 7.3–7.4, 300–305 mosm/liter. The internal solution contained (in mm): 180 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4 MgCl2, 40 HEPES, 0.5 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 12 phosphocreatine, 3 Na2ATP, and 0.5 Na2GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH 7.2-3, 265–270 mosm/liter. Recordings were obtained with an Axon Instruments (Union City, CA) 200B patch clamp amplifier that was monitored by an IBM PC running pClamp 8 with a DigiData 1320 series interface. Electrode resistances were normally 2–4 MΩ in bath solution. Following seal rupture, series resistance (4–10 MΩ) was compensated (70–90%). Attention was applied to monitor the series resistance, and recordings were stopped when a significant increase (>20%) occurred. The whole cell NMDAR-mediated current was evoked by NMDA (100 μm) application for 2 s every 30 s with neurons held at –60 mV. Drugs were applied with a “sewer pipe” system. The array of drug capillaries was positioned a few hundred micrometers from the cell under recording. Solution changes were controlled by the SF-77B fast-step solution stimulus delivery device (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Data were analyzed with AxoGraph (Axon instruments) and KaleidaGraph (Albeck Software). ANOVA was performed to compare the differential degrees of current regulation between experimental groups subjected to different drug treatment. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Electrophysiological Recordings in Slices—To record NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, we performed the standard whole cell recording techniques in layer V PFC pyramidal neurons (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Zhong P. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9852-9861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patch pipettes (5–9 MΩ) were filled with the following internal solution (in mm): 130 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2.2 QX-314, 12 phosphocreatine, 5 MgATP, 0.5 Na2GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mosm/liter. PFC slices (300 μm) were perfused at room temperature (22–24 °C), with artificial cerebrospinal fluid was bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 containing 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 μm) and bicuculline (10 μm) to block α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid/kainite receptors and GABAA receptors, respectively. Neurons were observed with a 40× water-immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared IR light, and the image was captured with an IR-sensitive charge-coupled device camera. All recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier. Upon application of negative pressure, the membrane was tightly sealed with resistance (2–10 GΩ). With additional suction, the membrane was disrupted into the whole cell configuration. The access resistances ranged from 13 to 18 MΩ with 50–70% compensation. Evoked currents were generated with a pulse from a stimulation isolation unit controlled by an S48 pulse generator (Astro-Med). A bipolar stimulating electrode (Fredrick Haer Company) was positioned ∼100μm from the neuron upon recording. Prior to stimulation, neurons (clamped at –70 mV) were depolarized to +60 mV for 3 s to fully eliminate the voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of NMDAR. Age-matched saline controls were done side-by-side with drug-injected animals on each day of experiments. To minimize variations between slices, the stimulus with the same intensity was delivered by the stimulating electrode placed at the same location. Data analyses were performed with the Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). The agents we used include serotonin, 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), α-Me-5HT, (–)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, ketanserin, benzothiazole, colchicine (Sigma), dynamin inhibitory peptide (Tocris), 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) and 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP3) (Calbiochem). They were made up as concentrated stocks in water or DMSO and stored at –20 °C. Stocks were thawed and diluted immediately prior to experiments. Animal Treatment—Young male rats (25–28 days old) were administered intraperitoneally with the drugs as described in the text. For stereotaxic injection, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and then mounted into a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments). Fluoxetine (fluox) (2 μl, 0.34 mg/ml, dissolved in saline) were injected unilaterally into the PFC region using a Hamilton syringe (22-gauge needle) at a rate of 0.5 μl/min. The coordinates of the lateral PFC used are 1.0–1.4 mm lateral from midline, 2.2 mm anterior to Bregma, and 3.3 mm dorsal to ventral. Small Interfering RNA—To knock down the endogenous β-arrestin expression, we used the small interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 mRNA (24Jiang Q. Yan Z. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The siRNA oligonucleotide sequences were: 5′-GGCGAGUCUACGUGACACUtt-3′ (for β-arrestin1) and 5′-GGACCGGAASGUGUUUGUGtt-3′ (for β-arrestin2). The siRNA (purchased from Ambion, Austin, TX) was co-transfected with enhanced GFP into cultured PFC neurons (11 days in vitro) using the Lipofectamine 2000 method. Biochemical, immunocytochemical, or electrophysiological experiments were performed in neurons after 2–3 days of transfection. Measurement of Free Tubulin—Free tubulin from PFC cultures was extracted as described previously (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cultured PFC neurons (2 × 105 cells/cm2, 14 days in vitro) in 3.5-cm dishes were washed twice at 37 °C with 1 ml of microtubule stabilizing buffer containing (0.1 m MES (pH 6.75), 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 m glycerol). Cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 600 μl of soluble tubulin extraction buffer (0.1 m MES (pH 6.75), 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 m glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with the addition of protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The soluble extract was centrifuged at 37 °C for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected. Equal amounts of total protein were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). The intensity of tubulin bands was quantitatively analyzed with Image (National Institutes of Health). Immunocytochemical Staining—The detection of surface GFP-NR2B (25Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was performed as how we described before (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29420-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured PFC neurons were treated with various agents after transfection, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature without permeabilization. After incubating in 5% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific staining, cells were incubated with the anti-GFP antibody (1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 200, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence images were detected using a 60× objective with a cooled charge-coupled device camera mounted on a Nikon microscope. The surface GFP-NR2B clusters were analyzed with ImageJ software. All specimens were imaged under identical conditions and analyzed with identical parameters. A 50-μm segment of dendrite was selected from the equal distance away from the soma of four to six individual neurons. To define dendritic clusters, a single threshold was selected manually. Signal was counted as clusters when its intensity was 2- to 3-fold greater than the overall fluorescence on the dendritic shaft. Three to four independent experiments were performed. Quantitative analyses were performed blindly without knowledge of experimental conditions. Biochemical Measurement of Surface Receptors—After treatment, PFC slices were incubated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 20 min on ice. The slices were then rinsed three times in Tris-buffered saline to quench the biotin reaction, followed by homogenization in 300 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 15 μg of homogenates was removed to measure total proteins. For surface protein detection, 150 μg of homogenates was incubated with 100 μl of 50% NeutrAvidin-Agarose (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C, and bound proteins were resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled. Quantitative Western blots were performed on both total and biotinylated (surface) proteins using anti-NR1, anti-NR2B (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and anti-GABAAR β2/3 (Chemicon). Activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C Receptors Regulates NMDAR-mediated Ionic and Synaptic Currents in a Counteractive Manner—We have previously found that activation of 5-HT1A receptors reduces NMDAR currents in PFC pyramidal neurons (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To examine the potential interactions between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors on NMDAR functions, we tested the impact of 5-HT2 activation on 5-HT1A regulation of NMDAR currents by preincubating PFC cultures with the 5-HT2A/C agonist α-Me-5HT (20 μm, 10–30 min). Application of NMDA (100 μm) elicited an inward current that was partially desensitized and was completely eliminated by the NMDA receptor antagonist d-aminophosphonovalerate (50 μm). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), application of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (20 μm) reversibly reduced NMDAR currents (21.3 ± 0.7%, n = 16). However, in α-Me-5HT-treated neurons, the reduction of NMDAR current by 8-OH-DPAT was substantially attenuated (6.4 ± 0.7%, n = 8). α-Me-5HT alone did not significantly affect NMDAR currents (1 μm: 4.0 ± 0.8%, n = 5; 20 μm: 5.7 ± 1.4%, n = 7). Another 5-HT2A/C agonist DOI also had no effect on NMDAR currents at low doses (0.05 μm: 4.2 ± 1.2%, n = 5; 0.1 μm: 4.0 ± 2.5%, n = 5), which are different from the inhibitory effect of DOI shown before (26Arvanov V.L. Liang X. Russo A. Wang R.Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3064-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The discrepancy may be due to different experimental procedures in recording NMDA-induced currents. In a previous study (26Arvanov V.L. Liang X. Russo A. Wang R.Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3064-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), microdrops of NMDA (1 mm, every 15 min) were applied to PFC slices, which did not allow the accurate detection of peak NMDA currents because of the slow diffusion of the ligand. Moreover, it was not a pure postsynaptic preparation like dissociated neurons, which could have indirect effects due to changes in the circuit. Our results suggest that 5-HT2A/C activation alone does not directly affect NMDAR currents but opposes 5-HT1A regulation of NMDAR currents in PFC pyramidal neurons. We further tested the influence of 5-HT2 activation on 5-HT1A regulation of NMDAR-EPSC mediated by synaptic NMDA receptors in PFC slices. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), application of 8-OH-DPAT potently reduced the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSC (37.1 ± 2.1%; n = 10 (Fig. 1F)). However, this reduction was significantly attenuated in the presence of α-Me-5HT (10.4 ± 0.7%; n = 13 (Fig. 1F)). To verify that 5-HT2A/C receptors were mediating this regulatory effect of α-Me-5HT, we pre-treated PFC slices with the specific 5-HT2A/C antagonist ketanserin (20 μm). As shown in Fig. 1E, α-Me-5HT failed to oppose the effect of 5-HT1A on NMDAR-EPSC in the presence of ketanserin (36.8 ± 7.1%; n = 5 (Fig. 1F)). In contrast, the reduction of NMDAR-EPSC by 8-OH-DPAT was intact in the presence of the 5-HT4 agonist benzothiazole (20 μm, 33 ± 2.9%; n = 5 (Fig. 1F)). These results indicate that 5-HT2A/C receptor activation selectively counteracts 5-HT1A regulation of NMDAR functions in PFC pyramidal neurons. We next examined what would happen when both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors are co-activated by serotonin. If both signals oppose each other, then blocking one receptor activation would unmask the effect of the other. Thus, we tested the effect of serotonin on NMDAR-EPSC in PFC slices treated with or without 5-HT2 antagonists. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), different concentrations of serotonin reduced the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSC to different extents (10 μm:21 ± 2.3%, n = 4; 40 μm: 28.5 ± 4.9%, n = 4; 100 μm: 29.4 ± 4.8%, n = 5). However, in the presence of the 5-HT2A/C antagonist ketanserin (20 μm), the reduction of NMDAR-EPSC by serotonin was greatly augmented (10 μm: 35.2 ± 2.2%, n = 7; 40 μm: 43.0 ± 2.0%, n = 6; 100 μm:47 ± 1.9%, n = 7). It suggests that 5-HT2 receptor activation in response to serotonin masks part of the inhibitory action of 5-HT1A receptors on NMDAR channels. To assess whether the serotonergic regulation of NMDARs, which we found in vitro, is also occurring in vivo, we tested whether endogenous serotonin, via the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors, could regulate NMDAR functions in a similar manner in intact animals. First, we examined NMDAR-EPSC in PFC slices from animals intraperitoneally injected with 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A/C agonists. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSC was significantly smaller in animals intraperitoneally injected with the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (saline: 379.8 ± 8.9 pA, n = 8; DPAT: 166 ± 11.5 pA, n = 11; p < 0.001, ANOVA), whereas it was largely unaltered by injecting the 5-HT2A/C agonist α-Me-5HT (349 ± 12.2 pA, n = 10). However, the effect of 8-OH-DPAT injection was blocked by injecting α-Me-5HT (DPAT + α-Me-5HT: 335 ± 15.9 pA, n = 12). These results indicate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors in vivo down-regulates NMDAR functions, and this effect of 5-HT1A is opposed by 5-HT2A/C receptor activation in vivo. Moreover, the amplitude of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor-EPSC was unchanged by 8-OH-DPAT injection (saline: 113 ± 11.8 pA, n = 11; DPAT: 112 ± 9.9 pA, n = 10), suggesting that 5-HT1A activation in PFC is specifically targeting postsynaptic NMDARs rather than presynaptic glutamate release. Next, we examined NMDAR-EPSC in PFC slices from animals intraperitoneally injected with the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) to elevate endogenous 5-HT levels at synapses. As shown in Fig. 3B, the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSC in fluoxetine-injected animals was significantly smaller, compared with saline controls (saline: 403.5 ± 15.8 pA, n = 11; fluox: 195.1 ± 12.4 pA, n = 14; p < 0.001, ANOVA). This effect of fluoxetine was blocked by injecting the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (WAY: 367 ± 12.9 pA, n = 12; WAY + fluox: 390 ± 15.8 pA, n = 12), suggesting the mediation by 5-HT1A receptors. Moreover, the reducing effect of fluoxetine on NMDAR-EPSC was potentiated by injecting the 5-HT2A/C antagonist ketanserin (ket: 392 ± 12.3 pA, n = 11; ket + fluox: 59.6 ± 5.2 pA, n = 12; p < 0.001, ANOVA), revealing the counteracting effect of 5-HT2A/C on 5-HT1A regulation of synaptic NMDA responses. Moreover, the effect of bath application of 8-OH-DPAT (40 μm) on NMDAR-EPSC was occluded in animals injected with fluoxetine, as compared with saline controls (Fig. 3C, saline: 40.2 ± 1.9%, n = 5, fluox: 10.5 ± 2.5%, n = 6), confirming the common mechanism underlying the in vivo fluoxetine effect and in vitro 8-OH-DPAT effect on NMDARs. In contrast to the strong effect in PFC pyramidal neurons, fluoxetine injection failed to affect NMDAR-EPSC in striatal medium spiny neurons (saline: 375 ± 15.9 pA, n = 8; fluox: 351 ± 13.9 pA, n = 10), suggesting the specificity of serotonergic regulation of NMDARs in PFC. To further test the effect of 5-HT on NMDARs in PFC networks in vivo without affecting other circuits, we also performed stereotaxic injection of fluoxetine to PFC to elevate the local 5-HT levels. We found that the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSC in PFC pyramidal neurons localized at the proximity of injection sites was significantly smaller, compared with saline controls (saline: 401 ± 10.1 pA, n = 11; fluox: 162 ± 13.2 pA, n = 11, p < 0.001, ANOVA). The Opposing Regulation of NMDA Receptors by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 Receptors Depends on Microtubule Stability—Next, we investigated the potential mechanism by which 5-HT2 receptors counteract the effect of 5-HT1A on NMDAR currents in PFC neurons. Previously, we have found that 5-HT1A disrupts NMDA receptor trafficking by destabilizing microtubule integrity (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether microtubule dynamics is the convergent target of 5-HT1A- and 5-HT2A-mediated signaling. To test this, we compared the level of free (depolymerized) tubulin in PFC cultures subjected to 8-OH-DPAT treatment in the absence or presence of α-Me5HT. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), application of 8-OH-DPAT (40 μm, 20 min) caused a potent increase in free tubulin (1.7 ± 0.3-fold increase, n = 3, p < 0.001, ANOVA), however, this effect was significantly blocked by α-Me-5HT (20 μm, 0.6 ± 0.2-fold increase, n = 3), indicating that 5-HT2 activation could increase microtubule stability and prevent 5-HT1A-induced microtubule depolymerization. We then tested whether the counteractive effect of 5-HT2 on 5-HT1A regulation of NMDAR currents is due to the opposing regulation of microtubule dynamics by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), bath application of the microtubule depolymerizer, colchicine (30 μm), gradually reduced NMDAR-EPSC in PFC slices (38.0 ± 2.9%, n = 5, also see Ref. 22Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29420-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), mimicking and occluding the 5-HT1A effect (21Yuen E.Y. Jiang Q. Chen P. Gu Z. Feng J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5488-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, this inhibitory effect of colchicine was largely attenuated in the presence of α-Me-5HT (20 μm, 11.2 ± 13.4%, n = 6). These results suggest that activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors could regulate NMDAR currents in a counteractive manner by converging on microtubule dynamics.

https://openalex.org/W2030554179,"Corynebacterium glutamicum contains four serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) named PknA, PknB, PknG, and PknL. Here we present the first biochemical and comparative analysis of all four C. glutamicum STPKs and investigate their potential role in cell shape control and peptidoglycan synthesis during cell division. In vitro assays demonstrated that, except for PknG, all STPKs exhibited autokinase activity. We provide evidence that activation of PknG is part of a phosphorylation cascade mechanism that relies on PknA activity. Following phosphorylation by PknA, PknG could transphosphorylate its specific substrate OdhI in vitro. A mass spectrometry profiling approach was also used to identify the phosphoresidues in all four STPKs. The results indicate that the nature, number, and localization of the phosphoacceptors varies from one kinase to the other. Disruption of either pknL or pknG in C. glutamicum resulted in viable mutants presenting a typical cell morphology and growth rate. In contrast, we failed to obtain null mutants of pknA or pknB, supporting the notion that these genes are essential. Conditional mutants of pknA or pknB were therefore created, leading to partial depletion of PknA or PknB. This resulted in elongated cells, indicative of a cell division defect. Moreover, overexpression of PknA or PknB in C. glutamicum resulted in a lack of apical growth and therefore a coccoid-like morphology. These findings indicate that pknA and pknB are key players in signal transduction pathways for the regulation of the cell shape and both are essential for sustaining corynebacterial growth.

Corynebacterium glutamicum is a leading industrial amino acid producer and a model organism of the Corynebacteriaceae, a suborder of the actinomycetes that also includes the genus Mycobacterium. This soil-borne, nonpathogenic Gram-positive actinomycete, which is widely used in the industrial production of amino acids, such as l-lysine and l-glutamic acid (1Hermann T. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), has been extensively studied leading to the development of efficient genetic manipulation systems (3Letek M. Ordonez E. Fiuza M. Honrubia-Marcos P. Vaquera J. Gil J.A. Castro D. Mateos L.M. Int. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 271-282PubMed Google Scholar). The genetics of cell growth and cell division of C. glutamicum started even before the complete genome sequence was available. The earliest studies focused on the sequencing and characterization of corynebacterial genes present in the conserved division and cell wall cluster (2Letek M. Valbuena N. Ramos A. Ordonez E. Gil J.A. Mateos L.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Once the genome sequence was available, it was evident that this bacterium, as well as different members of the actinomycetes, was deficient in many essential genes for cell division (3Letek M. Ordonez E. Fiuza M. Honrubia-Marcos P. Vaquera J. Gil J.A. Castro D. Mateos L.M. Int. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 271-282PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore corresponded to a minimalist version of a more sophisticated cell division apparatus (divisome) present in other bacteria. For instance, C. glutamicum is lacking genes homologue to ftsA (an actin homologue), to positive regulators involved in FtsZ polymerization such as zipA or zapA, or to negative regulators such as ezrA, noc, slmA, sulA, and minCD (3Letek M. Ordonez E. Fiuza M. Honrubia-Marcos P. Vaquera J. Gil J.A. Castro D. Mateos L.M. Int. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 271-282PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several essential cell division genes (i.e. ftsN and ftsL) are absent in C. glutamicum. Unlike other bacterial models, peptidoglycan (PG) 3The abbreviations used are: PG, peptidoglycan; STPK, serine/threonine protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DAPI, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; PASTA, penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine kinase-associated; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; TEV, tobacco etch virus; Van-FL, fluorescent vancomycin. 3The abbreviations used are: PG, peptidoglycan; STPK, serine/threonine protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DAPI, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; PASTA, penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine kinase-associated; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; TEV, tobacco etch virus; Van-FL, fluorescent vancomycin. biosynthesis in corynebacteria occurs at the septum and the cell poles (4Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 5Letek M. Ordonez E. Vaquera J. Margolin W. Flardh K. Mateos L.M. Gil J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3283-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and not at the lateral cell wall like in Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. With respect to PG biosynthesis, C. glutamicum possesses only nine penicillin-binding proteins, in contrast to E. coli or B. subtilis that contain 13 and 16 penicillin-binding proteins, respectively (6Scheffers D.J. Jones L.J. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which C. glutamicum shifts between synthesis of PG at mid-cell for cell division or at the cell poles for cell elongation remains unclear, although this process is likely to be regulated in response to different stimuli encountered during growth. Protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism by which environmental signals are transmitted to control protein activities in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Three main superfamilies of protein kinases are described as follows, the first one includes the “eukaryotic like” serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) (7Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye S. Inouye M. Cell. 1991; 67: 995-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 8Zhang W. Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye M. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5450-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shi L. Potts M. Kennelly P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 229-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the second one corresponds to the newly characterized prokaryotic class of tyrosine kinases (10Grangeasse C. Cozzone A.J. Deutscher J. Mijakovic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 86-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); and the third one corresponds to the well known family of bacterial kinases, the sensor histidine kinases, which are key enzymes of the so-called “two-component systems” (11Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the presence of several STPKs suggests a central role of protein phosphorylation in regulating various biological functions, ranging from environmental adaptive responses to bacterial pathogenicity, like in the actinomycete relative Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12Narayan A. Sachdeva P. Sharma K. Saini A.K. Tyagi A.K. Singh Y. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 29: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Hett E.C. Rubin E.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 126-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, regulatory devices involving STPKs and phosphatases represent an emerging theme in prokaryotic signaling cascades. We therefore addressed the question whether STPKs could be involved in the model of growth in C. glutamicum. In silico analysis of the genome sequence of C. glutamicum predicted the presence of four different STPKs (14Kalinowski J. Bathe B. Bartels D. Bischoff N. Bott M. Burkovski A. Dusch N. Eggeling L. Eikmanns B.J. Gaigalat L. Goesmann A. Hartmann M. Huthmacher K. Kramer R. Linke B. McHardy A.C. Meyer F. Mockel B. Pfefferle W. Puhler A. Rey D.A. Ruckert C. Rupp O. Sahm H. Wendisch V.F. Wiegrabe I. Tauch A. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Three of these appear to be transmembrane proteins, with a putative extracellular signal sensor domain and an intracellular kinase domain. One of them, PknG, presented as a soluble kinase, has been investigated for its physiological role (15Niebisch A. Kabus A. Schultz C. Weil B. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12300-12307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that in M. tuberculosis the STPKs PknA and PknB regulate cell growth (16Kang C.M. Abbott D.W. Park S.T. Dascher C.C. Cantley L.C. Husson R.N. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1692-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and cell division (17Dasgupta A. Datta P. Kundu M. Basu J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Thakur M. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40107-40113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because of the conserved genetic organization of the pknA/pknB cluster in M. tuberculosis and C. glutamicum, it is tempting to speculate that cell shape and division are also regulated by phosphorylation in C. glutamicum. In this study, we focused on the four putative STPKs of C. glutamicum. As a first step in deciphering the potential role/participation of these kinases in the cell division process, the four proteins were characterized biochemically through a combination of in vitro phosphorylation assays and mass spectrometric analysis of their phosphorylation sites. We also demonstrated that either overexpression or depletion of PknA and PknB in C. glutamicum causes major growth and morphological changes, very likely resulting from cell division and cell wall biosynthesis alterations. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Conjugal Plasmids—Bacterial strains and plasmids are described in Table 1. Strains used for cloning and expression of recombinant proteins were E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) and E. coli BL21(DE3)Star (Stratagene), respectively. E. coli cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 50 μg/ml kanamycin, when required. C. glutamicum cells were grown at 30 °C in TSB (trypticase soy broth, Oxoid) or TSA (TSB containing 2% agar) medium supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml kanamycin. Plasmids to be transferred by conjugation from E. coli to C. glutamicum were introduced by transformation into the donor strain E. coli S17-1. Mobilization of plasmids from E. coli to coryneform strains was accomplished as described previously (19Mateos L.M. Schafer A. Kalinowski J. Martin J.F. Puhler A. J.

Recombinant E. coli strains harboring the pGEX4T-3 derivatives were used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until A600 reached 0.5. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added at a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and growth was continued for an additional 3-h period at 30 °C. Recombinant GST kinase cytoplasmic regions were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix as described previously (20Molle V. Kremer L. Girard-Blanc C. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Prost J.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15300-15309Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For the cloning, expression, and purification of the cytoplasmic PknG recombinant protein (822 residues), the full-length pknG gene was amplified by PCR using C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 genomic DNA as a template and the primer pair pknG1 and pknGfull2 (Table 2). This PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes corresponding to the appropriate sites at both ends and ligated into pETTev (Table 1), the variant of pET15b (Novagen) that includes the replacement of the thrombin site coding sequence with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site (21Cohen-Gonsaud M.

E. coli BL21(DE3)Star cells transformed with this construction were used for expression and purification of His-tagged PknG as described previously (22Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J.

Construction and Purification of OdhI Recombinant Protein—The odhI gene was amplified by PCR using C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 genomic DNA as a template and the primer pair 534/535, containing an NdeI and NheI restriction site, respectively. This 432-bp amplified product was digested by NdeI and NheI, and ligated into pETTev (Table 1) generating the pTEVOdhI. E. coli BL21(DE3)Star cells transformed with this construct were used for expression and purification of His-tagged OdhI as described previously (22Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J.

Finally, the purified His-tagged OdhI was treated with TEV protease according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Gene Inactivation in C. glutamicum—Internal fragments of the pknA, pknB, pknG, and pknL genes were amplified from the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 chromosome using pknAint1/pknAint2, pknBint1/pknBint2, pknGint1/pknGint2, and pkn-Lint1/pknLint2 primer pairs (Table 2), respectively. The amplified 485-, 502-, 849-, and 754-bp DNA fragments were purified and cloned into pGEM-TEasy (Table 1) and later were digested and subcloned into the conjugative suicide plasmid pK18mob (Table 1), yielding to plasmids pKAint, pKBint, pKGint, and pKLint, respectively (Table 1). All these plasmids were used to disrupt the C. glutamicum pkn genes by single recombination. The corresponding DNA inserts were used as probes in Southern blot experiments to confirm gene disruption. Total DNA from corynebacteria was isolated using the Kirby method described for Streptomyces (23Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chen B.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Institute, Norwich, UK2000: 161-220Google Scholar), except that the cells were treated with lysozyme for 4 h at 30 °C. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA from different C. glutamicum transconjugants were digested with different restriction enzymes and loaded on agarose gels. Samples were transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled probes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) and conventional protocols. To reduce the PknA or PknB levels in C. glutamicum, two sets of plasmids were designed to express either pknA or pknB under the control of Plac and PgntK promoters. Plasmids pKLA and pKLB were constructed as follows. The first 472-bp pknA fragment or the 470-bp pknB fragment was amplified by PCR using pknAlac1/pknAlac2 and pknBlac1/pknBlac2, respectively (Table 2), digested with EcoRI and HindIII/XbaI, and subcloned into the EcoRI-HindIII/XbaI sites of pK18mob (Table 1). To place pknA or pknB under the control of the regulated promoter PgntK (promoter of the gntK gene encoding the gluconate kinase from C. glutamicum) (2Letek M. Valbuena N. Ramos A. Ordonez E. Gil J.A. Mateos L.M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the 5′-ends of pknA (472 bp) and pknB (470 bp) were PCR-amplified using the pknA1/pknAK and pknB1/pknAK primer pairs, respectively (Table 2), digested with NdeI and DraI/EcoRV, and subcloned into NdeI/EcoRI (Klenow-filled) digested plasmid pKPD (Table 1), yielding to plasmids pKPKA and pKPKB, respectively. To study the expression of the four pkn genes in C. glutamicum under the control of the strong promoter Pdiv (promoter of the divIVA gene from C. glutamicum) (5Letek M. Ordonez E. Vaquera J. Margolin W. Flardh K. Mateos L.M. Gil J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3283-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Letek M. Fiuza M. Ordonez E. Villadaneos A.F. Ranos A. Mateos L.M. Gil J.A. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 10.1007/S10482-008-9224-4PubMed Google Scholar), plasmids pECDA/B/G/L were constructed as follows: pknA/B/G/L were PCR-amplified using the primer pairs pknA1/pknA2, pknB1/pknB2, pknG1/pknG2, or pknL1/pknG2, digested with NdeI, and subsequently cloned under the control of the Pdiv promoter into plasmid pEDiv (Table 1). Microscopic Techniques—Living C. glutamicum cells or cells stained with fluorescent dyes were observed in a Nikon E400 phase contrast and fluorescence microscope. Pictures were taken with a DN100 Nikon digital camera. Vancomycin BODIPY-FL (VAN-FL) (Molecular Probes) staining was performed by adding an equal proportion of unlabeled vancomycin and Van-FL to growing cultures at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml (4Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 min to allow absorption of the antibiotic, cells were directly observed by fluorescence microscopy. Staining with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was performed as described previously (25Daniel R.A. Harry E.J. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro phosphorylation of each recombinant kinase (0.5 μg) was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing buffer P (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) with 200 μCi/ml [γ-33P]ATP corresponding to 65 nm (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and heating the mixture at 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 20% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 90 °C, stained with Coomassie Blue, and dried. Radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using direct exposure films. For mass spectrometry analysis, kinases were phosphorylated as described above, excepted that [γ-33P]ATP was replaced with 5 mm ATP. Sample Preparation and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Purified GST-PknACD, GST-PknBCD, GST-PknLCD, and His-PknG were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation with nonradioactive ATP prior to resolving on SDS-PAGE. In-gel digestion was performed as described by Shevchenko et al. (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7783) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Samples were reduced with 60 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 40 min at 56 °C. Alkylation was performed with 60 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The gel pieces were successively dried, re-hydrated, and re-dried using 300 μl of CH3CN, 200 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, and 300 μl of CH3CN, respectively. For proteolytic digestion, the protein-containing gel pieces were treated with 30–40 μl of trypsin (sequence grade, Promega, Madison, WI) for 45 min at 50 °C. A second extraction step was performed using 30 μl of H2O/CH3CN/HCOOH (60:36:4; v/v/v) mixture for 30 min at 30 °C, and finally all extracts were pooled and dried in a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (20 μl). NanoLC/nanospray/tandem mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a Q-STAR XL instrument (QqTOF) (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) equipped with a nanospray source using a distal coated silica-tip emitter (FS 150-20-10-D-20, New Objective) set at 2300 V. By means of information-dependent acquisition mode, peptide ions within a m/z 400–2000 survey scan mass range were analyzed for subsequent fragmentation (three precursors). Double to quadruple charged ions exceeding a threshold of 10 counts were selected for MS/MS analyses. MS/MS spectra were acquired in the m/z 50–2000 range with a 30-s dynamic exclusion time. The collision energy was automatically set by the software (Analyst 1.1) and was related to the charge of the precursor ion. The MS and MS/MS data were recalibrated using internal reference ions from a trypsin autolysis peptide at m/z 842.510 [M + H]+ and m/z 421.759 [M + 2H]2+. Screening for phosphorylated peptides was achieved by the paragon method from the Protein-Pilot® data base-searching software (version 2.0, Applied Biosystems). The LC part of the analytical system consisted of an LC-Packings nano-LC (Dionex, Voisins Le Bretonneux, France). Chromatographic separation of peptides was obtained inaC18 PepMap micro-precolumn (5 μm; 100 Å; 300 μm × 5 mm; Dionex) and a C18 PepMap nano-column (3 μm; 100 Å; 75 μm × 150 mm; Dionex). After injection (1-μl injection volume, pick-up mode, in a 20-μl injection loop), samples were adsorbed and desalted on the pre-column with a H2O/CH3CN/trifluoroacetic acid (98:2:0.05; v/v/v) solvent mixture for 3 min at 25 μl/min flow rate. The peptide separation was developed using a linear 60-min gradient from 0 to 60% B, where solvent A was 0.1% HCOOH in H2O/CH3CN (95/5) and solvent B was 0.1% HCOOH in H2O/CH3CN (20/80) at ∼200 nl/min flow rate. Genome Sequence Analysis of C. glutamicum for STPKs Encoding Genes—Examination of the C. glutamicum genome sequence revealed the presence of four putative genes encoding STPKs, all of which belong to the PKN2 family of prokaryotic protein kinases that are most closely related to the eukaryotic STPKs (27Leonard C.J. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To date, the corynebacterial STPKs have been characterized to a limited extent. Only one of them, PknG, has been shown to participate in glutamine utilization (15Niebisch A. Kabus A. Schultz C. Weil B. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12300-12307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas the others (PknA, PknB, and PknL) remained uncharacterized. The genes encoding PknA and PknB are located, as in M. tuberculosis (16Kang C.M. Abbott D.W. Park S.T. Dascher C.C. Cantley L.C. Husson R.N.

Extracellular matrix macromolecules present cancer cells with a structural barrier that serves to limit their unregulated growth and movement (1Seiki M.

In turn, cancer cells have been postulated to use matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane type 1 MMP; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TIMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; Cyto D, cytochalasin D. 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane type 1 MMP; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TIMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; Cyto D, cytochalasin D. a class of zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes, as a means to dissolve these extracellular matrix barriers during neoplastic progression (1Seiki M.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 9-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Although the human MMP family is comprised of 16 secreted and seven membrane-tethered enzymes, increasing evidence suggests that a subclass of the membrane-anchored proteinases, termed the membrane type (MT) MMPs, plays dominant roles in controlling cancer cell behavior (1Seiki M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 4Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp.

Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). The MT-MMPs are expressed either as type I transmembrane proteins (i.e. MT1, 2, 3, and 5 MMPs) or in a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored format (i.e. MT4- and MT6-MMP) (1Seiki M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Among these enzymes, MT1-MMP is considered to be the family member most closely linked to neoplastic cell behavior (6Remacle A.G. Rozanov D.V. Baciu P.C. Chekanov A.V. Golubkov V.S. Strongin A.Y. J.

Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that MT1-MMP plays a direct and essential role in allowing tumor cells to degrade and invade multiple connective tissue barriers through a mechanism independent of MMP-2, an effector protease that operates downstream of MT1-MMP (4Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 7Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H.

Synthesized as a catalytically inactive proenzyme, the MT1-MMP precursor undergoes proteolytic processing in the transGolgi complex wherein the prodomain is removed by members of the proprotein convertase family (9Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the mature enzyme traffics to the plasma membrane via a process controlled by Rab8 and the microtubular apparatus (6Remacle A.G. Rozanov D.V. Baciu P.C. Chekanov A.V. Golubkov V.S. Strongin A.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Bravo-Cordero J.J. Marrero-Diaz R. Megias D. Genis L. Garcia-Grande A. Garcia M.A. Arroyo A.G. Montoya M.C. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1499-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Little is known with regard to the signaling molecules that mobilize MT1-MMP to the cell surface, but EGF, an extracellular ligand of EGF receptor family members (EGFRs; also known as ERBB/HERs), has been reported to induce cancer invasion by modulating MT1-MMP expression (11Sato T.

Fillmore H.L. Neuro-oncol. 2004; 6: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Once delivered to the cell surface, the short cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP regulates its internalization and turnover at the plasma membrane, possibly through its interactions with adaptor protein 2, which resides in clathrin-coated pits (13Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 14Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Migrating cells are then thought to localize MT1-MMP to various cellular domains by complex processes involving caveolar proteins, the actin network, and extracellular binding partners (5Itoh Y.

Src kinase has also been shown to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP and regulate its functions (18Nyalendo C. Michaud M. Beaulieu E. Roghi C. Murphy G. Gingras D. Beliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15690-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Despite these insights, however, few of these principles have been evaluated directly because techniques have not yet been developed for monitoring MT1-MMP activity with subcellular resolution in live cells. Recent advances in fluorescent probes have enabled the study of protein activity and distribution in live cells (19Pertz O. Hahn K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Giepmans B.N. Adams S.R. Ellisman M.H. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2006; 312: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we previously developed a biosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor Src activity in real time at the single cell level (21Wang Y. Botvinick E.L. Zhao Y. Berns M.W. Usami S. Tsien R.Y. Chien S. Nature. 2005; 434: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We report here the development and characterization of a new, FRET-based MT1-MMP biosensor (GenBank™ accession number EU545473) anchored at the plasma membrane wherein a MT1-MMP-sensitive substrate has been concatenated between the high efficiency FRET pair, ECFP and YPet (22Nguyen A.W. Daugherty P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Utilizing this biosensor, MT1-MMP activity and distribution have been resolved in live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. Further, new mechanistic insights have been developed into the means by which the local activity of MT1-MMP is coordinated at the surface of migrating cancer cells. Protein Expression, in Vitro Spectroscopy, and Cleavage Assays—Chimeric proteins were expressed with N-terminal His6 tags in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel chelation chromatography as described (21Wang Y. Botvinick E.L. Zhao Y. Berns M.W. Usami S. Tsien R.Y. Chien S. Nature. 2005; 434: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Emission ratios of ECFP/YPet (476 nm/526 nm) were measured by a fluorescence plate reader (TECAN, Sapphire II) before and after adding the recombinant catalytic domain of human MT1-, MT2-, or MT3-MMP (2 μg/ml; Calbiochem) or of human MMP-2 or MMP-9 (6 μg/ml; Calbiochem) into the proteolysis assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, and 0.01% Brij-35, pH 6.8) at 37 °C (23Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko N.D. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining. After destaining (50% v/v methanol in water with 10% acetic acid), the protein was visualized, and the image was recorded by digital camera (Olympus). Gene Construction and DNA Plasmids—The substrate peptide sequence CPKESCNLFVLKD was derived from the MT1-MMP cleavage site identified in proMMP-2 (24Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar) and used for the MT1-MMP FRET biosensor. The YPet cDNA was amplified by PCR with a sense primer containing a BglII site and a reverse primer containing a SacI site. ECFP was amplified by PCR with a sense primer containing a SacI site and the sequence of the MT1-MMP substrate peptide and a reverse primer containing a PstI site, a stop codon, and a HindIII site. The PCR products were fused together and cloned into pRSETb (Invitrogen) using BglII/HindIII sites for bacterial expression and into pDisplay (Invitrogen) using BglII/PstI sites for mammalian cell expression (see Fig. 1A). The pDisplay vector contains an N-terminal murine Ig κ-chain leader sequence, which directs the biosensor protein to the secretory pathway, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (i.e. PDGFRβ)), which targets the biosensor protein to the plasma membrane. The cytosolic MT1-MMP biosensor for mammalian cell expression was constructed by PCR amplification of the fused full-length gene encoding the MT1-MMP biosensor and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) with BamHI and EcoRI sites. A mutant MT1-MMP biosensor was constructed by replacing the sequence encoding NL with IV in the sense primer used for YPet amplification. The mCherry-conjugated MT1-MMP was constructed by PCR amplification of the cDNA encoding MT1-MMP with a sense primer containing a HindIII site and a reverse primer containing a gene sequence encoding GGS as a linker and an EcoRI site. The PCR product of cDNA encoding mCherry was fused at the C-terminal of MT1-MMP with GGS and cloned into pcDNA3.1 with HindIII/XhoI sites. The GFP-fused EGFR construct was a gift from Dr. Sorkin at the Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado (25Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The constructs for MT1-MMP and various other plasmids: control vector (PCR3.1 Uni; Invitrogen); human MT1-MMP; catalytically inactive human MT1-MMP (E/A mutant, Glu240 → Ala); transmembrane-deleted human MT1-MMP (MT1ΔTM); cytoplasmic tail-deleted human MT1-MMP (MT1ΔCT); and human MMP-2, MMP-9, and their convertase-activable forms (MMP-2RXKR and MMP-9RXKR) have been previously published (26Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Micropatterning and Migration Assay—Glass coverslips (Fisher) were cleaned with a solution containing H2SO4 and H2O2 prior to the silanization in 2% dimethyl dichlorosilane (Aldrich) in dichlorobenzene for 10 s. The treated slips were rinsed with acetone, ethanol, and water, blown dry, and oxidized by UV-generated ozone (UVO Cleaner; Jelight, Irvine, CA) for 1 min (27Tan J.L. Liu W. Nelson C.M. Raghavan S. Chen C.S. Tissue Eng. 2004; 10: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These treated coverslips were stored at 4 °C before usage. The polydimethylsiloxane microchannel mold was created by soft lithography. Negative photo-resist Epon SU8 2015 was coated on a silicon wafer, which was then exposed to UV light through a transparency mask with parallel lines and spacing before being developed. Polydimethylsiloxane prepared by mixing two liquid components (Sylgard 184 kit; Dow Corning) was poured onto the developed wafer and cured. After solidification, the polydimethylsiloxane mold with microgrooves was peeled off and sealed on treated coverslips to create microfluidic channels. Fibronectin solution (40 μg/ml) was perfused through the channel driven by pressure gradient to coat the coverslips with defined parallel lines (10 μm in width with 30-μm spacing). The coverslips were then backfilled with pluronic acid (F127) (BASF Corporation; 0.5% in phosphate-buffered) to prevent the cell adhesion outside of the patterned areas. After co-transfection with wild-type biosensor and MT1-MMP for 36-48 h, HeLa cells were detached with 4 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) in phosphate-buffered and seeded on fibronectin-coated glass-bottomed dishes or fibronectin stripes for 3 h before EGF stimulation. Microscopy, Image Acquisition, and Analysis—Cells expressing various exogenous proteins were starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 36-48 h before EGF (50 ng/ml) treatment. During the imaging process, the cells were maintained in serum-free CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. The images were collected with a Zeiss axiovert inverted microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Cascade 512B; Photometrics) using MetaFluor 6.2 software (Universal Imaging). The parameters of dichroic mirrors, excitation and emission filters for FRET, and different fluorescence proteins are shown in supplemental Table S1. The fluorescence intensity of nontransfected cells were quantified as the background signal and subtracted from the ECFP and YPet (FRET) signals on transfected cells. There is minimal cross-talk between ECFP and YPet channels (i.e. the direct excitation of YPet with ECFP excitation wavelength and the ECFP emission bleed-through into YPet channel) with our filter settings (data not shown). Hence, the pixel-by-pixel ratio images of ECFP/YPet were directly calculated based on the background-subtracted fluorescence intensity images of ECFP and YPet by the MetaFluor software to represent the FRET efficiency and activation levels of biosensor. Emission ratios of ECFP/YPet were averaged on chosen regions of interest to allow the quantification and statistical analysis by Excel (Microsoft) and Matlab (The MathWorks). Statistical Analysis—For statistical analysis, we used the Bonferroni multiple comparison test of means at 95% confidence interval, which is provided by the multcompare function in the MATLAB statistics toolbox. In Vitro Characterization of the MT1-MMP Biosensor—To generate a sensitive biosensor for detecting MT1-MMP activity, a substrate peptide (31CPKESCNLFVLKD43) derived from the MT1-MMP cleavage site in the propeptide sequence of MMP-2 (24Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar) was flanked by a fluorescence protein pair, ECFP and YPet (22Nguyen A.W. Daugherty P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) for FRET (Fig. 1A). In this construct, we reasoned that active MT1-MMP would cleave the biosensor substrate peptide and thus separate ECFP and YPet, resulting in a change in FRET that could be tracked by an increase in the emission ratio of ECFP/YPet. Indeed, following incubation of the engineered biosensor with the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (CAT), a significant decrease in the YPet spectrum max (526 nm) was detected along with a concomitant increase in the ECFP spectrum max (476 nm), indicative of FRET attenuation (Fig. 1B). Analysis by gel electrophoresis further revealed that the biosensor can be cleaved by CAT (Fig. 1C). If, however, the critical cleavage site NL was mutated to IV (24Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar), the FRET response of the biosensor was abolished (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results indicate that MT1-MMP hydrolyzes the biosensor at the designed cleavage site, which leads to the expected FRET change in vitro. The specificity of biosensor was further examined by comparing the catalytic domains of MT1-MMP with other MMP family membranes. MT1-MMP displayed a much stronger activity toward the biosensor in comparison with MT2-MMP, MMP-2, and MMP-9, although MT3-MMP can also efficiently induce FRET change of the biosensor (Fig. 1E). Gel electrophoresis results on biosensor cleavage are consistent with the FRET signals (data not shown). These results indicate that the biosensor is sensitive to the catalytic domains of both MT1- and MT3-MMP in vitro, but not to MT2-MMP, MMP-2, and MMP-9. Targeting the MT1-MMP Biosensor to the Extracellular Face of the Cell Plasma Membrane—Because the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP is directed toward the extracellular face of the plasma membrane (1Seiki M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), the cDNA encoding the MT1-MMP biosensor was subcloned into pDisplay vector which contains an N-terminal murine Ig κ-chain leader sequence for secretory pathway targeting and a C-terminal transmembrane domain of PDGFRβ for plasma membrane targeting. Because both MT1-MMP and PDGFRβ have been demonstrated previously to colocalize at the cell surface (28Lehti K. Allen E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Holmbeck K. Miyake Y. Chun T.H. Weiss S.J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the functional domain of the biosensor protrudes outward from the surface of plasma membrane in proximity to the MT1-MMP catalytic domain (Fig. 2A). Following transfection of HeLa cells with the biosensor, the full-length construct was oriented properly on the cell surface as evidenced by the strong staining observed with an ECFP/YPet-reactive antibody in nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 2B, panels i-iii). By contrast, when cells were transfected with a biosensor construct lacking PDGFR_TM, ECFP/YPet could only be immunodetected after the membrane was permeabilized (Fig. 2B, panels iv-ix). These results confirmed that the MT1-MMP biosensor is correctly targeted to the cell surface. Of note, a portion of the membrane-targeted biosensor was localized to perinuclear regions, possibly reflecting biosensors trapped in an endo/exocytosis recycling route before being transported to the plasma membrane (29Wiley H.S. Burke P.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Functional Characterization of the MT1-MMP Biosensor in Live Cells—To begin characterizing the utility of the MT1-MMP biosensor, HeLa cells (a cell type that expresses minimal levels of endogenous MT1-MMP) (30Zhai Y. Hotary K.B. Nan B. Bosch F.X. Munoz N. Weiss S.J. Cho K.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6543-6550Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with wild-type MT1-MMP and the membrane-targeted biosensor. In the presence of EGF, a significant FRET change was induced over a 60-min monitoring period (Fig. 3A and supplemental Movie S1). By contrast, the FRET response was ablated when the NL → IV cleavage-resistant (24Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar) biosensor was coexpressed with MT1-MMP (Fig. 3B). As expected, deletion of PDGFR_TM in the biosensor probe, a modification that precludes its trafficking to the cell surface, also abolished the EGF-induced FRET response (Fig. 3C), supporting the conclusion that EGF-induced MT1-MMP activation occurs preferentially at the cell surface. Quantification of FRET responses further confirmed that EGF-induced biosensor cleavage occurs only with the wild-type membrane-anchored construct but not in the cleavage-resistant mutant or cytosol-directed biosensors (Fig. 3D). Finally, in a fashion consistent with the extracellular proteolysis of the biosensor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), an endogenous, ∼25-kDa inhibitor of MT1-MMP(7Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), reversed the EGF-induced FRET change in the MT1-MMP-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3E). The observed decrease in the ECFP/YPet emission ratio that occurred in the presence of TIMP-2 is most likely attributed to an enhanced turnover rate of the biosensor as well as MT1-MMP at the plasma membrane upon EGF stimulation (see “Discussion”). To further delineate the structural characteristics that underlie the MT1-MMP-dependent hydrolysis of the biosensor, EGF-treated HeLa cells were co-transfected with MT1-MMP constructs harboring either an inactivating point mutation in the catalytic domain (14Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (i.e. MT1 (E/A)) or a transmembrane-deletion mutant that results in the secretion of a truncated, but active, form of the enzyme (6Remacle A.G. Rozanov D.V. Baciu P.C. Chekanov A.V. Golubkov V.S. Strongin A.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (i.e. MT1ΔTM). In either case, EGF was unable to induce a significant FRET response in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, HeLa cells transfected with either MMP-2 or MMP-9 did not generate a significant FRET response following EGF treatment (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1). By contrast, when the cytosolic tail of MT1-MMP was deleted (MT1ΔCT), the membrane-tethered mutant generated a high ECFP/YPet ratio with or without EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1). Western blot analysis of cell lysates further revealed that EGF triggered biosensor cleavage only in cells transfected with MT1-MMP, as evidenced by the generation of a ∼35-kDa fragment of the biosensor (supplemental Fig. S2), most likely reflecting the ECFP-PDGFR_TM fusion protein that remains tethered to the plasma membrane after cleavage (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, MT1ΔCT resulted in a very low level of both intact and cleaved biosensors (supplemental Fig. S2), possibly representing a sustained high level of cleavage and degradation of the biosensor. Serum-supplemented medium also induced a FRET change in biosensor-expressing cells transfected with wild-type MT1-MMP, but not MT1 (E/A) or the control vector (supplemental Fig. S3). Further examination revealed that in the presence of serum, the biosensor is sensitive to MT1-MMP, but not to wild-type or constitutively active forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Fig. 4B). The expression of MMP-2 or MMP-9 with MT1-MMP did not cause significant increase in FRET changes when comparing with cells expressing MT1-MMP only. Interestingly, although the catalytic domain of MT3-MMP displayed a substantial activity toward the biosensor in vitro (Fig. 1E), in live cells, the biosensor is most sensitive to MT1-MMP as compared with MT2- or MT3-MMP (Fig. 4B). Hence, in live cells, the biosensor preferably monitors the activity of MT1-MMP, although MT2- and MT3-MMP may also contribute to the signal depending on their respective levels of activities. To monitor the ability of the biosensor to detect endogenous MT1-MMP activity, FRET imaging was assessed in (i) HT-1080 cells that are known to express high levels of the proteinase or (ii) mouse dermal fibroblasts isolated from either MT1MMP+/+ or MT1-MMP-/- mice (7Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Among these cells, the ECFP/YPet emission ratio was highest in HT-1080 cells, modest in wild-type fibroblasts, and lowest in MT1-MMP-/- fibro-blasts (Fig. 4C). Western blot analyses confirmed that the expression of MT1-MMP in MT1-MMP-/- fibroblasts is ablated (supplemental Fig. S4). Although the wild-type fibro-blasts generate only a modest signal (consistent with their low level of MT1-MMP activity (7Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar)), the addition of the synthetic MMP inhibitor, GM6001, caused strong FRET changes while exerting only small effects on MT1-MMP-/- cells (supplemental Fig. S5), presumably because of their MT3-MMP activity (31Hotary K.B. Yana I. Sabeh F. Li X.Y. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Allen E.D. Hiraoka N. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These results reinforced the note that MT1-MMP plays a more dominant role than MT3-MMP in biosensor cleavage. Because both MT1-MMP and EGFR are abundant in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (32deFazio A. Chiew Y.E. Donoghue C. Lee C.S. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18008-18012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), we further examined whether the biosensor can monitor the dynamic activation of endogenous MT1-MMP in response to EGF stimulation. Indeed, a significant FRET change was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells upon EGF stimulation with the highest level of activity found at the cell periphery (Fig. 4D). Time course analyses further revealed that this EGF-induced FRET change was inhibited by TIMP-2 and GM6001 (a general, synthetic MMP inhibitor (34Varon C. Tatin F. Moreau V.

In the present study, we observed that treatment of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells with TA led to cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and apoptosis. The actions of TA were correlated with proteasome-dependent degradation of Cdk4, cyclin D1, Raf-1, Akt, and mutant p53, which are heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) client proteins. TA treatment induced a transient increase in reactive oxygen species and a decrease in the intracellular glutathione contents. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE revealed that TA rapidly and selectively induced thiol oxidation and aggregation of Hsp90 and Hsp70, both in intact cells and in cell-free systems using purified recombinant proteins. Furthermore, TA inhibited the chaperone activity of Hsp90-Hsp70 complex in the luciferase refolding assay. N-Acetylcysteine, a thiol antioxidant, prevented all of the TA-induced effects, including oxidation of heat shock proteins, degradation of Hsp90 client proteins, and apoptosis. In contrast, non-thiol antioxidants (trolox and vitamin C) were ineffective to prevent Hsp90 inhibition and cell death. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the TA inhibits the activity of Hsp90-Hsp70 chaperone complex, at least in part, by a direct thiol oxidation, which in turn leads to the destabilization and depletion of Hsp90 client proteins and thus causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, TA can be considered as a new type of inhibitor of Hsp90-Hsp70 chaperone complex, which has the potential to be developed as a novel strategy for cancer treatment.

Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer death in women throughout the world. Although hormonal therapy is effective for the treatment of most patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, resistance to hormonal agents is frequent (1Lopez-Otin C. Diamandis E.P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Chemotherapy is a major treatment modality for hormone refractory breast cancer and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. However, women with advanced metastatic breast cancer that is resistant to hormonal therapy usually respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy (2Gagnon J. Shaker S. Primeau M. Hurtubise A. Momparler R. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2003; 14: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new effective agents for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.Activation of apoptosis pathways is a key mechanism by which anticancer drugs kill tumor cells (3Kim R. Tanabe K. Uchida Y. Emi M. Inoue H. Toge T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 50: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 4Reed J.C. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 314-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It is known that anticancer drugs can induce apoptosis signaling through two major pathways (5Jin Z. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 139-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). One is the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway, and the other is the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway. In the mitochondrial pathway, death signals stimulate mitochondria, resulting in the release of proapoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c, from mitochondria (6Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar). The released cytochrome c, together with Apaf-1, activates caspase-9, which in turn proteolytically activates downstream caspase-3, one of the major caspases participating in the execution phase of apoptosis (6Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar, 7Cain K. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M.

Activated caspase-3 cleaves a lot of substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), 3The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TA, tubocapsenolide A; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethylketone; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; BSO, dl-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Hsp, heat shock protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetylcysteine. 3The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TA, tubocapsenolide A; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethylketone; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; BSO, dl-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Hsp, heat shock protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetylcysteine. a DNA repair enzyme, and leads to inevitable cell death. In the death receptor pathway, upon interaction with its ligand, such as TNF family ligands, death receptors recruit and activate caspase-8 (9Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 can directly activate caspase-3, or it can activate Bid, which then triggers the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (11Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar).Plants are a rich source of unique compounds that induce growth inhibition or apoptosis in premalignant or malignant human cells (12Newman D.J. Cragg G.M. Snader K.M. J. Nat. Prod. 2003; 66: 1022-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar, 13Wu C.C. Chan M.L. Chen W.Y. Tsai C.Y. Chang F.R. Wu Y.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Many compounds used in cancer chemotherapy are derived from plant sources, such as vinca alkaloids, paclitaxel, camptothecin, and etoposide. Withanolides are a group of steroidal lactones found among members of the Solanaceae (14Abou-Douh A.M. Arch. Pharm. 2002; 335: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was reported that withanolides possess anti-tumor, antiangiogenic, anti-invasive, chemopreventive, and anti-inflammatory activities (15Mishra L.C. Singh B.B. Dagenais S. Altern. Med. Rev. 2000; 5: 334-346PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, withanolides may represent useful leads for development of potential anticancer drugs. In our previous study, the methanol extract of Tubocapsicum anomalum (Franchet and Savatier) Makino (Solanaceae), which is a native of Taiwan, exhibited significant cytotoxicity against a panel of cancer cell lines (16Hsieh P.W. Huang Z.Y. Chen J.H. Chang F.R. Wu C.C. Yang Y.L. Chiang M.Y. Yen M.H. Chen S.L. Yen H.F. Lübken T. Hung W.C. Wu Y.C. J. Nat. Prod. 2007; 70: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using bioassay-directed fractionation, 17 withanolides were isolated. Among them, tubocapsenolide A (TA) possessed the most potent activity against the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, the human liver cancer cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B, and the human lung cancer cell line A549, with IC50 values less than 1 μg/ml (16Hsieh P.W.

In the present study, the molecular mechanisms of action of TA were investigated in MDA-MB-231 cells, which are estrogen receptor-negative, p53 mutant, and highly metastatic breast cancer cells (17Runnebaum I.B.

Our results indicate that TA induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in MDA-MB-231 cells, and these effects are related with interference of the chaperone function of heat shock proteins through a thiol oxidation mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDrugs and Chemicals—RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, and streptomycin/penicillin G were obtained from Invitrogen. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) and monochlorobimane were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-caspase 3, anti-caspase 9, anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin E, anti-Cdk4, anti-Cdk2, anti-Raf-1, anti-p21, anti-p27, anti-p53, and anti-PARP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Anti-Akt, anti-p85, and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk), proteasome inhibitor I, MG132 was obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate and Bright Glo luciferase assay reagent were purchased from Promega. DMSO, calpeptin, NH4Cl, N-acetylcysteine, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), propidium iodide, dl-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. TA (Fig. 1A) was isolated from T. anomalum (Franchet and Savatier) Makino by the methods described previously (16Hsieh P.W. Huang Z.Y. Chen J.H. Chang F.R. Wu C.C. Yang Y.L. Chiang M.Y. Yen M.H. Chen S.L. Yen H.F. Lübken T. Hung W.C. Wu Y.C. J. Nat. Prod. 2007; 70: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purity of TA used in our study is over 98% determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. The DMSO stock solution was kept at –20 °C and freshly diluted to the desired concentration with cultured medium immediately before use (the final concentration of DMSO in culture medium was 0.2%).Cell Culture—MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and plated 24 h before treatment with the test drugs.Evaluation of Cell Viability—The cell viability was determined by the MTT assay (19Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45551) Google Scholar). 8 × 103 cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates and treated with the various concentrations of TA for different times as indicated. At the end of each time point, 100 μl of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) were added to each well after removing the growth medium. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, allowing viable cells to reduce the yellow tetrazolium salt into dark blue formazan crystals. At the end of the 1-h incubation, the MTT solution was removed, and 100 μl of DMSO were added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance in individual wells was determined at 550 nm. All of the experiments were plated in triplicate, and the results of assays were presented as means ± S.E. The IC50 data were collected from dose-response data of at least four experiments.Determination of Apoptotic Cells—MDA-MB-231 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded onto 6-well plates and treated with the test drugs for the indicated times. Harvested cells were fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at 4 °C and then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 25 μg/ml RNase and 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min at 4 °C in the dark. The relative DNA content of these cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (EPICS XL-MCL; Beckman Coulter) based on red fluorescence. Ten thousand cells were counted, and the histogram of the cell cycle distribution was analyzed by WinMDI 2.8 software. The percentage of cells with hypodiploid DNA content (sub-G1) represented the fraction undergoing apoptotic DNA fragmentation.Western Blot Assay—Following exposure to various drugs, 3 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with PBS and lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 5,000 units/ml aprotinin). After the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected as the Triton-soluble fraction. The pellet (Triton-insoluble fraction) was lysed in 2% SDS in 50 mm Tris-HCl and boiled for 15 min. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal sample was diluted 1:2 in SDS-sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4‰ bromphenol blue), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and then loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membrane, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Detection was performed using goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).For analysis of disulfide-bonded protein by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, drug-treated cells were washed with PBS at the indicated times and then incubated in ice-cold PBS with 40 mm iodoacetamide (IA) for 5 min to prevent thiol-disulfide exchange and inhibit postlysis oxidation of free cysteines (20Cumming R.C.

Moreover, sample was diluted in SDS-sample buffer without reducing agents before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Detection of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Accumulation—Intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation was monitored using H2DCFDA, which is a relative specific probe for the presence of hydrogen peroxide (21LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). At the end of the treatments, cells were loaded with H2DCFDA (10 μm) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Cells were then collected, washed, and resuspended in PBS and analyzed immediately using flow cytometry with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 530 nm, respectively.Determination of GSH Levels—The levels of GSH were determined as described previously (22Chen W.Y. Wu C.C. Lan Y.H. Chang F.R. Teng C.M. Wu Y.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 522: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After treatments, 1 × 105 cells in 96-well plates were loaded with 100 μm monochlorobimane (Molecular Probes) for 30 min in the dark. Plates were analyzed immediately using a fluorometer (FLX-800) (360-nm excitation filter and 460-nm emission filter).Luciferase Refolding Assay—Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) contains abundant quantities of the heat shock proteins, Hsp90 and Hsp70 (23Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RRL was treated with DMSO or TA for 30 min at 37 °C. Firefly luciferase (Promega) was inactivated for 40 min at 25 °C in denaturation buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 7 m urea). Then inactivated luciferase was diluted 125-fold into refolding buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 17.5 units of creatine phosphocreatine) that was supplemented with or without 50% drug-pretreated RRL and incubated at 25 °C. At the indicated times, 5-μl aliquots were removed from the refolding reaction mixture to a white-walled 96-well plate and mixed with 50 μl of Bright Glo luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was then measured with a luminometer (FLX-800). Native luciferase activity was taken as 100%. The effects of drug treatments on the activity of native luciferase were assayed at 2 h to ensure that TA did not directly inhibit luciferase activity. The chaperone activity of RRL was assayed by measuring luciferase activity following refolding of denatured enzyme (24Srirangam A. Mitr R. Wang M. Gorski J.C. Badve S. Baldridge L. Hamilton J.

A probability of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.RESULTSTA Induces Antiproliferative Effect in MDA-MB-231 Cells—To analyze the cytotoxicity of TA, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with increasing doses of TA (0.03–30 μm) or DMSO (0.2%, vehicle control), and cell viability was determined by a conventional tetrazolium-based (MTT) assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, TA inhibited cell viability of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 value of TA was 2.7 and 1.8 μm at 24 and 48 h after treatment, respectively. Similar to the MTT assay, the data analyzed by the trypan blue exclusion method also showed that TA potently inhibited cell growth and induced cell death (Fig. 1, C and D).TA Induces Caspase-dependent and Caspase-independent Apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 Cells—To clarify whether TA-induced cell death involved apoptosis, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 3 or 6 μm TA for 24 h, and then the ploidy of DNA was determined by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining of nuclei. As shown in Fig. 2A, TA induced a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 population, suggesting that the cells underwent DNA fragmentation, which is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. We next examined the role of caspases in TA-induced apoptosis. Fig. 2B showed that TA induced proteolytic activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In TAtreated cells, cleavages of both procaspase-8 and -9 were significant, observed at 12 h after administration. Caspase-3 is a downstream effector caspase and can be proteolytically activated by both caspase-8 and -9 (26Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 325-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). As expected, TA concentration-dependently induced cleavage of procaspase-3 to an active form (p21/p17). The activation of caspase-3 was further confirmed by the cleavage of PARP, which is a substrate of active caspase-3 (Fig. 2B). When MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm), a pancaspase inhibitor, the low concentration (3 μm) of TA-induced apoptosis was almost completely prevented (Fig. 2A). However, Z-VAD-fmk pretreatment did not prevent apoptosis caused by a higher concentration (6 μm) of TA, despite the fact that TA-induced PARP cleavage was completely prevented by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2C). This finding suggested that caspase activation is not the only mechanism for TA-induced apoptosis and that the caspase-independent pathway also contributes to the TA-induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells.FIGURE 2TA induces caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. A, effect of the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, on TA-induced apoptosis. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) for 1 h before being challenged with TA (3 or 6 μm) for 24 h. The percentage of sub-G1 cells was determined with propidium iodide fluorescence by flow cytometry. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of 4–5 independent experiments. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 as compared with the respective control. B, proteolytic activation of procaspase-8, -9, and -3 and cleavage of PARP. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TA and harvested at 12 or 24 h. Equal amounts of protein (100 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. C, effect of Z-VAD-fmk on TA-induced cleavage of PARP.

Fig. 3 showed that TA-treated cells accumulated in the G1 phase with a concomitant decrease in the S phase of the cell cycle. We next determined the expression of proteins that involved in the G1 phase of cell cycle control and those regulated cell survival by Western blotting. The decreases of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 protein levels and the increase of hypophosphorylated Rb were observed as early as 1 h after the addition of TA (Fig. 4A). Additionally, the protein levels of Raf-1 and Akt, which can cooperate to promote cell cycle progression (28Mirza A.M. Gysin S. Malek N. Nakayama K. Roberts J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10868-10881Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), were also examined. As shown in Fig. 4A, Raf-1 and Akt protein contents were decreased significantly at 3 h and almost depleted at 12 h after TA treatment. Moreover, the induction of p21 and p27, two important Cdk inhibitors, was detectable after 3 and 6 h of TA treatment, respectively (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that TA induced G1 arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells by down-regulation of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 and by induction of Cdk inhibitors.FIGURE 3Effect of TA on cell cycle distribution. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with TA (3–10 μm) for 24 h.

Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar), the lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl (31de Duve C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (32Tsujinaka T. Kajiwara Y. Kambayashi J. Sakon M. Higuchi N. Tanaka T. Mori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (33Fearnhead H.O. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), were employed. All of these inhibitors had no effect on protein expression alone (data not shown). In cells treated with proteasome inhibitors and TA, the Akt protein was lost from the Triton-soluble fraction and accumulated in the Triton-insoluble fraction (Fig. 5). A similar result was observed in Cdk4. In contrast, NH4Cl, calpeptin, and Z-VAD-fmk had little or no effect. These results indicated that TA caused protein aggregation and then induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation.FIGURE 5TA-induced loss of proteins is proteasome-dependent. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitors I (PSI; 10 μm), MG132 (10 μm), calpeptin (40 μm), ammonium chloride (20 mm), or Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) for 1 h, followed by a 6-h exposure to TA (3 μm). Harvested cells were lysed in Triton X-100 buffer, and the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was resolubilized in 2% SDS. Akt and Cdk4 levels were then analyzed by Western blot. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TA-induced Responses Were Associated with Hsp90 Inhibition—Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with TA led to degradation of Akt, Raf-1, cyclin D1, and Cdk4, and all of them are known as client proteins of Hsp90 (34Sreedhar A.S. Soti C. Csermely P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Previously, studies documented that proteasome-mediated degradation is the common fate of Hsp90 client proteins in cells treated with Hsp90 inhibitors (35Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 36Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc.

To confirm this point, the effects of TA on the protein levels of mutant p53, which is also a Hsp90 client protein, and cyclin E, Cdk2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit, which are non-Hsp90-dependent proteins, were examined. As shown in Fig. 6A, TA induced decline of mutant p53, but not cyclin E, Cdk2, and p85, in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results indicated that TA-induced protein degradation was selective for Hsp90 client proteins.FIGURE 6Effects of TA on the expression of non-Hsp90 client proteins (A) and Hsp90 and Hsp70 (B).

https://openalex.org/W2013925827,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress have been considered in a variety of disease models, and cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes have been suggested to be a source of ROS. Induction of P450s by phenobarbital (PB), beta-naphthoflavone (betaNF), or clofibrate in a mouse model increased ROS parameters in the isolated liver microsomes, but isoniazid treatment did not. However, when F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs) were measured in tissues and urine, PB showed the strongest effect and betaNF had a measurable but weaker effect. The same trend was seen when an Nfr2-based transgene reporter sensitive to ROS was analyzed in the mice. This pattern had been seen earlier with F(2)-IsoPs both in vitro and in vivo with rats (Dostalek, M., Brooks, J. D., Hardy, K. D., Milne, G. L., Moore, M. M., Sharma, S., Morrow, J. D., and Guengerich, F. P. (2007) Mol. Pharmacol. 72, 1419-1424). One possibility for the general in vitro-in vivo discrepancy in oxidative stress found in both mice and rats is that PB treatment might attenuate protective systems. One potential candidate suggested by an mRNA microarray was nicotinamide N-methyltransferase. PB was found to elevate nicotinamide N-methyltransferase activity 3- to 4-fold in mice and rats and to attenuate levels of NAD(+), NADP(+), NADH, and NADPH in both species (20-40%), due to the enhanced excretion of (N-methyl)nicotinamide. PB also down-regulated glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, which together constitute a key enzymatic system that uses NADPH in protecting against oxidative stress. These multiple effects on the protective systems are proposed to be more important than P450 induction in oxidative stress and emphasize the importance of studying in vivo models."
https://openalex.org/W2024422292,"Increases in core body temperature promote thermoregulatory cooling by stimulating sweat production and preemptive renal water reabsorption through the release of vasopressin (VP, antidiuretic hormone). The mechanism by which the hypothalamus orchestrates this anticipatory VP release during hyperthermia is unknown but has been linked to a central thermosensory mechanism. Here, we report that thermal stimuli spanning core body temperatures activate a calcium-permeable, ruthenium red- and SB366791-sensitive nonselective cation conductance in hypothalamic VP neurons. This response is associated with a depolarizing receptor potential and an increase in action potential firing rate, indicating that these neurons are intrinsically thermosensitive. The thermosensitivity of VP neurons isolated from trpv1 knockout (Trpv1−/−) mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type counterparts. Moreover, Trpv1−/− mice showed an impaired VP response to hyperthermia in vivo. Channels encoded by the trpv1 gene thus confer thermosensitivity in central VP neurons and contribute to the thermal control of VP release in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2004433270,"The events occurring during tumor formation and progression display similarities to some of the steps in embryonic morphogenesis. The family of AP-2 proteins consists of five different transcription factors (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) that play relevant roles in embryonic development, as demonstrated by the phenotypes of the corresponding knockout mice. Here, we show that AP-2alpha and AP-2gamma proteins play an essential role in tumorigenesis. Down-modulation of AP-2 expression in tumor cells by RNA interference (RNAi) led to enhanced tumor growth and reduced chemotherapy-induced cell death, as well as migration and invasion. Most of these biological modulations were rescued by AP-2 overexpression. We observed that increased xenotransplant growth was mostly due to highly enhanced proliferation of the tumor cells together with reduced innate immune cell recruitment. Moreover, we showed that migration impairment was mediated, at least in part, by secreted factors. To identify the genetic programs involved in tumorigenesis, we performed whole genome microarray analysis of AP-2alpha knockdown cells and observed that AP-2alpha regulates specific genes involved in cell cycle, cell death, adhesion, and migration. In particular, we showed that ESDN, EREG, and CXCL2 play a major role in AP-2 controlled migration, as ablation of any of these genes severely altered migration."
https://openalex.org/W2118413931,"Mutational analysis of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template channel identified two residues, Trp(397) and His(428), which are required for de novo initiation but not for extension from a primer. These two residues interact with the Delta1 loop on the surface of the RdRp. A deletion within the Delta1 loop also resulted in comparable activities. The mutant proteins exhibit increased double-stranded RNA binding compared with the wild type, suggesting that the Delta1 loop serves as a flexible locking mechanism to regulate the conformations needed for de novo initiation and for elongative RNA synthesis. A similar locking motif can be found in other viral RdRps. Products associated with the open conformation of the HCV RdRp were inhibited by interaction with the retinoblastoma protein but not cyclophilin A. Different conformations of the HCV RdRp can thus affect RNA synthesis and interaction with cellular proteins."

Here, we show that spinophilin is a key modulator of opiate action. Knockout of the spinophilin gene causes reduced sensitivity to the analgesic effects of morphine and early development of tolerance but a higher degree of physical dependence and increased sensitivity to the rewarding actions of the drug. At the cellular level, spinophilin associates with the μ opioid receptor (MOR) in striatum and modulates MOR signaling and endocytosis. Activation of MOR by opiate agonists such as fentanyl and morphine promotes these events, which feedback to suppress MOR responsiveness. Our findings support a potent physiological role of spinophilin in regulating MOR function and provide a potential new target for the treatment of opiate addiction.

Growing evidence indicates that the actions of proteins which modulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling are dramatically affected by their binding partners and the multiprotein complexes that they form under specific physiological conditions. Consequently, molecules such as β-arrestin-2 may promote or inhibit receptor signaling depending on other factors (Wang et al., 2004Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J.

Our hypothesis is that repeated opiate exposure leads to adaptations that promote deleterious actions of opiate drugs (craving, dependence, tolerance) by preventing the formation of multiprotein complexes necessary for proper MOR signaling. Therefore, optimizing the action of proteins that are essential for the function of such complexes may delay the progress of addiction.

Since MORs share many of their signal transduction pathways with α2 receptors (i.e., both are Gi linked), it is likely that spinophilin plays a role in MOR signal transduction and desensitization and, consequently, in opiate addiction. Neurabin is a structural analog of spinophilin, with PPI and F-actin binding properties, and a similar pattern of distribution (Burnett et al., 1998Burnett P.E. Blackshaw S. Lai M.M. Qureshi I.A. Burnett A.F. Sabatin D.M. Snyder S.H. Neurabin is a synaptic protein linking p70 S6 kinase and the neuronal cytoskeleton.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27716-27724Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A major difference between the two proteins is that spinophilin contains two PKA phosphorylation sites (Ser-94 and Ser-117) and a receptor binding/interacting domain (aa 169–255) that are absent from neurabin (Allen et al., 1997Allen P.B.

The goal of the present study was to determine the influence of spinophilin on the acute and chronic actions of opiates. We relied on the analysis of spinophilin and neurabin knockout mice (Feng et al., 2000Feng J. Yan Z. Ferreira A. Tomizawa K. Liauw J.A. Zhuo M. Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P.

Snyder G. et al.Distinct roles for spinophilin and neurabin in dopamine mediated plasticity.Neuroscience. 2006; 140: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in a series of behavioral paradigms. We show that spinophilin, but not neurabin, plays a prominent physiological role in regulating behavioral responses to opiates by opposing the development of dependence and tolerance and by decreasing sensitivity to the rewarding actions of the drugs. We also show that spinophilin affects MOR functional responses by promoting endocytosis and by inhibiting MOR signaling. Furthermore, our data indicate that opiate drugs induce association of spinophilin with MOR in striatum by promoting the formation of complexes between spinophilin and GRK2, RGS9-2, and Gβ subunits, signal transduction molecules that are essential for MOR signaling and desensitization. As a first step to investigate the role of spinophilin in physiological responses to opiates, we administered several MOR agonists to mice, at doses which produce maximal analgesic responses in behavioral tests, and monitored spinophilin levels in the nucleus accumbens, the ventral portion of the striatum which is important for many opiate actions. Table 1 shows regulation of spinophilin levels, measured by immunoblotting, in the nucleus accumbens two hrs after administration of different MOR agonists. Spinophilin is downregulated in this brain region by acute morphine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. A similar effect was observed in response to acute administration of other opioid agonists, such as methadone (20 mg/kg, i.p) and fentanyl (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.). Our initial working hypothesis was that downregulation of spinophilin following acute opiate administration is one of the cellular adaptations that contribute to MOR desensitization. Interestingly, exposure to opiates has no effect on neurabin levels and administration of the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine does not affect spinophilin levels in the nucleus accumbens at the 2 hr time point (Table 1). In contrast to the effects of acute morphine exposure, chronic morphine has no effect on spinophilin or neurabin levels in this brain region (not shown). Loss of spinophilin regulation by chronic morphine may be interpreted as one of the adaptive changes that follow continuous morphine use.Table 1Acute Opiate Administration Regulates Spinophilin Levels in Nucleus AccumbensAcute MorphineAcute MethadoneAcute FentanylAcute ClonidineSpinophilin levels (% control)62 ± 8.9∗80.8 ± 3.3∗73 ± 9.5∗109 ± 17Neurabin levels (% control)106 ± 2.8115 ± 9.4111 ± 5.6Decreased levels of spinophilin (but not of neurabin) in the nucleus accumbens of C57Bl/6 mice 2 hr after acute morphine (20 mg/kg), methadone (20 mg/kg), or fentanyl (0.250 mg/kg) administration.

In contrast, clonidine administration had no significant effect on spinophilin levels in this brain region. Data represent % change from saline control and are expressed as means ± SEM, n = 4–5 per group, ∗p < 0.05 from control by t test. To gain insight into the influence of spinophilin on opioid receptor function, we investigated morphine analgesia in the 52°C hot plate assay in mice lacking the spinophilin gene. As shown in Figure 1A, spinophilin mutants are less sensitive to low doses of morphine in this assay compared to their wild-type littermate controls. The spinophilin knockout mice are similarly less sensitive to the analgesic actions of methadone and fentanyl in this assay (Figures 1B and 1C). These findings suggest that spinophilin may be a positive regulator of analgesic responses to opiate drugs. We next tested the effect of spinophilin knockout on analgesic responses to a nonopiate drug, namely, the α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, clonidine. It has been shown previously that spinophilin is a negative modulator of α2-adrenergic receptor responses (Wang et al., 2004Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Spinophilin blocks arrestin actions in vitro and in vivo at G protein-coupled receptors.Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier data, we found that spinophilin mutant mice are more sensitive to the analgesic effects of clonidine (Figure 1D). These findings show that spinophilin modulates analgesic responses in a receptor selective manner: it is a positive modulator of MOR actions, but a negative modulator of α2-adrenergic actions. To assess the role of spinophilin in the development of analgesic tolerance, we used the 52°C hot plate assay and monitored morphine effects once a day for 4 consecutive days. Under these conditions, mice show a gradually reduced response to morphine due to development of tolerance and, by day 4, they show no analgesic response to a constant dose of the drug. Interestingly, spinophilin knockout mice develop maximal tolerance following a single exposure to morphine, as they show no response to the drug by day 2 of the hot plate assay (Figure 1E). To confirm that this is a morphine-related phenotype, we used the same paradigm and administered the α2 adrenergic agonist, clonidine. In contrast to what we observed with morphine, analgesic responses to clonidine (0.4 mg/kg) remained unchanged in both genotypes over 3 days of testing (% MPE for wild-type, day 1 = 25 ± 7, day 2 = 23 ± 3, day 3 = 39 ± 10; %MPE for knockout, day 1 = 58 ± 7, day 2 = 64 ± 3, day 3 = 70 ± 10). Notably, neurabin knockout mice develop tolerance to morphine at the same rate as their wild-type littermate controls (Figure 1F). These latter data show that rapid development of tolerance is not a general feature of depletion of proteins containing PP1 interacting/F-actin binding domains. Furthermore, the facilitated tolerance seen in spinophilin knockout mice does not reflect a general learning phenomenon, since initial analgesic responses are reduced and the mice show no abnormality in the Morris water maze (not shown). In addition to tolerance, chronic exposure to opiates causes severe physical dependence. The role of spinophilin in opiate physical dependence and withdrawal was evaluated using a standard morphine withdrawal paradigm. Mice were treated chronically with increasing doses of morphine, and withdrawal was precipitated by administration of the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (1 mg/kg, s.c.). Several signs of opiate withdrawal were monitored for 25 min after naloxone administration. We found that the intensity of withdrawal is ∼2-fold higher in spinophilin knockout mice compared to their wild-type controls for most of the signs monitored (Figure 2A). In contrast, no significant difference in opiate withdrawal behavior was observed between neurabin knockout and wild-type mice. In fact, for some of the withdrawal signs, there was a trend for milder withdrawal in the neurabin mutants. However, this effect was significant only for weight loss (e.g., jumps for wild-type = 76.2 ± 34, for knockout = 22 ± 14; wet dog shakes for wild-type = 6 ± 2.6, for knockout = 3.6 ± 1.1; diarrhea for wild-type = 9 ± 1, for knockout = 5 ± 1.8; weight loss for wild-type = 3.9 ± 0.54, for knockout = 1.78 ± 0.38∗, n = 7–8 per group, p < 0.05, two way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test). These data suggest that spinophilin plays an important physiological role opposing the development of morphine dependence. We next examined the influence of spinophilin on the rewarding actions of morphine using the place preference paradigm, in which animals learn to prefer an environment paired with drug exposure. In this test, knockout of spinophilin increases the sensitivity of animals to morphine reward (Figure 2B). No differences were observed between neurabin knockout mice and their wild-type controls in this paradigm—place preference scores (in s) for wild-type were as follows: saline = −64 ± 57, morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) = 284 ± 67, morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) = 390 ± 69; knockout were as follows: saline = −68 ± 24, morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) = 240 ± 39, morphine (10mg/kg, i.p.) = 272 ± 37. The opposite phenotype was observed using a model of spinophilin overexpression in the nucleus accumbens. C57Bl/6 mice overexpressing spinophilin in the nucleus accumbens 3 weeks after bilateral stereotaxic injection of an AAV-spinophilin vector (which causes a 78% ± 23% increase in spinophilin protein levels selectively in this brain region determined by immunoblotting), show reduced sensitivity to morphine place conditioning (5 mg/kg, s.c.) compared to AAV-GFP injected control mice (Figure 2C). These data specifically relate the altered behavioral sensitivity to morphine seen in spinophilin knockout mice to the nucleus accumbens per se and argue against the involvement of a developmental abnormality in this phenomenon. Finally, we examined the influence of spinophilin in the locomotor activating effects of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.). In this test, deletion of the spinophilin gene results in increased locomotor responses to acute and repeated morphine administration (Figure 2F). In contrast, viral-mediated overexpression of spinophilin in the nucleus accumbens does not affect the acute locomotor activating effect of morphine but prevents the development of locomotor sensitization to repeated drug exposure (Figure 2E). Deletion of the spinophilin gene does not alter opioid receptor levels in nucleus accumbens, as determined by specific binding of [3H]-DAMGO, a highly selective MOR ligand, in striatal membranes of wild-type and knockout mice: wild-type = 109.15 ± 15 fmols/mg protein, knockout = 99.9 ± 13 fmols/mg protein. In addition, MOR mRNA levels (measured using real time PCR and expressed as fold change over control) in this brain region are unaffected by the loss of spinophilin: wild-type = 1 ± 0.06 and knockout = 0.85 ± 0.26. Likewise, striatal levels of proteins involved in MOR responses, such as RGS9-2, RGS4, β-arrestin-2, and Gβ5, determined by immunoblotting, are also not different in nucleus accumbens between wild-type and knockout mice (not shown). We used coimmunoprecipitation to investigate the effect of opiate drugs on the formation of complexes between spinophilin and MOR in mouse striatum. These studies revealed that under basal conditions MOR is associated with spinophilin and that this association is greatly enhanced 30 min after s.c. administration of the MOR agonists, fentanyl or morphine (Figure 3A). We also found that activation of MOR promotes the association of spinophilin with GRK2 (Figure 3B) and with Gβ5 (Figure 3C). In fact, exposure to opiates promotes the formation of spinophilin complexes with all Gβ subunits in striatum (not shown). As Gβ5 is a binding partner of the striatal-enriched protein RGS9-2, we examined whether RGS9-2 is also coprecipitated with spinophilin after stimulation of MOR. As expected, the spinophilin-RGS9-2 complex is greatly enhanced in striatum following fentanyl or morphine treatment (Figure 3D). We next investigated the effect of loss of spinophilin on signal transduction events that follow activation of MOR. For this purpose, we monitored how the loss of spinophilin affects MOR endocytosis, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and ERK phosphorylation, all three being well-characterized responses to acute MOR activation (Nestler and Aghajanian, 1997Nestler E.J.

We first monitored the effect of morphine on ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cAMP formation in striatum of spinophilin knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. As expected, systemic administration of morphine increases phosphoERK levels in wild-type striatum at 20 min but causes a significantly greater induction of phosphoERK in the absence of spinophilin (250% of saline in striatum of knockout mice versus 150% of saline observed in wild-type controls; Figure 4A). As a control, we monitored phosphoERK levels in striatum from spinophilin wild-type and knockout mice following saline or clonidine (0.4 mg/kg) administration. Contrary to observations with morphine, clonidine had no effect of on ERK phosphorylation in striatum in wild-type (123% ± 20%) or spinophilin knockout (86% ± 11%) mice. In striking contrast to regulation of ERK, spinophilin is required for opioid inhibition of cAMP formation in striatum: the MOR agonist DAMGO reduces cAMP formation in striatal homogenates of wild-type mice, an effect not observed in extracts of knockout mice (Figure 4C). To evaluate the role of spinophilin in MOR endocytosis, we first monitored the rate of MOR internalization following exposure to opiate drugs in the presence or absence of spinophilin in PC12 cells. MOR internalization was quantified using ELISA in PC12 cells transiently transfected with epitope-tagged MOR (HA-MOR), along with a spinophilin plasmid or empty vector. Under control conditions, application of the opioid peptide DAMGO leads to fast internalization of MOR, while morphine application leads to delayed MOR internalization. As shown in Figure 5A, overexpression of spinophilin promotes morphine-induced MOR internalization so that the receptor is internalized within 30 min. Similar results were observed using immunofluorescence to directly visualize HA-MOR in PC12 cells (Figure 5B). We next monitored MOR endocytosis in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from spinophilin wild-type and knockout embryos using ELISA. We used MEF cultures and not cultured striatal neurons, because homozygous spinophilin knockout mice do not breed well and, while we were able to obtain sufficient quantities of MEF cells from embryos of heterozygous crosses, it was not possible to derive sufficient quantities of striatal neurons. MEF cells were infected with a herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector expressing HA-MOR (HSV-HA-MOR) (Haberstock-Debic et al., 2003Haberstock-Debic H. Wein M. Barrot M. Colago E.E. Rahman Z. Neve R.L. Pickel V.M. Nestler E.J. von Zastrow M. Svingos A.L. Morphine acutely regulates opioid receptor trafficking selectively in dendrites of nucleus accumbens neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and drug treatments were applied 24 hr later. Similar to what was observed previously in striatal cultures (Haberstock-Debic et al., 2005Haberstock-Debic H. Kim K. Joy Y.Y. von Zastrow M. Morphine promotes rapid, arrestin-dependent endocytosis of μ-opioid receptors in striatal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7847-7857Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), both morphine and DAMGO induce MOR internalization within 30 min in MEF cells. Interestingly, endocytosis is observed within 30 min in wild-type MEFs, but not in MEFs from spinophilin knockout mice (Figure 5C). In addition, MEF cells from spinophilin wild-type and knockout mice were infected with HSV-HA-MOR, and MOR cellular localization was monitored 24 hr later using immunofluorescence. In wild-type MEFs, MOR is internalized 30 min following morphine treatment (10 μM), however, no internalization is observed in MEFs from spinophilin knockout embryos at this time point (Figure 5D). We also determined the action of spinophilin in MOR endocytosis in wild-type striatal neurons in primary culture. To knock down spinophilin expression in the neurons, we transfected striatal cultures with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against spinophilin or a control siRNA as described by Wang et al., 2004Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Spinophilin blocks arrestin actions in vitro and in vivo at G protein-coupled receptors.Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar. We found that this treatment is effective in reducing spinophilin protein levels by >75% (24 ± 2 of control; Figure 6A) as determined by immunoblot analysis. The cells were then infected with HSV-HA-MOR and 24 hr later, HA-MOR localization was monitored using immunofluorescence. As shown in Figure 6B, under these conditions, administration of 10 μM morphine causes robust MOR internalization at 30 min in control, but internalization is significantly delayed in spinophilin siRNA transfected neurons (mean number of HA-MOR infected cells in which MOR showed intracellular localization at 30 min: control siRNA group = 65.9 ± 6.7, spinophilin siRNA group = 34 ± 1.8). Our study provides evidence for an important physiological role of spinophilin in the regulation of MOR signaling and behavioral responses to opiate drugs of abuse. Deletion of the spinophilin gene causes reduced analgesic effects of acute morphine but enhanced adaptations to repeated morphine exposure, including increased morphine dependence, place conditioning, locomotor sensitization, and analgesic toleranc"

Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical research has established a conceptual framework for DNA damage at the molecular level that includes sensors, transducers, and effectors (2Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). Loss or mutation of DDR genes causes many cancer-prone disorders. Thus, understanding of DDR has a profound impact on mechanisms of cancer development and treatment. In response to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB), the central checkpoint kinase ATM activates the G1, intra-S, and G2/M checkpoints by phosphorylation of downstream effectors. The central theme of DDR is to turn dormant proteins into active effectors to execute the cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis; phosphorylation is a major mechanism for such activation. How constitutively active proteins contribute to checkpoint control is enigmatic. The CK2 kinase is such an example. CK2 has long been implicated in DDR, but its role in regulation of cell cycle checkpoint is not well understood. CK2 is defined as a messenger-independent protein kinase found in complex with two catalytic subunits (α and/or α′) and two regulatory β subunits (3Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). In contrast to ATM, CK2 is an essential and abundant kinase that is constitutively active in the absence of exogenous DNA damage.

Phosphorylation of XRCC1 by CK2 is constitutive and is not stimulated by DNA damage. The failure of the intra-S checkpoint is manifested by the inability of cells to slow down DNA synthesis in response to IR, a phenotype generally referred to as radio-resistant DNA synthesis (RDS). One of the intra-S checkpoint pathways is mediated by Mre11/Rad50/NBS1 (MRN)-SMC1 (16Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Kim S.T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 18Kitagawa R.

SMC1 phosphorylation at Ser-957 and Ser-966 is induced by IR in an ATM- and NBS1-dependent manner, which is important for IR sensitivity and suppression of RDS. SMC1 associates with SMC3, and together with SCC-1/Rad21 and SCC-3 (including SA-1 and SA-2 in human), form the cohesin complex (19Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol.

The cohesin complex is indispensable for many, if not all, aspects of chromosomal metabolism, including sister chromatid cohesion in the S and G2 phase of the cell cycle (21Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K.

Uhlmann F. Nature. 2004; 430: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Since SMC1 is an important effector in the intra S-phase checkpoint pathway, we are interested in whether other cohesion subunits are also involved. We herein report that SMC3 is phosphorylated at Ser-1067 and Ser-1083. Although Ser-1083 phosphorylation is IR-inducible and depends on ATM, Ser-1067 phosphorylation is constitutive and depends on CK2 but is not further enhanced by IR. However, both Ser-1067 phosphorylation and Ser-1083 phosphorylation are required for intra-S phase checkpoint. Furthermore, phosphorylation of SMC3 at Ser-1083 is weakened in cells expressing SMC3-S1067A. Thus, the CK2 kinase may affect IR-induced S-phase checkpoint through SMC3 Ser-1083 phosphorylation. Plasmids, Recombinant Proteins, and Generation of Stable Cell Line—Full-length cDNA encoding wild-type human SMC3 was generated by PCR using a cDNA pool (reverse transcription products from RNA insolated from HeLa S3 cells) as a template. PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to produce C terminus V5 tagged pcDNA-SMC3 plasmid. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to substitute alanine to serine (SMC3-S1067A, SMC3-S1083A) by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting mutant plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid encoding GST-SMC3 (amino acids 881–1218) was cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was expressed and purified according to the standard procedures. Stable cell lines that harbor a “tet-on” promoter to regulate SMC3-WT, SMC3-S1067A, and SMC3-S1083A expression were generated using “Flp-In™ T-Rex™” system (Invitrogen). Two tandem FLAG tags were added to the C terminus of SMC3 to distinguish them from endogenous SMC3 by SDS-PAGE mobility. Forty-eight hours after transfection, hygromycin (200 μg/ml) and blasticidin (10 μg/ml) were added into medium for selection. Single clones were isolated for each SMC3 construct after 3 weeks of selection. FLAG-SMC3 expression was induced by doxycycline at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Clones that express comparable exogenous FLAG-SMC3 were used for functional analysis. SV40 T-antigen immortalized NBS1 fibroblasts were established from an NBS patient (25Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J. Friedl A.A. Klein B. Verhaegh G.W. Jaspers N.G. Midro A.T. Eckardt-Schupp F. Lohman P.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mutat Res. 1999; 434: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NBS1-LBI cell lines with retroviral expression of NBS1-WT were produced as described (16Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Antibodies, in Vitro Kinase Assay and Transfections—Human cervical cancer cell line HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney cell line 293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rabbit polyclonal SMC3, V5, CK2α, CK2α′, and pS1083-SMC3 phospho-antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories. ATM and NBS1 antibodies were from GeneTex (San Antonio, TX). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out as described (26Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were carried out as described (27Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Small interference RNA (siRNA) for ATM, CK2α, CK2α′, and Vimentin were purchased from Dharmacon Research as SMARTPOOLs. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs by Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were treated with IR and recovered for 1 h or for the indicated times before harvest. Transient transfection of plasmids encoding SMC3 and ATM was carried out in 293T cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and calcium phosphate, respectively. Forty to sixty hours after transfection, cells were treated with IR and recovered for 1 h before harvest. RDS Assay—RDS assay was carried out as described (16Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T stable cell lines expressing WT, S1067A, and S1083A SMC3 were labeled with 10 nCi/ml of [14C]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 36 h to normalize the total amount of DNA among different samples. Cells were irradiated with 10 Gy of IR and recovered for 1 h. They were then pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min, washed with PBS, fixed with methanol, and lysed with 0.5 m NaOH. The lysates were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Radio-resistant DNA synthesis was calculated using the ratio of radioactivity of 3H/14C. Overlapping 3H and 14C emissions were corrected with quenched 3H and 14C standards. Five replicas were measured for each sample. Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Using Mass Spectrometry—Identification of phosphorylation sites with mass spectrometry was carried out as described previously with minor modifications (28Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both a MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption) linear ion trap mass spectrometer (vMALDI-LTQ, Thermal Finnigan, San Jose, CA) and a capillary HPLC (75-μm ID column)-electrospray linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Proteomix, Thermal Finnigan) were used. The cohesin complex was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against SMC1 or SMC3 from nuclear extract made from HeLa S3 cells 2 h after 20 Gy of γ-irradiation and resolved in a 4–20% SDS-PAGE. Trypsin digests of SMC1, SMC3, and SCC3 (they co-migrate on the SDS-PAGE gel), and SCC1 bands were subject to mass spectrometric analysis to identify phosphorylation sites as described previously (28Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Mapping SMC3 Phosphorylation Sites—We used mass spectrometry to analyze phosphorylation of the cohesin complex, which includes SMC1, SMC3, SCC-1, and SCC-3 (including SA-1 and SA-2), in cycling and IR-treated cells. The cohesin complex was immunoprecipitated with SMC1 antibody from HeLa cells treated with 20 Gy of IR and recovered for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Tryptic peptides resulting from in-gel digestion of the individual cohesin subunit were exhaustively analyzed with mass spectrometry. To achieve a more thorough analysis, we used both MALDI-linear ion trap mass spectrometry (vMALDI-LTQ) and capillary HPLC-electrospray-linear ion trap mass spectrometry. In addition to the previously reported Ser-957 and Ser-966 of SMC1, Ser-1067 and Ser-1083 of SMC3 were also phosphorylated (Fig. 1, A and B). We raised a phospho-specific antibody against pS1083 of SMC3. As shown in Fig. 2A, this antibody specifically recognized phosphorylated SMC3 at Ser-1083 as the S1083A mutation abolished the Western blot signal. Using this antibody, we confirmed that endogenous SMC3 Ser-1083 phosphorylation is induced by IR (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2SMC3 is phosphorylated at Ser-1067 and Ser-1083 in cycling and IR-treated cells. A, characterization of pS1083-SMC3 phospho-specific antibody. V5-SMC3-WT and V5-SMC3-S1083A were transfected in 293T cells, and cells were irradiated with 10 Gy IR. SMC3 was immunoprecipitated (IP) with a V5 antibody and Western blotted with pS1083-SMC3 antibody. B, phosphorylation of the endogenous SMC3 at Ser-1083. HeLa cells were irradiated with 10 Gy of IR and allowed to recover for 1 h. Whole cell lysates were Western blotted with antibodies against pS1083-SMC3 and SMC3. C, quantitative mass spectrometric measurement of Ser-1067 and Ser-1083 phosphorylation induction in response to IR. HeLa cells were labeled with light or heavy isotope and treated with or without IR, respectively. Equal amounts of two isotope-labeled cells were mixed for the subsequent processing. Phosphorylation of Ser-1067 and Ser-1083 in light labeled SMC3 (IR-treated) are normalized to those in heavy labeled SMC3 (untreated) to calculate phosphorylation induced by IR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We noticed in the mass spectrometry measurement that in contrast to that of Ser-1083, the intensity of the phospho-peptide containing Ser-1067 did not change in response to IR. Since we failed to obtain the phospho-specific antibody against pS1067, we carried out quantitative mass spectrometry using stable isotope-labeled amino acids in cultured cells (29Ong S.E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar) to determine whether phosphorylation of Ser-1067 is IR-inducible (supplemental Fig. 1). Cells were grown in culture medium that contain “light” or “heavy” isotope-labeled Arg and Lys (resulting in mass increases of 10 and 6 Da for Arg- and Lys-containing peptides, respectively). Light isotope-labeled cells were treated with IR, whereas heavy isotope-labeled cells were not treated. They were mixed and then underwent identical manipulation during cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and MS analysis. Peptides labeled with isotopes are chemically identical but distinguished by mass difference so that their mass spectrometric intensities can be directly compared, and when normalized to an unmodified peptide of different sequence (serving as a loading control), the ratio of induction can be measured. Such a quantitative measurement showed that phosphorylation of Ser-1067 did not increase significantly (∼10%) after IR, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-1083 increases by nearly 20-fold (Fig. 2C). We concluded that Ser-1067 is constitutively phosphorylated and is not further induced by IR. Ser-1083 Phosphorylation Depends on ATM and NBS1—Since Ser-1083 conforms to ATM phosphorylation consensus (30Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and its phosphorylation is IR-inducible, we tested whether phosphorylation of Ser-1083 depends on ATM. Knockdown ATM by siRNA significantly reduced Ser-1083 phosphorylation, indicating that Ser-1083 phosphorylation depends on ATM in vivo (Fig. 3A). A similar dependence on ATM was obtained in an immortalized A-T fibroblast cell line that was stably transfected with either a vector (AT22IJE-T) or a fulllength ATM cDNA (pEBS7-YZ5), which has partially restored ATM function (data not shown). Next, we examined the dependence of SMC3 phosphorylation on NBS1. When compared with the vector-transfected NBS cell line (NBS-Lbi), stable expression of WT-NBS1 rescues Ser-1083 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Thus, Ser-1083 phosphorylation appears to be downstream in the ATM-MRN pathway. To determine whether ATM can phosphorylate SMC3 in vitro, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated ATM expressed in 293T cells and a GST-SMC3 fragment encompassing amino acids 881–1218 expressed in Escherichia coli. As shown in Fig. 3C, WT ATM, but not kinase-dead ATM, phosphorylates the SMC3, demonstrating that ATM is capable of phosphorylating SMC3 in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that ATM phosphorylates Ser-1083 of SMC3 both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of Ser-1083, as Well as Ser-1067 of SMC3, Is Required for Intra S-phase Checkpoint—We tested whether SMC3 phosphorylation is required for intra-S phase checkpoint. We transiently expressed V5-SMC3 proteins, including WT, S1067A, S1083A, or S1067A/S1083A mutants in 293T cells, and measured RDS. Because phosphorylation of Ser-1067 is not IR-induced, we expected that it would not regulate the intra-S phase checkpoint. Thus, the S1067A mutant was used as a negative control to demonstrate that not all phosphorylation sites regulate intra-S phase checkpoint. As expected, DNA synthesis in cells expressing SMC3-WT was decreased to 55% of that in cycling cells after IR; cells expressing SMC3-S1083A exhibited RDS phenotype, in which the DNA synthesis rate is 64% of that in cycling cells. Unexpectedly, cells expressing the SMC3-S1067A mutant also displayed RDS despite the fact that phosphorylation of Ser-1067 is not IR-induced. Cells expressing SMC3-S1067A/S1083A double mutant also showed RDS (Fig. 4A). The RDS level of cells expressing SMC3 mutants is similar to that of positive control cells that expressed kinase-dead ATM. These data suggest that phosphorylation of both Ser-1067 and Ser-1083 is required for intra-S phase checkpoint activation. To confirm this conclusion, we established stable cell lines that harbor a tet-on promoter to induce FLAG-tagged SMC3-WT, SMC3-S1067A, and SMC3-S1083A expression in 293T cells. Comparable levels of SMC3-WT and mutants are expressed as early as 24 h after the addition of doxycycline (Fig. 4B), and the induced SMC3 protein is incorporated into the cohesin complex as FLAG-SMC3 can be co-precipitated with endogenous SMC1 and RAD21 (data not shown). Consistent with data from the transient transfection experiment, small but reproducible RDS was observed in the S1067A-expressing cell line. Although DNA synthesis in cells expressing SMC3-WT was decreased to 65% of that in cycling cells after IR (Fig. 4B), it is decreased to 72 and 78% in cells expressing SMC3-S1067A and SMC3-S1083A, respectively (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-1083 is required for intra-S phase checkpoint and that Ser-1067 phosphorylation also affects intra-S phase checkpoint, although its phosphorylation is not IR-induced. Constitutive Phosphorylation of Ser-1067 Facilitates IR-induced Phosphorylation of Ser-1083—Next, we investigated how a constitutive phosphorylation affects IR-induced intra-S phase checkpoint. Because of the proximity of Ser-1067 and Ser-1083, we hypothesize that Ser-1067 phosphorylation may influence Ser-1083 phosphorylation. We compared phosphorylation of Ser-1083 in the stable cell lines that express FLAG-SMC3-WT or -S1067A mutant. FLAG-SMC3 proteins were immunoprecipitated by FLAG antibody, and Ser-1083 phosphorylation was detected by the phospho-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C, phosphorylation of Ser-1083 in FLAG-SMC3-S1067A cells is significantly lower than that in FLAG-SMC3-WT during the time course between 10 min to 2 h in response to 5 Gy of IR. These results suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-1067 may affect intra-S phase checkpoint through modulating Ser-1083 phosphorylation by ATM. CK2 Phosphorylates Ser-1067 and Promotes Ser-1083 Phosphorylation and Intra-S phase Checkpoint Activation—Inspection of the SMC3 protein sequence revealed that Ser-1067 (1067SQDE1070) conforms to a CK2 phosphorylation consensus site. CK2 has been implicated in DNA damage response, but its role in intra-S phase checkpoint activation is not clear. We tested whether CK2 is required for Ser-1067 phosphorylation and intra-S phase checkpoint. We inactivated CK2 by siRNA knockdown of both catalytic subunits CK2α and CK2α′ (Fig. 5A), a condition known to attenuate its activity (7Luo H. Chan D.W. Yang T. Rodriguez M. Chen B.P. Leng M. Mu J.J. Chen D. Songyang Z. Wang Y. Qin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8356-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Quantitative mass spectrometric analysis showed that the Ser-1067 phosphorylation dropped to 20% in CK2 knockdown cells when compared with that in control cells (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that CK2 is required for constitutive phosphorylation of SMC3 at Ser-1067. We used stable isotope-labeled amino acids in cultured cells coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry to measure Ser-1083 phosphorylation in CK2 knockdown cells. Consistent with the observation that S1067A impairs Ser-1083 phosphorylation in response to IR, CK2 knockdown also impairs the ability of Ser-1083 phosphorylation to be induced by IR (Fig. 5C). Although 10 Gy of IR induces an ∼17-fold increase in control knockdown cells, it induces only an ∼4-fold increase of Ser-1083 phosphorylation when CK2 is knocked down (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that CK2 is responsible for constitutive phosphorylation of Ser-1067 and promotes IR-induced Ser-1083 phosphorylation. To determine whether CK2 also regulates intra-S phase checkpoint, we measured RDS in CK2 knockdown cells. As expected, the extent of DNA synthesis inhibition is consistently less in siCK2-transfected cells than in control siRNA-transfected cells during the 2-h period after IR (Fig. 5D), suggesting that CK2 is required for intra-S phase checkpoint activation. We report the identification of two in vivo phosphorylation sites at Ser-1067 and Ser-1083 of SMC3, a core component of the cohesin complex. Using quantitative mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibody, we show that Ser-1083 is an ATM site both in vitro and in vivo and is required for intra-S phase checkpoint activation. Ser-1067 is constitutively phosphorylated and is not IR-inducible but also modulates intra-S phase checkpoint. Thus, there appears to be interplay between the two phosphorylation sites in that constitutive Ser-1067 phosphorylation promotes IR-induced Ser-1083 phosphorylation, providing an explanation for how a constitutive phosphorylation event regulates DNA damage checkpoint. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a phosphorylation site that is not IR-induced yet plays a role in DNA damage checkpoint. This example provides a cautionary note for the notion that phosphorylation sites, if they are not IR-induced, are not important for DNA damage checkpoints. We also identified CK2 as the kinase that phosphorylates Ser-1067 and found that CK2 is required for suppression of RDS, thus linking CK2 to intra-S phase checkpoint through regulation of Ser-1083 phosphorylation. However, the molecular mechanism by which phosphorylated Ser-1067 regulates Ser-1083 phosphorylation remains unclear. The Cohesin Complex as a Target of the Intra-S Phase Checkpoint—We and others previously discovered that SMC1 phosphorylation is an important event in the ATM-NBS1-mediated pathway (16Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Kim S.T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Now our data show that SMC3 is also phosphorylated in response to IR and that its phosphorylation is important for suppression of RDS. SMC1 and SMC3 constitute the core of the cohesin complex. Each SMC subunit is self-folded by antiparallel coiled-coil interaction, creating a rod-shaped molecule with a hinge domain at one end and an ATPase head and tail domain at the other end (31Losada A. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1269-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). SMC1 and SMC3 bind to each other tightly through their hinge domains and bind another cohesin component, SCC1, through their head domains to form a ring-like structure that has been proposed to encircle the sister chromatids for establishing and maintaining sister chromatid cohesion (32Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Why does the intra-S phase checkpoint target the cohesion complex? We do not know the answer until we identify the downstream targets of SMC phosphorylation. Could the cohesin complex be the elusive intra-S phase checkpoint target that regulates the DNA replication machinery? Cohesion is established in S-phase and is coupled to DNA synthesis (33Tanaka K. Yonekawa T. Kawasaki Y. Kai M. Furuya K. Iwasaki M. Murakami H. Yanagida M. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, cohesion is proximal to the DNA replication machinery. The formation of the ring-like cohesion structure on chromatin is mediated by ATP hydrolysis (34Weitzer S. Lehane C. Uhlmann F. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1930-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). SMC ATPase head and tail domain and its flanking coiled-coil region play an important role in cohesion formation. Since Ser-957 and Ser-966 of SMC1 and Ser-1067 and Ser-1083 of SMC3 are located in this region, it is conceivable that phosphorylation of SMC1 and SMC3 may modulate SMC ATPase function to facilitate the slowdown of DNA synthesis when DSB is encountered. Such a model awaits the development of an in vitro ATPase activity assay for the cohesin complex to be tested. Currently, the cohesin complex exhibits very weak ATPase activity with the available in vitro assay (35Gruber S. Arumugam P. Katou Y. Kuglitsch D. Helmhart W. Shirahige K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2006; 127: 523-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cohesion is also essential for homologous recombination repair of DSB because the damaged sister chromatid and repair template must be in close proximity (22Strom L. Lindroos H.B. Shirahige K. Sjogren C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1003-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 36Schar P. Fasi M. Jessberger R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3921-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two recent publications reported that in response to a DSB in budding yeast, cohesion is formed de novo near the DSB by loading newly formed cohesin complex that is different from the S-phase cohesin (22Strom L. Lindroos H.B. Shirahige K. Sjogren C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1003-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 37Unal E. Arbel-Eden A. Sattler U. Shroff R. Lichten M. Haber J.E. Koshland D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 991-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Such an event also depends on the MRN complex (37Unal E. Arbel-Eden A. Sattler U. Shroff R. Lichten M. Haber J.E. Koshland D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 991-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), an important regulator of the intra-S phase checkpoint pathway mediated by ATM/SMC. An interesting question is whether SMC phosphorylation regulates de novo cohesion formation in response to DNA damage and whether de novo cohesion formation is required for intra S phase checkpoint activation. The cohesion formed de novo must be involved in the homologous recombination events dealing with DSB, including DSB repair. It has been established that SMC1 phosphorylation is essential for survival in response to IR in a mouse knock-in model (18Kitagawa R. Bakkenist C.J. McKinnon P.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1423-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), which makes SMC1 phosphorylation, and possibly SMC3 phosphorylation, the only intra-S phase checkpoint-regulated phosphorylation that is required for both IR survival and checkpoint activation. Note that even NBS1 phosphorylation, an upstream element of the intra-S phase checkpoint pathway, is not required for IR survival, although it is essential for checkpoint. We propose that SMC1 and SMC3 phosphorylation is at the crossroad of checkpoint activation and homologous recombination repair of DSB. Regulation of Intra-S Phase Checkpoint by the CK2 Kinase—A surprising finding of the present work is that the CK2 kinase regulates intra-S phase checkpoint by constitutive phosphorylation of SMC3 at Ser-1067. A role of CK2 in DNA damage response was implicated in many previous works. We show here that CK2 knockdown cells as well as cells overexpressing SMC3-1067A mutant exhibit the RDS phenotype and weakened Ser-1083 phosphorylation. Together these results support the notion that the CK2 kinase is an intra-S phase checkpoint protein and suggest that one possible mechanism for its action is through modulating Ser-1083 phosphorylation. We do not have sufficient data to explain how phosphorylation of Ser-1067 “primes” the phosphorylation of Ser-1083, but we provide two highly speculative models. First, phosphorylation of Ser-1067 may create a binding site to recruit a DDR protein to facilitate SMC3 phosphorylation. Coincidentally, CK2 phosphorylation creates a binding consensus for the FHA domain (7Luo H. Chan D.W. Yang T. Rodriguez M. Chen B.P. Leng M. Mu J.J. Chen D. Songyang Z. Wang Y. Qin J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8356-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a phosphor-peptide binding domain that is important in DNA damage response. Notably, the NBS1 protein contains an FHA domain, which may be recruited to SMC3 by binding to phosphorylated Ser-1067 and facilitates the phosphorylation of SMC3 at Ser-1083 by ATM. The weakened Ser-1083 phosphorylation in NBS cells is consistent with this hypothesis. However, we could not detect such an interaction with biochemical means, probably because such interaction is too transient to be detected. An in vivo phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interaction assay may provide a better approach to address this issue (38Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Second, Ser-1067 phosphorylation of SMC3 may mark a special region of the chromatin that must be dealt with in response to DNA damage so that the nearby Ser-1083 is phosphorylated to activate the checkpoint. An intriguing possibility is that Ser-1067 phosphorylation marks the chromatin that is surrounded by DNA replication late origins. We speculate that creation of the Ser-1067 phosphorylation is coupled with replication origin licensing and DNA replication. Thus, chromatins surrounding all specified DNA replication origins may initially be marked with Ser-1067 phosphorylated SMC3 during replication origin licensing; after firing of the early origins, the protein phosphatase associated with DNA replication machinery (39Lin X.H.

A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) removes the phosphorylation mark, leaving the late origins untouched. Such a model can be tested with genome-wide tiling array once a chromatin immunoprecipitation grade Ser-1067 phosphorylation-specific antibody becomes available and will be a direction to pursue in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2009641658,"Myosin V is a processive actin-based motor protein that takes multiple 36-nm steps to deliver intracellular cargo to its destination. In the laser trap, applied load slows myosin V heavy meromyosin stepping and increases the probability of backsteps. In the presence of 40 mm phosphate (P(i)), both forward and backward steps become less load-dependent. From these data, we infer that P(i) release commits myosin V to undergo a highly load-dependent transition from a state in which ADP is bound to both heads and its lead head trapped in a pre-powerstroke conformation. Increasing the residence time in this state by applying load increases the probability of backstepping or detachment. The kinetics of detachment indicate that myosin V can detach from actin at two distinct points in the cycle, one of which is turned off by the presence of P(i). We propose a branched kinetic model to explain these data. Our model includes P(i) release prior to the most load-dependent step in the cycle, implying that P(i) release and load both act as checkpoints that control the flux through two parallel pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1975295763,"Neural activity in the frontal eye fields controls smooth pursuit eye movements, but the relationship between single neuron responses, cortical population responses, and eye movements is not well understood. We describe an approach to dynamically link trial-to-trial fluctuations in neural responses to parallel variations in pursuit and demonstrate that individual neurons predict eye velocity fluctuations at particular moments during the course of behavior, while the population of neurons collectively tiles the entire duration of the movement. The analysis also reveals the strength of correlations in the eye movement predictions derived from pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons and suggests a simple model of cortical processing. These findings constrain the primate cortical code for movement, suggesting that either a few neurons are sufficient to drive pursuit at any given time or that many neurons operate collectively at each moment with remarkably little variation added to motor command signals downstream from the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2034745548,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genome instability syndrome that is characterized by progressive bone marrow failure and a high risk of cancer. FA patients are particularly susceptible to leukemia as well as squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the head and neck, anogenital region and skin. Thirteen complementation groups and the corresponding FA genes have been identified, and their protein products assemble into nuclear core complexes during DNA-damage responses. Much progress has been made in our understanding of post-translational FA protein modifications and physical interactions. By contrast, little is known about the control of protein availability at the level of transcription. We report here that multiple FA proteins were downregulated during the proliferative arrest of primary human keratinocytes and HeLa cells, and that the observed regulation was at a transcriptional level. Proliferative stimuli such as expression of HPV16 E7 as well as E2F1 overexpression in primary cells resulted in coordinate FA upregulation. To define the underlying mechanism, we examined the endogenous FANCD2 promoter, and detected regulated binding of members of the E2F/Rb family in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, a 1 kb promoter fragment was sufficient to confer E2F/Rb regulation in reporter assays. Taken together, our data demonstrate FA gene co-regulation in synchrony with the cell cycle and suggest that deregulated expression of individual FA genes—in addition to FA gene mutation—may promote FA-related human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2087191213,"Recently, the bacterial elongation factor LepA was identified as critical for the accuracy of in vitro translation reactions. Extremely well conserved homologues of LepA are present throughout bacteria and eukaryotes, but the physiological relevance of these proteins is unclear. Here we show that the yeast counterpart of LepA, Guf1, is located in the mitochondrial matrix and tightly associated with the inner membrane. It binds to mitochondrial ribosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. Mutants lacking Guf1 show cold- and heat-sensitive growth defects on non-fermentable carbon sources that are especially pronounced under nutrient-limiting conditions. The cold sensitivity is explained by diminished rates of protein synthesis at low temperatures. At elevated temperatures, Guf1-deficient mutants exhibit defects in the assembly of cytochrome oxidase, suggesting that the polypeptides produced are not functional. Moreover, Guf1 mutants exhibit synthetic growth defects with mutations of the protein insertase Oxa1. These observations show a critical role for Guf1 in vivo. The observed defects in Guf1-deficient mitochondria are consistent with a function of Guf1 as a fidelity factor of mitochondrial protein synthesis.

The observed defects in Guf1-deficient mitochondria are consistent with a function of Guf1 as a fidelity factor of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Cells of animals and fungi contain two translation machineries, one in the cytosol and one in the mitochondrial matrix. Whereas the cytosolic machinery synthesizes thousands of different polypeptides, the mitochondrial one produces only a handful of translation products. In most animal cells, including humans, 13 different proteins are synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes; in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae only eight proteins are mitochondrially encoded (1Borst P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1977; 2: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These translation products constitute the membrane-embedded cores of the respiratory chain complexes and the FoF1-ATPase and hence are essential for respiratory activity of eukaryotic cells. Despite this extreme discrepancy in their number of products, both machineries are similarly complex. The number of proteins that constitute the mitochondrial ribosome even exceeds the number of the cytosolic 80 S ribosome (2O'Brien T.W. Gene. 2002; 286: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Sharma M.R. Koc E.C. Datta P.P. Booth T.M. Spremulli L.L. Agrawal R.K. Cell. 2003; 115: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Many factors were identified over the last decades that assist or coordinate mitochondrial protein synthesis. Little is known on the specific molecular function of most of these components. In contrast to other translation machineries, that of mitochondria is intimately coupled to the inner membrane, which might explain why a membrane-free in vitro translation system with mitochondrial ribosomes could not be established thus far (4Dekker P.J. Papadopoulou B. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M.

The translation machinery of mitochondria resembles that of eubacteria in a number of respects. The mitochondrial ribosome consists of two RNA subunits and ∼70–80 different proteins. The rRNAs are related to the bacterial counterparts 16 S and 23 S, and more than half of the protein components of the mitochondrial ribosome have homologues in bacteria (9Koc E.C. Burkhart W.

Elongation of translation is energetically driven by three GTPases, Mef1, Mef2, and Tuf1 (11Vambutas A. Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Nagata S. Tsunetsugu-Yokota Y. Naito A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tuf1 is the homologue of EF-Tu, 2The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; HA, hemagglutinin. which delivers the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome. Mef1 and Mef2 are related to the bacterial elongation factor G (EF-G), which transfers peptidyl-tRNAs from the A to the P site of the ribosome. In S. cerevisiae mitochondria, a homologue of the nucleotide-exchange factor EF-Ts is missing. Besides EF-G and EF-Tu, bacteria contain a third highly conserved GTPase, named LepA, that is proposed to be involved in translational elongation (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16March P.E. Mol.

In contrast to the other elongation factors, LepA is not essential and the deletion of LepA causes no obvious growth defects (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Dibb N.J. Wolfe P.B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 83-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of LepA remained unclear for a long time. In a recent study it was shown that in vitro LepA stimulates the back-translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA and thereby antagonizes the function of EF-G (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing amounts of LepA reduced the error rate of in vitro protein synthesis assays, suggesting that LepA plays a role as a fidelity factor of the translation reaction. In Escherichia coli the gene of LepA is located on the same operon as that of leader peptidase. This, and the fact that LepA was reported to be membrane-associated in bacteria, suggested a role of LepA in the synthesis of membrane proteins (17March P.E. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7500-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence for such a function in membrane protein biogenesis does, however, not exist. LepA contains close homologues in eukaryotes, where they are named Guf1 for GTPase of unknown function 1 (20Kiser G.L. Weinert T.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although these proteins were identified several years ago, their physiological role stayed elusive. Our results show that LepA/ Guf1 plays a critical function in vivo. We present evidence that Guf1 is a mitochondrial protein that, like LepA, interacts with translating ribosomes. Mutants lacking Guf1 show reduced translation rates only at low temperature. However, Guf1 becomes important under nutrient-limiting conditions. In mitochondria of starving Guf1 deletion mutants, the rate of protein synthesis is not decreased, but only very low steady state levels of cytochrome oxidase are found. This points to a role, direct or indirect, of Guf1 in the assembly or stability of mitochondrial translation products. Such a role might be the prevention of errors of the translation reaction or the coordination of synthesis and folding of newly synthesized translation products. Yeast Strains and Growth Medium—The wild type strain W303-1A (21Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) was used for all biochemical experiments. For growth experiments shown in Fig. 5, strains isogenic to the wild type BY4742 (22Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2643) Google Scholar) were used. For generation of the Guf1-HA mutant, a sequence encoding three hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes and a TRP1 marker gene was amplified from the pYM22 plasmid (23Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A. Doenges G. Schwob E. Schiebel E. Knop M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar) and inserted after the chromosomal GUF1 gene, resulting in the expression of the entire Guf1 protein carrying three HA epitopes at its C terminus. Yeast cultures were grown at 15, 30, or 37 °C in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone (YP) medium supplemented with 2, 0.5, or 0.1% glucose, glycerol, or galactose. Ribosomal Isolation—500 μg of isolated mitochondria were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mix (Calbiochem) in the presence of 1 mm GTPγS and 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GDP and 5 m m MgCl2, or 5 mm EDTA for 15 min at 4 °C. After a clarifying spin for 5 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, the extracts were layered onto continuous 4 ml of 10–30% sucrose and centrifuged for 80 min at 485,000 × g in a Beckman SW60 Ti rotor at 4 °C. Fractions were collected, and proteins were precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid. Miscellaneous—The following procedures were carried out as described: isolation of mitochondria, import of radiolabeled proteins into mitochondria and labeling of translation products, isolation of ribosomes and mitochondrial subfractionation (24Ott M. Prestele M. Bauerschmitt H. Funes S. Bonnefoy N. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Meier S. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Biol.

Herrmann J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and determination of enzymatic activities (27Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Guf1 Is the Eukaryotic Homologue of LepA—The LepA protein of E. coli was recently identified as a highly conserved GTPase involved in translational elongation (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Homologues of LepA are conserved throughout bacteria and eukaryotes (where they are referred to as Guf1) but absent from archaea (28Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Margus T. Remm M. Tenson T. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The LepA/Guf1 family members of bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals form a separate sub-branch on the phylogenetic tree of GTPases that is distinct from the sub-branches of the elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu (Fig. 1A). This suggests a common origin of pro- and eukaryotic LepA/Guf1 proteins after which these factors were maintained throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. This evolutionary conservation is further supported by the high degree of structural identity of Guf1 proteins with LepA. In bacteria, LepA is one of the proteins with the highest degree of sequence identity (66–93%), and only EF-Tu is even more conserved (28Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The E. coli protein was reported to form five structural domains (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that are all present in a consistent order in the Guf1 homologues of plants, fungi, and animals (Fig. 1B). Each of these domains shows a very high degree of identity to those of the LepA protein of E. coli, in the range of 35 to 65% (Fig. 1B). Their outstanding conservation throughout evolution suggests that LepA/Guf1 homologues exhibit a critical conserved function in pro- and eukaryotes. Guf1 Is Located in the Mitochondrial Matrix—While prokaryotic LepA and eukaryotic Guf1 proteins are highly conserved, the eukaryotic proteins consistently show N-terminal extensions that are absent in LepA proteins (Fig. 1B, Pre). These sequences show the characteristics of mitochondrial targeting signals. In a genome-wide screen a fusion protein of Guf1 and green fluorescent protein was localized to mitochondria (30Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar). To confirm the mitochondrial location of Guf1, a yeast strain was generated that expresses Guf1 with a C-terminal HA epitope tag under control of the endogenous promoter. Upon subfractionation of cells, this Guf1-HA protein was specifically recovered with mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Guf1-HA was resistant against protease in mitochondria and in mitoplasts in which the outer membrane was disrupted by hypotonic swelling but degraded after lysis of the mitochondrial membranes by detergent (Fig. 2B). This indicates that Guf1 is located in the mitochondrial matrix and does not expose any domains into the intermembrane space. Although the Guf1 sequence does not show any hydrophobic region that would serve as a membrane anchor, Guf1-HA was exclusively found in the membrane fraction upon extraction of proteins from mitochondria with urea (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). Even upon the stringent extraction with unbuffered carbonate, a large fraction of Guf1-HA remained associated with membranes (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). The mitochondrial localization of Guf1 was further supported by in vitro import experiments that showed that a radiolabeled precursor form of Guf1 can be efficiently imported into isolated yeast mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S1). In summary, we conclude that Guf1 is a matrix protein that is tightly associated with the inner membrane of mitochondria. Guf1 Binds to Mitochondrial Ribosomes in a GTP-dependent Manner—The close sequence relationship of Guf1 to LepA of E. coli and other GTP-regulated elongation factors inspired us to assess whether Guf1 interacts with mitochondrial ribosomes. To this end, mitochondria were isolated from Guf1-HA cells and incubated under conditions that promote active protein synthesis. Mitochondrial translation was monitored by the incorporation of [35S]methionine into newly synthesized polypeptides. After 10 min mitochondria were reisolated, split into three samples, and further incubated in the presence of (i) GTP and ATP, (ii) GDP, and (iii) the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS. Subsequently, the samples were lysed and ribosomes were isolated by centrifugation through high sucrose cushions (Fig. 3A). In the ribosomal pellet fraction (Fig. 3A, P), proteins of the large (Mrpl36) and small (Mrps51) ribosomal subunits were recovered as well as nascent chains in the autoradiogram. Soluble proteins (Fig. 3A, Hep1) and completed translation products were found in the supernatant (S). In the presence of ATP and GTP, about half of the Guf1-HA was found to be associated with ribosomes (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). In the presence of GDP, Guf1 was exclusively recovered with the post-ribosomal supernatant (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6) whereas GTPγS stabilized Guf1 on the ribosomes (lanes 7–9). The ribosomal association of Guf1 was further supported by velocity centrifugation of mitochondrial ribosomes on linear sucrose gradients (Fig. 3B). In the presence of GTPγS, but not in the presence of GDP or EDTA, a fraction of Guf1 comigrated with proteins of the large and small subunits of ribosomes. The much longer migration distance of the ribosomes in these gradients led obviously to some dissociation of Guf1 even in the presence of GTPγS. In summary, we conclude that Guf1 binds to mitochondrial ribosomes in a GTP-dependent manner, consistent with a direct role of Guf1 in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Guf1 Promotes Mitochondrial Protein Synthesis at Low Temperature—To assess a function of Guf1 in mitochondrial protein synthesis, we purified mitochondria from wild type and Δguf1 cells. Mitochondria were incubated in translation reactions in the presence of [35S]methionine at 15, 30, and 37 °C for 5, 10, or 20 min. To a fourth sample, cold methionine was added after 20 min of labeling and mitochondria were further incubated for 20 min to monitor the stability of translation products. Mitochondria were reisolated and subjected to SDS-PAGE; synthesized proteins were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 4). The mitochondrial genome encodes eight major proteins (31Borst P. Grivell L.A. Cell. 1978; 15: 705-723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which all were synthesized both in wild type and Δguf1 mitochondria. The overall pattern of translation products was comparable between both strains, suggesting that the synthesis of none of the mitochondrially encoded proteins strictly depended on Guf1 under the conditions of the experiment. However, at 15 °C, the translation efficiency in Δguf1 mitochondria was significantly lower than in wild type. This deficiency apparently affected the synthesis of all mitochondrially encoded proteins. In contrast, at 30 and 37 °C the translation efficiencies were not diminished and for Var1, the only soluble mitochondrial translation product, the synthesis was even increased in the absence of Guf1 (Fig. 4, right panels). This suggests that Guf1 is critical to promote protein synthesis at low temperature but at normal or elevated temperatures Guf1 is largely dispensable for the translation reaction per se. Deletion of Guf1 Leads to Reduced Growth at Suboptimal Temperature and under Starvation Conditions—In an initial study it was reported that the deletion of GUF1 does not cause any detectable growth defect (20Kiser G.L. Weinert T.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our observation that at 30 °C, i.e. the standard growth temperature for S. cerevisiae, Δguf1 strains grew almost like wild type on fermentable (not shown) and non-fermentable (Fig. 5A) carbon sources. However, at high temperatures (40 °C) the doubling time of the Δguf1 strain on non-fermentable carbon source was significantly longer than for wild type cells (Fig. 5A). Similarly, at low temperatures (15 °C) the growth rate of the Δguf1 strain was reduced. To determine the growth characteristics in more detail, a variety of different media and conditions was tested, like the addition of different salts, antibiotics, or pH values (data not shown). Most of the conditions were tolerated by the Δguf1 strain. However, when the amount of non-fermentable carbon sources was reduced to growth-limiting conditions Δguf1 cells were much more strongly affected than the wild type already at 30 °C (Fig. 5B). This effect was most prominent in liquid medium but also detectable on plates (Fig. 5C). Although no growth differences were observed on glucose-containing medium, in medium containing non-fermentable carbon sources the growth of Δguf1 cells was affected, indicating that the absence of Guf1 compromises the respiratory competence of yeast cells. It should be noted that the growth defects of Δguf1 cells were influenced by the genetic background of the cells being more prominent in the BY4742 strain than in W303-1A. We conclude that Guf1 is dispensable as long as nutrients are present in excess but becomes critical for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources under starvation conditions. Guf1 Improves the Functionality of Translation Products at High Temperature—The observed relevance of Guf1 at low and high temperature inspired us to assess the expression of Guf1 at different temperatures. Guf1-HA cells were grown at 15, 30, and 37 °C, and the amounts of Guf1-HA were tested by Western blotting (Fig. 6A). For control, the membrane was probed with antibodies against the ribosomal protein Mrpl36 and the heat-inducible matrix protein Hep1. We observed that Guf1-HA was up-regulated at 15 °C and even more at 37 °C, supporting the importance of Guf1 at non-optimal temperatures. To identify the molecular reason for the observed defects of Δguf1 cells, we measured the enzyme activities of the bc1 complex and of cytochrome oxidase (both containing mitochondrially encoded subunits) and of malate dehydrogenase (containing exclusively nuclear encoded subunits) (Fig. 6B). Although the activity of the cytochrome bc1 complex and of malate dehydrogenase was not altered in Δguf1 mitochondria, the activity of cytochrome oxidase was reduced to ∼10%, explaining the impaired growth phenotype of these cultures on non-fermentable carbon sources. The reduced levels of cytochrome oxidase in Δguf1 mitochondria might be caused by a defective synthesis or a diminished insertion of nascent chains into the inner membrane. The Oxa1 complex plays a critical role for the biogenesis of mitochondrial translation products, especially for the insertion and assembly of subunits of the cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 6C). Subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase, Cox2, is the mitochondrial translation product that is most sensitive to defects in Oxa1 (32Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To test whether Guf1 is critical for Oxa1-dependent membrane insertion of Cox2, we radiolabeled translation products in isolated mitoplasts and treated the mitoplasts with protease to digest membrane-embedded proteins (Fig. 6D). Both in wild type and in Δguf1 mitochondria, most translation products were degraded upon addition of protease. Exceptions were Var1, which is the only matrix protein encoded in mitochondria, and subunits 8 and 9 of the ATPase, which both are deeply embedded in the membrane. Mitoplasting was controlled by Western blotting using the inner membrane protein Tim50 and the matrix protein mtHsp70. Because we did not observe any differences between wild type and Δguf1 mitochondria, we conclude that defects in the membrane integration of subunits of cytochrome oxidase do not account for the low amounts of cytochrome oxidase in Δguf1 mutants. Similarly, cross-linking experiments revealed an efficient interaction of Oxa1 with nascent chains in Δguf1 mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S2). The mitochondrial translation machinery is intimately coupled to the insertion apparatus in the inner membrane, mainly due to a physical contact of the C terminus of Oxa1 to ribosomes (5Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Fox T.D. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonnenberg N Translational Control.

Mutants in which only the C-terminal 71 residues of Oxa1 are deleted show a diminished ribosome binding of Oxa1 but are still able to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources (5Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To test for a genetic interaction of Guf1 and Oxa1, we constructed strains in which Guf1 and the C terminus of Oxa1 were individually or simultaneously deleted. As shown in Fig. 6E, we observed a synthetic growth defect of the double mutant that was most pronounced under nutrient-limiting conditions. These observations suggest that the combination of the defects of Oxa1ΔC and Δguf1 reduces the amounts of functional cytochrome oxidase they need for respiratory growth too much to allow respiratory growth of yeast cells. It was shown previously that at elevated temperatures translation products tend to form insoluble membrane-associated aggregates (24Ott M. Prestele M. Bauerschmitt H. Funes S. Bonnefoy N. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To test the accumulation of such aggregates we radiolabeled mitochondrial translation products in wild type and Δguf1 mitochondria that were isolated from starvation cultures. The labeling reaction was carried out at 15, 30, or 37 °C before the mitochondria were lysed with detergent and fractionated into pellet and soluble fractions (Fig. 6F). Especially subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase, Cox2, was found in the insoluble pellet fractions. Hardly any soluble Cox2 protein was found in Δguf1 mitochondria after translation at 30 or 37 °C (Fig. 6F, arrowheads). This indicates that the absence of Guf1 leads to an increased aggregation at least of this translation product. In addition, we observed the accumulation of a small translation product in Δguf1 mitochondria at 30 and 37 °C that aggregated very efficiently (Fig. 6F, asterisk). This product presumably represents the recently identified aberrant splice variant of the COX1 gene, mp15, which is characteristic for mutants defective in assembly of cytochrome oxidase (34Zambrano A. Fontanesi F. Solans A. de Oliveira R.L. Fox T.D. Tzagoloff A. Barrientos A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both the aggregation of Cox2 and the accumulation of the mp15 product point to a diminished quality of the proteins synthesized in Δguf1 mitochondria at elevated temperatures. In contrast to the cytosolic translation reaction, the processes underlying mitochondrial protein synthesis are still poorly understood. Here we describe the so far uncharacterized GTPase Guf1 that, in sequence, is related to the classical translation factors EF-Tu and EF-G (Tuf1, Mef1, and Mef2 in mitochondria). In vitro studies on the bacterial homologue of Guf1, LepA, indicated a role of this protein in the fidelity of the translation reaction. LepA directly interacts with the bacterial ribosomes in a GTP-dependent manner and reduces the probability of translation errors in in vitro translation assays (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Youngman E.M. Green R. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: R136-R139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Comparable in vitro assays to monitor mitochondrial protein synthesis could not be established thus far, presumably due to the intimate association of the mitochondrial translation machinery with the inner membrane (5Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Fox T.D. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonnenberg N Translational Control.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This restricts the biochemical analysis of the molecular role of Guf1 to studies in vivo and in isolated organelles. Guf1 is structurally very similar to E. coli LepA; both show an identity over the entire sequence of 47.9%. This is an exceptionally high degree of sequence conservation between a bacterial and a mitochondrial orthologue, given the ∼1.5 billion years of separate evolution, suggesting a highly conserved function of LepA and Guf1. We report here that Guf1, like LepA, is able to bind to ribosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. When mitochondria were incubated under conditions favoring protein synthesis, we found approximately half of the mitochondrial Guf1 bound to ribosomes. The addition of GTPγS locked also the residual Guf1 in a tightly ribosome-bound state, whereas Guf1 was completely released into the supernatant by addition of GDP. Thus, under translation conditions, a significant fraction of Guf1 is associated with ribosomes. The binding of Guf1 to the mitochondrial translation machinery in a dynamic, GTP-dependent fashion is consistent with a LepA-like function as a fidelity factor for mitochondrial translation. However, the physiological relevance of both LepA and Guf1 remained unclear, because initial studies reported no detectable growth defects in E. coli or yeast deletion mutants under normal laboratory cultivation conditions (19Dibb N.J. Wolfe P.B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 83-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kiser G.L. Weinert T.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also observed no growth defects on standard growth conditions, but the growth of guf1 deletion strains on non-fermentable carbon sources at low or high temperatures was significantly retarded. This growth defect was especially striking under starvation conditions, indicating that Guf1 becomes critical when nutrients are limiting. Similarly, studies by Kurland and co-workers (36Ruusala T. Andersson D. Ehrenberg M. Kurland C.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2575-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) showed that high translational proofreading activities are not necessarily beneficial but, rather, can considerably reduce growth rates of bacterial cultures under certain conditions. Guf1 was found to be tightly associated with the inner membrane of mitochondria. Similarly, LepA was found to be membrane-associated in E. coli (17March P.E. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7500-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, EF-G and EF-Tu are soluble factors in both bacteria and mitochondria. The presence of the LepA gene on the same operon as that of leader peptidase led to the speculation that LepA plays a role in the biogenesis of membrane-inserted or -secreted proteins (16March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1253-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18March P.E. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7206-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental evidence for a specific role of LepA in the synthesis of membrane proteins was, however, lacking so far. Here, we show that Guf1 is critical for the production of functional membrane proteins. The observed growth defect is presumably caused by strongly reduced levels of cytochrome oxidase in the absence of Guf1. The molecular reason for the low cytochrome oxidase levels is not entirely clear. Both the amount of synthesized proteins and their membrane integration were not affected. Our observations suggest rather that the produced translation products fail to form functional and stable cytochrome oxidase complexes. This is reminiscent of experiments with bacterial in vitro translation reactions that showed that LepA had only a moderate effect on the amount of synthesized green fluorescent protein but the lack of LepA significantly reduced the fraction of produced proteins that were functional (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, our observations are compatible with the proposed role of LepA/Guf1 as a fidelity factor for translational elongation (15Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Youngman E.M. Green R. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: R136-R139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). If LepA/Guf1 GTPases perform such an important function as controlling the quality of the translation reaction, why are Δguf1 mutants then not more severely affected? It was suggested that mitochondrial translation products are produced in excess over their nuclear encoded assembly partners (37Luzikov V.N. Revis. Biol. Celular. 1989; 21: 491-503PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal conditions a large fraction of the initially synthesized proteins are degraded (38Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although the degradation of newly synthesized polypeptides seems not economical, the selection of functional translation products is presumably important to prevent the generation of potentially harmful variants of respiratory chain complexes. How this selection system specifically recognizes aberrant translation products is not known, but it seems likely that this selection is functionally and kinetically coupled to the complicated assembly process of mitochondrial translation products. This system of selection and degradation of aberrant proteins may prevent the incorporation of malfunctioning and potentially dangerous subunits into respiratory chain complexes. When, however, during starvation conditions cells are forced to use their energy supplies efficiently, an increased error rate of the translation process might become intolerable, explaining the pronounced growth defect of Δguf1 cells on nutrient-limiting conditions. Recent studies on mammalian model systems suggest that the error rate of mitochondrial gene expression has a strong impact on health and directly contributes to the physiological consequences of the aging process of animals (39Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). It will be exciting in the future to assess the relevance of Guf1 for the accuracy of the translation process in mammalian mitochondria and its potential relevance for the aging process of animals and humans.

It has been suggested before that the reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (r15-LOX) plays an important role in initiating the breakdown of mitochondria in rabbit reticulocytes. The expression of rabbit r15-LOX is regulated by the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) K and E1 at the translational level. However, this mechanism has never been confirmed in human erythropoiesis. Based on K562 cells we have set up an inducible human erythroid cell system. We show that, during induction, K562 cells exhibit changes in morphology and protein expression that are characteristic for terminal erythroid maturation: nuclear exclusion, expression of endogenous human r15-LOX regulated by hnRNP K and hnRNP E1, and loss of mitochondria. Importantly, induction of terminal erythroid maturation in primary human CD34+ cells recapitulated the results obtained in K562 cells. Employing the physiologically relevant K562 cell system we uncovered a new mechanism of interdependent post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The timely expression of the tyrosine kinase c-Src, which phosphorylates hnRNP K in later stages, is controlled by hnRNP K in early stages of erythroid maturation. hnRNP K binds to the 3′-untranslated region of the c-Src mRNA and inhibits its translation by blocking 80 S ribosome formation. In premature erythroid cells, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of hnRNP K, but not of hnRNP E1, leads to the de-repression of c-Src synthesis.

A striking example for such processes is the control of mRNA translation in erythroid precursor cells, which undergo nuclear extrusion when they mature to erythrocytes. In the bone marrow, committed erythroid progenitor cells mature to pro-erythroblasts in which hemoglobin synthesis can first be detected. Subsequently, cell division ceases, and the nucleus is extruded at the maturation level of the polychromatic/ortho-chromatic normoblast (5Castoldi G.L. Beutler E.

Whereas all mRNAs have to be synthesized in the bone marrow erythroblast before this stage, those that are not translated until later in erythroid maturation are stored in translationally silent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (10Thiele B.J.

Enucleated reticulocytes are released into the blood stream and mature until degradation of mitochondria is initiated and reticulocytes become functional erythrocytes.

To prevent synthesis of r15-LOX that would cause mitochondria degradation in premature cells, the timing of r15-LOX mRNA translation activation is controlled tightly (14Höhne M. Thiele B.J. Prehn S.

Ger. 1981; 40: 597-602PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously investigated the translation of rabbit r15-LOX in cell-free systems and in transfected HeLa cells. Initiation of rabbit r15-LOX mRNA translation is inhibited by hnRNP K and hnRNP E1, which bind, singly or together, to the differentiation control element (DICE) in the 3′-UTR of the r15-LOX mRNA (16Ostareck D.H.

Shatsky I.N. Hentze M.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). How is r15-LOX mRNA translation activated? In transfected HeLa cells, hnRNP K, but not hnRNP E1, specifically activates the tyrosine kinase c-Src and is a substrate of this kinase (18Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Cans C. Neubauer G. Bomsztyk K. Superti-Furga G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4535-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). c-Src-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine 458 in the hnRNP K homology (KH) domain 3 of hnRNP K leads to the loss of its DICE-binding activity and consequently its role as an inhibitor of rabbit r15-LOX mRNA translation in vitro (19Messias A.C.

The model of r15-LOX mRNA translation regulation is built on experimental data that were obtained in cell-free systems and in transfected HeLa cells but has not been investigated in an erythroid cell system so far. To analyze the biochemical pathways that control r15-LOX expression, the development of an inducible erythroid cell system was required. For this purpose we made use of human K562 cells, which represent the pro-erythroblast stage (22Andersson L.C. Jokinen M. Gahmberg C.G. Nature. 1979; 278: 364-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Here we show that premature human K562 cells undergo terminal erythroid maturation when stimulated with butyrate and exhibit nuclear exclusion, expression of endogenous human r15-LOX regulated by hnRNP K and E1, and loss of mitochondria. Terminal erythroid maturation of primary CD34+ cells recapitulated the results obtained in K562 cells. Further investigation of the factors involved in this regulatory pathway revealed an interesting feedback mechanism. Employing immunoprecipitation experiments, in vitro mRNA binding assays and in vitro translation studies as well as RNA interference (RNAi), we found that hnRNP K, but not hnRNP E1, regulates the timely expression of c-Src during erythroid maturation. To our knowledge, these data indicate for the first time that the expression of a tyrosine kinase that is important for erythropoiesis is regulated at the level of translation. Plasmids—pET16b-hnRNP K, pET16b-hnRNP K 5RG, and pGEM-CAT were described previously (16Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W.

The hydroperoxy fatty acids formed were reduced with sodium borohydride to stabilize 15-hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid, the primary reaction product of r15-LOX, as 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). The reaction mixture was acidified, and proteins were precipitated by addition of 0.7 ml of methanol. The pellet was spun down, and aliquots of the clear supernatant were subjected to reversed-phase HPLC, which was performed on a Shimatzu HPLC system connected to a Hewlett Packard diode array detector 1040. Analytes were separated on a Nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel, KS-system, 250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size) coupled to a guard column (30 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size). The absorbance was recorded at 235 nm in a methanol/water/acetic acid (80:20:0.1, v/v) solvent system. Fractions co-eluting with 15-HETE were collected, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was reconstituted in hexane. The enantiomer composition of 15-HETE was analyzed by chiral phase HPLC on a Chiracel OD column using the solvent system hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100:5:0.1, v/v). Again the absorbance was recorded at 235 nm. Immunoprecipitation—20 μl of protein A-Sepharose coupled with the hnRNP K or Fyn antibody was incubated with 100 μg of cytoplasmic K562 cell extract for 1.5 h at 4 °C in IPP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). Beads were washed twice in IPP buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the supernatant was analyzed in Western blot assays. For RT-PCR co-immunoprecipitated RNA was isolated from the pellet with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—K562 cells or CD34+ cells were spun on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Staining was performed as described previously (20Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Moritz B. Hüttelmaier S. Flach N. Handoko L. Wahle E. J. Biol.

Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Mitochondria were stained with Mito-Tracker orange (Invitrogen). For microscopy an E600 (Nikon) or Axiovert 200M (Zeiss) microscope equipped with cameras (Hamamatsu, Zeiss) was used. Images were acquired by Lucia (Nikon) or AxioVision (Zeiss) software and compiled with Corel Technical Suite 12. 700 K562 cells were counted from three independent experiments to determine the number of cells lacking the nucleus and mitochondria. Antibodies—Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (hnRNP K, Lyn, Fyn, p-Tyr, CD34, glycophorin A), Oncogene (v-Src), Abcam (GAPDH and PRMT1) and Sigma (α-tubulin) and used according to the manufacturer's protocol.

For immunofluorescence microscopy of CD34+ cells an hnRNP E1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used that allowed co-staining of CD34. The monoclonal antibody against non-methylated hnRNP K (non-Rmet K) was generated against the internal sequence of human hnRNP K, bearing non-methylated arginine residues (255MRGRGGFDRMPPGRGGRP272). The peptide was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or ovalbumin (PSL, Heidelberg). Lou/c rats were immunized with 50 μg of peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin using CPG 2006 and incomplete Freunds adjuvant as adjuvant. Supernatants were tested in a differential enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Peptide-specific antibodies were analyzed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation through the use of extracts from ES PRMT1+/+ and PRMT1-/- cells and recombinant hnRNP K (20Ostareck-Lederer A.

https://openalex.org/W2085334472,"The DNA damage checkpoint regulates DNA replication and arrests cell cycle progression in response to genotoxic stress. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein kinase Rad53 plays a central role in preventing genomic instability and maintaining viability in the presence of replication stress and DNA damage. Activation of Rad53 depends on phosphorylation by the upstream kinase Mec1, followed by autophosphorylation on multiple residues. Also critical for cell viability, the molecular mechanism of Rad53 deactivation remains incompletely understood. Rad53 dephosphorylation after repair of a persistent double strand break in G2/M has been shown to depend on the presence of the PP2C-type phosphatases Ptc2 and Ptc3. More recently, the PP2A-like protein phosphatase Pph3 has been shown to be required to dephosphorylate Rad53 after DNA methylation damage in S phase. However, we show here that Ptc2/3 are dispensable for Rad53 deactivation after replication stress or DNA methylation damage. Pph3 is also dispensable for the deactivation of Rad53 after replication stress. In addition, Rad53 kinase activity is still deactivated in pph3 null cells after DNA methylation damage, despite persistent Rad53 hyperphosphorylation. Finally, a strain in which the three phosphatases are deleted shows a severe defect in Rad53 kinase deactivation after DNA methylation damage but not after replication stress. In all, our results suggest that distinct phosphatases operate to return Rad53 to its basal state after different genotoxic stresses and that a yet unidentified phosphatase may be responsible for the deactivation of Rad53 after replication stress."

Regulating and maintaining acid-base homeostasis is critical for normal cell, tissue, and systemic function. Transporters in several transporter families are involved in this multilevel pH regulation: Slc4 (bicarbonate transporters), Slc9 4SLC is the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) nomenclature for solute carrier genes (see Ref. 4Alper S.L.

Slc9 proteins) play important pH regulatory roles in many cells and tissues. Nevertheless, in many cells, HCO3- transporters carry even more acid-base equivalents than NHEs and are often more active in CO2/ HCO3- environments (normal cellular and tissue buffering system). The importance of HCO3- transporters has been further highlighted by the existence of severe pathogenic mutations (reviewed in Ref. 4Alper S.L. Annu. Rev.

These patients with mutations in the NBCe1 coding sequence have permanent proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA type II, i.e. pHblood ∼7.05, [ HCO3-] = 3-11 mm; normal blood pH = 7.35-7.45, [ HCO3-] = 23-25 mm) with early onset, bilateral glaucoma, bilateral cataracts, and band keratopathy, yet without obvious intestinal or pancreatic defects (1Igarashi T.

A transmembrane topography of the human NBCe1-B has been proposed based on glycosylation studies (17Tatishchev S. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Newman D. Liu W. Weeks D. Sachs G. Kurtz I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). None of the proposed structural models dispute the Arg-298 location, i.e. residing in the center of the cytoplasmic N terminus of NBCe1 and not obviously associated with the transmembrane domain. How then does this placement translate to malfunction of the R298S-NBCe1 protein? Does this imply that HCO3- permeation and/or affinity is associated with the cytoplasmic N terminus? Transmembrane domains of membrane proteins are generally thought to control ion permeability across membranes. However, knowing the sequence and predicted structural location (based on linear sequence) is not always the best predictor of structure. NBCe1 is a member of the HCO3- transporter gene family that includes Band 3 (AE1/SLC4A1). All SLC4 members have >35% sequence identity, particularly in predicted membrane spans. Although crystals were recently obtained for this region of NBCe1, only gross topology rather than amino acid assignment was reported (18Gill H.S. Boron W.F. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that we could gain insights into NBCe1 structure and function by mapping its amino acid sequence onto the AE1 N-terminal structure (3Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This structural prediction indicated that Arg-298, a conserved residue in SLC4 proteins, is located in a solvent-inaccessible pocket. The model further predicted that Arg-298 has charge interactions with Glu-295 and Glu-91, both of which are also conserved in SLC4 HCO3- transporter proteins. Are these sequence alignments coincidence, or is the Band 3 N-terminal structure a good predictor of NBCe1 N-terminal structure? In this study, we use point mutations to perturb the charge interaction between Glu-91 and Arg-298. Our results indicate that Arg-298, Glu-91, and their interaction are crucial for the NBCe1 N-terminal structure as well as the normal physiological function of NBCe1. Thus, this structural model and the following experiments elucidate, on the molecular level, “why” R298S causes a proximal RTA with bilateral cataracts and glaucoma. These results suggest that the NBCe1 cytoplasmic N terminus dictates/controls HCO3- permeation or affinity. These results also challenge the general belief that the N terminus of membrane proteins, like NBCe1, is not directly involved with substrate transport but rather is merely serving as a protein anchor, as is believed for the AE1 N terminus (3Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NBCe1 N Terminus Structure Modeling—A pair-wise alignment of sequences of human kidney NBCe1 (residues 62-371) and AE1 (residues 55-356) accession codes M27819 was prepared in the Swiss-PdbViewer (SPDBV (19Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar)) or externally with SIM and the Blosum62 algorithm (20Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar). These nearly identical alignments, when submitted together with the coordinates for AE1 (Protein Data Bank accession code 1HYN) to the Swiss-model server (21Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar), did not yield an initial model due to failure of identifying appropriate loops. Despite a 36.5% overall sequence identity between these proteins, there is a region among NBCe1 (residues 113-174) and AE1 (residues 165-218) that does not show much sequence similarity, reducing the threading reliability in this area. Thus, multiple sequence alignments with the ClustalW algorithms (DNASTAR) were made to identify boundaries of conserved and variable sequence regions within and across homologous domains of the Slc4 protein families. The resulting manually optimized binary alignment between NBCe1 and AE1 served as input for Swiss model. The returned initial model, based on the four individual copies of the domain in HYN, was briefly minimized. Side chain conformations were subsequently optimized with SCWRL3 (22Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and minimized to yield the present model structure (Fig. 2B). The NBCe1 model was then analyzed with the programs VADAR, Procheck, and WHAT IF (23Willard L. Ranjan A. Zhang H. Monzavi H. Boyko R.F. Sykes B.D. Wishart D.S.

Cloning and Mutations—The human kidney NBCe1 (hkNBCe1) clone in a Xenopus expression plasmid was previously described (9Dinour D. Chang M.-H. Satoh J.-I. Smith B.L. Angle N. Knecht A. Serban I. Holtzman E.J. Romero M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52238-52246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). hkNBCe1 mutations were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced for verification (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, New Haven, CT). Linearized cDNA was used to make capped cRNA with the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (26Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hemagglutinin affinity tag “HA tag” was engineered into the extracellular loop of hkNBCe1 at the Ser-596 → Ser-610 region with a linker (SNDTTLAP-DYPYDVPDYAG-EYLPTMS) as that described in McAlear et al. (27McAlear S.D. Liu X. Williams J.B. McNicholas-Bevensee C.M. Bevensee M.O. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 639-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This HA tag insertion does not affect NBCe1 activity or sensitivity to stil-benes (27McAlear S.D. Liu X. Williams J.B. McNicholas-Bevensee C.M. Bevensee M.O. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 639-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Using an anti-HA 1° antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 2° antibody with a chemiluminescent substrate, we were able to quantify surface expression of hkNBCe1 clones in a luminometer. The single-oocyte chemiluminescence technique utilizes enzyme amplification of chemiluminescence substrate to quantify a HA-tagged protein expressed at the cell surface (28Margeta-Mitrovic M.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). This technique has a linear relationship between surface expression detected by single-oocyte chemiluminescence and functional activity of the K+ channel, ROMK (Kir 1.1), as reported by Yoo et al. (30Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L. King A. Maouyo D. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Oocyte Experimental Solutions—The CO2/ HCO3--free ND96 contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES. In CO2/ HCO3--equilibrated solutions, 33 mm NaHCO3 replaced 33 mm NaCl; all CO2/ HCO3- solutions are 5% CO2, 33 mm HCO3- (pH 7.5). In 0-Na+ solutions, choline replaced Na+. All the solutions used in the experiments were adjusted to pH 7.5 and 195-200 mosm. Oocyte Electrophysiology—50 nL of water (control) or RNA solution (25 ng of hkNBCe1 or mutant cRNA) was injected into stage V/VI Xenopus oocytes. Voltage electrodes, made from fiber-capillary borosilicate and filled with 3 m KCl, had resistances of 1-10 megaohms (31Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Ion-selective electrodes were pulled similarly and silanized with bis-(dimethylamino)-dimethylsilane (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY). pH electrode tips were filled with hydrogen ionophore 1 mixture B (Fluka) and back-filled with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Electrodes were connected to a high-impedance electrometer (WPI-FD223 for intracellular pH (pHi) and Vm experiments), and digitized output data (filtered at 10Hz) were acquired by PCLAMP software sampling at 0.5 Hz. All ion-selective microelectrodes had slopes of -54 to -57 mV/decade ion concentration (or activity). pH electrodes were calibrated at pH 6.0 and 8.0. For voltage-clamp experiments, electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl/agar and 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.2-0.5 megaohms. Oocytes were clamped at -60 mV, and current was constantly monitored and recorded at 10 Hz (Warner Inst. Co., Oocyte Clamp OC-725C). Voltage steps pulses (75 ms) were executed from -160 to +60 mV in 20 mV steps; the resulting I-V traces were filtered at 2 kHz (8 pole Bessel filter) and sampled at 10 kHz. Data were acquired and analyzed using Pulse and PulseFit (HEKA Instruments, Germany). Oocyte Surface Protein Expression—Oocyte labeling was performed at 4 °C. Oocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in ND96 for 15 min, washed and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin-ND96 blocking solution for 30 min. Oocytes were labeled with a 1° antibody (1:200 dilution, monoclonal rat-α-HA 1° antibody (Roche Applied Science)) for 60 min, and then with a 2° antibody (1:2000 dilution, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-α-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories)) for 30 min in 1% bovine serum albumin-ND96 blocking solution. Labeled oocytes were washed several times and incubated in ND96 for 10 min before exposure to 50 μl of the premixed SuperSignal ELISA Femto substrate solution (Pierce) at room temperature. Chemiluminescent was measured from single oocytes in a microcentrifuge tube using a TD-20/20n luminometer (Turner BioSystems). Measurements were taken at 30 s after initiation of the luminescent reaction. Statistical Analysis—Values, quantity of ion activities, or currents are indicated as the mean ± S.E. The total apparent buffering power (βT, see Table 1) is defined as the change in pHi before and after application of CO2/ HCO3- (once steady state is reached) divided by the pHi change elicited from the same solution changes, i.e. βT =Δ[ HCO3-]steady state/ΔpHi(9Dinour D.

When CO2 crosses to the inside of a Xenopus oocyte, this H+ formation results in a cellular acidification (decrease of pHi). The addition of 5% CO2, 33 mm HCO3-, pH 7.5 (CO2/ HCO3-) to the bath solution resulted in a fast acidification in a water-injected control oocyte (Fig. 1A). When hkNBCe1 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, this CO2-induced acidification in oocytes was much less. This decrease reflects the transport of extracellular HCO3- into the cell (via NBCe1), counteracting acidification by CO2 hydration (Fig. 1B). The bicarbonate transport is accompanied by a large positive (outward) current (Fig. 1, B and E, squares) due to the 1 Na+: n HCO3- stoichiometry of NBCe1 and the negative charge movement (32Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gross E. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Kurtz I. Cotton C.U. J. Physiol.

(Lond.). 2001; 531: 597-603Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). No similar current can be observed in the water-injected oocytes (Fig. 1, A and E, circles). Sodium replacement with choline (hereafter referred as Na+ removal or “0Na+”) in a HCO3- solution reverses the HCO3- transport direction (Fig. 1, B and D, 0Na+). That is, HCO3- is now moving out of the cell resulting in a fast acidification and an inward current for a hkNBCe1-expressing oocyte (9Dinour D. Chang M.-H. Satoh J.-I. Smith B.L. Angle N. Knecht A. Serban I. Holtzman E.J. Romero M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52238-52246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and D, 0Na+, and Fig. 1F), equivalent to renal NaHCO3 absorption. Na+ removal in HCO3- creates no detectable pHi change or current in the water-injected oocytes. One can use these parameters (current magnitude, Imax, and the rate of acidification, dpHi/dt) with or without CO2/ HCO3- solution ±Na+ to depict the transporter function (Table 1). The overall NBCe1-transporter contribution can also be portrayed by the buffering power (βT) in the unit of mm/pH unit. The voltage dependence of these hkNBCe1 currents (I-V curves; Fig. 1, E and F) illustrate that the membrane potential (electrical driving force) can over-come the chemical gradients for both Na+ and HCO3-. To understand the R298S pathophysiology, we recreated this point mutation in wild-type hkNBCe1 (WT) and expressed it in Xenopus oocytes. Results show that R298S is a moderately functioning mutation with decreased HCO3- affinity/capacity (Fig. 1, C-F, and Table 1). The CO2/ HCO3--elicited outward current and the R298S-Na+-dependent currents are significantly lower than those observed in WT. The R298S acidification rate is 78% faster than that of WT in CO2/ HCO3- (indicating slower transport), and the acidification due to Na+ removal (renal absorption) is significantly slower than that of WT (Fig. 1D; -71 versus -130 × 10-5 pH units/s). Comparing the rate before (NaHCO3 influx) and after (NaHCO3 efflux) Na+ removal in HCO3- solution, the dpHi/dt of R298S is decreased rather than increased as in WT, showing that HCO3- transport function is deficient in this human mutation. The βT of R298S is also much less than that of WT (Table 1). The differences in the current magnitude between WT and R298S are voltage-dependent, yet the reversal potential (at 0 current) remains unchanged (Fig. 1E). The NBCe1 I-V responses further illustrate that R298S is a moderate mutation with lower apparent HCO3- transport capacity and Na+ affinity than WT. To elucidate the role of R298S in NBCe1 transport, we initiated structure-function studies. Our rationale was that sequence alignments of highly conserved residues of well characterized Slc4 protein sequences from divergent species could reveal candidate residues of transport importance (Fig. 2). Members of the SLC4 family share 48.7% sequence identity through predicted membrane-spanning regions, although the animal Slc4 family includes functionally distinct transporters(35Romero M.F. Fulton C.M. Boron W.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar): (a) anion exchangers, (b) Na+/ HCO3- cotransporters, and (c) Na+-driven Cl-- HCO3- exchangers. Interestingly, even higher identities among Slc4 members are found within their N termini, particularly within spans of the folded N-terminal cytoplasmic domains (57.2% on average; NBCe1 has 67% identity among orthologs). Indeed, several 5-10-amino-acid stretches have 100% identity (36Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 699-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A), including the absolutely conserved Arg-298 (hkNBCe1 numbering, equivalent to Arg-283 in AE1) and its sequential neighbors. Since mutation of Arg-298 results in renal and ocular disease and appears important for proper transporter function, we reasoned that functional insight into NBCe1 would be gained by homology modeling. The human NBCe1 N-terminal amino acid model (Fig. 2, B-E) is based on the only known Slc4 structure, the structure for the cytoplasmic N terminus Band 3 (AE1/SLC4A1) solved by x-ray crystallography (3Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Lipid-derived reactive aldehydes are subject to phase-2 metabolism and are predominantly found as mercapturic acid (MA) conjugates in urine. This study shows evidence for the in vivo formation of ONE and its phase-1 metabolites, 4-oxo-2-nonen-1-ol (ONO) and 4-oxo-2-nonenoic acid (ONA). We have detected the MA conjugates of HNE, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene (DHN), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid (HNA), the lactone of HNA, ONE, ONO, and ONA in rat urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry comparison with synthetic standards prepared in our laboratory. CCl(4) treatment of rats, a widely accepted animal model of acute oxidative stress, resulted in a significant increase in the urinary levels of DHN-MA, HNA-MA lactone, ONE-MA, and ONA-MA.

https://openalex.org/W1991555520,"Similar to many flavivirus types including Dengue and yellow fever viruses, the nonstructural NS3 multifunctional protein of West Nile virus (WNV) with an N-terminal serine proteinase domain and an RNA triphosphatase, an NTPase domain, and an RNA helicase in the C-terminal domain is implicated in both polyprotein processing and RNA replication and is therefore a promising drug target. To exhibit its proteolytic activity, NS3 proteinase requires the presence of the cofactor encoded by the upstream NS2B sequence. During our detailed investigation of the biology of the WNV helicase, we characterized the ATPase and RNA/DNA unwinding activities of the full-length NS2B-NS3 proteinase-helicase protein as well as the individual NS3 helicase domain lacking both the NS2B cofactor and the NS3 proteinase sequence and the individual NS3 proteinase-helicase lacking only the NS2B cofactor. We determined that both the NS3 helicase and NS3 proteinase-helicase constructs are capable of unwinding both the DNA and the RNA templates. In contrast, the full-length NS2B-NS3 proteinase-helicase unwinds only the RNA templates, whereas its DNA unwinding activity is severely repressed. Our data suggest that the productive, catalytically competent fold of the NS2B-NS3 proteinase moiety represents an essential component of the RNA-DNA substrate selectivity mechanism in WNV and, possibly, in other flaviviruses. Based on our data, we hypothesize that the mechanism we have identified plays a role yet to be determined in WNV replication occurring both within the virus-induced membrane-bound replication complexes in the host cytoplasm and in the nuclei of infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2047924793,"The human thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (hTSHR) belongs to the glycoprotein hormone receptors that bind the hormones at their large extracellular domain. The extracellular hinge region of the TSHR connects the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain with the membrane-spanning serpentine domain. From previous studies we reasoned that apart from hormone binding at the leucine-rich repeat domain, additional multiple hormone contacts might exist at the hinge region of the TSHR by complementary charge-charge recognition. Here we investigated highly conserved charged residues in the hinge region of the TSHR by site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acids interacting with bovine TSH (bTSH). Indeed, the residues Glu-297, Glu-303, and Asp-382 in the TSHR hinge region are essential for bTSH binding and partially for signal transduction. Side chain substitutions showed that the negative charge of Glu-297 and Asp-382 is necessary for recognition of bTSH by the hTSHR. Multiple combinations of alanine mutants of the identified positions revealed an increased negative effect on hormone binding. An assembled model suggests that the deciphered acidic residues form negatively charged patches at the hinge region resulting in an extended binding mode for bTSH on the hTSHR. Our data indicate that certain positively charged residues of bTSH might be involved in interaction with the identified negatively charged amino acids of the hTSHR hinge region. We demonstrate that the hinge region represents an extracellular intermediate connector for both hormone binding and signal transduction of the hTSHR. The human thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (hTSHR) belongs to the glycoprotein hormone receptors that bind the hormones at their large extracellular domain. The extracellular hinge region of the TSHR connects the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain with the membrane-spanning serpentine domain. From previous studies we reasoned that apart from hormone binding at the leucine-rich repeat domain, additional multiple hormone contacts might exist at the hinge region of the TSHR by complementary charge-charge recognition. Here we investigated highly conserved charged residues in the hinge region of the TSHR by site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acids interacting with bovine TSH (bTSH). Indeed, the residues Glu-297, Glu-303, and Asp-382 in the TSHR hinge region are essential for bTSH binding and partially for signal transduction.

We demonstrate that the hinge region represents an extracellular intermediate connector for both hormone binding and signal transduction of the hTSHR.

A common structural characteristic of all GPHRs is the large N-terminal extracellular domain, which is responsible for hormone recognition and binding (4Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Smits G. Campillo M. Govaerts C. Janssens V. Richter C. Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2692-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The N-terminal terminal extracellular domain of the TSHR (amino acids Met-1—Asp-410) can be subdivided into the leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) and the hinge region. The hinge region can be further subdivided into the N-terminal cysteine-box 2, the cysteine-box 2/3 linker, and the C-terminal cysteine-box 3 located close to transmembrane helix 1 (TMH1) (6Kleinau G. Brehm M. Wiedemann U. Labudde D. Leser U. Krause G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The hinge region links the extracellular hormone binding LRRD of the TSHR with the transmembrane domain. However, this part of the ectodomain lacks experimental structural data. Recently, the binding arrangements between the human FSH and the hormone binding LRRD of the FSHR have been identified by x-ray analysis (7Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, the hinge region is not included in this crystal structure (7Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Moreover, a crystal structure of the corresponding LRRD of the TSHR (amino acids 30–260) in complex with a thyroid stimulating autoantibody also provides only structural information for the particular LRRD portion and not for the entire extracellular domain of the receptor (8Sanders J. Chirgadze D.Y. Sanders P. Baker S. Sullivan A. Bhardwaja A. Bolton J. Reeve M. Nakatake N. Evans M. Richards T. Powell M. Miguel R.N. Blundell T.L. Furmaniak J. Smith B.R. Thyroid. 2007; 17: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recent studies using monoclonal antibodies, autoantibodies, and synthetic peptides suggest that epitopes within the hinge region are involved in TSH binding (9Costagliola S. Panneels V. Bonomi M.

A chimeric TSH/LHCG receptor containing only the hinge region of the TSH receptor in the ectodomain revealed also the possibility that TSH can bind to the hinge region (16Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Costagliola et al. (9Costagliola S. Panneels V. Bonomi M. Koch J. Many M.C. Smits G. Vassart G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of sulfation on a tyrosine in a conserved motif (385YDY387) located downstream of the third C-terminal cysteine cluster. This post-translational modification outside the LRRD segment is mandatory for high affinity TSH binding and for TSHR activation (9Costagliola S. Panneels V. Bonomi M. Koch J. Many M.C. Smits G. Vassart G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that a mutation at position Tyr-385 affects TSH binding (11Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19413-19418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of sulfation on homologous tyrosines was also demonstrated for the corresponding hinge region of the FSHR and LHCGR (17Bonomi M. Busnelli M. Persani L. Vassart G. Costagliola S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 3351-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that such an introduction of a negative electrostatic potential by sulfation at corresponding positions in all three GPHRs seems to be essential for hormone recognition and binding.In line with this interpretation it is well known that additional positive charges at specific residues of the corresponding hormones improve the binding affinity with the receptor (18Szkudlinski M.W. Teh N.G. Grossmann M. Tropea J.E. Weintraub B.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Szkudlinski M.W. Cancer Treat. Res. 2004; 122: 345-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That applies to bovine TSH (bTSH), which contains more positively charged residues and shows higher affinity to the hTSHR compared with human TSH (hTSH). Moreover, superactive TSH and CG analogs are characterized by additional positively charged amino acid side chains (18Szkudlinski M.W. Teh N.G. Grossmann M. Tropea J.E. Weintraub B.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the human FSHR LRRD-human FSH complex (7Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and the expected homologies in other GPHR·GPH complexes suggest that the additional positively charged residues are located in the peripheral loops of the α and β subunits of bTSH and superagonists and would not participate in the LRRD-hormone complex. They rather seem to interact elsewhere, most likely with the hinge region. Consequently, in addition to the bTSH binding at the LRRD, there are very likely simultaneous additional multiple hormone contacts by complementary charge recognitions also to the hinge region of the TSHR.The goal of our study was to clarify essential contact points for initial TSHR activation by bTSH; in particular, to identify charged determinants for hormone binding and receptor activation at the TSHR hinge region. Twelve charged residues of the hinge region, except the cleavable C-peptide region Ala-317-Gly-367 (20Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Mol.

Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), were substituted by alanine. Indeed, we identified three distinct mutants at negatively charged residues with a cell surface expression comparable with the wt but with a strong decrease in bTSH binding. Moreover, the functional characterization of further substitutions at these residues showed that the negative charges of Glu-297 and Asp-382 are crucial for bTSH binding and that both positions are involved in cAMP signaling.Taken together, our data show that apart from amino acids of the LRR domain, distinctive positions at the hinge region are also important for hormone binding. This finding demonstrates that the hinge region of the TSHR represents both a TSH binding site and an important extracellular signal transduction interface for the forwarding of the intramolecular activation signal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into the human TSHR via site-directed mutagenesis using PfuTurbo DNA-polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), whereas the human TSHR-pSVL (22Libert F. Lefort A. Gerard C. Parmentier M. Perret J. Ludgate M. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1250-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) was used as template. PCR products were transformed into competent DH5-α cells. Plasmid preparation was done using a commercial kit (Qiagen). Mutated TSHR sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing of the complete TSHR with dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing chemistry (ABI Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD). Sequencing reactions were analyzed on a Genetic analyzer ABI 3100 (ABI Advanced Biotechnologies).Cell Culture and Transfection—For transfection, COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator were used. GeneJammer® transfection reagent (Stratagene) was used for transfection of COS-7 cells, whereas a transfection efficiency of 60–70% of viable cells could be achieved for each experiment. Cells were transiently transfected in 12-well plates (10 × 104 cells per well) with 1.0 μg of DNA/well for FACS analysis, in 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) with 0.5 μg of DNA/well for determination of cAMP and EC50 values, and in 48-well plates (2.5 × 104 cells/well) with 0.25 μg of DNA/well for TSH binding analysis. Controls included transfection of the wild type human TSHR and the pSVL vector alone. Each cAMP or binding experiment was done simultaneously with a FACS control from the same transfection. Transfection efficiency was kept constant (∼60–70% of viable cells) for each mutant in each experiment.FACS Analysis— 48 h after transfection cells were detached from the dishes with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred in Falcon 2054 tubes. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a 1:200 dilution of a mouse anti-human TSHR monoclonal antibody 2C11 (MAK1281, Linaris, Wertheim-Bettingen; 10 μg/ml) in the same buffer. Afterward, cells were washed twice and incubated at 4°C for 1 h in the dark with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Serotec, Oxford, UK). Before fixation of cells with 1% paraformaldehyde, they were washed twice. Receptor expression was determined by the mean fluorescence intensity using the FACscan (BD Biosciences). The wt TSHR was set at 100%, and mutant receptor expression was calculated according to this. The percentage of signal-positive cells corresponds to transfection efficiency.Radioligand Binding Assay—To investigate TSH binding properties, competitive binding studies were performed 48 h after transfection as previously described (23Wonerow P.

Paschke R. Krause G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51590-51600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated in modified Hanks' buffer (5.36 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 5.55 mm glucose) supplemented with 1.3 mm CaCl2, 280 mm sucrose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2.5% milk powder in the presence of 160,000–200,000 cpm of 125I-labeled bTSH (Brahms, Hennigsdorf; specific activity, ∼50 μCi/μg) with increasing concentrations of nonlabeled bTSH (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 milliunits/ml) at 4 °C for 4 h. Thereafter, cells were washed with the same ice-cold buffer and solubilized with 1 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured in a gamma-counter. The empty pSVL vector was used as control. The kinetic parameters maximal TSH binding capacity and IC50 in nm (concentration of cold bTSH necessary to displace half of bound 125I-labeled TSH) were calculated by nonlinear regression of competition binding curves using Graph Pad Prism 4.0 for Windows assuming a one-site binding model (25Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal bTSH binding of wt TSHR was set at 100%, and the bTSH binding of all mutants was calculated according to this.cAMP Accumulation Assay— 48 h after transfection measurement of cAMP accumulation was performed. Cells were incubated with serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For TSHR stimulation the medium was supplemented with 100 milliunits/ml bTSH (Sigma). For determination of EC50 values, cells were stimulated with 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30, 100 milliunits/ml bTSH. After 1 h the reaction was terminated by aspiration of the medium. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by incubation with 0.1 n HCl for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and dried at 54 °C. The cAMP contents of the cell extracts were determined using the cAMP AlphaScreen™ assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EC50/IC50 ratio of the mutants were calculated from the respective EC50 and IC50 values, both in nm.Statistics—Statistical analysis was carried out by t test using GraphPad Prism 4.03 for Windows.Molecular Modeling—The x-ray crystal structure of the human FSHR LRRD-human FSH complex (7Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) (PDB entry code 1XWD) was used as structural template for a complex model for the N-terminal hTSHR-LRRD ectodomain with bTSH. The bTSH model is based on homology to disulfide bridges at human FSH which were incorporated: α-subunit, Cys-31/Cys-55, Cys-34/Cys-84, Cys-52/Cys-106, Cys-56/Cys-108, Cys-83/Cys-111; β-subunit, Cys-22/Cys-72, Cys-36/Cys-87, Cys-39/Cys-125, Cys-47/Cys-103, Cys-51/Cys-105, and Cys-108/Cys-115. The hTSHR LRRD structure is C-terminal-restricted at amino acid Ala-254. The assembled TSHR LRRD-TSH model was soaked with water in a periodic boundary box. Initially the LRRD atoms were kept fixed to relax the water during minimization. Later on the entire system was considered. Reported low root mean square values between backbones of the used FSHR LRRD template structure and the recently presented TSHR-LRRD x-ray structure (8Sanders J. Chirgadze D.Y. Sanders P. Baker S.

Due to (i) the higher similarity in length and amino acid sequence of ECL2 between rhodopsin and TSHR (36.0%) versus β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and TSHR (27.6%) and (ii) a β2-AR-specific additional internal cysteine bridge which stabilizes a helical fold in the ECL2 of the β2-AR, we kept the rhodopsin like β-hairpin structure and location of ECL2 also for the TSHR model. Additionally this rhodopsin-like ECL2 conformation is consistent with results of diverse studies at other GPCRs (31Dragic T. Trkola A. Lin S.W. Nagashima K.A. Kajumo F. Zhao L. Olson W.C. Wu L.

Several TSH receptor-specific corrections were made, such as regular helix extensions in TMH2 and TMH5 of TSHR instead of structural bulges in the two helices of rhodopsin, caused there specifically by side chains that are not present in TSHR (two consecutive threonines in TMH2 and a proline in TMH5, respectively). Loops were added by best fit and homology to fragments of other proteins (from the Protein Data Bank). Gaps of missing residues in the loops of the template structure were closed by the Loop Search tool implemented in Sybyl 7.3 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO).Conjugate gradient minimizations for all models were performed until converging at a termination gradient of 0.05 kcal/(mol·Å); the AMBER 7.0 force field (34Case D.A.

Quality and stability of the model were validated by checking the geometry by PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol.

For all mutants the FACS analysis showed a cell surface expression of 80–97% of the wt (wt set at 100%), except E369A, with only 65%. Most of the 12 alanine mutants exhibited a bTSH binding similar to the respective FACS result. However, three alanine mutations of the negatively charged residues Glu-297, Glu-303, and Asp-382 revealed a significant decrease in the bTSH binding capability (Table 1; Fig. 1A). The detected bTSH binding was reduced to 60% for E303A, 51% for D382A, and 40% for E297A compared with the wt (Table 1).TABLE 1Functional characterization of alanine mutations in the hinge region After cloning into the expression vector pSVL, the mutated TSH receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Characterization of the mutants was performed by determination of cell surface expression measured by FACS and bTSH binding.

All combinations showed a cell surface expression level like the wt (Table 1). However, in comparison to the single mutants, the double mutant E297A/D382A and the triple mutant E297A/E303A/D382A revealed a strongly decreased bTSH binding (Fig. 1B; Table 2). In contrast, bTSH binding for the combinations E297A/E303A and E303A/D382A were similar to the level of the single mutants E297A and D382A (∼50%) and did not show a further decrease in TSH binding (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Based on the observed increased negative effect on TSH binding for multiple substitutions containing D382A or simultaneously D382A and E297A we conclude that amino acids Glu-297 and Asp-382 are most essential for bTSH binding and that these residues most likely act simultaneously during the hormone binding process.TABLE 2Functional characterization of mutations at positions Glu-297, Glu-303, and D382A The mutated TSH receptors were cloned into the expression vector pSVL and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2071763658,"It has been four years since the original publication of the draft sequence of the rat genome. Five groups are now working together to assemble, annotate and release an updated version of the rat genome. As the prevailing model for physiology, complex disease and pharmacological studies, there is an acute need for the rat's genomic resources to keep pace with the rat's prominence in the laboratory. In this commentary, we describe the current status of the rat genome sequence and the plans for its impending 'upgrade'. We then cover the key online resources providing access to the rat genome, including the new SNP views at Ensembl, the RefSeq and Genes databases at the US National Center for Biotechnology Information, Genome Browser at the University of California Santa Cruz and the disease portals for cardiovascular disease and obesity at the Rat Genome Database."
https://openalex.org/W1969202124,"Coagulation factor XI (FXI) is a covalent homodimer consisting of two identical subunits of 80 kDa linked by a disulfide bond formed by Cys-321 within the Apple 4 domain of each subunit. Because FXI(C321S) is a noncovalent dimer, residues within the interface between the two subunits must mediate its homodimeric structure. The crystal structure of FXI demonstrates formation of salt bridges between Lys-331 of one subunit and Glu-287 of the other subunit and hydrophobic interactions at the interface of the Apple 4 domains involving Ile-290, Leu-284, and Tyr-329. FXI(C321S), FXI(C321S,K331A), FXI(C321S,E287A), FXI(C321S,I290A), FXI(C321S,Y329A), FXI(C321S,L284A), FXI(C321S,K331R), and FXI(C321S,H343A) were expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized using size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy, and functional assays. Whereas FXI(C321S) and FXI(C321S,H343A) existed in monomer/dimer equilibrium (K(d) approximately 40 nm), all other mutants were predominantly monomers with impaired dimer formation by analytical ultracentrifugation (K(d)=3-38 microm). When converted to the active enzyme, FXIa, all the monomeric mutants activated FIX similarly to wild-type dimeric FXIa. In contrast, these monomeric mutants could not be activated efficiently by FXIIa, thrombin, or autoactivation in the presence of dextran sulfate. We conclude that salt bridges formed between Lys-331 of one subunit and Glu-287 of the other together with hydrophobic interactions at the interface, involving residues Ile-290, Leu-284, and Tyr-329, are essential for homodimer formation. The dimeric structure of FXI is essential for normal proteolytic activation of FXI by FXIIa, thrombin, or FXIa either in solution or on an anionic surface but not for FIX activation by FXIa in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2155490673,"Although structural studies on the ligand-binding domain (LBD) have established the general mode of nuclear receptor (NR)/coactivator interaction, determinants of binding specificity are only partially understood. The LBD of estrogen receptor-α (ERα), for example, interacts only with a region of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (PGC)-1α, which contains the canonical LXXLL motif (NR box2), whereas the LBD of estrogen-related receptor-α (ERRα) also binds efficiently an untypical, LXXYL-containing region (NR box3) of PGC-1α. Surprisingly, in a previous structural study, the ERα LBD has been observed to bind NR box3 of transcriptional intermediary factor (TIF)-2 untypically via LXXYL, whereas the ERRα LBD binds this region of TIF-2 only poorly. Here we present a new crystal structure of the ERRα LBD in complex with a PGC-1α box3 peptide. In this structure, residues N-terminal of the PGC-1α LXXYL motif formed contacts with helix 4, the loop connecting helices 8 and 9, and with the C terminus of the ERRα LBD. Interaction studies using wild-type and mutant PGC-1α and ERRα showed that these contacts are functionally relevant and are required for efficient ERRα/PGC-1α interaction. Furthermore, a structure comparison between ERRα and ERα and mutation analyses provided evidence that the helix 8–9 loop, which differs significantly in both nuclear receptors, is a major determinant of coactivator binding specificity. Finally, our results revealed that in ERRα the helix 8–9 loop allosterically links the LBD homodimer interface with the coactivator cleft, thus providing a plausible explanation for distinct PGC-1α binding to ERRα monomers and homodimers.

It exhibits a canonical three-layered “α-helical sandwich” fold generally composed of 12 α-helices (H1–H12) and a β-sheet. Binding of activating ligand (agonist) to the LBD triggers conformational changes that result in coactivator (CoA) recruitment. CoAs typically interact with the LBD via a short α-helix containing a LXXLL sequence motif, also termed the NR box (4Savkur R.S. Burris T.P. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The leucine residues of this motif form hydrophobic contacts with the so-called CoA cleft of the LBD, which is constituted by H3, H4, and H12. Binding of the LXXLL helix is further stabilized by a “charge clamp” interaction with two conserved, charged residues of the LBD (lysine or arginine in H3 and glutamate in H12). Numerous proteins are recruited to the agonist-bound NR LBD including CBP/p300, the p160 CoAs (steroid receptor coactivator-1, transcriptional intermediary factor(TIF)-2, activator of thyroid and retinoid receptor), the p220 subunit of the DRIP·TRAP·Mediator complex (5Lonard D.M.

The large number of potentially interacting NRs and CoAs, and the relatively small interaction surface constituted by the CoA cleft and the LXXLL helix, have raised the question how selective binding is achieved (18Darimont B.D. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 675-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Several examples of preferential or selective NR/CoA interaction have been documented. Early work showed that residues flanking the LXXLL motif can contribute to binding specificity (19Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J.

Furthermore, the binding preference of the LBD of the glucocorticoid receptor or constitutive androstane receptor for the third LXXLL motif (NR box3) of TIF-2 appears to result from a second charge clamp interaction between CoA cleft residues and charged residues at positions + 2 and +6 (relative to the first leucine residue) of the box3 motif (21Bledsoe R.K.

In comparison, multiple features account for selective repression of liver receptor homolog-1 activity by a small heterodimer partner; key residues in the CoA cleft, orientation of the main chain C-terminal of H12, and the precise positioning of H12 affecting the shape of the CoA cleft (23Li Y. Choi M. Suino K. Kovach A. Daugherty J. Kliewer S.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9505-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The understanding of CoA binding selectivity is further complicated by the observation that some NRs, such as ERRα or androgen receptor, can interact with the untypical motifs LLKYL or FXXLF, respectively (17Huss J.M.

Although the binding preference of FXXLF peptides for androgen receptor was reported to be determined solely by CoA cleft residues that differ between steroid hormone receptors (25He B.

Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Importantly, PGC-1α interacts only with ERRα homodimers but not with monomers (26Barry J.B. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A previously reported crystal structure of the ERRα LBD in complex with a PGC-1α box3 peptide shows that the untypical motif binds in an α-helical conformation (like LXXLL peptides), with the exception that Leu(+4) is replaced by tyrosine (27Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49330-49337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Such a LXXYL binding mode has already been observed earlier in the crystal structure of the ERα LBD complexed with a TIF-2 box3 peptide (28Warnmark A. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Hubbard R.E. Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21862-21868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because of a particular amino acid composition (LLRYLL), the TIF-2 box3 region has the potential to interact with NRs in either a canonical (LXXLL) or an untypical (LXXYL) manner. However, based on additional functional studies, it was concluded that untypical binding to ERα may be favored by the crystal packing and that in solution TIF-2 box3 likely interacts via LXXLL (28Warnmark A.

Together, these observations raise the question as to what determines efficient binding of the LXXYL region of PGC-1α box3 (but not of TIF-2 box3) to ERRα (but not to ERα). ERRs are known to interfere with ER signaling in tissues where the receptors are coexpressed (29Zhang Z. Teng C.T. Mol. Cell.

Here we present a structural and functional analysis of PGC-1α binding to the ERRα LBD, which is based on a comparison between our new crystal structure of the ERRα LBD complexed with a PGC-1α box3 peptide at 2.1 Å resolution and previously presented ERRα/PGC-1α box3 and ERα/TIF-2 box3 structures (27Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol.

We co-crystallized the ERRα LBD with a “wild-type” PGC-1α box3 peptide (198QQQKPQRRPCSELLKYLTTNDD219), whereas in the case of the reported structure (27Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I.

In our crystal structure, residues N-terminal of the LXXYL motif form additional contacts with the ERRα surface, notably with H4, the H8-H9 loop, and the C terminus of the LBD. Through extensive functional interaction studies using wild-type and mutant forms of PGC-1α, ERRα, and ERα, we provide evidence that the contacts between N-terminal flanking residues of PGC-1α and the H8-H9 loop of ERRα are a major determinant of coactivator binding specificity. Furthermore, our results show that the H8-H9 loop allosterically links the homodimer interface with the CoA cleft, providing a plausible explanation for distinct PGC-1α binding of ERRα monomers and homodimers. Construction of Recombinant Plasmids—cDNA fragments encoding wild-type or mutant human ERRα LBD (residues 189–423) (GenBank™ accession number NP_004442) and human ERα LBD (residues 307–548) were generated by PCR. The wild-type ERRα cDNA fragment was cloned at the BamHI/NotI sites of a modified pET-24d expression plasmid (Novagen) in which the T7 tag had been replaced by a hexahistidine (His) tag (MRSHHHHHHGPGLVPRGS). Wild-type and mutant cDNA fragments of ERRα and ERα were also cloned at the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCMX-VP16, resulting in fusion with the VP16 transactivation domain. Similarly, cDNA fragments encoding wild-type or mutant NR interacting regions of human PGC-1α or human TIF-2 were generated by PCR and cloned at the BamHI or EcoRI/BamHI sites of pCMX-Gal4, resulting in fusion with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147). The coding region of full-length human ERRα was cloned by PCR at the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pCMX-K·ATG containing a Kozak sequence 5′ to an ATG start codon and the multiple cloning site. ERRα mutants were subcloned into pCMX-K·ATG from the corresponding pCMX-VP16 plasmids using an internal SpeI site and a 3′ BamHI site present in both pCMX vectors. The coding sequence for PGC-1α interaction domain (ID) and PGC-1α ID(L144A/L210A) was subcloned from pCMX-Gal4 at the BamHI site of a modified pET15b plasmid (Novagen) containing the coding sequence for glutathione S-transferase (GST) 5′ of the hexahistidine tag sequence. A detailed description of the cloning of all plasmids is available upon request. Protein Production and Purification—The His-tagged ERRα LBD (residues 189–423) was produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cultures were grown in Terrific Broth medium at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.4 was reached. The temperature was then decreased to 18 °C, and cultures were induced at an A600 of 0.8 overnight with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Harvested bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl. After sonication of the bacterial cells and ultracentrifugation the tagged ERRα, LBD was purified by affinity chromatography using a NiSO4-loaded HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) and by gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein (estimated purity, >95%) was concentrated to about 10 mg/ml in gel filtration buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. GST-PGC-1α ID and GST-PGC-1α ID(L144A/L210A) fusion proteins were produced at 37 °C in E. coli BL21(DE3) using a pET15b-GST expression plasmid. The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) 100 mm NaCl. Protein Complex Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Crystallization trials were carried out in the presence of a 3-fold molar excess of PGC-1α box3 peptide (198QQQKPQRRPCSELLKYLTTNDD219). Crystals of the ERRα LBD/PGC-1α box3 complex were obtained at 17 °C by vapor diffusion in sitting drops. Reservoir solutions contained 0.1 m bis-Tris (pH 5.5), 15% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.2 m Mg(NO3)2. Crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (beamline ID 14-2) in Grenoble. Crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with one homodimer per asymmetric unit. Data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Individual B-atomic factors were refined anisotropically. Solvent molecules were then placed according to unassigned peaks in the difference Fourier maps. The final model, refined at 2.1 Å with no σ cutoff, contains for ERRα (subunit A in the PDB file) 209 residues (194–212, 223–365, 374–420), or (subunit C) 216 residues (192–213, 223–367, 375–423), for PGC-1α (subunit B) 13 residues (205–217) or (subunit D) 14 residues (205–218), and 272 water molecules. According to PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

A, mammalian two-hybrid interaction assay of PGC-1α ID, box2, and box3 with ERRα mutants. Residues that differ between the CoA clefts of ERRα and ERα have been exchanged in the mutant ERRα(M258V-Q262E). In the mutant ERRα(Δ3C), the three C-terminal residues (Met-421 to Asp-423) have been deleted. The single point mutants ERRα(H341A) and ERRα(D423A) probe the relevance of a hydrogen bond between the side chains of these residues observed in subunit C of the asymmetric unit. Transient transfection assays in COS-1 cells were performed as described for Fig. 2. Bars represent the mean ± S.D. (n ≥ 6). p values were calculated for ERRα mutants relative to the corresponding values of wild-type ERRα(**, p ≤ 0.0001; *, p ≤ 0.001). B, schematic representation of selected parts of the ERRα CoA cleft and the homodimer interface. The H8–H9 loop lies within the proximity of the CoA cleft and is directly contacted by N-terminal flanking residues of PGC-1α. The H8–H9 loop links via multiple hydrogen bonds the homodimer interface with the CoA cleft. C, ERRα mutants probing the contribution of the H8–H9 loop to PGC-1α binding. In ERRα(SwapH8–H9) the H8–H9 loop region (amino acids 338–341) has been replaced with the corresponding region of ERα (amino acids 457–468). In ERRα(S259H) the serine residue has been mutated to the corresponding residue of ERα. Transient transfection assays in COS-1 cells were performed as described for Fig. 2.

A, amino acid sequence alignment of selected parts of the ERRα and the ERα LBD. Residues involved in CoA binding are colored blue; amino acids that differ between the CoA cleft of ERRα and ERα are underlined. Regions that differ significantly between the two receptors (H8–H9 loop and C terminus) and that have been exchanged in the respective swap mutants are colored red. B, superimposition of the CoA cleft and the H8–H9 loop region of ERRα and ERα (PDP ID: 1QKU). H9 is longer in ERα, and the H8–H9 loop adopts a different conformation. Only selected residues that have been mutated are depicted. C, superimposition of the H8–H9 loop region of ERα with the corresponding part of ERRα (molecule coloring as in B). The representation illustrates that swapping of the H8–H9 loop of ERα into ERRα perturbs the homodimer interface and requires conformational adaptations of side chains, mainly because of the presence of the bulky Tyr-459. D, ERα mutants probing the contribution of residues to PGC-1α binding (E2, estradiol). In ERα(V376M-E380Q), residues that differ in the CoA of ERα and ERRα have been exchanged. In ERα(SwapH8–H9), the H8–H9 loop region (amino acids 457–468) has been replaced with the corresponding region (amino acids 338–341) of ERRα. ERα(3mut) corresponds to V376M-E380Q-SwapH8–H9-H373S-H377S. In ERα(4mut), His-547—Arg-548 of ERα have, in addition, been replaced with Met-421—Met-422—Asp-423 of ERRα. Mammalian two-hybrid interaction assays were done in BHK cells using Gal4(5)-TATA-LUC, pCMX-Gal4-PGC-1α constructs, and wild-type or mutant pCMX-VP16-ERRα LBD.

In particular, the endonexin sequence, which is responsible for coordination of calcium ions in type II binding sites, is only partially conserved in plant annexins. The crystal structure of calcium-bound cotton annexin Gh1 was solved at 2.5Å resolution and shows three metal ions coordinated in the first and fourth repeat in types II and III binding sites. Although the protein has no detectable affinity for calcium in solution, in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, we determined a stoichiometry of four calcium ions per protein molecule using isothermal titration calorimetry. Further analysis of the crystal structure showed that binding of a fourth calcium ion is structurally possible in the DE loop of the first repeat. Data from this study are in agreement with the canonical membrane binding of annexins, which is facilitated by the convex surface associating with the phospholipid bilayer by a calcium bridging mechanism. In annexin Gh1, this membrane-binding state is characterized by four calcium bridges in the I/IV module of the protein and by direct interactions of several surface-exposed basic and hydrophobic residues with the phospholipid membrane. Analysis of the protein fold stability revealed that the presence of calcium lowers the thermal stability of plant annexins. Furthermore, an additional unfolding step was detected at lower temperatures, which can be explained by the anchoring of the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal core by two conserved hydrogen bonds.

In all kingdoms, annexins share the three-dimensional fold consisting of an N-terminal tail of variable length and a C-terminal core that contains a 4-fold repeat (I-IV) of a 70-amino acid sequence. Structurally, each repeat consists of a four-helix bundle (A, B, D, E) and a fifth helix (helix C) almost perpendicular to the bundle underneath. Many biochemical and histological properties are shared among all annexins because of this structural conservation, although differences have also been observed (1Hofmann A. Huber R. Bandorowicz-Pikula J Annexins: Biological importance and annexin-related pathologies. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2003: 38-60Crossref Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent binding to acidic phospholipid membranes has been a landmark feature of annexins, due to the presence of canonical calcium binding sites provided by the endonexin sequence KGXGT38(D/E) (2Geisow M. Fritsche U. Hexham J. Dash B. Johnson T. Nature. 1986; 320: 636-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In animal annexins, this motif is present in three or four repeats of the C-terminal core and localizes to the convex and membrane-binding side of the slightly curved protein. Although plant annexins have been implicated in a variety of physiological processes, the assignment of individual and detailed roles awaits further elucidation. The involvement of annexin D1 from Arabidopsis thaliana in oxidative stress response has been reported (3Gidrol X. Sabelli P. Fern Y. Kush A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11268-11273Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and has been hypothesized for cotton annexin Gh1 (4Hofmann A. Delmer D.P. Wlodawer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2557-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Medicago sativa, annexin Ms2 is up-regulated upon environmental stress such as drought and osmotic stress (5Kovacs I.

Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar), have been proposed. Using Arabidopsis seedlings, a role for annexins in differential growth during gravitropism has been implied (11Clark G. Cantero-Garcia A. Butterfield T. Dauwalder M. Roux S. Grav. Space Biol. 2005; 18: 113-114PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations further suggest a link between plant annexins and polysaccharide synthesis, an important factor of the plant response to infection and wounding. Annexins from Lilium longiflorum and A. thaliana are involved in Golgi-mediated secretion of polysaccharides (12Blackbourn H. Barker P. Huskisson N. Battey N.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1072-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cotton annexins have been found to co-purify with callose synthase (1,3-β-glucan synthase) (14Andrawis A. Solomon M. Delmer D. Plant J. 1993; 3: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Shin H.S. Brown R.M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Shin H.

Plant J. 1993; 3: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The discovery of an unusual sulfur cluster in the crystal structure of annexin Gh1, and its conservation in many plant annexins, fueled the hypothesis of a redox regulation of cellulose synthase by the annexin (4Hofmann A.

The recent discovery of an oomycete annexin that acts as an activator of callose synthase adds further weight to this notion (19Bouzenzana J. Pelosi L. Briolay A. Briolay J. Bulone V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ever since plant annexins were introduced to the wider annexin family (20Blackbourn H. Walker J. Battey N.

Furthermore, the existence of calcium-dependent and -independent protein-membrane interactions have been observed with bell pepper and cotton annexins, and three conserved surface-exposed residues on the convex side of the molecule have been identified as regulators of the calcium-independent membrane binding (31Dabitz N. Hu N.J. Yusof A.M. Tranter N. Winter A. Daley M. Zschörnig O. Brisson A. Hofmann A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16292-16300Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although crystal structures of plant annexins from Capsicum annuum, Gossypium hirsutum, and A. thaliana have been determined, none were obtained in the presence of calcium. Therefore, it remains unclear which calcium binding sites are utilized by plant annexins. The endonexin sequence constitutes the type II calcium binding sites, where the coordination sphere of calcium typically is a pentagonal bipyramid with a backbone carbonyl oxygen and a water molecule in the apical positions. Another water molecule, three backbone carbonyl groups, and the acidic residue from the conserved motif form the base of the bipyramid. In contrast, type III and AB′ sites involve one or two backbone carbonyl groups with a bidentate acidic residue nearby. The coordination sphere of calcium in these sites is completed by several water molecules. The type III binding sites are observed in the DE loops of the annexin repeats. In annexin B12, intermolecular calcium coordination bridging two annexin monomers in a head-to-head arrangement has been observed (32Luecke H. Chang B. Mailliard W. Schlaepfer D. Haigler H. Nature. 1995; 378: 446-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, the calcium-bound structure of α-11 giardin from Giardia lamblia revealed a new binding site (type IIIb) in the DE loop of repeat I, where the metal ion is coordinated by three backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Lys-53, Ile-56, and Lys-57, as well as side chain oxygen atoms from Asn-58 and Glu-62 (mono-dentate) (33Pathuri P. Nguyen E.T. Svard S.G. Luecke H. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although in three of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit, the calcium is coordinated as an intermolecular ligand, one monomer possesses an intramolecular calcium in which two water molecules complete the coordination sphere of a pentagonal bipyramid. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of cotton annexin Gh1 in the presence of calcium, providing, for the first time, insights into the structural constituents of plant annexin calcium binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we determined the calcium stoichiometry of annexin Gh1 in the membrane-bound state. Thermal denaturation experiments revealed the destabilization of cotton and bell pepper annexins in the presence of calcium in solution, an observation that is highly unusual. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein—The wild-type and fusion proteins used in this study were cloned and purified as described previously (25Hofmann A. Proust J. Dorowski A. Schantz R.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Native crystals of recombinant annexin Gh1 were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using a reservoir solution of 1.7 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0) (4Hofmann A. Delmer D.P. Wlodawer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2557-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Droplets consisted of 2 μl of protein solution (25 mg/ml) and 2 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals were obtained after about 4 weeks at 290 K. Initially, soaking and co-crystallization of native crystals were attempted in the presence of 1-15 mm CaCl2. A fine grid search around these conditions was conducted by adjusting the concentrations of the precipitant as well as the buffer pH. Because of the formation of insoluble calcium sulfate at calcium concentrations of more than 30 mm, subsequent co-crystallization trials with higher concentrations of calcium (50 and 100 mm) were carried out with in-house screening buffers containing no ammonium sulfate. Crystals of calcium-bound annexin Gh1 were obtained from 1.6 m KH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 6.0) and 50 mm CaCl2. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Crystals were cryoprotected with 25% glycerol, and diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beam line BM14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data sets were indexed using the program MOSFLM, version 6.2.3 (35Leslie A. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26: 26-30Google Scholar). Intensities were scaled and merged with SCALA from the CCP4 package (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Unit cell parameters and data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (37Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2557-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Residues in the loop regions were substituted for alanine for the Patterson search. Structure refinement with REFMAC (38Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) used initial rigid body refinement and subsequent rounds of positional, grouped, and individual B-factor refinement. A constant bulk solvent model was applied throughout the procedure. 5% of the data were used to calculate an Rfree factor. The initial model was visually inspected and manually corrected with COOT (39Emsley P. Cowton K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the loop regions were rebuilt unambiguously using OMIT electron density maps. The final geometry was assessed with PROCHECK (40Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl.

The preparation procedure follows that of Pagano and Weinstein (41Pagano R. Weinstein J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 435-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Appropriate amounts of DMPC and DMPS (mol 3:1) were transferred to a round-bottom test tube and dissolved thoroughly in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). A stream of nitrogen was applied to evaporate the organic solvent. The resulting thin lipid film was then placed in a vacuum for 12 h to eliminate residual traces of organic solvent. Aqueous buffer was then added to the test tube to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml phospholipids and vortexed at 35 °C to free the lipid molecules from the test tube, thus producing a milky multilamellar vesicle solution. Subsequently, bath sonication was performed to disperse the multilamellar vesicles and convert them to SUVs. A gentle nitrogen stream was also employed to avoid oxidative degradation of the lipids during sonication. The temperature of the sonication bath was kept at 4 °C during the whole process. The preparation of SUVs was complete when the lipid solution adopted a clear, slightly blue color. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Calcium binding of annexin Gh1 in the absence and presence of DMPC/DMPS (molar ratio 3:1) was assessed using an isothermal titration calorimeter VP-ITC from MicroCal. All solutions were degassed. Samples were placed into the calorimetry cell (volume: 1.4 ml); the titration syringe contained a solution of 50 mm CaCl2 in the absence of vesicles and 5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of vesicles, respectively. All samples were prepared in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The concentration of annexin Gh1 was 75 μm in the absence and 25 μm in the presence of lipid vesicles. For experiments with vesicles, the final amount of lipids was 7.5 mg/ml. The experiments were performed at 25 °C by titration of 5-μl portions. For every titration a reference experiment was carried out by titrating calcium into a sample without protein. Analysis was performed offline using the program Origin (MicroCal) with a special module for ITC data treatment. The heat release was calculated by integrating each titration spike. The difference of heat release between the regular and reference experiments was plotted against the molar ratio, x = n(Ca2+)/n(protein). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Thermal denaturation of proteins was monitored by CD spectroscopy using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier element. CD spectra of a sample of 3 μm protein in 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) were recorded at different temperatures in the absence and presence of calcium (10 mm). Before each run, the sample was equilibrated at the respective temperature for 20 min. The effect of calcium on the secondary structure was assessed by collecting CD spectra at 20 °C and at different calcium concentrations. All experiments were carried out three times independently. Using the software program ACDP (42Hofmann A. Wlodawer A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 209-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Hu N. Currid M. Daley M. Hofmann A. Appl. Spectrosc. 2005; 59 (abst): 68AGoogle Scholar), each protein spectrum was corrected with a buffer spectrum acquired at the same temperature and then transformed into mean residue ellipticity. Changes in the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm were used to construct an unfolding curve. Curve fitting of an appropriate range of data was done using a sigmoid equation in SigmaPlot (SPSS, Inc.). Crystal Structure of Calcium-bound Annexin Gh1—Determination of the calcium-bound cotton annexin Gh1 crystal structure was possible only by exchanging the major precipitant from sulfate to phosphate salts and rather high calcium concentrations. Although soaking the protein crystals with high calcium concentrations cracked the crystals and rendered them unusable, co-crystallization at high levels of calcium required precipitants other than sulfate salts. At low calcium concentrations, the crystal shape is triangular prism-like, and the size of crystals decrease with increasing calcium concentrations (see Fig. 1). Crystals of annexin Gh1 obtained under phosphate conditions in the presence of 50 mm calcium appear as long rods. This apparent change in the crystal shape is reflected by the change in space group from P3112 to P321, and the change in unit cell dimensions in data set GH1_26. The crystallographic 3-fold symmetry leads to three annexin molecules packed tightly in the same plane with the contact interfaces provided by the IAB and IIAB loops of symmetry-related molecules. The crystallographic 2-fold axis creates an interaction interface formed by helices IID, IIE, and IIIA. In data set GH1_26, three peaks in the electron density indicate the presence of calcium ions (see Fig. 2 and Table 2). In the IAB loop, a calcium ion (CA1) is coordinated with pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Three carbonyl oxygen atoms (Phe-29, Gly-31, Gly-33), the bidentate carboxylate of Glu-73, and a water molecule provide the coordination of a type II binding site as anticipated earlier (30Hofmann A. Annexins. 2004; 1: 51-61Google Scholar). The apical ligand of CA1 is provided by the carbonyl oxygen of Trp-104 from the IIAB loop of a symmetry-related molecule generated by the 3-fold axis. The involvement of Trp-104 in calcium coordination distorts the backbone geometry of Trp-104 (φ= 70°, ψ =-90°) and Thr-105 (φ=-170°, ψ = 40°) from the standard parameters (44Engh R. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar), thus making these residues the outliers in the Ramachandran plot. Another calcium ion (CA2) is bound in the IVAB loop, which has moved closer to the IVDE loop when compared with the crystal structure of the apo-protein. Coordination for CA2 is provided by three backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms (Ile-259, Arg-261, Gly-263) and the bidentate carboxylate of Asp-303, thus constituting a trigonal-biypramidal geometry. This coordination geometry of a type II binding site has been observed earlier in other annexin crystal structures (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1avh, 1aii, 1xjl) (45Huber R. Berendes R.

D. 2002; 58: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A third calcium ion (CA3) is bound in the IVDE loop and coordinated by two carbonyl oxygen atoms (Val-301, Thr-304), the bidentate carboxylate of Glu-309, two water molecules, and a phosphate ion acting as a monodentate ligand. CA3 thus occupies a type III binding site.TABLE 2Calcium coordination geometryBinding siteTypeCoordinationBackbone carbonylsBidentate side chainsSolventCA1 IABII7Phe-29: 2.37; Gly-31: 2.58; Gly-33: 2.53; Trp-104′: 2.41Glu-73: 3.04 (OE1), 2.71 (OE2)HOH-3: 2.93CA2 IVABII5Ile-259: 2.56; Arg-261: 2.12; Gly-263: 2.12Asp-303: 2.44 (OD1), 2.78 (OD2)CA3 IVDEIII7Val-301: 2.15; Thr-304: 2.67Glu-309: 2.91 (OE1), 3.00 (OE2)HOH-96: 2.96; HOH-134: 2.38; PO43: 2.50 (O-4) Open table in a new tab Superposition of the current structure with other structures of apo-plant annexins shows the usual conformational divergence with r.m.s.d. of 2.4-3.0 Å. Compared with the structure of apo-annexin Gh1 (r.m.s.d. = 1.3 Å), the only significant conformational differences occur in loops IAB, IDE, IIAB, IVAB, and IVDE (see Fig. 3). Loop IVAB moves closer toward loop IVDE, with Thr-264 relocating by 9 Å. The second-most significant movement is observed in loop IIAB, where Trp-104 moves about 5 Å and the guanidinyl group of Arg-103 by about 7 Å. The semi-sheltered position of Trp-104 in the apo-structure, where Arg-103 shields the tryptophan residue, has changed to fully expose Trp-104 and Arg-103. The carbonyl oxygen of Trp-104 relocates by 8 Å to participate in the coordination of a calcium ion in the first repeat of a symmetry-related molecule. Within the first repeat, less rearrangement is observed upon calcium binding. Glu-73 moves downward, and the backbone of Trp-32 moves toward the IDE loop, each by 2 Å. Occupation of the type III binding site in the IVDE loop leads to a slight repositioning of the backbone carbonyl groups of residues 301 and 304 by 2.5 and 1.5 Å, respectively. Neither of the two exposed tryptophan residues is harbored in a predominantly hydrophobic pocket. The conjugated π-electron system of Trp-32 is in stacking conformation with Arg-80 from the top part of the IE helix of a neighboring molecule, indicating hydrogen bonding. The side chain of Trp-104 faces a pocket presented by Lys-66, Ala-69, Lys-72, and Glu-73 from another symmetry-related molecule. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—In the absence of phospholipid vesicles, no significant enthalpy change was detected when titrating calcium into a sample of annexin Gh1 over a wide range of molar ratios (Fig. 4). This agrees with the CD spectra analysis of annexin Gh1 at various calcium concentrations (0 to 9 mm) where no significant changes in the signal at 222 nm are observed (data not shown). Thus, there is no association of calcium ions with cotton annexin Gh1 in solution. A similar phenomenon is well known for several animal annexins, which show only a low affinity for calcium in the absence of phospholipid membranes (48Patel D.R. Jao C.C. Mailliard W.S. Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7054-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Patel D.R. Isas J.M. Ladokhin A.S. Jao C.C. Kim Y.E. Kirsch T. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2833-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of DMPC/DMPS (3:1) vesicles, annexin Gh1 titration with calcium exhibited downward spikes, indicating an exothermic reaction after each titration event. A plot of the heat release as a function of the molar ratio revealed a graph that could be fit with a model of one set of binding sites (Fig. 4). The fit parameters reveal a stoichiometry of 4.35 ± 0.154 mol of calcium/1 mol of annexin Gh1. The apparent dissociation constant for the ternary complex annexin Gh1·Ca2+·membrane is kd = 11 μm. This results in a c-value for the ITC profile of 9.08, which is near the lower edge of the experimental window. Stability Measurements—The stability of"
https://openalex.org/W2050517433,"Solar ultraviolet A (UVA) (320–400 nm) radiation-induced gene expression in keratinocytes is initiated at the level of the cell membrane via generation of singlet oxygen and subsequent formation of ceramide from sphingomyelin. We now report that the UVA response also involves raft signaling and that ceramide and raft signaling are linked with each other. Upon UVA irradiation, the lipid composition of rafts decreased 40% in sphingomyelin and 60% in cholesterol (Chol). Also, decrease of Chol increased the susceptibility towards UVA-induced gene expression, whereas increase of Chol completely abolished their capacity to generate signaling ceramides and to mount the subsequent UVA response. This inhibition was not associated with UVA-induced Chol oxidation and was also seen after treatment of cells with plant sterols. The UVA responsiveness depended on the ratio of Chol versus ceramide in rafts. A ratio smaller than 1 permitted initiation and transduction of the signaling response, whereas a ratio greater than 1, for example, upon sterol pretreatment, abolished this response, indicating that UVA radiation-induced ceramide signaling is controlled by the lipid composition of rafts."
https://openalex.org/W2081698089,"Decapping is an important process in the control of eukaryotic mRNA degradation. The scavenger decapping enzyme DcpS functions to clear the cell of cap structure following decay of the RNA body by catalyzing the hydrolysis of m7GpppN to m7Gp and ppN. Structural analysis has revealed that DcpS is a dimeric protein with a domain-swapped amino terminus. The protein dimer contains two cap binding/hydrolysis sites and displays a symmetric structure with both binding sites in the open conformation in the ligand-free state and an asymmetric conformation with one site open and one site closed in the ligand-bound state. The structural data are suggestive of a dynamic decapping mechanism where each monomer could alternate between an open and closed state. Using transient state kinetic studies, we show that both the rate-limiting step and rate of decapping are regulated by cap substrate. A regulatory mechanism is established by the intrinsic domain-swapped structure of the DcpS dimer such that the decapping reaction is very efficient at low cap substrate concentrations yet regulated with excess cap substrate. These data provide biochemical evidence to verify experimentally a dynamic and mutually exclusive cap hydrolysis activity of the two cap binding sites of DcpS and provide key insights into its regulation.

The control of mRNA degradation is a critical step in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, and the steady state level of any mRNA species depends on both the rate of mRNA synthesis and its breakdown. In eukaryotic cells, cytoplasmic mRNA degradation proceeds predominantly through an initial removal of the polyadenylated tail (1Decker C.J. Parker R.

The resulting capped oligonucleotide m7GpppN(pN)n (n < 9) is hydrolyzed by a second type of decapping enzyme, DcpS, to release the m7Gp and ppN(pN)n products (12Wang Z. Kiledjian M.

DcpS, which was originally characterized as the decapping enzyme in the 3′–5′ pathway, is also able to hydrolyze the 5′–3′ decapping product m7Gpp to release m7Gp (16Chen N. Walsh M.A. Liu Y.

Each DcpS monomer possesses a distinct N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain containing the HIT motif linked by a hinge region. The N-terminal domain displays a domain-swapped form by exchanging an identical α-helix and two antiparallel β-strands with the second monomer. The DcpS homodimer contains two cap binding pockets, which serve as the active sites for cap hydrolysis. In the ligand-bound form, DcpS forms a closed conformation on one side and an open conformation on the other, with substrate bound at the C-terminal domain of each side (24Gu M. Fabrega C. Liu S.W. Liu H. Kiledjian M. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 67-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The structure suggests that the closed conformation constitutes the cap hydrolysis productive site, whereas the open site would be nonproductive. The N-terminal domains can both be in the open state, or one side can be in an open state with the second in a productive closed state with the hinge enabling the N terminus to flip back and forth, alternating on each side (16Chen N.

Here, we examined the enzyme kinetics of DcpS and demonstrate substrate binding and hydrolysis are regulated by negative cooperativity. Furthermore, by comparing the enzymatic behaviors of the wild type homodimer of DcpS and HIT mutant heterodimer, we biochemically confirm and expand upon the previously proposed dynamic mechanism of decapping implied by the structural analysis (16Chen N.

Plasmid Constructs—The pcDNA3-FLAG-DcpS plasmid, which expresses FLAG-tagged DcpS in HEK293T cells, was constructed by inserting the DcpS open reading frame flanked by a BamHI site at the 5′-end and an XhoI site at the 3′-end into the pcDNA3-FLAG vector (25Fenger-Gron M. Fillman C. Norrild B. Lykke-Andersen J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A second FLAG-tagged DcpS expression plasmid, pcDNA3-FLAG-DcpS-2, was constructed by inserting the DcpS open reading frame with a FLAG tag fragment at the 5′ of the open reading frame into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids expressing a series of double-tagged homodimer and heterodimer proteins were generated by inserting two corresponding tagged wild-type or mutated DcpS open reading frames into the two multiple cloning regions of the commercial plasmid pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Plasmid pETDuet1-His-DcpS/FLAG-DcpS was constructed by inserting the NcoI (Klenow-filled)/XhoI restriction fragment from pcDNA3-FLAG-DcpS-2, as well as the NcoI/XhoI (Klenow-filled) restriction fragment from pET28-DcpS (13Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), into the EcoRV/XhoI sites and NcoI/EcoRI (Klenow-filled) sites in pET-Duet-1, respectively. Plasmids pETDuet1-His-DcpSH277N/FLAG-DcpS and pETDuet1-His-DcpSW175AFLAG-DcpSN110A were constructed in a similar way, except with the indicated mutated sites introduced into the DcpS open reading frame. The mutagenesis of DcpS H277N was described in Ref. 13Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar. The mutagenesis of N110A and W175A was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the primer sets 5′-CTC CAA TTG CAG TTC TCC GCT GAT ATA TAC AGC ACC TAT C-3′ and 5′-GAT AGG TGC TGT ATA TAT CAG CGG AGA ACT GCA ATT GGA G-3′ (for N110A) and 5′-CAG AGC CTC AGC ATC CAG GCG GTG TAT AAC ATT CTC GAC-3′ and 5′-GTC GAG AAT GTT ATA CAC CGC CTG GAT GCT GAG GCT CTG-3′ (for W175A). The single-tagged homodimer proteins His-DcpSBC/BC and FLAG-DcpSBC/BC were used in Fig. 4C and contain the N110A and W175A double mutations. They were expressed from plasmids pET28-DcpSN110A/W175A and pcDNA3-FLAG-DcpSN110A/W175A, respectively. These two plasmids were generated by introducing the N110A and W175A mutations into the plasmids pET28-DcpS and pcDNA3-FLAG-DcpS-2, respectively, using the primer sets described above. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant FLAG-DcpS was purified from HEK293T cells transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-DcpS by using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). 1 × 108 293T cells were transfected with 120 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-DcpS and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow transient protein overexpression. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were harvested and washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in sonication buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40), followed by sonication for 30 s. The cell debris was then spun down, and the supernatant was incubated with 200 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads at 4 °C for 3 h with mild shaking to allow the FLAG-DcpS protein to bind to the beads. The beads were then washed twice with 10 ml of wash buffer (300 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40). The bound FLAG-DcpS proteins were eluted by 1 ml of elution buffer (wash buffer with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide; Sigma). The eluted proteins were then concentrated by Centricon centrifugal filter columns (Amicon, Bedford, MA). The expression of double-tagged recombinant homodimer and heterodimer proteins was performed using the pETDuet1 expression system. Plasmids pETDuet1-His-DcpS/FLAG-DcpS, pETDuet1-His-DcpSH277N/FLAG-DcpS, and pETDuet1-His-DcpSW175A/FLAG-DcpSN110A were used to transform BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL competent cells (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate the DcpSWT/WT, DcpSWT/HIT, and DcpSWT/BC proteins, respectively. A single colony was picked and grown in 2 liters LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 20 mg/ml chloramphenicol to 0.6 A600 and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 2–3 h. The bacterial cells were then washed and resuspended in binding buffer (300 mm urea, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and sonicated three times for 30 s at 1-min intervals in ice. The cell debris was then spun down, and the cell lysate containing the recombinant homo- or heterodimer proteins was subjected to a two-step affinity purification procedure. The recombinant proteins were first purified on a nickel charged column for His-tagged protein binding, according to the manufacturer, except there was 300 mm urea and 0.5% Triton X-100 included in the binding buffer. The bound His-tagged proteins were eluted in 1.5 ml of elution buffer (500 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) from the nickel column. The eluted proteins were then subjected to the second affinity column. The eluate was slowly added into 15 ml of FLAG immunoprecipitation binding buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with 200 μlof prewashed anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads at 4 °C for 3 h with mild shaking. The bound proteins were then washed with wash buffer and eluted as for FLAG-DcpS proteins. The eluted proteins are His- and FLAG-double-tagged homo- or heterodimers, since they underwent both His and FLAG column purification. They were subsequently concentrated by Centricon centrifugal filter columns (Amicon, Bedford, MA). Recombinant protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry and calculated based on their extinction coefficient (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) obtained from the ExPASY ProtParam Web tool (27Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D.

Due to the relative purity of the protein sample shown in Fig. 1A, the detected absorbance was directly used with the DcpS extinction coefficient to determine the concentration. Protein samples shown in Figs. 3B and 4B contained a copurified bacterial protein, GroEL. Therefore, extinction coefficients of both proteins were used in the calculations, and the corresponding concentrations of the DcpS dimers were determined.FIGURE 3Trapping of cap substrate at the HIT mutant site of DcpSWT/HIT prevents hydrolysis at the WT active site.A, a schematic representation of the double-tagged DcpSWT/HIT heterodimer is shown. The HIT site binds cap structure but is unable to hydrolyze it (24Gu M. Fabrega C. Liu S.W. Liu H. Kiledjian M. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 67-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). B, recombinant DcpSWT/HIT was overexpressed and purified from BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL bacterial cells and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Sypro-Ruby staining. Migration of the DcpSWT/HIT heterodimer is indicated as is the copurifying bacterial GroEL, whose identity was determined by mass spectrometry. C, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to test the ability of DcpSWT/HIT heterodimer to bind 32P-labeled cap analog. The DcpSWT/HIT heterodimer containing two different tags that were used to selectively purify the protein possesses a FLAG-tagged wild type protomer and a His-tagged HIT mutant protomer (lane 3). The His-tagged wild type homodimer was used in lane 2, and His-tagged HIT mutant homodimer was used in lane 4. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions were carried out with 1 μg of the indicated proteins and resolved on a 5.6% polyacrylamide gel. D, the rapid quenched-flow decapping assays of DcpSWT/HIT were carried out under single and multiple turnover conditions and resolved by TLC. Single turnover conditions of 100 nm monomer concentration of enzyme and 10 nm substrate are denoted by the circles. ×, multiple turnover conditions of 100 nm monomer concentration of enzyme and 800 nm substrate. The fractions of generated decapping product in each set of experiments were quantitated and plotted against the reaction times. The data points of the single turnover condition were fit to a biphasic, double exponential curve (Equation 2). The data represented here are an average of two sets of independent experiments carried out on different days. The error bars indicate the data range for each time point of the experiment. The maximal decapping rate of the multiple turnover experiment is lower than 2%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Generation of Cap Structures—Unlabeled, uncapped RNA corresponding to the pcDNA3 polylinker spanning from the SP6 promoter to the T7 promoter (pcP) with 16 guanosines at the 3′-end was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase from a PCR-generated template using the primers 5′-CGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′ and 5′-CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′. Cap-labeled RNA was generated with the vaccinia virus capping enzyme utilizing [α-32P]GTP and S-adenosylmethionine to label the first phosphate within the cap relative to the methylated guanosine (m7G*pppG-), and the RNA was gel-purified as described (28Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Labeled cap structure without the RNA body was generated by treating the cap-labeled RNA with 1 unit of Nuclease P1 (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 37 °C to hydrolyze the RNA body, leaving the intact cap structure as described (12Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In Vitro Decapping Assays and Data Analysis—Decapping assays in Fig. 4C were carried out with the indicated monomer concentrations of proteins and 200 nm cold cap structure (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) added to 32P-labeled cap structure in decapping buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc, 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 s at room temperature. Decapping reactions were terminated by 1.7 n formic acid. An aliquot of each reaction was spotted onto polyethyleneiminecellulose TLC plates (Sigma) that were prerun in H2O and air-dried, and the products were developed with 0.45 m (NH4)2SO4 at room temperature. The TLC plates were air-dried and exposed to PhosphorImager for quantitation. All quantitations were conducted with an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager (Storm860) using ImageQuant-5 software. The decapping assays were conducted on a rapid quenched-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C. DcpS was loaded in one syringe of the quenched-flow apparatus. The cold cap substrate added to radiolabeled cap substrate with defined concentrations as indicated, were loaded in a second syringe. Decapping reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing equal volumes of solutions from both syringes. After the mixtures of enzyme and substrate were incubated for the indicated times, the reactions were quenched by 2.3 n formic acid added from a third syringe. An aliquot of each reaction was spotted onto TLC plates, developed, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager and quantitated as above. The kinetics in Figs. 1C, 2A, and 4D were fit to Equation 1 using SigmaPlot 10.0 software (Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA), Y=Y0+A(1−exp(−kobst))(Eq. 1) where Y represents the fraction of product m7Gp over total substrate, Y0 is the interception representing the fraction of background m7Gp hydrolyzed from the input substrate in the absence of enzyme, A is the fraction of product generated from actual cleavage of enzyme, kobs is the observed rate constant of cap substrate hydrolysis, and t represents the reaction time. The kinetics of DcpSWT/HIT under excess enzyme over substrate (single turnover conditions) in Fig. 3D were fit to Equation 2, Y=Y0+A(1−exp(−kobst))+B(1−exp(−Ct))(Eq. 2) where Y, Y0, A, and kobs represent the same parameters as in Equation 1. B is the amplitude of the second phase in the kinetics, C is the rate constant of the second phase, and t is time. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out by incubating proteins with labeled cap structure in RNA binding buffer (75 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) per reaction on ice for 15 min. The resulting protein-cap complexes were resolved on a 5.6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager. Hydrolysis of Cap Structure by DcpS Is Rate-limiting at the Binding Step under Single Turnover Conditions—To gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which the DcpS scavenger decapping enzyme functions to hydrolyze cap structure, we undertook an enzymatic kinetic analysis of DcpS decapping. To measure the rate of the decapping reaction, in vitro decapping assays were performed under conditions where enzyme concentration was in excess of the substrate concentration (single turnover conditions), and time courses were measured using a rapid chemical quenched-flow apparatus. The DcpS monomer concentration was varied between 20, 50, 100, and 200 nm, and the cap substrate was kept constant at 10 nm and was spiked with α-32P-labeled cap to follow the decapping products and reactants. The label is exclusively at the first phosphate following the methylated guanosine to enable detection of both the cap structure substrate (m7Gp*ppG) and the decapping product (m7Gp*). A Sypro Ruby (Invitrogen)-stained gel of FLAG-tagged DcpS purified from HEK293T cells is shown in Fig. 1A. The kinetics of cap hydrolysis was monitored from 0.1 s to 2 min at 25 °C. The substrate and product were resolved by polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC (Fig. 1B), and the fraction of generated product was plotted against time (Fig. 1C). The kinetics were fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 1) that provided the decapping rate constants at each enzyme concentration (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of the DcpS-catalyzed decapping reaction under single- and multiple-turnover conditionsLow substrate20 nm DcpS50 nm DcpS100 nm DcpS200 nm DcpS10 nm substrateC = 0.094 ± 0.003 s-1, R = 0.905C = 0.243 ± 0.009 s-1, R = 0.93C = 0.735 ± 0.037 s-1, R = 0.969C = 1.288 ± 0.057 s-1, R = 0.939High substrate200 nm substrate400 nm substrate800 nm substrate1600 nm substrate100 nm DcpSI = 9.25 ± 0.038 nm/s, C = 0.093 s-1, R = 0.97I = 8.95 ± 0.068 nm/s, C = 0.09 s-1, R = 0.95I = 9.55 ± 0.099 nm/s, C = 0.096 s-1, R = 0.96I = 9.25 ± 0.79 nm/s, C = 0.093 s-1, R = 0.93 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 1D and summarized in Table 1, the observed decapping rate constants depended on the DcpS concentrations and increased linearly with increasing DcpS. This dependence indicates that the observed rate of decapping is limited by the formation of the initial enzyme-substrate complex (i.e. the binding step is rate-limiting under the conditions used where the enzyme is in excess of substrate). If the rate-limiting step occurred after the enzyme-substrate binding step, increasing the amount of enzyme would have no effect on the observed reaction rate. Thus, the data are consistent with the rate-limiting step being the initial substrate binding step under the conditions of the experiments. We infer from these data that the decapping reaction rate constant is >1.3 s–1 (Table 1). The bimolecular rate constant of substrate binding was obtained from the slope of the line in Fig. 1D and is equal to 6.8 ± 0.6 × 106m–1 s–1. To obtain the apparent dissociation constant (Kd), the amount of m7Gp product produced after the reaction reached equilibrium was plotted against the respective DcpS concentrations (20–200 nm). The saturated amplitudes indicate that the DcpS-cap complex Kd is <20 nm (Fig. 1E), consistent with the Kd of 75 nm we previously reported (29Liu S.W. Jiao X. Liu H. Gu M. Lima C.D. Kiledjian M. RNA. 2004; 10: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Open to Closed Conformational Step Is the Rate-limiting Step under High Substrate Conditions—The above kinetic analysis demonstrates that the binding between DcpS and cap substrate is the rate-limiting step at the concentrations used in the above experiments and where the enzyme is in excess over the substrate. We next tested parameters with excess substrate and limiting enzyme concentrations. The decapping reaction was performed in the rapid chemical quenched-flow apparatus as above, except the DcpS monomer concentration of 100 nm and excess cap substrate concentrations of 200, 400, 800, and 1600 nm were used. The reaction products were resolved by thin layer chromatography as in Fig. 1B and plotted in Fig. 2A. The kinetics of the decapping reaction under these multiple turnover reaction conditions was initially linear, and then as substrate was depleted, the kinetics became nonlinear. The kinetic curves in Fig. 2B were fit to obtain the initial rate of decapping (Table 1). The initial rate (nm/s) was divided by [DcpS] to obtain the psuedo-first order rate constants of decapping, which were plotted against the substrate concentrations (200–1600 nm). As shown in Fig. 2B and Table 1, the increasing amount of cap substrate had no effect on the observed rate constants, which remained constant around 0.1 s–1. This independence of rate on substrate concentration indicates that substrate binding is not rate-limiting. Curiously, this observed rate of decapping under excess substrate conditions is about 109 times lower than what we expect from the rate measurements at 1.6 μm cap substrate under single turnover kinetic conditions. From the measured bimolecular rate constant of substrate binding equal to 6.8 ± 0.6 × 106m–1 s–1 and for 1.6 μm cap substrate concentration, we expect the observed rate constant to be close to 6.8 ± 0.6 × 106m–1 s–1 × 1.6 μm = 10.9 s–1, which is 109 times higher than what we observed (0.1 s–1). The results indicate that there is a change in the rate-limiting step, and the decapping reaction is slower when the cap substrate concentration is higher than the DcpS concentration. To identify the rate-limiting step under conditions of excess cap over DcpS, we examined the presteady state portion of the kinetics of decapping in Fig. 2A. When product release of a reaction is rate-limiting, the reaction proceeds through an initial burst (with an amplitude close to the enzyme concentration) for the first round of substrate turnover. An initial steep slope with a subsequent shallow slope would indicate that the reaction proceeds through an initial rapid burst, but the subsequent rounds of hydrolysis are slower due to a slow release of the product. The amplitude of the initial burst would be close to the active enzyme concentration (which we assume is close to 100 nm, the concentration of DcpS used in these reactions). The observed kinetics at all cap substrate concentrations, however, f"

The activity of purified Cdc7 kinase is significantly stimulated by polyamines such as spermine or spermidine.

Spermine affects both the Km and Vmax of Cdc7 kinase for a minichromosome maintenance (MCM) substrate. We also found that histones, lysine- and arginine-rich basic proteins, can stimulate Cdc7 kinase activity, and a MCM complex in association with histone is a more efficient substrate of Cdc7 than the free MCM complex. These results identify potential cellular inhibitors and stimulators of Cdc7 kinase and suggest that Cdc7 may be another target of cellular polyamines and that histones may stimulate Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of chromatin-bound substrates.

Cdc7 kinase is composed of two subunits, namely Cdc7-related catalytic subunit (Hsk1 in fission yeast) and Dbf4-related activation subunit (Dfp1/Him1 and ASK in fission yeast and in human, respectively (4Masai H.

Cdc7 kinase activity may be regulated during cell cycle, and this may be achieved by regulation of the levels of the proteins (16Oshiro G. Owens J.C. Shellman Y. Sclafani R.A. Li J.J. Mol. Cell.

So far, exogenous stimulators or inhibitors of the Cdc7 kinase are not known. Here we examined effects of positively or negatively charged substances on Cdc7 kinase activity in vitro. The results indicate that Cdc7 kinase is stimulated by positively charged polymers such as spermine or polylysine or histones and is inhibited by negatively charged polymers including nucleic acids. Compound, Plasmid DNA, and Antibodies—Spermidine, spermine, poly-l-glutamic acid, melittin (from honey bee venom), histone (from calf thymus), and histone H1 were from Sigma. Histone, histone H1, histone H2A, histone H2B, histone H3, and histone H4 were purchased also from Roche Applied Science. Poly-l-lysine hydrobromide, protamine sulfate (from salmon), and heparin sodium were from Wako (Tokyo, Japan). Polyuridylic acid, potassium salt, was from ICN Biomedicals Inc. Amino acids and oligopeptides were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). An expression vector, mouse AZ2/p3×FLAG-CMV7.1, was a gift from Drs. Noriyuki Murai and Senya Matsufuji and expresses a full-length AZ2 due to deletion of one thymine residue which corrects the frameshift. Sources of antibodies are as follows: Mcm2 (N19, Santa Cruz) and Cdc2 (PSTAIRE, Santa Cruz); histone H3 (ChIP grade, Abcam) and laminB (M20, Santa Cruz). MCM4 S6T7 antibody, directed against dually phosphorylated MCM4 at serine 6 and threonine 7, was previously described (9Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M.

In Vitro Kinase Assays of Cdc7 Kinase—Standard in vitro kinase assays for Cdc7 and Hsk1 were conducted in 25-μl reactions containing 40 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2–8 mm MgOAc, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1–2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The substrates were mouse MCM2-4-6-7 (0.8 μg) or Mrc1 protein (0.1 μg) for human Cdc7-ASK and for fission yeast Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 complex. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE (59:1). The gels were stained with silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Proteins—GST-fused Cdc7 in a complex with the full-length ASK, reported previously (5Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), or a similar construct generated at Carna Bioscience Inc. was expressed in insect cells and purified as before (5Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cdc7 in a complex with the minimum ASK was generated by coexpression of N-terminal His-tagged Cdc7 and the minimum ASK segment (amino acid residues 171–350) in insect cells. The complex was purified by the nickel column. Mouse MCM2-4-6-7 complex was purified from insect cells as described (37You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). GST-fused Dfp1/Him1 and hemagglutinin-tagged Hsk1 proteins were coexpressed in insect cells, and the kinase was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Similarly, GST-tagged Hsk1 and hemagglutinin-tagged Dfp1/Him1 were coexpressed in insect cells and purified. GST-tagged Hsk1 alone was also similarly expressed and purified. Mrc1, tagged with RGS-penta-His at the N terminus, was expressed in insect cells and purified. 3M. Yokoyama, manuscript in preparation. Transfection, Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analyses, and Cell Extracts—Transfection of 293T cells, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of DNA content, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and preparation of Triton-soluble and -insoluble extracts were conducted as previously described (28Yoshizawa-Sugata N.

Cdc7 Kinase Activity Is Stimulated by Polyamines in Vitro—Previous results indicate that Cdc7 kinase may target serine/threonine residues with an acidic environment (8Cho W.H. Lee Y.J. Kong S.I.

We, therefore, examined effects of various positively or negatively charged compounds on Cdc7 kinase activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1, polyamines such as spermidine and spermine showed significant stimulation of human Cdc7-ASK kinase activity. Maximum (6-fold) stimulation was observed at 1 mm spermidine or spermine at 8 mm MgOAc. Spermine also stimulated fission yeast Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 kinase activity by 4–5 times (Fig. 2), suggesting that polyamine-mediated stimulation of Cdc7 kinase activity may be conserved for different species. Polylysine at 10 μm also showed a 4-fold stimulation, whereas polyglutamate at more than 100 μm inhibited kinase activity almost completely (Fig. 1). These results indicate that positively charged polymers stimulate Cdc7 kinase activity, whereas negatively charged polymers inhibit it.FIGURE 2Effect of spermine on fission yeast Hsk1-Dfp1 ·Him1 kinase activity. Effect of spermine was examined in standard in vitro phosphorylation assays for fission yeast Hsk1 kinase using Mrc1 as substrate. A, Upper panel, autoradiogram; lower panel, silver staining. B, quantification of the results. The Mrc1 protein bands were cut out from the dried gel, and their radioactivity (cpm) was measured. The incorporation in the absence of compounds is taken as 100. Lanes 1–8, with Mrc1; lanes 9 and 10, without Mrc1; lanes 1–6, 9, and 10, with GST-Dfp1/Him1+Hsk1 complex; lanes 7 and 8, without GST-Dfp1/Him1+Hsk1 complex; lanes 1–5, 7, and 9, with spermine; lanes 8 and 10, without spermine. The concentration of spermine was as follows: lane 1, 0.5 mm; lane 2, 1 mm; lane 3, 2 mm; lanes 4, 7, and 9, 5 mm; lane 5, 10 mm. Mrc1 phosphorylation by Hsk1 kinase was significantly stimulated by the addition of spermine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetics of Cdc7 Activation by Spermine—We examined the effect of magnesium concentration on spermine-mediated activation of Cdc7 kinase activity. The optimum concentration of magnesium in the presence and absence of 2.5 mm spermine was 2–5 and 5–10 mm, respectively. More than a 10-fold stimulation by spermine was observed at 2 mm magnesium, whereas the stimulation was about 4-fold at 10 mm magnesium (Fig. 3). This result suggests that Cdc7 kinase activation by spermine may be related to the actions of magnesium. We next titrated Cdc7 kinase in the presence and absence of spermine. At 140 nm Cdc7-ASK, almost 20-fold activation was observed, whereas only 4-fold activation was observed at 560 nm (supplemental Fig. 1). We then measured Km and Vmax for the substrate in the presence and absence of spermine. The substrate in our assays is the MCM2-4-6-7 complex, in which MCM2 and MCM4 are mainly phosphorylated by Cdc7 (5Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Tsuji T. Ficarro S.B. Jiang W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4459-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M. Ishii A. Tanaka T. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Ohtani K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39249-39261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). MCM2-4-6-7 was titrated in reaction mixtures containing 2 mm magnesium (Fig. 4). Km and Vmax for the substrate in the absence of spermine was 390 nm and 0.28 pmol/min, whereas those in the presence of 2.5 mm spermine were 125 nm and 0.85 pmol/min, respectively. Thus, both Km and Vmax for the MCM2-4-6-7 substrate were improved by 3-fold by the presence of spermine. Cdc7 in Complex with Minimum ASK Cannot Be Efficiently Activated by Spermine—Polyamines may stimulate the Cdc7 kinase activity by directly interacting with the kinase complex, as was shown with casein kinase, the β subunit of which interacts with spermine (19Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Leroy D. Schmid N. Behr J.P. Filhol O. Pares S. Garin J. Bourgarit J.J. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17400-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To answer this, we decided to examine the effect of spermine on the catalytic subunit alone. The fission yeast Hsk1 kinase, unlike budding yeast or mammalian Cdc7 kinase, has basal phosphorylation activity by itself (22Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22083-22090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have purified GST-Hsk1 alone or GST-Hsk1 in complex with Dfp1/Him1 and compared the effect of spermine (Fig. 5). Whereas the addition of spermine stimulated the Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 complex-mediated phosphorylation of Mrc1 protein by 16-fold, it stimulated the Hsk1-mediated phosphorylation only by 2-fold. This indicates that the spermine exerts its stimulatory effect mainly through the Dfp1/Him1 activation subunit. To define the domain on the activation subunit responsible for stimulation by spermine, we next compared full-length ASK and the “minimum” ASK for the response to increased concentration of spermine. The minimum ASK carries amino acids 171–350, containing Motif-M and Motif-C sufficient for activation of Cdc7 kinase. Indeed, the purified Cdc7-minimum ASK complex can phosphorylate MCM to the extent similar to that of Cdc7-full length ASK complex. However, the addition of spermine resulted in only less than a 2-fold stimulation of phosphorylation, whereas the Cdc7-full length ASK was stimulated by nearly 20-fold at an optimum spermine concentration (Fig. 6). This result indicates that, although the minimum ASK is sufficient for activation of Cdc7 kinase, the complex is not significantly activated by spermine, suggesting that the segment of ASK which responds to spermine may lie outside the minimum ASK. Because the long C-terminal tail of human ASK is diverged between species and is not present in the yeast counterparts, it is likely that Motif-N missing in the minimum ASK may be involved in stimulation by spermine. We speculate that Motif-N, a BRCA1 C-terminal domain-like motif nonessential for activation of Cdc7 (23Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-313787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Sato N. Sato M. Nakayama M. Saitoh R. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), may play a role in recognition of the substrate. Because spermine differentially affects the level of phosphorylation of different substrates (data not shown), it may affect the kinase-substrate interactions through Motif-N. Effect of Other Compounds on Cdc7 Kinase Activity in Vitro; Stimulation by Histones—We then examined other compounds (Fig. 7). All the positively charged compounds including protamine and melittin stimulated Cdc7 kinase activity. The 13-mer oligonucleotide containing five basic residues (lysine or arginine) slightly stimulated Cdc7 kinase activity in vitro, whereas lysine or arginine did not show any stimulation. On the other hand, negatively charged molecules, including polyU and heparin, inhibited Cdc7 kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 7 and data not shown). The addition of DNA generally inhibited Cdc7 kinase (data not shown). Interestingly, histone and histone H1 also stimulated Cdc7 kinase activity at an optimum concentration (Fig. 7). Therefore, we have examined histone subunits for their ability to inhibit Cdc7 kinase activity (Fig. 8). Histone H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 stimulated Cdc7 kinase activity by 2–5-fold at a concentration around 20 μg/ml. The highest stimulation was observed with histone H1. MCM associates with chromatin in late telophase to early G1, and Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of MCM occurs on chromatin. Thus, histones in the chromatin may facilitate the Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of MCM proteins or other chromatin-associated substrates. It was reported before that histone H3 associates with MCM2 protein (24Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, we have examined whether MCM associated with histones may be phosphorylated more efficiently than free MCM. As shown in Fig. 9, histones were coimmunoprecipitated with MCM, and MCM in the complex was more efficiently phosphorylated by Cdc7 than the immunoprecipitated MCM alone. This result supports the idea that histones may play a role in stimulating Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of MCM protein and other substrates on the chromatin. Overexpression of Antizyme Results in Decrease of Cdc7-mediated Phosphorylation in the Cell—Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, and the cellular polyamine levels can be altered by manipulating the cellular levels of ODC. Antizymes are involved in degradation of ornithine decarboxylase as well as in negative regulation of polyamine transport (38Mangold U. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39Iwata S. Sato Y. Asada M. Takagi M. Tsujimoto A. Inaba T. Yamada T. Sakamoto S. Yata J. Shimogori T. Igarashi K. Mizutani S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of an antizyme is known to reduce intracellular polyamine contents. We have examined the effect of ectopic expression of an antizyme on DNA replication and cellular phosphorylation of MCM4, a known target of Cdc7 kinase (9Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M. Ishii A. Tanaka T. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Ohtani K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39249-39261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of AZ2 expression vector into 293T cells resulted in a decrease of cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine (from 48.9% in vector-transfected cells to 18.9% in AZ2-transfected cells; Fig. 10A). Cdc7 is known to phosphorylate MCM2 and MCM4 on the chromatin during S phase. Thus, we have examined the phosphorylation state of MCM by using an antibody directed against a specific serine residue (Ser-6) phosphorylated by Cdc7 (S6T7 antibody (9Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M. Ishii A. Tanaka T. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Ohtani K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39249-39261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). The S6T7 signal in the chromatin-enriched fraction was significantly lower in AZ2-transfected cells than that in control cells (Fig. 10B). Administration of α-difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ODS, also led to decreased S6T7 signal (data not shown). These results are consistent with the idea that decreased cellular polyamine level affects Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation and, thus, the rate of DNA replication, suggesting that polyamines may be involved in regulation of Cdc7 kinase activity in the cells. Stimulators and Inhibitors of Cdc7 Kinase in Vitro—It has not been known whether Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation events are regulated by exogenous proteins or factors, except that Lee et al. (30Lee J.K. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that Cdc23 (MCM10) stimulates Hsk1 kinase activity in vitro. In this communication we examined whether positively or negatively charged polymers affect the Cdc7 kinase activity in vitro. We have shown that positively charged polymers such as polyamines and polylysine significantly stimulate Cdc7 kinase-mediated phosphorylation events in vitro, whereas negatively charged polymers such as polyglutamate or heparin inhibited the phosphorylation. Among various polyamines, spermine was most effective, and its stimulatory effect was more significant at lower concentration of magnesium, as was observed for casein kinase (31Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7011-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Leroy D. Heriche J.K. Filhol O. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Titration of substrates show that both affinity (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) for MCM2-4-6-7 substrate is increased by 3-fold in the presence of 2.5 mm spermine. Mechanisms of Stimulation and Inhibition—It is known that polyamines stimulate phosphorylation by casein kinase in vitro by binding to its regulatory subunit β (21Leroy D. Schmid N. Behr J.P. Filhol O. Pares S. Garin J. Bourgarit J.J. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17400-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7011-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc7 is a rather unique kinase in the phylogenetic tree of kinase families, but it is most related to casein kinase. The acidophilic nature of substrate recognition (5Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) is also shared by casein kinase and Cdc7 kinase. Negatively charged polymers may compete with the substrate target site embedded in the acidic environment for the substrate recognition surface of Cdc7 kinase complex, thus leading to strong inhibition of the kinase activity. We do not know the mechanism of spermine-mediated stimulation of Cdc7 kinase. The stimulatory effect of positively charged polymers appears to be conserved through species, since strong stimulation was observed also with the fission yeast Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 kinase complex. Different substrates, MCM and Mrc1, are equally stimulated. Thus, it appears that polyamines may directly activate Cdc7 kinase complex. However, we have observed that different sets of polypeptides exhibit varied responses to spermine in Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation assays; phosphorylation of some polypeptides are highly stimulated by the presence of spermine, whereas that of others are not affected at all. 4A. Ishii, Y. Odagiri, and H. Masai, unpublished results. Furthermore, autophosphorylation of Hsk1 was not stimulated by spermine, whereas it stimulated Mrc1 phosphorylation (see the phosphorylation of Hsk1 protein in Fig. 5). This suggests that polyamines may also interact with substrates, facilitating the Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation on specific substrates. Alternatively, interaction of polyamines with Cdc7 kinase complex may somehow facilitate its recognition of specific substrates. The β subunit of casein kinase possesses a segment rich in acidic residues that was shown to interact with polyamines (19Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Leroy D. Schmid N. Behr J.P. Filhol O. Pares S. Garin J. Bourgarit J.J. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17400-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The purified human Cdc7 polypeptide alone, which is completely inert as a kinase, was not activated by the presence of spermine (data not shown), indicating that spermine is not able to replace the function of the activation subunit. Spermine activated Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1 kinase complex much more efficiently than it did Hsk1 protein alone (Fig. 5), consistent with the notion that the activation subunit is the major target of spermine. Spermine, however, could not very efficiently activate Cdc7 in a complex with minimum ASK (amino acids 171–350), which contains only the conserved motif M and C essential and sufficient for activation of Cdc7 kinase (Fig. 6 (23Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-313787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Sato N. Sato M. Nakayama M. Saitoh R. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Thus, spermine interaction domain, if any, may be present outside the minimum ASK segment. We indeed detected binding of spermine to the Cdc7-ASK preparation we have used in the kinase assays (data not shown). At present, however, we are not able to conclude whether this is a genuine, specific interaction, or it simply reflects nonspecific ionic interaction between the positively charged compounds and negatively-charged surface of the kinase complex. Potential Roles of Histone in Regulation of Cdc7 Kinase Activity—Histones significantly stimulated Cdc7 kinase activity in vitro, presumably due to their acidic nature. MCM2 protein has been shown to bind to histone H3 (24Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have shown that MCM-histone complex is phosphorylated by Cdc7 more efficiently than is the free MCM. Because Cdc7 regulates the processes of DNA replication at the origins as well as at replication forks, its major targets are on the chromatin. Thus, it is an intriguing possibility that histones facilitate the phosphorylation events mediated by Cdc7 on the chromatin. Cdc7 as a Novel Target of Polyamines in Regulation of Cell Proliferation—Polyamines have been shown to play diverse roles in cell proliferation. They are known to regulate various signal transduction pathways and cell cycle progression through regulating the activity and abundance of transcription/post-transcription factors as well as through modulating protein-DNA interactions by their nucleic acid binding ability (34Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Polyamines generally stimulate cell proliferation and carcinogenesis and have been regarded as promising molecular targets for cancer therapy (35Gerner E.W. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 36Casero Jr., R.A. Marton L.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 373-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The fact that ectopic expression of an antizyme reduced the phosphorylation level of MCM4 (Fig. 10) is consistent with the physiological role of polyamine regulation of Cdc7 kinase. The findings in this report show the possibility that Cdc7 is another molecular target of polyamines and shed a novel light into the mechanism of polyamine-induced growth stimulation of normal and cancer cells.
