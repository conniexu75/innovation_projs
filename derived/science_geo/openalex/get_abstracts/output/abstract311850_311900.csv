https://openalex.org/W2025222159,"The nature of chain folding in polymers and the determination of the chain length at which folding occurs have been central questions in polymer science. The study of the formation of lamellar polymer crystals through chain folding has received a new impetus as a result of the recent synthesis of normal alkanes of strictly uniform chain lengths up to C(390) H(782). Chain folding is found in all such paraffins starting with C(150)H(302). As with polyethylenes obtained by conventional polymerization, the fold length in the normal alkanes varies with crystallization temperature, but it is always an integral reciprocal of the full chain length. This behavior indicates that the methyl end groups are located at the lamellar surface and that the fold itself must be sharp and adjacently reentrant."

Of the total phosphorus-32 and -33 absorbed by Artemisia, 86 percent was from the interspace shared with Agropyron spicatum and only 14 percent from that shared with Agropyron desertorum. Actively absorbing mycorrhizal roots of Agropyron and Artemisia were present in both interspaces, where competition for the labeled phosphate occurred. The results have important implications about the way in which plants compete for resources below ground in both natural plant communities and agricultural intercropping systems."
https://openalex.org/W2041664896,"The central pattern generator for swimming in the pteropod mollusk Clione limacina consists of at least four pedal interneurons, two each controlling parapodial upstroke and downstroke. The two sets of antagonistic interneurons are linked by reciprocal monosynaptic inhibitory synapses, and all exhibit apparently strong postinhibitory rebound. This simple neuronal network produces reverberating alternate cyclic activity in the absence of tonic drive or apparent feedback modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2060908266,"Genetic diversity in remnant populations of the Sonoran topminnow Poeciliopsis occidentalis (Pisces: Poeciliidae) from Arizona, where the species is endangered, is compared with that in populations from Sonora, Mexico, where the fish is widespread and abundant. Geographically peripheral Arizona populations contain substantially lower levels of genetic variation than do Mexican populations near the center of the species' range. Allelic differences among three genetically and geographically distinct groups are responsible for 53 percent of the total genetic diversity in this species, 26 percent is due to differences among local populations within the groups, and 21 percent is due to heterozygosity within local populations. Recommendations for conservation and restocking efforts in Arizona are based on these genetic findings."
https://openalex.org/W1979432408,"A destructive earthquake that occurred in 1886 near Charleston, South Carolina, was associated with widespread liquefaction of shallow sand structures and their extravasation to the surface. Several seismically induced paleoliquefaction structures preserved within the shallow sediments in the meizoseismal area of the 1886 event were identified. Field evidence and radiocarbon dates suggest that at least two earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6.2 preceded the 1886 event in the past 3000 to 3700 years. The evidence yielded an initial estimate of about 1500 to 1800 years for the maximum recurrence of destructive, intraplate earthquakes in the Charleston region."

https://openalex.org/W2042927079,"Previous tree-ring studies indicated that the total area affected by drought in the western United States has rhythmically expanded and contracted over the past 300 years, with a period near the 18.6-year lunar nodal and 22-year double-sunspot cycles. Recently collected tree-ring data from the U.S. Corn Belt for the years 1680 to 1980 were examined for evidence of either of these cycles on a regional scale. Spectral analysis indicated no periodicity in the eastern part of the Corn Belt, but a significant 18.33-year period in the western part. The period length changed from 17.60 to 20.95 years between the first 150 years and the last 151. High-resolution frequency analysis showed that the structure of the 18.33-year spectral peak was complex, with contributions from several frequencies near both the lunar nodal and double-sunspot periods. A t-test of difference of means in reconstructed annual precipitation weakly corroborated a previous finding of an association between drought area and the phase of the double-sunspot cycle. Both the high-resolution frequency analysis and the t-test results indicate that the periodic component of drought near 20 years is too weak and irregular to be of use in drought forecasting for the Corn Belt."
