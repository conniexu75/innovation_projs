https://openalex.org/W1996487270,"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in males and is second only to lung cancer. Although effective surgical and radiation treatments exist for clinically localized prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer remains essentially incurable. Here we show, through gene expression profiling, that the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is overexpressed in hormone-refractory, metastatic prostate cancer. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeted against EZH2 reduce the amounts of EZH2 protein present in prostate cells and also inhibit cell proliferation in vitro. Ectopic expression of EZH2 in prostate cells induces transcriptional repression of a specific cohort of genes. Gene silencing mediated by EZH2 requires the SET domain and is attenuated by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity. Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression."

When a nucleus is placed in oocyte cytoplasm, the changes in chromatin structure that govern differentiation can be reversed, and the nucleus can be made to control development to term."

https://openalex.org/W2010494349,"The unfolded proteinresponse pathway (UPR) is believed to detect and compensate for excessive protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The UPR can be induced by pharmacological agents that perturb ER functions, but may also occur during cellular developmental processes such as the transition of B-lymphocytes into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Here we show that major UPR components are activated in B cells stimulated to secrete antibody. Increased expression of UPR targets including the ER chaperones BiP and GRP94 and the transcription factor XBP-1 initiates early in the differentiation program prior to up-regulated synthesis of Ig chains. Furthermore, these same kinetics are observed during differentiation for cleavage of the ER-localized ATF6α protein and splicing of XBP-1 mRNA to generate p50ATF6α and p54XBP-1, the two known UPR transcriptional activators. All of these UPR events reach maximal levels once Ig synthesis and secretion are markedly induced. Interestingly, these events are not accompanied by expression of CHOP, a transcription factor induced by ER stress agents commonly used to investigate the UPR. These results suggest that a physiological UPR elicited during differentiation of B-lymphocytes into high-rate secretory cells may be distinct from the UPR defined by agents that disrupt protein maturation in the ER."

https://openalex.org/W2052679444,"Wavy leaves may not depend only on their genes to make their edges crinkle. The edge of a torn plastic sheet forms a complex three-dimensional fractal shape. We have found that the shape results from a simple elongation of the sheet in the direction along its edge. Natural growth processes in some leaves, flowers and vesicles could lead to a similar elongation and hence to the generation of characteristic wavy shapes."
https://openalex.org/W1996443605,"The overexpression of the human ATP-binding cassette half-transporter, ABCG2 (placenta-specific ABC transporter, mitoxantrone resistance-associated protein, breast cancer resistance protein), causes multidrug resistance in tumor cells. An altered drug resistance profile and substrate recognition were suggested for wild-type ABCG2 and its mutant variants (R482G and R482T); the mutations were found in drug-selected tumor cells. In order to characterize the different human ABCG2 transporters without possible endogenous dimerization partners, we expressed these proteins and a catalytic center mutant (K86M) in Sf9 insect cells. Transport activity was followed in intact cells, whereas the ATP binding and hydrolytic properties of ABCG2 were studied in isolated cell membranes. We found that the K86M mutant had no transport or ATP hydrolytic activity, although its ATP binding was retained. The wild-type ABCG2 and its variants, R482G and R482T, showed characteristically different drug and dye transport activities; mitoxantrone and Hoechst 33342 were transported by all transporters, whereas rhodamine 123 was only pumped by the R482G and R482T mutants. In each case, ABCG2-dependent transport was blocked by the specific inhibitor, fumitremorgin C. A relatively high basal ABCG2-ATPase, inhibited by fumitremorgin C, was observed in all active proteins, but specific drug stimulation could only be observed in the case of R482G and R482T mutants. We found that ABCG2 is capable of a vanadate-dependent adenine nucleotide trapping. Nucleotide trapping was stimulated by the transported compounds in the R482G and R482T variants but not in the wild-type ABCG2. These experiments document the applicability of the Sf9 expression system for parallel, quantitative examination of the specific transport and ATP hydrolytic properties of different ABCG2 proteins and demonstrate significant differences in their substrate interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2080466925,"The N terminus of the human MUC2 mucin (amino acids 1–1397) has been expressed as a recombinant tagged protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The intracellular form was found to be an endoglycosidase H-sensitive monomer, whereas the secreted form was an oligomer that gave monomers upon disulfide bond reduction. The secreted MUC2 N terminus contained a trypsin-resistant core fragment. Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry of the peptides obtained localized this core fragment to the C-terminal end of the recombinant protein. This core retained its oligomeric nature with an apparent mass of ∼240 kDa. Upon reduction, peptides of ∼85 kDa were found, suggesting that the N terminus forms trimers. This interpretation was also supported by gel electrophoresis and gel filtration of the intact MUC2 N terminus. Electron microscopy revealed three globular domains each linked via an extended and flexible region to a central part in a trefoil-like manner. Immunostaining with gold-labeled antibodies localized the N-terminal end to the three globular structures, and the antibodies directed against the Myc and green fluorescent protein tags attached at the C terminus localized these to the stalk side of the central trefoil. The N terminus of the MUC2 mucin is thus assembled into trimers that contain proteolytically stable parts, suggesting that MUC2 can only be partly degraded by intestinal proteases and thus is able to maintain a mucin network protecting the intestine.

Mucins are highly glycosylated proteins protecting the mucosal surfaces of the body. All mucins are characterized by their heavyO-glycosylation, which is clustered in mucin domains rich in the amino acids Ser, Thr, and Pro. Mucins can be structured in different ways, either as membrane-bound with a transmembrane domain or secreted as monomers or as polymers (1Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Google Scholar, 2Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1255-1283Google Scholar). The latter mucins are also described as gel-forming, as these give the mucus its viscoelastic properties. Four human gel-forming mucins have been found, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6, which are clustered on chromosome 11p15 (3Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Google Scholar). However, the best studied mucin is the porcine submaxillary mucin (PSM), 1The abbreviations used are: PSM, porcine submaxillary mucin; vWF, von Willebrand factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization which has become a model also for the human mucins of this type (3Perez-Vilar J.

The MUC2 mucin is the main gel-forming mucin of the small and large intestines and is produced by the intestinal goblet cells (2Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1255-1283Google Scholar, 7Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol.

It is a major structural component of the mucous barrier covering the epithelium, protecting the epithelial cells from microorganisms as well as digestive enzymes. In fact, one of the remarkable features of this mucin is that it can withstand the pancreatic digestive enzymes. That the highly glycosylated mucin domains are totally resistant to these enzymes is easy to understand. However, the globular, less glycosylated ends must also be relatively proteolytically resistant, as the polymers must remain intact to maintain the mucous gel. The MUC2 mucin is difficult to solubilize, and it is insoluble in 4 mguanidinium chloride (8Carlstedt I. Herman A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.-Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Google Scholar, 10Herrmann A. Davies J.R. Lindell G. Mårtensson S. Packer N.H. Swallow D.M. Carlstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15828-15836Google Scholar), a property that might be related to the appearance of nonreducible covalent linkages in addition to the disulfide bonds (10Herrmann A. Davies J.R. Lindell G. Mårtensson S. Packer N.H. Swallow D.M. Carlstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15828-15836Google Scholar, 11Axelsson M.A.B. Asker N. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18864-18870Google Scholar). The MUC2 mucin has been reported to be aberrantly expressed in the airways upon Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis, where its properties might contribute to the abnormal mucous viscosity in this disorder (12Li J.-D. Dohrman A.F. Gallup M. Miyata S. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Nadel J.A. Prince A. Basbaum C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 967-972Google Scholar). Both N and C termini of human MUC2 show sequence similarities to the respective termini of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and PSM. The vWF is dimerized in the endoplasmic reticulum via intermolecular disulfide bond formation of its C terminus. Multimerization takes place in the Golgi via disulfide bonds between cysteines in the N terminus, where the vWF forms end-to-end oligomers (13Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Google Scholar, 14Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Google Scholar). Thus, the vWF will form linear polymers (13Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Google Scholar, 14Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Google Scholar). This observation also suggests that the polymerized gel-forming mucins are linear, which is consistent with biophysical studies of mucins (15Carlstedt I. Lindgren H. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 427-435Google Scholar, 16Sheehan J.K. Thornton D.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 125: 87-96Google Scholar). However, when the N terminus of PSM was recombinantly expressed, the results suggested that it formed trimers instead of the predicted dimers (5Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. de Luca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Google Scholar, 6Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34527-34534Google Scholar). This suggestion has been disputed, and it has also been suggested that PSM may be oligomerized differently from other mucins. To study how the N terminus takes part in the multimerization of the MUC2 mucin, the MUC2 N terminus was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The secreted oligomerized mucin was purified and shown by electron microscopy to be held together in a central condense core surrounded by three large globular domains. The oligomer was also shown to have a large portion that was resistant to trypsin digestion. The trypsin-resistant “core fragment” was localized and shown to be a trimer. CHO-K1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61). Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin and supplemented with sodium pyruvate (110 mg/liter),l-arginine (116 mg/liter), l-glutamine (290 mg/liter), l-asparagine (36 mg/liter), folic acid (10 mg/liter), and β-mercaptoethanol (3.49 μl/liter). Transfected cells were kept in G418 (250 μg/ml). DNA clones D8, SMUC343 (7Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Google Scholar), and SMUC313 2J. R. Gum, Jr., unpublished data. contain bp 1–617, 565–1792, and 1665–4208, respectively, of the published sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession number L21998) (7Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Google Scholar). D8 and SMUC343 were joined by a natural EcoRI site at bp 566, and SMUC313 was added to the end of SMUC343 by the naturalSfiI site at bp 1676. RNA from the cell line LS174T was used to obtain a 241-bp reverse transcription-PCR product using primers 5′-ACGACGGTGACCGAGAACCATTT and 5′-TCTAGAGGTGATACACTTATCCATGGGCCA. The PCR product was ligated to the 3′-end of the D8-SMUC343-SMUC313 construct using a natural BamHI site to give a uniqueXbaI site at the 3′-end. The construct was made in pBluescript (Stratagene). The DNA was sequenced; compared with the published sequence; and found to be identical with one exception: at positions 4079 and 4080, AT was substituted with TA. This change gives rise to an amino acid substitution of His to Leu and has previously been found to be a conflict (17Toribara N.W. Gum Jr., J.R. Culhane P.J. Lagace R.E. Hicks J.W. Petersen G.M. Kim Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1005-1013Google Scholar). This change was not corrected. Enhanced GFP was removed from the pEGFP vector (Clontech) by digestion with NheI andEcoRI, and the murine Ig κ-chain leader sequence from pSecTagA (Invitrogen) replaced enhanced GFP using the same sites. The multicloning site was changed by digesting with HindIII andXbaI and ligating the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTCGAGTGAGCTCACTAGTGAGCAGAAGCTGATCAGCGAGGAGGACCTGTCTAGAAAGCTTA and 5′-CTAGTAAGCTTTCTAGACAGGTCCTCCTCGCTGATCAGCTTCTGCTCACTAGTGAGCTCACTCG to the vector. The new multicloning site makes the HindIII and XbaI sites used in the cloning nonfunctional and adds new sites: SacI, XhoI, SpeI, andXbaI. The sequence between the SpeI andXbaI sites encodes a Myc tag, and a stop codon is situated after the XbaI site. The MUC2 N terminus (SacI toXbaI) was inserted into the pS-M vector via SacI and SpeI. Using the SacI site (bp 96) removes the natural signal sequence and is an in-frame ligation with the Myc tag, creating pSNMUC2-M. Mutagenesis of pEGFP-C1, enabling in-frame ligation, was carried out using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers 5′-GCTAGCGCTACCGGTGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGG and 5′-CCTTGCTCACCATGGTGGCACCGGTAGCGCTAGC. Enhanced GFP was cut out withNheI and XbaI and inserted in-frame into pSNMUC2-M in the XbaI site, resulting in the pSNMUC2-MG expression vector. The expression vector pSNMUC2-MG was transfected into CHO-K1 cells by electroporation using the Gene Pulser II RF module (Bio-Rad). Cells were trypsinized; washed once with 272 mm sucrose, 7 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 1 mmMgCl2; and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Electroporation was performed using 400 V and 50% modulation at 40 kHz for 15 pulses of 1 ms each at 1-s intervals. Positive clones were selected by adding 250 μg/ml G418 48 h post-transfection. Positive clones, determined by fluorescence, were subcloned in microtiter plates, and strongly fluorescent clones were expanded and investigated by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. One high-level expression clone was selected for further investigation. Newly confluent CHO-pSNMUC2-MG cells were starved for 2 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of Met- and Cys-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum per 27-cm2 Petri dish and metabolically labeled at 37 °C using 150 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (Redivue PRO-MIX35S cell labeling mixture, Amersham Biosciences) per Petri dish. The medium was collected and adjusted to 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline before lysis in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Lysates were sonicated three times for 5 s each (MSE Soniprep 100, intensity of 15) and clarified by centrifugation. The Laemmli system was used for gel electrophoresis, which was carried out on 0.75-mm thick gels in a Mini-Protean II cell (Bio-Rad). Precision protein standards (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular mass markers. Silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels was carried out according to the method described by Blum et al. (18Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-MUC2N1 antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide EDPEEEVAPASC (GPEP11, amino acids 207–218 of MUC2) as previously described for the anti-MUC2N3 antiserum (19Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Google Scholar). This antiserum was used directly or purified on a 3-ml gel prepared from 1 g of thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). 7 mg of peptide (GPEP11) dissolved in binding buffer were pumped through the gel at 40 μl/min for 16 h. After washing the column at 350 μl/min with 30 ml each of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.5), and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), the anti-MUC2N1 antiserum (10 ml), dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and diluted with the same buffer to 50 ml, was applied to the column at 200 μl/min. The column was washed at 500 μl/min with 60 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 60 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 500 mm NaCl. The antibodies were eluted with 30 ml of 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.5) into a tube with 3 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Additional 2 m Tris base was added to bring the eluate to a pH of ∼7.0. The eluate was concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged to 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 by ultrafiltration (3000 ×g at +4 °C; Vivaspin 2 RC,M r 30,000 cutoff, Sartorius Corp.). The anti-MUC2N3 antiserum (19Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Google Scholar) was used unpurified, and the anti-Myc mAb (clone 9E10, American Type Culture Collection, CRL-1729) was used as hybridoma spent culture medium. The anti-GFP mAb was from BD Biosciences. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot transfer medium, Bio-Rad) in 25 mmTris and 192 mm glycine using a semidry transfer cell (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad) at 2 mA/cm2 for 2 h. The membrane was blocked for 3 h at room temperature in 10% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated at 4 °C overnight with the primary antibody. The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; anti-rabbit or anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG, Dako Corp.) and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. 50 μl of Dynabeads M-450 (goat anti-mouse IgG; 4 × 108 beads/ml; Dynal, Inc.) were washed three times with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at room temperature with 200 μl of anti-Myc mAb hybridoma supernatant. The beads were washed four times with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. 2 ml of metabolically labeled culture medium and cell lysate, respectively, were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing 10 times with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, the beads were eluted in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 1% SDS for 5 min at 95 °C. 100 ml of culture medium and cell lysates, respectively, containing SNMUC2-MG were filtrated in an Amicon Model 8400 stirred cell through an Amicon YM100 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore Corp.). The volume was reduced to 25 ml, diluted to 300 ml with BT buffer (20 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 6.0)), and reduced again to 25 ml. This procedure was repeated four times. Aliquots (5 ml) of the concentrate were loaded onto a Superose 6 preparation grade column (1000 × 26 mm; Amersham Biosciences) in BT buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The eluting proteins were monitored at 280 nm and collected in 6-ml fractions. The SNMUC2-MG-containing fractions, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and directly loaded onto an ion-exchange column (Mono Q 5/5, AmershamBiosciences) in BT buffer. Medium-derived SNMUC2-MG was washed with 210 mm NaCl in BT buffer and eluted with 250 mmNaCl in BT buffer. Lysate-derived SNMUC2-MG was washed with 170 mm NaCl in BT buffer and eluted with 210 mmNaCl in BT buffer. The collected 1-ml fractions were individually analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. After gel filtration as well as ion-exchange chromatography, the fractions were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-Myc mAb and anti-MUC2N1 antiserum. The fractions containing SNMUC2-MG were pooled (no forms of intact SNMUC2-MG were excluded), dialyzed against H2O, and lyophilized. This purification finally resulted in a yield of ∼0.5 mg of SNMUC2-MG protein. 50 μg of nonreduced purified SNMUC2-MG were dissolved in 100 μl of 4 m guanidinium chloride and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column eluted at 0.25 ml/min using an OptoLab DSP refractometer (Wyatt Technology Corp.) as the detector. The column had a void volume of 7.7 ml, and the standards β-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) eluted at 14.61, 14.51, and 10.70 ml, respectively. Purified medium-derived SNMUC2-MG (100 μg) was incubated in 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 95 °C and subsequently diluted with 9 volumes of 100 mm ammonium acetate (pH 8.5). After addition of 5 μg of tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma), the sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. For deglycosylation, the trypsin digest was stopped with 100 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at room temperature for 4 h, and 4 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the sample and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Purification was done on lyophilized material that was redissolved in 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 8.5) and separated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) using a Smart HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing the tryptic core fragment were lyophilized with and without prior reduction in 10 mm dithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitated35S-labeled SNMUC2-MG was lyophilized before addition of 100 μl of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and incubated for 90 min on ice. Hydrogen fluoride was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and finally for 15 min in a SpeedVac concentrator. The material was redissolved in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer with 200 mmdithiothreitol and analyzed on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 35S-Labeled SNMUC2-MG was immunoprecipitated, and the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Aliquots (10 μl) were washed twice with 100 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 4 mm calcium chloride, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer before addition of 0.5 μl of neuraminidase (1 unit/ml), 0.5 μl of O-glycosidase (0.5 units/ml), or 0.5 μl of endoglycosidase H (5 units/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. Aliquots (10 μl) were washed twice with 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer before addition of 0.5 μl of N-glycosidase F (1000 units/ml). All samples were incubated on a shaker overnight at 37 °C. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were eluted in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 10% mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The deglycosylated tryptic core fragment was separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient Ready-Gel (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue. After destaining in 30% methanol and 7% acetic acid, the gel was soaked in H2O overnight. The excised band was cut into 1-mm pieces. After successive washing steps for 30 min at room temperature on a shaker in 0.2 mammonium bicarbonate, 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and 25% acetonitrile, H2O and 25% acetonitrile, H2O and 50% acetonitrile, and 100% acetonitrile, the gel pieces were air-dried for 2 h. 1 volume of trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 20 μg/ml in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate) was added to the dried gel; and 10 min later, an additional volume of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate was added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The peptides were eluted from the gel pieces in 4 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (for MALDI-MS) or 0.2% formic acid (for ESI-MS/MS) for 6 h at room temperature. The reduced and alkylated tryptic core fragment without deglycosylation was in-gel trypsin-digested (see above), lyophilized, and purified on a Zip-Tip C18 column (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MALDI mass spectra were collected on a Micromass Tof-Spec E time-of-flight mass spectrometer with delayed extraction in the reflectron mode. 0.5 μl of matrix solution (10 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 1 ml of 1:1 acetonitrile/water) were mixed on the target with 0.5 μl of sample and then left to dry. The monoisotopic peptide masses from the MALDI mass spectra were matched against theoretical tryptic peptides from the full-length SNMUC2-MG sequence for identification. 0.1 volume of the in-gel trypsin-digested core fragment was purified on a Zip-Tip C18 column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted volume (50%, ∼2 μl) was analyzed by nanoflow ESI-MS/MS on a Micromass Q-Tof 1 mass spectrometer. Argon was used as the collision gas with a collision energy of 40 eV. The lyophilized tryptic core fragment (100 pmol) was redissolved in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and separated by SDS-PAGE on 5% Ready-Gel. After Western blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.) in 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 8.9) and 10% methanol for 90 min at 2 mA/cm2, the membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). The stained band was cut out and N-terminally sequenced by Edman degradation on a Procise 492 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A pulsed-liquid sequencing method for polyvinylidene difluoride-blotted protein was used according to the manufacturer. SNMUC2-MG was analyzed by negative staining and electron microscopy as described previously (20Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Google Scholar). The usual sample concentration was ∼20 μg/ml in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl. Aliquots (5 μl) were adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids for 1 min, washed with 2 drops of water, and stained with 2 drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. In some experiments, the N-terminal particles were identified with the anti-Myc mAb (9E10), the anti-GFP mAb (BD Biosciences), or the purified rabbit anti-MUC2N1 antiserum, all labeled with colloidal thiocyanate gold (21Baschong W. Lucoq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Google Scholar). Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. A plasmid expressing the MUC2 N terminus up to amino acid 1397 (7Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Google Scholar) followed by a Myc tag and GFP was constructed and called pSNMUC2-MG. The MUC2 sequence contains all of the MUC2 N terminus, including the last cysteine (position 1395), and stops at the beginning of the first and small mucin domain. The plasmid was transfected into CHO-K1 cells, and stable cell lines were selected from fluorescent colonies. These were further cloned and analyzed for secretion of the MUC2 N terminus. Several clones showed high-level and consistent secretion of proteins migrating identically upon gel electrophoresis when stained chemically or with antibodies reacting with SNMUC2-MG (anti-MUC2N3 antiserum, anti-Myc mAb, and anti-GFP mAb). One of these clones was selected, expanded, and used for the purification of SNMUC2-MG. To study the expression and sizes of the MUC2 N terminus expressed in the selected CHO cell lines, the cells were metabolically labeled, immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc mAb, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Only one band was precipitated from the cell lysate with an apparent mass of ∼220 kDa, and one band from the medium with an apparent mass of ∼260 kDa, both analyzed in their reduced forms (using the sizes of the Precision protein standards) (Fig.1 A). The nonreduced secreted MUC2 N terminus gave only one large band with a size exceeding that of apoB-100 (512 kDa), which was used as a molecular mass marker. The lack of a marker larger than the N terminus made estimation of the size of the secreted oligomeric product difficult. However, the fact that it migrated significantly slower than the apoB-100 marker suggested that its oligomeric state was higher than a dimer. To analyze the processing of the N terminus in CHO cells, pulse-chase studies were performed. The cells were metabolically labeled for 15 min, followed by a chase for up to 3 h, and analyzed by immunoprecipitation using the anti-Myc mAb and SDS-PAGE. The intracellular band was observed already after the pulse period, and this band vanished at the same time (90–135 min) that the secreted oligomer appeared in the medium (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the N terminus of MUC2 is oligomerized relatively late in the secretory pathway and that the secreted form is present as a disulfide bond-stabilized oligomer. To further study the reason for the difference in size between the intracellular form and the secreted oligomer, both the intracellular and secreted forms were purified. To purify SNMUC2-MG in its secreted oligomeric form as well as in its intracellular monomeric form, identical techniques were used. At first, both the culture medium and cell lysate were concentrated by four rounds of ultrafiltration through a 100-kDa cutoff filter with intermediate dilution with buffer. The concentrates thus lacked small components and were further purified by gel filtration on Sepharose 6. Fractions containing SNMUC2-MG were pooled and directly loaded onto a Mono Q ion-exchange column. The bound proteins were stepwise eluted with increasing amounts of NaCl. The secreted oligomeric form of SNMUC2-MG could be purified to homogeneity, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE, revealing the reduced monomers at an apparent molecular mass of 260 kDa (Fig. 2,lane 1). The purified intracellular monomers with an apparent molecular mass of 220 kDa were still contaminated by a weak band of ∼170 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). On Western blots, the 260- and 220-kDa bands were detected by the anti-MUC2N3 antiserum, the anti-GFP mAb, and the anti-Myc mAb. However, the 170-kDa band was stained only by the anti-MUC2N3 antiserum, suggesting that it was a product of proteolytic cleavage, where the remaining protein lacked the Myc tag and GFP (data not shown). When the intracellular and secreted forms of SNMUC2-MG were analyzed in their reduced forms, a difference in size of ∼40 kDa was revealed (Fig. 2). As glycosylation is one of the possible explanations for this,N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation were analyzed. As CHO cells preferably make mono- and disialylated Galβ1–3GalNAc-(Ser/Thr), O-glycosylation can be studied by neuraminidase treatment, followed by O-glycosidase treatment. As shown in Fig.3 A, when analyzed in their reduced forms, the intracellular form (lysate) was unaffected by these enzymes, whereas the secreted form was reduced in size by this treatment. The secreted form was still larger than the intracellular one, suggesting additional differences or incompleteO-deglycosylation. When the N-glycans were studied by endoglycosidase H digestion, the intracellular N terminus was reduced in size, whereas the secreted one was unaffected (Fig. 3 A). Both forms were affected by the N-glycosidase F trea"

https://openalex.org/W2042916215,"WNK family protein kinases are large enzymes that contain the catalytic lysine in a unique position compared with all other protein kinases. These enzymes have been linked to a genetically defined form of hypertension. In this study we introduced mutations to test hypotheses about the position of the catalytic lysine, and we examined mechanisms involved in the regulation of WNK1 activity. Through the analysis of enzyme fragments and sequence alignments, we have identified an autoinhibitory domain of WNK1. This isolated domain, conserved in all four WNKs, suppressed the activity of the WNK1 kinase domain. Mutation of two key residues in this autoinhibitory domain attenuated its ability to inhibit WNK kinase activity. Consistent with these results, the same mutations in a WNK1 fragment that contain the autoinhibitory domain increased its kinase activity. We also found that WNK1 expressed in bacteria is autophosphorylated; autophosphorylation on serine 382 in the activation loop is required for its activity.

Protein kinases are essential regulators of numerous cellular processes ranging from cell cycle control to differentiation. WNKs (with no lysine (K)) comprise a newly described protein kinase subfamily implicated in controlling the ion permeability of epithelia (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar, 2Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson- Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5562-5569Google Scholar). A unique feature in this kinase subfamily is that the lysine necessary for positioning ATP for phosphoryl transfer is located in an atypical position in the catalytic domain. WNKs, distant relatives of the Ste20p family of protein kinases, have been found in numerous metazoan organisms, including plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, rodents, and humans (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar, 2Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson- Williams C. Desitter I.

Although WNKs have not been found in Saccharomyces, a WNK homolog in Phycomyces was the first reported WNK sequence; because Phycomyces is a filamentous fungus, it cannot be concluded with certainty that WNKs function in unicellular organisms (4Ruiz-Perez V.L. Murillo F.J. Torres-Martinez S. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 309-316Google Scholar). Rat WNK1 was the first mammalian member of this protein kinase family cloned and characterized (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). It contains an N-terminal kinase domain, two coiled-coil domains, and 24 PXXP motifs, which could potentially interact with SH3 domains of other proteins. Partial clones of WNK1 and WNK2 were isolated from cancerous prostate tissue and pancreatic cells, respectively (6Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Google Scholar, 7Ito M. Shichijo S. Tsuda N. Ochi M. Harashima N. Saito N. Itoh K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2038-2046Google Scholar). Four WNK family members have been identified in humans with high sequence identity within their kinase domains (3Verissimo F. Jordan P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5562-5569Google Scholar). Mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 have been shown to cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, a form of familial hypertension resulting from activation of a single gene (2Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson- Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W. Achard J.M. Feely M.P. Dussol B. Berland Y. Unwin R.J. Mayan H. Simon D.B. Farfel Z. Jeunemaitre X. Lifton R.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1107-1112Google Scholar). Northern analysis indicates that WNK1 is widely expressed in different tissues, whereas WNK4 is expressed primarily in kidney (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar, 2Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson- Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W. Achard J.M. Feely M.P. Dussol B. Berland Y. Unwin R.J. Mayan H. Simon D.B. Farfel Z. Jeunemaitre X. Lifton R.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1107-1112Google Scholar, 3Verissimo F. Jordan P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5562-5569Google Scholar). The site of action of these kinases that leads to hypertension is proposed to be the cortical collecting duct of the kidney (2Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson- Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W. Achard J.M. Feely M.P. Dussol B. Berland Y. Unwin R.J. Mayan H. Simon D.B. Farfel Z. Jeunemaitre X. Lifton R.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1107-1112Google Scholar). Mutations found in WNK1 are deletions in the first intron, causing increased WNK1 expression. Mutations in WNK4 are in the coding sequence near the coiled-coil domains; these mutations are presumed to enhance WNK4 function. The known mutations are located in regions highly conserved among members of the WNK family but not common to other protein kinases. The broad distribution of WNKs suggests that they will impact the function of epithelial tissues throughout the body. Protein kinase activity may be regulated by several mechanisms individually or in combination. Many protein kinases contain an autoinhibitory domain outside their catalytic domain, which suppresses kinase activity until some activating signal displaces it from its inhibitory site. Removal of the autoregulatory sequences will increase kinase activity as long as other modifications are not required to release the active conformation. cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been a model for the structural analysis of this mechanism (8Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-429Google Scholar, 9Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Google Scholar). Its regulatory subunit inhibits the activity of an otherwise active catalytic subunit (10Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 397-403Google Scholar). Most protein kinases that employ this mechanism contain an autoregulatory domain within the same protein chain. The first of these to be characterized directly was that in twitchin, a myosin light-chain kinase relative, in which intrasteric inhibition is relieved by the binding of calmodulin (11Hu S.H. Parker M.W. Lei J.Y. Wilce M.C. Benian G.M. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1994; 369: 581-584Google Scholar). The Ste20p-like kinase PAK1 1The abbreviations used are: PAK1, p21-activated kinase 1; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MAPK, mitogen-activate protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MS, mass spectrometry; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; TAK1, TGFβ-activated kinase 1. can be activated by the small G proteins Rac or Cdc42; they bind to a region on PAK1 near the autoinhibitory domain promoting disinhibition (12Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Google Scholar, 13Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Google Scholar). Point mutations have been identified within the PAK regulatory domain that relieve intrasteric suppression of activity (12Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Google Scholar,13Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Google Scholar). Harrison's group solved the crystal structure of PAK1 in the autoinhibited conformation (14Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Google Scholar). They showed that inactive PAK1 exists as a dimer, and the autoinhibitory sequence makes extensive contacts with the active site. Binding of small G-proteins cause conformational changes that relieve autoinhibition (15Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Google Scholar). In this report, we present findings supporting the conclusion that WNK1 is regulated in part through an autoinhibitory mechanism. Additional experiments to probe the regulatory mechanisms of WNK1 have led to the identification of an autophosphorylation site in the activation loop; phosphorylation of residues in the activation loop is a common mechanism for control of protein kinase activity. We also tested whether the position of the catalytic lysine in the phosphate anchor ribbon is consistent with activity in another protein kinase. pGEX-KG-WNK1 and pGEX-KG-WNK1-(1–555) were as described previously (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). To make pGEX-KG-WNK1-(1–491) and pCMV5-Myc-WNK1-(1–491) constructs, a 1.5-kb DNA fragment encoding WNK1-(1–491) was amplified by PCR using pSK-WNK1 as the template and subcloned into pGEX-KG and pCMV5-Myc. To make pGEX-KG-WNK1-(1–639), a 1.9-kb DNA fragment encoding WNK1-(1–639) was amplified by PCR also using pSK-WNK1 as the template and subcloned into pGEX-KG. pGEX-KG-WNK1-(485–555) and pGEX-KG-WNK1-(485–639) plasmids were constructed in a similar way. To make His6-WNK1-(1–491) and His6-WNK1-(198–491), a PCR product encoding either WNK1-(1–491) or -(198–491) was subcloned into a pParallel-His6 vector. pCMV5-Myc-ERK2, pCMV5-RasV12, and pCMV5-MEK1-R4F were as described previously (16Xu B. Stippec S. Robinson F.L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26509-26515Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. GST-WNK1, GST-WNK1-(1–491), GST-WNK1-(1–555), GST-WNK1-(1–639), GST-WNK1-(485–555), GST-WNK1-(485–639), GST, GST-PAK1-(1–231), His6-ERK2 and His6-WNK1-(1–491) were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 using standard purification protocols. His6-WNK1-(198–491) was expressed in the Rosetta strain (Novagen). Myelin basic protein (MBP) was from Sigma. HEK 293 cells were maintained, transfected, and harvested as described previously (17Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Google Scholar). The anti-Myc antibody was obtained from the National Cell Culture Center. The anti-WNK1 antiserum Q256 was as described previously (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose paper. Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies, and then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from 0.2 ml of cell lysate with 2 μl of the specified antibody and 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for a total of 2 h. Precipitates were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mNaCl, and once with 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) and 10 mm MgCl2. Kinase assays were performed in 30 μl of 1× kinase buffer at 30 °C as described (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 7.5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 2 min. Reactions (20 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 100 pmol of WNK1-(198–491) expressed and purified from Rosetta cells was digested with 5 pmol of trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested peptide was split into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was treated with Lambda protein phosphatase (New England BioLabs) at 30 °C for 1 h. Each digest was diluted to ∼5 pmol/ml in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Approximately 1 ml of diluted sample was mixed with 2′,5′-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), then spotted onto a 96-well metal plate (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Experiments were performed on a QSTAR Pulsar i quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (MDS SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization ion source. For MS scans, laser intensity was set at 55 μJ. For MS/MS experiments, laser intensity was adjusted high enough to obtain a sufficient fragmentation signal, the Q1 resolution was set to unit resolution, and argon was used as the collision gas in Q2. All the data were acquired in the manual tune mode, and the accumulation time was set to obtain sufficient signal yield. Protein kinases often contain an autoinhibitory domain outside of the kinase catalytic domain. The removal of the autoinhibitory domain usually results in a constitutively active kinase. To begin to define the mechanisms that regulate the activity of WNK1, we wished to determine if it contains such an autoinhibitory domain. Several GST-tagged WNK1 fragments were expressed in bacteria, purified and tested for their kinase activities (Fig. 1). GST-WNK1-(1–491) had readily detectable kinase activity when MBP was used as its in vitrosubstrate. However, GST-WNK1-(1–555) showed only 1–2% of the activity, suggesting that the additional residues in this fragment were suppressing the catalytic activity of WNK1. GST-WNK1-(1–639), which includes the first coiled-coil domain not present in the other two fragments, was intermediate in activity (∼45% of 1–491). GST-WNK1-(159–491) also had significantly greater activity than GST-WNK1-(159–555) (data not shown). Based on the relative activities of these fragments, we tested residues present in WNK1-(1–555) but not in WNK1-(1–491) as a possible autoinhibitory region. We expressed GST-WNK1-(485–555) in bacteria and tested its ability to inhibit the activity of His6-WNK1-(1–491). We also expressed a GST fusion protein containing residues 485–639, with the idea that inclusion of the coiled-coil domain might moderate the effect of an autoinhibitory domain, based on the observation above that increasing the length of the WNK1 fragment was able to restore activity significantly. As shown in Fig. 2A, GST-WNK1-(485–555) reduced WNK1 kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner; 50% inhibition was achieved at a concentration of the isolated intrasteric domain of ∼0.4 μm. On the other hand, GST-WNK1-(485–639) had a significantly reduced ability to inhibit WNK activity compared with GST-WNK1-(485–555), consistent with the results above. As expected, GST alone had little effect on the activity of His6-WNK1-(1–491). The Ste20p-like protein kinase PAK1 contains a well-defined autoinhibitory domain near its N terminus (18Johnson D.A. Akamine P. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan M. Taylor S.S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2243-2270Google Scholar). To examine the specificity of the autoregulatory domain toward WNK1, we compared the ability of GST-PAK1-(1–231), which encompasses the PAK1 autoinhibitory domain, to influence the activity of His6-WNK1-(1–491). Although GST-WNK1-(485–555) exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on His6-WNK1-(1–491), the autoinhibitory domain of PAK1 was a very poor WNK1 inhibitor (Fig. 2B) at concentrations that completely block PAK activity (not shown) (12Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Google Scholar). To test the specificity of this autoinhibitory domain toward other protein kinases, we examined the ability of GST-WNK1-(485–555) to inhibit ERK2 and p38 MAPKs. ERK2 was inhibited strongly by the WNK1 autoinhibitory domain (Fig. 2C), whereas the autoinhibitory domain had little effect on p38 (data not shown). Within their kinase domains WNK family members display almost 90% identity across mammalian species. The sequence identity outside the kinase core is limited; however, the region corresponding to WNK1 residues 485–555 is well conserved. A sequence alignment of this region among rat WNK1, human WNKs 1–4, and C. elegans WNK revealed two highly conserved phenylalanine residues, Phe-524 and Phe-526 in rat WNK1 (Fig. 3A). We mutated these two residues to alanine to determine whether the mutations would affect the ability of GST-WNK1-(485–555) to inhibit WNK1 activity. The F524A/F526A mutant showed a much reduced inhibitory effect compared with wild type GST-WNK1-(485–555), suggesting an 80–90% reduction in inhibitory potency (Fig. 3B). These results implicate these two phenylalanine residues in autoinhibition. Assuming that Phe-524 and Phe-526 play important roles in WNK1 autoinhibition, mutation of these residues to alanine should increase the kinase activity of GST-WNK1-(1–555), although we expect that the inhibitory domain will still exert a significant effect within a single protein chain. To test this hypothesis, we expressed GST-WNK1-(1–555)-F524A/F526A and compared its kinase activity to wild type WNK1-(1–555). Indeed, the F524A/F526A mutant showed significantly enhanced activity (∼2.5-fold relative to wild type). We calculated an estimated relative concentration of the autoinhibitory domain within the full-length protein to be in the range of 0.9–3 mm, based on the assumption of a 20-residue linker between the autoinhibitory site and the kinase core. With an IC50 of ∼0.4 μm and an effective concentration 3–4 orders of magnitude higher in the intact protein, the 2.5-fold increase in activity of GST-WNK1-(1–555) caused by the F524A/F526A mutations indicates a substantial effect of these residues on inhibition of the catalytic domain. We showed previously that WNK1, like many protein kinases, autophosphorylates on serine residues (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation may be involved in the activation mechanism or may serve other purposes, such as creation of binding sites for other proteins. In the kinase family, autophosphorylation sites usually lie either within the activation loop or outside the catalytic core. WNK1 contains two serine residues, serine 378 and serine 382, within its activation loop that we expected would be phosphorylated due to the similarity of their positions to regulatory phosphorylation sites within other protein kinases, e.g. MAPKs and MAPK kinases. Because WNK1 expressed in bacteria has significant kinase activity, any modifications required for this activity should be self-catalyzed. Thus, we examined the possibility that WNK1 autophosphorylated on Ser-378 and/or Ser-382 and that these phosphorylations might be important for WNK1 activity. Ser-378 and Sre-382 were mutated singly and in combination to alanine or aspartic acid in GST-WNK1-(1–491) (Fig. 4A). The resulting mutants were tested for kinase activity (Fig. 4B). The single mutant S378A had ∼50% of the activity of the wild type WNK1 fragment, suggesting that it is dispensable but contributes to maximal WNK1 activity. The double mutant and the single mutant S382A, on the other hand, had very little kinase activity (from 1–3% of wild type) toward MBP. The single mutant S382D and the double mutant also had very little activity. These results indicate that phosphorylation of S382 is essential for WNK1 activity and that aspartate cannot mimic phosphoserine at this position. On the other hand, the single mutant S378D had 3- to 4-fold more activity than the wild type WNK1 fragment, suggesting that aspartate acid at this position can mimic the phosphorylated state of S378 and that this site also contributes to WNK1 activity. To test whether WNK1 activation loop sites might be phosphorylated in mammalian cells, we transfected 293 cells with Myc-tagged WNK1-(1–491) wild type or the double mutant S378A/S382A. Cells were untreated or treated with 0.5 m NaCl 15 min prior to harvest. Myc-WNK1-(1–491) was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an anti-WNK1 antibody followed by in vitro kinase assay to examine its autophosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Wild type WNK1-(1–491) retained the ability to autophosphorylate, whereas the S378A/S382A mutant showed a much reduced ability to autophosphorylate. The single S382A mutant behaved much like the double mutant (data not shown). We previously showed that NaCl activates endogenous WNK1 (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). NaCl caused a small but reproducible change in autophosphorylation of WNK1-(1–491) but not of the double mutant. NaCl also caused a decrease in electrophoretic mobility of wild type and mutant WNK1-(1–491). Although the shift in the wild type protein was not as obvious as for the double mutant in this experiment, the mobility of WNK1-(1–491) has decreased consistently in NaCl-treated cells. The molecular mass of His6-WNK1-(198–491) determined by mass spectrometry was 80 Da higher than the calculated mass, suggesting that it was phosphorylated as isolated from bacteria. Following tryptic digestion, an aliquot of the protein was treated with phosphatase and compared with untreated protein. The MS scan of the tryptic digests showed a peak absent in the phosphatase-treated but present in the untreated sample (not shown). This peak corresponded to the peptide SVIGTPEFMAPEMYEEK in the activation loop. To determine which of the three potential phosphorylation sites in this peptide was phosphorylated, we measured the collision-induced dissociation MS of the parent ion that corresponded to the phosphopeptide p(SVIGTPEFMAPEMYEEK) (Fig. 4D). The py17 and py17Δ ions were identified, indicating that the phosphate is on the first serine of the peptide, serine 382. Additional analyses revealed some phosphorylation of serine 378 as well (data not shown). Protein kinase catalytic domains have been characterized as containing twelve conserved subdomains that are located in well conserved structural elements of protein kinases (19Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar,20Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-413Google Scholar). Several key residues are absolutely required for catalysis and are thus considered invariable. Among these, the catalytic lysine, which binds phosphoryl groups of ATP, is found in subdomain II, which is located on beta strand 3 of the kinase core. A unique feature shared among WNKs is that this catalytic lysine is located not on beta strand 3, but instead on beta strand 2 in subdomain I, which contains another conserved element, the glycine-rich loop of the phosphate anchor ribbon. Beta strand 2 has a superficial position on the kinase core, making this catalytic residue of WNKs more surface-exposed than the functionally equivalent lysine of all other protein kinases. The fact that all other kinases contain this essential lysine in beta strand 3 suggests the possibility that the catalytic lysine of protein kinases cannot function in any other position except in the WNK subfamily. To determine if the catalytic lysine of another protein kinase might be functional from the phosphate anchor ribbon, we mutated glycine 35 to lysine (G35K) and lysine 52 to alanine (K52A) in the MAPK ERK2 so that the resulting ERK2 mutant resembles WNKs (Fig. 5A). The activity of this double mutant and several related mutants were compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 5B). Myc-tagged ERK2 was expressed in 293 cells, which were either treated with epidermal growth factor or cotransfected with a constitutively active form of Ras or MEK1. The G35K single mutant showed much reduced activity, whereas the K52A mutant was kinase-defective as shown previously (21Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the G35K/K52A double mutant showed comparable activity to wild type ERK2, indicating that the WNK catalytic lysine placement could function in other kinases such as ERK2. The same mutant was also tested as a purified protein from E. coli for its basal kinase activity. As in mammalian cells, His6-ERK2-G35K/K52A showed comparable activity to wild type ERK2 (data not shown). It is puzzling that this position of the active site lysine yields an active kinase in enzymes other than WNKs. We then wanted to determine if the normal catalytic lysine placement could function in WNK1. To test this possibility, we constructed a WNK1 double mutant K233G/C250K, which eliminates the catalytic lysine from the phosphate anchor ribbon and instead places a lysine in the expected location for the catalytic residue in beta strand 3 (Fig. 6A). As shown before, both the K233M and C250K single mutants were completely kinase-deficient (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). One possibility for the lack of activity of C250K is that the bulk of the two lysine residues results in steric hindrance, preventing either lysine from carrying out normal catalytic function. Thus, we replaced the phosphate anchor ribbon lysine in WNK1 with the residue typically in that position in other kinases, a glycine. Nevertheless, WNK1 K233G/C250K did not exhibit detectable kinase activity, showing that the normal catalytic lysine placement in WNK1 could not restore its activity (Fig. 6B). This is in sharp contrast with the results indicating that the WNK catalytic lysine placement retains kinase activity in ERK2. Other features of the WNK active site must dictate the unique lysine position. We can now propose key elements of the regulatory mechanism of the WNK protein kinases. WNK1 contains an autoinhibitory sequence just C-terminal to the catalytic domain that is conserved in WNKs across species. This autoinhibitory domain suppresses the activity of the kinase domain, which is active once this domain is removed. Activation of WNKs requires autophosphorylation of at least one serine residue, serine 382 in WNK1, within the WNK activation loop. Phosphorylation of serine 378 also promotes increased activity. In addition, WNK1 is probably further activated by phosphorylation on other sites by one or more other protein kinases upon cell stimulation. This is suggested by the fact that S378A/S382A WNK1 consistently undergoes shifts in electrophoretic mobility, typical of quantitative changes in phosphorylation state, when cells are stimulated. Because this mutant has little catalytic activity on its own, its phosphorylation is almost certainly caused by one or more other protein kinases. Many protein kinases contain phosphorylation sites within the activation loop. In some cases these are autophosphorylation sites, and in others these sites are phosphorylated by regulatory enzymes. WNK1 contains one essential and one more minor autophosphorylation site in this loop. WNK1 autophosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). The S378A mutant autophosphorylates as well as wild type WNK1; S382 is highly phosphorylated in WNK1 because it is purified from bacteria; and there are no other serine residues in the activation loop. Thus, we conclude that the autophosphorylation that is detected must occur outside the activation loop, presumably in the serine-rich region N-terminal to the kinase domain. We note that replacement of the essential serine residue in the activation loop with aspartate does not enhance WNK1 activity (data not shown). Substitution of acidic residues for phosphorylated residues creates activated kinases in some cases,e.g. MEK1, but not others, e.g. ERK2 or TAK1 (21Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Google Scholar, 22Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar, 23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Google Scholar). Interestingly, a GST-WNK1-(1–639) fusion protein retained considerable activity, although it also contains the autoinhibitory domain. Preliminary experiments indicate that WNK forms tetramers due to the coiled-coil domain C-terminal to the autoinhibitory domain. Gel filtration of cell lysates reveals that endogenous WNK1 is a tetramer. Recombinant fragments expressed in mammalian cells or in bacteria that retain the coiled-coil domain are also largely tetrameric. Smaller fragments of WNK1 behave as a monomer. At this time, we can only speculate on the mechanism of action of this domain. It seems likely that the formation of tetramers may enhance autoactivation of WNK1. One way in which oligomerization might enhance WNK1 activity is if autophosphorylation of WNK1 is a bimolecular event; intermolecular autophosphorylation controls the activity of several tyrosine kinases (e.g. see Ref. 24Cobb M.H. Sang B.-C. Gonzalez R. Goldsmith E. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18701-18706Google Scholar). This appears not to be so in the case of WNKs, because a kinase-dead WNK1 fragment is not a substrate for an active WNK1 fragment (data not shown). The finding that inclusion of the coiled-coil domain with the isolated autoinhibitory segment decreases autoinhibition of the WNK1 catalytic domain suggests that tetramerization suppresses the function of the autoinhibitory domain. Perhaps the coiled-coil domain interacts with the kinase domain to promote its autoactivation by some other mechanism. Comparing the WNK autoinhibitory domain sequences reveals that conservation is strongest in a ∼50-residue stretch (residues 515–569), which contains two phenylalanine residues that play key roles in autoinhibition. The FXF motif is reminiscent of one type of ERK2 docking domain found in several proteins (25Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Google Scholar). Interestingly, the WNK1 autoinhibitory domain can also inhibit ERK2. This is perhaps not surprising, because it has been previously reported that peptides containing FXF motifs act as inhibitors of ERK2 (25Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Google Scholar, 26Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Google Scholar). On the other hand, this inhibitory domain has little effect on the p38 MAPK, which is not reported to interact with FXF motifs or on the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (not shown). Mutating these two residues to alanines decreases inhibition caused by the isolated autoinhibitory domain and increases the activity of the auto-inhibited WNK1 fragment. We do not yet know if these residues primarily dock the autoinhibitory domain onto the kinase core or if they are involved in the folding of this small domain. The most striking feature of the WNK protein kinase family is that they have the catalytic lysine within the glycine string in beta strand 2 instead of in a more buried position in beta strand 3 (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Google Scholar). We were able to show here that engineering this unique catalytic residue arrangement into ERK2 could result in an active kinase. Interestingly, only the ERK2 G35K/K52A mutant had kinase activity, whereas the G35K/K52R mutant was still kinase-deficient (data not shown). These results suggest that a large side chain at residue 52 will interfere with the function of K35 as the catalytic lysine in ERK2. In contrast, the attempt to convert WNK1 into a kinase with the usual catalytic residue position did not produce an active protein. The WNK1 K233G/C250K mutant, which adopts the normal catalytic lysine arrangement, exhibited no detectable kinase activity. It is possible that the side chain of Trp-249, which just precedes the lysine in this mutant, is incompatible with the proper ATP interactions with Lys when it is placed at residue 250. We are currently exploring the role of this catalytic site arrangement in the regulation of WNK1 activity.

Although the molecular mechanisms controlling T cell cytokine production have been extensively studied, the factors that endow T cells with their ability to produce unique sets of cytokines have not been fully characterized. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-4 is a lymphoid-restricted member of the interferon regulatory factor family of transcriptional regulators, whose deficiency leads to a profound impairment in the ability of mature CD4+ T cells to produce cytokines. In these studies, we have investigated the mechanisms employed by IRF-4 to control cytokine synthesis. We demonstrate that stable expression of IRF-4 in Jurkat T cells not only leads to a strong enhancement in the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-2, but also enables these cells to start producing considerable amounts of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. Transient transfection assays indicate that IRF-4 can transactivate luciferase reporter constructs driven by either the human IL-2 or the human IL-4 promoter. A detailed analysis of the effects of IRF-4 on the IL-4 promoter reveals that IRF-4 binds to a site adjacent to a functionally important NFAT binding element and that IRF-4 cooperates with NFATc1. These studies thus support the notion that IRF-4 represents one of the lymphoid-specific components that control the ability of T lymphocytes to produce a distinctive array of cytokines.

Although most antigen-specific CD4+ T cells have the potential to secrete all of these cytokines, CD4+ T cells exposed to specific microenvironments can differentiate into two distinct subsets, termed T helper 1 (TH1) and T helper 2 (TH2) cells. These two subsets are restricted in the pattern of cytokines that they can produce. Thus TH1 cells secrete IL-2 and IFN-γ but not IL-4, while TH2 cells produce IL-4 (as well as IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13) but not IL-2 or IFN-γ (1Murphy K.M. Ouyang W. Farrar J.D. Yang J.

This family is comprised of four calcium-regulated members, NFAT1 (NFATc2, NFATp), NFAT2 (NFATc1, NFATc), NFAT3 (NFATc4), and NFAT4 (NFATc3, NFATx). Upon activation of T cells, these proteins are rapidly dephosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus. This process is mediated by calcineurin, a calcium-regulated phosphatase, which is a well known target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 (6Kiani A. Rao A. Aramburu J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). NFAT proteins have been shown to be involved in the regulation of several cytokine genes, including IL-2 and IL-4(3Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The regulatory regions of cytokine genes usually contain multiple functionally important NFAT target sequences, for instance, the promoter of the IL-4 gene contains four (to five) distinct NFAT binding sites, termed P0 through P4 (7Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). NFAT proteins bind DNA only weakly and optimal binding and NFAT-mediated transactivation requires their cooperation with additional transcription factors and the formation of “functional enhanceosomes” (8Macian F.

Genomics. 1996; 37: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and genetic studies have demonstrated that IRF-4 is a critical effector of mature lymphocyte function (25Mittrucker H. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T. Potter J. Shahinian A. Wakeham A. Patterson B. Ohashi P. Mak T. Science. 1997; 275: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Studies of the mechanisms employed by IRF-4 to modulate lymphocyte activation have so far primarily focused on its role in B cells. In these cells, IRF-4 is involved in the regulation of genes that display B cell-specific expression/regulation, and that are normally induced in response to B cell activation stimuli (26Pernis A.B. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of IRF-4 to target these genes requires the presence of DNA-bound PU.1, an Ets protein expressed in macrophages and B cells but not in T cells (19Eisenbeis C. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 27Pongubala J.M.R. Beveren C.V. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchinson M.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The interaction of IRF-4 with PU.1 is believed to cause a conformational change in IRF-4 that unmasks its DNA binding domain thus allowing it to target DNA sites containing the core sequence for IRF binding (GAAA) (28Brass A. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C. Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by studies on CD23b, a gene synergistically induced by CD40 and IL-4, IRF-4 may also function in the integration of B cell activation pathways as a result of its ability to participate in the formation of “enhanceosome-like” complexes (23Gupta S. Jiang M. Anthony A. Pernis A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Gupta S. Anthony A. Pernis A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have revealed that IRF-4 plays a fundamental role in the T cell compartment as well (25Mittrucker H. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T. Potter J. Shahinian A. Wakeham A. Patterson B. Ohashi P. Mak T. Science. 1997; 275: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). T cells from IRF-4-deficient mice can undergo early activation events but are unable to complete their activation program and display a profound block in their ability to produce cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ. The mechanisms by which IRF-4 controls the acquisition of T cell effector function have, however, not been fully elucidated.Here, we show that IRF-4 can modulate the expression of T cell cytokine genes by directly targeting their regulatory regions. Stable expression of IRF-4 in T cells lacking endogenous IRF-4 leads to a strong enhancement in the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. Transient transfection assays employing reporter constructs driven by either the IL-2 or IL-4 promoters further demonstrate that the presence of IRF-4 leads to higher inducibility of these constructs. A detailed analysis of the human IL-4 promoter indicates that IRF-4 can bind to DNA elements situated next to well known NFAT binding sites. We furthermore show that IRF-4 can functionally cooperate with the NFATc1 (NFAT2) protein and that the effect of IRF-4 on cytokine production can be blocked by immunosuppressants known to interfere with NFAT activation. Taken together these data are consistent with the notion that IRF-4 can function as a lineage-specific partner for NFAT proteins. Thus, the induction of IRF-4 upon T cell activation is likely to represent one of the critical steps that can endow T cells with the ability to perform their unique set of biologic responses.DISCUSSIONThe synthesis of a distinctive array of cytokines is one of the most characteristic and critical functions of CD4+ T cells (43Noble A. Immunology. 2000; 101: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms involved in T cell cytokine production have been extensively studied (2Glimcher L.H. Murphy K.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1693-1711PubMed Google Scholar, 44Avni O. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the factors that are responsible for the ability of lymphocytes to selectively produce specific cytokines have not been fully elucidated. It has previously been reported that mice deficient in IRF-4, a lymphoid restricted member of the IRF family of transcription factors, display striking disturbances in T cell cytokine production (25Mittrucker H. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T. Potter J. Shahinian A. Wakeham A. Patterson B. Ohashi P. Mak T. Science. 1997; 275: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In these studies, therefore, we set out to investigate the mechanisms by which IRF-4 controls T cell cytokine synthesis. Our results indicate that stable expression of IRF-4 exerts profound effects on the ability of human T cells to produce multiple cytokines, including IL-2 and IL-4. We furthermore show that IRF-4 directly targets the promoters of these cytokines and that its effects require cooperation with NFATc1. Taken together with the information provided by the genetic studies, these data are thus consistent with the notion that IRF-4 represents one of the major lymphoid-restricted regulators of T cell cytokine synthesis.We have shown that stable expression of IRF-4 in human T cells can activate the expression of TH2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13). This is in agreement with two recent reports, which found that IRF-4-deficient T cells are impaired in their ability to differentiatein vitro toward a TH2 phenotype (45Rengarajan J. Mowen K.A. Mcbride K.D. Smith E.D. Singh H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 46Lohoff M. Mittrucker H.-W. Prechtl S. Bischof S. Sommer F. Kock S. Ferrick D.A. Duncan G.S. Gessner A. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11808-11812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This finding is furthermore supported by the fact that similarly to B cells (23Gupta S. Jiang M. Anthony A. Pernis A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), expression of IRF-4 in T cells can be up-regulated upon exposure to IL-4, the most potent TH2 differentiating stimulus. 3S. Jang, unpublished observations., 4A. Dent, personal communication.Interestingly, no induction of IL-5 gene expression was noted in our system suggesting that additional factors may modulate the ability of IRF-4 to target different TH2-types cytokines.Our observations, however, indicate that IRF-4 does not simply function as a TH2-specific factor but it may also participate in the control of TH1-type cytokines because presence of IRF-4 markedly enhanced the induction of IL-2, a cytokine normally associated with the TH1 phenotype. The effect of IRF-4 on human IL-2 production is consistent with the phenotype of T cells from IRF-4 deficient mice, which display a marked impairment in the synthesis of IL-2 (25Mittrucker H. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T. Potter J. Shahinian A. Wakeham A. Patterson B. Ohashi P. Mak T. Science. 1997; 275: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Interestingly, if supplied with exogenous IL-2, IRF-4-deficient T cells are able to produce moderate levels of IL-2 upon restimulation (45Rengarajan J. Mowen K.A. Mcbride K.D. Smith E.D. Singh H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 46Lohoff M. Mittrucker H.-W. Prechtl S. Bischof S. Sommer F. Kock S. Ferrick D.A. Duncan G.S. Gessner A. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11808-11812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One possible scenario reconciling these findings is that the requirements for IRF-4 in the production of individual cytokines may be dynamically regulated as a T cell proceeds along a specific differentiation pathway. For instance, naive T cells may rely more heavily on the presence of IRF-4 for their initial “burst” of IL-2 production whereas differentiated TH1 cells may have evolved additional redundant mechanisms that render the IRF-4 requirement for IL-2 production less stringent. A role for IRF-4 in the control of TH1 cytokine production is further supported by the fact that recent studies have revealed that IRF-4-deficient T cells differentiated in vitro under TH1 conditions display moderate to severe defects in the ability to synthesize IFN-γ, another TH1-type cytokine (45Rengarajan J. Mowen K.A. Mcbride K.D. Smith E.D. Singh H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 46Lohoff M. Mittrucker H.-W. Prechtl S. Bischof S. Sommer F. Kock S. Ferrick D.A. Duncan G.S. Gessner A. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11808-11812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preliminary results indicate that the up-regulation of IRF-4 is differentially controlled in the two TH subsets. Induction of IRF-4 expression in established TH1 cells can occur in response to TCR-mediated signals, but, consistent with the known extinction of IL-4 signaling in these cells (47Huang H. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the IL-4-mediated up-regulation of IRF-4 is no longer detectable. Thus, although IRF-4 can be expressed in both TH1 and TH2 cells, its induction occurs in very distinct molecular milieus, and this, in turn, is likely to profoundly affect its functional capabilities.Our studies indicate that IRF-4 can functionally interact with NFATc1, a member of a well known family of transcription factors known to play a key role in T cell cytokine production (3Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 5Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although NFATc1 was originally identified as a critical regulator of IL-2 gene expression in activated T cells (48Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), subsequent studies have uncovered a much broader biological role for this protein as demonstrated by the fact that lack of NFATc1 results not only in impaired T cell function but also in profound defects in the development of cardiac valves (49de la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Potter J. Wakeham A. Marengere L. Langille B.L. Crabtree G.R. Mak T.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 50Ranger A.M. Grusby M.J. Hodge M.R. Gravallese E.M. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Mickanin C. Baldwin H.S. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Given that NFATc1 expression is not solely confined to lymphocytes, the pairing of a lymphoid-restricted factor like IRF-4 with NFATc1 may thus enable NFATc1 to acquire the ability to exert its actions in a T cell-specific manner. Interestingly, T cell cytokine production is controlled not simply by NFATc1 but by a complex interplay among the different NFAT family members. This is evidenced by in vivo studies showing that lack of different combinations of NFAT proteins can result in either profound deficiencies or marked hyperactivation of T cell effector functions (15Ranger A.M. Oukka M. Rengarajan J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 627-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 16Peng S.L. Gerth A.J. Ranger A.M. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 2001; 14: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 17Rengarajan J. Tang B. Glimcher L.H. Nature Immunol. 2002; 3: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, during the course of these studies another group reported that murine IRF-4 can interact with a different NFAT family member, NFATc2 (45Rengarajan J. Mowen K.A. Mcbride K.D. Smith E.D. Singh H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It will thus be important to determine in in vivo settings whether distinct NFAT proteins can differentially modulate the ability of IRF-4 to drive cytokine production. An intricate association of IRF-4 with distinct members of the NFAT family may underlie the complex defects in TH differentiation observed in IRF-4-deficient mice (46Lohoff M. Mittrucker H.-W. Prechtl S. Bischof S. Sommer F. Kock S. Ferrick D.A. Duncan G.S. Gessner A. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11808-11812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Cooperation of IRF-4 and NFATc1 in IL-4 production is linked to the ability of IRF-4 to target the promoter of this gene at a site adjacent to a well characterized NFAT binding site, P1 (5Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Competition experiments furthermore suggest that IRF-4 complexes can similarly target additional NFAT binding sites present in the IL-4 promoter like P4. Interestingly, both P1 and P4 have been shown to be critical regulatory elements for IL-4 gene expression in response to T cell stimulation and TH2 differentiation (33Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Laur O. Klevenz S. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389PubMed Google Scholar, 51Wenner C.A. Szabo S.J. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar, 52Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar), further supporting a physiologic role for IRF-4 in the control of this cytokine. Given that both IRF-4 and NFATc1 have been reported to possess only weak DNA binding activity (3Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 28Brass A. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C. Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), a likely scenario for their cooperation is that the interaction of NFAT with IRF-4 may facilitate IRF-4 binding to its DNA element and vice versa. This is indeed supported by our EMSA experiments, which demonstrate that addition of the anti-IRF-4 antibody can also affect DNA binding by NFAT (Fig. 5 B) and that lack of IRF-4 blocks the appearance of all P1-IRF inducible complexes (Fig. 5 D). We have furthermore found by glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments that IRF-4 and NFATc1 can physically interact. 5C. Hu, unpublished observations. However, in contrast to what has been reported for the association between murine IRF-4 and NFATc2 (45Rengarajan J. Mowen K.A. Mcbride K.D. Smith E.D. Singh H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we have been unable to coimmunoprecipitate the endogenous proteins suggesting that ternary complex formation with DNA may be necessary to stabilize the IRF-4/NFATc1 interaction. Interestingly, the regions encompassing the P1 and P4 regulatory elements can be targeted by additional transcription factors like AP-1 and NF-κB/Rel proteins (40Szabo S.J. Gold J.S. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 41Rooney J.W. Hoey T. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1995; 2: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 42Li-Weber M. Giasi M. Krammer P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32460-32466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It will thus be important to determine whether IRF-4 may interact with these additional factors as well. We furthermore suspect that, like the case of NFAT proteins (53Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,54Solymar D.C. Agarwal S. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Rao A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), IRF-4 may not simply target cytokine promoters but also additional enhancer elements that are critical for optimal and cell type-specific cytokine expression. The fact that deficiency of IRF-4 was also recently reported to be associated with defects in the up-regulation of GATA3 in TH2 cells (46Lohoff M. Mittrucker H.-W. Prechtl S. Bischof S. Sommer F. Kock S. Ferrick D.A. Duncan G.S. Gessner A. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11808-11812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) suggests that the mechanism employed by IRF-4 to modulate T cell cytokine production is likely to be multifaceted.The ability of IRF-4 to cooperate with NFAT proteins may have important clinical implications. Indeed, addition of cyclosporin A and FK506, two well known NFAT inhibitors (6Kiani A. Rao A. Aramburu J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), completely blocked the ability of IRF-4 to drive cytokine synthesis. These findings suggest that in addition to exerting a direct inhibitory effect on NFAT proteins, these immunosuppressive drugs can also profoundly interfere with the function of tissue-restricted NFAT partners like IRF-4. Given that many of the side effects of cyclosporin A and FK506 have been attributed to inhibition of NFAT proteins in nonlymphoid tissues (6Kiani A. Rao A. Aramburu J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), targeting of the IRF-4/NFAT interaction may thus allow for the development of more selective immunosuppressants and minimize potentially deleterious side effects. The NFAT/IRF-4 interaction might also be a target for HTLVI, an oncogenic retrovirus known to usurp the activation program of T cells (55Copeland K.F. Heeney J.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 722-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hallmark of HTLVI-mediated T cell transformation is the up-regulation of T cell cytokine production, and most notably of IL-2. Tax, the major HTLVI gene product involved in this effect has been shown to up-regulate the expression of IRF-4 in T cells via a pathway involving NF-κB and NFAT (56Mamane Y. Sharma S. Graandvaux N. Hernandez E. Hiscott J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as well as to induce the binding of NFAT-containing complexes to cytokine promoters (57Good L. Maggirwar S.B.

IKACh is a heteromultimeric complex formed by Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 subunits, although Kir3.4 homomultimers have also been proposed to contribute to this conductance. While Kir3.4 homomultimers evince many properties of IKACh, the contribution of Kir3.1 to IKACh is less well understood. Here, we explored the significance of Kir3.1 using knock-out mice. Kir3.1 knock-out mice were viable and appeared normal. The loss of Kir3.1 did not affect the level of atrial Kir3.4 protein but was correlated with a loss of carbachol-induced current in atrial myocytes. Low level channel activity resembling recombinant Kir3.4 homomultimers was observed in 40% of the cell-attached patches from Kir3.1 knock-out myocytes. Channel activity typically ran down quickly, however, and was not recovered in the inside-out configuration despite the addition of GTP and ATP to the bath. Both Kir3.1 knock-out and Kir3.4 knock-out mice exhibited mild resting tachycardias and blunted responses to pharmacological manipulation intended to activate IKACh. We conclude that Kir3.1 confers properties to IKAChthat enhance channel activity and that Kir3.4 homomultimers do not contribute significantly to the muscarinic-gated potassium current.

The heart rate decrease mediated by the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system involves the release of acetylcholine from post-ganglionic cholinergic neurons onto atrial myocytes and sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal cells (1Wickman K. Clapham D. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Google Scholar). Acetylcholine binds M2 muscarinic receptors on these cells, triggering the activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. The activated Gα and Gβγ subunits in turn modulate the function of multiple enzymes and ion channels, including the cardiac G protein-gated, inwardly rectifying potassium channel IKACh (1Wickman K. Clapham D. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Google Scholar). IKACh is one of the most well characterized G protein-regulated ion channels, exhibiting potent activation by Gβγ subunits (2Logothetis D.E.

IKACh is thought to be a heterotetrameric complex formed by the homologous Kir3.1/GIRK1 and Kir3.4/GIRK4 potassium channel subunits (5Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Recent studies, however, have presented evidence for the existence of native G protein-gated potassium channels that do not contain Kir3.1 (13Inanobe A. Yoshimoto Y. Horio Y. Morishige K.I. Hibino H.

Studies in Xenopus oocyte and mammalian cell expression systems have offered some insight into the functional contribution of the Kir3 subunits to IKACh function. Recombinant Kir3.4 homomultimers manifest several key functional properties of IKACh, including coupling to G protein-coupled receptors, gating by Gβγ subunits, inward rectification, and potassium selectivity (7Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar, 16Bender K. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Inanobe A. Meyer T. Kurachi Y. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28873-28880Google Scholar, 17Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Google Scholar, 18Kim D. Watson M. Indyk V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H195-H206Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection of cultured rat atrial myocytes with monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric Kir3.4 expression constructs lead to a loss of acute desensitization of the muscarinic-gated K+ current, a reduction in inward rectification, and a slowing of current activation (16Bender K. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Inanobe A. Meyer T. Kurachi Y. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28873-28880Google Scholar). A comparison of the functional properties of native IKACh and recombinant Kir3.4 homomultimers suggests that Kir3.1 impacts the gating, conductance, and ATP-dependent modulation of the Kir3.1/3.4 heteromultimer (4Wickman K. Iñiguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Google Scholar, 7Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B.

The failure of recombinant Kir3.1 complexes to achieve surface membrane expression has precluded a rigorous examination of their functional properties (7Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar, 19Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Google Scholar). The significance of IKACh to heart rate regulation was demonstrated recently using a mouse knock-out strategy. Kir3.4 knock-out mice lacked cardiac IKACh and exhibited blunted heart rate decreases in response to indirect vagal stimulation and A1 adenosine receptor activation (20Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Google Scholar). The study indicated that IKACh is responsible for a significant fraction of the heart rate decrease associated with these manipulations. Interestingly, Kir3.4 knock-out mice were also unable to alter heart rate significantly on a beat-to-beat time scale, reflected in decreased heart rate variability, and were resistant to atrial fibrillation caused by vagal stimulation (21Kovoor P. Wickman K. Maguire C.T. Pu W. Gehrmann J. Berul C.I. Clapham D.E. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 37: 2136-2143Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine the significance of Kir3.1 to the formation and function of cardiac IKACh. We describe the generation of Kir3.1 knock-out mice and examine the effects of Kir3.1 ablation on Kir3.4 expression, IKACh function, and heart rate regulation. Our findings indicate that Kir3.1 is required for the effective functioning of this cardiac ion channel and argue that Kir3.4 homomultimeric complexes contribute little to the heart rate decrease associated with vagal and A1 adenosine receptor activation. A Cre recombinase-based gene targeting strategy was developed to permit the generation of tissue-specific and/or conditional Kir3.1 knock-out lines. This study, however, describes only the generation of the constitutive nullKir3.1 mutant line. Suitable 5′ and 3′ Kir3.1homology arms were subcloned into a pBluescript-based plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene (NEO) driven by the mouse PGK promoter (kindly provided by M. Picciotto). The NEO cassette was flanked by Cre recombinase recognition sites (loxP sites). The diphtheria toxin (DTA) gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter was included in the construct as a negative selection element to enrich for homologous recombinants as described (20Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Google Scholar, 22Torrecilla M. Marker C. Cintora S. Stoffel M. Williams J. Wickman K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4328-4344Google Scholar). 129Sv/J embryonic stem cells at passage 11 (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) were transfected with the linearized Kir3.1 targeting vector as described (23Spicer A.P. Rowse G.J. Lidner T.K. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30093-30101Google Scholar), and 692 colonies surviving G418 selection (200 μg/ml active constituent for 10 days) were picked, amplified, and screened by PCR and Southern blotting for the appropriate homologous recombination event. A single embryonic stem cell clone (1/692 = 0.14%) harboring the targeted allele was amplified and transfected with a plasmid containing the Cre recombinase cDNA driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (kindly provided by L. Nitschke) to promote one of three potential recombination events: 1) loss of the NEO cassette and Kir3.1 exon, 2) loss of the NEO cassette (Floxed Kir3.1), or 3) loss of Kir3.1exon and retention of the NEO cassette. To enrich for subclones of type 1, Cre-transfected cells were double-plated and evaluated for G418 sensitivity as described (22Torrecilla M. Marker C. Cintora S. Stoffel M. Williams J. Wickman K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4328-4344Google Scholar). Two lines were identified that harbored the null mutant Kir3.1 allele, and both lines were used successfully to generate germline-transmitting chimeric mice. All mice in this study were genotyped either by Southern blotting or by PCR using tail DNA prepared as described (23Spicer A.P. Rowse G.J. Lidner T.K. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30093-30101Google Scholar). Genotyping primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. Adult (8–12-week) mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Hearts were extracted and rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Atrial auricles were removed and homogenized in 2 ml of buffer containing the following (in mm): 100 NaCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CCh, carbachol; ECG, electrocardiogram; CCPA, 2-chloro,N6-cyclopentyl adenosine; bpm, beats per min; HEK, human embryonic kidney. and a protease inhibitor mixture (PIC) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.35 μg/ml), aprotinin (1.7 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). Samples were centrifuged at low speed (2200 × g) to remove large debris. To solubilize contractile elements, 1 ml of a 3 m KCl solution was added, and samples were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. The crude membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 × gfor 30 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of a 2% SDS solution (pre-warmed to 37 °C) containing 1 mm DTT and PIC. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to remove insoluble contents. Protein concentrations were determined using the Lowry assay following trichloroacetic acid precipitation (Sigma). Immunoblotting was performed using NuPage reagents according to manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). Samples were heated to 70 or 100 °C, in the presence of 50 or 100 mmDTT for 10 min prior to loading as indicated. Three micrograms of protein per well were loaded onto 4–12% BisTris gradient gels. Proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) under reducing conditions. Membranes were blocked for 1 h using a 5% milk solution. Anti-Kir3.1 (Alomone Laboratories; Jerusalem, Israel) and anti-m2 muscarinic receptor (Sigma) antibodies were used at 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions, respectively. The anti-Kir3.4 antibody was raised against an amino-terminal synthetic peptide (YIPIATDRTRLLTEGKKPRQ), affinity-purified using the Sulfolink kit (Pierce), and used at a concentration of 3 μg/ml. Membranes were incubated in primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed with TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20), exposed to an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:6000; Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with TBST. Protein bands were revealed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents according to manufacturer's specifications (AmershamBiosciences) using BIOMAX MR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.; Rochester, NY). Breeding pairs consisting of wild-type C57BL/6J mice, Kir3.1 knock-out, or Kir3.4 knock-out parents were established to generate litters of mice of defined genotype. Genotype was verified by PCR of tail samples as described (20Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Google Scholar). Atrial auricles from four-six neonatal mice (postnatal day 2–4) were microdissected from total heart tissue. Myocytes were isolated using the neonatal rat cardiac myocyte isolation kit (Worthington Biochemical Corporation; Lakewood, NJ), with minor modifications to the manufacturer's protocol designed to accommodate the smaller amount of starting tissue. Briefly, atrial tissue was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 5 ml of trypsin solution (25 μg/ml). The next morning, 500 μg/ml of trypsin inhibitor and 75 units/ml of purified collagenase were added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking. Subsequently, cells were filtered through a strainer to remove undigested tissue and then counted. Cells were sedimented at 50–100 × g for 5 min and resuspended in L-15 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Isolated cells were plated at a density of 400,000 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 24–48 h prior to electrophysiological testing. For whole-cell recordings, patch pipettes (3–5 megohms) were filled with a solution containing the following (in mm): 130 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 EGTA/KOH (pH 7.2), 0.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/KOH (pH 7.2), 2 Na2ATP, 5 phosphocreatine, 0.2 NaGTP. The low K+ bath solution consisted of the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5.5 d-glucose, 5 HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4). The high K+ bath solution consisted of the following (in mm): 120 NaCl, 25.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5.5 d-glucose, 5 HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4). Where indicated, 20 μm carbachol (CCh; Sigma) was added to the bath solution. Bath/drug solutions were applied rapidly with an SF-77B Perfusion Fast-Step system (Warner Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Cells were visualized using an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope. Whole-cell currents were detected with an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA), low pass-filtered at 1 kHz, and sampled at 2 kHz with pCLAMP, version 8.0 software. CCh-induced currents in the low K+ bath solution were measured in voltage-clamp mode with the membrane potential held at −90 or −50 mV to observe inward and outward currents, respectively. CCh-induced currents in the high K+ bath solution were measured in voltage-clamp mode with the membrane potential held at −90 mV. Peak currents evoked by consecutive applications of CCh (separated by a 15–30-s washout) were averaged to obtain the CCh-induced current. Current-voltage plots of CCh-induced currents were obtained by subtracting baseline traces from CCh-induced currents evoked by a voltage pulse protocol (−120 to +80 mV in 20-mV increments, 300 ms per step). The holding potential for current-voltage determinations was −80 mV. For single channel recordings, patch pipettes (4–8 megohms) were filled with a solution containing the following (in mm): 150 KCl, 1 EGTA/KOH (pH 7.2), 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES/KOH (pH 7.2), and 20 μm CCh. The bath solution contained the following (in mm): 150 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5.5 d-glucose, 5 HEPES/KOH (pH 7.2). The bath solution was supplemented with either 0.2 mm GTP or 0.2 mm GTP + 1 mm K2-ATP to examine the G protein dependence of measured currents and the possible regulation by ATP-dependent processes, respectively. In some experiments, 1–10 μm guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate replaced the 0.2 mmGTP in the bath. Single channel currents were low pass-filtered at 5 kHz and stored directly onto videotape using an Instrutech VR-10B digital data recorder (Instrutech Corporation; Long Island, NY). Single channel currents were sampled at 10 kHz and stored on computer hard drive for subsequent analysis of conductance, open time, and open probability using pCLAMP, version 8.0 software. Implantable PhysioTel TA10EA-F20 radiotransmitters (Data Sciences International; St. Paul, MN) were used for the ECG telemetry monitoring as described previously (20Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Google Scholar). Briefly, transmitters were implanted under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (30–50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. ECG leads were sutured to the thoracic muscles in lead II position. Prolene 5–0 was used to close the incisions. Mice were allowed to recover for 7 days prior to measuring resting heart rate. For resting heart rate determination, 6 h of baseline ECG recording began in the morning of day 8 (1000–1600). On day 9, heart rate was monitored for 15 min prior to intraperitoneal injection of 6 mg/kg methoxamine (Sigma) and for 2 h after injection. On day 10, heart rate was monitored for 15 min prior to intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mg/kg 2-chloro,N6-cyclopentyl adenosine (CCPA; resuspended in 0.1% Me2SO) and for 2 h following injection. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and transmitters were explanted and reused after cleaning and sterilization with 2% glutaraldehyde. All electrophysiological and electrocardiogram data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's HSD post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons. The level of significance was considered as p < 0.05. We reported recently the structure of the mouse Kir3.1gene (24Wickman K. Pu W. Clapham D. Gene. 2002; 284: 241-250Google Scholar). A Cre-loxP-based targeting strategy involving the third exon of Kir3.1 was utilized to generate constitutive nullKir3.1 mutant mice (Fig. 1A) (25Picciotto M.R. Wickman K. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1131-1163Google Scholar). Exon 3 was chosen for targeting as it contains a protein-coding sequence for most of the key functional domains of the Kir3.1 subunit, including the pore and membrane-spanning domains, the entire amino terminus, and the translation initiation codon (Fig. 1B). A single targeted embryonic stem cell clone was identified (1/692 = 0.14% targeting efficiency) and was transfected subsequently with a Cre recombinase cDNA expression construct. Two derivative subclones harboring the null version of Kir3.1 were identified and used to generate chimeric mice and subsequently, constitutive Kir3.1 knock-out mice. Wild-type and null versions of the Kir3.1 gene were distinguished by Southern blotting (Fig. 1C). Kir3.1 knock-out mice appeared normal with respect to size, grooming behavior, and responses to visual and sound cues (data not shown). Both Kir3.1 knock-out male and female mice are fertile, and breeding pairs of homozygous null Kir3.1 mutant parents yielded normal litter sizes. Western blots of crude atrial membrane extracts from wild-type and Kir3.1 knock-out mice confirmed the success of the gene targeting (n = 5; see Fig. 2,left panel). All Kir3.1 immunoreactivity was absent in samples from Kir3.1 knock-out mice. Interestingly, the pattern of Kir3.4 immunoreactivity was altered in samples from Kir3.1 knock-out mice (n = 4; see Fig. 2, middle panel). In wild-type samples, Kir3.4 immunoreactivity was observed predominantly as a 45-kDa band, with a small amount of immunoreactivity observed at a high molecular mass (>200 kDa). This pattern of Kir3.4 immunoreactivity has been reported previously and was interpreted to represent a fraction of Kir3.4 that exists as homomultimers in heart tissue (15Corey S. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27499-27504Google Scholar). In Kir3.1 knock-out samples, most of the Kir3.4 immunoreactivity was observed at higher molecular masses (∼90 kDa, >200 kDa), consistent with the observation that Kir3.4 homomultimeric complexes are more resistant to denaturing gel electrophoresis than heteromultimeric complexes containing both Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 (15Corey S. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27499-27504Google Scholar). Prolonged incubation of the samples in 100 mm DTT at 100 °C, however, converted all Kir3.4 immunoreactivity into a single band corresponding to monomeric Kir3.4 (n = 2; see Fig. 2, right panel). The total level of Kir3.4 protein in heart tissue from Kir3.1 knock-out mice was unchanged relative to the level observed in wild-type atrial tissue. Resting membrane potentials and CCh-induced currents were measured in primary cultures of atrial myocytes isolated from wild-type and Kir3.1 knock-out mice to determine whether the loss of Kir3.1, and the presence of a homogeneous population of Kir3.4 homomultimeric complexes, correlated with altered electrophysiology. The average resting membrane potential of wild-type atrial myocytes was −62 ± 3 mV (n = 21). In comparison, atrial myocytes from Kir3.1 knock-out (−54 ± 3 mV, n = 18) and Kir3.4 knock-out (−53 ± 4 mV, n = 10) mice were slightly depolarized at rest. There was, however, no statistically significant difference between the resting membrane potentials of myocytes from wild-type, Kir3.1 knock-out (p = 0.13), and Kir3.4 knock-out (p = 0.19) mice (Table I).Table ISummary of whole-cell, electrophysiological properties of atrial myocytes from wild-type, Kir3.1 knock-out, and Kir3.4 knock-out miceGenotypeRMPCCh-induced current density pA/pFVhold = −50 mV ([K+]out = 5.4 mm)Vhold = −90 mV ([K+]out = 5.4 mm)Vhold = −90 mV ([K+]out = 25.4 mm)mVWild-type−62 ± 3 (21)2.5 ± 0.3 (18)−4.7 ± 0.7 (20)−52.0 ± 7.8 (12)Kir3.1 ko−54 ± 3 (18)0.1 ± 0.1ap < 0.001, wild-type vs.Kir3 knock-out.

Open table in a new tab In a physiological extracellular K+ (5.4 mm) bath solution, 20 μm CCh reliably evoked small outward currents (2.5 ± 0.3 pA/pF, n = 18; Vhold = −50 mV) and larger inward currents (−4.7 ± 0.7 pA/pF, n = 20; Vhold = −90 mV) from wild-type atrial myocytes (see Table I and Fig. 3, A, C, andD). In contrast, CCh did not elicit comparable whole-cell currents under these conditions in Kir3.1 knock-out atrial myocytes (see Table I and Fig. 3, B and D). Indeed, in nine of ten experiments, CCh failed to evoke measurable current or induced small changes in holding current that did not reverse upon agonist withdrawal and/or were not reproducible. In one experiment, however, small (<5 pA) whole-cell currents of appropriate sign were evoked repeatedly by CCh at both holding potentials (data not shown). No measurable CCh-induced current was observed in Kir3.4 knock-out myocytes (n = 10; see Table I and Fig. 3D), consistent with the single channel analysis of Kir3.4 knock-out atrial myocytes that indicated a complete loss of cardiac IKACh in this mutant mouse line (20Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Google Scholar). CCh-induced, whole-cell currents were measured in a high extracellular K+ (25.4 mm) bath solution to facilitate the observation of small inward potassium currents. CCh reliably induced large inward currents (−52 ± 7 pA/pF; Vhold = −90 mV) in wild-type atrial myocytes (n = 12; see Table Iand Fig. 4A). Voltage pulse protocols revealed the strong inward rectification of the CCh-induced current (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, CCh did not induce comparable currents in either Kir3.1 (0.63 ± 0.4 pA/pF, n = 23; p < 0.001) or Kir3.4 (-0.01 ± 0.3, n = 13; p < 0.001) knock-out atrial myocytes. There was no significant difference between the CCh-induced currents observed in myocytes from Kir3.1 knock-out and Kir3.4 knock-out mice under these conditions (p = 0.99). Because the level of Kir3.4 protein was unaltered in Kir3.1 knock-out atrial tissue (Fig. 2), we speculated that the failure to measure significant whole-cell current in Kir3.1 knock-out atrial myocytes was because of the perfusion of critical intracellular elements. Thus, we examined CCh-induced single channel activity in cell-attached patches from wild-type and Kir3 knock-out myocytes. Robust IKACh-like channel activity induced by 20 μmCCh was observed in 17 of 19 cell-attached patches from wild-type atrial myocytes (Fig. 5A). These channels exhibited inward rectification, a 1.0 ± 0.1-ms mean open time, and a 35 ± 12% decrease in open probability over a 1-min interval. Upon formation of the inside-out patch, GTP-dependent gating was observed readily, and single channel conductance (36 ± 1 pS) and channel mean open time (1.1 ± 0.1 ms) were consistent with previous studies of rodent IKACh (4Wickman K. Iñiguez-Lluhi J. Davenport P. Taussig R.A. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Google Scholar, 20Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Google Scholar). In contrast, IKACh-like channels were not observed in cell-attached patches from Kir3.1 knock-out myocytes (n= 24). In nine of 24 cell-attached patches from Kir3.1 knock-out mice, however, channels with the distinctive gating and conductance profile of recombinant Kir3.4 homomultimers were observed (Fig. 5B) (7Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar, 17Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Google Scholar). Comparable channel activity was not observed in cell-attached patches from Kir3.4 knock-out myocytes (n = 14), nor was this activity reported in a previous study of Kir3.4 knock-out myocytes (20Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Google Scholar). The open probability of the residual channel observed in Kir3.1 knock-out myocytes was very low (Po < 0.001), and channel activity typically ran down within 1 min of gigaseal formation. Furthermore, we were unable to recover reliably channel activity in the inside-out configuration despite the addition of 0.2 mm GTP (n = 8) or 0.2 mm GTP + 1 mmATP (n = 7) to the bath. The presence of an active, small conductance, non-rectifying channel in >50% of all patches tested (both wild-type and Kir3 knock-out myocytes) made it difficult to analyze rigorously the single channel properties of the residual channel. In one instance, however, we did observe persistent channel activity in the inside-out configuration, and the activity was dependent upon GTP. In this experiment, single channel conductance was determined to be 17 ± 4 pS, and mean open time was 0.6 ± 0.1 ms, consistent with the properties of the recombinant Kir3.4 homomultimer (7Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Google Scholar, 17Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2008635369,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis that leads to renal fibrosis. Intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in this process remain incompletely understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a major stress signal-transducing pathway, and we have previously reported activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-β1 in rat mesangial cells and its role in the stimulation of pro-α1(I) collagen. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of p38 MAPK activation by TGF-β1 and the role of MKK3, an upstream MAPK kinase of p38 MAPK, by examining the effect of targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene. We first isolated glomerular mesangial cells from MKK3-null (Mkk3−/−) and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) control mice. Treatment with TGF-β1 induced rapid phosphorylation of MKK3 as well as p38 MAPK within 15 min in cultured wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mouse mesangial cells. In contrast, TGF-β1 failed to induce phosphorylation of either MKK3 or p38 MAPK in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells, indicating that MKK3 is required for TGF-β1-induced p38 MAPK activation. TGF-β1 selectively activated the p38 MAPK isoforms p38α and p38δ in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells, but not in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mesangial cells. Thus, activation of p38α and p38δ is dependent on the activation of upstream MKK3 by TGF-β1. Furthermore, MKK3 deficiency resulted in a selective disruption of TGF-β1-stimulated up-regulation of pro-α1(I) collagen expression but not TGF-β1 induction of fibronectin and PAI-1. These data demonstrate that the MKK3 is a critical component of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, and its activation is required for subsequent p38α and p38δ MAPK activation and collagen stimulation by TGF-β1.

We first isolated glomerular mesangial cells from MKK3-null (Mkk3−/−) and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) control mice. Treatment with TGF-β1 induced rapid phosphorylation of MKK3 as well as p38 MAPK within 15 min in cultured wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mouse mesangial cells. In contrast, TGF-β1 failed to induce phosphorylation of either MKK3 or p38 MAPK in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells, indicating that MKK3 is required for TGF-β1-induced p38 MAPK activation. TGF-β1 selectively activated the p38 MAPK isoforms p38α and p38δ in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells, but not in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mesangial cells. Thus, activation of p38α and p38δ is dependent on the activation of upstream MKK3 by TGF-β1. Furthermore, MKK3 deficiency resulted in a selective disruption of TGF-β1-stimulated up-regulation of pro-α1(I) collagen expression but not TGF-β1 induction of fibronectin and PAI-1. These data demonstrate that the MKK3 is a critical component of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, and its activation is required for subsequent p38α and p38δ MAPK activation and collagen stimulation by TGF-β1.

Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Google Scholar, 2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). In mammals, three major subgroups of MAPK superfamily members have been identified: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), also known as p44/42 MAPK, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 MAPK. ERK1/2 is prototypically activated through a Ras-dependent pathway by mitogenic stimuli and growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Google Scholar, 4Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11362-11368Google Scholar). Whereas, JNK and p38 MAPK are activated predominantly by environmental stresses such as osmotic changes, UV radiation, and heat shock, and also by a variety of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), and participate in regulation of cytokine production, T cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis (5Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Google Scholar, 6Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar, 7McDermott E.P. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7808-7815Google Scholar). Recent investigations including ours have revealed that p38 MAPK can be activated by the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which regulates numerous cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (8Ravanti L.

Kidney Int. 2000; 58: S53-S58Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is also a potent inducer of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and participates in pathological processes as a central mediator of tissue response to injury and progressive fibrosis in a variety of tissues, including the kidney (12Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of p38 MAPK has been demonstrated in several disease models, including inflammation, septic shock, ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion, and vascular injury (13Ju H. Nerurkar S. Sauermelch C.F. Olzinski A.R. Mirabile R. Zimmerman D. Lee J.C. Adams J. Sisko J. Berova M. Willette R.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 15-20Google Scholar, 14Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6272-6279Google Scholar). In these studies, p38 activation in key cell types correlated with disease initiation and progression, and inhibitors of p38 MAPK were shown to attenuate both p38 activation and disease severity. Recently, evidence for the involvement of activated p38 MAPK in renal response to injury has been accumulating as well. For instance, activation of p38 MAPK has been demonstrated in ischemic and ischemic-reperfused rat kidneys (15Yin T. Sandhu G. Wolfgang C.D. Burrier A. Webb R.L. Rigel D.F. Hai T. Whelan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19943-19950Google Scholar). Increased p38 MAPK activation was also detected in glomeruli isolated from rats with experimental proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy (16Bokemeyer D. Guglielmi K.E. McGinty A. Sorokin A. Lianos E. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: S189-S191Google Scholar, 17Dunlop M.E. Muggli E.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 464-475Google Scholar). Four major isoforms of p38 MAPK have been identified through molecular cloning studies: p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ (18Wang X.S. Diener K. Manthey C.L. Wang S. Rosenzweig B. Bray J. Delaney J. Cole C.N. Chan-Hui P.Y. Mantlo N. Lichenstein H.S. Zukowski M. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23668-23674Google Scholar, 19Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Google Scholar). Each of the p38 isoforms contains the Thr-Gly-Tyr canonical site, and activation is associated with dual phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues. The p38β, p38 γ, and p38δ share homology (73, 63, and 62% amino acid identity, respectively) with p38α (20Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). The p38α and p38β isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p38δ has restricted expression predominantly to the kidney and lung, while p38γ is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle (19Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Google Scholar, 20Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that these isoforms represent related, but distinct MAPK subgroups, and the signal transduction pathways leading to p38 MAPK activation are diverse, overlapping, and depend on cell types and stressor. Activation of the p38 MAPK involves phosphorylation by upstream MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) in the protein kinase cascade and include MKK3, MKK6, and possibly MKK4. Among the different MAPKK subtypes, MKK3 and MKK6 are thought to play the predominant role in activating p38 MAPK (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanism accounting for signaling specificity by the p38 MAPK pathway may involve the selectivity of MKK3 and/or MKK6 to activate distinct p38 MAPK isoforms. In the present study, we explored the mechanism of activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by TGF-β1 and the role of MKK3 by examining the effect of targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene. Utilizing glomerular mesangial cells isolated from MKK3-null (Mkk3−/−) and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) control mice, we show that TGF-β1 rapidly and strongly phosphorylated MKK3 and p38 MAPK and that activation of MKK3 is required for TGF-β1-induced p38 MAPK activation. TGF-β1 selectively activated the p38 MAPK isoforms, p38α and p38δ, and both were dependent on the activation of MKK3 by TGF-β1. Furthermore, MKK3 deficiency resulted in a selective disruption of TGF-β1-stimulated up-regulation of pro-α1(I) collagen expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the MKK3 functions as a critical component of TGF-β1 signaling pathway and that its activation is required for subsequent p38α and p38δ MAPK activation and collagen stimulation by TGF-β1. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The phosphospecific MKK3/MKK6 (Ser189/207) antibodies, MKK3 antibodies, phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), p38 MAPK antibodies, phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), p44/42 MAPK antibodies, phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), JNK rabbit polyclonal antibodies, phospho-ATF2 (Thr71) antibodies, and ATF2 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). The p38α antibodies (c-20, sc-535), p38β antibodies (c-16, sc-6176), and protein A/G-agarose for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p38δ and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Glomerular mesangial cells were isolated and characterized as previously described (10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar), from glomeruli of MKK3-null (Mkk3−/−) mice and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) control mice (22Lu H.-T. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Gatti E. Mellman I. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1845-1857Google Scholar) and from C57BL/6 mice, using differential sieving technique with the following modifications. Following collagenase digestion, the cells were plated in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Bio-Whittaker), insulin (10 μg/ml), 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin, and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Using this technique, we have been successful in establishing homogeneous cultures of glomerular mesangial cells that immunostain for anti-vimentin (Dako) and anti-myosin antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and negative staining for cytokeratin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and von Willebrand's factor (Dianova) as well as negative fluorescent acetylated LDL uptake (Biomedical Technologies Inc.) (10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar). Cells between 7 and 16 passages were used for the experiments. The targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene by homologous recombination and the generation of Mkk3(−/−) mice were as previously described (22Lu H.-T. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Gatti E. Mellman I. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1845-1857Google Scholar). The cells (4 × 104) were plated in 100-mm dishes and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin. Cells grown to subconfluence were rendered quiescent in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, followed by treatment with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for varying time periods. Total cellular extracts were obtained by lysis of cells in buffer containing 1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 m dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue. 20-μg protein samples from each group were boiled for 5 min and were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels, then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated overnight with phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-MKK3/6, phospho-ATF2, phospho-p42/44 MAPK, and phospho-JNK rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:1000), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h. Signal development was carried out using LumiGLO (Cell Signaling Technologies) and exposure to x-ray film. All of the assays were repeated three times, and representative blots are shown. As a control, all of the blots were subjected to immunoblotting for corresponding nonphospho-p38 MAPK, -MKK3, -ATF2, -p44/42 MAPK, and -JNK rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The cells (4 × 104) were plated in 100-mm dishes and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin. Cells grown to subconfluence were rendered quiescent in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, followed by treatment with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 30 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aproptinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF). The cell lysates were passed through 21-gauge needles several times, then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). 200-μg protein samples for each group were incubated with anti-p38α (2 μg/ml), anti-p38β (2 μg/ml), and anti-p38δ (4 μg/ml) antibodies for 1 h on a rocker at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose were added to each sample and were continued incubating on a rocker overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate complexes were washed four times and mixed with 1× electrophoresis buffer, then boiled for 2–3 min. The protein samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the membranes were washed 4–5 times (30 min each) with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. Signal development was carried out using LumiGLO and exposure to x-ray film. Three independent experiments were performed with essentially the same results, and representative blots are shown in Fig. 3. The cells (4 × 104) were plated in 100-mm dishes, and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin. After cells reached subconfluence, they were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum in the absence or in the presence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 24 h. Total RNA in each group was isolated by cell lysis with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was size-fractionated (15 μg/lane) on a 1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gel in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2). mRNA was transferred and UV cross-linked to nylon membranes (Gene Screen Plus; Dupont). The blots were prehybridized for 2 h in Church Gilbert's hybridization buffer (Quality Biological, Inc.) and hybridized overnight in the same solution containing the appropriate32P-labeled probe at 65 °C. The blots were then washed two times in solution containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 1mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 30 min each at 65 °C, followed by 15-min washes with solution containing 1% SDS, 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at 65 °C. The blots were exposed to Kodak X-AR film. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments and representative blots are shown in Fig. 6. To control for relative equivalence of RNA loading, the same blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the 18 S rRNA as previously described (10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar). We first determined whether the p38 MAPK pathway is activated by TGF-β1 in cultured mouse mesangial cells. The levels of p38 MAPK protein expression in mouse mesangial cells treated with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) was determined by Western blot analyses using phospho-p38 MAPK and p38 MAPK antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 A, exposure to TGF-β1 stimulated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK within 15 min. We next determined whether the upstream MAPK kinase MKK3 was also rapidly activated by TGF-β1 using Western blot analyses with phospho-MKK3/6 and MKK3 antibodies. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that treatment with TGF-β1 also resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of MKK3 in mouse mesangial cells. To investigate the functional role of MKK3 in the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, we examined the effect of targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene. We isolated mesangial cells from wild-type (Mkk3+/+) and MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mice, and first confirmed the specific absence of MKK3 activation in the Mkk3−/− mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, increases in phosphorylation of MKK3 were observed within 15 min of treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mouse mesangial cells. In contrast, no phosphorylated MKK3 proteins were detected in the MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells. We next determined whether TGF-β1 nonetheless activated p38 MAPK in the absence of activation of MKK3. Fig. 2 B demonstrates that while treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mouse mesangial cells, no increases in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK were observed within the same time period in the MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells. A higher concentration of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) also resulted in rapid phosphorylation of MKK3 and p38 MAPK in the wild-type (Mkk3+/+) cells, but still failed to induce phosphorylation of either MKK3 or p38 MAPK in the Mkk3−/− cells (data not shown). Our data indicate that MKK3 is required for activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-β1 in mouse mesangial cells. Immunoblotting with p38 MAPK antibodies was performed for loading controls, and Fig. 2 Cshows no changes in the expression of total (phosphorylation state-independent) p38 MAPK proteins. We next sought to investigate the specific p38 MAPK isoform(s) activated by TGF-β1 in mouse mesangial cells. The three major isoforms of p38 MAPK, p38α, p38β, and p38δ, were isolated by immunoprecipitation with the respective antibodies, and phosphorylation of the p38 isoforms by TGF-β1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mouse mesangial cells, treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 resulted in increases of phosphorylated forms of p38α and p38δ MAPK isoforms (Fig.3, A and C). However, in the MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells, the TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of p38α and p38δ MAPK isoforms was abrogated, indicating that MKK3 mediates the activation of both p38α and p38δ. Interestingly, no appreciable increases in phosphorylation of p38β MAPK isoform were observed in either cell type (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblotting with p38 MAPK antibodies for the detection of total (phosphorylation state-independent) p38 MAPK proteins was performed for loading controls (Fig. 3 C). Our results demonstrate that TGF-β1 selectively activates p38α and p38δ isoforms in mesangial cells. Moreover, the results in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells indicate that the predominant upstream MAPK kinase mediating the activation of p38 isoforms by TGF-β1 is MKK3. To explore the downstream targets of activated MKK3-p38 MAPK by TGF-β1, here we examined the activation of ATF2, a downstream nuclear target of p38 MAPK, and the effect of targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene. In wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mouse mesangial cells, treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 induced the phosphorylation of ATF2 (Fig. 4). However, in the MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells, the TGF-β1-induced ATF2 phosphorylation was inhibited, suggesting that the activation of the downstream target ATF-2 by TGF-β1 in mesangial cells is dependent on MKK3. Previous reports, including studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that other MAPK family members ERK1/2 and JNK are activated by TGF-β1 in various cell types (4Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11362-11368Google Scholar, 10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar, 23Hartsough M.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the targeted disruption of the Mkk3gene caused any changes in the expression and activation of ERK1/2 and JNK. We observed that in both wild-type (Mkk3+/+) and MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mouse mesangial cells, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was strongly induced by TGF-β1 within 5 min of treatment (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, no appreciable increases in phosphorylation of JNK were observed within the same time period in either of the cell types (Fig.5 B). Taken together, these data demonstrate thatMkk3 gene disruption caused a specific MKK3 deficiency in the absence of changes in the expression and activation of the other MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK. Mesangial cells are capable of synthesizing ECM proteins, and TGF-β1 induces the synthesis of ECM proteins including collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and proteoglycans in various types of cells (10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar, 25Ignotz R.A. Endo T. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6443-6446Google Scholar, 26Border W.A. Okuda S. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 689-695Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of the MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway in the induction of pro-α1(I) collagen, fibronectin, and PAI-1 expression by TGF-β1 in mouse mesangial cells. As shown in Fig.6 A, treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) increased pro-α1(I) collagen mRNA expression in the control wild-type mouse mesangial cells. Similarly, exogenous TGF-β1 also increased fibronectin (Fig. 6 B) and PAI-1 (Fig. 6 C) mRNA expression in the wild-type mesangial cells. However, in the MKK3-deficient mesangial cells, the same increase in pro-α1(I) collagen expression was not observed, while both fibronectin and PAI-1 expression increased with TGF-β1 treatment. A higher concentration of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) also failed to induce pro-α1(I) collagen expression in the Mkk3−/− cells (data not shown). Together, our data suggest a critical role for the MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway in mediating collagen stimulation by TGF-β1. TGF-β1, a 25-kDa homodimeric polypeptide, is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates a wide variety of cellular functions, including inhibition and stimulation of cell growth, as well as induction of cellular differentiation, and ECM protein synthesis. Recent evidence has suggested a fundamental role for TGF-β1 as a critical mediator of tissue response to injury and pathological processes such as inflammation, wound repair, tumorigenesis, and tissue fibrosis (27Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar, 28Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1017-1021Google Scholar, 29Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M.

Sporn M.B. Ward J.M. Karlsson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 770-774Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for signaling the multiple TGF-β1 actions remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined the role of a major stress-activated intracellular signaling system, the p38 MAPK pathway, in transducing TGF-β1 actions. We first established that TGF-β1 is capable of activating the p38 MAPK in glomerular mesangial cells, a major target cell type is a variety of renal glomerular injury. We show that treatment with TGF-β1 rapidly (within 15 min) induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in cultured murine mesangial cells (Fig.1 A). We also show a concurrent increase in the phosphorylation of the immediate upstream MAPK kinase MKK3 within the same time period of TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 1 B). The rapid kinetics of activation of both MKK3 and p38 MAPK provide support for direct activation by TGF-β1. To explore the mechanism of activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by TGF-β1 and the functional role of MKK3 in TGF-β1 signal transduction, we employed a genetic approach of targeted gene disruption of the MKK3. We isolated mesangial cells from wild-type (Mkk3+/+) and MKK3-null (Mkk3−/−) mice, and first confirmed the specific absence of activated MKK3 protein in theMkk3−/− mesangial cells, in contrast to the wild-type cells (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, in the absence of activation of MKK3, TGF-β1 was unable to induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig.2 B) indicating that activation of MKK3 by TGF-β1 is a requirement for activation of p38 MAPK. The basal levels of phosphorylated p38 detected in Mkk3−/− mesangial cells reflect activities of MAPK kinases other than MKK3, such as MKK6 previously demonstrated to be expressed normally inMkk3−/− mice (22Lu H.-T. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Gatti E. Mellman I. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1845-1857Google Scholar). Activated p38 MAPKs phosphorylate specific downstream targets, including many transcription factors, translation factors, and other kinases to elicit cellular responses (1Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Google Scholar,2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effects of Mkk3 gene disruption on TGF-β1 activation of a downstream nuclear target of p38 MAPK, ATF2. The observed inhibition of TGF-β1-induced activation of transcription factor ATF2 in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mesangial cells suggests that the activation of the downstream target ATF2 by TGF-β1 in mesangial cells is dependent on MKK3 (Fig. 4). Although several MAPK kinases, MKK3, MKK6, and MKK4, may be capable of activating p38 MAPK, differences in the relative contribution of these protein kinases in activating p38 MAPK exist among various stimuli and cell types. For instance, MKK3 is the major activator of p38 in PC-12 cells exposed to osmotic stress, while MKK6 is the dominant activator of p38 in epithelial (KB) cells exposed to osmotic stress, TNF-α, and IL-1, and in monocytes stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (31Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Google Scholar, 32Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4156-4164Google Scholar, 33Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Google Scholar). Whereas MKK4 and MKK7 are thought to activate predominantly the JNK, although few instances of in vitro p38 activation via MKK4 have been reported (34Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar, 35Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Google Scholar, 36Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Google Scholar). The relative contribution of the different MKKs in TGF-β1 activation of the p38 MAPK pathway has not been previously known, and our data demonstrate clearly that the MKK3 specifically activates p38 MAPK in response to stimulation by TGF-β1 in glomerular mesangial cells. Thus, the differential signal transduction pathways initiated by various stimuli that lead to the activation of p38 MAPK by one or several specific MKKs may account for stimulus-specific and cell-specific responses. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the complex signaling mechanisms that mediate multiple TGF-β1 actions are cell- and context-specific (27Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type and stimulus, activated p38 MAPK, like TGF-β1, can exert opposing effects, for instance, to either promote or suppress apoptosis (37Hale K.K. Trollinger D. Rihanek M. Manthey C.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252Google Scholar, 38Guo Y.L. Kang B. Han J. Williamson J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 556-565Google Scholar). These opposing effects of p38 MAPK may be explained by the fact that distinct p38 isoforms can have opposite effects in terms of regulating apoptosis. For example, p38α induces apoptosis of cardiac myocytes, HeLa epithelial cells and Jurkat T cells while p38β suppresses apoptosis in the same cell types (37Hale K.K. Trollinger D. Rihanek M. Manthey C.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252Google Scholar, 38Guo Y.L. Kang B. Han J. Williamson J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 556-565Google Scholar). The expression of multiple p38 MAPK isoforms in mammalian cells, and the different profiles of p38 isoforms expressed in different cell types suggest that these MAPK isoforms differ in their physiological function. The p38 MAPK isoforms may, in addition, be coupled to different upstream signal transduction pathways. This would enable activation of specific p38 MAPK isoforms in response to different stimuli. Alternatively, these p38 MAPK isoforms may differ in their downstream substrate specificity. Such differences could allow coupling of different p38 MAPK isoforms to different signal transduction targets. Thus, the differential activation of the p38 MAPK isoforms can facilitate cell type- and stimulus-specific cellular responses, and may provide a mechanism mediating, in part, the multiple actions of TGF-β1. In the present studies, we observed that TGF-β1 selectively activated the p38 MAPK isoforms, p38α and p38δ (but not p38γ) in wild-type mesangial cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3−/−) mesangial cells TGF-β1 was unable to activate either of the p38 isoforms, indicating that activation of the isoforms p38α and p38δ was dependent on the activation of direct upstream MAPK kinase MKK3 by TGF-β1. Although it had been reported in transformed HeLa and COS-7 cells, using constitutively activated or recombinant MKK3 and MKK6, that MKK3 activates p38α and p38γ, while MKK6 activates p38α, p38β, and p38γ (39Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Google Scholar), little had been previously known if any in other cell types, particularly primary culture-derived cells such as mesangial cells, and in response to stimulation by TGF-β1. Recent studies, including those from our laboratory have demonstrated that other MAPK family members ERK1/2 and JNK are activated by TGF-β1 in various cell types (4Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11362-11368Google Scholar, 10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar, 23Hartsough M.T. Frey R.S. Zipfel P.A. Buard A. Cook S.J. McCormick F. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22368-22375Google Scholar, 24Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Google Scholar). We have previously reported the activation of ERK1/ERK2 by TGF-β1 in cultured macrophages, and demonstrated a critical role of the ERK pathway in signaling the anti-apoptotic effects of TGF-β1 in these cells (4Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11362-11368Google Scholar). We have also reported that TGF-β1 is capable of rapidly activating the ERK1/ERK2 and the p38 MAPK, but not JNK, in glomerular mesangial cells (10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important that we confirmed that our targetedMkk3 gene disruption caused a specific MKK3 deficiency in the absence of changes in the expression and activation of the other MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK (Fig. 5). Investigations of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway have widely utilized pharmacological inhibitors such as the pyridinylimidazole compound SB-203580 to inhibit the function of the p38 MAPK. Using this approach, we had observed that SB-203580 inhibited TGF-β1-induced pro-α1(I) collagen expression and suggested that this TGF-β1 response was via the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway in cultured rat mesangial cells (10Chin B.Y. Mohsenin A. Li S.X. Choi A.M.K. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F495-F504Google Scholar). However, recent findings indicate that SB-203580 can directly inhibit thromboxane synthase, and cyclooxygenases-1 and -2, and thus some of the effects of SB-203580 may not be specifically due to p38 kinase inhibition, but rather due to cyclooxygenase inhibition and alteration in arachidonic acid metabolism (40Börsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Google Scholar). In the present study, we utilized an alternative genetic approach of targetedMkk3 gene disruption. Remarkably, MKK3 deficiency resulted in a selective disruption of TGF-β1-stimulated up-regulation of pro-α1(I) collagen expression (Fig. 6 A), without changes in TGF-β1-induced fibronectin, and PAI-1 expression in murine mesangial cells. (Fig. 6, B and C). These data affirm a critical and selective role for the MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway in mediating collagen stimulation by TGF-β1. Moreover, SB-203580 inhibits p38α and p38β with in vitro IC50values of 0.3–0.6 μm, but has no inhibitory action on p38δ and p38γ (41Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Google Scholar). Thus, our present findings of TGF-β1 activation of p38α and p38δ, but not p38β, together with our previous observations that TGF-β1-induced proα1(I) collagen expression was also inhibited by SB-203580, support a MKK3-p38α MAPK-dependent pathway for collagen stimulation by TGF-β1. To date, little is known regarding the functional role of p38δ. Of particular interest is the relatively restricted expression of p38δ predominantly to the kidney and lung and our present findings of rapid activation of p38δ by TGF-β1 in renal mesangial cells. Interestingly, recent studies report renal up-regulation (26-fold higher than controls) of the p38δ isoform activity in the renal cortex of rats with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis (19Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Google Scholar), a model in which TGF-β1 has been previously demonstrated to be induced. In summary, our data provide strong evidence that TGF-β1 rapidly and strongly activates MKK3 and that this activation of MKK3, but not MKK6, is required for the subsequent activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-β1 in glomerular mesangial cells. The p38 MAPK isoforms, p38α and p38δ, but not p38β, were selectively activated by TGF-β1 and was dependent on MKK3 activation by TGF-β1. Furthermore, MKK3 deficiency selectively inhibited TGF-β1-stimulated up-regulation of pro-α1(I) collagen expression. These data provide clear evidence that the MKK3 functions as a critical component in TGF-β1 signaling and that its activation is a requirement for subsequent p38α and p38δ MAPK activation and collagen stimulation by TGF-β1."

Levels of NPM/B23 mRNA peaked 45–60 min after UV treatment and returned to baseline by 12 h. Transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) prevented the UV-induced increase of NPM/B23 mRNA, suggesting that UV induction of NPM/B23 was mediated at the transcriptional level. Moreover, UV-induced NPM/B23 expression was super-induced by cycloheximide (20 μg/ml), which was characteristic of immediate-early gene response. The transcriptional activation of NPM/B23 by UV was also confirmed by NPM/B23 promoter activity assay. Thymine dinucleotide, mimicking the effects of UV-induced DNA damage, was able to trigger NPM/B23 expression in the absence of genomic DNA damage. UV-induced activation of NPM/B23 promoter could not be blocked by UV-inducible pathway inhibitors, such as those of growth factor tyrosine kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, AP-1, NF-κB, and DNA-dependent kinase. Our results indicate that UV stimulation of NPM/B23 expression may be mediated through a novel UV-inducible pathway and is an immediate-early gene response induced by damaged DNA. Induction of immediate-early gene is an initial step in the regulation of cellular and genomic responses to external stimuli. Our results thus provide important evidence for an involvement of NPM/B23 in the acute response of mammalian cells to environmental stress.

Induction of immediate-early gene is an initial step in the regulation of cellular and genomic responses to external stimuli. Our results thus provide important evidence for an involvement of NPM/B23 in the acute response of mammalian cells to environmental stress. UV irradiation of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells leads to the formation of a variety of DNA photo-products, predominantly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (1Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 221-228Google Scholar). Their repair is accomplished largely through the excision repair system. Although well characterized in prokaryotes as part of the SOS response inducible by UV and DNA damage (2Walker G.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 425-457Google Scholar), excision repair in eukaryotic cells has been defined recently at the biochemical and genetic levels (3Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Google Scholar). The mammalian response, also known as the UV response, is regulated by transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-κB (4Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar, 5Holbrook N.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. New Biol. 1991; 3: 825-833Google Scholar), and p53 (6Fuchs S.Y. Fried V.A. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1483-1490Google Scholar). Activation of both AP-1 and NF-κB by UV is mediated by a signaling pathway in which the membrane-associated Ha-Ras protein plays a major role. Stimulation of Ras leads to activation of cytoplasmic protein kinases that increase AP-1 activity (7Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Google Scholar) and induce nuclear translocation of NF-κB (4Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar, 8Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is involved in a protective function other than DNA repair (7Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Google Scholar). AP-1 transcription factors are products of immediate-early genes. Activation of the immediate-early genes is thought to be an important initial step in the regulation of cellular and genomic responses to external stimulation (5Holbrook N.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. New Biol. 1991; 3: 825-833Google Scholar). UV damages DNA by photo-product formation (1Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 221-228Google Scholar). According to Ljungman and Zhang (9Ljungman M. Zhang F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 823-831Google Scholar), these lesions activate p53 by blocking the transcription of active genes. The small DNA fragment thymine dinucleotide (TT; one of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) induces photoprotective responses in cultured cells and intact skin (10Eller M.S. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 413-414Google Scholar, 11Eller M.S. Maeda T. Magnoni C. Atwal D. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12627-12632Google Scholar). These responses include increase of melanogenesis (10Eller M.S. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 413-414Google Scholar), enhancement of DNA repair capacity (11Eller M.S. Maeda T. Magnoni C.

Dermatol. 1999; 112: 25-31Google Scholar), and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor in the absence of initial genomic DNA damage (11Eller M.S. Maeda T. Magnoni C. Atwal D. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12627-12632Google Scholar). These findings suggest that mammalian cells can generate an SOS-like response to DNA damage, similar to what was previously described in prokaryotic cells (2Walker G.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 425-457Google Scholar), and that p53 is involved in this response in mammalian cells (11Eller M.S. Maeda T. Magnoni C. Atwal D. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12627-12632Google Scholar). Nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM/B23, 1The abbreviations used are: NPM, nucleophosmin; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TT, thymine dinucleotide; mAb, monoclonal anitbody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. also called protein B23), a nucleolar phosphoprotein, is more abundant in cancer cells than in normal resting cells (13Chan W.Y. Liu Q.R. Borjigin J. Busch H. Rennert O.M. Tease L.A. Chan P.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1033-1039Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of NPM/B23 is increased markedly and promptly in association with cellular commitment for mitogensis (14Feuerstein N. Mond J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11389-11397Google Scholar, 15Feuerstein N. Chan P.K. James J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10608-10612Google Scholar). NPM/B23 plays a potential role as a positive regulator of cell proliferation (14Feuerstein N. Mond J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11389-11397Google Scholar, 15Feuerstein N. Chan P.K. James J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10608-10612Google Scholar). Overexpression of NPM/B23 in NIH 3T3 cells results in malignant transformation; thus, NPM/B23 seems to be associated with oncogenic activity (16Kondo T. Minamino N. Nagamura-Inoue T. Matsumoto M. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1275-1281Google Scholar). NPM/B23 inhibits DNA binding and transcriptional activity of interferon regulatory factor-1, which is a tumor suppressor (16Kondo T. Minamino N. Nagamura-Inoue T. Matsumoto M. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1275-1281Google Scholar, 17Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T. Matsuyama T. Lamphier M.S. Aizawa S. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1994; 77: 829-839Google Scholar). Furthermore, NPM/B23 is down-regulated in NIH 3T3 cells during serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (18Chou C.C. Yung B.Y.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 38-45Google Scholar), and in HL-60 cells during sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis (19Liu W.H. Yung B.Y.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3055-3064Google Scholar) or retinoic acid-induced differentiation (20Hsu C.Y. Yung B.Y.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 915-923Google Scholar). NPM/B23 antisense oligonucleotide treatment significantly potentiates the induction of differentiation and apoptosis (18Chou C.C. Yung B.Y.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 38-45Google Scholar, 19Liu W.H. Yung B.Y.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3055-3064Google Scholar, 20Hsu C.Y. Yung B.Y.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 915-923Google Scholar). These studies indicate that NPM/B23 plays a role in the regulation of nucleolar function for cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Searching for genes involved in UV-resistance in human cells with mRNA differential display, Higuchi et al. (21Higuchi Y. Kita K. Nakanishi H. Wang X.L. Sugaya S. Tanzawa H. Yamamori H. Sugita K. Yamaura A. Suzuki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 597-602Google Scholar) have found that expression of NPM/B23 mRNA is induced after UV irradiation in UV-resistant cells but not in control UV-sensitive cells (22Hirano J. Wang X.L. Kita K. Higuchi Y. Nakanishi H. Uzawa K. Yokoe H. Tanzawa H. Yamaura A. Yamamori H. Nakajima N. Nishikiori C. Suzuki N. Cancer Lett. 2000; 153: 183-188Google Scholar). Transfection with NPM/B23 antisense cDNA makes UV-resistant cells become partially sensitive to UV cell-killing. UV-sensitive cells demonstrate lower expression levels of NPM/B23 compared with those of normal fibroblast cells (21Higuchi Y. Kita K. Nakanishi H. Wang X.L. Sugaya S. Tanzawa H. Yamamori H. Sugita K. Yamaura A. Suzuki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 597-602Google Scholar). In addition, increased phosphorylation and poly(ADP) ribosylation of NPM/B23 are observed after x-ray treatment of mammalian cells (23Ramsamooj P. Natario V. Dritschilo A. Radiat. Res. 1995; 143: 158-164Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that NPM/B23 is rapidly up-regulated after UV irradiation as p53, c-Jun, or proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (24Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Yung B.Y.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 93-100Google Scholar). We also have demonstrated that NPM/B23 against UV irradiation is associated with enhancement of DNA repair and up-regulation of proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (24Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Yung B.Y.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 93-100Google Scholar, 25Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Chou C.C. Yung B.Y.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 297-305Google Scholar). NPM/B23 could be a key molecule involved in regulating cellular susceptibility to UV irradiation. The biochemical and molecular events involved in cellular responses to UV irradiation may include a modulation of NPM/B23 gene expression. In this study, attempts were therefore made to elucidate how NPM/B23 is induced by UV irradiation. Our results show that UV-induced NPM/B23 expression is superinduced by cycloheximide, which is characteristic of immediate-early gene response. TT, an UV-damaged dinucleotide mimicking the effects of UV-induced DNA, was able to trigger NPM/B23 expression in the absence of genomic DNA damage. UV-induced activation of NPM/B23 promoter could not be reduced by pretreatment with UV-inducible pathway inhibitors. Our results indicate that UV stimulation of NPM/B23 expression is an immediate-early gene response induced by UV-damaged DNA, and may be a novel UV-inducible pathway. All chemicals and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (mAb) were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Thymine dinucleotide (Midland Certified Reagent, Midland, TX) was dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. NF-κB SN50 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA) was dissolved in PBS. PD98059 and SB203580 were both from Calbiochem-Novabiochem and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Suramin (Biomol, Campus, PA) was dissolved in PBS. Curcumin and wortmannin were both dissolved in ethanol. Anti-NPM/B23 mAb was kindly provided by Dr. Pui Kwong Chan (Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Fluorescein-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was from Cappel (Turnhout, Belgium). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) directed against p53, c-Jun, and phosphorylated form of Tyr-182 p38 and the mAb against NF-κB, the phosphorylated form of Tyr-204 p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Thr-183/Tyr-184 c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated serum (Hyclone, UT) (bovine calf serum for NIH 3T3 cells; fetal bovine serum for HeLa cells), 0.5% antibiotics, and 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Merck) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. For cell immunofluorescence studies, cells were subcultured on glass slides in Petri dishes (Nunc, Denmark) 1 day before use. UV treatments (at 254 nm) were performed with a SpectrolinkerTM XL-1000 (Spectronics, New York, NY). Before UV irradiation, the culture medium was removed, and the original medium was added to cells. Cells were harvested at indicated times. For mock-treated control cells, the same procedure was followed without irradiation. The immunostaining was performed as previously described (26Yung B.Y.M. Busch R.K. Busch H. Mauger A.B. Chan P.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 4059-4063Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown on glass slides and fixed in 2% formaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in PBS (8.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.6 mmNaH2PO4, 0.145 m NaCl, pH 7.2) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized with acetone (Merck) at −20 °C for 3 min. After a wash with PBS three times, the fixed cells were incubated with anti-NPM/B23 mAb (diluted 1:30) at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed 3 times for 15 min each in PBS and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:30 with PBS) at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were washed another three times for 15 min with PBS and mounted in 50% (v/v) glycerol in PBS. The results were examined under a fluorescent light microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Yung B.Y.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 93-100Google Scholar). After normalizing for protein content, extracts were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with antibodies against NPM/B23, β-actin, or p53. For quantification of NPM/B23 in indicated times, NPM/B23 and β-actin immuno-band intensities were determined by densitometric scanning. The values of NPM/B23 were normalized with respect to the intensities of β-actin. Data were analyzed by Image Gauge analysis software (Fujifilm, Japan). Total RNA was prepared from NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells by ULTRA-SPECTM RNA Isolation System (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Aliquots of 8 μg were separated by 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by downward alkaline capillary method and fixed to membrane by drying at 80 °C for 30 min. The NPM/B23 cDNA and β-actin cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using a random primed kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was employed as a probe for detection of NPM/B23 mRNA. Prehybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml denatured (95 °C, 10 min) salmon sperm DNA. Radiolabeled probe at a specific activity of 1 × 108 cpm/ml was hybridized with total RNA in the same solution for 24 h at 42 °C. Washings of the membranes for the probes were performed twice in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and once in 0.3× SSC and 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 10 min. The radioactive NPM/B23 mRNA was determined by autoradiography with PhosphoImager (Fujifilm BAS 1500; Fujifilm). Human genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes. Human NPM/B23 gene containing the promoter region was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using two group-specific primers: the 5′ primer (TAGCGCGCAGCTCTCTTAGGGCGATGTCCTT) and the 3′ primer (TTAAGCTTCGGGTGGCGGCACGCACTTAGGTA) containing a BssHII and aHindIII restriction site at its 5′ end, respectively. The PCR products were digested with BssHII andHindIII (Promega, Madison, WI), and cloned into pCR3CAT. Positive clones containing the 5′ region of the NPM/B23 gene −744 to +97 relative to the initiation of transcription (+1) were screened by restriction enzyme mapping and verified by DNA sequencing. The characteristics of this 5′ region of NPM/B23 gene have been described in previously (27Chan P.K. Chan F.Y. Morris S.W. Xie Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1225-1232Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINETM Reagent (Invitrogen) method. Before transfection, cells (2 × 105 per well) were seeded in 6-well plates overnight. Plasmid DNA (2.5 μg) and LipofectAMINETM Reagent (12.5 μg) were each diluted in serum-free medium (150 μl). DNA and LipofectAMINETMReagent were then mixed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow DNA-liposome complex formation. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, placed in serum-free medium (0.7 ml), and then overlaid with DNA-liposome complexes. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, the DNA-containing medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 10% serum. For stable transfections, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the NPM/B23 promoter-CAT construct designated pCR3-B23CAT as described above. Stably-transfected cells were selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). CAT assay was performed by single-phase extraction. The cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 24 h after transfection. The cellular lysates were heated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous deacetylase activity. Total cellular lysates were diluted to 200 μl with 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.8) and added to 200 μl of reaction buffer containing 125 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm chloramphenicol, 0.2 μCi [3H]acetyl-coenzyme A (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixture was overlaid with 2 ml of a water-immiscible scintillation fluid Ecoscint OTM (National Diagnostic, Atlanta, GA) and then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h to measure NPM/B23 promoter activity. CAT activity was quantified in the scintillation counter (Beckman LSD5000, Palo Alto, CA). For luciferase assay, 10 μl of cell lysate was automatically mixed with the reaction buffer (100 μl of 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4 Mg(OH)2, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 0.53 mm ATP at pH 7.8). Luciferase activity was quantified in a luminomer AutoLunmat LB953 (Berthold, Norwalk, CT). Luciferase activity was normalized to the CAT activity of the same extraction without heat treatment. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. throughout the paper. Statistical analyses were performed with one-way ANOVA test by computer sofware PRISMTM (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All assays were performed at least three times. Fig. 1 shows the immunofluorescence localization of NPM/B23 in NIH 3T3 cells after UV treatment (254 nm, 30 J/m2) at indicated times. Increase of fluorescence occurred after UV irradiation, and NPM/B23 was mainly localized in the nucleolus. The NPM/B23 immunofluorescence in the nucleoplasm was also increased, particularly at 6 and 12 h after UV treatment. This result indicated that NPM/B23 was up-regulated after UV irradiation. It was consistent with our previous immunoblot data that NPM/B23 protein synthesis in UV-treated cells was up-regulated (24Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Yung B.Y.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 93-100Google Scholar, 25Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Chou C.C. Yung B.Y.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 297-305Google Scholar). The time course studies showed that stimulation by UV irradiation of NPM/B23 mRNA expression was also rapid and transient in HeLa/S3 cells (Fig. 2, A andB) and NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). NPM/B23 mRNA peaked 45–60 min after UV treatment and returned to baseline by 12 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Because such kinetics are reminiscent of immediate-early responses (28Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Google Scholar), we also examined whether induction of NPM/B23 by UV exhibits other characteristics of classical immediate-early responses. Immediate-early responses depend on increased transcription rather than mRNA stability and are, therefore, inhibited by transcription blockers, such as actinomycin D (28Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that stimulation of NPM/B23 mRNA expression by UV was inhibited by actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Although these results resembled an immediate-early response, conclusive evidence required examination of protein synthesis inhibitors. Because immediate-early responses are primary effects that do not require synthesis of intermediate proteins, they are not blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis (28Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Google Scholar). Instead, immediate-early responses are superinduced; that is, they are increased in both duration and magnitude (28Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) superinduced the UV stimulation of NPM/B23 mRNA. Taken together, our results demonstrate that stimulation of NPM/B23 by UV might be an immediate-early gene response. To further determine the effect of UV on NPM/B23 gene expression, we tested the responsiveness of the NPM/B23 promoter-reporter construct (pCR3-B23CAT) to UV treatment. NPM/B23 promoter activity was also increased after UV irradiation (30 J/m2) (Fig. 3). There was a 1.5- and 2-fold increases of NPM/B23 promoter activity in Hela/S3 cells and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively, 12 h after UV exposure (Fig. 3). NIH 3T3 fibroblast is often considered as a non-transformed cell line (29Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotton M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Google Scholar), containing normal p53 function, whereas HeLa/S3 is a p53-deficient cancer cell line (30Jia L.Q. Osada M. Ishioka C. Gamo M. Ikawa S. Suzuki T. Shimodaira H. Niitani T. Kudo T. Akiyama M. Kimura N. Matsuo M. Mizusawa H. Tanaka N. Koyama H. Namba M. Kanamaru R. Kuroki T. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 243-253Google Scholar). This result indicated that UV-induction of NPM/B23 did not require the function of the tumor suppressor p53. The small DNA fragment thymine dinucleotides (TT) mimic the effects of UV irradiation and UV-mimetic DNA damage (11Eller M.S. Maeda T. Magnoni C. Atwal D. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12627-12632Google Scholar). TT was thus applied to determine whether UV-damaged DNA had an effect on regulation of NPM/B23. A slowing of cell growth and low percentage (<1%) of dead cells was observed during TT treatment (100 μm, 24 h; data not shown). Western blotting was employed to assay the kinetics of NPM/B23 during TT treatment (100 μm). To compare precisely the levels of NPM/B23 at each indicated time, the immuno-band intensities of NPM/B23 were quantified and normalized with the intensities of β-actin. NPM/B23 protein level was increased by 1.6- and 2-fold at 6 and 12 h respectively in response to TT treatment (Fig. 4). In parallel, p53 was increased during TT treatment as previously reported (11Eller M.S. Maeda T. Magnoni C. Atwal D. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12627-12632Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the immunofluorescence of NPM/B23 was also examined in cells treated with TT (100 μm, 24 h). Similar to UV treatment (Fig. 1), NPM/B23 was also mainly localized in the nucleolus, and the intensity of fluorescence was increased in TT-treated cells (Fig. 5). The activity of the NPM/B23 promoter was also increased after TT treatment (100 μm), and there was an ∼2-fold increase at 12 h after TT treatment (Fig. 6). Taken together, the results indicated that UV-damaged DNA might play an important role in up-regulation of NPM/B23 in cellular response to UV irradiation.Figure 5NPM/B23 immunofluorescence was increased during thymine dinucleotide ( TT ) treatment. NIH 3T3 cells were grown on slides overnight and then treated with 100 μm TT for 3–24 h before the cells were immunostained with anti-NPM/B23 mAb.Left, immunofluorescence stain pictures; right, phase-contrast pictures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Activation of the NPM/B23 promoter by TT treatment. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with NPM/B23 promoter plasmid (pCRB23CAT) and pCR3.1 Luc (as an internal control) in 10-cm dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subcultured onto 6-cm dishes, and then were treated with TT (100 μm). Six hours after TT treatment, cells were harvested and lysed by reporter lysis buffer at indicated times. CAT activity was measured and normalized to the luciferase activity of the same sample. Increase in activation was determined by dividing the CAT activity of each sample by basal CAT activity of mock treatment. *,p < 0.05, as compared with NPM/B23 promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells that were mock-treated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) UVC may mimic growth factor/receptor interactions at the cell surface and activate receptor kinases (8Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Google Scholar). Suramin has been applied to block UV-induced activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (31Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1009-1022Google Scholar, 32Sachsenmaier C. Adriana A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Google Scholar). Suramin blocks receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signals including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) activity (31Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1009-1022Google Scholar, 32Sachsenmaier C. Adriana A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, pretreatment of cells with suramin (5 μm, 30 min) suppressed UV-induced (30 J/m2) phosphorylation of MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38) and protein expression of c-Jun. However, pre-exposure of cells to suramin did not affect UV-induced NPM/B23 mRNA expression (Fig. 7B) and promoter activation (Fig. 7C). UV-induced NPM/B23 expression might thus be independent of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase/MAPK pathway. Several inhibitors of UV-inducible pathway were also applied to elucidate the signals involved in UV-induced NPM/B23 expression. NF-κB SN50 is a cell-permeable peptide and inhibits translocation of the NF-κB active complex into the nucleus (33Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Google Scholar). PD98059 is a selective and cell-permeable inhibitor of MAPK kinase (34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar). SB203580 is a highly specific and cell-permeable inhibitor of p38 MAPK (35Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Börsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Google Scholar). Curcumin is an inhibitor of c-Jun/AP-1 activation (36Huang T.S. Lee S.C. Lin J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5292-5296Google Scholar, 37Hanazawa S. Takeshita A. Amano S. Semba T. Nirazuka T. Katoh H. Kitano S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9526-9532Google Scholar). Wortmannin is a DNA-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (38Park J.S. Park S.J. Peng X. Wang M. Yu M.A. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32520-32527Google Scholar). In this study, pretreatment of the NIH-3T3 cells with NF-κB SN50 (50 μg/ml, 30 min) blocked UV-induced translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (data not shown). UV-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun expression was decreased by pretreatment of cells with PD98059 (5 μm, 30 min) or curcumin (20 μm, 30 min), respectively (Fig. 7A). However, pretreatment (30 min) of NIH 3T3 cells with those inhibitors (NF-κB SN50, 50 μg/ml; PD98059, 5 μm; SB203580, 5 μm; curcumin, 20 μm; wortmannin, 0.5 μm) did not prevent UV-induced NPM/B23 transcription and promoter activation (Fig. 7,B and C). On the other hand, NPM/B23 promoter activity was elevated (∼1.4-fold) in the cells treated with wortmannin (0.5 μm, 6 h; no UV treatment) alone (Fig. 7C). DNA-dependent kinase or wortmannin-target component might, by itself, participate in the regulation of NPM/B23 in cells without UV treatment. Our results have shown that NPM/B23 is immediate-early inducible by UV irradiation. Immediate-early responses are primary effects that do not require synthesis of intermediate proteins, and they are not blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis (28Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Google Scholar, 39Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Google Scholar) Immediate-early genes encompass a variety of different protein families, including Fos, Jun, and Myc (40Winkles J.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 41-78Google Scholar). Currently, there are ∼100 members in the immediate-early gene set (39Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Google Scholar). The immediate-early genes can be subdivided into 2 classes: fast and slow immediate-early genes, distinguishable by their activation kinetics (41Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Google Scholar). The prototype immediate-early gene, c-fos, is a member of the fast immediate-early genes. Growth factor added to quiescent 3T3 cells stimulates transcription of c-Fos within 10 min. c-Fos expression peaks within 30 min and returns to baseline levels within 2 h (42Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-437Google Scholar, 43Kelly K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4828-4831Google Scholar). Serum response element, cAMP response element, and sis-inducible element are required for transcription of many fast-kinetic immediate-early genes (41Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Hwang G.Y. Wrentmore A.L. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17417-17424Google Scholar). On the other hand, the slow immediate-early genes display a slower induction profile after stimulation. Transcription of slow immediate-early genes has a greater lag and persists longer than the rapidly repressed fast-kinetics genes. These genes lack the consensus serum response element and other particular set of transcription control elements (44Latinkic B.V. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23163-23170Google Scholar). Slow-kinetics immediate-early gene like c-myc displays a 60 min lag period before initiation of transcription in response to growth-factor stimulation (45Dean M. Levine R.A. Ran W. Kindy W.S. Sonenshein G.E. Campis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9161-9166Google Scholar). NPM/B23 promoter region lacks the consensus sequence of serum response element, cAMP response element, or sis-inducible element (data not shown). In addition, the UV-induced expression of NPM/B23 gene also displays a greater lag time (45–60 min) before initiation of transcription and persists longer (12 h) than fast-kinetic genes. Up-regulation of NPM/B23 could thus be a slow-kinetic immediate-early gene response to UV irradiation. Activation of immediate-early genes is thought to be an important initial step in the regulation of cellular and genomic responses to external stimulation (28Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Google Scholar). Our results implicate that NPM/B23 plays an important role in cellular response to UV. Our results have also shown that UV-induced activation of NPM/B23 may be mediated through a novel route, rather than receptor tyrosine kinase/MAPK pathway. Treatment of cells with TT causes up-regulation of NPM/B23 and p53, in the absence of initial genomic DNA damage. DNA damage can elicit multiple responses in mammalian cells, including the activation of numerous cascades of signal transduction that result in the activation of cellular genes involved in growth control, DNA repair, and apoptosis (8Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Google Scholar, 46Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicate that overexpression of NPM/B23 makes cells more resistant to UV-induced cell growth inhibition and cell death, and this effect may be associated with enhancement of DNA repair activity (24Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Yung B.Y.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 93-100Google Scholar, 25Wu M.H. Chang J.H. Chou C.C. Yung B.Y.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 297-305Google Scholar). NPM/B23 has been identified and characterized as genotoxic stress-induced (UV or ionizing radiation) protein (47Yang C. Maiguel D.A. Carrier F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2251-2260Google Scholar). UV-damaged DNA may be an important factor for induction of NPM/B23 expression. UVC is strongly absorbed by DNA, and DNA itself may be an important sensor to trigger signals that induce DNA repair. This pathway is well characterized by the SOS response in prokaryotes (2Walker G.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 425-457Google Scholar), but there is no definite response in eukaryotes yet (8Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Google Scholar, 11Eller M.S. Maeda T. Magnoni C. Atwal D. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12627-12632Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 is a well known molecule that arrests DNA replication and induces DNA repair in response to DNA damage (48Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Google Scholar). Our results have shown that expression of NPM/B23 is also induced by UV in p53-deficient cells (HeLa/S3 cells). NPM/B23 and some DNA repair-associated proteins (49Hsing A. Faller D.V. Vazir C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26024-26031Google Scholar, 50Zhao H. Jin S. Fan F. Fan W. Tong T. Zhan Q. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6276-6280Google Scholar, 51Wang S.C. Makino K. Su L.K. Pao A.Y. Kim J.S. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2838-2842Google Scholar) may be regulated in a p53-independent pathway. In conclusion, the immediate-early induction of NPM/B23 indicates the existence of a new regulatory pathway that might enable cells to react rapidly upon induction of DNA damage. This is important evidence for a possible involvement of NPM/B23 in an acute response of mammalian cells to environmental stress.

https://openalex.org/W1999095939,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signals through a heteromeric complex of serine/threonine kinase receptors. The type I receptor phosphorylates and activates the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3, which form hetero-oligomeric complexes with the co-Smad, Smad4, and translocate to the nucleus. Smad3 and Smad4 can bind directly to consensus DNA-binding elements in the promoters of target genes, whereas Smad2/Smad4 complexes are targeted to DNA by interacting with sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors that contain a well-defined Smad interaction motif (SIM). The exact stoichiometry of Smad homo- and hetero-oligomers both before and after ligand stimulation is controversial. Here we determine the stoichiometry of TGF-β-induced Smad-transcription factor complexes on DNA. We show that complexes of Smad2/Smad4 with the transcription factors Fast-1 or Fast-3 contain one Fast, two Smad2s, and one Smad4. In contrast, Smad3/Smad4 complexes that bind the Smad-binding element from the c-jun promoter, are heterodimers. Furthermore, these Smad3/Smad4 complexes contain at least two additional components essential for complex formation, one of which contains a SIM. Our data suggest that the R-Smads can form heterodimers or heterotrimers with Smad4, and we propose that the exact stoichiometries of active Smad complexes on DNA may be determined by the transcription factors with which they associate.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3987) Google Scholar). TGF-β can elicit a diverse array of biological effects and has been shown to regulate cell growth, apoptosis, migration, differentiation, and specification of cell fate (2Massagué J. Blain S.W.

Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The mechanism of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus for these ligands has been intensively studied. Ligand binding results in the formation and activation of a heterotetrameric complex of two type II and two type I receptor serine/threonine kinases (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3987) Google Scholar). The type I receptor then phosphorylates and activates receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), which are Smad2 and Smad3 in the case of the TGF-β receptors (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3987) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation occurs on the two C-terminal serines in the SSXS motif at the extreme C termini of Smads 2 and 3. Following activation, the R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with the co-Smad, Smad4, via their C-terminal (so-called MH2) domains and translocate to the nucleus where they are directly involved in transcriptional regulation of target genes (2Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar, 3Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). During active signaling, the R-Smads are continually dephosphorylated in the nucleus, resulting in the dissociation of the heteromeric complexes and the return of the Smads to the cytoplasm (4Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). If the receptors are still active, the R-Smads are re-phosphorylated, form complexes with Smad4, and translocate back to the nucleus. If the receptors are no longer active, the Smads are retained in the cytoplasm (4Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 5Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). TGF-β signal transduction results in the initiation of a new program of gene expression. It is therefore essential to determine how the Smads are regulated and how they in turn regulate transcription. Fundamental to the understanding of these processes is a detailed characterization both of the TGF-β-induced Smad heteromeric complexes, and of the complexes that assemble at promoter elements with sequence-specific transcription factors. An important issue is that of the stoichiometry of these complexes. Study of the stoichiometry of Smad complexes to date has focused solely on the Smads and remains controversial (6Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1867-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses using purified full-length or C-terminal fragments of Smad2, or Smad2 from cell extracts, have demonstrated that in the unstimulated state Smad2 is monomeric (7Kawabata M.

Similar analyses with Smad3 indicate that endogenous Smad3 exists in multiple oligomeric states in unstimulated cells (8Jayaraman L. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40710-40717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), while purified C-terminal fragments of Smad3 can be either monomeric or trimeric (11Chacko B.M. Qin B.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the uninduced state, Smad4 can exist as monomers (7Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), dimers, or trimers (8Jayaraman L. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40710-40717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and crystallographic studies have shown that purified C-terminal fragments of Smad4 are trimers (13Shi Y.

Des. 1999; 7: 1493-1503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following ligand stimulation, Smad2 has been described to form homotrimers (7Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), but with Smad4 it appears to form heterodimers, heterotrimers, and also higher order complexes (7Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A.

Studies of purified phosphorylated full-length and C-terminal fragments of Smad2 have demonstrated that activated Smad2 preferentially forms homotrimers (9Wu J.W., Hu, M. Chai J. Seoane J.

Similarly, purified pseudo-phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of Smad3 (11Chacko B.M. Qin B. Correia J.J. Lam S.S. de Caestecker M.P. Lin K. Nat. Struct.

Activated Smad3/Smad4 complexes have not yet been fully analyzed in vivo. It is not clear whether these different results are a consequence of the methods used to determine the stoichiometry or whether Smads really can exist in several different types of complexes. Smad3 and Smad4 can bind directly to the Smad-binding DNA element (SBE), which contains only four base pairs (5′-GTCT-3′ or its reverse complement, 5′-AGAC-3′), via their N-terminal (so-called MH1) domains (16Zawel L.

These interactions are weak and insufficient to convey promoter selectivity (17Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P.

For example, in earlyXenopus embryos, complexes of Smad2 with Smad4β (a novelXenopus Smad4 homologue) (22Howell M. Itoh F. Pierreux C.E. Valgeirsdottir S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Dev.

Development. 2002; 129: 2823-2834PubMed Google Scholar) and to the distal element (DE) of the goosecoid promoter by the paired-like homeodomain transcription factors Mixer, Milk, and Bix.3 (27Germain S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Smad2-transcription factor interaction is mediated by a defined proline-rich Smad interaction motif (SIM) present in the transcription factor (27Germain S. Howell M. Esslemont G.M. Hill C.S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 435-451PubMed Google Scholar, 28Randall R.A. Germain S. Inman G.J. Bates P.A. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the MH2 domain of Smad2 (28Randall R.A. Germain S. Inman G.J. Bates P.A. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Due to the controversy surrounding the stoichiometry of Smad complexes we sought to determine the stoichiometry of active Smad-transcription factor complexes on DNA. We demonstrate that Fast-1/Smad2/Smad4 (ARF1) and Fast-3/Smad2/Smad4 (ARF2) complexes contain one Fast, two Smad2s, and one Smad4. In contrast, we show that Smad3/Smad4 complexes interacting with the c-jun Smad binding region (29Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T., Li, J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which we refer to as the SBR, are heterodimers. Further analysis reveals that these Smad3/Smad4 complexes also contain an essential SIM-containing subunit and a further stabilizing protein that interacts with a repeated CCAG motif in the 3′-region of this element. Our data suggest that R-Smads may form heterodimers or heterotrimers with Smad4, and we propose that the exact stoichiometries of active Smad complexes on DNA may be determined by the transcription factors with which they associate. The following plasmids have been described previously: XSmad2 and hSmad4 in FLAG-, HA-, and Myc-containing EF expression vectors (5Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell.

Myc- and FLAG-tagged hSmad3 in EF expression vectors were subcloned from pcDNA3-hSmad3 (a gift from Peter ten Dijke). NIH3T3, HaCaT, and Smad2-null mouse embryo fibroblasts were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). TGF-β1 (Peprotech) was dissolved in 4 mm HCl containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and used at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml.

Approximately 30,000 cpm were used for each reaction. The wild-type SIM peptide and SIM mutant peptide, containing an N-terminal biotin group, were as described (27Germain S. Howell M. Esslemont G.M. Hill C.S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 435-451PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide pull-downs were as previously described (28Randall R.A. Germain S. Inman G.J. Bates P.A. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and Western blots were performed with antibodies against Smad3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and Smad4 (B8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Previous attempts to define the stoichiometry of Smad homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes have relied on in vitro purified full-length and C-terminal fragments of Smad molecules and biochemical fractionation of whole cell extracts. These studies have been complemented with crystallographic studies of fragments of individual Smads and subsequent molecular modeling (6Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1867-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The findings of these studies are controversial as discussed above (6Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1867-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The primary result of TGF-β signal transduction is the modulation of gene expression mediated by Smad-transcription factor complexes. We therefore sought to determine the stoichiometries of previously identified Smad-transcription factor-DNA and Smad-DNA complexes, and chose a simple approach to define them (Fig. 1). Cells were transfected with known components of, for example, the ARF1 complex (24Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 25Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) containing different N-terminal epitope tags. Cells were then induced with TGF-β and nuclear extracts prepared. These extracts were employed in bandshift analyses using an appropriate probe (for example, theXenopus Mix.2 promoter ARE; Fig. 1). Supershift analysis with different combinations of the epitope tag antibodies allows direct determination of the number of each of the known subunits in the complex (Fig. 1). Using the approach outlined in Fig. 1 we determined the stoichiometry of the ARF1 complex. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with T7 epitope-tagged Fast-1, untagged Smad4, and FLAG-, and Myc-tagged Smad2. Treatment with TGF-β for 1 h resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of ARF1 detected by bandshift analysis (Fig. 2 A). This complex was entirely supershifted by the T7 and Smad4 antibodies indicating that it contains both Fast-1 and Smad4. Supershifting with either the FLAG or Myc antibodies resulted in a partial supershift of the complex indicating incorporation of both the FLAG- and Myc-tagged Smad2s in the complex. Inclusion of both antibodies in the bandshift reaction resulted in a stronger supershift and the appearance of a super-supershifted band (Fig. 2 A). This result indicates that the ARF1 complex contains at least two Smad2s. The residual non-supershifted complex (Fig. 2 A) is due to the presence of endogenous Smad2, as the whole complex is supershifted with the Smad2/3 antibody (data not shown and Fig. 2 C). In order to determine if this complex contains more than two Smad2s we performed analogous experiments with FLAG-, Myc-, and HA-tagged Smad2. Inclusion of each pair of antibodies in the bandshift reaction resulted in a super-supershifted complex with identical mobility (data not shown). Inclusion of all three antibodies in the bandshift reaction resulted in the appearance of a super-supershifted complex, but not a triply-supershifted complex (Fig. 2 B), even after prolonged exposure of the film (data not shown). Note that it is possible to detect triply supershifted complexes, for instance upon inclusion in the bandshift reaction of two antibodies that recognize the tags on Smad2 together with an antibody that recognizes Smad4 (see right lane, Fig. 2 A). Thus from these experiments we conclude that ARF1 contains two Smad2s. The same experiment was performed with FLAG- and Myc-tagged Smad4 and untagged Smad2 (Fig. 2 C). Equivalent supershifts were readily detected with the FLAG and Myc antibodies, and inclusion of both antibodies increased the intensity of the single supershift, but did not result in the detection of a super-supershifted complex (Fig. 2 C). Thus ARF1 contains one Smad4. Finally we determined the number of Fast-1 molecules present in the ARF1 complex employing the same methodology, and using FLAG- and HA-tagged Fast-1 with endogeneous Smads. Inclusion of the Flag or HA antibodies in the bandshift reactions resulted in a partial supershift of the ARF1 complex, whereas inclusion of both antibodies resulted in a complete supershift, but did not reveal a super-supershifted complex. Thus ARF1 contains one Fast-1 (Fig. 2 D) (33Yeo C.Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a second complex (ARF2), which forms on the Mix.2 ARE in Xenopus embryos in response to endogenous TGF-β family members (22Howell M. Itoh F. Pierreux C.E. Valgeirsdottir S. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and have identified its transcription factor component as Fast-3 (26Howell M. Inman G.J. Hill C.S. Development. 2002; 129: 2823-2834PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore performed an identical analysis to that described above to determine the stoichiometry of ARF2. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with T7-tagged Fast-3, untagged Smad4, and FLAG-, Myc-, and HA-tagged Smad2, and ARF2 was analyzed by bandshift assay. Supershifting with the anti-FLAG, -Myc, or -HA antibodies resulted in a partial supershift of the complex (Fig. 3 A). Inclusion of each pair of antibodies in the bandshift reaction resulted in a super-supershifted complex (data not shown). Inclusion of all three antibodies in the bandshift reaction resulted in the appearance of a super-supershifted complex, but not the appearance of a triply supershifted complex, indicating that ARF2 contains two Smad2s (F"
https://openalex.org/W2017968555,"Protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1), together with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is a major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase involved in regulation of numerous cell functions. Although the roles of PP2A have been studied extensively using okadaic acid, a well known inhibitor of PP2A, biological analysis of PP1 has remained restricted because of lack of a specific inhibitor. Recently we reported that tautomycetin (TC) is a highly specific inhibitor of PP1. To elucidate the biological effects of TC, we demonstrated in preliminary experiments that treatment of COS-7 cells with 5 μm TC for 5 h inhibits endogenous PP1 by more than 90% without affecting PP2A activity. Therefore, using TC as a specific PP1 inhibitor, the biological effect of PP1 on MAPK signaling was examined. First, we found that inhibition of PP1 in COS-7 cells by TC specifically suppresses activation of ERK, among three MAPK kinases (ERK, JNK, and p38). TC-mediated inhibition of PP1 also suppressed activation of Raf-1, resulting in the inactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway. To examine the role of PP1 in regulation of Raf-1, we overexpressed the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1C) in COS-7 cells and found that PP1C enhanced activation of Raf-1 activity, whereas phosphatase-dead PP1C blocked Raf-1 activation. Furthermore, a physical interaction between PP1C and Raf-1 was also observed. These data strongly suggest that PP1 positively regulates Raf-1 in vivo. Protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1), together with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is a major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase involved in regulation of numerous cell functions. Although the roles of PP2A have been studied extensively using okadaic acid, a well known inhibitor of PP2A, biological analysis of PP1 has remained restricted because of lack of a specific inhibitor. Recently we reported that tautomycetin (TC) is a highly specific inhibitor of PP1. To elucidate the biological effects of TC, we demonstrated in preliminary experiments that treatment of COS-7 cells with 5 μm TC for 5 h inhibits endogenous PP1 by more than 90% without affecting PP2A activity.

Protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A, known as PP11 and PP2A, are two of four major protein serine/threonine phosphatases (PPs) that regulate diverse cellular events such as cell division, transcription, translation, muscle contraction, glycogen synthesis, and neuronal signaling (3DePaoli-Roach A.A.

Okadaic acid (OA), a polyether fatty acid from the marine black spongeHalichondria okadai, was first identified as a small molecular weight inhibitor of PP and has been studied extensively (6Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). More than 40 compounds that inhibit PP1 as well as PP2A have been identified. Using these natural compounds, numerous experiments have been performed to analyze the roles of PPs in various cellular events (6Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The IC50 values of such phosphatase inhibitors are almost identical for PP1 and PP2A, with the exception of compounds such as OA, TF-23A, and fostriecin (8Gupta V. Ogawa A.K., Du, X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Matsuzawa S. Kawamura T. Mitsuhashi S. Suzuki T. Matsuo Y. Suzuki M. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Bioorg. Med.

PP2A is selectively inhibited by OA, TF-23A, and fostriecin, and this selectivity has made it possible to analyze PP2A function in living cells. However, no known inhibitor inhibits PP1 specifically. Oikawa et al. (11Oikawa M. Ueno T. Oikawa H. Ichihara A. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 5048-5068Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported the total chemical synthesis of tautomycin (TM), a small molecular weight PP inhibitor originally isolated from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus. Using the synthesized TM and related compounds, we previously examined the structure-function relationship of TM and found that the left- and right-hand moieties of TM are required for inhibition of PP and induction of apoptosis, respectively (12Kawamura T. Matsuzawa S. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Oikawa H. Oikawa M. Ubukata M. Ichihara A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We also reported that the spiroketal structure in the right-hand moiety of tautomycin has nothing to do with phosphatase inhibition but rather induces apoptosis (13Mitsuhashi S. Shima H. Kawamura T. Kikuchi K. Oikawa M. Ichihara A. Oikawa H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that tautomycetin (TC), an antifungal antibiotic originally isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes (14Cheng X.-C. Kihara T. Ying X. Uramoto M. Osada H. Kusakabe H. Wang B.-N. Kobayashi Y., Ko, K. Yamaguchi I. Shen Y.-C. Isono K. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 42: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), could be a potent PP1-specific inhibitor that would likely exhibit few nonspecific effects because it is structurally similar to TM but lacks a spiroketal structure (15Cheng X.-C. Ubukata M. Isono K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo ). 1990; 43: 890-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that TC is a specific PP1 inhibitor in vitro and proposed that TC may be used as a novel powerful probe to elucidate the physiological roles of PP1 in various biological events (16Mitsuhashi S. Matsuura N. Ubukata M. Oikawa H. Shima H. Kikuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PP1 is composed of the catalytic subunit (PP1C) and a wide variety of targeting/regulatory subunits (4Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 5Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Thus far four PP1C isoforms, α, γ1, γ2 and δ, have been identified that are widely expressed in mammalian tissues (17Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Sasaki K. Shima H. Kitagawa Y. Irino S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Jpn. J.

Biochemical analysis using bacterially expressed PP1C isoforms of all four types has shown that they have similar properties (22Shirato H. Shima H. Sakashita G. Nakano T. Ito M. Lee E.-Y. Kikuchi K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13848-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PP1C may be regulated by its interaction with a variety of subunits that appear to target PP1C to specific subcellular locations and define substrate specificity. For three decades, we have extensively investigated neoplastic alterations in hepatomas of enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism and containing protein phosphatases. We first found that PP1 activity was markedly elevated in rat ascites hepatomas (23Kikuchi K. Shineha R. Hiraga A. Tamura S. Kikuchi H. Tsuiki S. Gann. 1984; 75: 388-394PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shineha R. Kikuchi K. Tamura S. Hiraga A. Suzuki Y. Tsuiki S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Then we observed that levels of both PP1α mRNA and PP1α protein were irreversibly increased in hepatomas and that PP1α protein accumulated in the non-nuclear membrane fraction and the nuclei (19Kitamura K. Mizuno Y. Sasaki A. Yasui A. Tsuiki S. Kikuchi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 307-310PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kitamura K. Mizuno Y. Hatayama I. Sato K. Tamura S. Nagao M. Tsuiki S. Kikuchi K.

The increase in PP1α mRNA expression seen in rat ascite hepatoma cells was due to the enhanced promoter activity of the PP1α gene (28Nomoto K. Shibata N. Kitamura K. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,29Nomoto K. Shibata N. Imai Y. Kitamura K. Nakamura K. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 331-334PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to increases in PP1 expression seen in rat ascite hepatoma cells, PP2A and PP2C expression was not increased but rather was down-regulated (26Saadat M. Kitamura K. Mizuno Y. Saeki H. Kudo T. Kikuchi K. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1994; 18: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested a positive involvement of PP1 in regulating cell growth of tumor cells. However, the mechanism underlying this role of PP1 remained unknown. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades plays a key role in transducing various extracellular signals to the nucleus (30Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 31Garrington T., P. Johnson G., L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 32Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Three distinct MAPK cascades have been described: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun NH2 kinases (JNK), and homologues of the budding yeast HOG1 protein (p38). Activation of MAPKs requires phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues by dual-specificity MAPK kinases, which in turn are activated by the phosphorylation of two serine residues by upstream MAPK kinase kinases. The ERK pathway (Raf-MEK1,2-ERK1,2) is activated by mitogen via Ras and by phorbol esters via protein kinase C. The stress-activated MAPK pathways JNK (MEK kinase 1,3-SEK1,2-JNK1,2,3) and p38 (ASK1, TAK1-MKK3,6-p38α,β,γ,δ) are activated by cellular stress,e.g. UV light, osmotic and oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines (30Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 31Garrington T., P. Johnson G., L. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation of MAPKs results in their translocation to the nucleus, where they activate transcription factors by phosphorylation. Activities of MAPKs, MAPK kinases, and MAPK kinase kinases are also regulated by dephosphorylation at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues by serine/threonine, tyrosine, and dual-specificity phosphatases, respectively (32Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 33Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Numerous observations suggest that PP2A plays a major role in the down-regulation of JNK, MEK, and ERK activities. Therefore, the inhibition of intracellular PP2A by OA leads to the activation of these enzymes (6Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35Shanley T.P. Vasi N. Denenberg A. Wong H.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of PP1 in MAPK pathways has not been studied because of the lack of a PP1-specific inhibitor. In the present study, we found that treatment of COS-7 cells with 5 μm TC selectively inhibited PP1 activity by more than 90% without affecting PP2A activity, demonstrating that TC is a useful tool for analysis of the biological function of PP1. Using TC, we then examined the involvement of PP1 in regulating MAPKs. These results are summarized as follows: (i) TC specifically inhibits activation of ERK among three MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) upon treatment of cells with TPA and EGF; (ii) TC treatment suppresses activation of Raf-1 activity, which results in inactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway; (iii) overexpression of phosphatase-dead mutants of PP1C on the Raf-1-MEK pathway results in effects similar to those found in TC treatment of cells; (iv) PP1C physically interacts with Raf-1. These results are the first demonstration that PP1 is a positive regulator of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. TC was prepared from S. griseochromogenes as described previously (14Cheng X.-C. Kihara T.

COS-7 and 293-T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) or RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.9 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 units/ml penicillin G (termed “complete medium”) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. 8–9 × 105 cells were cultured in 1 ml of complete medium in 35-mm dishes. Five μl of Me2SO or Me2SO plus OA or/and TC was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5.5 h. Adherent cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (divalent, cation-free) on ice and scraped in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at 4 °C. Suspensions were subjected to three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing at 30 °C and were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 15,000 rpm. The resulting supernatants were used as enzymes. Phosphorylase was 32P-labeled by phosphorylase kinase to 1 mol of phosphate/mol of phosphorylase and used at 5 μm in the assay (16Mitsuhashi S.

Briefly, 10 μl of cell-free extracts were diluted with solution A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The diluted enzymes were then preincubated with 30 μl of solution A containing 0.33 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35 with or without the inhibitor for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated with 32P-labeled substrate in 20 μl of solution A containing 15 mm caffeine. After 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 10 mmH2SO4 acid solution containing 20 mm silicotungstic acid, and the solution was centrifuged. Subsequent procedures were essentially the same as those described previously (16Mitsuhashi S. Matsuura N. Ubukata M. Oikawa H. Shima H. Kikuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the release of 1 μmol of phosphate/min. The activity of calcineurin was measured as described previously (42Mitsuhashi S. Shima H. Kikuchi K. Igarashi K. Hatsuse R. Maeda K. Yazawa M. Murayama T. Okuma Y. Nomura Y. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). COS-7 and 293-T cells in 35-mm dishes were co-transfected with 1 μg of pEBG-MEK1, pEBG-SEK1, or pEBG-MKK6 together with 1 μg of pSRα-HA-ERK2, pSRα-HA-JNK1, or pMT3-HA-p38α, respectively. For transient assays, cells were transfected using Fugene-6 (Roche Diagnostics Inc., Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Forty hours after transfection, cells were maintained with or without phosphatase inhibitors for 4.5–5.5 h and then stimulated with either 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (TPA) or EGF for ERK2 activation. For JNK1 and p38α activation, cells were stimulated with 0.4 m sorbitol for 30 min. Transfected cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline on ice and lysed by sonication in MAPK lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmorthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min. Each sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphorylation status of activated MAPKs, MEK1, and SEK1 was monitored by anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (New England Biolabs (NEB)), anti-ACTIVE JNK antibody (Promega), an anti-phospho p38 antibody (NEB), an anti-phospho MEK1/2 antibody (NEB), or an anti-phospho SEK1/MKK4 antibody (NEB) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). The expression levels of HA-tagged MAPKs and GST-tagged MAPK kinases were monitored by anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal (Roche Diagnostics) anti-GST monoclonal antibodies (CG1B), respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Transfected or treated cells on 35-mm dishes were lysed by sonication in MAPK lysis buffer. After centrifugation of cell lysates at 20,000 × gfor 10 min, the resulting supernatant was used as a cellular extract. FLAG epitope-tagged Raf-1 in extracts was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Raf kinase activity was determined by incubating immunoprecipitates in the presence of GST-MEK (0.1 μg) and GST-KNERK (1.5 μg) in 40 μl of kinase reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.4 mm benzamidine, 5% glycerol, and 100 μm ATP) for 8–25 min at 30–35 °C. After incubation, proteins in the reaction mixture were separated by SDS-PAGE. Phospho-ERK and Raf-1 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphoERK antibody, anti-Raf-1 antibody C12, or anti-Raf-1 antibody E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The amounts of phospho-ERK and Raf-1 were quantified using a luminescent image analyzer, LAS-1000 Plus (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Transfected cells were lysed in 300 μl/100-mm plate co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 °C, 4 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm orthovanadate, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 10 min. 150 μl of supernatant was incubated with anti-Raf-1 antibody (1.6 μg) or anti-Myc antibody (14 μg). After rotation for 30 min at 4 °C, 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (AmershamBiosciences) was added to the mixture. After rotation for 1.5 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed with 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 25 μl of 1.25× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE on 9% gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (AmershamBiosciences). Raf-1 or Myc-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the respective antibodies. The protein concentration was measured by a modification of the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (43Friedenauer S. Berlet H., H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were diluted with 0.01% Triton X-100. 50 μl of diluted lysate was added to 0.95 ml of a mixture of 0.2 ml of dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and 0.75 ml of 0.01% Triton X-100. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the sample was read against appropriate solvent dye blanks at 595 nm. We recently demonstrated that tautomycetin is the most specific PP1 inhibitor among more than 40 phosphatase inhibitors assayed in vitro; however, its biological effect remained to be examined (16Mitsuhashi S. Matsuura N. Ubukata M. Oikawa H. Shima H. Kikuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To do so, we first measured the activity levels of PP1 and PP2A in extracts prepared from COS-7 cells pretreated with TC or okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A (Fig. 1). From preliminary experiments of dose responsivity, the concentrations required for complete inhibition of PP1 and PP2A in COS-7 cells were 5 μm TC and 100 nm OA, respectively (data not shown). To differentiate between residual phosphatase activity in cell extracts, phosphatase activity levels were measured using phosphorylase a as a substrate in the presence or absence of 1 nm OA to specifically inhibit PP2A or 167 nm I-2 to specifically inhibit PP1. Total phosphatase activities in extracts of OA-treated cells were resistant to 1 nm OA, and ∼90% of the phosphatase activity was inhibited by 167 nm I-2, showing that OA treatment specifically inhibits intracellular PP2A. Residual phosphatase activity in extracts from TC-treated cells was resistant to 167 nm I-2 and completely inhibited by 1 nm OA. These results strongly suggest that TC penetrates cell membranes and binds to and specifically inhibits PP1, and the binding between TC and PP1C is tight enough to resist dissociation during preparation of cell extracts. We then examined the effects of TC on other phosphatases. TC had no effect on purified calcineurin and LDP-1 up to 1 μm. The IC50 for PP5 is ∼1 μm higher than for PP2A (data not shown). From these results, we concluded that TC could be used as a tool to investigate the biological function of PP1. It is known that PP2A inhibits the activation of ERK and JNK, based on observations that treatment of cells with OA results in hyperphosphorylation/activation of ERK and JNK (6Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 35Shanley T.P. Vasi N. Denenberg A. Wong H.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because we were interested in the role of PP1 in the regulation of MAPK activation, we compared the effects of OA and TC on activation of HA-ERK2, HA-JNK1, or HA-p38α expressed in COS-7 and 293T cells (Fig. 2). As expected, OA at 100 nmincreased the phosphorylation levels of HA-ERK2 in unstimulated COS-7 and 293T cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and9). However, in contrast, TC at 5 μmdramatically decreased the phosphorylation levels of HA-ERK2 activated by TPA in COS-7 and 293T cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6and 12). On the other hand, TC and OA showed similar positive effects on JNK activation (Fig. 2 B), but neither TC nor OA showed any effect on p38 activation (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that inhibition of PP1 by pretreatment of cells with TC specifically blocks ERK activation. ERK is phosphorylated directly by MEK. To clarify whether inhibition of ERK activation is due to suppression of MEK activation, we compared the effect of TC on GST-MEK activation with that on HA-ERK upon stimulation at various concentrations of TPA in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, TC decreased phosphorylation/activation of GST-MEK substantially. The rates of decrease in phospho-GST-MEK by TC treatment were similar to those seen with phospho-GST-MEK (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 14 and 15 with lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that inhibition of ERK activation results from inhibition of MEK activation. Under these conditions, OA enhanced phosphorylation of MEK as well as ERK (6Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J.

After induction of IRF7 by autocrine interferon, latent IRF7 is activated by virus-induced phosphorylation on serine residues within the C-terminal regulatory domain. Although it is likely that IRF7 is subjected to a cascade of events responsible for regulating its biological activity, to date no mechanism other than phosphorylation has been reported to modulate IRF7 activity. Here, we report that IRF7 is acetylated in vivo by the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and GCN5. The single lysine residue target for acetylation, lysine 92, is located in the DNA-binding domain and is conserved throughout the entire IRF family. Mutation of lysine 92 resulted in complete abolition of DNA binding ability. However, a mutant that cannot be acetylated by PCAF due to a change in the surrounding amino acid context of lysine 92 showed increased DNA binding and activity compared with wild type IRF7. Conversely, we showed that acetylated IRF7 displayed impaired DNA binding capability and that over-expression of PCAF led to decreased IRF7 activity. Together, our results strongly suggest that acetylation of lysine 92 negatively modulates IRF7 DNA binding.

Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Ten members of the family have been identified so far: IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, IRF4/Pip/ISCAT, IRF5, IRF6, IRF7, IRF8/ICSBP, IRF9/p48, and the recently cloned avian IRF10. In addition there are at least four more distantly related viral homologues encoded by human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) (2Nehyba J. Hrdlickova R. Burnside J. Bose Jr., H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3942-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This family is mainly defined by a highly conserved amino-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) characterized by a repeat containing five tryptophan residues that shows similarities with the c-myb proto-oncogene DBD (4Veals S.A.

Two closely related members of this family, IRF3 and IRF7, have been identified as direct transducers of virus-mediated signaling and were shown to play an essential role in the induction of type I interferon (IFN) (5Marie I.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar) have clearly established that IRF3 and IRF7 activity is regulated by virally induced phosphorylation of serine residues located in their C terminus. Phosphorylation induces allosteric changes that result in dimerization and facilitate nuclear retention, derepress transactivation, and allow specific DNA binding (9Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 10Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8803-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Despite the important similarities among IRF family proteins, each provides a unique biological function. For instance, although both IRF3 and IRF7 are involved in IFN gene expression during viral infections, IRF3 targets specifically IFNβ and α4 (5Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, IRF7 is required for the induction of additional members of the IFNα multi-gene family (5Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Although there are several structural differences between IRF3 and IRF7 that could account for this difference, the major determinant appears to be DNA binding specificity. IRF3 binds with high affinity to relatively perfect GAA repeat motifs found within the positive regulatory domain I of the IFNβ promoter and the IFNα4 promoter; in contrast, IRF7 displays a more relaxed DNA binding specificity allowing it to bind variant sequences found in promoters of the other IFNα genes (13Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, the structural basis for differential DNA binding has not been elucidated. Posttranslational modifications in addition to phosphorylation have been found to modulate transcription factor activity, including effects on DNA binding affinity. Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) are increasingly being recognized as modifiers of non-histone proteins, and there is a growing body of evidence supporting the notion that acetylation, like phosphorylation, is an important regulatory protein modification (for review, see Ref. 14Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). There are now several reported families of acetylases exemplified by PCAF/GCN5, p300/CBP, TAF250, SRC1, and MOZ (for review, see Ref. 15Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Of these proteins, two families, PCAF/GCN5 and p300/CBP, are the most characterized and potent acetylases compared with other families. HATs function enzymatically by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A (acetylCoA) to the ε amino group of certain lysine side chains. Transcription factors that have been shown to be acetylated by different HAT proteins include p53, MyoD, HNF4, E2F1, and c-Myb. These acetylation events have been shown to directly affect protein function. The consequence of acetylation on protein function is highly variable from one protein to another and depends on where within the protein the acetylation takes place. For p53 and E2F1, for example, acetylation regulates DNA binding (16Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar, 17Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Besides affecting DNA binding, acetylation has also been reported to modulate protein-protein interactions. For example, the association of nuclear receptors with their co-activator ACTR is inhibited by acetylation (18Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Protein stability is the third characteristic to be altered by acetylation. Increased stability has been correlated with acetylated E2F1 and α-tubulin (17Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 19Takemura R. Okabe S. Umeyama T. Kanai Y. Cowan N.J. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 953-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the potential of lysine acetylation to modulate DNA binding, we investigated the possible acetylation of IRF7. Here we show that IRF7 is subject to acetylation by the HAT of the PCAF/GCN5 familyin vivo. We mapped the acetylation site to a unique lysine residue in the DBD at position 92. Using different point mutants, we provide evidence that this residue is within a region that distinguishes IRF3 and IRF7 DNA binding affinity and is essential for DNA binding. Finally we show that acetylation leads to impaired DNA binding of IRF7 to its cognate DNA. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and monkey kidney COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA transfections of 293T and COS cells were performed by standard methods using calcium phosphate. Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Manhattan strain, was grown in 10-day embryonated chicken eggs, and viral infections were performed as previously described (5Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit and mouse antibodies to FLAG were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to acetylated lysines were obtained from Cell Signaling, and rabbit antibodies to IRF7 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. EMSAs were performed by incubating nuclear extracts of each sample (2 μg), prepared as previously described (20Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), with a labeled double stranded oligonucleotide containing an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) sequence derived from the ISG15 gene (21Levy D.E. Methods. 1998; 15: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The DNA binding affinity assay was performed as follows. Purified GST-IRF7DBD was mixed with 100 ng of purified recombinant PCAF in the presence of 100 μm acetylCoA for 30 min at 30 °C. Different amounts of the reaction mixture were then incubated with biotinylated DNA derived from the ISG15 gene. Bound materials were purified with streptavidin beads and revealed by immunoblotting using anti-IRF7 antibodies. Dissociation rates of protein-DNA complexes were determined essentially as described (22Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Fu X.Y. Levy D.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) using nuclear extracts from cells over-expressing IRF7WT or IRF7GTTR. The approximate half-life of the complex was determined by quantitative phosphorimaging Expression constructs for PCAF and GCN5 were kindly provided by Y. Nakatani and R. Schiltz (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and S. Roth (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The PCAF HAT mutant was provided by M. Rosenfeld. The GCN5 HAT mutant was described previously (23Paulson M. Press C. Smith E. Tanese N. Levy D.E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylase 1 expression construct was obtained from E. Verdin (Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA). IRF7 KR (K92R) and GTTR (G91T/T93R) mutants were generated by site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants of IRF7 Δ1–4 have been described elsewhere (10Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8803-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GST-IRF7DBD was generated by cloning the first 256 amino acids of IRF7 into the pGEX-2T vector using the BamHI and EcoRI sites. Luciferase activities were measured in cell lysates using commercial reagents as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega) and were normalized to β-galactosidase activity of a co-transfected CMV-lacZ plasmid measured on a luminescent substrate. Each construct was tested in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. Results shown are from a single experiment representative of results obtained. It has now been clearly demonstrated that virus-induced phosphorylation of IRF7 is an essential event for its activation (10Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8803-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We investigated other potential posttranslational modifications that may influence IRF7 activity. Recently, two other IRF family members, IRF1 and IRF2, have been shown to be acetylated by p300 and to a lesser degree by PCAF (24Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test whether IRF7 was acetylated in vivo, FLAG-tagged IRF7 was transfected and IRF7 was detected using an anti-acetylated lysine antibody after the extracts had been subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies. As previously observed, a slower migrating form of IRF7 corresponding to phosphorylated IRF7 was detected in NDV-infected extracts in addition to the latent IRF7 found in control extracts (5Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylated IRF7 could be observed in both NDV-infected and uninfected extracts, indicating that IRF7 is basally acetylated in the cell (Fig.1 A). To identify the enzyme responsible for IRF7 acetylation, a set of acetyltransferases (p300, GCN5, and PCAF) as well as the corresponding enzymatically inactive mutants (HAT mutants), were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged IRF7 in 293T cells. IRF7 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and subjected to an anti-acetylated lysine Western blot analysis to detect its level of acetylation (Fig. 1 B). Co-transfection of active PCAF resulted in a significant acetylation of IRF7 that was not observed when the HAT mutant form of PCAF was co-transfected. A darker exposure of the gel showed that IRF7 was also basally acetylated in the absence of transfected HAT proteins, although this acetylation was much weaker (data not shown). As previously described, we observed a strong auto-acetylation of PCAF (25Herrera J.E. Bergel M. Yang X.J. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27253-27258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, GCN5, but not the GCN5 HAT mutant, was able to acetylate IRF7 though to a much lesser extent than PCAF. In contrast, p300 did not cause IRF7 acetylation (data not shown). All three HAT proteins were active in that they were able to acetylate endogenous substrates in vivo in transfected cells (data not shown). Furthermore, over-expression of histone deacetylase 1 along with IRF7 and PCAF led to a significant decrease of the amount of acetylated IRF7. Taken together, these results show that IRF7 is subjected to reversible acetylation in vivo. To map the acetylation site(s), we co-transfected a series of deletion mutants of IRF7 along with PCAF in 293T cells. As shown in Fig.2 A (right panel), all the deletion mutants tested except Δ2, which is missing the DNA-binding domain, could still be acetylated by PCAF. Interestingly, the mutant Δ1, missing only part of the DNA-binding domain, was strongly acetylated. As mentioned above, acetylation occurs only on lysine residues, and only two lysine residues were found in the sequence of Δ1 that is missing in Δ2, at positions 43 and 92. Each lysine residue was individually mutated to arginine and the point mutants were tested for their ability to become acetylated by over-expressed PCAF. As shown in Fig. 2 A (right panel), the mutant K92R lost its ability to be acetylated, whereas K43R was acetylated as strongly as WTIRF7. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that lysine 92 substitution to arginine alters the recognition of IRF7 by PCAF, this result strongly suggests that IRF7 is acetylated by PCAF on residue 92. As expected, the double mutant K43R/K92R was also unable to be acetylated. Interestingly, lysine residue 92 is conserved throughout the IRF family, suggesting that it plays a fundamental role in transcription factor function (Fig.2 B). To characterize the role of lysine 92 in IRF7 function, we tested the ability of the K92R mutant to transactivate a typical IFNα gene promoter in a reporter assay. As depicted in Fig.3 A, K92R was completely devoid of activity on the IFNα6 promoter, whereas WT-IRF7 activated this promoter over 1000-fold following viral infection. However, the absence of activity could be due to impaired DNA binding rather than to the inability of the mutant to be acetylated. Indeed, as described for many other DNA-binding proteins, charged lysines are crucial for stabilizing DNA-protein complexes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the DNA binding ability of the K92R mutant by electromobility shift assay on an ISRE probe. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the K92R mutant was unable to bind DNA (compare lanes 3 and 4 withlanes 7 and 8). Because DNA binding ability of WT-IRF7 is dramatically increased upon virus-induced phosphorylation, it was important to ascertain whether the K92R mutant was phosphorylated in virus-infected cells. The presence of phosphorylated K92R mutant was monitored by the detection of a slower migrating band after immunoblotting of virus-infected cell extracts as observed for WT-IRF7. Fig. 3 C shows that K92R was phosphorylated in virus-infected cells. The slight diminution in phosphorylation compared with WTIRF7 is unlikely to account for the major difference observed in DNA binding. The abolition of DNA binding of the K92R mutant suggested that this lysine might play a crucial role for DNA binding independently of its acetylation status. To circumvent this problem, we sought to design an IRF7 mutant that could not be acetylated but retained DNA binding ability. In the course of understanding the structural determinants driving acetylation by PCAF, the acetylation status of the closely functionally and structurally related protein IRF3 was determined. Despite the close identity between the two proteins, no acetylation of IRF3 was detected in the presence of PCAF (see Fig.4 B, right panel,lane 6). Taking advantage of this observation, we designed a mutant where the amino acids surrounding the lysine acetylation target were changed into those of IRF3 (G91T/T93R) (Fig.4 A). First, we verified that G91T/T93R had lost its ability to be acetylated by PCAF, as intended. GTTR showed an undetectable level of acetylation, comparable with IRF3 or IRF7 deletion mutant Δ2 (Fig. 4 B, compare lane 2 with lanes 4and 6). This observation proved that the sequence context of the target lysine is a determinant for its acetylation by PCAF. Second, we tested whether this mutant retained DNA binding ability. GTTR was still able to bind DNA, although it exhibited an altered pattern in electromobility shift assay on an ISRE probe compared with WT-IRF7 (Fig. 4 C). In a reporter assay using the IFNα6 promoter, the IRF7GTTR mutant was over 30-fold more active than WT-IRF7 in control cells and over 5-fold more active after viral infection (Fig.4 D). Thus, this double point mutant of IRF7, which cannot be acetylated, displayed enhanced transcriptional activity. These results strongly suggested that acetylation of lysine 92 imposes an inhibitory effect on IRF7 activity. To confirm that this effect was due to acetylation, it was important to verify that over-expression of PCAF had no effect on IRF7GTTR DNA binding. As shown above (Fig.3 B, lanes 5 and 6), over-expression of PCAF led to decreased DNA binding activity, whereas over-expression of the PCAF HAT mutant had no effect on IRF7 DNA binding (Fig.4 E, left panel). In contrast, the IRF7GTTR mutant was not affected by PCAF over-expression, strongly suggesting that the inhibition of IRF7 DNA binding by PCAF was due to acetylation of lysine 92 (Fig. 4 E, right panel). However, the slight difference in DNA binding affinity between WT-IRF7 and IRF7GTTR was unlikely to account for the substantial difference observed in the transactivation activity assay. To explore possible reasons for the increased transactivation ability of IRF7GTTR, the stability of the IRF7GTTR and WT-IRF7 protein-DNA complexes were compared. The dissociation rate of each complex was measured by challenging the preformed complexes with a 500-fold molar excess of unlabelled ISRE oligonucleotide. Half-lives of the complexes were calculated by removing aliquots at serial time points and loading them onto a running non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Dissociation of WT-IRF7 from DNA was very rapid (<1 min), whereas the IRF7GTTR-ISRE interaction was strikingly more stable, with a half-life of around 60 min (Fig.4 F). This indicates that the non-acetylatable IRF7GTTR mutant has a substantially higher affinity for the ISRE, suggesting that acetylation strongly impairs IRF7 affinity for its cognate DNA. Interestingly, IRF3 complexes also showed a very high affinity for the ISRE element, consistent with the finding that IRF3 is not acetylated by PCAF (data not shown). To directly assess whether acetylation had an inhibitory effect on DNA binding, purified GST-IRF7 was acetylated in vitro by PCAF prior to incubation with biotinylated ISRE. ISRE-bound IRF7 was then purified and detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.5 A, acetylated IRF7 displayed decreased DNA affinity when compared with non-acetylated IRF7. Greater than 3-fold more IRF7 was recovered in the DNA-bound fraction in the absence of acetylation (compare the −AcetylCoA panel to the +AcetylCoA panel). This result is consistent with the finding that over-expression of PCAF led to reduced DNA binding in an electromobility shift assay, as shown in Fig. 3 B (comparelanes 5 and 6 to lanes 3 and4). To test whether acetylation-dependent inhibition of DNA binding impairs IRF7 activity, we co-transfected increasing amounts of PCAF along with IRF7 in a reporter assay. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of IRF7-mediated activation of the IFNα6 promoter in infected cells (Fig.5 B). The 2–3-fold inhibition observed in this assay correlates with the fold inhibition detected in the DNA affinity assay. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that acetylation of IRF7 by PCAF is a reversible mechanism that modulates IRF7 DNA binding and activity and targets a region that distinguishes IRF7 from its relative IRF3. Phosphorylation is considered the major posttranslational modification responsible for activating signal transduction pathways. However, acetylation has been recently shown to be a widespread mechanism involved in regulating transcription factor activity. Here we show that IRF7, a transducer of a virus-mediated signaling pathway, is acetylated on lysine 92 within the DNA-binding domain by the acetyltransferase PCAF. Moreover, acetylation of lysine 92 impaired DNA binding ability and thus decreased transcriptional activity. Our work is the first report of mapping an acetylation target residue for a protein of the IRF family. As mentioned above, IRF1 and 2 have been reported to be acetylated by p300 and PCAF within the DBD, but no alteration of DNA binding activity was observed (24Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the target residue(s) of acetylation were not mapped and therefore the correspondence between the acetylation of IRF1, IRF2, and IRF7 cannot be established. Recently, Suhara et al. (26Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) provided evidence that p300 had a direct contribution to the binding of IRF3 to DNA and that p300 was capable of acetylating IRF3 in vitrobut only when IRF3 was present as a dimer in the holocomplex. The authors also suggested that acetylation of IRF3 was fundamental for activation of the holocomplex because a p300 HAT mutant failed to confer DNA binding activity. It is worth noting that acetylation by HAT enzymes seems to be very specific because p300 acetylates IRF3 but is not able to acetylate IRF7 and that PCAF shows an inverse specificity. Furthermore, these two acetylation events, which most likely take place on different sites, have opposite effects on the DNA binding ability of IRF3 and IRF7. It is interesting to point out that, whereas an increase in activity has been observed upon acetylation of most transcription factors, some factors like HMGI(Y), YY1, and CDP/cut show decreased DNA binding when acetylated within their DNA-binding domain (27Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5979-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 29Li S. Aufiero B. Schiltz R.L. Walsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The effect of acetylation on DNA binding appears to correlate with the functional domain where it takes place. Although increased DNA binding generally results from acetylation in a domain nearby the DNA-binding domain (E2F, EKLF, and p53), acetylation of lysine residues within the DNA-binding domain has an inhibitory effect on DNA binding. As reported for other DNA-binding proteins, many of the residues contacting the negatively charged DNA backbone are positively charged lysine and arginine residues. According to the crystal structure of the IRF1 DNA-binding domain bound to a DNA element from the interferon-β promoter, lysine 78 (corresponding to lysine 92 in IRF7) is responsible for stabilizing the protein-DNA complex through hydrogen bonds (30Escalante C.R. Yie J. Thanos D. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The decreased DNA binding ability of IRF7 upon acetylation can be likely explained by the neutralization of the positive charge of lysine 92 that is responsible for tightening the bonds between the transcriptional complex and promoter. Though the mechanism driving IRF7 acetylation remains to be investigated, one can hypothesize that this phenomenon could be part of an auto-regulatory loop. Indeed, as an initial response to viral infection, cells produce a spectrum of early inflammatory cytokines, including interferon, that can both activate immune cells and directly inhibit viral replication. Host response to viral infection is potent and can be deleterious to the cell; thus it is essential for cell survival that this response be regulated in a precise spatial and temporal manner. It has been shown that, in the context of the interferon β enhanceosome, acetylation of HMGI(Y) on lysine 65 by CBP leads to destabilization and disassembly of the transcriptional complex (27Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Our results favor the hypothesis that acetylation of IRF7 may play a similar role in disrupting the transcriptional complex bound to interferon α promoters and turning off type I interferon gene induction. Alternatively, basal acetylation of IRF7 may be a regulatory step that prevents non-activated IRF7 from binding DNA with high affinity in the absence of the proper stimulus that will lead to its deacetylation. The kinetics and nature of the different stimuli leading to full activation of IRF7 and disruption of the active complex are not fully clarified and need further characterization. Thus, acetylation is likely to be a common mechanism for type I interferon gene repression. It is also notable that acetylation of IRF7 occurs in a region that distinguishes its DNA binding from that of IRF3. Although IRF3 displays relatively strong DNA binding, it has a weak transactivation domain that appears to be completely dependent on p300 for induction of gene expression. In contrast, IRF7 binds weakly to DNA due to a rapid off rate, and this binding can be further reduced by acetylation of lysine 92. However, the potent transactivation domain of IRF7 that functions independently from known co-activator HAT proteins produces robust induction of IFNα genes following viral infection. We thank Y.

https://openalex.org/W1988707159,"In renal collecting ducts, vasopressin increases the expression of and redistributes aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane, leading to urine concentration. However, basolateral membrane expression of AQP2, in addition to AQP3 and AQP4, is often detected in inner medullary principal cells in vivo. Here, potential mechanisms that regulate apical versus basolateral targeting of AQP2 were examined. The lack of AQP2-4 association into heterotetramers and the complete apical expression of AQP2 when highly expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells indicated that neither heterotetramerization of AQP2 with AQP3 and/or AQP4, nor high expression levels of AQP2 explained the basolateral AQP2 localization. However, long term hypertonicity, a feature of the inner medullary interstitium, resulted in an insertion of AQP2 into the basolateral membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells after acute forskolin stimulation. Similarly, a marked insertion of AQP2 into the basolateral membrane of principal cells was observed in the distal inner medulla from normal rats and Brattleboro rats after acute vasopressin treatment of tissue slices that had been chronically treated with vasopressin to increase interstitial osmolality in the medulla, but not in tissues from vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats. These data reveal for the first time that chronic hypertonicity can program cells in vitro and in vivo to change the insertion of a protein into the basolateral membrane instead of the apical membrane."

Xyloglucan is a major hemicellulose polysaccharide found in the primary cell wall of plants. It constitutes ∼20% of the total cell wall in dicot and non-graminaceous monocot plants and 5–10% of Gramineae cell walls. Xyloglucan associates with cellulose microfibrils by hydrogen bonding, forming a cellulose-xyloglucan network (1Hayashi T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 139-168Google Scholar, 2Fry S.C. Smith R.C. Renwick K.F. Martin D.J. Hodge S.K. Matthews K.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 821-828Google Scholar, 3Carpita N.C. Gibeaut D.M.

Xyloglucan consists of a cellulose-like backbone chain of β-1,4-linked β-d-Glcp residues that are frequently substituted at C-6 with side chains of α-d-Xylp-(1→6)-, 1The abbreviations used are: Xyl, xylose; OXG-RCBH, oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ORF, open reading frame. β-d-Galp-(1→2)-α-d-Xylp-(1→6)-, or α-l-Fucp-(1→2)-β-d-Galp-(1→2)-α-d-Xylp-(1→6)- residues.

Plant. 1993; 89: 1-3Google Scholar). Structural studies suggest that most xyloglucan consists of XXXG or XXGG repeating units (5Vincken J.P. York W.S. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 9-13Google Scholar). In dicots, treatment of xyloglucan with endo-β-1,4-glucanase results in the cleavage of unbranched, 4-linked Glc residues in the backbone chain, generating mainly oligosaccharide subunits (XXXG, XLXG, XXLG, XLLG, XXFG, XLFG, and so on) (6Kato Y. Matsuda K. BeMiller J.N. Manners D.J. Sturgeon R.J. Whistler R.L. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. X. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 207-216Google Scholar). Disassembly of the cellulose-xyloglucan network is required for cell expansion and development. Xyloglucan metabolism is thought to have an important role in cell definition, cell expansion, and regulation of plant growth and development (7York W.S. Darvill A.G. Albersheim P.

Recently, it was reported that xyloglucan integration by xyloglucan endotransglycosylase in the cell wall suppresses cell elongation, whereas that of the xyloglucan oligosaccharide XXXG accelerates elongation (12Takeda T. Furuta Y. Awano T. Mizuno K. Mitsuishi Y. Hayashi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9055-9060Google Scholar). It was proposed that xyloglucan metabolism controls plant cell elongation. In the growing plant cell wall, xyloglucan oligosaccharides may provide positive or negative feedback control during cell elongation. Consequently, compositional analysis of oligosaccharide units in xyloglucan polymers is very important. Glycosidases are useful tools for analyzing the fine structure of complex carbohydrates, and screening and characterizing novel glycosidases are important for ensuring progress in glycotechnology. In this study, we report the purification, characterization, cloning, and expression of a novel oligoxyloglucan-specific β-glycosidase produced by Geotrichum sp. M128 fungus, which was isolated from soil in Tsukuba, Japan. The enzyme recognized the reducing end of the oligoxyloglucan heptasaccharide XXXG and produced the tetrasaccharide XX and the trisaccharide XG. This enzymatic activity is very different from the activities of known glycosidases and constitutes a potentially powerful tool for the structural analysis of cell wall xyloglucan. It is also shown that the enzyme had minor activity for the reducing end of cello-oligosaccharides, releasing cellobiose. Based on these results, we propose oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase (OXG-RCBH) as the trivial name of this new enzyme. Geotrichum sp. M128 was isolated from soil in Tsukuba, Japan, and deposited in the International Patent Organism Depository, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Ibaraki, Japan) under FERM P-16454. Enzymatic activity was assayed by normal phase HPLC. The Geotrichum sp. M128 culture supernatant was incubated with 1% oligoxyloglucan heptasaccharide XXXG prepared using a previously described method (12Takeda T. Furuta Y. Awano T. Mizuno K. Mitsuishi Y. Hayashi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9055-9060Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 μl) was loaded onto a TSKgel Amide 80 column (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with 58% acetonitrile (isocratic) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min to analyze the degradation products. Product structures were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and 13C NMR spectroscopy. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded using a Kompact MALDI IV instrument (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) according to previously described methods (13Yamagaki T. Mitsuishi Y. Nakanishi H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2470-2475Google Scholar). NMR spectra were obtained with a JNM-GX270 apparatus (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo) at 68.5 MHz in the SGBCM mode, with complete proton decoupling at 24.5 °C, using D2O as a solvent in a 0.5-cm inner diameter tube. Chemical shifts were reported as δ (ppm) relative to the resonance of sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silopentano-1-sulfonate, which was used as an internal standard (δ = 0). The spectral width was 200 ppm. Geotrichum sp. M128 was cultivated in 4-liters cultures consisting of 0.8% xyloglucan from Tamarindus indica (Glyloid, Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan), 0.8% Bactopeptone, 0.2% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4, and 0.05% yeast extract (pH 6.0) at 30 °C for 6 days. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and the broth supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The concentrated supernatant was diluted with 25 mm imidazole HCl buffer (pH 7.4), loaded onto a chromatofocusing column containing Polybuffer Exchanger PBE media, PBE 94 (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 25 mm imidazole HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and then eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m). Each separated fraction was assayed for XXXG hydrolytic activity by the method of Nelson (14Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 153: 375-380Google Scholar) and Somogyi (15Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 160: 61-68Google Scholar, 16Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Google Scholar). The active fractions were pooled and then applied to the same column with a pH gradient using Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Biosciences). The active fractions were gel-filtrated twice with an HW55F column (Tosoh Co.). The final active fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Mcllvaine buffer solutions (pH 2.5–9.0), prepared from 0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate and 0.1m citric acid, were used to identify the optimum pH and to determine pH stability. The optimum pH was examined by incubation with the oligoxyloglucan heptasaccharide XXXG at 45 °C for 30 min in Mcllvaine buffer solutions. The pH stability was assayed by incubating the enzyme, in the absence of substrate, at 45 °C for 30 min in buffer solutions. The buffer solutions were then adjusted to pH 4.0, and the remaining activity was assayed. The optimum temperature was determined by incubation in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) at various temperatures. To analyze thermostability, the enzyme was incubated in the same buffer, without substrate, for 10 min at various temperatures. The remaining activity was then assayed at 45 °C. The substrate specificity of purified OXG-RCBH was analyzed with various, well defined xyloglucan oligosaccharide structures prepared from tamarind seed using previously described methods (17Konishi T. Mitsuishi Y. Kato Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2421-2424Google Scholar). The resulting products were analyzed by normal phase HPLC. The purified protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Millipore Corp.) in transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS (pH 11) and 10% methanol). The amino acid sequence was determined by automatic sequential Edman degradation using a Procise 494 HT protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). To determine internal amino acid sequences, the purified protein was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka). The resulting peptide fragments were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC on a TSKgel ODS-80Ts QA column (Tosoh Co.), and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were analyzed. Geotrichum sp. M128 total RNA was obtained from 3 ml of culture using a FastRNA RED kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The mRNA was prepared with an oligo(dT) column using a QuickPrep mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with an oligo(dT) primer using a TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). First, the cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR with degenerate primers designed from the N-terminal and internal (peptide 2) amino acid sequences: F1, 5′-GA(AG)CA(CT)TA(CT)GA(AG)TT(CT)AA(AG)AA(CT)GT-3′; and R1, 5′-GT(ACGT)CCCCA(AGT)AT(AG)AA(ACGT)AC(ACGT)GC-3′. The amplified fragment was subcloned into the T-overhang vector pGEM-T-Easy (Promega). Dideoxy double-stranded sequencing of the cDNA insert was performed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the expected amplified fragment was obtained and confirmed. The complete nucleotide sequences were determined by 5′- and 3′-RACE using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). For 5′-RACE, the following gene-specific primers were designed: R2, 5′-CGTACAGCAGGTCCTTGGTCTTTGG-3′; and R3 (nested primer), 5′-TAATGTACCCGCCGCCGCCGAT-3′. For 3′-RACE, F2 (5′-GGCAAGTTCTTCGTCTCGACCGAC-3′) and F3 (nested primer, 5′-CCAAGTCGGACGGCAAGAAGGCTA-3′) were used as the gene-specific primers. The cDNA fragment encoding the mature region of OXG-RCBH was amplified by PCR with primers designed from 5′- and 3′-sequences corresponding to the N- and C-terminal regions of the mature protein: F4, 5′-TCGCTCGCGCATATGAAGGAGCACTACGAGTTCAAGAATG-3′; and R4, 5′-TGGAAGATCTTTACTTTTTCACATAGCAGTGCGTGCCC-3′. TheNdeI and BglII sites (underlined) were added to the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and BglII, subcloned into the pET-29a(+) expression vector (Novagen), digested with the same restriction enzymes, and transfected into E. coliBL21-CodonPlus(DE3) RP (Stratagene). The transfected cells were cultured, and expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 37 °C. The recombinant protein was produced as an inclusion body that was extracted and partially purified with BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen). The protein was solubilized at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 8 m urea and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature and renatured by removing the urea by dialysis against 25 mm imidazole HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The oligoxyloglucan heptasaccharide XXXG was incubated with the Geotrichum sp. M128 culture supernatant, and the reaction products were separated by normal phase HPLC (Fig. 1B). Two products (a and b) were observed, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used to identify their structures. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the reaction products revealed the presence of two main components with m/z 497 andm/z 629, indicating that products a and b were the trisaccharide XG and the tetrasaccharide XX, respectively (Fig. 1D). The results of further structural analysis by13C NMR spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 2. The anomeric carbon chemical shifts were compared with those of xyloglucan oligosaccharides shown in Ref.18York W.S. van Halbeek H. Darvill A.G. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 200: 9-31Google Scholar. The results suggested that product a was the trisaccharide XG (Fig. 2A). Although XX dose data was not available in Ref. 18York W.S. van Halbeek H. Darvill A.G. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 200: 9-31Google Scholar, it seemed reasonable to conclude that product b was the tetrasaccharide XX (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that Geotrichumsp. M128 produced a glycosylhydrolase (OXG-RCBH in this study) that hydrolyzed XXXG to produce XX and XG in the culture supernatant.Figure 213 C NMR spectroscopy of products a (A) and b (B).

M128 culture supernatant, indicating that it was expressed as a secreted protein in the culture supernatant. OXG-RCBH was purified from the culture supernatant by liquid chromatography (Table I). Each separated fraction was assayed for XXXG hydrolytic activity. Throughout these steps, enzymatic activity always appeared as a single peak. The final purified fraction had an XXXG hydrolytic activity of 15.31 units/mg of protein (Table I). This fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, revealing a single 97-kDa band (Fig. 3). Chromatofocusing showed that its pI was 6.1 (data not shown).Table IPurification of OXG-RCBH from Geotrichum sp.

Open table in a new tab The effect of pH and temperature on purified OXG-RCBH was analyzed. The optimum pH was between 3.5 and 5.0, and the optimum temperature was between 50 and 60 °C. The pH stability was determined at 45 °C using Mcllvaine buffer solutions at various pH values. OXG-RCBH was stable between pH 4.0 and 8.0, where >90% of the activity was retained. Thermostability was analyzed at pH 4.0 by incubation at various temperatures for 10 min. More than 90% activity was retained at 50 °C. Various oligosaccharide structures were used to analyze the substrate specificity of OXG-RCBH, and the results are shown in Table II. OXG-RCBH had very unique substrate specificity; the results indicated that it was an exoglucanase that recognized the structure of the reducing end of oligoxyloglucan and that released the two glucosyl main chain residues (GG, XG, or LG). When there were less than three Glc residues on the main chain, the activity decreased significantly, suggesting that OXG-RCBH has at least four subsites (−2 to +2). It was very important that the reducing end of the Glc residue (site +2) was unbranched. No OXG-RCBH activity was seen for substrates with reducing ends branched with Xyl residues. It was also important that the third Glc residue from the reducing end (site −1) was branched with Xyl unmodified by a Gal residue. If this Glc residue was branched with Xyl modified with a Gal residue, OXG-RCBH was not active; and if it was unbranched, the activity decreased significantly. Based on these results, we propose the subsite image shown in Fig. 4.Table IISubstrate specificity of OXG-RCBHSubstrateRelative activityFinal products(%)XXXGXXXG96.7XXXGXX, XGXXXGG98.2XXX, GGXXXG100.0XX, XGXXLG96.5XX, LGXLXG0.0XLLG0.0GXXG60.2GX, XGXXGG64.8XX, GGGGGG5.7GG, GGXXX0.0XXG28.3X, XGGXG0.0XGG24.8X, GGGGG0.0 Open table in a new tab Purified OXG-RCBH was analyzed to determine its N-terminal amino acid sequences. The following 22 amino acids were determined: KEHYEFKNVAIGGGGYITGIVA. To analyze the internal amino acid sequences, OXG-RCBH was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the resulting peptide fragments were separated by reverse phase HPLC. Three peptide fragments were analyzed to obtain their N-terminal amino acid sequences. The amino acid sequences were as follows: peptide 1, DLLYARTDIGGA; peptide 2, ASAPSAVFIWGT; and peptide 3, VYGRVYLGT. PCR was carried out using cDNA from Geotrichum sp. M128 as a template and degenerate primers F1 and F2, designed from the N-terminal and internal (peptide 2) amino acid sequences. The resulting DNA fragment of ∼2 kilobase pairs was subcloned and sequenced. The complete cDNA nucleotide sequences were determined by 5′- and 3′-RACE, and the full-length cDNA encoding OXG-RCBH was successfully cloned. The cDNA sequence contained a 2436-bp open reading frame encoding a putative 812-amino acid protein (Fig. 5). The criteria for a Kozak consensus translational initiation site,GATATGG (19Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar, 20Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Google Scholar), were observed. The deduced amino acid sequence perfectly matched the partial amino acid sequences obtained from the purified protein. There were nine potentialN-glycosylation sites (NX(S/T)). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature protein started at the 24th amino acid residue, indicating that 23 amino acids were cleaved from the N terminus of the mature form. These 23 amino acids seem to be a signal sequence. N-terminal proteolytic cleavage resulted in an 85-kDa protein containing 789 amino acid residues. Because the native enzyme isolated from the Geotrichum sp. M128 culture had a molecular mass of 97 kDa, the difference in molecular mass between these two proteins may result from the presence of a carbohydrate or other post-translational modification. The deduced amino acid shows ∼31–37% identity to several proteins in the glyco hydrolase 74 (GH74) family (Fig. 6) (21Redenbach M. Kieser H.M. Denapaite D. Eichner A. Cullum J. Kinashi H.

Aspergillus aculeatus avicelase III (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB015511) was proposed as an exoglucanase, but functional analysis has not yet been conducted.Aspergillus niger EglC has been analyzed, and it was reported that it exhibits endoglucanase activity for azo-carboxymethyl cellulose, azurin-dyed and cross-linked-cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, β-glucan, and xyloglucan (26Hasper A.A. Dekkers E. van Mil M. van de Vondervoort P.J.I. de Graaff L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1556-1560Google Scholar). On the other hand, OXG-RCBH had exoglucanase activity, recognized the reducing end of oligoxyloglucan, and produced two glucosyl residue segments, as described above. This action is similar to that of Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I (27Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K.C. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Google Scholar), which cleaves cellulose at the reducing end to produce cellobiose. However, no sequence similarity was observed between these proteins. To demonstrate that the protein encoded by the cloned cDNA had enzymatic activity, cDNA was expressed in E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) RP. This strain has extra copies of the genes argU andploL, which encode tRNAs that recognize the arginine codons AGA and AGG and the proline codon CCC, respectively. Many of them, particularly CCC, are found in OXG-RCBH cDNA. Although we tried expressing OXG-RCBH in another host strain (BL21(DE3)), the expression level was lower than in BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) RP (data not shown). A protein of ∼85 kDa was expressed in the cells (Fig. 7, lane 5). Under the conditions we tested, recombinant OXG-RCBH was expressed as an insoluble inclusion body (Fig. 7, lane 7), like many other enzymes. Even when induction conditions were changed (e.g.induction temperature of 20 °C and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside concentration of 0.1 mm or a different host cell strain), no OXG-RCBH activity was observed in the soluble fraction (data not shown). We tried to renature recombinant OXG-RCBH. Purified inclusion body (Fig. 7,lane 8) was solubilized in 8 m urea and renatured by dialysis. Using this procedure, renaturation was successful, and enzymatically active recombinant OXG-RCBH was obtained (11.60 units/mg of protein). The yield of refolded recombinant OXG-RCBH was >100 mg from 1 liter of culture. Testing the effects of pH and temperature on recombinant OXG-RCBH revealed that they were very close to those on native OXG-RCBH. Therefore, the recombinant OXG-RCBH found in this study will be useful for further analyses such as studies of molecular mechanisms of action and structural analysis. In this study, we described a novel oligoxyloglucan-specific β-glycosidase, OXG-RCBH, fromGeotrichum sp. M128 that was purified, characterized, cloned, and expressed in E. coli cells. OXG-RCBH recognized the reducing end of oligoxyloglucan and produced two glucosyl residue segments. Although several β-1,4-glucanases with specific activity for xyloglucan have been reported (26Hasper A.A. Dekkers E. van Mil M. van de Vondervoort P.J.I. de Graaff L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1556-1560Google Scholar, 28Vincken J.P. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 298: 299-310Google Scholar, 29Pauly M. Andersen L.N. Kauppinen S. Kofod L.V. York W.S. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 93-100Google Scholar), OXG-RCBH activity was very different from known glycosidase activities. OXG-RCBH should prove to be a powerful tool for identifying the fine structure of oligoxyloglucan."
https://openalex.org/W1985392046,"The six-transmembrane channels are thought to be composed of two modules: pore and sensor. Whereas the modular design of the pore has been established, the modularity of the sensor remains hypothetical. As a first step toward establishing the modularity of this region, we searched for genes where the sensor is found independent of the pore and have identified new members of the sensor superfamily. Analysis of these sensors reveals a motif shared among not only these newly discovered members and voltage-gated, transient receptor potential, and polycystin channel sensors, but also MscL, a bacterial mechanosensitive channel. Mutational analyses presented here and in previous studies demonstrate that highly conserved residues within this motif are required for normal channel activity; mutations of residues within this motif in different subfamilies lead to consistent channel phenotypes. Previous studies have demonstrated that peptides containing this motif and the adjacent conserved transmembrane domain elicit channel activities when reconstituted into lipid membranes. These data provide evidence for the modularity of the sensor, imply a model for its evolution, suggest a common origin for mechano- and voltage-sensing, and may offer a glimpse of the properties of the first sensor/channel."
https://openalex.org/W2041096316,"Functional properties of heparan sulfate (HS) are generally ascribed to the sulfation pattern of the polysaccharide. However, recently reported functional implications of rareN-unsubstituted glucosamine (GlcNH2) residues in native HS prompted our structural characterization of sequences around such residues. HS preparations were cleaved with nitrous acid at either N-sulfated or N-unsubstituted glucosamine units followed by reduction with NaB3H4. The labeled products were characterized following complementary deamination steps. The proportion of GlcNH2 units varied from 0.7–4% of total glucosamine in different HS preparations. The GlcNH2 units occurred largely clustered at the polysaccharide-protein linkage region in intestinal HS, also more peripherally in aortic HS. They were preferentially located within N-acetylated domains, or in transition sequences between N-acetylated andN-sulfated domains, only 20–30% of the adjacent upstream and downstream disaccharide units being N-sulfated. The nearest downstream (toward the polysaccharide-protein linkage) hexuronic acid was invariably GlcUA, whereas the upstream neighbor could be either GlcUA or IdoUA. The highly sulfated butN-unsubstituted disaccharide unit, -IdoUA2S-GlcNH26S-, was detected in human renal and porcine intestinal HS, but not in HS from human aorta.

Their biological functions generally involve the carbohydrate moieties, i.e. one or more HS chains. These linear, sulfate-substituted glycosaminoglycans associate with basic amino acid residues in target proteins, sometimes through highly specific sequence motifs in the HS chain (see also reviews in Refs. 7Spillmann D.

The proteinase inhibitor antithrombin thus binds to a unique pentasaccharide sequence that contains a rare 3-O-sulfatedd-glucosamine (GlcN) unit (9Bourin M.C. Lindahl U. Biochem.

This precursor is modified through a series of enzymatic reactions, initiated by N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues. The resultant N-sulfated GlcN (GlcNS) residues are prerequisite to subsequent modification, involving C5-epimerization of GlcUA to l-iduronic acid (IdoUA),O-sulfation at C2 of the hexuronic acid (HexUA,i.e. GlcUA or IdoUA) and O-sulfation at C6 of GlcNS or GlcNAc units, or, less common, at C3 of GlcNS. Heparin is more extensively modified, resulting in a saccharide structure highly enriched in IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S disaccharide units, whereas the modification of HS chains is more restrained. The HS structure is typically heterogeneous, with blocks of N-sulfated sequences (NS-domains) interspersed between unmodified, N-acetylated regions (NA-domains) and mixed NA/NS domains that consist of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units (12Maccarana M.

O-Sulfate groups and IdoUA units occur in the NS- and NA/NS- but not in the NA-domains.

The rare structural components presumably contribute to selective protein binding. The occurrence ofN-unsubstituted GlcN (GlcNH2) units was early recognized but largely ignored, since it was believed to reflect artificial loss of N-sulfate groups during handling of HS samples (17Höök M. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, findings of recent years not only revealed GlcNH2 residues in native HS structures, but also implicated such components with important cell-biological and pathophysiological phenomena. A monoclonal antibody that recognized GlcNH2 units in HS thus bound in selective fashion to extracellular tissue components in fresh-frozen rat kidney (18van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H.

The presence of GlcNH2 residues was found to correlate with the ability of bovine and human endothelial HS to bindl-selectin (although binding was not critically dependent on the GlcNH2 residues) (19Norgard-Sumnicht K. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12012-12024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, GlcNH2units were identified as targets for a 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform (3-OST-3A) that introduces a sulfate substituent at C3 (20Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R.

Finally, it was proposed that GlcNH2 residues provide cleavage sites in HS chains for endogenous NO-derived nitrite and thus contribute to recycling of glypican-1 (25Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The overall contents of GlcNH2 residues, generally low, vary between HS species.

We here report a comprehensive structural analysis of GlcNH2-containing sequences in HS from human aorta and kidney and from porcine intestine.RESULTSContents of N-Unsubstituted Glucosamine Residues in Heparan Sulfate PreparationsHS preparations from three sources were investigated,i.e. human aorta, human kidney, and porcine intestine. To determine the contents of GlcNH2 units, each HS species was treated with nitrous acid at pH 3.9 to specifically convert these units to terminal 2,5-anhydromannose residues. Reduction with NaB3H4 afforded [3H]aManR residues, the incorporated radioactivity indicating the GlcNH2 contents of the original HS samples. The molar proportions of GlcNH2residues were calculated based on the radioactivity incorporated into heparin standard disaccharides that had been reduced with the same batch of NaB3H4. The GlcNH2 content varied between the HS preparations and was highest (4% of total disaccharide units) in human aortic HS, intermediate (2%) in human renal HS, and lowest (0.7%) in porcine intestinal HS. Approximate estimates of molecular size by gel chromatography gave peak values for the intact intestinal and aortic HSs of ∼30 kDa and ∼45 kDa, respectively, both preparations being quite polydisperse (Fig.1). These data allowed us to estimate the average number of GlcNH2 units per polysaccharide chain, ∼0.5 for intestinal HS and ∼4 for aortic HS.Gel chromatography (Superose 6) of intestinal HS following HNO2-pH 3.9 treatment (GlcNH2 target residues) showed only minimal change compared with untreated control (Fig.1 A), suggesting that any GlcNH2 unit(s) present would be located close to either chain terminus. End-group-labeled deamination products obtained by reduction with NaB3H4 contained 20–30% each of di- and tetrasaccharides, the remaining ∼50% being larger than 4-mers (gel chromatography data not shown; Table I). The size distribution of the latter components approximated a number-average representation of the intact chains (Fig.1 A), suggesting a GlcNH2 residue located toward the carbohydrate-protein linkage region. The formation also of smaller deamination products, di- and tetrasaccharides, points to the presence of two or more clustered GlcNH2 residues in a small proportion of the chains, alternatively a single GlcNH2residue located very close to the non-reducing chain terminus.Table ICharacterization of products obtained by deamination and radiolabeling of N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues in heparan sulfatesHS sampleGlcNH2-containing disaccharide units1-aPercent of total disaccharide units.Labeled oligosaccharides formed on HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment of HS samplesLabeled products formed on HNO2-pH 1.5 treatment of4-mer≥6-mer2-mer4-mer≥6-mer4′-mer2′-mer≥6′-mer4′-mer2′-mer%%%%Human aorta49.016757822473320Human kidney22019618317483022Porcine intestine0.72824488812403426HS samples were treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9, and the products were reduced with NaB3H4. The resultant labeled oligosaccharides (2-, 4-, and ≥6-mers) were recovered by gel chromatography (Sephadex G-15; see Fig. 3 A) and quantified. The amounts of GlcNH2 residues were calculated using labeled disaccharides from heparin as standard.

Open table in a new tab By contrast, gel chromatography of aortic HS following HNO2-pH 3.9 treatment showed polydisperse products ranging from ∼40 kDa to <10 kDa in size, only partly overlapping the intact untreated polysaccharide (Fig. 1 B). Notably, these elution patterns were based on colorimetric HexUA analysis, and the deamination products observed thus were derived from regions upstream3as well as downstream of any GlcNH2 units in the chains. End-group-labeled deamination products fell largely into the low molecular weight range, more than half being smaller than 12-mers (Figs. 1 B, 3; Tables I and II). Most of these oligosaccharides had presumably been generated by excision of saccharide domains between GlcNH2 units. Each chain of aortic HS contained on average ∼4 such residues, hence the appreciable depolymerization of the unlabeled HS chains upon deamination (Fig. 1 B). Chemical N-acetylation of the HS precluded depolymerization as well as the formation of labeled oligosaccharides upon subsequent HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment (data not shown).Figure 3Gel chromatography of 3H-labeled saccharides obtained by HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment of HS. HS from human aorta was cleaved at GlcNH2 units and the products were radiolabeled (HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4treatment) and separated by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-15 (A). The resultant ≥6-mers were separated further by gel chromatography on BioGel P-10 (B).

Fractions were pooled and deaminated with HNO2 at pH 1.5, and the products were separately analyzed by gel chromatography (Fig. 4). The proportions of labeled components remaining at the elution position of the corresponding intact oligosaccharide were calculated and assumed to indicate the amounts of fully N-acetylated sequence. The degradation products derived from oligomers containing one or moreN-sulfated GlcN units in various positions were quantified and used to calculate the proportion of partially N-sulfated sequence.2-a N.D., not determined.

Open table in a new tab Characterization of Saccharide Sequences Upstream of N-Unsubstituted Glucosamine ResiduesN-Substituent PatternThe N-substituent pattern of sequences upstream of GlcNH2 was assessed by characterization of the labeled oligomers obtained after HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment of polysaccharide (procedure outlined in Fig. 2). The three HS samples all yielded labeled 2-mer, 4-mer, and ≥6-mer, although in somewhat variable proportions (Table I; gel chromatogram shown for aortic HS in Fig. 3 A). The disaccharides would represent a sequence of two adjacent GlcNH2 units with an intervening HexUA residue (sequence a in Fig. 9), whereas the tetrasaccharides were derived from a (-GlcNH2-)HexUA-GlcNR-HexUA-GlcNH2- structure (where R is an N-acetyl or an N-sulfate group). 4The 3H-labeled oligosaccharides generated by HNO2-pH 3.9 treatment would represent either sequences located between two GlcNH2 residues or the nonreducing termini of HS chains released through cleavage of a single internal GlcNH2 unit. Since the aortic HS contains on average ∼4 GlcNH2 residues per chain, the latter alternative will apply to only a minor proportion of the structures deduced. To identify theN-substituents of the internal GlcNR units, the tetrasaccharides were reacted with HNO2 at pH 1.5 (cleavage at GlcNS residues), and the amounts of labeled disaccharide released were determined by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-15 (not shown). Thus 12–22% of the tetrasaccharides were found to contain an internal GlcNS unit, the remainder being N-acetylated (Table I; note ′-designation to distinguish products from fragments generated in the initial HNO2-pH 3.9 deamination). The corresponding intact sequences in aortic HS are illustrated by structures b andc in Fig. 9.Figure 9Overview of GlcNH2-containing structures in aortic HS. The frequencies of all identified upstream and downstream sequences were assessed as described in the text. The frequencies of downstream sequences are based on the data in Table IV, after adjustment for sequences a*, c*,and f* that are identical to sequences a,c, and f. The indicated frequencies ofa*, c* and f* type sequences are maximal values, calculated on the assumption that each of these sequences are located between two GlcNH2residues.4 Identity of HexUA and the positions ofO-sulfate groups have not been considered in this scheme. The symbols are as in Fig. 2. The + sign in sequence eindicates the obligatory presence of at least one N-sulfated disaccharide unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The major fractions of labeled ≥6-mers recovered after HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment represent sequences of ≥5 monosaccharide units interspersed between GlcNH2 residues in the intact HS chain. Deamination at pH 1.5 of the entire ≥6-mer fractions resulted in strikingly similar degradation patterns (not shown) for the three HS species, with increasing amounts of 2′-mer, 4′-mer, and residual ≥6′-mer, in the order mentioned (Table I). The yield of disaccharide defines the proportion of sequence d in Fig. 9, whereas the tetrasaccharides account for part of sequence e; about 25% of the GlcNH2 residues in aortic HS are linked to an upstream -GlcNS-HexUA-GlcNAc-HexUA- structure. To obtain information about more remote upstream regions, the initial ≥6-mer fraction of aorta HS (HNO2-pH 3.9 cleavage) was separated further by gel chromatography on BioGel P-10 (Fig. 3 B). A series of poorly resolved components was obtained, including an appreciable proportion of material excluded from the gel (≥10 kDa; see also Fig.1 B). The parent HS chains thus contained regions with closely adjacent GlcNH2 residues as well as extended regions lacking such residues. The clearly discernible 6- to 12-mer fractions were recovered and separately subjected to HNO2-pH 1.5 treatment (Fig. 4,A–D). A major portion of each end-labeled species was fragmented into smaller, even-numbered oligomers, indicative of N-sulfate groups. The oligosaccharide patterns locate GlcNS units to all potential positions upstream of GlcNH2 residues. Nevertheless, a fraction of each labeled oligosaccharide retained the elution position of the initial HNO2-pH 3.9 deamination product, suggesting that two GlcNH2 units may be connected by fullyN-acetylated -[HexUA-GlcNAc]n-HexUA- stretches of variable length.4 The proportions of such deamination-resistant label were determined for each oligosaccharide in Fig. 4 and used to calculate the ratio between sequences fullyN-acetylated (∼20%) and those containing one or moreN-sulfate groups (∼80%) (TableII; sequences f ande, respectively, Fig. 9).Figure 4Cleavage at GlcNS residues of3H-labeled saccharides obtained by HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4treatment of HS. Labeled oligomers formed on HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment of aortic HS were separated (Fig. 3) and 6- to 12-mer fractions were individually reacted with HNO2 at pH 1.5. Each sample was analyzed by gel chromatography on Superdex 30 before (solid line) and after (broken line) HNO2-pH 1.5 treatment. Oligomer size is indicated above each peak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hexuronic Acid and O-Sulfate ResiduesSubstrate recognition by the GlcUA C5-epimerase that converts GlcUA to IdoUA residues requires that the adjacent upstream GlcN unit be N-sulfated, whereas the adjacent downstream GlcN unit may be eitherN-acetylated or N-sulfated (35Jacobsson I. Lindahl U. Jensen J.W. Rodén L. Prihar H. Feingold D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1056-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HexUA in -GlcNAc-HexUA-GlcNAc- or -GlcNAc-HexUA-GlcNS- sequences thus is invariably GlcUA, whereas that in -GlcNS-HexUA-GlcNAc- or -GlcNS-HexUA-GlcNS- may be either GlcUA or IdoUA. The influence of anN-unsubstituted GlcN residue on the C5-configuration of nearby HexUA units has not been investigated. We therefore identified the labeled disaccharide released by HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment of aortic HS, and found GlcUA-[3H]aManR as the only identifiable component (by anion-exchange HPLC and paper chromatography; data not shown), corresponding to a (-GlcNH2-)GlcUA-GlcNH2- sequence (ain Fig. 9) in the intact polymer.The ≥6-mers obtained by HNO2-pH 3.9/NaB3H4 treatment were deaminated at pH 1.5, and the resultant labeled 2′-mers were identified to provide information regarding the native -GlcNS-HexUA-GlcNH2- structures (Fig. 9 d). Appreciable variability was observed (Table III), with both GlcUA and IdoUA residues immediately upstream of the GlcNH2 unit, andO-sulfate groups both at C2 of IdoUA and at C6 of GlcNH2. Notably, the relative amounts of the different disaccharides differed considerably between the HS species. Analysis of [3H]disaccharides from sequence b in aortic HS gave a pattern (not shown) essentially similar to the corresponding disaccharide relating to sequence d (Table III). Labeled 4′-mers and ≥6′-mers ([HexUA-GlcNAc]≥1-HexUA-[3H]aManRoligosaccharides) obtained after HNO2-pH 1.5 treatment were analyzed to identify the radiolabeled reducing-terminal disaccharide unit. Cleavage of the oligosaccharides by HNO2-pH 3.9 treatment following hydrazinolysis yielded GlcUA-[3H]aManR exclusively (data not shown). The corresponding native sequence thus, as expected, is identified as -GlcNAc-GlcUA-GlcNH2- (Fig. 9, e andf).Table IIIComposition of (-GlcNS-)HexUA-GlcNH2-derived disaccharidesHS sampleGlcUA-aManRIdoUA-aManRGlcUA"

Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Google Scholar). Mice deficient for RANKL or RANK are osteopetrotic because of failure of osteoclast formation (5Kong Y.Y. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Immunol.

The decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG) is critical for its ability to bind RANKL and inhibit osteoclast formation (3Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr.

Furthermore, other protein inhibitors of osteoclast formation have been discovered that might act independently of the RANK signaling pathway (10Horwood N.J. Udagawa N. Elliott J. Grail D. Okamura H.

Among these is osteoclast inhibitory lectin (OCIL), a 207-amino acid type II transmembrane C-type lectin, which inhibits osteoclast formation in vitro in cocultures of osteoblastic stromal cells with hemopoietic cells in a lymphocyte-independent manner (14Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J. Quinn J.M. McKinstry W.J. Gillespie M.T. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14916-14923Google Scholar). The production of OCIL by osteoblasts and chondrocytes, its similar tissue distribution to that of RANKL, and the fact that it primarily inhibits osteoclast formation in the early (proliferative) phase, together raise the possibility that OCIL might have a direct action to oppose RANKL in the control of osteoclastogenesis (14Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J. Quinn J.M. McKinstry W.J. Gillespie M.T. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14916-14923Google Scholar). There is a large family of proteins containing C-type lectin domains, and we noted the 36% homology between the C-type lectin domains of OCIL and CD-69 (14Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J.

In the present work we report the finding of two further proteins that are very closely related to OCIL, but are the products of separate genes. In an effort to evaluate the relative roles of this family of proteins in bone, we have determined their gene structures and also studied their biological actions, tissue distribution, and regulation. Primary mouse osteoblastic cells were prepared from the calvaria of newborn C57BL/6J mice by digestion with collagenase as previously described (10Horwood N.J. Udagawa N. Elliott J. Grail D.

Incubation was carried out at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere equilibrated with 5% CO2 in air. M-CSF was a gift from Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant murine RANKL was obtained from Preprotech Inc. (Canton, MA). Recombinant human IL-11 was purchased form R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents were of analytical grade obtained from standard suppliers. Total RNA was isolated from ST2 mouse stromal cells, primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts, spleen, and liver tissue. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA by incubating for 1 h at 42 °C with 15 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) following oligo(dT) priming. For PCR, the sense strand oligonucleotide OCILm32 (5′-GCAACAAAGACAGAACAGATC-3′, nucleotides for mOCIL, GenBankTMAF321553) and the antisense strand oligonucleotide OCILm12 (5′-GGGACCATAGGGGAAAGAGTAG-3′, nucleotides for mOCIL, GenBankTMAF321553) were used. PCR was run at 94 °C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The resultant PCR fragments were cloned into a pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) vector. Upon nucleotide sequence analysis, mOCIL and two related but distinct cDNAs (mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2) were identified. The full-length sequences (mOCILrP1: 1096 bp, GenBankTMAY137341; mOCILrP1b: 984 bp, GenBankTMAY137342; mOCILrP2: 1026 bp, GenBankTMAY137344; mOCILrP2b: 1014 bp, GenBankTMAY137345) were identified by 5′- and 3′-RACE using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA isolated from mouse bone marrow and spleen cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was further amplified by PCR using OCILr25 (5′-CTCAGTGTTGTCTGTCCACTTCCAAGGG-3′, which is nonspecific to mOCIL family members and is capable of amplifying mOCIL, mOCILrP1, and mOCILrP2, located 3′ to the transmembrane domain) and UNP as the 5′-anchored primer, in a touchdown PCR protocol with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, then 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and then 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 1 min. A 3′-RACE strategy was also used to obtain the 3′-ends of the mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 cDNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA isolated from mouse bone marrow and spleen cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was further amplified by PCR using OCILm137 (5′-CCCTTGGAAGTGGACAGACAACACTGAG-3′, which is reverse and complementary to primer OCILr25) and UNP primer as the 3′-anchored primer in a touchdown PCR protocol with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, then 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and then 5 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 70 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 1 min. A cDNA fragment corresponding to the extracellular domain of mOCIL was used as a probe to screen a genomic BAC Mouse I hybridization library (Genome Systems, Inc.), and positive clones were isolated and screened. After the genomic DNA was digested withHindIII, Southern blot analyses were carried out with the same cDNA probe. The sequences of these BAC clones were determined by nucleotide sequencing of subcloned genomic fragments into pBS or by direct sequencing of the genomic clone DNA using cycle sequencing. Genomic sequences are provided in GenBankTM: mOCIL (AY137338), mOCILrP1 (AY137339 and AY137340), and mOCILrP2 (AY137343). PCR fragments specifying the extracellular domains of mOCILrP1 (amino acid residues 77–207) and mOCILrP2 (amino acid residues 92–217) were amplified from cDNA clones by PCR using the primers OCILm88 (5′-TCAGAATTCACCTATGCTGCTTGCCCGAA-3′) and OCILm89 (5′-TCAGAATTCACCTATGCTGCTTGCTCAAA-3′) as sense primers for mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2, respectively (both oligonucleotides introduce anEcoRI restriction endonuclease site 5′ to mOCIL coding sequence) along with OCILm97 (5′-CGACTCTAGAGGGACCATAGGGGAAAAAGTAG-3′) as antisense primer for both mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 that introduces aXbaI site. The PCR fragments were subcloned into theEcoRI and XbaI sites of the plasmid pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), creating a C-terminal mOCIL fusion with the MBP (maltose-binding protein)-encoding malE gene. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified as previously described (14Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J. Quinn J.M. McKinstry W.J. Gillespie M.T. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14916-14923Google Scholar). Mouse bone marrow and spleen cells were prepared from adult C57BL/6J mice, and T cell-depleted spleen cells were obtained as described (10Horwood N.J. Udagawa N. Elliott J. Grail D. Okamura H. Kurimoto M. Dunn A.R. Martin T. Gillespie M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 595-603Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 7 days in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 ng/ml M-CSF, and 50 ng/ml sRANKL in the absence or presence of recombinant MBP control or recombinant MBP-mOCIL, MBP-mOCILrP1, or MBP-mOCILrP2 fusion protein, respectively, at various concentrations as indicated. Treatments were added on day 0 and with the medium changed on day 3. After 7 days, cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using an acid phosphatase leukocyte commercial kit (Sigma) as previously described (12Horwood N.J. Elliott J. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4915-4921Google Scholar). Skeletal and extraskeletal tissues were obtained from C57Bl/6J male mice and processed as described (15Kartsogiannis V. Udagawa N. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Moseley J.M. Zhou H. Bone. 1998; 22: 189-194Google Scholar,16Kartsogiannis V. Zhou H. Horwood N.J. Thomas R.J. Hards D.K. Quinn J.M. Niforas P. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Bone. 1999; 25: 525-534Google Scholar). The peptide mOCIL-3 (H-Cys-Val-Thr-Lys-Ala-Ser-Leu-Pro-Met-Leu-Ser-Pro-Thr-Gly-Ser-Pro-Gln-Glu-NH2) is located in the intracellular domain and is specific to mOCIL, while the OCILrP-2 peptide (H-Cys-Val-Gln-Lys-Pro-Glu-Glu-Gly-Asn-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Thr-Gly-Asp-NH2) is located in the intracellular domain of mOCILrP2; this mOCILrP-2 peptide shares no identity with mOCIL, but has 9 of 15 amino acids in identity with mOCILrP1 (see sequences in Fig. 1). The peptides were synthesized, coupled with hemacyanin, and used to immunize rabbits, using standard protocols (17Danks J.A. Ebeling P.R. Hayman J.A. Diefenbach-Jagger H. Collier F.M. Grill V. Southby J. Moseley J.M. Chou S.T. Martin T.J. J. Pathol. 1990; 161: 27-33Google Scholar). The standard peroxidase-labeled streptavidin-biotin detection method was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) with minor modifications. The dilutions of the antiserum used were optimized in preliminary experiments. Incubation of tissue sections with a 1:200–1:400 dilution of the primary antiserum was carried out overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. Peroxidase activity was detected with 3′-3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich Pty. Ltd.) and 0.15% H2O2. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated and mounted on a coverslip as previously described (15Kartsogiannis V. Udagawa N. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Moseley J.M. Zhou H. Bone. 1998; 22: 189-194Google Scholar, 16Kartsogiannis V. Zhou H. Horwood N.J. Thomas R.J. Hards D.K. Quinn J.M. Niforas P. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Bone. 1999; 25: 525-534Google Scholar). To confirm specificity of immunostaining with mOCIL or mOCILrP1/mOCILrP2 antisera, sections were preabsorbed with 50 μg/ml of their respective peptides for 60 min prior to addition of antiserum. The following oligonucleotides were used for RT-PCR: OCILm111 (5′-GGCTTCCCTACCTATGCTTAGTC-3′, sense strand-specific primer for mOCIL, nucleotides 74–96, GenBankTMAF321553), OCILm114 (5′-TCTCCAAAGAAATAGTCTCAGAG-3′, sense strand specific for mOCILrP1, nucleotides 238–260, GenBankTMAY137341) and OCILm113 (5′-CTCCACTGTGTCTCCTGTTAAA-3′, sense strand-specific primer for mOCILrP2, nucleotides 197–218, GenBankTMAY137344) with OCILm81 (5′-TGCTCTGACGACTCTCTGTG-3′, an antisense oligonucleotide common to all three OCIL family members, nucleotides 480–499 for mOCIL, GenBankTMAF321553). Verification and quantification of PCR product was performed by Southern transfer and detection using the internal oligonucleotide probe OCILm115 (5′-CCTCTTGTGCCATGCAGAAG-3′, an antisense oligonucleotide common to all three OCIL family members, nucleotides 377–396 for mOCIL, GenBankTMAF321553) was carried out as reported (14Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J. Quinn J.M. McKinstry W.J. Gillespie M.T. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14916-14923Google Scholar). As a normalizing control, murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified with oligonucleotides GAPDH-2 and GAPDH-4, and verified with GAPDH-1 as previously described (14Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J. Quinn J.M. McKinstry W.J. Gillespie M.T. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14916-14923Google Scholar). Statistics were performed using Student's t test and expressed as mean ± S.E. Additional members of the OCIL family were identified during the characterization of the expression of mOCIL in ST2 mouse stromal cells, primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts, spleen, and liver tissue by RT-PCR with primers OCILm32 and OCILm12. PCR products from bone marrow were cloned into pGEM-T, and subsequent nucleotide analysis of 12 clones revealed the presence of mOCIL (six clones) and two other highly related but distinct OCIL sequences (four and two clones). By 5′- and 3′-RACE, the full sequences of these two mOCIL-related cDNAs were determined, which we now call OCIL-related protein 1 (OCILrP1) and OCILrP2, respectively. Alternatively spliced isoforms of OCILrP1 and OCILrP2 were also identified by 5′-RACE. A 112-bp truncation was noted in 5′-untranslated region in mOCILrP1, and a 12-bp deletion in the intracellular domain was identified in OCILrP2: the latter corresponding to a 4-amino acid deletion that maintained the reading frame and we have denoted this isoform mOCILrP2b. The deduced protein sequences derived from mOCILrP1, mOCILrP2 cDNA sequences and their homology are compared with mOCIL in Fig. 1. The predicted structures of mOCILrP1, mOCILrP2, and mOCILrP2b are similar to that of mOCIL and are typical of a type II membrane protein. Each protein is predicted to contain a 113-amino acid C-lectin type motif, and the extracellular domains share five cysteine residues, and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites in common (Fig. 1). mOCILrP1 has an open reading frame encoding a 207-amino acid protein, with a predicted 142 amino acid extracellular domain, a 21 amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 44 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. mOCILrP2 is predicted to be a 217 amino acid protein, composed of a 141 amino acid extracellular domain, a 21 amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 55 amino acid cytoplasmic domain; mOCILrP2b differs from mOCILrP2 by having a 51 amino acid cytoplasmic domain, with amino acids Val36–Cys39 deleted. The extracellular domains of mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 are well conserved sharing 83 and 74% amino acid identity (92 and 89% nucleotide identity), respectively, with the extracellular domain of mOCIL, and 79% between mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 (91% nucleotide identity). In contrast, the sequence identity in the intracellular domains of mOCILrP1 (41%) and mOCILrP2 (33%) with mOCIL are reduced, although clusters of amino acid identity are maintained (Fig. 1). Comparison of the protein sequences in the intracellular domain against the PROSITE data base, revealed that mOCIL has a casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation site (16Kartsogiannis V. Zhou H.

To isolate the murine OCIL gene, a genomic BAC Mouse I library was screened with a cDNA probe corresponding to the extracellular domain of mOCIL, and 8 positive BAC clones were identified. Two BAC clones (db. 20149 and db. 20152) were selected for further analysis as a result of different hybridization profiles from Southern blotting ofHindIII-digested murine DNA. Sequencing of 8622 bp of the BAC clone (db. 20152) was completed and based on identity with the cDNA sequence for mOCIL, identified as the mOCIL gene, containing 5 exons (Fig. 2). The 5′-flanking region adjacent to exon 1 (identified by 5′-RACE strategies) contained an A/T-rich motif, AATAAA, 23 nucleotides upstream from the first exon and was assumed to be an inverted TATA promoter (Fig. 3). Other genes expressed by bone cells such as RANKL (18Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Google Scholar), bone sialoprotein (19Kim R.H. Shapiro H.S. Li J.J.

Both genes contained six exons, and the positions of three introns are conserved with those for mOCIL (Fig. 2); the intron-exon splice junctions of the mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2genes are shown in Table 1 (middle and lower), respectively. LikemOCIL,mOCILrP2contained an A/T-rich motif, AATATA, 23 nucleotides upstream from the first exon and was assumed to be an inverted TATA promoter, while mOCILrP1 contains a TTAAAA box 22-nucleotides upstream from the first exon (Fig. 3). A TTAAAA box has been demonstrated as a promoter for connexin 26 and glutamate dehydrogenase (23Peng B.L. Zhang X. Zhou M. Zeng Z.Y. Li G.Y. Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 1999; 31: 313-316Google Scholar, 24Kiang D.T. Jin N. Tu Z.J. Lin H.H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 165-171Google Scholar, 25Das A.T. Arnberg A.C. Malingre H. Moerer P. Charles R. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 795-803Google Scholar). mOCILrP1 also contained a putative CAAT box in the 5′-flanking sequence (−70 to −66, from the transcriptional start site). Both mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 demonstrated alternative mRNA splicing. An intra-exonic splice donor site was located within exon 1 of mOCILrP1, and this resulted in a deletion of 112 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 2). An intra-exonic splice donor site in exon 2 of mOCILrP2 results in exclusion of 12 bp, deleting four amino acids (Fig. 1, mOCILrP2 amino acids 36–39) although the reading frame is maintained. The conservation of protein sequence identity and the genomic organization between these proteins implies that mOCIL, mOCILrP1, and mOCILrP2 may result from recent gene duplication. Supporting this proposition was the high nucleotide sequence identity (∼90%) between the three genes, which was confined to exons 2–5 and intervening introns of mOCIL with the corresponding regions (exons 3–6) of mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2. Consistent with the low amino acid identity in the intracellular domains between these family members (Fig. 1), exon 1 of mOCIL shared little nucleotide identity with exons 1 and 2 of either mOCILrP1 or mOCILrP2, mOCILrP1, and mOCILrP2 appeared closest due to their genomic organization and since exon 2 of mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 shared 70% nucleotide identity; exon 1 of mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 shared little identity. Meanwhile intron 1 sequences of mOCIL, mOCILrP1, and mOCILrP2 were not conserved. As we have shown previously, the recombinant extracellular domain of mOCIL inhibits osteoclast formation in cultures of adherent spleen cells treated with soluble RANKL and M-CSF (14Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J. Quinn J.M. McKinstry W.J. Gillespie M.T. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14916-14923Google Scholar). To determine if mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 exert similar biological action as mOCIL, recombinant proteins for mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 fused to maltose-binding protein were prepared. Mouse marrow cells were cultured in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF for 7 days and multinucleate TRAP+ osteoclasts were formed. Recombinant mOCILrP1 and mOCILrP2 dose-dependently inhibited osteoclast formation over a comparable dose range to that observed with mOCIL (Fig. 4), while MBP protein alone had no effect on osteoclast formation even at a dose of 500 ng/ml that provided maximal inhibition of osteoclast formation with MBP-OCIL (Fig. 4). Consistent with our previous findings and a direct role of mOCIL on osteoclast progenitors, osteoclast formation was also inhibited in cultures of adherent spleen cells or T cell-depleted spleen cells incubated with RANKL and M-CSF by treatment of recombinant mOCILrP1 or mOCILrP2 (data not shown). Our previous study of the tissue distribution of OCIL was carried out by immunohistochemistry with antibody raised to a peptide s"

We investigated possible alterations ofMUC2 gene expression by p53 and p21Sdi1/Waf1/Cip1 in a human colon cancer cell line, DLD-1, establishing subclones in which a tetracycline-regulatable promoter controls exogenous p53 and p21 expression. MUC2 mRNA more significantly increased in response to p53 than to p21. Unexpectedly, MUC2 expression was also induced in human osteosarcoma cells, U-2OS and Saos-2, by exogenous p53. We next performed a reporter assay to test the direct regulation ofMUC2 gene expression by p53. Deletion and mutagenesis of the MUC2 promoter region showed that it contains two sites for transactivation by p53. Furthermore, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that p53 binds to those elements. We analyzedMUC2 expression in other cell types possessing a functional p53 after exposure to various forms of stress. In MCF7 breast cancer and A427 lung cancer cells, MUC2 expression was increased along with the endogenous p53 level by actinomycin D, UVC, and x-ray, but not in RERF-LC-MS lung cancer cells carrying a mutated p53. These results suggest that p53 directly activates the MUC2 gene in many cell types.

Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878Google Scholar). p53 protein is a transcription factor and regulates the expression of a number of growth control genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA repair, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature (Lond.). 2000; 408: 307-310Google Scholar, 3Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Google Scholar, 4Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Google Scholar). p53 is also suggested to induce differentiation in human tumor cells (5Takahashi R. Inagaki T. Matsuwari S. Fujioka M. Maeda S. Ijuhin N. Haga H. Koh T.

In such cases, although p21Sdi1/WAF1/Cip1, one of the downstream target genes of p53 (7El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar), might mediate regulation of a cell type-specific phenotype through functional control of cyclin-dependent kinase and retinoblastoma family proteins, p53 would directly regulate tissue-specific genes related to differentiation. Furthermore, it was suggested that p53 regulates production of the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton, and secreted proteins (9Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Google Scholar, 10Kannan K. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Jakob-Hirsch J. Kela I. Kaminski N. Getz G. Domany E. Givol D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2225-2234Google Scholar), although the machinery for the regulation has not yet been identified. Activation of these kinds of genes might be closely related with cellular differentiation and cell type-specific. It is possible that part of the genes regulated by p53 are not always the same among cell types because of differences in components of the transcription machinery, since the degree of differentiation and/or genetic and epigenetic alterations could be different. Therefore, to advance our understanding of the functions of p53, results obtained using different cell types need to be accumulated. Mucins are the major components of mucus, which coats the epithelia of the intestines, airways, and other mucous membrane-containing organs. They are thought to provide a protective, lubricating barrier against particles and infectious agents on mucosal surfaces. MUC2 is one of the major secreted mucins in human large and small intestine (11Tytgat K.M. Buller H.A. Opdam F.J. Kim Y.S. Einerhand A.W. Dekker J.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 749-757Google Scholar). Regulation of MUC2 by p53 and/or p21 has not yet been demonstrated, although the p53 gene is frequently mutated during the development of CRCs as in other cancers (1Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P.

To investigate the biological significance of inactivation of the p53- and RB-signaling pathways, we have established subsets of cell lines in which a tetracycline-regulatable promoter controls the induction of tumor suppressor genes, and we are analyzing phenotypic alterations of cancer cell lines by these genes (18Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Kohno T. Yokota J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 25-30Google Scholar, 19Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Adachi J. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1389-1396Google Scholar, 20Adachi J. Ookawa K. Kohno T. Tomizawa Y. Tsuchida S. Yokota J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 148-155Google Scholar). We applied our system to a colorectal carcinoma cell line and screened alterations in the expression of several genes related to differentiation of the colonic mucosa, including the MUC2 gene. Here, we demonstrate that transcription of the MUC2 gene is directly stimulated by p53 and that the activation occurs not only in colonic epithelial cells but also in other cell types. The human colon cancer cell line DLD-1 and human lung cancer cell line RERF-LC-MS were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resource Bank Cell Bank Center. The human lung cancer cell line A427 and human breast cancer cell line MCF7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. From DLD-1 cells, we established subclones in which a tetracycline-regulatable promoter controls the induction of p53 and p21 in the same manner as described previously (18Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Kohno T. Yokota J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 25-30Google Scholar, 19Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Adachi J. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1389-1396Google Scholar, 20Adachi J. Ookawa K. Kohno T. Tomizawa Y. Tsuchida S. Yokota J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 148-155Google Scholar). Up53-1 and Sp53-3 cells are human osteosarcoma-derived subclones in which a tetracycline-regulatable promoter controls the induction of p53 (18Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Kohno T. Yokota J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 25-30Google Scholar,19Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Adachi J. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1389-1396Google Scholar). These transfectants were maintained in culture medium containing hygromycin B (0.3 mg/ml; Invitrogen) and G418 (0.5 mg/ml; Invitrogen) with 1 μg/ml of tetracycline. Actinomycin D, solubilized in H2O, was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 5 nm. Prior to UVC irradiation, the culture medium was removed, and the cell layer was then irradiated at 12 mJ/cm2 with a Stratalinker (Stratagene) and further cultured in the original conditional medium. X-ray irradiation was performed in the culture medium with 60 grays from an MBR-1505R2 x-ray source (Hitachi Medical Corp.) at a dose rate of 3 grays/min with settings at 5 mA and 150 kV. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer as described elsewhere (19Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Adachi J. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1389-1396Google Scholar). First, 50 μg of cellular protein was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Equal loading of protein was confirmed by staining the membrane after detection. After blocking with 4% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (mAb) PAb1801 (Oncogene Science). The blots were then probed using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of MUC2 protein, 50 μg of cellular protein was separated by 3.5% agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS and 0.375m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and electroblotted to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane without methanol. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with anti-MUC2 antibody (ccp58; BD Pharmingen). The blots were then probed using an ECL PLUS Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated from the cells using a RNeasyTM Total RNA Kit (Qiagen) with DNase I. The RT-PCR was performed in 20 μl of a reaction mixture consisting of 45 nm forward and reverse primers, 1× EZ buffer, 300 μm each dNTP, 2 units of rTth DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.1 μg of template total RNA. The primers for the amplification of MUC2 were 5′-GAC CTC CAG CAC AGT TTT ATC AAC A-3′ and 5′-GCC AGC AAC AAT TGA CAC GTA TCT-3′. The primers forp21were 5′-GTG AGC GAT GGA ACT TCG ACT T-3′ and 5′-GGC GTT TGG AGT GGT AGA AAT C-3′. The primers for β-actin were described previously (21Mikami T. Ookawa K. Shimoyama T. Fukuda S. Saito H. Munakata A. Hashimoto T. Shinkawa H. Suda T. Tsuchida S. Yagihashi S. Uitoo J. Novel Findings of Gene Diagnosis, Regulation of Gene Expression, and Gene Therapy. 1172. Elsevier, Tokyo1999: 153-158Google Scholar). RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The integrity of RT-PCR was confirmed by sequencing a part of the RT-PCR products. For the reporter analysis of the MUC2 promoter, DNA fragments containing MUC2 genomic sequences were amplified from normal human genomic DNA using the PCR and primers based on the DNA sequence of human genomic MUC2 (GenBankTM accession number U67167). The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). Deletion mutants were generated by PCR (22Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Google Scholar). The p53 expression vector was constructed by ligating p53cDNA from pT2p53neo (19Ookawa K. Tsuchida S. Adachi J. Yokota J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1389-1396Google Scholar) into the pCMV3.1+ vector (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using EffectenTM transfection reagent (Qiagen) in the presence of trace amounts of phRL-TK. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and all activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and annealed to produce the following double-strand oligonucleotides: M1 (5′-CTG CCA TCA TGC TGC CGG CAT GTC CCT GGC ATG TTC AGG C-3′) and M2 (5′-TCC GTA ACA TGT CCC CTG GCT GGG CAT GTA CTC CC-3′). Three micrograms of nuclear extract and 0.18 pmol of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl of DNA binding buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 of μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) for 20 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, a 15- or 60-fold excess of the unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction before the labeled oligonucleotide. These competitors were M1 oligonucleotide, M2 oligonucleotide, a p53 consensus oligonucleotide from the humanGADD45 promoter 5′-GTA CAG AAC ATG TCT AAG CAT GCT GGG GAC-3′, and its mutant oligonucleotide 5′-GTA CAG AAT CGC TCT AAG AGC TCT GGG GAC-3′ (23Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Google Scholar). For a supershift assay, 0.25 μg of the monoclonal antibodies PAb1801 and PAb421 (Oncogene Science) and normal mouse IgGs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the reaction mixture at 20 min after starting the incubation, and the mixture was incubated for a further 20 min. Samples were loaded on a native 4% acrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and electrophoresed at 4 °C and 150 V for 90 min. The gel was dried and visualized using the Molecular Analyst phosphorimaging system (Bio-Rad). Cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in six-well plates 36–48 h before fixation and cultured in the presence or absence of 5 nm actinomycin D for 24 h. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 1 min. The coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 8% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 20 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with the anti-MUC2 antibody (ccp58; BD Pharmingen) for 2 h. After a wash with Tris-buffered saline three times, the coverslips were incubated with secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti mouse Ig; Dako) for 1 h. After another wash in Tris-buffered saline, the coverslips were mounted and examined under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). To investigate possible alterations in gene expression related to differentiation of the colonic mucosa by p53 and p21Sdi1/Waf1/Cip1, we established subclones, in which a tetracycline-regulatable promoter controls the induction of p53 and p21, from a human colon cancer cell line, DLD-1, carrying mutatedp53genes (24Rodrigues N.R. Rowan A. Smith M.E. Kerr I.B. Bodmer W.F. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7555-7559Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In Dp53-1 and Dp53-7 cells, exogenous p53 protein was significantly induced by the removal of Tc, the amount produced differing between them, and a slight leakage of expression of the introduced gene was observed. In Dp21-1 cells, the introduced p21gene was induced to express by the withdrawal of Tc, whereas the amount of protein was less than that for p53 induction in Dp53-1 and Dp53-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B,MUC2 mRNA was significantly more increased in response to p53 than to p21, and its elevation was correlated with the amount of p53 protein. In the time course experiment using Dp53-1 cells, induction of exogenous p53 protein was observed from 6 h after the removal of Tc (Fig. 1C). MUC2was also detected at this time point as well as p21, an authentic p53-inducible gene product (Fig. 1D). To test whether the elevation of MUC2 mRNA caused by p53 was specific to the colon cancer cell line, we evaluated the expression in human osteosarcoma cell lines in which a tetracycline-regulatable promoter controls the expression of exogenous p53 (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly,MUC2 gene expression was also increased by p53 in these cells (Fig. 2B). In the time course experiment, Up53-1 cells showed induction of p53 from 3 h after withdrawal of Tc, and thep21 mRNA level was elevated as well, whereas the increase in MUC2 mRNA was delayed and observed from 6 h. On the other hand, in another osteosarcoma cell line, Sp53-3, alterations in p53, MUC2, and p21expression almost paralleled each other and were similar to the colon cancer case. Since the increase in MUC2 mRNA expression was related to the induction of p53 protein, we searched for candidate elements in theMUC2 gene that may interact with p53. This gene was found to possess two sites with convincing homology to the published p53 consensus sequence (25El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Google Scholar) in its 5′ promoter region. One sequence, designated M1, is located 1100 bp and the other sequence, M2, 650 bp upstream of the first exon (Fig. 3A). Both putative p53-binding sites in the MUC2 gene matched the consensus sequence in 18 of 20 bp. Furthermore, one more 10-bp motif, that matched the consensus sequence in 7 of 10 bp, was next to the upstream site at a distance of 1 bp in M1. To investigate the functional significance of these sites, we cloned the 5′ promoter region of the MUC2 gene, comprising two putative p53-binding sites, into pGL3-Basic (WT−1411/+27 construct in Fig. 3B) and compared its response to p53 with that of reporter vectors harboring deletions of these sites (Fig. 3B). The WT−1411/+27 construct showed a 2.7-fold increase of activity due to p53 expression. In contrast, the WT−636/+27 construct, which lacked the sequence from −637 to −1411 of the WT−1411/+27 construct, displayed no remarkable increase in response to p53 (1.1-fold). The Δ−1146/−1097 construct, which had only the proximal p53-binding site (M2), showed little increase of activity (1.2-fold). The Δ−676/−642 construct, which had only the distal site (M1), displayed a 2.0-fold increase. Finally, a slight decrease of activity was observed in the Δ−1146/−1097 Δ−676/−642 construct (0.8-fold), which lacked both M1 and M2 due to a small deletion around each site. To investigate whether p53 could in fact bind to those p53-responsive elements identified in the MUC2 promoter, we performed an EMSA using nuclear extract from Dp53-1 or Sp53-3 cells that were cultured without or with tetracycline for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, two oligonucleotides, M1 and M2, were bound more by the nuclear extracts from p53-induced cells than from uninduced cells. These bindings were competed by an excess of unlabeled M1 or M2, as well as an excess of p53-binding oligonucleotides from the GADD45 gene, but not by the mutated GADD45 sequence (Fig. 4B). The anti-p53 mAb PAb1801 caused a supershift of M1 and M2 complexes efficiently (Fig. 4C, a and c). On the other hand, another anti-p53 mAb PAb421 efficiently supershifted M1 oligonucleotide and enhanced the binding (Fig. 4C,upper panel, b), whereas it appeared to inhibit the binding to M2 oligonucleotide and supershifted what little DNA-binding complex was detected only slightly (Fig. 4C, lower panel, d). These supershift experiments demonstrated the presence of p53 in both complexes. We next determined whetherMUC2 expression was induced by the activation of endogenous p53 through cellular stress such as actinomycin D treatment, UVC, and x-ray irradiation (26Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311Google Scholar, 27Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Google Scholar). In MCF7, in which the p53 gene is a wild type (28Casey G. Lo-Hsueh M. Lopez M.E. Vogelstein B. Stanbridge E.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1791-1797Google Scholar), endogenous p53 protein increased in response to these stresses to different degrees (Fig. 5A). The MUC2 andp21 transcripts were increased along with p53alteration, although relative amounts of MUC2 mRNA were not always correlated with those of p21 (Fig. 5B). In A427, another cell line carrying the wild-type p53 gene (29Lehman T.A. Bennett W.P. Metcalf R.A. Welsh J.A. Ecker J. Modali R.V. Ullrich S. Romano J.W. Appella E. Testa J.R. Gerwin B.I. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4090-4096Google Scholar), endogenous p53 was also increased by stress, and the MUC2transcripts were expressed except in the case of x-ray irradiation.p21 transcripts increased in proportion to p53 protein. On the other hand, in RERF-LC-MS, carrying a mutated p53 gene (30Jia L.Q. Osada M. Ishioka C. Gamo M. Ikawa S. Suzuki T. Shimodaira H. Niitani T. Kudo T. Akiyama M. Kimura N. Matsuo M. Mizusawa H. Tanaka N. Koyama H. Namba M. Kanamaru R. Kuroki T. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 243-253Google Scholar), although p53 protein was detected and its amount changed little,MUC2 mRNA was not detected and not increased by the stresses. Induction of MUC2 expression along with an increase in p53 protein caused by actinomycin D was also observed in other cell lines, U-2OS osteosarcoma and HepG2 hepatoma carrying wild-type p53 (31Diller L. Kassel J. Nelson C.E. Gryka M.A. Litwak G. Gebhardt M. Bressac B. Ozturk M. Baker S.J. Vogelstein B. Friend S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5772-5781Google Scholar, 32Hsu I.C. Tokiwa T. Bennett W. Metcalf R.A. Welsh J.A. Sun T. Harris C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 987-992Google Scholar), but not in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells lacking the suppressor gene (31Diller L. Kassel J. Nelson C.E. Gryka M.A. Litwak G. Gebhardt M. Bressac B. Ozturk M. Baker S.J. Vogelstein B. Friend S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5772-5781Google Scholar) (data not shown). In MCF7 and A427 cells, an increase in endogenous p53 was observed from 3 h after the addition of actinomycin D, with the alteration being more evident in MCF7 than in A427 (Fig. 5C). The enhanced MUC2and p21 expression was well correlated with p53, although the expression of MUC2 was delayed in comparison with that of p21 (Fig. 5D). Induction of MUC2 andp21 expression was not observed in RERF-LC-MS up to 12 h after actinomycin D treatment. To demonstrate the up-regulation of MUC2 protein expression in MCF7 cells caused by an increase in p53 protein following exposure to stress, we performed immunofluorescence analysis, since it is hard to detect MUC2 protein of more than 550 kDa (11Tytgat K.M. Buller H.A. Opdam F.J. Kim Y.S. Einerhand A.W. Dekker J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1352-1363Google Scholar, 12Allen A. Hutton D.A. Pearson J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 797-801Google Scholar) by conventional Western blot analysis. A representative result is shown in Fig. 6. The fluorescence was observed in some cells at 24 h after actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 6a) but not in the nontreated MCF7 cells (Fig. 6c). In positive cells, fine granules were detected in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region (Fig. 6e). A similar positive result was obtained in A427 cells after actinomycin D treatment but not in RERF-LC-MS cells (data not shown). To further confirm the increase of MUC2 protein, we carried out Western blot analysis by using an agarose gel instead of the polyacrylamide gel. In MCF7 and A427 cells, a smeary band was observed in the samples treated with actinomycin D, UVC, and x-ray but not in the control (Fig. 7A). In RERF-LC-MS cells, it was never detected (data not shown). The intensity of the smeary band was extremely increased by UVC treatment in MCF7 and was not so much increased by actinomycin D treatment in MCF7 and A427 cells. Finally, the smeary band was also detected in Dp53-1 cells at 12 h after induction of wild-type p53 but not in the absence of wild-type p53 (Fig. 7B). In this study, we demonstrated that MUC2expression was increased along with the induction of exogenous wild-type p53 in some carcinoma cell lines. There are two putative p53-binding sites in the promoter region of the MUC2 gene. Our results showed that each of them contributed to stimulation of the promoter activity of the MUC2 gene. EMSA has revealed that p53 binds to those p53-responsive elements. Interestingly, in EMSA using mAbs, the binding of p53 to the distal element was enhanced by PAb421, whereas that to the proximal element was reduced. Although the difference would be partly due to the length and/or number of 10-bp motifs, our result was similar to the case for the p21 gene (33Resnick-Silverman L. St Clair S. Maurer M. Zhao K. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2102-2107Google Scholar). However, the increase in MUC2 expression did not always parallel that of p21 in the cell lines examined. To date, many genes have been reported to be regulated by p53, and the time course of mRNA expression differs among them (9Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Google Scholar, 34Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature (Lond.). 1997; 389: 300-305Google Scholar). This would be due to differences in the stability of the mRNA and in the context of the p53-binding sequence in the regulatory region. Moreover, indirect effects of p53 might play an important role. Recently, it was suggested that modification of the p53 protein such as phosphorylation and/or acetylation determines its transcriptional properties including the selection of target genes (2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature (Lond.). 2000; 408: 307-310Google Scholar, 3Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Google Scholar, 4Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Google Scholar). It would be interesting to study the above issues to explain the differences in the regulation ofMUC2 and p21 by p53 as well as the responses by cell lines. In addition to exogenous p53, MUC2 expression was induced along with the increase in endogenous wild-type p53 after cellular stress. In the immunofluorescence analysis, the staining pattern and the percentage of MUC2-positive cells were consistent with those for colonic goblet cells (13Ho S.B. Niehans G.A. Lyftogt C. Yan P.S. Cherwitz D.L. Gum E.T. Dahiya R. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 641-651Google Scholar, 14Blank M. Klussmann E. Kruger-Krasagakes S. Schmitt-Graff A. Stolte M. Bornhoeft G. Stein H. Xing P.X.

This result supports our findings at the protein level. Overall, an increase in MUC2expression accompanied by induction of wild-type p53 protein was observed in colon, lung, breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and hepatoma cell lines. Although it would not be entirely ruled out that MUC2was induced by indirect effects of p53 or by some other process rather than by the effects of p53 in the case of cellular stress, our results indicate that the MUC2 gene is one of the p53-inducible genes. The MUC2 gene was reported to be regulated by DNA methylation of the promoter region and the Sp family of transcription factors (15Hanski C. Riede E. Gratchev A. Foss H.D. Bohm C. Klussmann E. Hummel M. Mann B. Buhr H.J. Stein H. Kim Y.S. Gum J. Riecken E.O. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 685-695Google Scholar, 36Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 259-267Google Scholar, 37Aslam F. Palumbo L. Augenlicht L.H. Velcich A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 570-576Google Scholar). However, little is known about its regulation by cellular stress. In light of the protective function of mucin, it is possible that cellular stress promotes the construction of a protective barrier around damaged cells by the production of MUC2 via p53. The physical barrier constructed by MUC2 would be readily permeable to ions and low molecular weight solutes but obstructive to larger molecules such as damaging proteases. Therefore, the barrier would not be effective against cellular stress but would protect the surroundings from damaged cells. Several clinical studies have been performed on MUC2 expression. In CRCs, it was reported that there was an inverse association between the immunoreactivity of MUC2 and alteration of p53 (16Manne U. Weiss H.L. Grizzle W.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4017-4025Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to nonmucinous CRCs, in mucinous carcinomas, MUC2 was expressed at relatively high levels, but alterations of p53 were not so frequently detected (38Campo E. de la Calle-Martin O. Miquel R. Palacin A. Romero M. Fabregat V. Vives J. Cardesa A. Yague J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4436-4442Google Scholar). These correlations between MUC2 and p53 in CRCs would be partly due to the regulation of the MUC2 gene by p53. On the other hand, it was shown that detection of MUC2 expression was a favorable prognostic indicator in gastric carcinomas, intrahepatic bile duct tumors, and pancreas tumors (39Baldus S.E. Zirbes T.K. Engel S. Hanisch F.G. Monig S.P. Lorenzen J. Glossmann J. Fromm S. Thiele J. Pichlmaier H. Dienes H.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 79: 133-138Google Scholar, 40Utsunomiya T. Yonezawa S.

Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1347-1355Google Scholar). Although MUC2 was suggested to be involved in the suppression of tumor formation in mice (43Velcich A. Yang W. Heyer J. Fragale A. Nicholas C. Viani S. Kucherlapati R. Lipkin M. Yang K. Augenlicht L. Science. 2002; 295: 1726-1729Google Scholar), in those cases, tumors with MUC2 expression might retain wild-type p53. In conclusion, our results showed that MUC2 expression is transcriptionally regulated by p53 protein in several cell lines. MUC2 protein contains more than 5100 amino acid residues and has a complex structure with heavy glycosylation (12Allen A. Hutton D.A. Pearson J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 797-801Google Scholar, 44Kim Y.S. Gum Jr., J. Brockhausen I. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 693-707Google Scholar, 45Van Klinken B.J. Einerhand A.W. Buller H.A. Dekker J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 103-116Google Scholar). Therefore, it is difficult to study by conventional techniques. The biological function of MUC2 protein remains to be clarified. It would be interesting to determine whether MUC2 contributes to the survival of damaged cells and/or surrounding cells and to clarify the mechanisms of another biological function that was recently suggested by Velcich et al. (43Velcich A. Yang W. Heyer J. Fragale A. Nicholas C. Viani S. Kucherlapati R. Lipkin M. Yang K. Augenlicht L. Science. 2002; 295: 1726-1729Google Scholar). Further investigation is necessary to reveal the biological significance of the stimulation of the MUC2 gene by p53."
https://openalex.org/W2068147729,"Kinases of the Jak family (Jak1/2/3 and Tyk2) interact with the membrane proximal domain of different cytokine receptors and play a critical role in the activation of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways. In this report we demonstrate that both the Box 1 and Box 2 motif collaborate in the association and activation of Jak1 by type I interferons. Mutational analysis of the β chain of type I interferon receptor (IFNαRβL/IFNAR2) revealed that Box 1 plays a more significant role in activation than in the association with Jak1. On the contrary, the Box 2 motif contributes more to the association with Jak1 than to kinase activation. Additionally, the study of the Jak1 binding sites on the IL2 receptor β (IL2Rβ), IFNγRα/IFNGR1, and IL10Rα/IL10R1 chains suggests that cytokine receptors have two different kinds of interaction with Jak1. One form of interaction involves the Box 1 and the previously described Box 2 motif, which we now designate as Box 2A, characterized by the VEVI and LEVL sequences present in IFNαRβL/IFNAR2 and IL2Rβ subunits, respectively. The second form of interaction requires a motif termed Box 2B, which is present in the IFNγRα/IFNGR1 (SILLPKS) and IL10Rα/IL10R1 (SVLLFKK) chains. Interestingly, Box 2B localizes close to the membrane region (8–10 amino acids from the membrane) similar to Box 1, whereas Box 2A is more distal (38–58 amino acids from the membrane). Kinases of the Jak family (Jak1/2/3 and Tyk2) interact with the membrane proximal domain of different cytokine receptors and play a critical role in the activation of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways. In this report we demonstrate that both the Box 1 and Box 2 motif collaborate in the association and activation of Jak1 by type I interferons.

The interaction between a given receptor and Jak is not specific, because the same Jak can associate with and be activated by different receptors. However, the absence of a distinct Jak cannot be compensated by another Jak as has been demonstrated by the cytokine-specific phenotypes observed in animals with targeted disruptions of these kinases (4Rodig S.J.

The membrane proximal region of cytokine receptors that interact with Jak2 contains a highly conserved motif termed Box 1 (see Fig. 1E), which is formed by a proline-rich sequence located 6–10 amino acids after the transmembrane domain (11Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1788-1795Google Scholar, 12Hackett R.H. Wang Y.-D. Sweitzer S. Feldman G. Wood W.I. Larner A.C. J. Biol.

The consensus sequence for the Box 1 motif present in single-subunit cytokine receptors can be described as follows: φφPX(I/V)PXP(E/K) (φ = hydrophobic residues). It is also important to point out that a region within the cytoplasmic domain C-terminal from Box 1 contains a second motif, Box 2, which is not so well defined. The amino acid sequence more frequently found in the Box 2 motif is (V/L)E(V/L)L represented by φEφφ (see also Fig. 1E). The Box 2 motif is also present in single-chain cytokine receptors and is required in some cases for full activation of Jak2 (14Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Google Scholar).Interestingly, the binding sites for Jak1, Jak3, and Tyk2 are not so well defined. The Tyk2 binding site on the α chain of IFNαR (or IFNAR1) has only distant homology with other cytokine receptors (15Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cel.

Jak1 is activated by IFNs (IFNα/β and IFNγ) and several cytokines, including the IL6 (IL6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M) and IL2 families (IL2, IL4, IL7, IL9, and IL15) (17Stahl N.

Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Google Scholar). The Jak1 binding site has been studied for a few cytokine receptors and appears to be rather heterogeneous. For example, the sequence 266LPKS269 of the α chain of IFNγR (or IFNGR1), which has at best distant similarity to Box 1, revealed that only Pro267 was important for Jak1 binding (19Kaplan D.H. Greenlund A.C. Tanner J.W. Shaw A.S. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9-12Google Scholar). In the case of the IL2Rβ chain, a sequence with some similarity to Box 1 and Box 2 appear to be important for Jak1 binding (26Zhu M.-h. Berry J.A. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10719-10725Google Scholar). Mutations of the Box 2 motif in gp130 and IL2Rβ chains affect not only binding but also activity (26Zhu M.-h. Berry J.A. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10719-10725Google Scholar, 27Narazaki M. Witthuhn B.A. Yoshida K. Silveinnoinen O. Yasukawa K. Ihle J.N. Kishimoto Y. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In comparison, initial studies of the Box 1 of the IFNαRβL (or IFNAR2) chain suggested that this motif by itself has a minimum contribution to Jak1 binding (21Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Fish E. Kellum M. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26388-26393Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Box 1 and Box 2 motifs of IFNαRβL are separated by only 7 amino acids, whereas the distance between these two motifs in the IL2Rβ and gp130 is 38 and 31 residues, respectively. Although some of the cytokine receptor subunits that activate Jak1 have Box 1 and/or Box 2 motifs (i.e. gp130, IL2Rβ, and IFNαRβL), others such as the IL10Rα, and possibly the IFNγRα, do not have easily definable Box 1 or Box 2 motifs. This variability in the Jak1 binding sites of cytokine receptors also appears to be accompanied by differences on the corresponding receptor binding surfaces of Jak1 (29Usacheva A. Kotenko S. Witte M.M. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1302-1308Google Scholar). Although all cytokine receptors require the JH7 and part of the JH6 domains of Jak1 for activation, distinct cytokine receptors interact with a second region of Jak1 that is receptor-specific. For example, the second area of interaction for the IL10Rα is JH3, whereas IL2Rβ and IL4Rα interact with JH4 and JH5–6, respectively (29Usacheva A. Kotenko S. Witte M.M. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1302-1308Google Scholar).This variability in the Jak1 binding site among cytokine receptors suggests that Jak1 could interact with different motifs in distinct cytokine receptors. This type of model would be important to develop therapeutic agents that may block Jak1 binding and/or function within the context of some cytokine systems without disturbing Jak1 activation by others. In this report, we sought to address whether there are differences in Jak1 binding sites among cytokine receptors. We characterized the kinase binding domain for two different types of receptors that activate Jak1: (a) receptors such as the IFNαRβL and IL2Rβ that contain Box 1 and Box 2 motifs and (b) receptors that do not have either Box 1 or Box 2 motifs (i.e. IFNγRα and IL10α). Although in the case of the IFNαRβL, Box 2 appears to contribute to the majority of Jak1 binding, its mutation did not affect Jak1 activation by IFNα. Surprisingly, some mutations of Box 1 such as Pro289 and Pro291 affected Jak1 binding and activation, whereas other alterations such as the addition of a Pro in position 292 (N292P) or the inversion of Box 1 of IFNαRβL did not affect Jak1 binding but impaired Jak1 activation. The Box 2 motif of the IL2Rβ was also critical for binding to Jak1, whereas Box 1 cannot interact with Jak1 in the absence of Box 2.Interestingly, IL10Rα and IFNγRα, which do not contain either Box 1 or Box 2 motifs, associate with Jak1 through a different motif that is localized closer to the transmembrane region. Thus, these data suggest that Jak1 interacts with cytokine receptors in two different manners. One form of interaction involves both Box 1 and Box 2A motifs (i.e. IL2Rβ and IFNαRβL chains). The Box 2A motif, previously described as Box 2, is represented by a sequence formed by hydrophobic, charged, hydrophobic, and hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. VEVI or LEVL). The second form of interaction, found in the IL10Rα and IFNγRα/IFNGR1 chains, involves Box 2B, a motif that is different from Box1 and Box 2A.DISCUSSIONLigand-induced dimerization of receptor subunits brings Jak kinases into proximity allowing resting or low activity kinases to become fully activated. This probably occurs through transphosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop. Therefore, the position of the kinases on cytokine receptor chains may be critical to allow the proper conformation after receptor dimerization. The Box 1 motif is a proline-rich motif (33O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-Y. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 309-312Google Scholar) in a hydrophobic context present in most cytokine receptor chains that interact with Jak2. This motif is invariably positioned 6–12 residues from the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1E). The Box 1 motif on single-subunit cytokine receptors (i.e. GH-R, EPOR, and PRL-R) (Fig. 1) consists of two hydrophobic amino acids, proline #1, any amino acid, a valine or isoleucine, proline #2, any amino acid, proline #3, and a charged residue. In the case of multichain cytokine receptors that interact with Jak2 such as IL3Rα, IL5Rα, GMCSFR, and IFNγRβ/IFNGR2, proline #3 may not be present (see Fig. 1, granulocyte-macrophace colony stimulating factor receptor, IL3Rα, and IFNγRβ).The interaction between Jak1 and cytokine receptor subunits does not appear to be so well defined. In most cases, the Box 1 motif is not as conserved (i.e. IL2Rβ and IL4Rα; see Fig. 1E,Box 1) or not present (i.e. IL10Rα). In the case of the IFNγRα chain, analysis of a region proximal to the membrane (∼15 residues) revealed that only mutation of Pro267, within a motif with little homology to Box 1, affects Jak1 binding and activation. In contrast, the initial mapping of the Jak1 binding site on the IFNαRβL chain revealed that a region more distal from the membrane was more important for Jak1 binding than the Box 1 motif (21Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Fish E. Kellum M. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26388-26393Google Scholar). These differences led us to question whether the interaction between cytokine receptors and Jak1 follows different rules than those for the association between single subunit receptors and Jak2.Interaction between Jak1 and IFNαRβL or IL2RβThe Box 1 and Box2 motifs of the IFNαRβL chain, unlike in the IL2Rβ, are very close to each other and probably contribute to the formation of the binding site. It is likely that the Box 2 motif has the largest area of contact with Jak1, because GST fusion proteins that do not contain the Box 1 motif bind Jak1 almost as efficiently as wild type (21Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Fish E. Kellum M. Platanias L.C. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26388-26393Google Scholar). However, the contribution of Box 1 to the formation of the Jak1 binding site is demonstrated by the finding that mutations of Pro289 or Pro291 decreases the interaction with this kinase even in the presence of Box 2. However, even though both motifs collaborate in Jak1 binding, Box 1 appears to be more important for the regulation of kinase activity. This is supported by the finding that kinase activation was affected even by mutations of Box 1 that did not affect Jak1 binding.The Box 2 motifs in IL2Rβ and IFNαRβL are very similar, and Ala mutations of either motif appear to have equivalent effects on Jak1 binding. Moreover, the use of GST fusion proteins that contain only Box 1 revealed that neither Box 1 of IL2Rβ nor IFNαRβL could bind substantial amounts of Jak1 by itself. However, unlike IL2Rβ (26Zhu M.-h. Berry J.A. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10719-10725Google Scholar,28Goldsmith M.A. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14698-14704Google Scholar), mutations of Box 2 of IFNαRβL did not affect Jak1 activation. It is possible that the distance separating the Box 1 and Box 2 motifs in these receptors (7 and 38 residues for IFNαRβL and IL2Rβ, respectively) results in a different type of interaction with Jak1. This type of model is supported by the finding that slightly different regions of Jak1 are required to associate with the IFNαRβL and IL2Rβ chains (29Usacheva A. Kotenko S. Witte M.M. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1302-1308Google Scholar).IFNγRα and IL10Rα Use a Different Jak1 Binding MotifUnlike IFNαRβL and IL2Rβ, IFNγRα and IL10Rα do not have an identifiable Box 1 or Box 2 motif. This prompted us to further characterize the interaction between Jak1 and these receptors. Our results indicate that the IL10Rα has a Jak1 binding site close to the transmembrane region that has some degree of similarity with IFNγRα. Moreover, mutation of Phe272 of IL10Rα, which is the equivalent to Pro267 in IFNαRγ, significantly decreased the interaction with Jak1. Altogether, these data suggest that there are at least two different types of interactions between Jak1 and cytokine receptors. First, cytokine receptors such as IL2Rβ and IFNαRβL interact with Jak1 through the Box 1 and Box 2 motifs that we will call Box 2A characterized by a hydrophobic-charged-hydrophobic-hydrophobic sequence. The Box 1 in these receptors is slightly different from Box 1 present in single subunit receptors that activate Jak2 (see Fig. 1E). Second, other cytokine receptors such as IL10Rα and IFNγRα use a different motif that is close to the membrane that we will call Box 2B. The Box 2B motif is characterized by a core of 4 hydrophobic residues flanked by a Ser and charged residues. However, mapping of the regions of Jak1 involved in the interaction with cytokine receptors strongly suggest that a region different from the Box 2B motif of the IL10Rα also interacts with Jak1 (29Usacheva A. Kotenko S. Witte M.M. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1302-1308Google Scholar). In the case of IFNγRα, a GST fusion protein, encoding the entire cytoplasmic domain except Box 2B, failed to interact with Jak1. These data suggest that Box 2B, at least in IFNγRα, should be sufficient to sustain Jak1 binding and probably activation.Contrary to what was observed with the interaction between Jak2 and Box 1, the position of the Jak1 binding domain within the cytoplasmic region of cytokine receptors was more variable. This raises the hypothesis that the positioning of the kinase within the cytoplasmic domain may be important for correct kinase alignment after receptor dimerization, which would allow transphosphorylation of the tyrosines in the activation loop. In single subunit receptors, ligand binding results in homodimerization and, therefore, Jak2 is always at the same position in both members of the dimer. However, in heterodimeric receptors, positioning may be more critical. In this scenario, the Jak1 binding site in IFNγRα is closer to the membrane to produce a correct alignment with Jak2, which also interacts with a binding site on the IFNγRβ chain that is close to the membrane. This suggests that the proximal Jak1 binding site on IFNγRα evolved to pair the Jak2 site present in IFNγRβ. The Tyk2 (34Yan H. Piazza F. Krishnan K. Pine R. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4046-4051Google Scholar) and Jak1 binding sites on the α and βL chains of IFNαR are also at similar distances from the membrane (32 and 38 amino acids, respectively). This model would predict that the Tyk2 binding site on the IL10Rβ (CRFB4) (35Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol.

EMBO. 1997; 19: 5894-5903Google Scholar) should be proximal to the membrane to match the membrane proximal Jak1 site present on the IL10Rα chain. It should be considered that what we refer as “distance from the membrane” is only a relative measurement, because we do not know the secondary and tertiary structure of the cytoplasmic domain of these receptors. The finding that dimerization of the EPOR per se is not enough for activation may support the role of kinase orientation or stereo conformation in receptor activation (37Livnah O. Johnson D.L. Stura E.A. Farrell F.X. Barbone F.P. You Y. Liu K.D. Goldsmith M.A. He W. Krause C.D. Pestka S. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 993-1004Google Scholar).

The consensus sequence for the Box 1 motif present in single-subunit cytokine receptors can be described as follows: φφPX(I/V)PXP(E/K) (φ = hydrophobic residues). It is also important to point out that a region within the cytoplasmic domain C-terminal from Box 1 contains a second motif, Box 2, which is not so well defined. The amino acid sequence more frequently found in the Box 2 motif is (V/L)E(V/L)L represented by φEφφ (see also Fig. 1E). The Box 2 motif is also present in single-chain cytokine receptors and is required in some cases for full activation of Jak2 (14Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding sites for Jak1, Jak3, and Tyk2 are not so well defined. The Tyk2 binding site on the α chain of IFNαR (or IFNAR1) has only distant homology with other cytokine receptors (15Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cel.

Jak1 is activated by IFNs (IFNα/β and IFNγ) and several cytokines, including the IL6 (IL6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M) and IL2 families (IL2, IL4, IL7, IL9, and IL15) (17Stahl N.

The Jak1 binding site has been studied for a few cytokine receptors and appears to be rather heterogeneous. For example, the sequence 266LPKS269 of the α chain of IFNγR (or IFNGR1), which has at best distant similarity to Box 1, revealed that only Pro267 was important for Jak1 binding (19Kaplan D.H. Greenlund A.C. Tanner J.W. Shaw A.S. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9-12Google Scholar). In the case of the IL2Rβ chain, a sequence with some similarity to Box 1 and Box 2 appear to be important for Jak1 binding (26Zhu M.-h. Berry J.A. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10719-10725Google Scholar). Mutations of the Box 2 motif in gp130 and IL2Rβ chains affect not only binding but also activity (26Zhu M.-h. Berry J.A. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. J.

In comparison, initial studies of the Box 1 of the IFNαRβL (or IFNAR2) chain suggested that this motif by itself has a minimum contribution to Jak1 binding (21Domanski P. Nadeau O.W. Fish E.

Interestingly, the Box 1 and Box 2 motifs of IFNαRβL are separated by only 7 amino acids, whereas the distance between these two motifs in the IL2Rβ and gp130 is 38 and 31 residues, respectively.

It shares this structure with its closest relative, Tih1, an even smaller protein, which is broadly expressed and not regulated by imprinting (2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The PH domain is a ∼100-amino acid module defined by sequence homology, which has a conserved tertiary structure of a β-sandwich of 3 + 4 stranded β sheets with variable intervening loops, followed by a single amphipathic α helix (3Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar). Most PH domain-containing proteins can bind to certain phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids (PIPs), but their binding affinities for the specific products of phosphoinositide metabolism vary greatly (4Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For example, the PH domains from phospholipase C δ1 (PLCδ1) bind strongly to PtdIns(4,5)P2, but not to the downstream metabolites of this compound, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, which are produced by the action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Other PH domains, typified by that of the general receptor for phosphoinositides (GRP1), show the opposite pattern of binding affinity, with high affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and only low affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. Based on in vitro and in vivo assays, Kavran et al. (5Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) classified PH domains into two groups: a small class of PH domains with high affinity and specificity for particular PIPs and a much larger class showing low affinity promiscuous binding to various PIPs. More recently, Maffucci and Falasca (6Maffucci T. Falasca M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have proposed a further division of PH domains into three groups. In this scheme, Group 1 proteins are those with high affinities for specific PIPs; Group 2 proteins have lower but still measurable affinity for phosphoinositides, and show less ability to discriminate among the various PIPs; and Group 3 proteins have minimal affinity for phosphoinositides, with no detectable specificity.Consistent with their varying interactions with phosphoinositides, and with their occurrence alongside a variety of other modules, PH domains have diverse functions. Among these are roles in signal transduction downstream of membrane receptors, control of membrane vesicle trafficking in the cell, targeting of phospholipid-modifying enzymes to cellular membranes, and control of cytoskeleton-membrane interactions (3Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These functions are unified by the ability of PH domains to associate with the plasma membrane and/or intracellular membranes through their high or low affinity binding to phosphoinositide lipids. Certain PH domains can also mediate protein-protein interactions, for example that which occurs between the beta-adrenergic receptor protein kinase and the βγ subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (8Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). But the protein-binding site is distant from the phosphoinositide binding region, and a PH domain-phosphoinositide interaction may be simultaneously required for physiological function (9Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Interactions of PH domains with phosphoinositides have been examinedin vitro and in vivo by several complementary approaches. These include direct binding of GST-PH domain fusion proteins to phosphoinositides in lipid vesicles or immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes (5Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J.

A third assay tests the ability of the PH domain of interest, fused to activated mutant Ras (Ras*), to rescue Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are defective in the Ras pathway due to a temperature-sensitive (ts) CDC25 mutation (26Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Because yeast do not make PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent rescue can be separately evaluated, by co-transformation with active versus inactive constructs of the catalytic subunit of PI3K.As a first step in assessing the biochemical functions of Ipl and Tih1, we have used each of these approaches to compare the behavior of the PH domains from these proteins with several other PH domains. We have also carried out sequence comparisons with other PH domains. The data indicate that Ipl and Tih1 define an outlying phylogenetic branch of the PH domain superfamily, but that they are bona fide PIP binders, which fit best into the group with moderate affinity and poor selectivity for the known phosphoinositide lipids.DISCUSSIONThe Ipl gene was originally found in a chromosomal walk, which was undertaken to identify and characterize novel imprinted genes in a megabase-scale imprinted domain on human Chr11p15.5 and distal mouse Chr7 (35Qian N. Frank D. O'Keefe D. Dao D. Zhao L. Yuan L. Wang Q. Keating M. Walsh C. Tycko B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2021-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Since then, substantial information has accrued concerning the tissue-specific expression and functional imprinting of this gene, and the creation of Ipl-knockout mice has established that at least one of its functions is to regulate the growth of the placenta (1Frank D. Fortino W. Clark L. Musalo R. Wang W. Saxena A. Li C.M. Reik W. Ludwig T. Tycko B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7490-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Biochemical information is needed to explain this genetic finding, and a starting point is provided by the domain structure of the Ipl protein. This structure, which is shared by the closest Ipl homologue, Tih1, is remarkably simple, consisting of a single predicted PH domain with short N- and C-terminal extensions. The results shown here verify that this central region acts as a bona fide PH domain, which is capable of interacting with phosphoinositide lipids, both in direct binding assays and in membrane translocation assays, as well as functionally in a yeast growth rescue assay. Overall, the findings suggest that the Ipl and Tih1 PH domains bind to known PIPs with moderate affinity and low specificity. Whether this promiscuous binding reflects the true physiological targets of proteins in this group is not known, and they may have a high affinity for a yet unidentified lipid, or even protein, ligand. For example, recent work has shown that the tagged PH domain of human oxysterol binding protein accumulates at the yeast Golgi apparatus partly in response to the presence of PtdIns(4)P and partly in response to an unidentified factor that is dependent on the Golgi ATPase Arf1p (36Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).As summarized in Table I, our data also show clear differences in the behavior of the Ipl versus Tih1 PH domains. Consistent with these differences, Ipl and Tih1 have different patterns of tissue-specific expression (2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and no detectable growth abnormality was found in Tih1-null concepti (2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ipl protein is highly conserved in vertebrate evolution, presumably reflecting a conserved biological function, but we have not been able to identify Tih1 orthologues in non-mammalian vertebrates.Further progress in understanding the biochemical functions of Ipl and Tih1 will depend on localizing the native proteins within the cell at high resolution and on identifying any proteins or other lipids with which they interact. For most PH domain-containing proteins, such protein-protein interactions do not occur via the PH domain, but instead involve different modules elsewhere in the protein. For example, Lnk associates with the ABP-280 actin binding protein via an interdomain stretch of 56 amino acids between its PH and SH2 domains (37He X. Li Y. Schembri-King J. Jakes S. Hayashi J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), several GRB family proteins bind to cytoplasmic domains of growth factor receptors via their SH2 domains (38Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and Gab1 binds to PI3K and intracellular domains of some growth factor receptors via phosphorylated tyrosine residues outside of its PH domain (39Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Neither Ipl nor Tih1 show clear evidence for protein-protein binding motifs, except possibly for proline-containing sequences near their C termini. Additional work will be required to determine whether their short C- or N-terminal extensions, or their PH domains, are able to mediate protein-protein interactions. An alternative possibility, which is suggested by the lack of additional functional modules in the small Ipl and Tih1 proteins, is that these proteins may act as natural “dominant-negatives” to dampen some biological processes by binding to PIPs and thereby excluding PIP binding “effector” proteins. The Ipl gene (also known as Tssc3) is highly expressed in the placenta, where its effective dosage is regulated by parental imprinting.

It shares this structure with its closest relative, Tih1, an even smaller protein, which is broadly expressed and not regulated by imprinting (2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The PH domain is a ∼100-amino acid module defined by sequence homology, which has a conserved tertiary structure of a β-sandwich of 3 + 4 stranded β sheets with variable intervening loops, followed by a single amphipathic α helix (3Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar). Most PH domain-containing proteins can bind to certain phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids (PIPs), but their binding affinities for the specific products of phosphoinositide metabolism vary greatly (4Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For example, the PH domains from phospholipase C δ1 (PLCδ1) bind strongly to PtdIns(4,5)P2, but not to the downstream metabolites of this compound, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, which are produced by the action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Other PH domains, typified by that of the general receptor for phosphoinositides (GRP1), show the opposite pattern of binding affinity, with high affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and only low affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2. Based on in vitro and in vivo assays, Kavran et al. (5Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) classified PH domains into two groups: a small class of PH domains with high affinity and specificity for particular PIPs and a much larger class showing low affinity promiscuous binding to various PIPs. More recently, Maffucci and Falasca (6Maffucci T. Falasca M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have proposed a further division of PH domains into three groups. In this scheme, Group 1 proteins are those with high affinities for specific PIPs; Group 2 proteins have lower but still measurable affinity for phosphoinositides, and show less ability to discriminate among the various PIPs; and Group 3 proteins have minimal affinity for phosphoinositides, with no detectable specificity. Consistent with their varying interactions with phosphoinositides, and with their occurrence alongside a variety of other modules, PH domains have diverse functions. Among these are roles in signal transduction downstream of membrane receptors, control of membrane vesicle trafficking in the cell, targeting of phospholipid-modifying enzymes to cellular membranes, and control of cytoskeleton-membrane interactions (3Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These functions are unified by the ability of PH domains to associate with the plasma membrane and/or intracellular membranes through their high or low affinity binding to phosphoinositide lipids. Certain PH domains can also mediate protein-protein interactions, for example that which occurs between the beta-adrenergic receptor protein kinase and the βγ subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (8Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). But the protein-binding site is distant from the phosphoinositide binding region, and a PH domain-phosphoinositide interaction may be simultaneously required for physiological function (9Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Interactions of PH domains with phosphoinositides have been examinedin vitro and in vivo by several complementary approaches. These include direct binding of GST-PH domain fusion proteins to phosphoinositides in lipid vesicles or immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes (5Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J.

A third assay tests the ability of the PH domain of interest, fused to activated mutant Ras (Ras*), to rescue Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are defective in the Ras pathway due to a temperature-sensitive (ts) CDC25 mutation (26Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Because yeast do not make PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent rescue can be separately evaluated, by co-transformation with active versus inactive constructs of the catalytic subunit of PI3K. As a first step in assessing the biochemical functions of Ipl and Tih1, we have used each of these approaches to compare the behavior of the PH domains from these proteins with several other PH domains. We have also carried out sequence comparisons with other PH domains. The data indicate that Ipl and Tih1 define an outlying phylogenetic branch of the PH domain superfamily, but that they are bona fide PIP binders, which fit best into the group with moderate affinity and poor selectivity for the known phosphoinositide lipids. DISCUSSIONThe Ipl gene was originally found in a chromosomal walk, which was undertaken to identify and characterize novel imprinted genes in a megabase-scale imprinted domain on human Chr11p15.5 and distal mouse Chr7 (35Qian N.

Since then, substantial information has accrued concerning the tissue-specific expression and functional imprinting of this gene, and the creation of Ipl-knockout mice has established that at least one of its functions is to regulate the growth of the placenta (1Frank D. Fortino W. Clark L. Musalo R. Wang W. Saxena A. Li C.M. Reik W. Ludwig T. Tycko B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7490-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Biochemical information is needed to explain this genetic finding, and a starting point is provided by the domain structure of the Ipl protein. This structure, which is shared by the closest Ipl homologue, Tih1, is remarkably simple, consisting of a single predicted PH domain with short N- and C-terminal extensions. The results shown here verify that this central region acts as a bona fide PH domain, which is capable of interacting with phosphoinositide lipids, both in direct binding assays and in membrane translocation assays, as well as functionally in a yeast growth rescue assay. Overall, the findings suggest that the Ipl and Tih1 PH domains bind to known PIPs with moderate affinity and low specificity. Whether this promiscuous binding reflects the true physiological targets of proteins in this group is not known, and they may have a high affinity for a yet unidentified lipid, or even protein, ligand. For example, recent work has shown that the tagged PH domain of human oxysterol binding protein accumulates at the yeast Golgi apparatus partly in response to the presence of PtdIns(4)P and partly in response to an unidentified factor that is dependent on the Golgi ATPase Arf1p (36Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).As summarized in Table I, our data also show clear differences in the behavior of the Ipl versus Tih1 PH domains. Consistent with these differences, Ipl and Tih1 have different patterns of tissue-specific expression (2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and no detectable growth abnormality was found in Tih1-null concepti (2Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ipl protein is highly conserved in vertebrate evolution, presumably reflecting a conserved biological function, but we have not been able to identify Tih1 orthologues in non-mammalian vertebrates.Further progress in understanding the biochemical functions of Ipl and Tih1 will depend on localizing the native proteins within the cell at high resolution and on identifying any proteins or other lipids with which they interact. For most PH domain-containing proteins, such protein-protein interactions do not occur via the PH domain, but instead involve different modules elsewhere in the protein. For example, Lnk associates with the ABP-280 actin binding protein via an interdomain stretch of 56 amino acids between its PH and SH2 domains (37He X. Li Y. Schembri-King J. Jakes S. Hayashi J. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), several GRB family proteins bind to cytoplasmic domains of growth factor receptors via their SH2 domains (38Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and Gab1 binds to PI3K and intracellular domains of some growth factor receptors via phosphorylated tyrosine residues outside of its PH domain (39Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Neither Ipl nor Tih1 show clear evidence for protein-protein binding motifs, except possibly for proline-containing sequences near their C termini. Additional work will be required to determine whether their short C- or N-terminal extensions, or their PH domains, are able to mediate protein-protein interactions. An alternative possibility, which is suggested by the lack of additional functional modules in the small Ipl and Tih1 proteins, is that these proteins may act as natural “dominant-negatives” to dampen some biological processes by binding to PIPs and thereby excluding PIP binding “effector” proteins.

Together, these findings implicate a role for the IGF-II/MPR in a host of cellular pathways due to its lectin activity.Both of the MPRs are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing four structural/functional components: an N-terminal signal sequence, an extracytoplasmic region that harbors the ligand-binding site(s), a transmembrane region, and a C-terminal cytosolic tail (Fig.1). The ∼46-kDa bovine CD-MPR, which exists as a stable dimer in membranes, contains a single extracytoplasmic domain per monomer polypeptide that is composed of 154 amino acids and binds to a single molecule of Man-6-P (18Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1987; 50: 181-192Google Scholar, 19Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11458-11467Google Scholar, 20Hoflack B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Structural and biochemical analyses of a truncated, soluble form of the CD-MPR have demonstrated that its extracytoplasmic domain alone can fold into a high affinity carbohydrate-recognition domain (19Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11458-11467Google Scholar, 22Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Google Scholar, 23Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M.

The ∼300-kDa IGF-II/MPR, on the other hand, appears to exist predominantly as a monomer within the cell, although weak dimeric complexes have been observed in membranes that are stabilized by the binding of multivalent ligands (25Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Google Scholar, 26Thibault C. Chan J.K. Perdue J.F. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol.

The large 2269-residue extracytoplasmic region of the bovine IGF-II/MPR is composed of 15 domains that display amino acid identity (14–38%), similar size (∼147 residues) and cysteine distribution to each other and to the CD-MPR, giving rise to the prediction that they exhibit similar disulfide bonding and tertiary structures (30Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2233-2237Google Scholar, 31Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Google Scholar). These observations also led to the early suggestion that perhaps each of the 15 extracytoplasmic domains of the IGF-II/MPR folds into a functional carbohydrate-recognition domain (31Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Google Scholar). However, equilibrium dialysis experiments demonstrated that the IGF-II/MPR binds only two moles of Man-6-P per mole of receptor (32Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Google Scholar), and the two distinct carbohydrate-binding sites of the IGF-II/MPR were localized to domains 1–3 and domains 7–9 of its extracytoplasmic region by partial proteolysis experiments and expression of truncated forms of the receptor (33Westlund B. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23233-23239Google Scholar, 34Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Google Scholar).Until recently, very little was known about the molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition by the MPRs. The three-dimensional structures of the extracytoplasmic region of the CD-MPR bound to Man-6-P (22Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Google Scholar) or to pentamannosyl phosphate (23Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Google Scholar) not only revealed the molecular basis of Man-6-P recognition by the CD-MPR but also provided further insights into carbohydrate recognition by the IGF-II/MPR: a CD-MPR structure-based sequence alignment predicted several amino acids in domains 3 and 9 to be in the N- and C-terminal Man-6-P binding pockets of the IGF-II/MPR (22Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed to test these predictions, identifying four residues (Gln-392, Ser-431, Glu-460, and Tyr-465) in domain 3 and four residues (Gln-1292, His-1329, Glu-1354, and Tyr-1360) in domain 9 that were essential for carbohydrate recognition by the IGF-II/MPR in addition to the previously identified Arg-435 (domain 3) and Arg-1334 (domain 9) residues (34Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Google Scholar, 35Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Google Scholar). Together these studies provided strong evidence that the two Man-6-P binding sites of the IGF-II/MPR are structurally related to each other and to the CD-MPR and utilize a similar carbohydrate-recognition mechanism.The identification of residues essential for phosphomannosyl recognition in domains 3 and 9 is consistent with the observation that the best sequence alignment occurs between the CD-MPR and extracytoplasmic domains 3 and 9 of the IGF-II/MPR (31Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Google Scholar). To date, however, the two binding sites of the IGF-II/MPR have each been localized to a minimum of three domains, 1–3 and 7–9 (Fig. 1), respectively, leading to the prediction that residues in adjacent domains are important either directly for ligand binding or for proper folding of the carbohydrate-recognition domains (33Westlund B. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23233-23239Google Scholar, 34Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the observation of Waheed et al., who performed tryptic digestion on the human IGF-II/MPR and identified four fragments of molecular size (15–27 kDa) consistent with a single extracytoplasmic domain that were functional in Man-6-P recognition (36Waheed A. Braulke T. Junghans U. von Figura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 1248-1254Google Scholar), suggests the possibility that a single domain (i.e.domain 3 and/or domain 9) of the IGF-II/MPR is sufficient for carbohydrate recognition. In this report we have tested this hypothesis by generating constructs encoding either domain 3 alone or domain 9 alone of the extracytoplasmic region of the IGF-II/MPR and assayed their ability to recognize several carbohydrate ligands, including Man-6-P, pentamannosyl phosphate, the lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, and the carbohydrate modifications, mannose 6-sulfate (Man-6-S) and Man-6-P methyl ester (Man-6-P-OCH3), found on the oligosaccharides of lysosomal enzymes isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum.DISCUSSIONIn addition to its role in delivering lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes, the multifunctional nature of the IGF-II/MPR has become increasingly apparent as the list of extracellular ligands recognized by this receptor has grown to include a diverse spectrum of glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins that are involved in a multitude of cellular processes, including apoptosis, viral entry and transmission between cells, and cellular differentiation and proliferation (3Dahms N.M. Hancock M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 317-340Google Scholar). These findings have prompted detailed structure/function analyses of the extracytoplasmic region of this receptor in order to understand how the IGF-II/MPR recognizes its various target proteins. Previous proteolysis experiments and expression of truncated IGF-II/MPR constructs have determined that the binding site for the nonglycosylated polypeptide hormone, IGF-II, is bipartite: the primary binding determinants reside within the N-terminal portion of extracytoplasmic domain 11 whereas sequence elements within domain 13 contribute an ∼5- to10-fold enhancement to the binding affinity of the receptor for IGF-II (Fig. 1) (53Dahms N.M.

The crystal structure of domain 11 of the human IGF-II/MPR (60Brown J. Esnouf R.M. Jones M.A. Linnell J. Harlos K. Hassan A.B. Jones E.Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1054-1062Google Scholar) has been reported recently and used to propose a putative IGF-II binding pocket composed of mostly hydrophobic residues, including Ile-1572, a residue that when mutated to threonine abolishes IGF-II binding to the receptor. Furthermore, the Ile-1572 → Thr mutation is associated with loss of heterozygosity of the IGF-II/MPR gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (56Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Google Scholar, 61Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Byrd J.C. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4314-4319Google Scholar). In contrast, each of the two Man-6-P binding pockets of the IGF-II/MPR are predicted to consist of a lattice of hydrogen bond and ionic interactions similar to that observed in the structures of the CD-MPR bound to Man-6-P (22Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Google Scholar) or to pentamannosyl phosphate (23Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, site-directed mutagenesis screens have identified five residues (Gln-392, Ser-431, Arg-435, Glu-460, and Tyr-465) in domain 3 and five residues (Gln-1292, His-1329, Arg-1334, Glu-1354, and Tyr-1360) in domain 9 that are essential for carbohydrate recognition by the IGF-II/MPR (34Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Google Scholar, 35Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Google Scholar, 37Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Google Scholar). However, the two Man-6-P binding sites of the IGF-II/MPR have only been mapped to a minimum of three domains, 1–3 and 7–9 (Fig. 1) (33Westlund B. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23233-23239Google Scholar, 34Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Google Scholar), and no structural information is yet available for any of these domains. Furthermore, whereas it has been shown that domain 11 alone is sufficient for binding to IGF-II (57Grimme S. Honing S. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33697-33703Google Scholar, 60Brown J. Esnouf R.M. Jones M.A. Linnell J. Harlos K. Hassan A.B. Jones E.Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1054-1062Google Scholar), it is not known whether domain 3 or domain 9 alone is sufficient for carbohydrate recognition by the IGF-II/MPR or whether additional domains (i.e. domains 1 and 2 or domains 7 and 8) are necessary. To begin to address these issues, a P. pastoris expression system was used to generate truncated, soluble forms of the IGF-II/MPR composed of either domain 3 (Dom3His) or domain 9 (Dom9His) alone followed by a tag of six histidine residues, and the carbohydrate binding and dissociation properties of these constructs were examined.Pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography experiments clearly showed that Dom9His is capable of Man-6-P binding. (Fig.3 B). The ability of the Dom9His construct to bind to β-glucuronidase with an affinity (K d = 0.3 ± 0.1 nm, Fig. 7 B) similar to that previously reported for the Dom7–9His construct (K d = 0.5 ± 0.1 nm) (35Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Google Scholar), the Dom7–11 construct (K d = 0.6 nm) (37Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Google Scholar), and the full-length IGF-II/MPR (K d = 2 nm) (52Fischer H.D. Gonzalez-Noriega A. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5069-5074Google Scholar), further demonstrated that extracytoplasmic domain 9 alone can fold into a high affinity carbohydrate recognition. Moreover, Dom9His was functionally equivalent in all aspects tested to the previously characterized IGF-II/MPR C-terminal Man-6-P binding site constructs, Dom7–9 and Dom7–11 (37Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Google Scholar). Dom9His was readily eluted with low pH buffer from a pentamannosyl phosphate column (Fig. 3 C), and the observed pH profile of binding to β-glucuronidase (Fig. 4 B) confirmed its ability to undergo acid-dependent dissociation in solution. Consistent with our recent demonstration that the C-terminal Man-6-P binding site of the IGF-II/MPR is highly specific for Man-6-P, Dom9His bound poorly to a column composed ofD. discoideum lysosomal enzymes (Fig. 5), which are modified with Man-6-S and Man-6-P-OCH3 groups rather than the phosphomonoester, Man-6-P. Quantitative inhibition studies confirmed these results: Dom9His exhibited ∼280- to 335-fold lower affinities toward Man-6-P-OCH3 (K i = 6.5 mm) and Man-6-S (K i = 7.7 mm) than for Man-6-P (K i = 23 μm, Fig. 6). Together, these results indicate that domains 7 and 8 are not necessary components of the C-terminal Man-6-P binding site of the IGF-II/MPR; rather, the amino acid determinants of high binding affinity and Man-6-P specificity reside entirely within domain 9.Dom3His exhibited a pH profile of binding to β-glucuronidase similar to the previously characterized N-terminal carbohydrate binding site construct, Dom1–3His (37Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Google Scholar), demonstrating that domain 3 alone is sufficient for ligand binding and acid-dependent dissociation (Fig. 4 A). However, no binding of Dom3His could be detected by pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 3 A) nor did Dom3His bind to an affinity column containing D. discoideum lysosomal enzymes (Fig. 5), leading to the prediction that its ligand-binding affinity was dramatically lower than that of the Dom1–3His construct. Binding affinity analyses confirmed this prediction, demonstrating that Dom3His has an ∼1000-fold lower affinity (K d ∼ 500 nm, Fig. 7 A) for the lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, than the previously characterized Dom1–3His construct (K d = 0.5 ± 0.1 nm) (35Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that despite its dramatically lower affinity toward β-glucuronidase as compared with Dom1–3His, the Dom3His construct still exhibits a binding affinity that is significantly higher than that of many other lectins, such as C-type lectins, galectins (S-type), and siglecs (I-type) that generally exhibit binding affinities in the 100 μm–1 mm range (62Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 543-551Google Scholar).Several possible explanations could account for the inability of the Dom3His construct to maintain the high affinity interactions that are observed in constructs encompassing a minimum of domains 1–3 of the extracytoplasmic region of the IGF-II/MPR. Because proteins expressed in P. pastoris often contain oligosaccharides that are significantly longer than the glycans generated in higher eukaryotes, we considered the possibility that the glycans modifying Dom3His might be sterically interfering with ligand binding. Enzymatic deglycosylation of Dom3His, however, failed to restore high affinity binding ability (data not shown). A second possibility is that extra residues at the N terminus of the Dom3His could be juxtaposed near the binding pocket, providing an inhibitory influence on its binding ability. Of note, there are eight residues (Cys-His-Arg-Asp-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Ser-Arg-Ser-Cys) in the linker region between the last cysteine residue of domain 2 and the first cysteine of domain 3. A corresponding set of eight linker residues (Cys-Pro-Val-Val-Arg-Ala-Glu-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Cys) is found between the last cysteine of domain 8 and the first cysteine of domain 9. In accordance with previous IGF-II/MPR constructs (i.e.Dom5–9 (34Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Google Scholar) and Dom7–9 (37Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Google Scholar)) that have been generated in our laboratory that maintain high affinity carbohydrate binding, we elected to begin the Dom3His and Dom9His constructs with the second linker residue such that each polypeptide contained seven of the eight linker residues at its N terminus. Furthermore, N-terminal sequencing revealed that Dom3His contains four additional amino acids (Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala) remaining from the cleavage site of the S. cerevisiaeα-factor signal sequence, bringing the total to eleven residues preceding the first cysteine of domain 3. Although the Dom9His construct was clearly unaffected by the nine or eleven residues at its N terminus, we cannot rule out the possibility that the length and/or linker sequence differences present at the N terminus of Dom3His could be preventing it from binding to β-glucuronidase with high affinity.On the other hand, it is possible that the addition of a tag of six histidine residues to the C terminus of the Dom3His construct is somehow adversely influencing ligand binding, although this seems rather unlikely based on the observation that the addition of a His6-tag to the C terminus of the previously characterized Dom1–3His construct had no detectable effect on its affinity toward β-glucuronidase (35Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Google Scholar). To test this possibility, Dom1–3 and Dom3 constructs without a C-terminal His6-tag were generated inP. pastoris and tested for Man-6-P binding ability. Whereas the Dom1–3 construct was functional by pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography, the Dom3 construct exhibited no detectable binding to the column as observed for the Dom3His construct (data not shown). Together these data suggest that domains 1 and/or 2 are necessary for high affinity Man-6-P binding by the N-terminal IGF-II/MPR carbohydrate-recognition site. Analogous to the bipartite nature of the IGF-II binding site, residues in domains 1 and/or 2 may provide additional ligand binding contacts or indirectly facilitate proper folding of the binding pocket to enhance the binding affinity of the N-terminal carbohydrate-recognition site. If proven, this would constitute a dramatic structural/functional difference between the two Man-6-P binding sites of the IGF-II/MPR in addition to the recently described specificity differences (37Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Google Scholar). Future structural and biochemical studies will be needed to distinguish among these possibilities to determine the minimal elements required for high affinity binding by the N-terminal carbohydrate-recognition site of the IGF-II/MPR.The ability to generate truncated, soluble forms of the MPRs, as outlined in this report and previously (24Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Google Scholar, 35Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Sun G. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11255-11264Google Scholar, 63Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Google Scholar), that retain the binding affinity and specificity properties of the native receptors opens the way for many potential MPR-based applications. Several features, including its small size (deglycosylated form is ∼17 kDa), high degree of Man-6-P specificity, its μm affinity for Man-6-P, its nm binding affinity for the lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, and its broad pH range of ligand binding (>50% binding of β-glucuronidase observed between pH ∼5.5 and pH ∼8.3), render the IGF-II/MPR domain 9-alone construct an especially suitable reagent. For example, it could be useful for the detection and purification of mannose 6-phosphorylated proteins of interest, including lysosomal enzymes for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders. Alternatively, Dom9His could be used as a tag to facilitate simple, one-step affinity purification of fusion proteins containing this high affinity carbohydrate-recognition domain. This novel IGF-II/MPR derivative could also serve as a high affinity protein inhibitor of the MPRs, with potential applications in the treatment of fibrotic disorders, wound healing, inflammation, cancer, and herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viral infections due to MPR interactions with Man-6-P-containing proteins involved in these processes.In summary, the results of the current study demonstrate the ability of domain 9 alone of the IGF-II/MPR to fold into a high affinity (K d = 0.3 nm) carbohydrate-recognition site and suggest that although the primary binding determinants of the N-terminal Man-6-P binding site reside in domain 3, residues in adjacent domains (domains 1 and/or 2) are important, directly or indirectly, for the generation of a high affinity carbohydrate-binding site. Together these findings, in conjunction with the previous assignment of the IGF-II binding site to domains 11 and 13, prompt the question as to what is the function of the other domains of the IGF-II/MPR. Given the size and number of domains, it is likely that at least some of the other domains also function in ligand binding. Along those lines, the binding site for retinoic acid (64Kang J.X. Li Y.

Our data show that the loss of CD3γ transcripts begins very early after infection and accumulates to a >90% deficiency before a significant effect on surface receptor density is apparent. Blocking TCR·CD3-directed NFAT activation with cyclosporin A provokes a partial re-expression of CD3γ gene transcripts and surface complexes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We have identified three NFAT consensus sequences (5′-GGAAA-3′) in the 5′-upstream region of the human CD3γ gene at: −124 to −120 (NFATγ1), −384 to −380 (NFATγ2), and +450 to +454 (NFATγ3) from the first transcription initiation site. Using electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, we show that NFATc2 alone binds to the NFATγ2 motif; however, complexes containing either NFATc2 or NFATc1 plus NF-κB p50 bind to the NFATγ1 and NFATγ3 sites. We further demonstrate that NFATc1 and NF-κB p50 bind in the same protein·DNA complex and that a fourth Ala added to the core sequence (5′-GGAAAA-3′) in NFATγ1, and NFATγ3 is critical for their binding. Finally, we have shown that an increase in the binding of nuclear NFATc2, NFATc1, and NF-κB p50 to these three motifs is correlated with a progressive loss of CD3γ transcripts after HIV-1 infection.

The quantity of TCR·CD3 complexes present on the surface at any given time is a result of the balance between receptor internalization, leading to intracellular degradation or recycling to the surface, coupled with the synthesis, processing, and exportation of newly formed receptors (reviewed in Ref. 5Alcover A. Alarcon B. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 325-346Google Scholar). It is currently thought that two pathways regulate antigen-induced TCR·CD3 down-regulation from the cell surface: phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the cytoplasmic tails of CD3ζ, CD3γ, CD3δ, and CD3ε (6Luton F. Buferne M. Davoust J. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 63-72Google Scholar, 7D'Oro U. Vacchio M.S. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D.

A recent study has shown that the di-leucine motif in CD3γ increases ligand-induced receptor internalization and degradation 3- to 10-fold, indicating that this chain plays a major role in TCR·CD3 down-modulation (10von Essen M.

Defects in TCR·CD3 surface expression and function are increasingly being reported in an expanding range of clinical conditions, including both peripheral blood and tumor-infiltrating T cells in a wide variety of cancer patients (reviewed in Refs. 11Zier K.

We have demonstrated that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 (15Willard-Gallo K.E. Van de Keere F. Kettmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6713-6717Google Scholar, 16Willard-Gallo K.E.

Virol. 1999; 73: 5207-5213Google Scholar)) infection of the human IL-2-dependent CD4+ T cell line, WE17/10, progressively abrogates TCR·CD3 function and surface expression by specifically interfering with transcription of the CD3γ gene. Our data have shown that, when intracellular conditions favor expression of the viral regulatory genes tat and/or nef in the absence ofrev, CD3γ mRNA and TCR·CD3 surface density are down-regulated and TCR·CD3-mediated immune activities are diminished (26Willard-Gallo K.E. Furtado M. Burny A. Wolinsky S.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 969-979Google Scholar). Nef is a multifaceted viral regulatory protein that is capable of a variety of different, independent functions, some of which have been linked with TCR·CD3-controlled events. It has been shown to directly associate with CD3ζ and lead to its down-modulation from the cell surface (27Howe A.Y. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9827-9834Google Scholar, 28Schaefer T.M. Bell I. Fallert B.A. Reinhart T.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3273-3283Google Scholar). Nef has also been shown to play a role in the post-transcriptional down-modulation of CD4 via a di-leucine motif in this receptor's membrane proximal cytoplasmic domain (29Garcia J.V. Miller A.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 508-511Google Scholar). This CD4 domain is strikingly similar to the di-leucine motif in CD3γ (10von Essen M. Menne C. Nielsen B.L. Lauritsen J.P. Dietrich J. Andersen P.S. Karjalainen K. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4519-4523Google Scholar,30Craig H.M. Pandori M.W. Guatelli J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1992; 255: 79-82Google Scholar) and thus conditions favoring Nef expression could potentially enhance the activity of the CD3γ di-leucine motif. The viral transcriptional transactivator protein Tat is also thought to play an important role in the immune suppression observed after infection by activating and suppressing the expression of a variety of cellular immune response genes (33Buonaguro L.

The transcriptional control elements for CD3γ have remained elusive (the 5′-upstream region of this gene lacks a typical TATA or CAAT box), despite the identification of promoter and enhancer sequences for the other TCR·CD3 genes: TCRα (38Luria S.

However, the recurring defect inCD3γ gene transcripts observed after infection with a wide variety of HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates suggests that transcription of this cellular gene might be controlled by a mechanism similar to the virus. The primary function of HIV-1 Tat is to promote transcription by recruiting a kinase complex known as TAK (Tat-associated kinase) to the transactivation response RNA element present at the 5′-ends of all nascent HIV-1 transcripts and subsequently act in concert with cellular transcription factors bound to the long terminal repeat (LTR) (reviewed in Refs. 50Garber M.E. Jones K.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 460-465Google Scholar and 51Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7791-7796Google Scholar). Among the many regulatory elements in the HIV-1 LTR, there are two adjacent NF-κB binding sites that have been shown to be a major cis-acting element for viral gene expression (52Pereira L.A. Bentley K. Peeters A. Churchill M.J. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 663-668Google Scholar). The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors (p50, p65, RelB, c-Rel, and p52) are induced in response to T cell activation signals to bind to the NF-κB consensus sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) (53Chytil M. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 91-100Google Scholar) and activate viral transcription (54Gerondakis S. Grumont R. Rourke I. Grossmann M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 353-359Google Scholar). Members of the NFAT family of transcription factors (NFATc1 (NFATc, NFAT2); NFATc2 (NFATp, NFAT1); NFATc3 (NFATx, NFAT4); NFATc4 (NFAT3); and NFATc5 (TonEBP); approved UCL/HGNC/HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature) share a common architecture with the NF-κB/Rel family and bind to a five-nucleotide core sequence (5′-GGAAA-3′), which, in addition to being found alone (55Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Google Scholar), is also contained within each NF-κB consensus sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′). The promoter-enhancer regions of several activation-associated genes, some of which have been shown to be activated or suppressed after HIV-1 infection, possess NFAT binding sites, including those encoding IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as cell surface receptors such as FasL and CD40L (reviewed in Ref. 56Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Google Scholar)). Several groups have investigated the potential role of NFAT in HIV-1 replication and the interaction between Tat and NFAT and concluded that the NFAT family of proteins may have distinct effects on HIV-1 replication. NFATc2 is thought to negatively regulate the LTR by competing with the NF-κB for its binding sites, whereas NFATc1 has been shown to positively regulate HIV-1 LTR through the NF-κB binding sites (55Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that virally induced immune suppression may be due to the interaction of Tat with several transcription factors, including Oct, Sp1, and NFAT (57Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Google Scholar, 58Macian F. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3645-3653Google Scholar) as well as through indirect effects on the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and AP-1 (59Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer P.H. Droge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper show that very early after HIV-1 infection in an IL-2-dependent T cell line, the majority (>90%) of CD3γ transcripts are lost, and this occurs before significant TCR·CD3 down-modulation from the surface is apparent. Furthermore, treatment with the immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporin A (CsA), which acts by blocking translocation of NFAT proteins to the nucleus, partially reverses this CD3γ transcription defect. We located three NFAT binding motifs (5′-GGAAA-3′) in the 5′-upstream region of the CD3γ gene (NFATγ1, NFATγ2, and NFATγ3) and found that increased nuclear translocation and binding of NFAT family proteins to these three sites parallels the loss ofCD3γ gene transcripts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) show that the NFATγ1 and NFATγ3 motifs bind complexes containing either NFATc2 or NFATc1 plus NF-κB p50, whereas the NFATγ2 motif binds NFATc2 containing complexes only. The WE17/10 cell line is a human interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent CD4+T cell line (15Willard-Gallo K.E. Van de Keere F. Kettmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The human B lymphocyte line, Raji, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. WE17/10 cells were treated for 18 h with the calcium channel blockers EGTA (2.5 m) and BAPTA/AM (1–10 μm, bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), the PKC activator PMA (30 ng/ml, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), the calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin (30 ng/ml), and the protein kinase inhibitors herbimycin A (10−8m) and staurosporine (1–30 ng/ml). Cells were also treated with the immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporin A (0.1–1.0 μg/ml, CsA) for 1–7 days or stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody (1–10 μg/ml) for 2–3 days. HIV-1-infected TCR·CD3− cells were pretreated for 1 h with CsA followed by overnight stimulation with PMA+Iono (in the continuous presence of CsA) to achieve the maximum potential induction of NFAT translocation to the nucleus in the presence of the inhibitor. Cells were analyzed for CD3 surface expression by flow cytometry as previously described (26Willard-Gallo K.E. Furtado M. Burny A. Wolinsky S.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 969-979Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with the murine monoclonal antibody OKT.3 (directed to CD3ε) in a two-step process (using 1 μg/ml of antibody to ensure saturation binding) followed by the manufacturer's recommended dilution of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (BD Biosciences, Erembodegen, Belgium). The labeled cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescence was analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 2 × 107 cells according to a modified version of the method described by Osborn (63Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Google Scholar). All buffers contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium) to minimize proteolysis. The cellular pellet was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended twice with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl). Cells were collected by centrifugation (600 × g for 10 min), resuspended, and incubated for 10 min with 40 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer A containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (this step was repeated twice). The pellet (nuclear fraction) was incubated with 30 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer C (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) for 20 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear supernatants were diluted with 150 μl of buffer D (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) and stored frozen at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (64Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described by Van Lint et al. (65Van Lint C. Ghysdael J. Paras P.J. Burny A. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2632-2648Google Scholar) with some modifications. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol,Amersham Biosciences, AT Roosendal, Netherlands) using T4-polynucleotide kinase, annealed, isolated on a polyacrylamide gel, and extracted from the gel using the QIAXE II kit (Westburg, AE Leusden, Netherlands) prior to their use in EMSA experiments. Nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were preincubated for 10 min in a reaction mixture containing 10 μg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium), 1.5 μg of the nonspecific competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 50 μmZnCl2, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. 15,000 cpm of the 32P-labeled probe was subsequently added, and the mixture (final volume, 20 μl) was incubated for a further 20 min at room temperature before being loaded onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (1× Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer, migrated at 50 V overnight). The radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography on Biomax MR film (AmershamBiosciences). Oligonucleotides encoding wild type and mutated NFAT binding motifs in the 5′-upstream region of the humanCD3γ gene were as follows: 5′-TCCTTAACGGAAAAACAAAA-3′ (NFATγ1wt), 5′-TCCTTAACCCTTAAACAAAA-3′ (NFATγ1mut), 5′-TCCTTAACGGAAAGACAAAA-3′ (NFATγ1mut1), 5′-TCCTTAACGGAAAGCCAAAA-3′ (NFATγ1mut2), 5′-TCCTTAACGGAAAACCAAAA-3′ (NFATγ1mut3), 5′-TCCTTAATGGAAAAACAAAA-3′ (NFATγ1mut4), 5′-GAGGTGGCTTTCCATTTGGA-3′, (NFATγ2wt), 5′-GAGGTGGCTAAGGATTTGGA-3′ (NFATγ2mut), 5′-GAGGTGGTTTTCCATTTGGA-3′ (NFATγ2mut1), 5′-GAGGTGTTTTTCCATTTGGA-3′ (NFATγ2mut2), 5′-GAGGTGTCTTTCCATTTGGA-3′ (NFATγ2mut3), 5′-GAGGTGGCTTTCCGTTTGGA-3′ (NFATγ2mut4), 5′-AAAGGAAAAAGTATATGTTC-3′ (NFATγ3wt), and 5′-AAAGGAAAGAGTATATGTTC-3′ (NFATγ3mut1). Oligonucleotides encoding wild type and mutated NFAT binding sites in the human IL-2 promoter were: 5′-AGAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTT-3′ (NFAT-IL-2wt), 5′-AGAAAGGACCTTAAACTGTT-3′ (NFAT-IL-2mut). Oligonucleotides encoding the wild type and mutated NF-κB consensus sequence (Santa Cruz, Boechout, Belgium) were: 5′-TTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (NF-κBwt) and 5′-TTGAGCTCACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (NF-κBmut). The oligonucleotide for the Oct-1 binding site (Santa Cruz) was: 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAG-3′. Antibodies directed to the NFAT family proteins NFATc1 (SC-7294X) and NFATc2 (SC-7295X), the NF-κB family proteins p50 (SC-1190X), p65 (SC-109X), c-Rel (SC-6955X), Rel-B (SC-226X), and p52 (SC-7386X), and the AP-1 family proteins c-Jun (SC-1694X) and c-Fos (SC-52) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 1 h on ice prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe for the supershift assay. In the super-supershift and double-supershift assays, the first antibody was preincubated with the nuclear extract for 45 min on ice followed by a subsequent incubation with the second antibody for an additional 45 min on ice before a final 20-min incubation with the radiolabeled probe at room temperature. Total cellular RNA was extracted from 5 × 106 cells using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega Benelux, AJ Leiden, Netherlands) following the manufacturer's recommendations and employing the optimal DNase treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA. The primers used to specifically amplify the CD3γ and CD3δ genes have been previously described (66Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445Google Scholar, 67Long H. Gaffney P. Mortari F. Miller J.S. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 1402-1408Google Scholar). Forward (F) and reverse (R) primer pairs are as follows: CD3γF(5′-CATTGCTTTGATTCTGGGAACTGAATAGGAGGA-3′) andCD3γR (5′-GGCTGCTCCACGCTTTTGCCGGAGACAGAG-3′), which yield a 647-bp product, and CD3δF(5′-TTCCGGTACCTGTGAGTCAGC-3′) and CD3δR(5′-GGTACAGTTGGTAATGGCTGC-3′), which yield a 660-bp product. Five micrograms of total RNA from uninfected and HIV-1-infected WE17/10 cells at various stages of TCR·CD3 down-modulation was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in the presence of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (2.5 units/μl; Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium), 0.5 mm of each dNTP, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 30 pmol of the forward primers forCD3γ or CD3δ, 0.01 mdithiothreitol, 20 μl of 5× first-strand buffer (250 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 2.5% Tween 20 (v/v), pH 8.3) in a total volume of 100 μl. The RT mix was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and 42 °C for 45 min. An internal standard for use in the competitive RT-PCR assay was constructed from a full-length cDNA sequence of the humanCD3γ gene subcloned from pJ6T3γ-2 (68Krissansen G.W. Owen M.J. Verbi W. Crumpton M.J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1799-1808Google Scholar) into theEcoRI site of pUC18 (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium), and the resulting plasmid was called pUC18γ. This recombinant plasmid was then used to construct a competitor by cutting a 1071-bpXhoI fragment from pV344 (69Van den B.A. Cleuter Y. Chen G. Portetelle D. Mammerickx M. Zagury D. Fouchard M. Coulombel L. Kettmann R. Burny A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9263-9267Google Scholar) and ligating it intoXhoI-digested pUC18γ, producing the plasmid pUC18γc. The competitor copy number was calculated using the concentration measured by absorbance at 260 nm and the molecular weight of pUC18γc (i.e. 1 mol of the full-length pUC18γc DNA is equal to 4557 bp × 700 Da (the average molecular mass of a deoxynucleotide base pair) = 3.1899 × 106). Human CD3γ gene expression was measured in a quantitative competitive RT-PCR assay, where the target cDNA was co-amplified with the same stock dilution series of the pUC18γc competitor in all experiments. For each target sequence, 20 sequential dilutions of the pUC18γc competitor DNA (from a minimum of 3.3 × 103to a maximum of 6.6 × 109 copies) were co-amplified with 100 ng of cDNA, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (AmershamBiosciences), 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.4 μm of each primer, 15 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 50 μl in Taq DNA polymerase buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Amplification of CD3γ was performed with an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of amplification: 10 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 35 s, annealing at 50 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 65 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s with a 1-s/cycle automatic prolongation of the extension period. Amplification of CD3δ was performed with an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 94 °C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 58 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. After amplification, the samples were incubated at 72 °C for 7 min, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and stained for 10 min with a freshly prepared ethidium bromide solution (0.5 μg/ml). Our previous work, using dot and Northern blot hybridization analyses, suggested that the specific loss of CD3γ transcripts after HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection does not parallel the down-regulation of TCR·CD3 complexes from the surface at a ratio of 1:1 (15Willard-Gallo K.E.

J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5207-5213Google Scholar). To better define the relationship between the number of CD3γ gene transcripts and the density of TCR·CD3 complexes on the cell surface, we used quantitative competitive RT-PCR to examine transcript levels in uninfected and HIV-1-infected WE17/10 cells. RNA was extracted from cells at different stages in the progression from TCR·CD3hi → TCR·CD3lo → TCR·CD3− (previously described in Ref. 16Willard-Gallo K.E. Delmelle-Wibaut C. Segura-Zapata I.

Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 715-725Google Scholar; in this report the uninfected cells designated as 100% TCR·CD3+are all TCR·CD3hi; whereas, the HIV-1-infected cells described as 90% TCR·CD3+ (for example) are 10% TCR·CD3− and 90% TCR·CD3lo). cDNAs, reverse-transcribed from the native RNA preparation, were co-amplified with serial dilutions of a competitor specific for the humanCD3γ gene (pUC18γc), which had been engineered to produce a larger PCR product (Fig. 1,upper band) than the cellular CD3γ RNA (Fig. 1,lower band). Representative results comparing the relative amounts of RT-PCR products from uninfected and HIV-1-infected cells expressing various levels of TCR·CD3 surface receptors are shown in Fig. 1 A. In the uninfected 100% TCR·CD3+ cells, the competitor was initially detected when 3.3 × 106 molecules were added to the reaction mixture, followed by a corresponding decrease in native CD3γ transcripts until they are no longer detectable in the presence of >6.6 × 108 molecules of the competitor. The competitor was detected earlier (at 6.6 × 105 molecules) in RNA amplified from 100% TCR·CD3+ HIV-1-infected cells (the mean fluorescence revealed that these cells were actually 100% TCR·CD3lowith a receptor density equal to 85% of the uninfected control cells analyzed in parallel; data not shown) and indicated that these TCR·CD3lo cells had already lost ±80% of theirCD3γ gene"

Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is structurally equivalent to the entire molecule of many other G protein-coupled receptors (14Probst W. Snyder L. Schuster D. Brosius J. Sealfon S. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Glycoprotein hormones initially bind to the exodomain, and then the resulting hormone/exodomain complex modulates the endodomain (13Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) to generate cAMP and phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) to produce inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol. Therefore, the ternary interactions among the hormone, exodomain, and endodomain are crucial for successful signal generation. However, there is little information on the subject, particularly concerning the FSH receptor. Since the exodomain lacking the endodomain is capable of high affinity hormone binding (5Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol.

Contrary to this view, it has been reported that FSH and human chorionic gonadotropin binding to their cognate receptors is regulated by certain residues of exoloops 2 and 3 of the endodomain (15Ryu K.

These results suggest that the exodomain interacts with the exoloops and modulates them for signal generation. Yet it is unclear whether the hormone complexed with the exodomain also contacts the exoloops.In this study, we set out to investigate whether exoloops interact with the hormone at all. In a step toward this goal, we examined exoloop 3 of FSHR for its involvement in the activation of the two effectors and interaction with FSH. It is the shortest of the three exoloops, consisting of 11 amino acids, and has been implicated in the cAMP signal generation (15Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Tung C. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

Our observations show, for the first time, the interaction of exoloop 3 with FSH, in particular the FSH α subunit, the mode of this interaction, and its role in the AC and PLCβ activation.DISCUSSIONOur results show that the exoloop 3 is crucially, yet differently, involved in hormone binding and induction of cAMP and IP. They show that FSHR exoloop 3 contacts the α subunit of FSH as part of the ternary complex consisting of FSH, the exodomain, and endodomain. Particularly, Leu583 and Ile584 are more important than other amino acids and project from one side of exoloop 3 in opposite directions. Interestingly, the substitutions of the two residues significantly improved the hormone binding, which is due to the loss of the original side chains rather than the introduction of the side chains from the substitutions. For example, all substitutions of Ile584 with Tyr, Pro, Ala, Cys, Ser, Gln, Asp, Glu, and Arg enhanced the hormone binding affinity, as did the deletion of Ile584 as shown by theK dwt/mut ratios in Fig.11 A. To analyze the nature of the effect, the side chain hydrophobicity (27Roseman M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. Second Ed. Freeman, New York1993: 141-142Google Scholar) of substituting amino acids was plotted against the K d values. The plot showed two distinct groups, one consisting of ICAYQPS with a hydrophobicity/K d coefficient of −1.03 and the other of PSEDR with a hydrophobic coefficient of 0.19 (TableII). The first group had a negative hydrophobic effect on the binding affinity, whereas the second had a positive hydrophobic effect, suggesting a complex, specific microenvironment and interaction of the Ile584 side chain. The interaction appears to be partly hydrophobic and may involve other specificity such as stereospecificity.Table IIHydrophobicity/Kd coefficientsSub groupHydrophobicity/K d coefficientLeu583LCQED−0.59FAPYED−0.07Ile584ICAYQPS−1.03PSEDR0.19Lys590FYQEDR−8.10LCAPSEDR−0.87The side chain hydrophobicity of substituting amino acids for Leu583, Ile584, and Lys590 was plotted against the K d values. The hydrophobicity/K d plots of Leu583, Ile584, and Lys590 showed two groups of a linear distribution. The slope of each group was calculated and presented as the hydrophobicity/K d coefficient. Open table in a new tab Substitutions of Pro582 show diverse results, independent of the hydrophobicity of the side chain. On the other hand, substitutions of Lys590 showed two distinct groups (Fig.11 B): the first group of FYQEDR with the most severe hydrophobicity/K d coefficient of −8.1 and the second group of LCAPSEDR with a coefficient of −0.87 (Table II). In the first group, ring groups such as the phenyl and phenolic side chains of Phe and Tyr, respectively, severely impaired the binding affinity, considerably more than any substitutions of Leu583 and Ile584 did. The second group also negatively impacted the binding affinity, but the effects were mild. A striking difference of the two groups is the substitutions with Phe and Leu. The K d value of FSHRK590F was 50 nm in contrast to 7.2 nm for FSHRK590L, raising a question of whether the side chain flexibility and geometry play a role. The deletion of Lys590, thus, likely relieves the constraint and improves the K d value as shown by the deletion mutant.All of the substitutions, except L583Y, diversely impaired the cAMP induction (Fig. 11 C). This adverse impact was seen the least on the substitutions of Pro582. Among the various Leu583 mutants, only L583F and L583Y were capable of inducing cAMP production. This suggests that a hydrophobic side chain larger than a methyl group is necessary at the position, regardless of whether the side chain is aliphatic or aromatic. This is in contrast to the adverse effect of a ring group at Lys590 on the hormone binding, clearly indicating the requirements for distinct groups at Leu583 and Lys590. All other substitutions of Leu583 lead to insignificant cAMP induction. In addition, every substitution of Ile584 and Lys590abolished cAMP, showing the irreplaceable nature of Ile584and Lys590. In particular, the fact that the K590R substitution failed to induce cAMP production raises the question of whether the positive charge of Lys590 is necessary for cAMP induction. The substitutions of Lys590 with Ala, Cys, Phe, Leu, Tyr, and Arg abrogated IP induction, suggesting the irreplaceable role of Lys590 for both IP and cAMP induction. This is in contrast to the differential effects on cAMP and IP induction by Ala substitutions for the exoloop 3 amino acids, Lys580–Lys590.In conclusion, our observations in this study show the interaction of the FSHR exoloop 3 with FSH, specifically the α subunit. This is consistent with the decade-long view that the common α subunit of the glycoprotein hormones is likely to induce the common hormone action, including cAMP induction (26Pierce J.G. Parson T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Leu583 and Ile584 are crucial for this interaction, in different ways. For example, Ile584 appears to be so specific, requiring some flexibility and stereospecificity so that no other amino acids fit into its place. On the other hand, Leu583 is less specific. Substitutions of these residues often enhanced the hormone binding affinity. However, these improvements in the hormone binding were offset by severe impairment of signal generations for cAMP and/or IP. For example, the Phe or Tyr substitution of Leu583 improved the hormone binding and cAMP induction but impaired IP induction. On the other hand, substitutions for Ile584 and Lys590 abolished the cAMP and IP induction. These conflicting effects on the hormone binding and signal generation likely have constrained any further improvements in receptor functions. Our results open the next logical question of whether Leu583, Ile584, and Lys590 interact with the exodomain and/or the hormone. The answers will provide new insights into the mechanisms of hormone binding and signal generation.

Unlike other receptor subfamilies, they comprise two equal halves, an N-terminal extracellular half (exodomain) and a C-terminal membrane-associated half (endodomain) (1McFarland K. Sprengel R.

Commun. 1993; 193: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Receptor activation occurs in the endodomain (13Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is structurally equivalent to the entire molecule of many other G protein-coupled receptors (14Probst W. Snyder L. Schuster D. Brosius J. Sealfon S. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Glycoprotein hormones initially bind to the exodomain, and then the resulting hormone/exodomain complex modulates the endodomain (13Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) to generate cAMP and phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) to produce inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol. Therefore, the ternary interactions among the hormone, exodomain, and endodomain are crucial for successful signal generation. However, there is little information on the subject, particularly concerning the FSH receptor. Since the exodomain lacking the endodomain is capable of high affinity hormone binding (5Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol.

Contrary to this view, it has been reported that FSH and human chorionic gonadotropin binding to their cognate receptors is regulated by certain residues of exoloops 2 and 3 of the endodomain (15Ryu K.

Furthermore, the hinge region of the exodomain interacts with exoloop 2 and modulates cAMP induction (17Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol.

These results suggest that the exodomain interacts with the exoloops and modulates them for signal generation. Yet it is unclear whether the hormone complexed with the exodomain also contacts the exoloops. In this study, we set out to investigate whether exoloops interact with the hormone at all. In a step toward this goal, we examined exoloop 3 of FSHR for its involvement in the activation of the two effectors and interaction with FSH. It is the shortest of the three exoloops, consisting of 11 amino acids, and has been implicated in the cAMP signal generation (15Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Tung C. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

Our observations show, for the first time, the interaction of exoloop 3 with FSH, in particular the FSH α subunit, the mode of this interaction, and its role in the AC and PLCβ activation. DISCUSSIONOur results show that the exoloop 3 is crucially, yet differently, involved in hormone binding and induction of cAMP and IP. They show that FSHR exoloop 3 contacts the α subunit of FSH as part of the ternary complex consisting of FSH, the exodomain, and endodomain. Particularly, Leu583 and Ile584 are more important than other amino acids and project from one side of exoloop 3 in opposite directions. Interestingly, the substitutions of the two residues significantly improved the hormone binding, which is due to the loss of the original side chains rather than the introduction of the side chains from the substitutions. For example, all substitutions of Ile584 with Tyr, Pro, Ala, Cys, Ser, Gln, Asp, Glu, and Arg enhanced the hormone binding affinity, as did the deletion of Ile584 as shown by theK dwt/mut ratios in Fig.11 A. To analyze the nature of the effect, the side chain hydrophobicity (27Roseman M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. Second Ed. Freeman, New York1993: 141-142Google Scholar) of substituting amino acids was plotted against the K d values. The plot showed two distinct groups, one consisting of ICAYQPS with a hydrophobicity/K d coefficient of −1.03 and the other of PSEDR with a hydrophobic coefficient of 0.19 (TableII). The first group had a negative hydrophobic effect on the binding affinity, whereas the second had a positive hydrophobic effect, suggesting a complex, specific microenvironment and interaction of the Ile584 side chain. The interaction appears to be partly hydrophobic and may involve other specificity such as stereospecificity.Table IIHydrophobicity/Kd coefficientsSub groupHydrophobicity/K d coefficientLeu583LCQED−0.59FAPYED−0.07Ile584ICAYQPS−1.03PSEDR0.19Lys590FYQEDR−8.10LCAPSEDR−0.87The side chain hydrophobicity of substituting amino acids for Leu583, Ile584, and Lys590 was plotted against the K d values. The hydrophobicity/K d plots of Leu583, Ile584, and Lys590 showed two groups of a linear distribution. The slope of each group was calculated and presented as the hydrophobicity/K d coefficient. Open table in a new tab Substitutions of Pro582 show diverse results, independent of the hydrophobicity of the side chain. On the other hand, substitutions of Lys590 showed two distinct groups (Fig.11 B): the first group of FYQEDR with the most severe hydrophobicity/K d coefficient of −8.1 and the second group of LCAPSEDR with a coefficient of −0.87 (Table II). In the first group, ring groups such as the phenyl and phenolic side chains of Phe and Tyr, respectively, severely impaired the binding affinity, considerably more than any substitutions of Leu583 and Ile584 did. The second group also negatively impacted the binding affinity, but the effects were mild. A striking difference of the two groups is the substitutions with Phe and Leu. The K d value of FSHRK590F was 50 nm in contrast to 7.2 nm for FSHRK590L, raising a question of whether the side chain flexibility and geometry play a role. The deletion of Lys590, thus, likely relieves the constraint and improves the K d value as shown by the deletion mutant.All of the substitutions, except L583Y, diversely impaired the cAMP induction (Fig. 11 C). This adverse impact was seen the least on the substitutions of Pro582. Among the various Leu583 mutants, only L583F and L583Y were capable of inducing cAMP production. This suggests that a hydrophobic side chain larger than a methyl group is necessary at the position, regardless of whether the side chain is aliphatic or aromatic. This is in contrast to the adverse effect of a ring group at Lys590 on the hormone binding, clearly indicating the requirements for distinct groups at Leu583 and Lys590. All other substitutions of Leu583 lead to insignificant cAMP induction. In addition, every substitution of Ile584 and Lys590abolished cAMP, showing the irreplaceable nature of Ile584and Lys590. In particular, the fact that the K590R substitution failed to induce cAMP production raises the question of whether the positive charge of Lys590 is necessary for cAMP induction. The substitutions of Lys590 with Ala, Cys, Phe, Leu, Tyr, and Arg abrogated IP induction, suggesting the irreplaceable role of Lys590 for both IP and cAMP induction. This is in contrast to the differential effects on cAMP and IP induction by Ala substitutions for the exoloop 3 amino acids, Lys580–Lys590.In conclusion, our observations in this study show the interaction of the FSHR exoloop 3 with FSH, specifically the α subunit. This is consistent with the decade-long view that the common α subunit of the glycoprotein hormones is likely to induce the common hormone action, including cAMP induction (26Pierce J.G. Parson T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Leu583 and Ile584 are crucial for this interaction, in different ways. For example, Ile584 appears to be so specific, requiring some flexibility and stereospecificity so that no other amino acids fit into its place. On the other hand, Leu583 is less specific. Substitutions of these residues often enhanced the hormone binding affinity. However, these improvements in the hormone binding were offset by severe impairment of signal generations for cAMP and/or IP. For example, the Phe or Tyr substitution of Leu583 improved the hormone binding and cAMP induction but impaired IP induction. On the other hand, substitutions for Ile584 and Lys590 abolished the cAMP and IP induction. These conflicting effects on the hormone binding and signal generation likely have constrained any further improvements in receptor functions. Our results open the next logical question of whether Leu583, Ile584, and Lys590 interact with the exodomain and/or the hormone.

To investigate the structural and functional differences between these two TIMPs, the C-terminal domains (C-TIMP-4 and C-TIMP-2) were expressed independently from their N domains and mutations were introduced into the C-terminal tails. Myoglobin was used as a novel recombinant fusion protein partner because spectroscopic measurement of the heme Soret absorbance at 408 nm readily enabled calculation of the molar equivalent of the red-colored recombinant protein, even in complex protein mixtures. Both C-TIMP-4 and C-TIMP-2 bound pro-MMP-2 and blocked concanavalin A-induced cellular activation of the enzyme. Measurement ofkon rates revealed that the inhibition of MMP-2 by TIMP-4 is preceded by a C domain docking interaction, but in contrast to TIMP-2, this is not enhanced by a C-terminal tail interaction and so occurs at a slower rate. Indeed, the binding stability of C-TIMP-4 was unaltered by deletion of the C-terminal tail, but replacement with the tail of TIMP-2 increased its affinity for pro-MMP-2 by ∼2-fold, as did substitution with the TIMP-2 C-terminal tail acidic residues in the tail of C-TIMP-4 (V193E/Q194D). Conversely, substitution of the C-terminal tail of C-TIMP-2 with that of TIMP-4 reduced pro-MMP-2 binding by ∼75%, as did reduction of its acidic character by mutation to the corresponding TIMP-4 amino acid residues (E192V/D193Q). Together, this shows the importance of Glu192 and Asp193 in TIMP-2 binding to pro-MMP-2; the lack of these acidic residues in the TIMP-4 C-terminal tail, which reduces the stability of complex formation with the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain, probably precludes TIMP-4 from supporting the activation of pro-MMP-2.

In view of these diverse and biologically important functions, it is not surprising that MMPs are under tight regulatory control, both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (17Overall C.M.

Post-translational regulation is also pivotally important in regulating proteolytic activity in the pericellular and extracellular compartments and involves zymogen activation and inhibition by four endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (2Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Google Scholar). In contrast to the majority of MMPs, MMP-2 is constitutively expressed by a large number of cell types, indicating its importance during normal cellular functions, and is frequently overexpressed in metastatic tumors or reactive stroma (3Egeblad M.

Hence, activation of the MMP-2 zymogen is a critical control point in regulating its activity (21Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J.

The MT1-MMP pathway requires TIMP-2 to tether pro-MMP-2 to MT1-MMP (21Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J.

Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3610-3618Google Scholar). The inhibitory N-terminal domain of TIMP-2 binds the MT1-MMP catalytic domain, inhibiting its activity, and the TIMP-2 C-terminal noninhibitory domain docks with the pro-MMP-2 hemopexin C domain, generating a ternary complex (23Strongin A.Y.

Pro-MMP-2 is then activated on the cell surface after forming a quaternary activation complex with a free MT1-MMP molecule, a process particularly sensitive to TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 levels (24Butler G.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39005-39014Google Scholar). In contrast, the TIMP-2-independent activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT2-MMP is only inhibited by TIMP-2 (27Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bigg H.F. Roberts C.R. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47402-47410Google Scholar). Although yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the isolated C domain of TIMP-2 stably interacts with the hemopexin C domain of MMP-2 (10McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Google Scholar, 28Overall C.M. Tam E. McQuibban G.A. Morrison C. Wallon U.M. Bigg H.F. King A.E. Roberts C.R. J. Biol.

Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3610-3618Google Scholar, 32Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E. Steffensen B. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15496-15500Google Scholar), but it is unable to support pro-MMP-2 activation or to compete with TIMP-2 in the binding of pro-MMP-2 (26Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3610-3618Google Scholar). However, TIMP-4 can inhibit the activation of pro-MMP-2 by inhibiting free MT1-MMP (26Bigg H.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47402-47410Google Scholar). Similarly, TIMP-3 has been shown to bind pro-MMP-2 and can inhibit MT-MMPs (34Butler G.S. Apte S.S. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10846-10851Google Scholar), but its ability to support activation by MT1-MMP is not reported. Hence, the role of TIMP-4 in binding pro-MMP-2 remains unknown, and the structural or sequence constraints that preclude the formation of functional trimolecular complexes remain to be characterized.TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 have nine additional C-terminal amino acid residues, termed the C-terminal tail, compared with TIMP-1 (Table I). Notably, TIMP-1 is the only member of the TIMP family that cannot interact with pro-MMP-2 through its C domain (35Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17972-17977Google Scholar, 36Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 637-641Google Scholar) or inhibit MT-MMPs through its inhibitory N-domain (24Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Google Scholar). Mutagenic analysis has identified key amino acids in the A-B loop of the N-domain of TIMP-2, which are absent in TIMP-1, accounting for its lack of MT1-MMP-inhibitory properties (37Butler G.S. Hutton M. Wattam B.A. Williamson R.A. Knauper V. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20391-20396Google Scholar). The TIMP-2 C-terminal tail was proposed to be critical for binding both active and pro-MMP-2 at the same site on the hemopexin C domain (38Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Google Scholar, 39Willenbrock F. Murphy G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150 (Suppl.): 165-170Google Scholar). However, this docking site was mapped by mutagenesis to lie at the junction of modules III and IV on the lower rim of the hemopexin C domain (40Overall C.M. King A.E. Sam D.K. Ong A.D. Lau T.T. Wallon U.M. DeClerck Y.A. Atherstone J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4421-4429Google Scholar). Hence, this indicated that the binding interaction to pro-MMP-2 differs from the inhibitory complex formed between TIMP-2 and active MMPs in which TIMPs adopt an elongated wedge morphology (41Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Google Scholar).Table IAlignment of the C-terminal domains of human TIMP-1 to -4 Open table in a new tab The C-terminal tails of TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 differ by four residues, two of which (Glu192 and Asp193) are acidic in TIMP-2, making this tail more anionic than that of TIMP-4 (Table I). The negatively charged tail is proposed to form salt bridges with cationic clusters located on the hemopexin C domain of MMP-2 (40Overall C.M. King A.E. Sam D.K. Ong A.D. Lau T.T. Wallon U.M. DeClerck Y.A. Atherstone J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4421-4429Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the absence of the two anionic residues from the C-terminal tail of TIMP-4 reduces the binding affinity of TIMP-4 for the hemopexin C domain of MMP-2 compared with TIMP-2, rendering it incapable of participating in pro-MMP-2 activation. After our present mutagenesis studies were initiated to test this hypothesis, the very recent report of the three-dimensional structure of TIMP-2 bound to pro-MMP-2 (42Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Google Scholar) confirmed the importance of the seven basic residues in the hemopexin C domain that we had previously identified by mutagenesis as being important in the interaction with TIMP-2 (40Overall C.M. King A.E. Sam D.K. Ong A.D. Lau T.T. Wallon U.M. DeClerck Y.A. Atherstone J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4421-4429Google Scholar). Further, the structure revealed the importance of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond formation and several salt bridges in the C domain of TIMP-2 that do not involve the C-terminal tail in forming the large ∼250-nm2 interface between these two complexed proteins (42Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal two residues of the tail were not resolved, so any potential salt bridge formation involving Asp193 could not be determined. Notably, the C-terminal tail binds the rim of hemopexin module III, starting at the interface with module IV (42Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Google Scholar), at an extended binding site that had also been previously identified by mutagenesis to be separate from the main binding site (40Overall C.M. King A.E. Sam D.K. Ong A.D. Lau T.T. Wallon U.M. DeClerck Y.A. Atherstone J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4421-4429Google Scholar). This site of interaction of the C-terminal tail on module III is intriguing; it is spatially and structurally distinct from the main interaction site of the C domain of TIMP-2 on the rim of hemopexin module IV (42Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Google Scholar), but its relatively small surface area belies the importance ascribed to the C-terminal tail previously in kinetic (38Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M.

Hence, unresolved from the structural studies is the relative importance played by the different contact elements of the binding surfaces to the total binding interaction which may be targeted by new anti-MMP drugs (18Overall C.M. López-Otı́n C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 657-672Google Scholar).To investigate the interactions and differences in the C domains of TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 (C-TIMP-4 and C-TIMP-2) in the binding and activation of pro-MMP-2, C-TIMP-4 and C-TIMP-2 were expressed independently to avoid any effects of the inhibitory N-domains. To facilitate this, we developed a novel expression system that utilizes the red-colored protein myoglobin as a fusion partner. Myoglobin has spectrometric properties that readily enable accurate protein quantitation throughout protein purification, even in complex mixtures. Differences between C-TIMP-4 and C-TIMP-2 binding of pro-MMP-2 were explored by mutagenesis. We report that the acidic residues Glu192 and Asp193 in the C-terminal tail of TIMP-2 are necessary for a stable interaction between TIMP-2 and pro-MMP-2; their absence from the C-terminal tail of TIMP-4 appears to preclude formation of a stable trimolecular complex with pro-MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, so TIMP-4 is unable to promote the activation of pro-MMP-2.DISCUSSIONThe different hemopexin C domain and TIMP interactions that occur on forming the noninhibitory complexes of TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 with pro-MMP-2 compared with those made in the binding and inhibition of active MMP-2 render interpretation of TIMP binding studies complex. The MMP-2, TIMP-2, and MT1-MMP ternary complex has been extensively studied by many groups (21Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. APMIS. 1999; 107: 38-44Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of pro-MMP-2 alone is unable to bind to full-length TIMP-2 (24Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Google Scholar), and since N-TIMP-2 inhibits MT1-MMP and MMP-2 in the absence of the TIMP-2 C domain (37Butler G.S.

These deletion mutant studies were supported by MMP-2 hemopexin C domain binding studies (28Overall C.M. Tam E. McQuibban G.A. Morrison C. Wallon U.M. Bigg H.F. King A.E. Roberts C.R. J. Biol.

Atherstone J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4421-4429Google Scholar), yeast two-hybrid analysis (10McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M.

A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Google Scholar). TIMP-4 was also found to bind the TIMP-2 docking site of pro-MMP-2 (32Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E. Steffensen B. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15496-15500Google Scholar), but when so bound cannot also bind the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP, despite its potent inhibitory properties for this MMP (26Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3610-3618Google Scholar) and so cannot form a ternary complex.The TIMP C domains had not previously been expressed and characterized in the absence of the N-domain, which would simplify the analysis of TIMP binding interactions; nor had the differences between TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 been explored by mutagenesis to define the crucial molecular determinants that form the pro-MMP-2 binding site and that determine binding affinity. Therefore, to dissect the differences in the domain interactions that occur in the activation and inhibition of MMP-2, the C domains of TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 were expressed with an N-terminal horse heart myoglobin fusion protein in E. coli. Due to myoglobin's red color, which results from the bound heme cofactor, the recombinant fusion proteins could be visually tracked and quantified spectrophotometrically by measuring the Soret absorbance at 408 nm. This is a decided advantage over fusion partners such as β-galactosidase, which cannot be monitored in this manner. We found that C-TIMP-4 and C-TIMP-2 bind to the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain as an isolated domain or in the context of full-length pro-MMP-2. However, C-TIMP-2 binds less avidly than full-length TIMP-2. The lack of the N-terminal domain may partially destabilize the C-TIMP domain, leading to a weaker interaction with the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain. It is unlikely that myoglobin sterically hinders this interaction, since C-TIMP-4 binds pro-MMP-2 with only slightly less affinity than TIMP-4. Hence, the present studies using TIMP C domain proteins biochemically confirm that this domain is necessary and sufficient for the noninhibitory TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 interaction with pro-MMP-2 on the hemopexin C domain.TIMP binding to the hemopexin C domain of pro-MMP-2 is distinct from the more dynamic interactions that occur during binding and inhibition of active MMP-2. Following mapping of the noninhibitory TIMP-2 docking site on the hemopexin C domain of pro-MMP-2 by mutagenesis studies, it was evident that topographically this site cannot be used for inhibitory complex formation with active MMP-2 (40Overall C.M. King A.E. Sam D.K. Ong A.D. Lau T.T. Wallon U.M. DeClerck Y.A. Atherstone J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4421-4429Google Scholar). This prompted alternate explanations involving two structurally and functionally distinct binding sites for TIMP-2 on the hemopexin C domain of pro- and active MMP-2, termed the docking and stabilization sites, respectively (5Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Google Scholar, 26Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3610-3618Google Scholar, 28Overall C.M.

The TIMP stabilization site on the hemopexin C domain increases the affinity of TIMP binding to the active site cleft (24Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Google Scholar), forming stabilizing contacts with all TIMPs when bound in the elongated wedge orientation (41Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Google Scholar). Homologous stabilization sites are predicted on all MMP hemopexin C domains for all inhibitory TIMP interactions (5Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Google Scholar). Our presentkon data shows that C-TIMP-4 and C-TIMP-2 slowed the inhibition of MMP-2 by full-length TIMP-4 or TIMP-2, respectively. Since the C-TIMP proteins are noninhibitory as expected, this suggests that binding of the C-TIMP proteins to the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain prevents full-length TIMP-4 or TIMP-2 binding at the hemopexin C domain docking site. This initial docking interaction has only been characterized for TIMP-2 inhibition of active MMP-2 where TIMP-2 was demonstrated to utilize its anionic C-terminal tail (38Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Google Scholar). Competition of C-TIMP-4 with TIMP-4 suggests that a C domain docking interaction also initiates and enhances the rate of inhibition of active MMP-2 by TIMP-4, although, unlike TIMP-2, this is not driven by a C-terminal tail interaction and consequently occurs at a slower rate.Although a structure has not been reported for any full-length TIMP in an inhibitory complex with a full-length active MMP, modeling predictions suggest that the stabilization site lies on the rim of the hemopexin C domain at the junction of modules I and II that are proximal to the active site (5Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Google Scholar). Hence, in the inhibitory interaction, the TIMP-2 C domain cannot bind in the same orientation that occurs at the docking site mapped by mutagenesis and crystallography to the rim of the hemopexin C domain on the opposite side of the molecule along the edge of modules III and I"

Transgenic mice that express the dominant-negative CREB protein in B lymphocytes were developed as a means to study the effects of the inhibition of CREB function on B-cell proliferation and survival. We have shown previously that CREB up-regulates Bcl-2 expression in B cells in response to activation signals. B cells from CREBM1 transgenic mice expressed lower levels of Bcl-2 with and without stimulation. Proliferation of B cells from the transgenic mice was impaired in part by lack of induction of activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factors. B cells from the transgenic mice were more susceptible to induction of apoptosis with several different agents, consistent with the decreased expression of Bcl-2. These studies demonstrate that B-cell activation requires phosphorylation of CREB for the proliferative response and to protect against activation-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2043363480,"Abstract Heparin and heparan sulfate fragments, obtained by bacterial heparinase and heparitinases, bearing an unsaturation at C4-C5 of the uronic acid moiety, are able to produce up to 80% reduction of the cytosolic calcium of smooth muscle cell lines. Unsaturated disaccharides from chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid are inactive, indicating that, besides the unsaturation of the uronic acid, a vicinal 1 → 4 glycosidic linkage is needed. An inverse correlation between the molecular weight and activity is observed. Thus, the ED50 of the N-acetylated disaccharide derived from heparan sulfate (430 Da) is 88 μm compared with 250 μm of the trisulfated disaccharide (650 Da) derived from heparin. Except for enoxaparin (which contains an unsaturation at the non-reducing end and 1 → 4 glycosidic linkage), other low molecular weight heparins and native heparin are practically inactive in reducing the cytosolic calcium levels. Thapsigargin (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor), vanadate (cytoplasmic membrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor), and nifedipine and verapamil (Ca2+ channel antagonists) do not interfere with the effect of the trisulfated disaccharide upon the decrease of the intracellular calcium. A significant decrease of the activity of the trisulfated disaccharide is observed by reducing extracellular sodium, suggesting that the fragments might act upon the Na+/Ca2+exchanger promoting the extrusion of Ca2+. This was further substantiated by binding experiments and circular dichroism analysis with the exchanger inhibitor peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1976362917,"The factor H family in humans is composed of seven distinct proteins, including factor H-related proteins (FHR) 1-5. All members contain tandemly arranged short consensus repeats (SCR) typical of the regulators of complement activation gene family. FHR-5 is unusual for this group of proteins, as it was initially identified as a component of immune deposits in glomerular diseases. During our cloning of the cDNA for rat factor H from glomerular epithelial cells (GEC), we identified an alternative 2729-bp cDNA transcript. The translated sequence encoded a protein containing 11 SCRs, most similar to SCRs 7-15 and 19-20 in native rat factor H, which is the same basic structure of human FHR-5. As such, this rat protein was termed FHR. Recombinant rat FHR produced in a eukaryotic expression system had a molecular mass of 78 kDa. In functional studies, recombinant FHR bound C3b and inhibited the complement alternative pathway in a dose-dependent fashion. Given the prominent expression of FHR-5 in human membranous nephropathy, a disease in which complement activation occurs in the vicinity of GEC, the expression of FHR in a rat model of this disease was evaluated. In both in vitro and in vivo models of complement activation on the GEC, FHR mRNA was up-regulated by a factor of 3-6-fold compared with controls in which complement could not be activated. Thus, we have identified a novel factor H family member in rats. This FHR protein is analogous to human FHR-5, both in structure and in potential involvement in glomerular immune complex diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2090459055,"Aes, a 36-kDa acetylesterase fromEscherichia coli, belongs to the hormone-sensitive lipase family, and it is involved in the regulation of MalT, the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon. The activity of MalT is depressed through a direct protein-protein interaction with Aes. Although the effect is clear-cut, the meaning of this interaction and the conditions that trigger it still remain elusive. To perform a comparative thermodynamic study between the mesophilic Aes protein and two homologous thermostable enzymes, Aes was overexpressed in E. coli and purified. At the last step of the purification procedure the enzyme was eluted from a Mono Q HR 5/5 column as a major form migrating, anomalously, at 56 kDa on a calibrated Superdex 75 column. A minor peak that contains the Aes protein and a polypeptide of 50 kDa was also detected. By a combined analysis of size-exclusion chromatography and surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, it was possible to demonstrate the presence in this peak of a stable 87-kDa complex, containing the Aes protein itself and the 50-kDa polypeptide in a 1:1 ratio. The homodimeric molecular species of Aes and of the 50-kDa polypeptide were also detected. The esterase activity associated with the 87-kDa complex, when assayed with p-nitrophenyl butanoate as substrate, proved 6-fold higher than the activity of the major Aes form of 56 kDa. Amino-terminal sequencing highlighted that the 50-kDa partner of Aes in the complex was the α-galactosidase from E. coli. TheE. coli cells harboring plasmid pT7-SCII-aesand, therefore, expressing Aes were hampered in their growth on a minimal medium containing raffinose as a sole carbon source. Because α-galactosidase is involved in the metabolism of raffinose, the above findings suggest a potential role of Aes in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in E. coli.

Because α-galactosidase is involved in the metabolism of raffinose, the above findings suggest a potential role of Aes in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in E. coli. The Escherichia coli aes (or ybac) gene encodes the 36-kDa cytoplasmic protein Aes (1Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Google Scholar), a carboxylesterase belonging to the hormone-sensitive lipase family (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; pNP, p-nitrophenyl; LB, Luria-Bertani; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; SELDI-TOF, surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry; EST2, esterase 2; AFEST, Archaeoglobus fulgidus esterase. (2Kanaya S. Koyanagi T. Kanaya E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 75-80Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of this enzyme is still obscure, it has recently received greater attention due to the discovery that Aes is involved in the regulation of the maltose regulon in E. coli (reviewed in Ref. 3Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Google Scholar). The E. coli maltose system consists of 10 genes encoding proteins for the uptake and metabolism of maltodextrin and maltose (3Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Google Scholar). MalT is the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon and the prototype of a new family of transcription factors (4Valdez F. Gonzalez-Ceron G. Kieser H.M. Servin-Gonzalez L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2365-2374Google Scholar,5De Schrijver A. De Mot R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1287-1288Google Scholar) and integrates several signals through its amino-terminal three domains (6Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Google Scholar). To activate mal genes transcription MalT acts together with the cyclic AMP-catabolite protein complex, the inducer maltotriose, and ATP (7Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Google Scholar). Several regulatory circuits modulate the activity of MalT, e.g. MalT expression is regulated by Mlc, a glucose-inducible repressor (8Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Google Scholar). In addition, MalT is negatively controlled by at least three proteins: MalY, MalK, and Aes. MalY is an enzyme with cystathionine β-lyase activity (9Reidl J. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4862-4876Google Scholar, 10Zdich E. Peist R. Reidl J. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5035-5039Google Scholar), which interacts directly with the amino terminus of MalT (11Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Google Scholar, 12Schlegel A. Danot O. Richet E. Ferenci T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3069-3077Google Scholar), seemingly through a patch made up of a hydrophobic core surrounded by highly polar residues (13Clausen T. Schlegel A. Peist R. Schneider E. Steegborn C. Chang Y. Haase A. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Boos W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 831-842Google Scholar). MalK, the ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the maltose transport system (14Kuhnau S. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2180-2186Google Scholar), has been reported to interact directly with MalT (15Panagiatodis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Google Scholar), probably through some residues localized in its C-terminal domain (16Böhm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3708-3717Google Scholar). With regard to the Aes protein, it has been demonstrated that Aes controls MalT activity through a direct protein-protein interaction that counteracts the binding of the MalT effector maltotriose, and it was postulated that the Aes binding site is mostly located in DT1 domain of MalT, which contains also the ATP binding site (17Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Google Scholar). Accordingly, ATP and ADP differently affect the competition between Aes and the inducer (maltotriose) as regards the binding to MalT. A working model is one in which maltotriose stabilizes the ATP-bound form of MalT that consequently is more prone to oligomerization to bind DNA, whereas Aes and/or MalY antagonise(s) this effect and in doing so it (they) prevent(s) oligomerization. The one or more sites of interaction on MalT of Aes and MalY are probably superimposed, whereas MalK would appear to interact at a different location (12Schlegel A. Danot O. Richet E. Ferenci T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3069-3077Google Scholar). It is possible that MalY and Aes share similar structural determinants, but these cannot be easily predicted on the basis of sequences analysis only (13Clausen T. Schlegel A. Peist R. Schneider E. Steegborn C. Chang Y. Haase A. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Boos W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 831-842Google Scholar). It has been reported that the basal level of aes expression is very low (1Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Google Scholar). However, the introduction of a plasmid harboring theaes gene was required to allow E. coli growth on minimal medium supplemented with triacetylglycerol (triacetin) as sole carbon source. Moreover, the existence of a repressor of theaes gene has also been postulated (1Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Google Scholar), thus suggesting the importance of this enzyme in particular growth conditions. We have been working for several years on the structure-function relationship in thermostable carboxylesterases from the HSL family (18Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Google Scholar,19Manco G. Giosue E. D'Auria S. Herman P. Carrea G. Rossi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 182-192Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the three-dimensional structures of EST2 from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, a thermophilic eubacterium (20De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Google Scholar), and of the homologous enzyme AFEST, from the hyper-thermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus (21De Simone G. Menchise V. Manco G. Mandrich L. Sorrentino N. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 507-518Google Scholar). We also reported some structural and thermodynamic studies on both enzymes (22D'Auria S. Herman P. Lakowicz J.R. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Rossi M. Manco G. Proteins. 2000; 38: 351-360Google Scholar, 23Manco G. Mandrich L. Rossi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37482-37490Google Scholar, 24Del Vecchio P. Graziano G. Granata V. Barone G. Mandrich L. Manco G. Rossi M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1364-1371Google Scholar). To perform a comparative analysis with a mesophilic member of the HSL family we started the cloning of aes from E. coli genomic DNA, the overexpression of the protein in E. coli, and its purification. Quite surprisingly we isolated a complex, which had never been previously described, of the Aes enzyme with an E. coli 50-kDa polypeptide that we demonstrate here to be the α-galactosidase, an enzyme belonging to the family 4 of the glycosylhydrolases. This enzyme is implicated in the degradation of α-galactosides such as galactose oligosaccharides, galactomannans, and galactolipids (25Schmid K. Schmitt R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 95-104Google Scholar), and therefore directly involved in the E. coli carbohydrate metabolism. p-Nitrophenyl (pNP) butanoate,pNP-α-d-galactopyranoside,pNP-α-d-arabinopyranoside, Fast Blue RR, β-naphthyl acetate, and raffinose were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). E. coli DH5α strain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used as the host for cloning, whereasE. coli BL21(DE3) cells harbored the recombinant plasmid for gene expression. The aes gene was amplified fromE. coli genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction with the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), using oligonucleotides ybacoli-nde(5′-GGAGTTTTCATATGAAGCCGGAAAACAAACTA-3′) andybacoli-pst(5′-TCTACAGTCGACCTGCAGATCGAAATGATGGCTA-3′) as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplification reaction was performed in a 30-cycle PCR (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The amplification primers ybacoli-nde andybacoli-pst were designed to introduce NdeI andPstI restriction sites (underlined) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene, respectively. The amplified band was cut with restriction enzymes NdeI and PstI, purified with an agarose gel-extraction kit (Quiaex II, Quiagen), and ligated into theNdeI/PstI-linearized expression vector pT7-SCII (26Brown W.C. Campbell J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 99-103Google Scholar) to create a pT7-SCII-aes construct. The cloned fragment was completely sequenced to verify that no undesired mutations were introduced during amplification. The aes gene was expressed under the direct control of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter of the φ10 gene (26Brown W.C. Campbell J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 99-103Google Scholar). E. coliBL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the pT7-SCII-aesconstruct and cultured at a large scale in 5 liters of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells, at a density corresponding to an optical density value of 1 at 600 nm, were treated with 0.5 mm IPTG for 4 h. Thereafter, cells (40 g wet weight) were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 ×g, 4 °C, 10 min), washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5)/2.5 mm MgCl2/0.5 mmEDTA (buffer A), and stored at −20 °C. Finally, when required, cells were thawed and re-dissolved in 100 ml of buffer A. Disruption was achieved with a French Press cell, and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). Purification of the recombinant enzyme was adapted from a previously described procedure for EST2 and AFEST (18Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Google Scholar, 19Manco G. Giosue E. D'Auria S. Herman P. Carrea G. Rossi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 182-192Google Scholar). The crude extract was treated with 10% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and centrifuged (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The supernatant was made 40% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and centrifuged again (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The pellet was re-dissolved in 100 ml of buffer A and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (20 × 2.6 cm, AmershamBiosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in buffer A. After 2 volumes of washing, a linear gradient of NaCl (from 0 to 1 m) was applied. Active fractions were pooled, made 10% (w/v) in ammonium sulfate, and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/10 Phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in buffer A containing 10% ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted by a decreasing gradient (10% to 0%) of ammonium sulfate in buffer A. Esterase activity was eluted at the end of the gradient. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and fractionated by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 M) onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column run over an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Most of the applied activity was eluted at 300 mm NaCl in a large peak (peak A), whereas a small peak (peak B) was also observed at 380 mm NaCl. The most active fractions were pooled and stored at 4 °C, until used. The time course of the esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNP butanoate,pNP-α-d-galactopyranoside, andpNP-α-d-arabinopyranoside was followed by monitoring of p-nitrophenoxide production at 405 nm, in a 1-cm path-length cell with a CARY 100 Scan spectrophotometer (Varian, Victoria, Australia). Initial rates were calculated by linear least-squares analysis of time courses comprising less than 10% of the total turnover. Esterase assays were performed at 25 °C in mixture of 40 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4/4% acetonitrile (pH 7.1) containing pNP butanoate at different concentrations. Stock solutions of pNP butanoate were prepared by dissolving the substrate in pure acetonitrile. α-Galactosidase assays were performed at 25 °C in a mixture of 40 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4/1 mm MgCl2/1 mm NADH (pH 7.1) containing 1.5 mm pNP-α-d-galactopyranoside orpNP-α-d-arabinopyranoside. One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of protein releasing 1 μmol of p-nitrophenoxide/min from pNP butanoate or pNP-galactoside at 25 °C. The absorption coefficient used for p-nitrophenoxide was 17,000m−1 cm−1. The protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay system, using bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) as standard. Initial velocity versussubstrate concentration data were fitted to the Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation, by weighted linear least-squares analysis with a personal computer and the Grafit program (27Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit version 3.0. Erithacus Softwere Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). Assays were done in duplicate or triplicate, and results for kinetic data were the mean of two independent experiments. Substrate concentration was in the range 10–1000 μm. The ratio of Aes and α-galactosidase, in samples containing both proteins, was calculated by densitometric analysis of gels scanned by using the image acquisition device ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad), equipped with the software Quantity One, according to the manufacturer's specifications. To calculate the specific esterase activity of Aes alone, the absolute amount of Aes in the complex was calculated on the basis of a Aes calibration curve obtained by running different amounts of purified Aes onto the same gel. Size-exclusion chromatography experiments were performed with a High Load 16/60 Superdex 75 column run over an FPLC apparatus. The column was equilibrated and eluted with buffer A containing, when indicated, 500 mm urea. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. The column was calibrated in the condition outlined above, using the following molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden): cytochrome c(12,500 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), bovine serum albumin (67,000 Da), and blue dextran (2000 kDa). Electrophoretic runs were performed with a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II cell unit, at room temperature. SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Molecular mass markers (Prestained SDS-PAGE Standard Broad Range, Bio-Rad) were: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (120 kDa), bovine serum albumin (84 kDa), ovalbumin (52 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (36 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 kDa), lysozyme (22 kDa), and aprotinin (7.4 kDa). 15% non-denaturing PAGE at alkaline pH was performed using the same buffer and loading solutions of SDS-PAGE lacking SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. As to the in situ esterase activity staining, after electrophoretic run, gels were washed in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5)/2.5 mmMgCl2/0.5 mm EDTA for 2 h and then were incubated in a solution (100 ml) of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mg of β-naphthyl acetate and 25 mg of Fast Blue RR at room temperature. After 5 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by rinsing with tap water. A sample from the Superdex 75 column (fraction number 23) containing the 87-kDa complex (see “Results”) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE to separate the 36- and 50-kDa bands. Thereafter, bands were electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membranes, stained with Coomassie Blue as above, and then submitted for amino-terminal sequence analysis. Only the band corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 was excised and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis on an ABI Procise protein sequencer (29Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Google Scholar), according to the manufacturer's pulse-phase protocol. The determined amino acid sequence was then used to search against the European Bioinformatics Institute protein data base using the Fasta 33 algorithm (30Weinberger S.R. Morris T.S. Pawlak M. Pharmacogenomics. 2000; 1: 395-416Google Scholar). Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF) analysis was carried out using the Ciphergen Protein Chip System (Ciphergen, Palo Alto, CA). SELDI analysis was performed using a hydrophobic H4 protein chips, containing a long chain aliphatic surface. The samples were applied to a spot, washed with 5% acetonitrile, and allowed to dry. To the dry spot 0.5 μl of matrix was added and allowed to crystallize. The matrix was a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 50% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The protein chips were transferred to the Ciphergen SELDI reader and analyzed by Ciphergen SELDI Protein Biology System II externally calibrated with myoglobin, equine (16,951.5 Da); horseradish peroxidase (43,240 Da); and Conalbumin, chicken (77,490 Da). The mass identification was performed by averaging at least 50 laser shots (laser intensity = 290) of various regions of the ProteinChip surface. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with vector pT7-SCII, with or without the aes gene, were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and cultured at a cell density corresponding to an optical density value of 0.2 at 600 nm. The cultures were 20-fold diluted in minimal medium M9 (50 ml) containing 2% raffinose as carbon source and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). A second culture of E. coli transformed with pT7-SCII-aeswas prepared as above but supplemented with 0.5 mm IPTG. After 4, 20, and 28 h of incubation, an aliquot (15 ml) of each culture was harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), cells were re-dissolved in 5 ml of 25 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) and disrupted with a French Press cell. Cellular extracts were recovered by centrifugation. Portions of 100 and 10 μl of each extract were used for the α-galactosidase and esterase assays, respectively. The gene aes (also known as ybac) from E. coli encoding the esterase Aes (2Kanaya S. Koyanagi T. Kanaya E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 75-80Google Scholar) was cloned from E. coli genomic DNA by PCR amplification. Two oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”) were designed to introduce the restriction sites NdeI and PstI at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene, respectively. The PCR product (of the expected size) was purified from an agarose gel, cut with NdeI andPstI, and ligated into the expression vector PT7-SCII, which had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. DNA sequencing confirmed that no undesired mutations were introduced into the gene. The cloning procedure adopted put the gene under the control of the IPTG-inducible φ10 promoter (26Brown W.C. Campbell J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 99-103Google Scholar), and the protein was expressed without tags being added at the amino- or carboxyl-terminal sides. The overexpression in BL21(DE3) cells was obtained by 4-h induction with 0.5 mm IPTG, and the enzyme was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At the final purification step, proteins were fractionated by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column using an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Most of the applied activity was eluted in a large peak (peak A) at 300 mmNaCl, whereas a small peak (peak B) was also observed at 380 mm NaCl (Fig. 1). The SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, inset) showed that the Aes protein, with an apparent molecular weight of 36,000, was present alone in peak A (fraction number 26) and displayed a specific activity of 28 units/mg, when assayed with pNP butanoate as substrate at 25 °C. Peak B (inset of Fig. 1; fractions 34 and 35) contained a second band of an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 in addition to the 36-kDa band. Quite interestingly, the esterase specific activity of Aes alone (103 units/mg) in peak B (measured as described under “Experimental Procedures”) appeared higher (about 4-fold) as compared with that present in peak A. To explain the difference in specific activities said above, having suspected a physical interaction between Aes and the 50-kDa polypeptide, the proteins from both peaks A and B were analyzed by gel filtration experiments. An aliquot (1 ml, 4.5 mg of protein) from peak A was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (AmershamBiosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), previously calibrated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It gave a single peak of apparently 56 kDa (Fig. 2, upper trace), which was a value higher than expected on the basis of the Aes sequence (about 36,000) and in agreement with the result of 57 kDa reported by Joly et al. (17Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Google Scholar). These authors suggested that Aes is either an asymmetric monomer or a dimeric form delayed in its elution because of interactions with the column matrix. The possibility of a dynamic equilibrium between the monomer and a dimer was ruled out, because there was no dependence from protein concentration (17Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Google Scholar). When an aliquot of peak B (1 ml, 5 mg of protein obtained from the Mono Q column) was similarly analyzed by gel filtration, it was found to consist of a major peak of apparently 89 kDa and a minor one eluting at the same position where the 56-kDa Aes form was eluted (Fig. 2,lower dashed trace). The SDS-PAGE analysis (insetof Fig. 2) showed that the 89-kDa peak (fractions 20–28) contained again the 50- and 36-kDa bands and that the 56-kDa peak contained the 36-kDa band (fractions 36 and 37). A careful analysis by densitometry of the SDS-PAGE bands corresponding to the fractions from the major peak was performed. It indicated that the ratio between the intensity of 36- and 50-kDa bands ranged from 1:1 in fractions 20–24, to 2:1 in fractions 25 and 26, to 3:1 in fraction 27. To explain this elution pattern, we hypothesized that the Aes protein could be involved in a putative complex with a 50-kDa form (theoretical molecular weight 86,700) and that this complex co-migrated with a dimeric form of Aes. The Aes protein found in the minor peak of Superdex 75 could derive either from a cross-contamination with the monomeric Aes in the previous step or from a slow dissociation of dimeric Aes. The 50-kDa polypeptide cannot be MalT, which interacts directly with Aes (17Joly N. Danot O. Schlegel A. Boos W. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16606-16613Google Scholar), given the large difference in their respective molecular masses (50 versus 96 kDa) (4Valdez F. Gonzalez-Ceron G. Kieser H.M. Servin-Gonzalez L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2365-2374Google Scholar, 5De Schrijver A. De Mot R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1287-1288Google Scholar). In an attempt to clarify the relationship between Aes and the 50-kDa polypeptide in the 89-kDa peak, we performed a 15% non-denaturing PAGE followed by either Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3A) or by in situactivity staining (panel B). As shown in the figure most of the protein (and activity) associated with monomeric Aes (Aes lanes) migrated at a very different position with respect to the one or more complexes (Complex lane), which yielded slowly migrating bands, as well as one minor band migrating at the same position of monomeric Aes, all displaying esterase activity. A two-dimensional gel analysis (data not shown) proved inconclusive given that the 50-kDa polypeptide in part was associated with the first band shown in Fig. 3A (Complex lane) and in part was spread along all the gel, particularly in association with the remaining active bands, suggesting a dissociation of the complex during the electrophoresis run. To assess whether the monomeric Aes observed both in the gel filtration and the non-denaturing PAGE was generated by the 89-kDa complex, we re-chromatographed the major peak (89 kDa) from previous gel-filtration on the same column equilibrated in buffer A and containing 500 mm urea. The rational of this experiment was to determine which protein-protein interactions, within the one or more complexes, were destroyed by the presence of urea. As shown in Fig. 2(lower continuous trace), the complexes-containing peak eluted at the same position at which it was eluted in the absence of urea; in addition, a small peak was eluted at a position slightly delayed with respect to the monomeric Aes (dotted trace). Finally, the ratio between the two peaks appeared reduced, indicating a partial conversion from the higher to the lower form. The SDS-PAGE (data not shown) showed the Aes protein and the 50-kDa polypeptide in a 1:1 ratio in the major peak, the 36-kDa Aes band in the smallest peak, and a tiny amount of the 50-kDa form between both. In conclusion, it is likely that the Aes protein forms a stable 1:1 complex with a polypeptide of 50 kDa, which co-migrates with a dimeric Aes and that the latter dissociates in 500 mm urea. The small increase in the band of 50 kDa between the complex and Aes may be ascribed to a minor dissociation either of the complex or of a putative minor 50-kDa dimeric form or of both. The urea seems also to affect the migration of the monomeric Aes, because it eluted at a slightly lower molecular weight (about 53 kDa), compared with the run without urea. This result suggests a conformational switch in the monomeric Aes that can be responsible for its anomalous migration on the Superdex 75 column. In fact, when the same sample, after a prolonged incubation with 500 mm urea (1 month at 4 °C) and urea removal by diafiltration, was run over a Superdex 200 analytical column, it gave an active Aes migrating at a molecular weight closer to the expected 36,000 value, whereas the non-incubated Aes migrated again with a molecular weight of 56,000 (data not shown). To investigate the molecular masses of the species mentioned above, an aliquot of fraction 23 obtained by gel filtration and consisting of the 89-kDa peak (Aes:50 kDa ratio of 1:1, Fig. 2, lower dotted trace) was examined by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 4A, the fraction 23, from the Superdex 75 column (Fig. 2), contained two major molecular species, exhibiting mass values of 36,038 and 50,665.7 Da corresponding to Aes and 50-kDa polypeptide. We also observed species with"
https://openalex.org/W2037233579,"Membrane-bound transferrin-like protein (MTf) is expressed in parallel with the expression of cartilage-characteristic genes during differentiation of chondrocytes, and the MTf level is much higher in cartilage than in other tissues. To investigate the role of MTf in cartilage, we examined the effects of growth factors on MTf expression in mouse prechondrogenic ATDC5 cells and the effect of MTf overexpression on differentiation of ATDC5 and mouse pluripotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells. In ATDC5 cultures, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and transforming growth factor-β as well as insulin induced MTf mRNA expression when these peptides induced chondrogenic differentiation. Forced expression of rabbit MTf in ATDC5 cells induced aggrecan, type II collagen, matrilin-1, type X collagen mRNAs, and cell-shape changes from fibroblastic cells to spherical chondrocytes. Accordingly, the synthesis and accumulation of proteoglycans were higher in MTf-expressing cultures than in control cultures. These effects of MTf overexpression correlated with the MTf protein level on the cell surface and decreased in the presence of anti-MTf antibody. However, the aggrecan mRNA level in the ATDC5 cells overexpressing MTf was lower than that in wild type ATDC5 cells exposed to 10 μg/ml insulin. MTf overexpression in C3H10T1/2 cells also induced aggrecan and/or type II collagen mRNA but not the spherical phenotype. These findings suggest that the expression of MTf on the cell surface facilitates the differentiation of prechondrogenic cells, although MTf overexpression alone seems to be insufficient to commit pluripotent mesenchymal cells to the chondrocyte lineage.

MTf is linked to the outer surface of the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (4Rose T.M. Plowman G.D. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Hellstrom K.E. Brown J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1261-1265Google Scholar). MTf is present at high or moderate levels in melanomas and some other tumors (5Brown J.P. Woodbury R.G. Hart C.E. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 539-543Google Scholar, 6Woodbury R.G. Brown J.P. Loop S.M. Hellstrom K.E. Hellstrom I. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 27: 145-149Google Scholar). In addition, it is expressed in many fetal tissues including the intestine and several adult tissues including salivary glands, sweat glands, eosinophils, brain capillaries, and cartilage (7Kawamoto T. Pan H. Yan W. Ishida H. Usui E. Oda R. Nakamasu K. Noshiro M. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Fujii M. Shintani H. Okada Y. Kato Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 503-509Google Scholar, 8Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B.

MTf may be involved in iron metabolism, proliferation, or differentiation in these tissues or pathological responses in certain tissues such as plaques of Alzheimer disease (12Richardson D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1290-1298Google Scholar). However, the role of MTf remains unknown. Recently we purified MTf from the plasma membrane of rabbit chondrocytes as a 76-kDa concanavalin A-binding “chondrocyte-specific” protein (7Kawamoto T. Pan H. Yan W. Ishida H. Usui E. Oda R. Nakamasu K. Noshiro M. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Fujii M. Shintani H. Okada Y. Kato Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 503-509Google Scholar). We found that the MTf level is much higher (100-fold) in the cartilage of young rabbits and adult mice than in the other tested tissues including the intestine, liver, and brain (7Kawamoto T. Pan H. Yan W. Ishida H. Usui E. Oda R. Nakamasu K. Noshiro M. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Fujii M. Shintani H. Okada Y. Kato Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 503-509Google Scholar, 13Nakamasu K. Kawamoto T. Shen M. Gotoh O. Teramoto M. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 258-264Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cultures of ATDC5 cells, MTf is expressed developmentally in parallel with the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan, in a pattern commensurate with the onset of chondrogenesis to form cartilage nodules. In rabbit chondrocyte cultures, MTf expression is down-regulated by retinoic acid or passage of the culture, when these treatments suppressed chondrocyte phenotypic expression. 2R. Oda, K. Suardita, K. Fujimoto, H. Pan, W. Yan, A. Shimazu, H. Shintani, and Y. Kato, unpublished data. These observations suggested that MTf is involved in chondrogenic differentiation. ATDC5 cells maintain an undifferentiated state or the properties of chondroprogenitor cells in the presence of 5% serum in the absence of added growth factors. However, insulin (10 μg/ml) or insulin growth factor I (IGF-I) (300 ng/ml) induces chondrogenic differentiation of the cells through a cellular condensation process, resulting in the formation of cartilage nodules and the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan mRNAs (14Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Google Scholar, 15Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Google Scholar). Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 or transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) also up-regulates the expression of type II collagen mRNA in these cells (16Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Google Scholar, 17Nakamura K. Shirai T. Morishita S. Uchida S. Saeki-Miura K. Makishima F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 351-363Google Scholar). ATDC5 cells synthesize fibroblast growth factor, parathyroid hormone-related protein, BMP, TGF-β, and other signaling molecules, each with a unique temporal pattern (15Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Google Scholar, 16Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Google Scholar). The differentiation process in ATDC5 cultures is similar to that in cartilage in vivo, and thus ATDC5 cells have been used extensively for studies on chondrogenic differentiation. On the other hand, a mouse mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 has been used for studies on differentiation of mesenchymal cells to adipocytes, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes. In C3H10T1/2 cells, BMP-2 or TGF-β induces osteogenic, adipogenic, or chondrogenic differentiation (18Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 295-299Google Scholar, 19Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 57-71Google Scholar). We show here that BMP-2 and TGF-β, as well as insulin, induce MTf expression in ATDC5 cells. Furthermore, forced expression of MTf enhanced the expression of aggrecan and/or type II collagen in ATDC5 and C3H10T1/2 cells. MTf seems to be an important target for these growth factors and may modulate the signaling pathway leading to chondrogenic differentiation. ATDC5 cells were obtained from RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Japan) and Ham's F-12 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Japan) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 3 × 10−8m sodium selenite (Sigma) in the presence or absence (Medium A) of 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), as described previously (14Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Google Scholar). Inoculum density of the cells was 4 × 104 cells/16-mm dish, 8 × 104 cells/35-mm dish, or 20 × 104 cells/10-cm dish. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The medium was replaced every other day. C3H10T1/2 cells were obtained from RIKEN cell bank and maintained in α-modified essential medium (Sanko Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The medium was replaced every other day. Chondrocytes were isolated from the rib resting cartilage or growth plates of 4-week-old male Japanese white rabbits, as described previously (20Shimomura Y. Yoneda T. Suzuki F. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1975; 19: 179-187Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 106 cells/10-cm dish and maintained in α-modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 32 unit/ml penicillin, 60 μg/ml kanamycin (Meiji Seika Co., Tokyo, Japan), and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For construction of a rabbit MTf expression vector, rabbit MTf cDNA (full-length) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). MTf was expressed under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. Undifferentiated ATDC5 cells and C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with the expression vector (10 μg) containing rabbit MTf cDNA using SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen) in serum-free DMEM plus Ham's F12 medium (1:1). Two days after the transfection, the medium was replaced with Medium A supplemented with 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). After 2 weeks, several Zeocin-resistant clones were isolated. Each colony was plated in a 35-mm dish and cultured for 5 days and then transferred to a 10-cm dish. Total RNA was prepared according to the acid/guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Aliquots of the total RNA (10 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to NytranN membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was stained with 0.02% methylene blue to confirm the equal loading of the total RNA on each lane. The membranes were hybridized with the 32P-labeled probes in hybridization solution containing 6× saline-sodium citrate, 5x Denhardt's solution, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA at 68 °C. The membranes were washed with 0.1× saline-sodium citrate containing 0.5% SDS at 50 °C and were exposed to Kodak BioMax films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) at −80 °C. Cells were lysed with Laemmli buffer. Protein was separated on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Daiichi Pure Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) by electrophoresis. The protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon PVDF; Millipore) (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). The membrane was saturated for 1 h with blocking solution (Block Ace; Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co.) and washed several times with TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 500-fold diluted anti-rabbit MTf mouse antiserum (7Kawamoto T. Pan H. Yan W. Ishida H. Usui E. Oda R. Nakamasu K. Noshiro M. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Fujii M. Shintani H. Okada Y. Kato Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 503-509Google Scholar). After further washes with TTBS buffer, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1000-fold diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako A/S). The membrane was colored with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). ATDC5 cells overexpressing MTf and empty vector-integrated cells were incubated in PBS for 30 min at room temperature with anti-rabbit MTf monoclonal antibody (mAb2) or control IgG that was labeled using Zenon One Alexa Fluor 488 mouse IgG1 labeling kits (Molecular Probe, Inc., Eugene, OR). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were resuspend in PBS and analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. Total RNA was isolated from ATDC5 cells overexpressing rabbit MTf (M6). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Rabbit MTf cDNA were amplified by PCR using LA Taq polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with a forward primer 5′-ACTCACTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTGGCTAG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-TTAGGAAAGGACAGTGGGAGTGGCACCTTC-3′. PCR products were purified using Concert TM rapid PCR purification system (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence was determined using the Bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an ABI Prime 310 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of total RNA. PCR was performed using an aliquot of first-strand cDNA as a template under standard conditions with Klentaq polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for 18, 23, 22, 22, and 22 cycles for aggrecan, type II collagen, matrilin-1, type X collagen, and Sox9, respectively. The cycles were optimal for the comparison between the amplified products. For normalization of the RNA loading, RT-PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also performed in each RT-PCR reaction as an internal control (18 cycles). The pairs of oligonucleotides, 5′-TGCTACTTCATCGACCCCAT-3′ and 5′-AAAGACCTCACCCTCCATCT-3′ for aggrecan; 5′-TACGGTGTCAGGGCCAGGATGC-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTCACCACGATCACCTCT-3′ for type II collagen; 5′-CGTGGATTACGTGGAGAGCTACAATG-3′ and 5′-GGGTCTTCCTCCACACAGAT-3′ for matrilin-1; 5′-CAGGAAAACCTGGACAGCAG-3′ and 5′-ACCCTTAGGACCATTGAGAC-3′ for type X; 5′-ACTCCCAAAACCGACGTGCA-3′ and 5′-CGTCTTGATGTGCGTTCGCT-3′ for Sox9; and 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′ and 5′-GTCAAGGCCGAGAATGGGAA-3′, for GAPDH were used as primers for the PCR. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and transferred to NytranN membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled mouse aggrecan cDNA,32P-labeled mouse type II collagen cDNA,32P-labeled matrilin-1 cDNA, 32P-labeled mouse type X collagen cDNA, 32P-labeled mouse Sox9 cDNA, and 32P-labeled mouse GAPDH cDNA as described previously (13Nakamasu K. Kawamoto T. Shen M. Gotoh O. Teramoto M. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 258-264Google Scholar). The membranes were exposed to BioMax x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. The quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system instrument and software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The first-strand cDNA prepared by RT-PCR reaction was amplified using 5′-GGAGCTGGCATTCGTCCTT-3′ and 5′-GTTCCTTGATGAGCTGGACACA-3′ for mouse MTf. The amplified cDNA was quantified using 6FAM-TCTGCGTCCAGGGCAACTCCG-TAMRA for mouse MTf. For an internal control, mouse β-actin cDNA was amplified using 5′-ACGGCCAGGTCATCATCACTATTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGA-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The amplified cDNA was quantified using VIC-CAACGAGCGGTTCCGATGCCC-TAMRA for mouse β-actin. Cells were maintained in 0.5 ml of Medium A in 16-mm dishes for 16 days. The cultures were exposed for 6 h to 5 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate in Medium A. Proteoglycan synthesis was monitored by measuring the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into material precipitated with cetylpyridinium chloride after treatment with Pronase E (protease type XIV; Sigma) as described previously (23Kato Y. Nomura Y. Daikuhara Y. Nasu N. Tsuji M. Asada A. Suzuki F. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 130: 73-81Google Scholar). DNA content was determined using a fluorescent DNA quantitation kit (Bio-Rad). Cell layers were fixed with ethanol for 20 min and washed two times with PBS and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue solution for 20 min and then washed five times with PBS. The cell layers were washed with 50% ethanol and then with 30% ethanol and were washed five times with PBS and dried up. Cells were maintained in Medium A in 16-mm dishes for 23 days in the absence of insulin. Cell layers were washed with PBS and then incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with 2 mg/ml Pronase E (protease type XIV; Sigma) in 0.2m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5 mmCaCl2. Uronic acid was determined by the method of Bitter and Muir (24Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Google Scholar). The growth rate was estimated using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Experiments were performed at least in triplicate and expressed as mean ± S.D. The student'st test was used for statistical analysis. To examine a relationship between the MTf level and the degree of chondrogenic differentiation, ATDC5 cells were exposed to BMP-2 or TGF-β in the medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of insulin at 10 μg/ml. At a high concentration, insulin activates IGF-I receptors. The incubation with BMP-2 or TGF-β for 4 days increased the number of spherical or polygonal cells, and this effect was increased further in the presence of insulin (Fig. 1A). BMP-2 also increased the expression of aggrecan and type II collagen, and this effect was increased in the presence of insulin (Fig. 1B). TGF-β alone had little effect on the expression of aggrecan or type II collagen. However, TGF-β enhanced the expression of aggrecan and type II collagen in the presence of insulin. In these cells, BMP-2 and TGF-β increased the MTf mRNA level within 4 days 25- to 30-fold and 3- to 5-fold, respectively, and insulin increased the effect of TGF-β (12-fold) (Fig. 1C). Insulin alone increased the MTf mRNA level to a lesser extent. Insulin increased the MTf mRNA level markedly only 6 days after adding the hormone (13Nakamasu K. Kawamoto T. Shen M. Gotoh O. Teramoto M. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 258-264Google Scholar). BMP-2 had the greatest effect on MTf expression. Insulin partly suppressed the BMP-2-dependent MTf expression in repeated studies (Fig. 1C) (data not shown). The high MTf level in BMP plus insulin-exposed cells may be sufficient for chondrogenic differentiation. The BMP-2 stimulation of MTf mRNA expression could be observed within 24 h (Fig. 1D). The degree of MTf expression correlated roughly with that of chondrogenic differentiation, except that insulin suppressed the BMP-induced MTf expression. In the medium containing 5% serum, insulin, BMP-2, or TGF-β had a marginal effect on the Sox9 mRNA level because of a high basal Sox9 level (Fig. 1E). However, at a low serum concentration (0.5%), insulin, BMP-2, or TGF-β increased this level 2- to 10-fold. The 5% serum-enhanced expression of Sox9 alone was insufficient to induce chondrogenic differentiation in ATDC5 cultures; no differentiation was observed in the presence of 5% serum in the absence of added growth factors. If the growth factor-induced MTf is involved functionally in chondrogenic differentiation, forced expression of rabbit MTf in mouse ATDC5 cells should modulate chondrogenic differentiation in the absence of growth factors. To examine this hypothesis, we constructed pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) expression vectors containing the entire coding region of rabbit MTf cDNA under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. We transfected the MTf expression vector into mouse ATDC5 cells. Individual colonies were isolated, and the expression of MTf was examined by Northern blotting and immunoblotting. All clones transfected with the MTf expression vector showed the expression of MTf mRNA at high levels (data not shown). Five clones (M1, M4, M5, M6, and M8) had a high protein level of MTf, and three clones (m2, m3, and m7) had a low level (see Fig. 2A and Table I). In all clones, the protein level of MTf was lower (< 10%) than that in chondrocytes isolated from resting cartilage or the growth plate of adult rabbits (Fig. 2A).Table IEffects of forced expression of MTf on chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cellsCloneRabbit MTf level (Western blotting)Change in cell shape35SO4 uptakeAggrecanType II collagenWild−−−−−Pc1−−−−−Pc2−−−−−Pc3−−−−−M1++++++++++m2+++++m3+++/−++++M4++++++++++M5++++++++++++M6+++−−+++m7+++++−M8+++++/−+++++ Open table in a new tab To determine whether MTf is expressed on the surface of transfected cells, we examined the cell surface MTf level using a flow cytometer. As we expected, ATDC5 cells transfected with a rabbit MTf expression vector were stained with anti-rabbit MTf mAb2 but not with control IgG (Fig. 2B). This demonstrated that rabbit MTf could be expressed stably on the cell surface of mouse ATDC5 cells. In contrast, MTf was not detectable on the cell surface of the cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2B). Most of M1, M4, M5, and M8 cells (83–96%) stained with mAb2, whereas only 58% of M6 cells showed positive staining (Fig. 2B). The pattern of MTf expression in M6 cells differed from that in the other M cells (Fig. 2B). Parental ATDC5 cells, as well as cells transfected with the empty vector (Pc1, Pc2, and Pc3) showed the fibroblastic appearance throughout the whole culture period (see Fig. 3 and Table I). However, M1, M4, M5, and M8 cells underwent cell-shape change from fibroblastic to spherical/polygonal cells by day 23. Such cell-shape change was less prominent in m2, m3, M6, and m7 cultures. The level of [35S]sulfate incorporation into glycosaminoglycans was significantly higher in five MTf-expressing clones (M1, m2, M4, M5, and m7) than in wild type ATDC5 cultures on day 16 (see Fig. 4A and Table I). Furthermore, all MTf-expressing cultures except for M6 were stained more intensely with toluidine blue than control cultures (wild type, Pc1, and Pc2) on day 16 (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, the content of uronic acid-containing glycosaminoglycans (proteoglycans) was higher in MTf-expressing cultures than in control cultures on day 23 (Fig. 4C). In addition, forced expression of MTf induced aggrecan mRNA expression in all clones except for M6, and induced type II collagen mRNA in all clones except for m7. Matrilin-1, another chondrocyte marker, was expressed in Pc1, Pc2, and Pc3 at low levels, whereas it was expressed at high levels in most MTf-expressing clones (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that forced expression of MTf enhanced chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells depending upon the MTf level (Table I). M6 cells showed type II collagen and matrilin-1 syntheses but not aggrecan synthesis. Most M6 cells did not show the spherical phenotype. The reason by which M6 cells did not show aggrecan synthesis or the spherical phenotype is unknown. We did re-sequence rabbit MTf expressing in M6 cells and found no mutation. However, flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of M6 cells (58%) that stained with anti-rabbit MTf mAb2 was lower than that of M1, M4, M5, or M8 cells (83–96%) (Fig. 2B). The MTf expression pattern was different between M6 and the other M cells. The presence of M6 cells without MTf on the cell surface (∼42%) may suppress aggrecan synthesis and the expression of the spherical phenotype. ATDC5 cells expressing MTf at a high level (M5) and empty-vector integrated cells (Pc1) became confluent on day 4. The MTf-expressing cells started to form cartilage-like nodules on day 15 (Fig. 6A). The cells in the nodules exhibited the spherical phenotype. Most cells in M5 cultures became spherical on day 25. In M5 cultures, aggrecan, and type II collagen mRNA levels were low on day 5 and then increased with time, reaching a plateau on day 15 (Fig. 6B). The type X collagen mRNA level became detectable on day 15 and then increased with time until day 25. In contrast, aggrecan, type II collagen, and type X collagen mRNAs or spherical chondrocytes were hardly detected in control cultures during the whole culture period. In both M5 and Pc1 cultures, Sox9 mRNA was expressed at high and low levels on days 5–15 and days 20–25, respectively (Fig. 6B). To examine whether MTf expression is necessary for chondrogenic differentiation, the antisense-mouse MTf cDNA was expressed in ATDC5 cells under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. In three independent studies, we isolated more than 20 Zeocin-resistant clones. However, Northern blot analysis revealed that no clones except for A5 showed the expression of antisense-mouse MTf RNA (data not shown). The expression of antisense MTf RNA may inhibit clonal growth or survival of ATDC5 cells. Interestingly, the antisense MTf RNA-expressing cells (A5) hardly underwent chondrogenic differentiation even in the presence of insulin, whereas other clones, as well as parental ATDC5 cells, became chondrocytes in the presence of insulin. In the presence of insulin, the aggrecan mRNA level was far lower (<10%) in A5 cells than in parental ATDC5 cells (data not shown). Because we could not obtain other clones expressing the antisense-MTf RNA, we used anti-rabbit MTf mAb2 to modulate the effect of rabbit MTf on the cell surface. When M4 or M5 cells were exposed to mAb2 in confluent cultures, the expression of the spherical phenotype was suppressed markedly on day 15 (Fig. 7A). This antibody also decreased [35S]sulfate incorporation into glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 7B) and aggrecan and type X collagen mRNA levels on day 15 (Fig. 7C). The antibody treatment was not toxic. The inhibition by mAb2 became less prominent with increase in the culture period even in the continuous presence of mAb2, perhaps because of the accumulation of the extracellular matrix, which may inhibit the access of the antibody to the cell surface. To demonstrate that the effect of mAb2 is reversible, M4 cells were exposed to mAb2 for 8 days (days 4–12) and then incubated for 8 days without antibody until day 20. These cells re-expressed the spherical phenotype and type X collagen mRNA on day 20 (Fig. 7D). Anti-rabbit MTf polyclonal Ab1 also suppressed the cell-shape change in M4 and M5 cultures (data not shown). These findings suggest that MTf expressed on the cell surface is involved in the enhancement of chondrocyte differentiation. The effect of MTf-forced expression on aggrecan expression was less than that of insulin on day 15 (the matrix-forming stage) (Fig. 8A). The effect of MTf-forced expression on type II collagen expression was also less than that of insulin (Fig. 8A). On day 5, insulin decreased aggrecan mRNA expression in M4 and M5 cultures (Fig. 8B). The degree of inhibition varied from 20 to 70% in repeated studies (data not shown). However, insulin increased aggrecan mRNA expression in M4 and M5 cultures on days 10, 15, 20, and 25 (Fig. 8, A and B). The forced expression of MTf had little effect on the proliferation of ATDC5 cells, irrespective of the presence or absence of insulin (Fig. 8C). Mouse C3H10T1/2 cells have multilineage differentiation potential and show the expression of type II collagen only in pellet or micromass cultures exposed to TGF-β. They do not undergo chondrogenic differentiation in monolayer cultures even in the presence of TGF-β. MTf mRNA expression in C3H10T1/2 cells was very low (data not shown). To examine the role of MTf in chondrogenic differentiation, we isolated C3H10T1/2 clones (T1-T4) transfected with the rabbit MTf expression vector (Fig. 9A). The rabbit MTf level in these clones was similar to that in M5-ATDC5 cells. The forced expression of MTf induced aggrecan mRNA expression in all C3H10T1/2 clones and type II collagen mRNA in T1 and T3 clones in monolayer cultures exposed to TGF-β (Fig. 9B), whereas these expressions were undetectable in parental and empty vector-integrated C3H10T1/2 cells. The forced expression did not induce the expression of the spherical phenotype in T2, T3, and T4 cells. T1 cells alone showed the polygonal/spherical phenotype (data not shown). The marked stimulation of MTf expression by insulin/IGF-I, BMP-2, and TGF-β, which are essential for chondrogenic differentiation, suggests the involvement of MTf in the differentiation program. BMP-2 elicited the greatest stimulation of MTf expression in ATDC5 cells, whereas TGF-β had less effect. Insulin also enhanced MTf expression. The high MTf expression in chondrocytes may depend upon the insulin/IGF-I and BMP/TGF-β-signaling pathways. To test a hypothesis that MTf is involved in chondrogenic differentiation, we used ATDC5 cells expressing rabbit MTf and anti-rabbit MTf antibodies. In the absence of added growth factors, ATDC5 cells expressing rabbit MTf underwent chondrogenic differentiation as indicated by the synthesis and accumulation of cartilage-matrix macromolecules and the spherical appearance, whereas wild type and empty vector-integrated ATDC5 cells did not show any traits of chondrogenic differentiation except for the expression of Sox9. The degree of chondrogenic differentiation in the MTf-expressing cells depended roughly upon the expression level of rabbit MTf (TableI). The protein level of MTf was more than 10-fold higher in chondrocytes isolated from adult rabbits than in the rabbit MTf-expressing ATDC5 cells. The MTf mRNA level in chondrocytes was comparable with that in SK-MEL melanoma cells (data not shown). SK-MEL cells express 106-107 MTf molecules per cell (26Brown J.P. Nishiyama K. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 539-546Google Scholar), whereas fibroblasts express 103 MTf molecules per cells (27Casellas P. Brown J.P. Gros O. Gros P. Hellstrom I. Jansen F.K. Poncelet P. Roncucci R. Vidal H. Hellstrom K.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1982; 30: 437-443Google Scholar). This high MTf level in chondrocytes may modulate growth factor signaling pathways. The effect of the forced expression of MTf in ATDC5 cells on chondrogenic differentiation was less than that of insulin. This may be because of the lower level of rabbit MTf in the MTf-overexpressing ATDC5 cells than in adult chondrocytes. It is also likely that MTf expression mediates only part of the growth factor actions in chondrogenic cells. The forced expression of MTf in ATDC5 cells enhanced type II collagen, aggrecan, matrilin-1, and type X collagen. Type II collagen is expressed in chondrocytes and a few non-cartilaginous tissues during embryogenesis and development of the skeleton. Type II procollagen is synthesized in the perichondrium as two different forms (type IIA and type IIB) generated by alternative splicing of exon 2 in the precursor mRNA transcript. These two forms are expressed spatially during development with the type IIB mRNA expressed primarily by chondrocytes, whereas type IIA form is expressed in chondroprogenitor cells (28Sandell L.J. Morris N. Robbins J.R. Goldring M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1307-1319Google Scholar). The forced expression of MTf increased both type IIA and IIB collagen expressions, although it had much greater effects on type IIB collagen mRNA expression (data not shown). Aggrecan is also the major component in the cartilage matrix. Matrilin-1 is synthesized in a cartilage-characteristic manner and binds to aggrecan and type II collagen (29Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 367-375Google Scholar, 30Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Google Scholar, 31Hauser N. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32247-32252Google Scholar). Matrilin-1 may be an adhesion factor for chondrocytes (32Makihira S. Yan W. Ohno S. Kawamoto T. Fujimoto K. Okimura A. Yoshida E. Noshiro M. Hamada T. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 2741: 1417-1423Google Scholar). Aggrecan and matrilin-1 mRNAs were also expressed at higher levels in the MTf-expressing cells. The expression of type X collagen, a marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes, was also induced in the MTf-expressing clones at a late stage. Furthermore, anti-MTf antibodies suppressed the expressions of aggrecan and type X collagen in MTf-expressing ATDC5 cells. These findings suggest that MTf facilitates the differentiation of prechondrogenic cells from early to terminal stages. C3H10T1/2 cells had far less chondrogenic potential than ATDC5 cells, whereas C3H10T1/2 cells had much greater osteogenic and adipogenic potential than ATDC5 cells. In C3H10T1/2 cells exposed to TGF-β, type II collagen was induced only in pellet or mass cultures but not in monolayer cultures (25Denker A.E. Nicoll S.B. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 25-34Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in monolayer cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells, the forced expression of MTf induced the expression of aggrecan and/or type II collagen. Only one clone (T1) exhibited the spherical/polygonal phenotype. Because the spherical cell shape is the hallmark of chondrocytes, MTf expression alone does not seem to be sufficient to commit pluripotent mesenchymal cells to the chondrocyte lineage. The mechanism by which MTf enhances chondrogenic differentiation is not known. Because chondrocytes secrete transferrin at high levels, MTf is unlikely to play a role in iron uptake. In the absence of transferrin, MTf enhances iron uptake via a transferrin receptor-independent mechanism (33Kennard M.L. Richardson D.R. Gabathuler R. Ponka P. Jefferies W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4178-4186Google Scholar). However, MTf cannot receive iron from transferrin, and thus MTf does not play a role in iron uptake in physiological conditions (12Richardson D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1290-1298Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of transferrin had no effect on chondrogenic differentiation of wild type and MTf-overexpressing ATDC5 cells (data not shown). Thus, MTf seems to work independently of transferrin and iron uptake. It is hypothesized that MTf may have matrix metalloprotease-like activity and inhibit lipid peroxidation (12Richardson D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1290-1298Google Scholar). However, these activities of MTf cannot account for the enhancement of chondrogenic differentiation. The anti-MTf antibodies including mAb2 and polyclonal Ab1 suppressed chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells. The antibodies may compete with an unknown MTf ligand secreted by chondrogenic cells or suppress the interaction between MTf and other signaling molecules on the cell surface. In contrast to these antibodies, some antibodies (polyclonal Ab4) against rabbit MTf enhanced aggrecan synthesis and the expression of the spherical phenotype by poorly differentiated rabbit chondrocytes. 3R. Oda, K. Suardita, K. Fujimoto, H. Pan, W. Yan, A. Shimazu, H. Shintani, and Y. Kato, unpublished data. These findings suggest that cross-linking of MTf modulates chondrogenic differentiation. MTf is linked to the outer surface of the plasma membrane via GPI anchor (4Rose T.M. Plowman G.D. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Hellstrom K.E. Brown J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1261-1265Google Scholar). Most GPI-anchor proteins are concentrated in lipid raft, which plays an important role in signal transduction (34Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 35Marmor M.D. Julius M. Blood. 2001; 98: 1489-1497Google Scholar). Several GPI-anchor proteins have been shown to modulate the growth factor or cytokine- or antigen-induced proliferation/differentiation of various cells including lymphocytes (36Robinson P.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 35-41Google Scholar, 37Horejsi V. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Drbal K. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 63: 63-73Google Scholar, 38Horejsi V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Stockinger H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 356-361Google Scholar). In MTf-overexpressing ATDC5 cultures, insulin suppressed aggrecan expression in the early stage but enhanced it in the later stages. MTf may modulate the growth factor signaling pathways depending on stages. In conclusion, MTf is a target for insulin/IGF-I, BMP-2, and TGF-β and mediates the effect of the growth factor on chondrogenic differentiation at least partly. This is the first observation that a GPI-anchor protein is involved functionally in the differentiation program of chondrogenic cells.
