https://openalex.org/W2013854174,"The atomic force microscope (AFM) can be used to image the surface of both conductors and nonconductors even if they are covered with water or aqueous solutions. An AFM was used that combines microfabricated cantilevers with a previously described optical lever system to monitor deflection. Images of mica demonstrate that atomic resolution is possible on rigid materials, thus opening the possibility of atomic-scale corrosion experiments on nonconductors. Images of polyalanine, an amino acid polymer, show the potential of the AFM for revealing the structure of molecules important in biology and medicine. Finally, a series of ten images of the polymerization of fibrin, the basic component of blood clots, illustrate the potential of the AFM for revealing subtle details of biological processes as they occur in real time."

Biochemical assays confirmed a significant increase in the activity of this enzyme in both the caudate nucleus and putamen in postmortem brain tissue from patients with this disease. The resistance of these neurons suggests that the gene defect in Huntington's disease may be modifiable by the local biochemical environment. This finding may provide insight into the nature of the genetically programmed cell death that is a characteristic of the disease."

Contrary to its metabolically inert appearance, this peptide may have biological activity. To evaluate this possibility, a peptide ligand homologous to the first 28 residues of the beta-amyloid protein (beta 1-28) was tested in cultures of hippocampal pyramidal neurons for neurotrophic or neurotoxic effects. The beta 1-28 appeared to have neurotrophic activity because it enhanced neuronal survival under the culture conditions examined. This finding may help elucidate the sequence of events leading to plaque formation and neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1609961433,"The effects of acetaminophen and its major toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), have been investigated in hepatocytes isolated from 3-methylcholanthrene-pretreated and -untreated rats, respectively. The two compounds produced qualitatively similar changes although the quinone imine was toxic with shorter incubations periods and at lower doses. Both agents caused an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, assessed by phosphorylase a activity, which was accompanied by the concomitant appearance of plasma membrane blebs. A loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ was also observed. This disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis always preceded cell death. Studies with NAPQI showed that low doses were able to cause complete Ca2+ release from isolated liver mitochondria which was accompanied by pyridine nucleotide oxidation and preceded membrane damage. NAPQI also produced a rapid, dose-dependent depletion of both cytosolic and mitochondrial reduced glutathione as well as a loss of protein-bound SH groups. This loss of protein thiols may have been responsible for the observed inhibition of the high-affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity of the plasma membrane fraction isolated from NAPQI-treated cells. In addition, NAPQI inhibited microsomal Ca2+ uptake which would further contribute to the elevation in cytosolic Ca2+. Our results suggest that acetaminophen and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine exert their cytotoxic effects via a disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis secondary to the depletion of soluble and protein-bound thiols. This mechanism may prove to be of general applicability to a variety of hepatotoxins."

https://openalex.org/W1492555913,"The strategies and methods used by the QUEST system for two-dimensional gel analysis are described, and the performance of the system is evaluated. Radiolabeled proteins, resolved on two-dimensional gels and detected using calibrated exposures to film, are quantified in units of disintegrations per minute or as a fraction of the total protein radioactivity applied to the gel. Spot quantitation and resolution of overlapping spots is performed by two-dimensional gaussian fitting. Pattern matching is carried out for groups of gels called matchsets, and within each matchset every gel is matched to every other gel. During the matching process, spots are automatically added to each pattern at positions where unmatched spots were detected in other patterns. This results in enhanced accuracy for both spot detection and for matching. The spot fitting procedure is repeated after matching. Tests show that up to 97% of spots in each pattern can be matched and that fewer than 1% of the spots are matched inconsistently. Approximately 2000 proteins are detected from typical gels. Of these 1600 are high quality spots. Tests to measure the coefficient of variation of spot quantitation versus spot quality show that the average coefficient of variation for high quality spots is 21%. The intensities of the detected proteins range from 4 to 20,000 ppm of total protein synthesis. The QUEST analysis system has been used to build a quantitative database for the proteins of normal and transformed REF52 cells, as presented in the accompanying reports (Garrels, J., and Franza, B. R., Jr. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5283-5298, 5299-5312)."

https://openalex.org/W1983816460,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was converted from a protein with a short intracellular half-life in mammalian cells to a stable protein by truncating 37 residues at its carboxyl terminus. Cells expressing wild-type protein lost ODC activity with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. Cells expressing the truncated protein, however, retained full activity for at least 4 hours. Pulse-chase experiments in which immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis were used confirmed the stabilizing effect of the truncation. Thus, a carboxyl-terminal domain is responsible for the rapid intracellular degradation of murine ODC."
https://openalex.org/W1950671087,"A new binding protein which recognizes the phosphomannosyl recognition marker of lysosomal enzymes has been isolated from P388D1 macrophages which lack the 215-kDa Man-6-P receptor. This receptor was detergent-solubilized from total membranes and purified by chromatography on a lysosomal enzyme affinity column. An identical protein was purified from bovine liver using a two-step procedure which is based on the difference in ion requirement and ligand specificity of the new Man-6-P binding protein and the previously characterized 215-kDa Man-6-P receptor. After detergent solubilization of membranes, both receptors were co-purified on a phosphomannan-Sepharose affinity column run in the presence of MnCl2 and then were separated using a Dictyostelium discoideum lysosomal enzyme-Affi-Gel column which, in the absence of MnCl2, retains only the 215-kDa Man-6-P receptor. The new Man-6-P receptor binds efficiently to phosphomannosyl monoester-containing ligands when MnCl2 is present. This binding is specifically inhibited by Man-6-P or by low pH. The cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor has a subunit molecular size of 46 kDa and appears to be an oligomer composed of three subunits. The receptor contains both high mannose (or hybrid)- and complex-type oligosaccharide units on the basis of sensitivity to digestion with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F. Radioimmunoassays carried out with two different antibodies demonstrate that the 46-kDa cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor and the 215-kDa cation-independent Man-6-P receptor not only differ in their properties but are also immunologically distinct."

https://openalex.org/W151446319,"Exposure of cultured human epidermal keratinocytes to the protein kinase C (Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase)-activating phorbol esters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or 4-beta-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate markedly enhanced accumulation of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) mRNA and secretion of TGF-alpha protein. The nonactivating phorbol ester, 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, had no effect. In the absence of exogenous growth factors, confluent cultures of keratinocytes express low or undetectable levels of TGF-alpha mRNA and protein. While TPA and epidermal growth factor treatment of keratinocyte cultures deprived of growth factors both induced TGF-alpha mRNA expression, maximum induction by TPA is 5-fold greater than epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, the addition of epidermal growth factor did not enhance TPA-mediated induction of TGF-alpha mRNA expression. Under these experimental conditions, TPA increased levels of secreted TGF-alpha protein by 20-fold at 24 h. Concentration dependence and kinetic studies of TGF-alpha expression showed that TPA (greater than or equal to 1 ng/ml) induced accumulation of TGF-alpha mRNA with an optimum concentration of 10 ng/ml. TGF-alpha mRNA expression increased within 1 h following TPA treatment (10 ng/ml) and peaked at 5 h. At 24 h, TPA-treated cultures still expressed elevated levels of TGF-alpha mRNA (1.7-fold). Protein secretion into the medium was enhanced 2-fold (5 h) to 3-fold (24 h) by TPA treatment of keratinocyte cultures containing growth factors. Prolonged pretreatment (24 h) of keratinocyte cultures with TPA caused marked desensitization of TGF-alpha mRNA expression to repeated stimulation by phorbol ester. The synthetic diacylglycerol, 1,2-sn-dioctanoylglycerol, enhanced levels of TGF-alpha transcription and secretion of TGF-alpha protein. The rate of TGF-alpha mRNA accumulation peaked and declined earlier for 1,2-sn-dioctanoylglycerol compared to TPA. 1,2-sn-Dioctanoylglycerol (50 micrograms/ml) increased production and secretion of TGF-alpha protein, but less than TPA treatment. An inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, also inhibited 1,2-sn-dioctanoylglycerol-mediated accumulation of TGF-alpha mRNA. Cycloheximide failed to inhibit TGF-alpha mRNA expression induced by TPA and, when added alone to keratinocyte cultures, significantly enhanced TGF-alpha mRNA accumulation. Actinomycin D abrogated transcriptional activation of TGF-alpha mRNA by TPA. These studies suggest that activation of protein kinase C by active phorbol esters or diacylglycerols is responsible, at least in part, for TGF-alpha gene expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2090582807,"The in vivo synthesis and assembly of human small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) have been studied using pulse/chase analysis. Antibodies derived from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) recognize distinguishable subsets of pulse-labeled snRNP peptides. These antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate sucrose gradient fractionated pulse-labeled and pulse/chased snRNP proteins. The results indicate that assembly of the U RNA-containing snRNPs is a multistep process involving prior assembly of an RNA-free 6S core particle. This precursor contains snRNP peptides D, E, F, and G, which are common to all the different U RNA-containing particles. Furthermore, a posttranslational modification of one of the U1 snRNP-specific peptides has been observed, and the kinetics of this process indicates that the modification occurs after particle assembly. Functional and structural implications of a protein core for snRNP particles are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1517536901,"The construction and analysis of protein databases using the QUEST system is described, and the REF52 protein database is presented. A protein database provides the means to store and compare quantitative and descriptive data for up to 2000 proteins from many experiments that employ computer-analyzed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The QUEST system provides the tools to manage, analyze, and communicate these data. The REF52 database contains experiments with normal and transformed rat cell lines. In this report, many of the proteins on the REF52 map are identified by name, by subcellular localization, and by mode of post-translational modification. The quantitative experiments analyzed and compared here include 1) a study of the quantitative reproducibility of the analysis system, 2) a study of the clonal reproducibility of REF52 cells, 3) a study of growth-related changes in REF52 cells, and 4) a study of the effects of labeling cells for varying lengths of time. Of the proteins analyzed from REF52 cells, 10% are nuclear, 6% are phosphoproteins, and 4% are mannose-labeled glycoproteins. The mannose-labeled proteins are more prominent in patterns from quiescent cells, while the synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins is generally repressed at quiescence. A small set of proteins, selected for elevated rates of synthesis is generally repressed at quiescence. A small set of proteins, selected for elevated rates of synthesis in quiescent versus proliferating cells includes one of the tropomyosin isoforms, a myosin light chain isoform, and several prominent glycoproteins. These proteins are thought to be characteristic of the differentiated state of untransformed REF52 cells. Proteins induced early versus late after refeeding quiescent cells show very different patterns of growth regulation. These studies lay the foundations of the REF52 database and provide information needed to interpret the experiments with transformed REF52 cells, which are reported in the accompanying paper (Garrels, J., and Franza, B.

https://openalex.org/W1546941295,"Two-dimensional crystalline arrays of Ca2+-ATPase molecules develop in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles exposed to Ca2+ or lanthanide ions. The Ca2+- or lanthanide-induced crystals are presumed to represent the E1 conformation of the Ca2+-ATPase, and their crystal form is clearly different from the earlier described E2 crystals induced by Na3VO4 in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (Taylor, K. A., Dux, L., and Martonosi, A. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 174, 193-204). Analysis of the crystalline arrays by negative staining or freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals obliquely oriented rows of particles corresponding to individual Ca2+-ATPase molecules. Computer analysis of the negatively stained lanthanide-induced crystalline Ca2+-ATPase arrays shows that the molecules are arranged in a P1 lattice. The pear-shaped profiles of Ca2+-ATPase molecules seen in projection in the density maps are similar to those seen in vanadate-induced crystals. The space group and unit cell dimensions of the E1 crystals are consistent with Ca2+-ATPase monomers as structural units, while the vanadate-induced E2 crystals form by lateral aggregation of chains of Ca2+-ATPase dimers. The transition between the E1 and E2 conformations may involve a shift in the monomer-oligomer equilibrium of the Ca2+-ATPase. The formation of E1 crystals by PrCl3 is promoted by inside negative membrane potential, presumably through stabilization of the E1 conformation of the enzyme. Cleavage of the Ca2+-ATPase by trypsin into two major fragments (A and B) did not interfere with the Ca2+- or the Pr3+-induced crystallization."

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or collagen was found to increase platelet histamine content in parallel with promotion of aggregation. Inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) suppressed both aggregation and the elevation of histamine content, whereas DPPE inhibited aggregation only. In saponin-permeabilized platelets, added histamine reversed the inhibition by DPPE or HDC inhibitors on aggregation induced by PMA or collagen. The results indicate a role for histamine as an intracellular messenger, which in platelets promotes aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1597958613,"Extracellular calcium at millimolar concentrations inhibits collective motility of ejaculated ram spermatozoa. In untreated cells, or when motility was made dependent upon glycolytic activity, there is very small inhibition, but when motility was made dependent upon mitochondrial respiration there is very high inhibition in motility by increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Quercetin, which inhibits (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in isolated plasma membranes, also inhibits motility mainly in cells that have been made dependent upon glycolytic activity, but there is also inhibition in untreated cells. When motility was made dependent upon mitochondrial activity, there is no inhibition but rather some stimulation in motility by quercetin. The inhibitory effect of quercetin is enhanced by increasing Ca2+ concentration in the medium. Quercetin also inhibits uptake of calcium into the cells, in a mechanism by which a calcium channel is involved. This inhibition is high only when the glycolysis is inhibited in the cells. The rate of glycolysis is decreased by quercetin or ouabain, but their effects on motility are quite different. Based on these data, it appears that the plasma membrane (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase or the Ca2+ pump have a functional role in the regulation of spermatozoa motility. This motility regulation is functioning through mechanisms which include glycolytic activity and maintenance of intracellular calcium concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1987958817,"A theoretical analysis of the reptational motion of DNA in a gel that includes the effects of molecular fluctuations has been used to explain the main features found in experiments involving periodic inversion of the electric field. The resonance-like decrease of the electrophoretic mobility as a function of pulse duration is related to transient ""undershoots"" in the orientation of the molecule, in agreement with recent experimental data. These features arise from a delicate interplay of internal and center of mass motion of the molecules under pulsed field conditions, and are important for the separation of DNA molecules in the size range 0.2 to 10 million base pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1486054953,"The energy requirement for protein breakdown in Escherichia coli appears to be due to protease La, the lon gene product, which hydrolyzes proteins and ATP in a coupled process. This novel enzyme was investigated with small peptides, identified as substrates in the preceding manuscript. Although the degradation of proteins to acid-soluble material requires hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate, cleavage of small fluorogenic substrates, such as glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-methoxynaphthylamine, was found to require only binding of nucleotides to the enzyme. Nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP, slowly hydrolyzed nucleotides, and even inorganic triphosphate and pyrophosphate stimulate the breakdown of these peptides but not of large proteins such as casein or serum albumin. In addition, vanadate, an inhibitor of the enzyme's ATPase activity, prevents protein degradation, but vanadate does not inhibit and can even stimulate peptide hydrolysis. Degradation of natural oligopeptides or of small polypeptides (less than 10,000 Da) also does not require hydrolysis of the nucleotide. Furthermore, although protein substrates promote ATP cleavage, the fluorogenic peptides inhibit this process. Also, no evidence was obtained for phosphorylation of the protease or of the substrate during ATP hydrolysis. These findings suggest that protein breakdown involves a cyclical series of reactions: 1) ATP binds to the protease and activates it allosterically, thus allowing peptide bond cleavage; 2) the hydrolysis of ATP must occur subsequently and should prevent further peptide bond cleavage until additional nucleoside triphosphates are bound; 3) with proteins as substrates, this reaction cycle probably occurs repeatedly until small peptides are generated."

It was isolated from culture fluid of human kidney cells and subjected to chemical (CNBr) and proteolytic (lysyl endopeptidase) degradation. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to automated sequence analysis. Amino acid sequence of 85% of the 411 residues recovered in 17 peptides were found to be consistent with those of the A chain (157 amino acids) and B chain (253 amino acids) of human urokinase reported by Gunzler and co-workers (Gunzler, W.

It revealed the presence of Lys at position 158 in single-chain pro-urokinase through which the two polypeptide chains of human urokinase are unified into one molecule. In addition, firm evidence was found that upon activation by plasmin single-chain pro-urokinase is cleaved at the Lys-Ile bond between residues 158 and 159, resulting in the formation of a two-chain urokinase molecule held together by one disulfide linkage. These results indicate that the cleavage at the Lys-Ile bond between residues 158 and 159 is responsible for conformational change, appearance of enzyme activity and reduction of its high affinity for fibrin."
https://openalex.org/W2118363290,"all-trans-Retinoic acid is a potent inducer in vitro of the differentiation of the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL60 and of fresh cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The recent discovery of nuclear retinoic acid receptors provides a basis for understanding how retinoic acid acts at the genetic level. We have now found that retinoic acid is incorporated into HL60 cells in a form that is not removed by extraction with CHC13:CHaOH. About 90% of this labeled retinoic acid is trichloroacetic acid-soluble after digestion with proteinase K or after hydrolysis with either NHzOH or CHsOH:KOH under mild conditions. Methyl retinoate is the major product of hydrolysis with CH30H:KOH. These results are consistent with retinoylation of protein with the formation of an ester, probably thioester, bond. The extent of the retinoylation of HL60 protein is dependent on both time and retinoic acid concentration. A major fraction of the retinoylation is of a protein that has a molecular mass of 55 kDa after reduction with dithiothreitol. On two-dimensional gels, the retinoylated protein has a PI of about 4.9 and a molecular mass of 55-60 kDa. These characteristics and its localization in the cell nucleus are consistent with retinoylation of the HL60 nuclear retinoic acid receptor or a closely related protein."

Previous studies have described a casein kinase activity in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and this organelle as the site of xylose addition to the protein core of proteoglycans. We now report the translocation in vitro of ATP into the lumen of rat liver and mammary gland Golgi vesicles which are sealed and have the same membrane topographical orientation as in vivo. The entire ATP molecule was translocated into the lumen of the Golgi vesicles; this was established by using ATP radiolabeled with tritium in the adenine and gamma-32P. Translocation was temperature dependent and saturable, with an apparent Km of 0.9 microM and Vmax of 58 pmol/mg protein/min. Preliminary evidence suggests that translocation of ATP into the vesicles' lumen is coupled to exit of AMP from the lumen. Following translocation of ATP into the lumen of the vesicles, proteins were phosphorylated."

https://openalex.org/W2143123719,"Abstract To examine the functional organization of the human triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) promoter, deletion, insertion, and linker scanning mutations were introduced into the TPI promoter of hybrid TPI/beta-globin genes. These genes were transiently expressed in mouse L and human HeLa cells, and the effect of each mutation on the frequency and position of transcription initiation was assayed by S1 nuclease transcript mapping. Multiple positive regulatory elements reside between positions -595 and +1 in L cells and -920 and -7 in HeLa cells and coordinately promote maximum hybrid gene transcription. These elements include an array of GC boxes (positions -126 to -48) that variably conform to the consensus Sp1-binding site, and a canonical TATA box (positions -27 to -21) that is essential for detectable levels of transcription. In an additive yet position-dependent fashion, the GC boxes function in cis to the TATA box to control both the frequency and position of transcription initiation. Additional positive elements reside upstream of position -131 and are required for full promoter function. Also, an inhibitory element(s) residing between position -7200 and either -2800 in L cells or -920 in HeLa cells reduces transcription approximately 7-fold relative to the level of transcription achieved with the maximally active promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1857869130,"Lysogenic development by bacteriophage lambda is known to require the coordinate expression of two phage operons. Coordinate control is achieved by a positive regulatory mechanism which activates transcription from the promoters of these operons, PRE and PI. The positive effector is the phage regulatory protein cII. We now identify and characterize a third cII-dependent transcription unit on phage lambda, which is positioned in the middle of the Q regulatory gene and has an anti-Q orientation. We demonstrate the cII-dependent function of this promoter and precisely map its 5' transcription start-site both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, we show that cII binding and transcription activation at PaQ occur at essentially the same cII levels as those required for PRE and PI activation, and that all three promoters respond to cII at the same time following phage infection. In addition, DNase protection studies demonstrate that cII selectively interacts with the same TTGCN6TTGC DNA sequence repeat in the -35 region of PaQ which cII interacts with at both PRE and PI. We find that cII also binds other TTGCN6TTGC repeat sequences on lambda but binding at these sites does not lead to productive transcription. We conclude that PaQ functions in concert with PRE and PI to regulate the lysogenic growth response of phage lambda. We presume that the PaQ directed anti-sense Q RNA transcript functions to down-regulate the expression of the Q gene, which is needed for the expression of all phage late genes during lytic growth."
https://openalex.org/W1560835792,"The Escherichia coli dnaE gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of DNA polymerase III (pol III) holoenzyme, has been cloned in a plasmid containing the PL promoter of phage lambda and thermally induced to overproduce the alpha subunit. In cells carrying this plasmid (pKH167), the alpha subunit was amplified, after heat induction, to a level of about 0.2% of the total cellular protein. Polymerase activity was assayed in three ways: (i) gap-filling by pol III holoenzyme and subassemblies of it, (ii) the extensive replication of a primed, single-stranded DNA circle only by pol III holoenzyme, and (iii) complementation of a crude, inactive pol III holoenzyme (temperature-sensitive dnaE mutant fraction) in replication of a primed, single-stranded DNA circle. Amplification of the alpha subunit raised the polymerase level 10-fold in assay (i), indicative of the dependence of pol III gap-filling activity on this polypeptide; pol III holoenzyme activity remained unaffected (assay (ii)), but the complementation activity was raised 5-fold (assay (iii)). Thus, the elevated alpha subunit (free or in a subassembly form) can substitute in vitro for a defective alpha subunit in pol III holoenzyme, but cannot increase the in vivo level of about eight pol III holoenzyme molecules per cell. This low level of pol III holoenzyme is fixed in wild type cells (bearing no plasmid) despite the presence of a 5-fold excess of the alpha subunit, as inferred from the various assays. These results suggest that the low level of pol III holoenzyme is determined by a factor or factors other than the level of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1605863475,"A quantitative determination of collagen expression was carried out in cultured chondrocytes obtained from a tissue that undergoes endochondral bone replacement (ventral vertebra) and one that does not (caudal sterna). The short collagen, type X is only expressed in the former while the other short collagen type IX, was primarily expressed in the latter. These two tissues also differ in that vertebral chondrocytes express moderate levels of both type I procollagen mRNAs which were translated into full length procollagen chains both in vivo and in vitro, while caudal sternal chondrocytes did not. The percent of collagen synthesis was about 50% in both cell types, but sternal cells expressed twice as much collagen as vertebral cells even though type II procollagen was more efficiently processed to alpha-chains in vertebral chondrocytes than in sternal chondrocytes. The number of type II procollagen mRNA molecules/cell was found to be about 2300 in vertebral chondrocytes and about 8000 in sternal cells, in good agreement with the results reported by Kravis and Upholt (Kravis, D., and Upholt, W. B. (1985) Dev. Biol. 108, 164-172). There were about 630 copies of type I procollagen mRNAs with an alpha 1/alpha 2 ratio of 1.6 in vertebral chondrocytes compared with 5100 copies and an alpha 1/alpha 2 ratio of 2.2 in osteoblasts, and less than 40 copies in sternal cells. Since the rate of type I collagen chain synthesis was 50 times greater in osteoblasts than in vertebral cells, type I procollagen mRNAs were about six times less efficiently translated in vertebral cells than in osteoblasts. The type I mRNAs in vertebral chondrocytes were polyadenylated and had 5' ends that were identical in osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and myoblasts. Moreover, type I mRNAs isolated from vertebral chondrocytes were translated into full length preprocollagen chains in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Thus, chondrocytes isolated from cartilage tissues with different developmental fates differed quantitatively and qualitatively in total collagen synthesis, procollagen processing, and distribution of collagen types."
https://openalex.org/W2226068947,"Abstract Glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase catalyzes the conversion of glycinamide ribonucleotide and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to formylglycinamide ribonucleotide and tetrahydrofolate. The enzyme purified from the murine lymphoma cell line L5178Y also catalyzes two other de novo purine biosynthetic activities, glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase and aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase. The transformylase reaction shows a 1:1 stoichiometry for substrate utilization and an optimum rate between pH 7.9 and 8.3. Initial velocity and dead-end inhibition patterns indicate that the kinetic mechanism of the transformylation reaction is ordered-sequential, with 10-formyltetrahydrofolate binding first. alpha, beta-Hydroxyacetamide ribonucleotide (alpha, beta-N-(hydroxyacetyl)-D-ribofuranosylamine) is shown to be an inhibitor of the transformylase, competitive against glycinamide ribonucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1557907946,"Phosphorylation of the high mannose-type oligosaccharides attached to newly synthesized acid hydrolases occurs in two sequential steps within the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, and the products generated at the two sites differ with respect to the location of the phosphorylated mannose residue. To investigate the mechanism of this two-step phosphorylation, biosynthesis of the Man-6-P recognition marker was studied in class E Thy-1- and J774 cells metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose. Class E Thy-1- cells produce truncated high mannose oligosaccharides that lack 4 mannose residues from the alpha 1,6-branch of the core beta-linked mannose residue; three of the missing residues are potential phosphorylation sites. Acid hydrolases produced by these mutant cells were phosphorylated on the alpha 1,3-branch of the truncated oligosaccharide even when transport to the Golgi apparatus was inhibited. J774 cells produce normal high mannose oligosaccharides, but they secrete a large percentage of their newly synthesized acid hydrolases. The secreted enzymes contained primarily diphosphorylated units in which a phosphate was positioned to both the alpha 1,3- and alpha 1,6-branches of the core beta-linked mannose. J774 cells treated with deoxymannojirimycin continued to phosphorylate and to secrete acid hydrolases. The secreted hydrolases, however, contained only monophosphorylated oligosaccharides in which the phosphate was restricted to the alpha 1,6-branch. These results indicate that mannose residues within high mannose oligosaccharides impose constraints on the phosphorylation of their composite structures. We conclude that the two-step phosphorylation occurs as a result of a common phosphotransferase at both the pre-Golgi and Golgi locations and a change in the conformation of the oligosaccharides attached to the acid hydrolases through the action of Golgi-associated alpha-mannosidase I."
https://openalex.org/W1508797720,"Glycosomes are specialized organelles of trypanosomes which contain glycolytic enzymes as their major protein components in Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream form. In the glycosomes of the insect form of T. brucei, additional enzyme activities are found but have not yet been ascribed to a particular protein molecule. In this study, we report the characterization of a 60-kDa glycosomal protein (p60) encoded by a single copy gene which is transcribed into a mRNA of 2.9 kilobases. The gene codes for a protein of 472 amino acids with a molecular mass of 52.5 kDa, suggesting that the mRNA contains large untranslated regions of about 1.4 kilobases. Genomic DNA hybridizations have shown that the gene for p60 is confined to the family of Trypanosomatidae. Sequence comparison confirmed that p60 is not a member of a conserved protein family and does not belong to the group of glycolytic enzymes. p60 is expressed much more strongly in insect form than in bloodstream form trypanosomes. Thus, p60 is the first glycosomal protein observed whose expression is up-regulated during the transition of trypanosomes from the bloodstream to the insect form. The biochemical characterization of p60 demonstrated its capability to bind microtubules and membrane vesicles and to cross-link these structures. These properties might indicate a function in linking glycosomes to the microtubules of the trypanosomal cytoskeleton. However, proteinase K digestion experiments indicate that p60 is not exposed at the outer surface of the glycosomal membrane. The biological role of the microtubule-binding capability of p60 remains unclear, whereas its membrane binding may be of physiological significance inside the glycosome."
https://openalex.org/W1579187663,"Abstract Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-5, isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysates, is a monomeric protein of Mr = 58,000-62,000. Immunochemical methods were employed to identify eIF-5 in crude cell lysates. Antisera against purified denatured eIF-5 were prepared in rabbits and characterized by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation techniques using native and denatured eIF-5 as antigens. Monospecific antibodies to denatured eIF-5 were affinity-purified using eIF-5 blotted onto aminophenylthioether paper. Rabbit reticulocytes, HeLa cells and mouse L cells were lysed directly into a denaturing buffer containing 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The denatured proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-eIF-5 antibodies. With each lysate, one major immunoreactive polypeptide was observed whose molecular weight corresponded to that of purified eIF-5 (Mr = 58,000-62,000). No degradation products or precursor forms of molecular weight higher than 62,000 were detected in any lysate. These results indicate that isolated eIF-5 is the same size as that found in crude lysates. Additional characterization of eIF-5 indicates that purified eIF-5 can be phosphorylated at serine residues in vitro by casein kinase II. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylated eIF-5 retains full biological activity in catalyzing the joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to a preformed 40 S ribosomal initiation complex to form an 80 S initiation complex. Based on its specific activity, we demonstrate that 1 pmol of rabbit reticulocyte eIF-5 mediates the formation of approximately 180 pmol of 80 S initiation complex under the conditions of in vitro initiation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1584504713,"Sidedness of the effect of K+ on Ca transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca pump reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles was investigated. The reconstituted vesicles which sustained a high rate of Ca transport even in the absence of Ca-precipitating anions exhibited low passive permeabilities to 42K+, 86Rb+, or 45Ca2+. Evidence was presented that K+ activated the Ca pump on the external surface of the vesicles and that it was not taken up by the vesicles during the pump activity. In the presence of high externally added K+, the reconstituted vesicles preloaded with K+ exhibited a significantly higher Ca transport activity than the vesicles preloaded with Tris+ but not the ones preloaded with Li+. Ca transport by the K+-loaded vesicles was accompanied by a small amount of K+ efflux, which corresponded to about 20% of the amount of Ca+ taken up. Since the intravesicular K+ did not affect the turnover of the ADP-insensitive component (E2P) of the phosphoenzyme intermediate formed during the pump cycle, it was concluded that the intravesicular K+ stimulated the Ca pump activity indirectly by compensating the charge imbalance caused by the electrogenic Ca2+ movement. These results thus indicate that K+ activates the Ca pump only on the cytoplasmic side of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, but it is not obligately transported across the membrane under conditions where K+ fully activates the Ca pump."
https://openalex.org/W2149924295,"A phage T4 DNA packaging enzyme appears to arise as a processed form of the major T4 capsid structural protein gp23. The enzyme activity and antigen are missing from all head gene mutants that block the morphogenetic proteolytic processing reactions of the head proteins in vivo. The enzyme antigen can be formed in vitro by T4 (gp21) specific processing of gp23 containing extracts. Enzyme antigen is found in active processed proheads but not in full heads. The enzyme and the major capsid protein show immunological cross-reactivity, produce common peptides upon proteolysis, and share an assembly-conformation-dependent ATP binding site. The packaging enzyme and the mature capsid protein (gp23*) both appear to arise from processing of gp23, the former as a minor product of a specific gp23 structure in the prohead, acting in DNA packaging as a DNA-dependent ATPase, and a headful-dependent terminase."
https://openalex.org/W2076937044,"The kidney maintains the elevated plasma concentration of bicarbonate that occurs in chronic metabolic alkalosis. A reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can maintain the filtered bicarbonate load at a normal level so that a normal rate of bicarbonate reabsorption suffices to prevent urinary excretion of this anion. It is also possible that bicarbonate reabsorption might increase so as to maintain the alkalosis if GFR were not reduced. To examine this latter possibility, atrial natriuretic factor was used in alkalotic rats to restore a more normal GFR and to increase the amount of bicarbonate filtered by the glomerulus. Proximal bicarbonate reabsorption remained relatively static. Higher than normal amounts of bicarbonate were then delivered out of the proximal tubule, bicarbonate appeared in the urine, and the plasma concentration of bicarbonate fell. A reduction in GFR is thus necessary for the maintenance of chronic metabolic alkalosis. Normalizing GFR induces bicarbonaturia and initiates repair of the alkalosis."
https://openalex.org/W2007853883,"A visual analog to binaural unmasking was explored. The observer's task was to detect, under stereoscopic viewing conditions, an apertured sinusoidal grating added to a square patch of visual noise. In the experimental condition, the square patch of noise was presented within a frame such that the right-eye noise was a shifted version of the left-eye noise. Because of the disparity in the noise images, subjects perceived, under stereoscopic viewing conditions, that the noise patch was located behind the frame. When sinusoidal signals were added to this noise patch, the signals were clearly more detectable when the signal disparity was zero than when the signal disparity equaled that of the noise patch, demonstrating the existence of visual unmasking. Hence, under appropriate circumstances, binocular processing, in addition to providing information about depth, can also enhance the detectability of visual patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1565788605,"Primosome assembly sites are complex DNA structures that share common functions (they elicit the DNA-dependent ATPase of replication factor Y from Escherichia coli and serve as origins of complementary strand DNA synthesis), but display little sequence homology. In order to ascertain a common basis for factor Y-DNA recognition, a primosome assembly site and its mutated derivatives have been functionally and structurally analyzed. Under conditions in which they lose the capacity to function as ATPase effectors these DNA templates have been (i) assayed for their ability to bind factor Y, and (ii) probed, with pancreatic DNase, for structural alterations. In this ATPase-inactivating environment (suboptimal concentrations of MgCl2 and NaCl, and high levels of the E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein), factor Y does not bind to its cognate DNA and the DNase cleavage pattern characteristic of this site is perceptibly changed: compared to the DNase digest obtained under activating conditions, cleavage is notably decreased in the 5' half of the site and enhanced at the 3' end. The results of this study strongly indicate that the structure of the primosome assembly site under analysis consists of two hairpins which interact with each other. When the sites of pancreatic DNase attack are plotted on the proposed double hairpin structure, the 5' cleavage sites all map to one duplex while the 3' sites map to the other. The observation that, under factor Y ATPase-activating conditions, the 3' hairpin is largely refractory to the action of pancreatic DNase indicates that tertiary interactions between the two duplexes render a portion of the DNA structure inaccessible to the nuclease."

https://openalex.org/W1516994087,"A previously undescribed protein has been isolated and purified from the extracellular matrix of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor, a murine tumor that synthesizes an extensive matrix composed of basement membrane molecules. Molecular characterization of the molecule determined that it is a glycoprotein with internal disulfide bonds and an isoelectric point of 6.0. Electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the glycoprotein migrated as a diffuse band with a molecular weight of approximately 72,000-80,000. The amino acid composition was significantly different from known basement membrane components. Polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the glycoprotein localized it to the kidney glomerular basement membrane. These antibodies did not cross-react with either known basement membrane components (laminin, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan), with 70K culture shock protein or with components of normal mouse serum (including mouse transferrin, albumin, or alpha-fetoprotein), when analyzed by Western immunoblots. Our data indicate that the glycoprotein is synthesized by the EHS tumor cells and is present at relatively high levels in the EHS tumor matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1589734367,"Abstract We have undertaken a search for mammalian DNA-binding proteins that enhance the activity of DNA polymerases in a template sequence-specific fashion. In this paper, we report the extensive purification and characterization of a new DNA-binding protein from rabbit liver that selectively stimulates DNA polymerases to copy synthetic poly[d(G-C)] and the poly(dC) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG) as well as single-stranded natural DNA that contains stretches of oligo(dC). The enhancing protein, a polypeptide of 65 kDa designated factor C, stimulates the copying of the two synthetic templates by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, Micrococcus luteus polymerase, and eukaryotic DNA polymerases alpha and beta, but not by avian myeloblastosis virus polymerase. Factor C, however, does not affect utilization by these polymerases of the poly(dG) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG), of poly(dC) primed by oligo(dG), or of poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly[d(A-T)]. With polymerase I, Michaelis constants (Km) of poly[d(G-C)] and of the poly(dC) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG) are decreased by factor C 37- and 4.7-fold, respectively, whereas maximum velocity (Vmax) remains unchanged. By contrast, neither the Km value of the poly(dG) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG) nor the Vmax value with this template is altered by factor C. Rates of copying of activated DNA, denatured DNA, or singly primed M13 DNA are not affected significantly by factor C. However, primer extension analysis of the copying of recombinant M13N4 DNA that contains runs of oligo(dC) within an inserted thymidine kinase gene shows that factor C increases processivity by specifically augmenting the efficiency at which polymerase I traverses the oligo(dC) stretches. Direct binding of factor C to denatured DNA is indicated by retention of the protein-DNA complex on columns of DEAE-cellulose. Binding of factor C to poly[d(G-C)] is demonstrated by the specific adsorption of the enhancing protein to columns of poly[d(G-C)]-Sepharose. We propose that by binding to poly[d(G-C)] and to poly(dC).poly(dG), factor C enables tighter binding of some DNA polymerases to these templates and facilitates enzymatic activity."
