https://openalex.org/W2080435498,"Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a central transcription factor involved in the transcriptional activation of many genes encoding phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes via the antioxidant response element. Nrf2 has previously been found to undergo nuclear translocation by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism mediated by protein kinase C in HepG2 cells treated withtert-butylhydroquinone, β-naphthoflavone, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In the present report, we have found that the levels of Nrf2 were increased in cells treated with tert-butylhydroquinone or β-naphthoflavone by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Treatment of HepG2 cells with cycloheximide resulted in the loss of Nrf2 within 30 min. By contrast, treatment with the proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin or MG-132) caused an accumulation of Nrf2 as well as an induction of reporter gene activity in cells transfected with theGSTA2 antioxidant response element-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase construct. Similarly, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid also caused an accumulation of Nrf2, whereas the reverse effects were observed with PD 98059 and U 0126, two compounds that block the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. These data suggest that Nrf2 is degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway and that phosphorylation of Nrf2 leads to an increase in its stability and subsequent transactivation activity.

Transcriptional activation through the ARE is largely dependent upon the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (11Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression of GstA1 andNqo1 has been shown to be markedly reduced inNrf2 (−/−) mice as compared with wild-type animals (16Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Both the basal and/or the inducible expression of these enzymes and the γ-GCS subunits by known ARE inducers were also found to be impaired in these null mice (16Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, the decreased expression of many antioxidant and Phase II enzymes inNrf2 (−/−) mice has been linked to the increased sensitivity of these animals to the toxic effects of acetaminophen and carcinogens (18Chan K. Han X.D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 19Enomoto A. Itoh K. Nagayoshi E. Haruta J. Kimura T. O'Connor T. Harada T.

A number of recent studies have focused on identifying the signaling pathways that may be involved in transducing the ARE-mediated response. These include the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (21Yu R. Lei W. Mandlejar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that activation of Nrf2 in HepG2 cells treated with tBHQ, β-NF, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate involves in part a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism mediated by PKC, which appears to promote translocation of the transcription factor into the nucleus (27Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These findings support the notion that Nrf2 may be activated by a process that involves a disruption of its interaction with the cytoskeleton-associated protein Keap1 that retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm (28Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently obtained evidence showing that phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser-40 by PKC interferes with the association between the two proteins (29Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have further explored the mechanisms involved in the activation of this transcription factor. Nrf2 was found to undergo rapid degradation mediated by the 26 S proteasome but became stabilized in cells exposed to tBHQ and β-NF, leading to its accumulation and enhanced transcriptional activity. The stabilization of Nrf2 appears to depend upon its phosphorylation by a protein kinase(s) associated with the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. Thus regulation of Nrf2 stability may represent an important mechanism in the activation of ARE-dependent gene expression in response to oxidative stress. Cycloheximide (CHX), tBHQ, and β-NF were obtained from Sigma. Lactacystin (LC), MG-132, okadaic acid (OA), staurosporine (stauro), PD 98059, and U 0126 were obtained fromCalbiochem. Antibodies against ubiquitin, and a C-terminal peptide of Nrf2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-GAPDH antibodies were obtained from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ). In addition, antibodies against a peptide derived from the N-terminal region of Nrf2 were raised in rabbits byBIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA) for the present study. This antibody specifically recognizes both human and rat Nrf2. HepG2 and H4IIEC3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin, all of which were obtained from Invitrogen. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 40–50% confluency and incubated for 20 h prior to treatment with chemicals or for use in transfection experiments. For time-course experiments, cells were treated with chemicals following a schedule such that they would all be harvested simultaneously. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfection procedures, plasmid DNA, CAT activity assays, and quantitation methods have been described previously (15Nguyen T. Huang H.-C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). HepG2 or H4IIEC3 cells were cultured and treated with chemicals as described above. In the CHX experiments, cells were treated with CHX (5 μg/ml) or pretreated with tBHQ (50 μm) for 2 h before addition of CHX in the time-course assays. In experiments where cells were exposed to OA (20 nm) and tBHQ, both reagents were added simultaneously. Following the treatment period, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and lyzed directly with SDS sample buffer. Total cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% or 4–12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with specific antibodies. Immunoreactive polypeptides were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent purchased from Amersham Biosciences and subsequent autoradiography. Quantitation of the results was performed by exposing the immunoblots directly to a Fuji phosphorimaging device or by analyzing the autoradiogram with a densitometer. For immunoprecipitation, cells were treated with tBHQ (50 μm), LC (5 μm), and MG-132 (10 μm) for 4 h, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and lyzed in immunoprecipitation buffer as described previously (27Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with anti-Nrf2 antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h, and the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The precipitates were then washed extensively with immunoprecipitation buffer before fractionation by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The relative levels of mRNA encoding Nrf2 and γ-GCSh in HepG2 cells were compared by TaqMan® real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and then treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega). The cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using Superscript-RT (Invitrogen) and subsequently analyzed by TaqMan® using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were designed for human Nrf2 andγ-GCSh using the Primer Express Software and were obtained from Applied Biosystems. For analysis of human Nrf2, the forward 5′-TACTCCCAGGTTGCCCACA-3′ and reverse 5′-CATCTACAAACGGGAATGTCTGC-3′ primers were used along with the TaqMan® probe 5′-[FAM]-TCAGATGCTTTGTACTTTGATGACTGCATGC-[TAMARA]-3′. For human γ-GCSh, the forward 5′-TTGCAGGAAGGCATTGATCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GCATCATCCAGGTGTATTTTCTCTT-3′ primers were used along with the TaqMan® probe 5′-[FAM]-TGGCCCAGCATGTTGCTCATCTCTTTAT-[TAMARA]-3′. In both cases, the forward primer was designed over the first intron/exon boundary of the respective gene and, along with the reverse primer, gave rise to a 91-bp (Nrf2) or 101-bp (γ-GCSh) amplicon. A primer/probe set for human GAPDH was also obtained from Applied Biosystems. TaqMan® reactions included 200 nm of each primer with 100 nm of each probe and 1× final concentration of TaqMan® Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were carried out with duplicate pipefitting. TaqMan® software was used to calculate a Ct value. The fold increase or decrease in individual mRNAs was calculated as follows:Ct Nrf2 orCt γ−GCSh −Ct GAPDH = ΔCt; then the 240−ΔCt value for treated samples was divided by the same calculated value for control samples. Nrf2 has been demonstrated to regulate both the basal and inducible expression of many ARE-responsive genes (17McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that Nrf2 is constitutively expressed and that its transactivation activity increases in response to an inducing signal. We sought to determine whether the level of the Nrf2 protein is affected during induction. HepG2 cells were treated with either tBHQ or β-NF in a time-course experiment, and the level of Nrf2 protein in cell lysates was determined by immunoblot analysis. The blots were first probed with anti-Nrf2 antibodies and followed with anti-GAPDH antibodies. The level of GAPDH was used to normalize for sample loading. As shown in Fig. 1, A and C, the amount of Nrf2 was found to increase within 15 min of treatment with tBHQ, and this continued up to the 8-h time point, where an 8.5-fold increase was observed. By 24 h post-treatment, the level of Nrf2 protein decreased to ∼5-fold over the basal level. A similar increase of Nrf2 was also observed in the tBHQ-treated rat hepatoma H4IIEC3 cells (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether such effects could be produced by a different ARE inducer, we analyzed lysates from HepG2 cells treated with β-NF. In this case, the Nrf2 protein level was also found to increase during the time-course experiment, becoming apparent at the 4-h time point with a 3-fold increase over the basal level. The maximal level was attained at 8 h post-treatment (5-fold) and remained at this plateau up to the 24-h time point (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether the increased Nrf2 expression induced by tBHQ in HepG2 cells was the result of an increase in Nrf2 transcription or by a post-transcriptional mechanism, we measured Nrf2mRNA levels in these cells. Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells following exposure to tBHQ for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h. The RNA was subject to analysis by a quantitative PCR-based approach using oligonucleotide primers specific for Nrf2. As a control, the GAPDH mRNA levels were similarly quantified and used to normalize the data. Fig. 2shows the results of these experiments. The levels ofNrf2 mRNA were found to be unaffected by tBHQ. To ensure that the tBHQ treatment was effective, we also measured the levels of mRNA for the γ-GCSh subunit gene. The transcriptional regulation of this gene by tBHQ has been shown to be Nrf2-dependent (13Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 17McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the level of γ-GCSh mRNA was found to increase gradually starting at 2 h of post-treatment and was highest at the 6-h time point with an ∼4-fold increase. Thus tBHQ was effective in eliciting an ARE response in these cells. Together these data indicate that the elevated level of Nrf2 in tBHQ-treated HepG2 cells was not due to an increase in Nrf2transcription. The elevated Nrf2 level in the absence of an increased rate of transcription implies that the turnover rate for Nrf2 may decrease in response to tBHQ, therefore increasing its stability. To examine this possibility, HepG2 cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX in a time-course experiment (for 0 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, and 2 h) and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. The results of this experiment show that the Nrf2 protein level decreased to ∼50% within 15 min of treatment with CHX. A trace amount of Nrf2 was detected after 30 min of exposure to CHX (Fig. 3, A and C). To determine the effects of tBHQ on Nrf2 stability, HepG2 cells were pretreated with tBHQ for 2 h before exposure to CHX in a similar time-course experiment as described above. The results depicted in Fig. 3, B and C show that the level of Nrf2 decreased to ∼50% after 30 min of CHX exposure and 5% at the 1-h time point. The decreased turnover rate in tBHQ-treated HepG2 cells implies that Nrf2 may become more resistant to degradation. Proteins with regulatory functions, such as the cyclins and transcription activators (30King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 31Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), are commonly degraded by the proteasome through the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Therefore we sought to determine if Nrf2 might be proteolytically degraded by this pathway. In a time-course experiment, HepG2 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor LC for 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h. The cells were lyzed, and total cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Nrf2 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The results of these experiments show that intracellular Nrf2 protein started to accumulate within 1.5 h of incubation with LC (a 2-fold increase), and this continued with a 5.5-fold increase by 8 h. By 24 h, the Nrf2 protein decreased to a lower level than that of untreated cells (basal level), presumably because LC was no longer effective in the cells or became toxic (Fig. 4 A). To support these data a parallel experiment using a structurally different proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, was performed. As with LC, MG-132 caused a similar pattern of Nrf2 accumulation in the cells (data not shown; Fig. 5 A, lane 5). To further confirm the involvement of the 26 S proteasome, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to detect ubiquitinated forms of Nrf2. Following treatment with LC or MG-132 in the presence or absence of tBHQ, HepG2 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Nrf2 antibodies and then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, protein bands with slower mobility than Nrf2 were detected only in the lysates of cells treated with either LC or MG-132 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and 5). Treatment with tBHQ did not have any apparent effect on the accumulation of these slow-migrating protein bands (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2,4, and 6). Similar observations have been made in recent studies on the ubiquitination of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (32Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and the β2-adrenergic receptor and β-arrestin protein (33Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar).Figure 5Phosphorylation by MAPK/ERK pathway increases Nrf2 stability. A, HepG2 cells were exposed to solvent (Me2SO, lane 2), 50 μmtBHQ (lane 3), LC (lane 4), 10 μmMG-132 (lane 5), 20 nm OA (lane 6), OA and tBHQ (lane 7), 10 nm staurosporine (Stauro, lane 8), Stauro and tBHQ (lane 9) for 4 h, and total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Nrf2 antibodies.

TNT-Nrf2, in vitro translated Nrf2 as positive control. The asterisk (*) indicates a nonspecific, cross-reacting band. The results inA and B were quantitated using a densitometer, and the Nrf2 values were plotted after normalization with those of GAPDH. The blots shown are representatives of three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Transient transfection experiments were also performed to determine if the proteasome inhibitors can mimic ARE inducers such as tBHQ to elicit a transcriptional response through the ARE. As shown in Fig. 6, LC or MG-132 treatment of HepG2 cells transfected with the GSTA2 ARE-CAT reporter construct induced CAT activity ∼3.5-fold over the basal level. Further treatment with tBHQ did not lead to higher CAT activity. Phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC caused by ARE inducers appears to promote its nuclear translocation (27Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To determine if phosphorylation of Nrf2 also contributes to its stability, we employed OA, a protein phosphatase inhibitor that induces intracellular hyperphosphorylation (34Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Treatment of HepG2 cells with OA resulted in an increase in the Nrf2 protein by ∼2-fold as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 A) as well as a 2.5-fold induction of CAT activity from the GSTA2 ARE-CAT construct (Fig. 6). The level of Nrf2 (9.5-fold) as well as the CAT activity (4.5-fold) was increased further in cells co-treated with OA and tBHQ (Fig. 5 A, and Fig. 6) as compared with those treated with tBHQ alone (6.2-fold and 3-fold, respectively). In contrast, treatment with the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor staurosporine did not affect the level of Nrf2 (Fig. 5 A), although this inhibitor did attenuate the induction of CAT activity by tBHQ (Fig. 6). These data indicate that phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC may not be essential for its stability. However, cellular hyperphosphorylation induced by OA appears to have a positive effect on Nrf2 stability and transactivation activity. It has been previously reported that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of the ARE response (21Yu R. Lei W. Mandlejar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We sought to determine if phosphorylation events mediated by this pathway may have a role in promoting Nrf2 stability. In this experiment, HepG2 cells were pretreated with PD 98059 or U 0126 for 1 h followed by tBHQ treatment for 4 h. The lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with both anti-Nrf2 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The results of this experiment show that both of these compounds attenuated the inducing effects of tBHQ on the Nrf2 protein level, with PD 98059 and U 0126 causing a reduction of ∼60 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest a link between phosphorylation and Nrf2 stability and a positive effect from the MAPK/ERK pathway. The expression of many antioxidant and Phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes is increased in cells during oxidative stress (35Hayes J.D. McMahon M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and the induction process is primarily mediated by the transcription factor Nrf2 acting on the ARE present in the promoter of genes encoding these enzymes. The established mechanism of activation of the ARE-mediated pathway has been demonstrated to lead to the dissociation of Nrf2 from the cytoskeleton-anchored Keap1 protein, which results in its translocation into the nucleus to increase gene transcription (28Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar, 36Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have examined the association between these two proteins at the molecular levels, including potential sites involved in the interaction (28Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar), the necessity for dimerization of Keap1 to associate with Nrf2 (37Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36544-36552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and critical cysteine residues of Keap1 that become modified by electrophilic agents to induce the release of Nrf2 (38Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Separately, phosphorylation of a serine residue in Nrf2 by PKC has been shown to interfere with its binding to Keap1 (29Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined other mechanisms involving Nrf2 that are important for ARE-driven transcription. We observed that the level of cellular Nrf2 increased in HepG2 cells treated with either tBHQ or β-NF, two structurally diverse compounds that activate gene expression via the ARE (1Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of cellular Nrf2 by β-NF occurred at a later time point as compared with tBHQ. This delay is consistent with the observation that β-NF must first be metabolized to a reactive intermediate by CYP1A1 to become an active inducer of the ARE response (2Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the increase in the level of Nrf2 in response to tBHQ is mediated by a post-transcriptional mechanism, rather than an increase in Nrf2 mRNA levels. These findings are consistent with other studies that have demonstrated that Nrf2 mRNA levels are unaffected by various inducers of ARE activity (13Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 39Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). A more recent study, however, reported that the expression of Nrf2 was increased in murine keratinocytes by 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), but this effect was attributed to an increase in the rate ofNrf2 transcription (40Kwak M.-K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These results are contradictory to those observed in this and other studies and are possibly due to differences in the experimental procedures, cell types, and compounds being used. Our data also suggest that increased Nrf2 stability, rather than an increase in the rate of protein translation, is responsible for the higher level of Nrf2 observed in tBHQ- or β-NF-treated cells. We have also obtained evidence demonstrating that the 26 S proteasome plays an important role in the regulation of the Nrf2 protein. Thus it appears that the steady-state level of Nrf2 is maintained by a precise balance between the rates of its synthesis and its degradation by the proteasome. We hypothesize that in response to oxidative stress Nrf2 would continue to be synthesized at a normal rate, but the rate of its degradation decreases such that the balance would now tip toward accumulation of the protein, ultimately leading to an enhanced transcriptional activity. These data raise an important question as to the mechanism(s) that regulate Nrf2 stability in the cell. Since degradation by the 26 S proteasome requires prior ubiquitination of the substrate molecule, recognition and targeting of the Nrf2 protein by the ubiquitin ligases may represent the critical, rate-limiting step. As phosphorylation of Nrf2 was found to be promoted in cells treated with ARE inducers (27Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), it is possible that phosphorylation may also contribute to its stabilization, perhaps by rendering the protein inaccessible to the ubiquitin ligases. This type of mechanism is exemplified by the p53 transcription factor whose phosphorylation has been shown to reduce its affinity for the Mdm2 protein and therefore increase its stability (41Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 42Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H.

Indeed, our findings that both an accumulation of Nrf2 as well as an increase in ARE-dependent reporter gene activity were induced by OA in HepG2 cells support the hypothesis that phosphorylation does have an important role in the stability and transcriptional activity of Nrf2. Furthermore, using inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK pathway, it appears that this pathway may lead to phosphorylation of Nrf2 and its increased stability. These findings confirm previous reports implicating the MAPK/ERK pathway in the regulation of ARE-responsive genes (21Yu R. Lei W. Mandlejar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 22Yu R. Chen C. Mo Y.-Y. Hebbar V. Owuor E.D. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although PKC can phosphorylate Nrf2, these kinases did not seem to affect its stability. The treatment of cells with staurosporine does attenuate the induction of ARE-dependent reporter gene activity by tBHQ but had no effects on the Nrf2 protein level. Together, our data indicate that regulation of the Nrf2 activity may involve phosphorylation at multiple sites, each of which is associated with a particular function. Finally, it remains to be seen what role, if any, the PI3K/Akt pathway, which has also been implicated in regulation of ARE-responsive genes (24Kang K.W. Ryu J.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Kang K.W. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), may have on processes controlling the activation of Nrf2 activity. Inhibition of the PI3-kinase enzyme interfered with the inducing effects of tBHQ on a number of genes in IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells, one of which encodes Keap1 (44Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The significance of the induction of Keap1 by tBHQ is not known but was suggested to possibly constitute a feedback mechanism to repress the activation of ARE-dependent genes and return their expression to basal level (44Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus the induction of ARE-dependent enzymes appears to be regulated by a coordinated process that controls the activation of Nrf2 activity at multiple levels, including its nuclear translocation, protein stability, and possibly feedback repression. Recent studies have begun to elucidate mechanisms governing its interaction with Keap1 and thus its movement across the nuclear envelop (29Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 37Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Elucidation of mechanisms that mediate the increased stability of Nrf2 will require the identification of the specific protein kinase(s) involved as well as the site(s) of phosphorylation. Equally important is the identification of other components, such as those that mediate the interaction of Nrf2 with the proteasome proteolytic pathway. Together, such mechanistic data will provide insights into the various regulatory mechanisms involved in the induction of antioxidant and drug-metabolizing enzymes important for the protection of cells against oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species."

The HIF hydroxylases therefore provide a focus for understanding cellular responses to hypoxia and a target for therapeutic manipulation. Here we report crystal structures for the HIF asparagine hydroxylase (FIH) alone and complexed with CAD polypeptides, cosubstrates, and inhibitors. FIH, CAD775–826, and CAD786–826 were prepared as described (10Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.-M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M.

Selenomethionine (SeMet) substituted FIH was produced using a metabolic inhibition protocol and LeMaster media supplemented with 50 mg/literl-selenomethionine. SeMet incorporation was >95% by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Aerobic crystallization of SeMet FIH (at 11 mg/ml) was accomplished by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 17 °C. The mother liquor consisted of 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 4% PEG 400 and 0.1m Hepes pH 7.5. Crystallization of FIH-Fe-CAD fragment complexes was accomplished under an anaerobic atmosphere of argon in a Belle Technology glove box (0.3–0.4 ppm O2) using the same mother liquor and a solution containing FIH (at 11 mg/ml), Fe2+ (1 mm), 2OG/NOG (2 mm), and CAD fragment (1 mm). Crystallization of FIH-Zn-CAD fragment was accomplished aerobically under similar conditions. Peptides were either synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis or purchased from Biopeptide Co. (San Diego, CA). Crystals were cryocooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen and x-ray data were collected at 100 K using a nitrogen stream. Cryoprotection was accomplished by sequential transfer into a solution containing 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 3% PEG 400, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10% followed by 24% glycerol. A three-wavelength multiple anomalous dispersion data set was collected to 2.9-Å resolution on beamline 14.2 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK. Data from crystals of FIH-CAD complexes were collected on beamlines 14.2, 9.6, or 9.5 using ADSC Quantum 4 (14.2 and 9.6) or MarCCD detectors (9.5). All data were processed with MOSFLM and the CCP4 suite (15Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19825) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to space groupP41212. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains one FIH molecule. Six selenium positions were located and phases calculated using SOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Density modification, which increased the figure of merit from 0.56 to 0.66, was performed using RESOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). An initial model was built using O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar) and refined against the SeMet data (remote wavelength) using CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Following further rebuilding and refinement, which brought theR free to 32.3%, the model was transferred to the 2.15-Å data set. Rebuilding and refinement using REFMAC5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), including addition of iron, substrate and solvent molecules, and refinement of TLS parameters brought the conventionalR-factor to 17.8% and the R free to 21.3%. The following residues are missing in the current model: 1–15 and 304–306 of FIH and 786–794, 807–811, and 824–826 of the CAD fragment. According to PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) there are no Ramachandran disallowed residues, and 90.7% of residues have most favorable backbone conformations. For the CAD peptide, 77.8% of residues are in the most favorable region with the remaining 22.2% in additionally allowed regions. Other structures were solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates from the 2.15-Å data and refinement using REFMAC5. In all structures electron density for the iron and 2OG/NOG was visible throughout refinement. Significant positive difference electron density was observed between the iron and the CAD Asn803β-carbon. Since B-factor differences between FIH and CAD imply that the CAD is not at 100% occupancy, this may represent an alternative binding mode for the 20G 1-carboxylate in the absence of substrate, although it could also be due to a ligating water molecule, again in the absence of substrate. Figures were prepared with Molscript (22Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Bobscript (23Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3879) Google Scholar), and Pymol (www.pymol.org). To obtain an FIH-CAD complex without oxidation of the CAD or the Fe(II), anaerobic conditions were employed to crystallize FIH in the presence of Fe(II), 2OG, and various CAD polypeptides from 7–52 residues. Crystals were also obtained anaerobically for FIH complexed with Fe(II) and the FIH inhibitor NOG and aerobically for FIH complexed with Zn(II)and NOG. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using a model obtained by multiple anomalous dispersion on selenomethionine-substituted apo-FIH. Crystalline FIH-CAD complexes were obtained with CAD786–826 and CAD775–826. Crystallization attempts with CAD787–806, HIF-2α CAD850–862(equivalent to HIF-1α CAD802–814), and CAD800–806 did not result in FIH-CAD complexes. Thus, a CAD peptide of greater than 20 residues was required (see below). Structures 1–3 (Table I) are of the FIH-CAD complexes, while structure 4 is of FIH in the absence of CAD.

Analysis of crystallographic symmetry revealed a dimeric form of FIH, consistent with native gel-electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). The dimer interface involves the two C-terminal helices of each molecule in an interlocking arrangement predominantly involving hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1,a and b). This unusual interface buries a surface area of 3210 Å2, which is large by comparison with other dimeric proteins of this size (25Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The core of FIH comprises a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH or jellyroll) motif formed from eight β-strands, β8–β11 and β14–β17 (Fig. 1 a) that is characteristic of the 2OG oxygenase superfamily. Residues 220–259 form an insert between strands 4 (β11) and 5 (β14) of the DSBH. One face of the DSBH is flanked by an additional four β-strands from the N-terminal region to form an eight-membered antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1 a). Interestingly, the N-terminal strand β1 bisects the face of the DSBH opposite to the active site (Fig. 1 a). The β1 strand has a 360° twist located at a PXXP sequence, in between its interactions with β14 and β2. A similarly positioned β-strand is found in most 2OG dependent oxygenases, although not always from the same region of the protein. The sheet-helix-sheet motif formed by β1, α1, and β2 is conserved in all enzymes of this class except proline 3-hydroxylase. The DSBH topology of FIH defines it as a member of a superfamily of DSBH proteins, including non iron-containing enzymes such as the Cu(II) utilizing quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (26Fusetti F. Schröter K.H. Steiner R.A. van Noort P.I. Pijning T. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Egmond M.R. Dijkstra B.W.

The structures unexpectedly reveal the existence of two distinct FIH-CAD interaction sites, one involving the hydroxylation site itself (CAD795–806, site 1) and a second lying to the C-terminal side of this site (CAD813–822, site 2) (Fig. 2, a and b). The binding sites involve contact surface areas of 1640 Å2 and 1080 Å2, respectively, and CAD residues in these regions are highly conserved in all known HIF-1α and HIF-2α sequences. Kinetic analyses were employed to investigate the relative importance of sites 1 and 2. CAD fragments shorter than 20 residues are not efficient in vitro substrates (TableII). Those containing site 1 only are hydroxylated by FIH 2L. A. McNeill, unpublished results.but less efficiently than those containing both sites, consistent with the crystallographic data. Electron density for site 1 is of good quality, with only the side chain of Tyr798 poorly defined, while that for site 2 is at a lower level and quality, probably reflecting weaker binding at this site (Fig. 2 c). CAD804–806, and presumably also CAD807–811for which density was not observed, do not form direct interactions with FIH.Table IIFIH activity with various HIF fragment peptidesPeptide sequenceLength (residues)Equivalent residuesActivity relative to HIF-1α 775–826%HIF-1α 52-mer52HIF-1α 775–826100HIF-1α 41-mer41HIF-1α 786–826100MDESGLPQLTSYDCEVNAPI20HIF-1α 787–806∼30VNVPVLGSSTLLQ13HIF-2α 850–8620.10CEVNAPI7HIF-1α 800–8060.05DCEVNVPVLG10HIF-2α 847–856<0.05TSYDCEVNAPIQSRNL13HIF-1α 796–811<0.05DESGLPQLTSYDCEVNAPI19HIF-1α 788–80640Activity was measured by decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate.

At site 1, HIF-CAD795–803 residues are bound in a groove (Fig. 2 b) and adopt a largely extended conformation linked to FIH by ten hydrogen bonds. Asn803 of CAD is completely buried at the active site and lies directly adjacent to the Fe(II). CAD Asn803 and Ala804 form a tight turn, stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of Val802 and NH of Ala804, which projects the side chain of Asn803 toward the Fe(II). This side chain is precisely orientated by three hydrogen bonds to enable hydroxylation at the pro-S position of the β-carbon (Fig. 1 d), consistent with NMR assignment of hydroxylation at this site.2 The primary amide of CAD Asn803 is sandwiched between FIH residue Tyr102 and the Fe(II). It forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of FIH residues Gln239 and Arg238 (Fig. 1 d), residues located on the insert to the DSBH motif, rationalizing the unusual selectivity of FIH for asparagine over aspartate (10Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.-M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26351-26355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the substrate and Fe(II)binding sites are directly linked, since the backbone nitrogen of CAD Asn803 also forms a hydrogen bond (∼3 Å) with the carboxylate oxygen of Asp201 that is not complexed to the iron. Six additional hydrogen bonds stabilize the binding of FIH to CAD795–801. In contrast with site 1, site 2 is bound on the FIH surface and involves only two hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2 a). CAD816–823 of site 2 form an α-helix, in exact agreement with the structure of this region in complex with CBP/p300 (12Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 13Freedman S.J. Sun Z.-Y.J. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As in that complex, the highly conserved Leu818, Leu819, and Leu822 sit in a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of FIH (Fig. 2 a); it is not possible for CAD to bind simultaneously to CBP/p300 and FIH. The extended loop conformation adopted by the CAD residues at site 1 contrasts with the α-helical conformation adopted by the same residues when complexed with the 1st transcriptional adaptor zinc-binding domain (TAZ1) of CBP/p300 (12Dames S.A.

The disordered structure observed for the CAD, and other HIF-α residues (7Hon W.-C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D.W. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), when free in solution may thus reflect a requirement to adopt more than one conformation for complex formation with different proteins. The changes in the conformation of CAD on binding are complemented by changes in FIH revealing an induced fit binding process. Most strikingly Trp296 of FIH undergoes a 50° rotation about Cβ-Cγ to accommodate CAD Val802, while both Tyr102 and Tyr103 become more ordered. This ordering of FIH on substrate binding may be reflected in the significant improvement in resolution for the structures obtained with CAD fragments bound over those without. Analysis of the active site reveals that the Fe(II) is bound in an almost octahedral manner by the side chains of His199, Asp201, and His279, and the 2-oxo and 1-carboxylate groups of 2OG (Fig. 1 c). While bidentate chelation of 2OG with Fe(II) in this structure was anticipated, the binding interactions for the 2OG 5-carboxylate, which forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Lys214, Thr196, and Tyr145, are unprecedented. In many 2OG oxygenases Arg and Ser/Thr residues fulfil an analogous role. FIH is further unusual in that Lys214 is on the fourth DSBH β-strand, whereas previously assigned basic 2OG-5-carboxylate binding residues are at the beginning of the eighth DSBH strand. In the FIH-CAD complexes (structures 1–3 in Table I), there is a vacant position opposite His279 (Fig. 1, c andd) revealing that the enzyme is primed for dioxygen binding (27Zhou J. Kelly W.L. Bachmann B.O. Gunsior M. Townsend C.A. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7388-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), although there could be rearrangement of the ligands during the catalytic cycle (28Zhang Z.H. Ren J.S. Harlos K. McKinnon C.H. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As with other 2OG oxygenases it is assumed that following binding of dioxygen, decarboxylation of 2OG yields an iron-oxo species [Fe(IV) = O ↔ Fe(III)-O⋅] that effects oxidation at the β-carbon of CAD Asn803 (Fig. 3 a). Interestingly, accommodation of a dioxygen ligand (or an alternate 2OG conformation) opposite His279 may require disruption of the unusual hydrogen bond between Asp201 and CAD Asn803(the Fe(II) and Asn803 β-carbon are only ∼4.9 Å apart) that is observed in the anaerobic enzyme substrate complex (Fig. 1 d). This hydrogen bond may have energetic consequences for the binding of dioxygen that are relevant to the oxygen sensing function of the enzyme. To understand the mechanisms of action of hydroxylase inhibitors, structures were also obtained for FIH complexed with NOG and with Zn(II). FIH was demonstrated to bind Zn(II) in an identical manner to Fe(II) (structure 3), consistent with the metal-mediated mimic of hypoxia being due to displacement of Fe(II) from the active site of HIF hydroxylases. FIH-CAD structures with NOG reveal that like 2OG it is ligated to Fe(II) in a bidentate manner (Fig. 1 c) and imply that it is an inhibitor due to decreased susceptibility to attack by an iron bound (su)peroxide. Kinetic analyses of a series of inhibitors based upon N-oxaloyl amino acids demonstrated that theR-enantiomer (IC50 <0.4 mm) ofN-oxaloylalanine was significantly more potent than theS-enantiomer (IC50 2.5 mm). Analysis of the 2OG binding pocket in FIH suggests that the binding of theS-enantiomer is disfavored by interactions with Thr196 and Ile281 in the 2OG binding pocket. Since a reversed selectivity (i.e. theS-enantiomer was more potent) was observed both for procollagen prolyl hydroxylase and the PHD isozymes) (5Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.-M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. von Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar), it should be possible to develop selective inhibitors for individual types of HIF hydroxylase based on such structural constraints. The unusual and precise structural determinants of both CAD and 2OG binding to FIH may aid inhibitor design via linkage of the 2OG and CAD binding sites and development of heterocyclic compounds that mimic the tight turn adopted by the CAD802–804 when complexed to FIH. Recognition of post-translational hydroxylation as a major mode of regulation of the HIF pathway raises an important question as to its general role in biological signaling. Sequence analyses based on the FIH structure indicate that the 2OG oxygenase superfamily extends further than has previously been foreseen (Fig. 3 b). Of particular interest are similarities with the JmjC homology region of the jumonji transcription factors (10Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.-M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M.

Sci. 2001; 26: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These proteins are predicted to have a DSBH core and have been implicated in diverse biological processes such as cell growth and heart development. Conserved HX(D/E) residues had been identified in some JmjC domains but not assigned as an iron binding motif (29Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the light of the FIH structure it is clear that many JmjC proteins have conserved residues including both this motif and the newly defined 2OG 5-carboxylate binding site involving FIH residues Lys214and Thr196 on the fourth strand of the DSBH (Fig. 3 b). The structure therefore implies that FIH is a one of a large family of iron- and 2OG-dependent oxygenases that are involved in the regulation of gene expression.

The RAMP family comprises three accessory proteins (designated RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3) that were originally identified during attempts to clone the receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Phenotypic receptor behavior corresponding to that of the native CGRP receptor could be demonstrated only in recombinant expression systems when another seven-transmembrane receptor, the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CL receptor) was co-expressed with RAMP1 (1McLatchie L.M.

Additional studies extended these observations to identify a general role of RAMPs in modifying the expression and the pharmacology of receptors related to the calcitonin family of peptides (1McLatchie L.M.

To date, studies of RAMP-GPCR interactions have focused predominantly on the receptors for calcitonin and its related peptides (i.e. CGRP, adrenomedullin, and amylin). However, these receptors belong to the Class II family of GPCRs, members of which share a number of structural features and are all activated by peptide ligands (6Sexton P.M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 1999; 2: 440-448Google Scholar). Given these similarities, it is possible that other Class II GPCRs may also interact with RAMP proteins to yield novel receptor phenotypes or receptors with altered pharmacological profiles. Importantly, RAMPs display a ubiquitous tissue distribution (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M.

Cells were then loaded with [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml) overnight at 37 °C, and agonist- or forskolin (100 μm)-mediated cAMP accumulation was determined using ion-exchange chromatography as described previously (17Christopoulos A. Grant M.K. Ayoubzadeh N. Kim O.N. Sauerberg P. Jeppesen L. El-Fakahany E.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1260-1268Google Scholar). PI hydrolysis, cAMP accumulation, and saturation binding assays were always performed in parallel for each transfection. Saturation and competition binding data were analyzed via nonlinear regression using PRISM 4 beta (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). In all instances, data shown are the mean ± S.E. Comparisons between means were performed by one-way analysis of variance. Unless otherwise stated, values ofp < 0.05 were taken as significant. Because the influence of RAMPs on the pharmacology of receptors was unpredictable, we utilized the capacity of receptors to modulate the subcellular distribution of RAMPs as a marker of receptor-RAMP interaction. The distribution of HA or c-Myc N-terminally epitope-tagged RAMPs was monitored by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy in the absence or presence of co-transfection with the following Class II GPCRs: PTH1 and PTH2 receptors, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-2 receptors, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor, and VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. The CTR and CL receptors were used as positive controls. Each RAMP displayed different degrees of cell surface expression when transfected alone in HEK-293 cells. In contrast to the c-Myc RAMP1, high levels of cell surface expression were observed when c-Myc RAMP 2 or 3 were transfected alone into cells. A similar pattern of behavior has been observed for FLAG-tagged murine RAMPs 2 and 3 in oocytes, where receptor-independent cell surface expression requires glycosylation of the RAMPs (18Flahaut M. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14731-14737Google Scholar). Nonetheless, as our c-Myc constructs contained an artificial signal peptide sequence (12Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Google Scholar), we also performed experiments with RAMPs 2 and 3 that incorporated HA tags after the natural, predicted signal peptide sequence of the RAMPs. Using these constructs, a much lower level of cell surface RAMP2 or -3 expression was seen, and indeed the total level of RAMP expressed was also lower than that seen with the c-Myc-tagged RAMPs, particularly for RAMP2. Given the divergence in subcellular distribution with the different tags, we also looked at the localization of RAMP3 incorporating a V5 tag at the C terminus. Like the HA-tagged RAMP3, this construct was principally retained inside the cell in the absence of co-transfection of an interacting receptor, suggesting that either the c-Myc tag or the artificial signal sequence of the c-Myc-tagged construct contributed to the high levels of receptor-independent cell surface expression of RAMPs 2 and 3. It has been suggested that the presence of either the c-Myc or HA tags can differentially affect protein transit and terminal glycosylation in the Golgi (19Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Google Scholar), which would be consistent with our findings. We have principally used the HA-tagged RAMPs 2 and 3 in our primary assay for RAMP-receptor interaction. Co-transfection of the GHRH (Fig. 1, D–F), VPAC2, GLP-1, or GLP-2 (not shown) receptors with each of the RAMPs failed to alter the level of cell surface-expressed RAMP1, -2, or -3. In contrast, co-transfection of the CL receptor (Fig. 1, G–I), CTR (not shown), or VPAC1 receptor (Fig. 1, J–L) led to a significant translocation of each of the RAMPs to the cell surface. Furthermore, co-expression of the PTH2 receptor with RAMP3 (Fig. 1 O), but not the other RAMPs (not shown), led to increased cell surface expression of RAMP3, whereas expression of the PTH1 (Fig. 1 N) or glucagon (Fig. 1 M) receptors with RAMP2, but not other RAMPs (not shown), led to translocation of RAMP2 to the cell surface as well as an increase in total RAMP2 levels. This latter property is likely to be a result of stabilization of the RAMP2 protein when complexed with its receptor partner and is also seen with the classic RAMP partners CTR and CL receptor (not shown). The specificity of RAMP-receptor interactions was also maintained when the c-Myc-tagged RAMPs were used, although the capacity to observe modulation of RAMP distribution required titration of the level of RAMP co-transfected, because of the high level of receptor-independent cell surface expression (not shown). Our findings with the VPAC1, glucagon, PTH1, and PTH2 receptors are the first to demonstrate an interaction between these receptors and RAMPs. Previous study of “unglycosylated” murine RAMPs and PTH1 and glucagon receptors in oocytes have failed to reveal the association between these receptors and RAMP2 (18Flahaut M. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14731-14737Google Scholar). Although this discrepancy in results may represent a species difference in RAMP-receptor interaction or an effect of removal of the consensus glycosylation sites, we believe it is more likely a consequence of the highly divergent cellular backgrounds. We have shown previously that interaction of the CTR with RAMPs, particularly RAMP2, is sensitive to the cellular background in which it is expressed, indicating that other cellular components, such as G proteins, are likely to contribute to RAMP-receptor interactions (5Tilakaratne N. Christopoulos G. Zumpe E.T. Foord S.M. Sexton P.M. J..Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 61-72Google Scholar). The specific pairing of the PTH1, PTH2, and glucagon receptors with only one of the RAMPs highlights the specificity of RAMP-receptor interactions and the diversity of the impact that RAMPs may have on receptor function. The most striking pharmacological consequence of RAMP association with receptors for the calcitonin family of peptides is the generation of unique receptor phenotypes that can readily be detected pharmacologically in both radioligand binding and cell signaling studies (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Google Scholar, 3Christopoulos G. Perry K.J. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Gao Y. Fraser N.J.

Ther. 2000; 294: 61-72Google Scholar). Because we established a significant interaction between the VPAC1 receptor and each of the RAMPs, we chose to investigate the pharmacological consequences of this association in greater detail to determine whether the VPAC1 receptor phenotype was also altered. For the sake of comparison with our functional experiments (see below), binding assays were conducted on both membrane homogenates and whole cells. Saturation binding experiments using125I-VIP as the radioligand revealed no significant effect of co-expression of RAMPs on the maximal density of cell surface VPAC1 receptor binding sites when compared with those determined in the absence of RAMP (not shown). Table Ishows the results of subsequent competition binding assays between125I-VIP and a variety of low and high affinity VPAC1 receptor ligands. Unlike their behavior with either the CTR or CL receptor, the association of RAMPs with the VPAC1 receptor did not cause a significant alteration in the binding properties of the receptor in either whole cells or membranes (Table I).Table ILigand potency estimatesAgonist1-aAdditional competition experiments using secretin or GHRH (100 nm, membranes; 1 μm, whole cells) as competitor had no effect on specific125I-VIP binding.VIPPACAP-27PACAP-38HeloderminPHI-27Membranes1-bDifferences in pIC50 values for whole cells and membranes likely reflect the presence of excess guanine nucleotide in whole cells.

The VPAC1 receptor is known to couple promiscuously to different classes of G proteins, leading to the intracellular stimulation of cAMP accumulation and PI hydrolysis (20Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.-C Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Google Scholar). We chose to quantify the generation of these second messengers in response to VPAC1 receptor agonists in the absence or presence of co-transfection of RAMPs to determine the effect of receptor-RAMP interaction on the signaling properties of the VPAC1 receptor. Initial experiments utilized a single concentration, at an approximate EC50 value, of a variety of VPAC1 receptor agonists (Fig. 2, A and B,left panels) and compared the responses of these agonists with agonists acting via the CTR (Fig. 2, A andB, right panels). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the co-expression of the VPAC1 receptor and RAMP2 led to a significant enhancement of the PI response to the VPAC1 receptor agonists. Although there was a slight enhancement in the PI response when the receptor was co-expressed with RAMP3, it was not statistically significant. In contrast, the cAMP response mediated by the VPAC1 receptor was not significantly affected by co-expression of any of the RAMPs (Fig. 2 B). When similar experiments were performed with the CTR and its agonists, no selective augmentation of the PI response by any of the RAMPs was noted (Fig. 2 A). In subsequent experiments, we established complete concentration-response curves to VIP for both PI and cAMP accumulation. Fig. 2 C shows that the potency of VIP to mediate PI hydrolysis remained unaltered, whereas the maximal response was significantly enhanced in the presence of RAMP2. When VIP-mediated cAMP accumulation was investigated, there was no significant effect of RAMP2-VPAC1 receptor co-expression on either the maximal agonist response or agonist potency. The lack of change in agonist potency is consistent with our competition binding data in which no change in ligand affinity was observed. To ensure that the augmented PI response seen with RAMP2 was not due to increased cell surface receptor expression, additional experiments were performed in which N-terminally FLAG-tagged VPAC1 receptors were co-transfected with each of the RAMPs and both 125I-VIP and125I-IgG binding (to detect anti-FLAG antibody as an independent measure of cell surface-expressed receptor) were assessed in parallel. No significant difference was observed in either125I-VIP binding or anti-FLAG antibody binding, confirming that co-expression with RAMPs did not modify the levels of cell surface-expressed receptor. Taken together, these findings indicate that the association of RAMP2 and the VPAC1 receptor differentially affects the coupling efficiency of the receptor through different signal transduction pathways. Importantly, the effect of RAMPs on intracellular signal strength is receptor specific, with no parallel modulation of CTR-mediated PI hydrolysis found. Thus, we have identified a novel behavior of RAMPs that is distinct from their effect on expression of receptor phenotype. The finding that PI signal strength is specifically augmented by RAMP2 is highly relevant because the classic coupling pathway associated with VPAC1 receptor activation in a number of cell and tissue types has always been the stimulation of cAMP accumulation via coupling to Gs proteins; receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis is either weakly stimulated or not observable (20Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.-C Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Google Scholar). Our finding of a selective enhancement of the VPAC1 receptor PI response in the presence of RAMP2 is one possible mechanism that would explain some of the contradictory results observed in other studies of VPAC1 receptor signaling. Specifically, the endogenous RAMP complement may exert a hitherto unappreciated impact on the signaling efficiency of the VPAC1 receptor. Important questions remain regarding the functional roles of the VPAC1-RAMP1, VPAC1-RAMP3, PTH1-RAMP2, glucagon receptor-RAMP2, and PTH2-RAMP3 complexes that we have identified. In the case of the VPAC1-RAMP1 heterodimers, despite very potent translocation of RAMP1 to the cell surface and reduction of RAMP1 homodimerization (not shown), we were unable to observe any obvious effects on receptor binding or classic signal pathways such as cAMP or PI accumulation. However, this does not mean that the complexes are pharmacologically indistinguishable from the VPAC1 receptor monomer. For example, the VPAC1-RAMP1 complexes may display altered trafficking properties, altered protein-protein interactions, or differential signaling through other intracellular pathways. Indeed, it is now clear that ligand efficacy is manifested in a variety of both classic and nonclassic modes (21Kenakin T. Nat. Rev. Drug Discover. 2002; 1: 103-110Google Scholar), and thus RAMP-receptor complexes may impact upon these modes to differing extents. In conclusion, we have provided evidence for the direct interaction of RAMPs with four new receptor partners, thus illustrating for the first time that RAMP-receptor complexing extends to receptors beyond those activated by the calcitonin family of peptides. The ability of RAMP2 to augment VPAC1 receptor signaling with no concurrent alteration in cAMP identifies a new functional consequence of RAMP-receptor interactions and suggests that RAMPs may play a more general role in modulating cell signaling through other GPCRs than is currently appreciated.

Epstein-Barr virus phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumor necrosis factor receptor tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors green fluorescent protein tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)1 is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus associated with the development of both lymphoid and epithelial tumors. As a common virus infection, EBV appears to have evolved to exploit the process of B cell development to persist as a lifelong asymptomatic infection. However, the virus can contribute to oncogenesis as evidenced by its frequent detection in certain tumors, namely Burkitt's lymphoma, post-transplant B cell lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and by its unique ability to efficiently transform resting B cells in vitro into permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines (1Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.N. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar). These transforming effects are associated with the restricted expression of EBV genes such that only a subset of so-called latent virus proteins are expressed in virus-infected tumors and in lymphoblastoid cell lines. The full complement of eight latent genes comprising six nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and two membrane proteins (LMP1 and LMP2) are expressed only in post-transplant B cell tumors and in lymphoblastoid cell lines whereas different forms of latency are manifest in Burkitt's lymphoma (EBNA1 only) and in Hodgkin's disease and NPC (EBNA1, LMP1, and LMP2). These distinct forms of EBV latency appear to be a vestige of the pattern of latent gene expression used by the virus during the establishment of persistent infection within the B cell pool (2Thorley-Lawson D.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Key to the ability of EBV to efficiently colonize memory B cells is the expression of LMP1 and LMP2 both of which provide essential survival signals. The aberrant adoption of these forms of latency can contribute to transformation as evidenced by expression of LMP1 and LMP2 in NPC and Hodgkin's disease. LMP1 is the major transforming protein of EBV behaving as a classical oncogene in rodent fibroblast transformation assays and being essential for EBV-induced B cell transformation in vitro (3Wang D.

Recent studies have demonstrated that LMP1 functions as a constitutively activated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily activating a number of signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner (10Gires O. Zimber-Strobl U. Gonnella R. Ueffing M. Marschall G. Zeidler R. Pich D. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11Kilger E. Kieser A. Baumann M. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1700-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Functionally, LMP1 resembles CD40, a member of the TNFR, and can partially substitute for CD40 in vivo providing both growth and differentiation responses in B cells (12Uchida J. Yasui T. Takaoka-Shichijo Y. Muraoka M. Kulwichit W. Raab-Traub N. Kikutani H. Science. 1999; 286: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The LMP1 protein is an integral membrane protein of 63 kDa and can be subdivided into three domains: (a) a NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1–23) that tethers and orientates the LMP1 protein to the plasma membrane, (b) six hydrophobic transmembrane loops that are involved in self-aggregation and oligomerization (amino acids 24–186), and (c) a long COOH-terminal cytoplasmic region (amino acids 187–386) that possesses most of the signaling activity of the molecule. Two distinct functional domains referred to as COOH-terminal activation regions 1 and 2 (CTAR1 and CTAR2) have been identified on the basis of their ability to activate the NF-κB transcription factor pathway (13Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). This effect contributes to the many phenotypic consequences of LMP1 expression including the induction of various anti-apoptotic and cytokine genes. LMP1 is also able to engage the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade resulting in activation of extracellular-regulated protein kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 and to stimulate the JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway (9Eliopoulos A.G.

Many of these effects result from the ability of TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) to interact either directly with CTAR1 or indirectly via the death domain protein TRADD to CTAR2 (1Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.N. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar). The binding of TRAFs to the multimerized cytoplasmic tails of LMP1 provides a platform for the assembly and activation of upstream signaling molecules including the NIK and Tpl-2 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (18Sylla B.S.

The region between CTAR1 and CTAR2 (so-called CTAR3) has been suggested to be responsible for the JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway although other data refute this finding and deletion of this region has no effect of the efficiency of B cell transformation (17Gires O.

The expression of LMP1 in NPC is associated with increased metastatic spread, an effect that is also reflected in the ability of LMP1 to induce increased cell motility and invasive growth when expressed in epithelial cells in vitro (21Fahraeus R.

Thus it appears that the transforming ability of LMP1 may be regulated by novel signaling pathways that, in addition to the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, may account for the ability of this molecule to influence cell motility and to provide a profound survival advantage. One pathway that fulfils these criteria is that mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which via generation of specific phospholipids, activates a diverse range of cellular processes including cell growth, motility, adhesion, and survival (26Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5100) Google Scholar). The PI3K family of enzymes is activated by a wide range of extracellular growth and mitogenic stimuli including ligands of the TNFR family such as TNF-α and CD40, thus suggesting that LMP1 may also target this pathway (27Andjelic S.

PI3K-generated phospholipids are responsible for activating the Akt (PKB) kinase thereby promoting cell survival and for regulating the Rho family of small GTPases resulting in effects on the actin cytoskeleton and on cell signaling. Here we demonstrate that LMP1 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway and that this effect is responsible for LMP1-induced actin polymerization, morphological transformation, and also contributes to cell survival. Furthermore, we show that the region of LMP1 previously identified as being essential for EBV-induced B cell transformation, CTAR1, is also responsible for PI3K activation. 293RcRLMP1 cells carrying an ecdysone-regulatable LMP1 gene have been described previously (9Eliopoulos A.G.

LMP1 expression was induced in 293RcLMP1 cells after the addition of 10 μm muristerone A (Invitrogen). HeLa cell clones stably expressing LMP1 have been described previously (15Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml mycophenloic acid, 20 μg/ml xanthine, and 10 μg/ml hypoxanthine. Rat-1 cells carrying the gpt selectable marker or stably expressing LMP1 were generated after transfection of Rat-1 cells with either pSV2gpt or the LMP1 expression vector, pSV2MTLM. Rat-1 cells stably expressing a chimeric RatCD2:LMP1 have been described previously (9Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Blake S.M. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16085-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). 106 cells seeded into each well of a 6-well plate (Nunc) were serum-starved for 24 h prior to cross-linking. Briefly, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml anti-RatCD2 (OX34) followed by a 1/2000 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako). At various times after cross-linking, cells were recovered in lysis buffer and snap frozen prior to analysis. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 5 × 103-104 cells were seeded onto each well of a Teflon-coated microscope slide (Hendley-Essex) in 100 μl of medium. After overnight attachment, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium and the cells incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were microinjected with pSG5-based expression vectors containing wild-type LMP1 (pSG5-LMP1), or mutant LMP1 proteins carrying a defective CTAR1 domain (pSG5-LMP1AAA), defective CTAR2 domain (pSG5-LMP1378Stop), or defective CTAR1 and CTAR2 domains (pSG5-LMP1AAA/378Stop). These mutants have been described previously (9Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Blake S.M. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16085-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For certain experiments, cells were co-microinjected with wild-type LMP1 (pSG5-LMP1) and expression vectors containing dominant negative forms of Cdc42 (pRK5-Myc-N17Cdc42), Rac (pRK5-Myc-N17Rac), or Rho (pRK5-Myc-N17Rho) (kind gifts from Professor Alan Hall, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK). Expression vectors containing a constitutively active PI3K (p110 CAAX ) or a dominant-negative p85 were kind gifts from Dr. Julian Downward, ICRF, London, UK. p110 CAAX encodes the catalytic subunit of type IA PI3K linked to a CAAX membrane targeting motif of Ras. Dominant-negative p85 encodes a wild-type p85 regulatory subunit deleted for the amino-terminal Src homology 2 domain. To evaluate PI3K activation in microinjected cells, pSG5-based LMP1 expression vectors were co-microinjected with an expression vector carrying a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged GRP1 PH domain fusion protein (29Gray A. Van Der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Between 3 and 5 h after microinjection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and visualized under UV fluorescence for evidence of membrane targeting of the GFP tag. In each experiment, at least 200 cells were microinjected; each experiment was performed at least three times. Between 3 and 5 h after microinjection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were immunostained for LMP1 expression using the LMP1-specific monoclonal antibody OTT22C (a kind gift from Dr. J. Middledorp, Netherlands) and Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Filamentous actin was visualized using a 1/400 dilution of TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Subconfluent cultures were lysed in an Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 400 μg of cleared total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with either 15 μl of anti-p85 (Serotec) or 25 μl of anti-LMP1 (CS1–4). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and immune complexes captured after a further 2-h incubation with protein A-agarose (Sigma). After 4 washes in cold lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of gel sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking, membranes were probed with either a monoclonal antibody to LMP1 (S12), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody to p85 (Upstate Biotechnology). Bound antibody was detected using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). PI3K activity was assayed as described (30Kanda S. Hodgkin M.N. Woodfield R.J. Wakelam M.J. Thomas G. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23347-52353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to lysis in an Nonidet P-40-based buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). In some cases, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 or 10% fetal calf serum for the indicated times (5–10 min). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 monoclonal antibody U13 (Serotec). Protein A-Sepharose immune complexes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, once with phosphate-buffered saline, once with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m LiCl, once with distilled water, and once with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The beads were suspended in 50 μl of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Sigma), sonicated for 5 min at 20 °C, and preincubated at 20 °C for 10 min. Twenty μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and MgCl2(final concentration, 10 mm) were added, and samples were further incubated for 20 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol, 11.6 m HCl (50:100:1), phospholipids were extracted with chloroform, and the organic phase was washed with methanol, 1 m HCl (1:1). Reaction products were concentrated in vacuo, dissolved in chloroform, spotted on Silica Gel-60 plates (Merck) impregnated with 1 potassium oxalate, and resolved by chromatography in chloroform/methanol, 28% ammonia/water (43:38:5:7) for 45 min. Phosphorylated products were detected by Image Analyzer (Amersham Biosciences) and then exposed on x-ray films (Kodak). Akt kinase assays were carried out according to the manufacturers instructions (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 200 μg of total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated overnight with immobilized mouse anti-Akt IgG. After washing in two changes of lysis buffer and three changes of kinase assay buffer, the beads were resuspended in kinase assay buffer containing 1 μg of GSK3 peptide substrate and 10 μmATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 20 μl of gel sample buffer. Supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking, membranes were probed with a phospho-GSK3 specific antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Bound antibody was detected using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cell viability was measured using the AlamarBlueTM Assay (Serotec). Briefly, cells were plated out at 5 × 103 cells/well in triplicate on a 96-well plate and left overnight. Cell viability was analyzed at 72 h post-treatment with or without 20 μm LY294002. AlamarBlueTM was added aseptically at 10% of the culture volume, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured with excitation wavelength at 560 nm and emission wavelength at 590 nm. For detection of apoptosis, cells were stained with acridine orange. Vector control or LMP1-expressing clones were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells per well. 24 h later, medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 20 μm LY294002 or Me2SO vehicle control. Cells were cultured for an additional 72 h after which time they were recovered as single cell suspensions. Cells were examined for evidence of apoptosis after incubation of cell suspensions with 5 μg/ml acridine orange followed by microscopic analysis. The recent demonstration that a number of TNFR family members such as CD40, TNFR1, and TRANCE-R engage the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway prompted us to investigate whether LMP1 could also activate this pathway. For both CD40 and the TRANCE receptor, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to the activated receptor complex after receptor ligation (31Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 32Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Wong B.R. Naramura M. Kim N., Gu, H. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30011-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Given that LMP1 behaves as a constitutively activated TNF receptor, it was reasoned that PI3K would associate with LMP1 in a constitutive manner. Thus immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HeLa cells stably expressing LMP1 to determine whether PI3K formed part of the LMP1 signaling complex (Fig. 1). LMP1 was efficiently immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells (Fig. 1 A) and these immunoprecipitates were found to contain a significant proportion of p85 when probed with a specific p85 antibody (Fig. 1 B). The reciprocal analysis using p85 immunoprecipitates confirmed the interaction with LMP1 (Fig. 1 D) and demonstrated a diminished ability to immunoprecipitate p85 in LMP1-expressing cells (Fig. 1 C). This may result from the LMP1-p85 interaction reducing the efficiency of p85α antibody binding as total cellular levels of p85 were unaltered in LMP1-expressing cells (data not shown). To directly examine the ability of LMP1 to activate PI3K, the basal level of PI3K activity was measured in three independent HeLa clones stably expressing LMP1. These cells were serum-starved for 24 h and the ability of immunoprecipitated PI3K (p85 immunoprecipitates) to phosphorylate PI, assayed by lipid kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the basal levels of PI3K activity were up to 2-fold greater in LMP1-expressing clones compared with two vector control transfectants. The elevated PI3K activity in LMP1-expressing cells correlated with activation of Akt as determined using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes Akt phosphorylated on serine 473 (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that LMP1 expression resulted in activation of Akt, in vitro kinase assays were performed using Akt immunoprecipitates and a GSK3 peptide as substrate. These assays demonstrated significantly higher levels of basal Akt activity in LMP1-expressing HeLa cells compared with vector controls and this activity was inhibited by the LY290042 compound confirming the dependence of this effect on PI3K (Fig. 2 C). Identical results were obtained using A431 cells stably expressing LMP1 (data not shown). The constitutively active nature of LMP1 can obscure the impact of this protein on cell signaling pathways. To overcome this problem, an ecdysone-inducible system was generated to provide regulatable expression of LMP1. In this system, binding of the steroid hormone Muristerone A to a hybrid ecdysone-modified retinoic acid receptor allows the subsequent activation of an ecdysone-responsive target gene. HEK 293 cells carrying the pVgRXR plasmid (293EcR), which encodes the receptor subunits, and pIND-LMP1, which contains the LMP1 cDNA under the control of ecdysone-responsive elements, were generated. A tightly regulatable clone was identified that demonstrated induction of LMP1 expression after 6 h of Muristerone A treatment with steadily increasing LMP1 levels up to 48 h post-treatment and no LMP1 expression in cells not treated with the hormone (Fig. 3 A). This induction of LMP1 expression correlated temporally with increased PI3K activity which at 6–48 h post-treatment was 2–3-fold higher than that observed in non-LMP1 expressing cells (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with this increase in PI3K activity, induction of LMP1 resulted in phosphorylation of p85, which was evident as early as 3 h after induction and remained elevated at 12 h (Fig. 3 C). Likewise, Akt activity as determined by phosphorylation at serine 473 was induced after 3 h and increased steadily over 24 h in concert with PI3K activity (Fig. 3 D). To rule out the possibility that hormone treatment of 293 cells resulted in PI3K/Akt activation, parental 293 RXR cells lacking pIND LMP1 were serum-starved prior to treatment with 10 μm Muristerone A. Muristerone treatment of these cells failed to induce either PI3K activity or Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). To determine whether membrane oligomerization of LMP1 is an essential requirement for PI3K/Akt activation, we used of an expression system in which a chimeric RatCD2-LMP1 chimera can be induced to signal after the addition of antibodies to CD2 and subsequent cross-linking with anti-mouse IgG (9Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Blake S.M. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16085-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). As the chimeric molecule lacks the amino terminus and transmembrane spanning regions of LMP1, this approach also allowed us to assess the contribution of the cytosolic COOH terminus to LMP1-induced PI3K/Akt activation. Treatment of Rat-1 cells stably expressing the Rat CD2-LMP1 chimera with the anti-CD2 mAb (OX34) and cross-linking anti-mouse immunoglobulin G induced Akt phosphorylation within 30 min and this continued to increase for up to 24 h (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with the increase in Akt activity, an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of GSK-3 (p-GSK3) demonstrated phosphorylation of this Akt substrate after CD2 engagement (Fig. 4 B) and this effect was further confirmed by in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 4 C). Pretreatment of Rat CD2LMP1-expressing cells with LY294002 significantly reduced Akt phosphorylation induced by CD2 engagement (Fig. 4 D). To rule out the possibility that antibody treatment alone of cells could contribute to PI3K/Akt activation, a neomycin-resistant Rat-1 cell clone, Rat-1 neo clone 2, was incubated in the presence of the Rat CD2 monoclonal antibody and subsequent cross-linking with ant-mouse IgG. Unlike the Rat CD2LMP1-expressing cells, treatment of the Rat-1 neo cells with anti-CD2 and anti-mouse IgG failed to induce either PI3K activity or Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). These data demonstrate that LMP1 oligomerization is required for activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and that this activation is mediated by the LMP1 cytoplasmic domain. To identify the domain within the LMP1 cytoplasmic tail that is responsible for PI3K/Akt activation, we made use of an expression vector, pPH-GRP1-GFP, comprising GFP fused to the PH domain of the GRP1 protein. The PH domain of GRP1 is a specific receptor for 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositide lipids (phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,-bisphosphate (PI3-4P2)) generated as a consequence of PI3K activity and, as a GFP fusion, can be used to monitor the PI3K activity at the cell"

Whereas there is growing evidence that there are TGF-β type I receptor-initiated intracellular pathways that are distinct from the pivotal Smad pathway, their physiological importance in TGF-β signaling is not well understood. Therefore, we generated TGF-β type I receptors (also termed ALK5s) with mutations in the L45 loop of the kinase domain, termed ALK5(D266A) and ALK5(3A). These mutants showed retained kinase activity but were unable to activate Smads. Characterization of their signaling properties revealed that the two L45 loop mutants did not mediate Smad-dependent transcriptional responses, TGF-β-induced growth inhibition, and fibronectin and plasminogen activator-1 production in R4-2 mink lung epithelial cells lacking functional ALK5 protein.

This suggests that the L45 loop in the kinase domain is important for docking of other binding proteins. Interestingly, JNK MAP kinase activity was found to be activated by the ALK5(3A) mutant in various cell types. In addition, TGF-β-induced inhibition of cyclin D1 expression and stimulation of PMEPA1 (androgen-regulated prostatic mRNA) expression were found to occur, albeit weakly, in an Smad-independent manner in normal murine mammary gland cells.

TGF-β family members, which include TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins, were found to possess critical roles during embryogenesis and in maintaining tissue homeostasis during adult life. Deregulated TGF-β family signaling has been implicated in multiple developmental disorders and in various human diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, and auto-immune diseases (2Massagué J Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). TGF-β family members transduce their signals across the plasma membrane by inducing the formation of heteromeric complexes of specific type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). The type I receptor is phosphorylated and activated by the type II receptor (4Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar) and initiates intracellular signaling through activation of downstream signaling components, including the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated (R)-Smad proteins at their extreme C-terminal serine residues. Using chimeric TGF-β family receptors, the exposed L45 loop, a nine-amino acid sequence between kinase subdomains IV and V, was found to be important in determining the signaling specificity of type I receptors (5Feng X.-H.

Accordingly, Smad2 and Smad3 act downstream of TGF-β and activin type I receptors, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are phosphorylated by bone morphogenetic protein type I receptors. A number of proteins with anchoring, scaffolding, and/or chaperone activity have been identified that regulate the recruitment of Smads to the type I-type II receptor complex, including Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) (9Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) and Disabled-2 (Dab-2) (10Hocevar B.A. Smine A., Xu, X.-X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Whether these components or other identified TGF-β receptor-binding proteins may play a role in presentation of other substrates besides Smads remains to be explored. Activated R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with common partner (Co)-Smad, i.e. Smad4, which accumulates in the nucleus, where they control gene expression of genes involved ine.g. growth inhibition, apoptosis, migration, and extracellular matrix production (11ten Dijke P. Goumans M.-J. Itoh F. Itoh S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Whereas Smads have been identified as pivotal intracellular effectors for TGF-β, there is growing evidence that additional pathways are activated downstream of TGF-β receptors (11ten Dijke P. Goumans M.-J. Itoh F. Itoh S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which these responses are transduced and their physiological significance in TGF-β signaling have remained poorly characterized. Members of the small GTP-binding proteins, including Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, have been reported to become activated by TGF-β and to potentiate TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation (12Mucsi I.

Interestingly, the TGF-β-induced expression of fibronectin and inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 or NOV, a secreted glycoprotein, were shown to require JNK activation but to be independent of Smad pathways (29Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L.

In addition, TGF-β-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase was shown to induce ATF-2 phosphorylation, which acted synergistically with Smads in transcriptional activation (38Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S.

In contrast, activation of extracellular-regulated kinase MAP kinase has also been shown to induce the phosphorylation in the linker region of R-Smads and, thereby, to inhibit the ligand-induced nuclear accumulation of R-Smads (39Kretzschmar M.

To investigate the pathways that are activated in the absence of Smad activation we have generated a TGF-β type I receptor (ALK5) with mutations in the L45 loop of the kinase domain that are defective in Smad activation and characterized the signaling properties of these mutated type I receptors. All of L45 mutants in human ALK5 were made by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pCDNA3-ALK5/HA and pCDNA3-caALK5/HA as templates. pMEP-ALK5/HA, pMEP-ALK5(D266A)/HA, and pMEP-ALK5(3A)/HA were constructed by ligation of the insert from pCDNA3-ALK5/HA or its mutants with pMEP4 (Invitrogen). The chimeric constructs between GM-CSF αR and ALK5 (pNAαI) and between GM-CSF βR and TβR-II (pHa-βII) were provided by Dr. E. B. Leof (42Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol.

To create chimeric constructs between human GM-CSF αR and human ALK5/HA, the intracellular domain of ALK5 from pNAαI was substituted into the corresponding domain of ALK5 from pCDNA3-ALK5/HA or its mutants. Subsequently, the inserts of chimeric constructs were ligated into the LZRS-pBMN-ms(-IRES)-eGFP retroviral vector constructed from LZRS-pBMN-LacZ, which was obtained from Dr. G. Nolan. pBabe-βRII, a retroviral expression vector of the chimeric construct between human GM-CSF βR and human TβR-II, was constructed by ligating the insert from pHa-βII to pBabe (43Morgenstern J.P.

Davis, respectively. pFA2-cJun, pFA-CHOP, pAP-1-Luc, and pFR-Luc were purchased from Stratagene. To create adenoviruses for ALK5/HA or ALK5(3A)/HA, the insert of pCDNA3-ALK5/HA or pCDNA3- ALK5(3A)/HA was ligated into pAdTrack-CMV (53He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). After recombination of pAdTrack-CMV-ALK5/HA or pAdTrack-CMV-ALK5(3A)/HA with pAdEasy-1, the obtained plasmids were transfected into 293T cells, then adenoviruses were amplified. 293T and Phoenix-A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen) and 1×MEM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). Mv1Lu, R4-2, MDA-MB-468, and COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Mouse NMuMG breast epithelial cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 10 μg/ml insulin. For selection of stable transformants with pMEP4 in R4-2 and retroviral vectors in NMuMG, the cells were cultured in the presence of 400 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) and 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), respectively. Phoenix-A cells (4 × 106/10 cm dish) were transfected with 20 μg of retroviral expression plasmid with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The next day the cells were reseeded in a 175-cm2 flask and subsequently cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week. After confluence, the cells were grown in 15 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS without drug selection for 16 h. This culture medium was used as a source for retrovirus after filtration. For retroviral infection, NMuMG cells (2 × 106/10 cm dish) were infected with 5 ml of cultured medium containing pBabe-βRII retrovirus in the presence of 10 μg/ml DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After selection with 5 μg/ml puromycin, βRII-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using anti-human GM-CSF βR monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and R-phycoerythrin goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (Molecular Probes). Then, βRII-positive cells were collected and cultured. Subsequently, βRII-expressing cells were infected with LZRS-pBMN-ms(-IRES)-eGFP-αALK5/HA, LZRS-pBMN-ms(-IRES)-eGFP-αALK5(D266A)/HA, LZRS-pBMN-ms(-IRES)-eGFP-αALK5(3A)/HA, or LZRS-pBMN-ms(-IRES)-eGFP by the above procedure. Because the expression of αALK5 or its mutants is linked to that of GFP, both GFP- and βRII-positive cells were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter to get double-positive cells. One day before transfection Mv1Lu or R4-2 cells were seeded at 4.0 × 105cells/well in 12-well plates. The cells were transfected using FuGENE 6. Where indicated, TGF-β3 was added into the dishes 24 h after transfection. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.3% FCS for 18 h. In all experiments, β-galactosidase (pCH110,Amersham Biosciences) activity was measured to normalize for transfection efficiency. Each transfection was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice. To detect Smad2 phosphorylation by constitutively active (ca) ALK5 or its mutant derivatives in COS7 cells, 3 μg of pDEF3-FLAG-Smad2 and 3 μg of caALK5 or its mutant derivatives were transfected in COS7 cells at 1.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish using FuGENE 6. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmsodium vanadate, 40 mm NaF, and 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate). The cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with FLAG M5 antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the immunoprecipitates with lysis buffer three times, the proteins in immunoprecipitates and aliquots of total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was subsequently probed with phosphorylated Smad2-specific antibodies (pS2) (8Persson U. Izumi H. Souchelnytskyi S. Itoh S. Grimsby S. Engström U. Heldin C.-H. Funa K. ten Dijke P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) or FLAG M5 antibody. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and chemiluminescent substrate. The expression of ALK5 receptors was determined by immunoprecipitation of the [35S]cysteine/methionine-labeled cells (44Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K.

The detection of the interactions between caALK5 and I-Smads, between caALK5 and XIAP, or between ALK5 and Dab-2 was performed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting according to the above method, except that cells were lysed in TNE buffer (10 mmTris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 40 mm NaF, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). The expression of proteins in R4-2 or NMuMG stable transformants was detected by Western blotting of total cell lysates in TNE buffer. pS2 antibody for phosphorylated Smad2, anti-Smad2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) for total Smad2, anti-HA12CA5 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for ALK5 or αALK5 chimera, and anti-GM-CSF βR antibody for βRII chimera were used as primary antibodies. One day before transfection, COS7 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 105cells/3.5-cm dish. The cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pCDNA3-caALK5/HA or its mutant derivatives by FuGENE 6. Forty hours later, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer, precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads, and incubated with anti-HA12CA5 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added to the reaction mixture, and incubation was continued another 30 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer three times and with the kinase reaction buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmMnCl2) twice and then incubated with kinase reaction buffer containing 14.8 kBq/ml [γ-32P]ATP (AmershamBiosciences) for 30 min at 25 °C. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. The expression of receptor proteins was determined by35S-metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation (44Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M.

R4-2 transformants were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Before the addition of TGF-β3, the cells were simultaneously treated (or not treated) with 100 μm ZnCl2 to induce ALK5 expression. Two hours before harvest, the cells were pulsed with 18.5 kBq of [methyl-3H]thymidine (AmershamBiosciences) in 0.5 ml of culture medium. The cells were fixed with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for more than 20 min and washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with water. Solubilization of the cells was done in 400 μl of 0.1 m NaOH for 20 min at room temperature. The 3H radioactivity incorporated into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well in medium containing 100 μm ZnCl2. After 18 h, the medium was changed to cysteine/methionine-free medium (Invitrogen) with 100 μm ZnCl2 in the presence of 10 ng/ml TGF-β3, and the incubation was prolonged for another 4 h. During the last 2 h, cells were incubated with 148 kBq/ml 35S-labeling mixture ProMix (AmershamBiosciences). The cells were removed by washing on ice, once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 3 times in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, twice in 2 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and once in PBS. Extracellular matrix proteins were scraped off, extracted into SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Plasminogen activator-1 (PAI-1) was identified as a 45-kDa protein in the extracellular matrix fraction (54Laiho M. Rönnstrand L. Heino J. Decaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 972-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of fibronectin, R4-2 transformants were seeded at 1.0 × 106cells/6-well plate. After 18 h, the cells were cultured in the presence of 100 μm ZnCl2 for 5 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was changed to DMEM containing 0.3% FCS and 100 μm ZnCl2 with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β3. After 16 h, the medium was changed to 1 ml of cysteine/methionine-free medium containing 100 μmZnCl2 and 74 kBq/ml 35S-labeling mixture ProMix with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β3. Two hours later, 0.5 ml of culture medium was collected into the tube and incubated with 100 μl of gelatin-Sepharose (50% slurry in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl; Amersham Biosciences) and 30 μl of 10% Triton X-100 for 16 h at 4 °C. Fibronectin is known to bind strongly to gelatin (55Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J.

The beads were successively washed once with solution A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mmNaCl), once with solution B (50 mm Tris (pH7.4) and 500 mm NaCl), and once again with solution A. Gelatin-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. JNK activation was determined by an immune complex kinase assay using GST-c-Jun 1–135 as a substrate (56Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). 293T cells were seeded at 6.0 × 106/10 cm dish 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected with 3 μg of FLAG-JNK1α or 3 μg of caALK5/HA or its mutant derivatives by FuGENE 6. After 40 h, cells were lysed in 1 ml of TNE buffer. The cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated with FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the reaction mixture, and incubation was prolonged another 30 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with TNE buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and 3 times with 2× assay buffer (40 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 4 mm EGTA, 20"
https://openalex.org/W2038794428,"The 97-kDa valosin-containing protein (p97-VCP) plays a role in a wide variety of cellular activities, many of which are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome (Ub-Pr)-mediated degradation pathway. We previously demonstrated that VCP binds to multi-ubiquitin chains and may act as a molecular chaperone that targets the ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for degradation. In this report, we show that although the ubiquitin chain-binding activity, carried out by the N-terminal 200 residues (N domain), is necessary for the degradation of proteasome substrates, it is not sufficient. Using in vitro degradation assays, we demonstrated that the entire VCP molecule, consisting of the N domain and two ATPase domains D1 and D2, is required for mediating the Ub-Pr degradation. The ATPase activity of VCP requires Mg2+, and is stimulated by high temperature. Under optimal conditions, VCP hydrolyzes ATP with a K m of ∼0.33 mmand a V max of ∼0.52 nmol Pi min−1 μg−1. At a physiological temperature, mutation in D2 significantly inhibits the ATPase activity, while that in D1 has little effect. Interestingly, mutations in D1, but not D2, abolish the heat-stimulated ATPase activity. Thus, we provide the first demonstration that the ATPase activity of VCP is required for mediating the Ub-Pr degradation, that D2 accounts for the major ATPase activity, and that D1 contributes to the heat-induced activity.

Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 2Maurizi M.R. Li C.C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family members are characterized by the presence of either one (type I) or two (type II) conserved ATPase domains, also referred to as AAA modules. The 200–250-amino acid AAA module encompasses the consensus Walker A (GxxxxGKT, x = any amino acid) and Walker B (hhhhDExx, h = hydrophobic residue) motifs (5Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar) that are critical for ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. It is generally thought that the AAA proteins act as molecular chaperones to assemble or disassemble protein complexes, unfold or unwind macromolecules, and transport cellular cargoes. These chaperone or chaperone-like activities are carried out by the conserved ATPase domains, which provide the needed energy through ATP hydrolysis. VCP is a type II AAA-ATPase. It is highly abundant, accounting for about 1% of the total cellular proteins. It is present in all types of cells in a hexameric ring structure and localizes in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and perimembrane subcompartments (6Peters J.M. Walsh M.J. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). VCP is one of the most evolutionarily conserved genes, sharing high sequence homology from man to yeast and archaebacteria (6Peters J.M. Walsh M.J. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Pamnani V. Tamura T. Lupas A. Peters J. Cejka Z. Ashraf W. Baumeister W.

The high abundance and conservation suggest that VCP plays an important and fundamental role in cellular activities. As other AAA proteins, VCP and its orthologs have been shown to play a role in many seemingly unrelated cellular activities. Remarkably, almost all these activities have been shown to be regulated by the Ub-Pr degradation pathway, suggesting that VCP may play a fundamental role in the pathway, which in turn regulates the diverse activities. We previously showed that VCP is involved in the degradation of a number of Ub-Pr substrates (10Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 11Yen C.H. Yang Y.C. Ruscetti S.K. Kirken R.A. Dai R.M. Li C.C. J.

Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Using in vitro degradation assays, we showed that depletion of VCP from cell extracts resulted in an inhibition of the proteolysis of model substrates, while adding back the recombinant VCP restored the degradation. Thus, VCP is a critical component of the Ub-Pr degradation pathway (10Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4884-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we propose a model whereby VCP acts as a molecular chaperone that targets the ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for degradation, hence regulates diverse cell functions through the Ub-Pr pathway. In agreement with our model, recently a set of papers was published from several laboratories (15Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 16Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell.

Cell. 2001; 12: 4114-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), all showing a critical role for VCP in the degradation of proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In both Ub-Pr-dependent and ER-associated degradation, VCP is believed to dissociate the ubiquitinated substrates from protein complexes or ER membrane, and the dissociation is presumably powered by the ATPase activity of VCP. As Ub-Pr and ER-associated degradation is the underlying cause of many diseases, it is of high importance to study the detailed mechanism of VCP functions, especially its ATPase activity. The VCP molecule can be divided into three parts: the N-terminal 200 residues, named N domain, and two conserved ATPase domains, D1 and D2. We previously showed that the N domain is responsible for multiubiquitin chain binding, and this activity is necessary in mediating the in vitro degradation (10Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Whether this substrate binding activity is sufficient for mediating the Ub-Pr degradation is not known. In other words, whether the D1 and D2 ATPase domains of VCP are also required in Ub-Pr-mediated degradation has not been determined. Most type II AAA members have one ATPase domain with high sequence conservation, and the other with divergent sequences. It has been shown in NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor), a prototype AAA protein, that the highly conserved D1 domain is responsible for the ATPase activity, while the less conserved D2 domain is responsible for oligomerization (22Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both D1 and D2 domains of VCP are highly similar to each other as well as to the D1 of NSF (23Swaffield J.C. Purugganan M.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), implicating that both have the potential of being an active ATPase. It is, therefore, of high interests to characterize the ATPase activity of VCP and to identify the specific functions of the two ATPase domains. In this study, we performed in vitro degradation assays to show that, in addition to the substrate-binding N domain, the ATPase domains of VCP are also required in mediating the Ub-Pr degradation. We systematically characterize the ATPase activity of VCP and provide the first evidence that the two domains are not catalytically equal: D2 is responsible for the major enzyme activity at physiological temperature, whereas D1 is involved in the regulation of heat-induced ATPase activity. All VCP mutants were derived from the wild type (WT) VCP-His6 fusion construct. ND1 (kindly provided by A. Shaw) (24Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) deletion mutants, containing only the D1 and D2 ATPase domain, respectively, have been described previously. All the site-specific mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Basically, two types of mutants were made. A-type mutant harbors a mutation at the ATP-binding site in the Walker A motif where an invariant lysine is replaced with a threonine. B-type mutant harbors a mutation at the ATP hydrolysis site in the Walker B motif where a glutamic acid is changed to a glutamine. Mutations were introduced into either D1 or D2 ATPase domain, or both. The following oligonucleotides (underlined sequence indicates the triplet codon for the mutated amino acid) and their corresponding complimentary strands (not shown) were used in the PCR cloning for individual mutants: A1-His, 5′-TATGGGCCTCCTGGGCCAGGGACGACCCTGATTGCTCGAGCTGTGGCA-3′; A2-His, 5′-TATGGACCTCCTGGCTGTGGGACAACCTTACTGGCTAAAGCCATTGCT-3′; B1-His, 5′-CCTGCTATCATCTTCATCGATCAGCTTGATGCCATTGCACCCAAAAGA-3′; B2-His, 5′-CCCTGTGTACTCTTCTTTGATCAGTTAGATTCAATTGCCAAGGCCCGT-3′. The plasmids carrying VCP variants were transformed into Escherichia colistrain M15[pREP4](QIAexpress system, Qiagen), and protein expression was induced according to the manufacturer. The induced cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture for His-tagged proteins (Sigma, number P8849). The cleared cell lysates were mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and the fusion proteins were step-eluted with the elution buffer (lysis buffer containing 50, 100, 250, or 500 mm imidazole). Repeated affinity purification was often performed to obtain the high-purity product. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with 10% glycerol. His-NSF fusion protein was expressed and purified with similar procedures. The purified proteins were quantified by BCA assay (Pierce) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. In vitroUb-Pr-mediated degradation assays were performed as previously described (10Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Human cyclin E was synthesized in wheat germ lysate-based in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine and used as the test substrate. Untreated S100 (50 μg of protein) isolated from actively growing CA46 cells (25O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Jondle D. Bhatia K. Magrath I. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4776-4780PubMed Google Scholar) and differentially treated S100 preparations were used as the enzyme sources. VCP depletion was carried out by subjecting S100 to immunoprecipitation with equal volume of VCP-4 antiserum (12Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In a typical VCP reconstitution experiment, 1–4 μg of recombinant VCP-His fusion protein was used. The degradation reactions were stopped by boiling in SDS gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer, and autoradiography. Except for specified variations, standard ATPase assays were carried out in the assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm ATP, and 0.5 μm VCP for 15 min at 37 °C. The inorganic phosphate released by ATP hydrolysis was measured as previously described (26Cogan E.B. Birrell G.B. Griffith O.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, VCP was added to 50 μl of assay buffer, the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min, then 400 μl of dye buffer containing 6 mm ammonium heptamolybdate, 120 μm malachite green, 0.06% polyvinyl alcohol, and 4.25% sodium citrate was added. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, 200 μl from each reaction was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured using an ELx800 Universal Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instrument). Reactions performed without VCP were routinely included, and the activity, usually negligible, was subtracted from the respective experimental data. The inorganic phosphate released was calculated based on the absorbance standard curve established by KH2PO4 standards. VCP variants and His-NSF (28Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were affinity-purified to near homogeneity and used in the assays. All assays were repeated at least three times, and the average activities with standard errors of measurement (± S.E.) were presented. Kinetic parameters, K m, V max, and Hill coefficient, were derived using the software Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). We generated a panel of VCP mutants in the form of His fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A, also see Fig. 5 for gene structure). These include full-length, site-specific mutants and deletion mutants containing only the D1 (ND1 construct) or D2 (E construct) ATPase domain. Among the site-specific mutants, mutations were introduced into the Walker A or Walker B motif of each or both of the ATPase domains. In naming these mutants, alphabetical A or B designates the mutation in Walker A or B motif, while numerical 1 or 2 indicates the location of the respective mutation in the first or second ATPase domain. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and all VCP-His fusion variants were expressed in E. coliand affinity-purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 A).Figure 5Schematic representation of VCP variants and summary of the ATPase activities at 37 °C and the heat inducibility at 50 °C. The A-type (K to T) and B-type (E to Q) site-specific mutations are depicted. The ATPase activities at 37 °C (from Fig. 3) are summarized as +++, ++, +, Δ, and −, which indicate high to low activities. The results from the heat inducibility study (from Fig. 4) are also summarized in which + or − indicates the presence or absence of the heat-induced ATPase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously showed that the N domain of VCP directly binds to the multiubiquitin chain of proteasome substrates and is necessary for mediating the Ub-Pr degradation (10Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether VCP serves functions other than substrate binding,i.e. whether other domains of VCP are also necessary for the degradation. We carried out the in vitro degradation assays, which used the S100 fraction isolated from cell extracts as the Ub-Pr enzyme source and in vitro synthesized cyclin E as the test substrate (10Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). As previously demonstrated, when VCP was depleted from S100, cyclin E degradation was inhibited, whereas adding back the recombinant WT VCP restored the degradation (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, when the substrate-binding N domain (N200) and the site-specific mutants (A1A2, B1B2, and A2) were used in the reconstitution, no degradation was restored (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that although the substrate binding activity is necessary for an effective Ub-Pr degradation, it is not sufficient. Functions contributed by the two ATPase domains, D1 and D2, are also required. Interestingly, although adding back mutant A1 did not fully restore the degradation, it reproducibly resulted in significant restoration (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that A1 mutant may still possess partial activity in mediating the degradation. Based on the higher restoration obtained in A1 than in A2, we speculated that D2 domain may contribute more to the ATPase activity of VCP. To directly study the ATPase activity, a colorimetric assay was used to measure the inorganic phosphate (Pi) released from ATP hydrolysis. Because recombinant VCP exhibited comparable activity as purified cellular VCP (data not shown), wild type VCP-His fusion protein (WT in Fig. 1 A) was used to characterize the enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, wild type VCP hydrolyzes ATP in a time-dependent manner, with free phosphate increasing linearly in the initial 30 min. The reaction is dependent on the concentration of ATP, and the enzyme activity is saturated when ATP is greater than 3 mm (Fig. 2 B). The kinetics were modeled using Enzyme Kinetics template from software Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). In the presence of 20 mm magnesium, VCP exhibited aK m of ∼0.33 mm for ATP, aV max of ∼0.52 nmol Pimin−1 μg−1, and a Hill coefficient of 1.2. Since VCP almost always adopts a stable hexameric ring structure (data not shown), the derived Hill coefficient probably suggests a cooperative nature in hydrolyzing ATP among the subunits. Comparison between VCP and NSF revealed that VCP exhibits a near 5-fold activity over NSF (Fig. 2 C) under our experimental condition. The activity is VCP dose-dependent up to 1 mm and displays a sigmoid kinetic profile (Fig. 2 D), probably reflecting the activities of the two ATPase domains. The ATPase activity requires the presence of divalent cations, e.g.Mg2+ (Fig. 2 E). Although Mn2+ and Co2+ at a low concentration also moderately support the ATPase activity, other biologically relevant divalent cations including Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ do not (Fig. 2 E). Titration experiments further determine the optimum concentration for Mg2+ to be 20 mm (Fig. 2 F). Notably, at concentrations greater than 20 mm, the ATPase activity is markedly suppressed. This probably reflects a general inhibitory effect of the high salt conditions rather than a Mg2+–specific phenomenon. The presence of NaCl (Fig. 2 G) and KCl (data not shown) actually suppresses the ATPase activity, but does not significantly change the hexameric structure of VCP (data not shown). Based on the initial characterization of the ATPase reaction, 0.5 μm VCP, 3 mm ATP, 20 mm Mg2+, and a 15-min reaction time were routinely used in the rest of the study. Recent studies have suggested an involvement of VCP/orthologs in stress tolerance pathways (15Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 16Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell.

Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). We analyzed the in vitro ATPase profile of VCP under various conditions reflecting environmental stresses (see “Discussion”). Interestingly, the activity increased significantly at elevated temperatures and peaked between 50–55 °C (Fig. 2 H), a temperature at which most enzymes would be inactivated. The observation is not unique to the low salt concentration (open circles) because experiments performed under physiological ionic strength condition also yielded similar results (filled squares). Comparison between the enzyme kinetics at 37 and 50 °C (Fig. 2 I) revealed an ∼60% increase in V max, a small decrease inK m for ATP, and an ∼35% increase in the Hill coefficient. The high sequence similarity between D1 and D2 and the sigmoid kinetic curve in VCP suggest that both D1 and D2 contribute to the ATPase activity. It has been shown in several type II AAA members that, although not in specific order, one domain is essential for forming the oligomers and the other responsible for the major enzyme activity. Since such structure-function relationship has not been demonstrated for VCP, we used the mutants to determine which domain is responsible for the major ATPase activity at physiological temperatures (Fig. 3 A and summarized in Fig. 5). As negative controls, double mutants harboring mutations in ATP-binding sites (A1A2) or ATP hydrolysis sites (B1B2) in both domains exhibit near background ATPase activity. A1, B1, and A1B1 mutants, all containing a mutated D1 and an intact D2, exhibit an activity slightly lower than the wild type. By contrast, A2, B2, A2B2, and ND1 mutants, all containing an intact D1 but a mutation in D2, have a low but detectable activity. Moreover, deletion mutant E, which contains only the D2 and no D1 domain, displays a reduced but significant ATPase activity. Together these results suggest that the second ATPase domain, D2, is responsible for the major ATPase activity, a conclusion consistent with the in vitro degradation experiments (Fig. 1 B). Another line of evidence supporting D2 as the major ATPase is provided by its sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a cysteine-sensitive alkylating agent. It has been shown that VCP orthologs as well as homologous proteins, such as NSF, SEC18, etc., possess NEM-sensitive ATPase activity (6Peters J.M. Walsh M.J. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 30Frohlich K.U. Fries H.W. Peters J.M. Mecke D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, NEM markedly reduced the activity of wild type, A1, B1, A1B1, and E variants, all of which contain an intact D2 domain. For those variants containing only the wild type D1 domain (A2, B2, A2B2, and ND1), NEM did not further lower their activities. It is known that NEM sometimes causes proteins to be denatured and therefore inhibits ATPase activity. This is not the case for VCP, because gel filtration analysis showed that wild type VCP still preserves a hexameric structure in the presence of 5 mm NEM (data not shown). To investigate the roles of D1 and D2 in heat-induced ATPase activity, we measured the activity of various mutants at 37 and 50 °C (Fig. 4 and summarized in Fig. 5). Remarkably, A1 displays a temperature dependence that peaks at ∼40 °C, whereas A2 is most active at ∼60 °C (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that D1 may play a role in mediating the heat-induced activity. To further substantiate this notion, various site-specific mutants were assayed. As evidenced in Fig. 4 B, all constructs possessing an intact D1 domain (e.g. WT, A2, B2, and A2B2) exhibit a heat-induced activity; but constructs carrying D1 mutations (e.g. A1, B1, A1A2, and B1B2) do not. To further demonstrate the contrast, A2, B2, and A2B2 were assayed up to 60 °C, at which all variants exhibit a much higher activity (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, different amounts of the deletion mutants ND1 (containing only D1) and E (containing only D2) were analyzed at 37 and 50 °C (Fig. 4 D). ND1 exhibits heat-induced activity at every dosage level, whereas E showed even slightly decreased activity at 50 °C. Combined with the aforementioned data, our results (summarized in Fig. 5) suggest that at the physiological temperature, D2 accounts for the major ATPase activity; but at elevated temperature or heat shock conditions D1 probably mediates the heat-induced activity. Our study indicates that Ub-binding activity of VCP is necessary but not sufficient for mediating the Ub-Pr degradation and that the chaperone activity, executed by the ATPase domains, is also required. To characterize the ATPase activity, we generated a variety of VCP mutants in the form of His-tagged fusion proteins. We noticed that the purity of each variant is of extreme importance in determining the ATPase activity, because even trace amount of the co-purified bacterial ATPases would introduce significant background activities (data not shown). Both conventional column chromatography and affinity chromatography with step elution were employed to purify the fusion proteins. The repeated affinity chromatography proved sufficient to yield high purity products because the quality of such purified proteins is similar to that obtained from serial combinations of conventional chromatography (data not shown). AAA family members all possess weak ATPase activities. Consistent with this notion, VCP indeed exhibits an ATPase activity ∼10-fold weaker than Na+/K+-ATPase (data not shown). The estimated K m of ∼0.33 mm for ATP andV max of ∼0.52 nmol Pimin−1 μg−1 are in agreement with aK m of 0.62 mm andV max of 0.3 nmol Pimin−1 μg−1 previously reported for the rat liver p97 (32Meyer H.H. Kondo H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity reaches the maximum at an ATP concentration of 3 mm (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the enzyme activity can be modulated by the level of ATP within a normal physiological concentration of ATP (0.5–2 mm). At a physiological temperature, VCP has a significantly higher activity than NSF (Fig. 2 C). Since both proteins were purified in the absence of ATP, which is required for hexamerization of NSF (22Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J.

https://openalex.org/W2015808639,"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a maternally inherited form of central vision loss, is associated with mitochondrial DNA pathogenic point mutations affecting different subunits of complex I. We here report that osteosarcoma-derived cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrid) cell lines harboring one of the three most frequent LHON pathogenic mutations, at positions 11778/ND4, 3460/ND1, and 14484/ND6, undergo cell death when galactose replaces glucose in the medium, contrary to control cybrids that maintain some growth capabilities. This is a well known way to produce a metabolic stress, forcing the cells to rely on the mitochondrial respiratory chain to produce ATP. We demonstrate that LHON cybrid cell death is apoptotic, showing chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA laddering. Moreover, we also document the mitochondrial involvement in the activation of the apoptotic cascade, as shown by the increased release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in LHON cybrid cells as compared with controls. Cybrids bearing the 3460/ND1 and 14484/ND6 mutations seemed more readily prone to undergo apoptosis as compared with the 11778/ND4 mutation. In conclusion, LHON cybrid cells forced by the reduced rate of glycolytic flux to utilize oxidative metabolism are sensitized to an apoptotic death through a mechanism involving mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1991883398,"Septins constitute a family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that were first discovered in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae but are also present in many other eukaryotes. In yeast they congregate at the bud neck and are required for cell division. Their function in metazoan cells is uncertain, but they have been implicated in exocytosis and cytokinesis. Septins have been purified from cells as hetero-oligomeric filaments, but their mechanism of assembly is unknown. Further studies have been limited by the difficulty in expressing functional septin proteins in bacteria. We now show that stable, soluble septin heterodimers can be produced by co-expression from bicistronic vectors in bacteria and that the co-expression of three septins results in their assembly into filaments. Pre-assembled dimers and trimers bind guanine nucleotide and show a slow GTPase activity. The assembly of a heterodimer from monomers in vitro is accompanied by GTP hydrolysis. Borg3, a downstream effector of the Cdc42 GTPase, binds specifically to a septin heterodimer composed of Sept6 and Sept7 and to the Sept2/6/7 trimer, but not to septin monomers or to other heterodimers. Septins associate through their C-terminal coiled-coil domains, and Borg3 appears to recognize the interface between these domains in Sept6 and Sept7. Septins constitute a family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that were first discovered in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae but are also present in many other eukaryotes. In yeast they congregate at the bud neck and are required for cell division. Their function in metazoan cells is uncertain, but they have been implicated in exocytosis and cytokinesis. Septins have been purified from cells as hetero-oligomeric filaments, but their mechanism of assembly is unknown. Further studies have been limited by the difficulty in expressing functional septin proteins in bacteria. We now show that stable, soluble septin heterodimers can be produced by co-expression from bicistronic vectors in bacteria and that the co-expression of three septins results in their assembly into filaments. Pre-assembled dimers and trimers bind guanine nucleotide and show a slow GTPase activity. The assembly of a heterodimer from monomers in vitro is accompanied by GTP hydrolysis. Borg3, a downstream effector of the Cdc42 GTPase, binds specifically to a septin heterodimer composed of Sept6 and Sept7 and to the Sept2/6/7 trimer, but not to septin monomers or to other heterodimers. Septins associate through their C-terminal coiled-coil domains, and Borg3 appears to recognize the interface between these domains in Sept6 and Sept7. His6+ S-peptide tag no epitope tag 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Septins form a class of eukaryotic guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that were first identified in the budding yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and congregate in a ring at the bud neck during cell division (1Longtine M.S.

Microbiol. 2001; 4: 681-689Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutations in four of the septin genes produce cell cycle arrest and cytokinesis defects when the yeast is grown at the non-permissive temperature. One essential function of septins at the bud neck may be as a diffusion barrier that helps segregate mother and daughter cell membrane components (5Takizawa P.A. DeRisi J.L. Wilhelm J.E. Vale R.D. Science. 2000; 290: 341-344Google Scholar, 6Barral Y. Mermall V. Mooseker M.S. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 841-851Google Scholar, 7Faty M. Fink M. Barral Y. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 123-131Google Scholar). The septin ring also provides a structural scaffold for the localization of many proteins to the bud neck (3Field C.M. Kellogg D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 387-394Google Scholar). Septins purified from yeast form filaments of variable length that are 7–9 nm in diameter, although the physiological significance of the filament structure remains unclear (8Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Google Scholar). The filaments show a periodicity of about 32 nm, which may represent an octamer comprising two copies of the four different septin subunits. Similar filaments have also been isolated from Drosophila and mammalian brain tissue (9Field C.M. al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Google Scholar, 10Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Roth R. Foletti D.L. Heuser J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1111-1122Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the filaments assemble from septin monomers is completely unknown. The Drosophila filaments appear to be composed of three different septins. Two of these septins, Pnut and Sep1, have been localized to the cleavage furrow in dividing cells, and Pnut has been implicated in cytokinesis, although only in certain cell types, and RNA interference of Pnut expression has an unusually low penetrance (11Fares H. Peifer M. Pringle J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1843-1859Google Scholar, 12Adam J.C. Pringle J.R. Peifer M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3123-3135Google Scholar, 13Somma M.P. Fasulo B. Cenci G. Cundari E. Gatti M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2448-2460Google Scholar). At least 10 mammalian septins have been identified to date, but most have not been studied in any detail. (Note that many have been given multiple different names, which can cause confusion in the literature and, for this reason, we will use a standard nomenclature in this report, in accordance with Human Genome Organization (HUGO) and Mouse Genomic Nomenclature (MGN) committee guidelines; see Ref. 14Macara I.G.

The murine Sept2 (previously called Nedd5) localizes to the contractile ring of dividing cells, and the injection of anti-Sept2 antibodies partially inhibits cytokinesis (15Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Google Scholar). Mammalian septins have also been implicated in exocytosis and are associated with the exocyst proteins Sec6 and Sec8 (10Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Roth R. Foletti D.L. Heuser J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1111-1122Google Scholar). Sept5 (previously called Cdcrel-1 or Pnutl) binds syntaxin and copurifies with synaptic vesicles (16Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Google Scholar). Sept5 also copurifies with syntaxin-4 in a complex from platelets, and platelets from a Sept5 knockout mouse show misregulation of secretion and aggregation (17Dent J. Kato K. Peng X.R. Martinez C. Cattaneo M. Poujol C. Nurden P. Nurden A. Trimble W.S. Ware J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3064-3069Google Scholar), although the mice appear otherwise normal (18Peng X.R. Jia Z. Zhang Y. Ware J. Trimble W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 378-387Google Scholar). In interphase cells, mammalian septins are organized into filamentous structures that often partially colocalize with actomyosin stress fibers (15Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Google Scholar). Sept2, Sept6, and Sept7 each colocalize with one another, suggesting that they are part of a complex, and these proteins also can be copurified in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry using the Borg3 protein as an affinity matrix (19Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 861-866Google Scholar). Borg3 is a small adapter protein that is part of a family of downstream effectors for the small GTPase Cdc42 (20Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Google Scholar, 21Hirsch D.S. Pirone D.M. Burbelo P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 875-883Google Scholar). A short, conserved motif within the Borgs (residues 83–110 in Borg3), called the BD3 domain, is both necessary and sufficient for binding septins, and, when expressed in cells, this domain induces a pronounced aggregation of septin filaments (19Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 861-866Google Scholar). Full-length Borg3 induces a less pronounced reorganization of septins, and this effect is inhibited by a gain-of-function mutant of Cdc42. Therefore, Borgs can function as adapters that link the Ras-like GTPase Cdc42 to the septin GTP-binding proteins. It is of interest that in budding yeast, which does not contain any Borg-like genes, Cdc42 has also been implicated in the regulation of septin organization at the bud neck (22Richman T.J. Sawyer M.M. Johnson D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16861-16870Google Scholar, 23Gladfelter A.S. Bose I. Zyla T.R. Bardes E.S. Lew D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 315-326Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Borgs bind to and regulate septins is not understood and has been frustrated by the lack of information on septin oligomerization and filament assembly. Moreover, it has not been clear whether the Borgs bind to one specific septin, to all septins, or rather to a particular supramolecular assembly of septins. To address this issue, we have developed methods for the expression of septin heterodimers and trimers in bacteria. We find that, whereas monomers are very unstable, the dimers and trimers are soluble and stable and can bind guanine nucleotides. The coiled-coil domains of the septins are required for these interactions. Interestingly, only the Sept6/Sept7 heterodimer can bind Borg3. Septin trimers can assemble into filaments of a diameter similar to that seen in native structures isolated from yeast and flies. We find that septin dimerization is associated with GTP hydrolysis but that Borg3 does not regulate this assembly step. Individual septins were cloned into the BamHI site of the Novagen pET30 vector so as to attach in-frame His6 + S-peptide tags (HS)1 to their N termini. The septin open reading frames were then excised by digestion with NcoI/NotI and subcloned into a second bacterial vector called ptacNT, which contains an ampicillin resistance marker, a ptac promoter, and no epitope tag (NT). To create a bicistronic vector, the pET30-Sept constructs were digested with XbaI/NotI, which excises the HS-septin open reading frame plus the upstream ribosome binding site. This fragment was cloned into ptacNT-Sept downstream of the first septin. Thus, the second septin in the vector is expressed from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and possesses an HS tag, whereas the first septin lacks a tag (for example, ptacNT-Sept7-HS-Sept6). To express three or four proteins simultaneously, we used a second compatible vector that contained a p15A origin of replication and chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance genes (pACYC184, from New England Biolabs). Expression cassettes for the septins were ligated into the BamHI site within the TetR gene of this vector. For example, Sept2 was first subcloned into pET30a and then amplified by PCR using primers that flank the T7 promoter and terminator sequences of pET30a and that attach BclI sites to each end of the product. BclI is cohesive withBamHI. Therefore, this PCR product was digested with BclI and subcloned into the BamHI site in the p15A vector. The resulting plasmid generates an HS-tagged Sept2 protein. A similar strategy was used to express untagged septins by subcloning from ptacNT into the p15A vector. In all cases, bacterial strain BL21(DE3) Gold was co-transformed with the p15A vector plus a second vector (ptacNT), and selected on plates containing both ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to liquid cultures to a concentration of 0.5 mm plus 2% ethanol at 18 °C. Cells were ruptured using a French press, and the septins were purified over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). DNA encoding various fragments of the septins was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the vectors described above. GST-Borg3 and GST-BD3 were expressed as described previously (19Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 861-866Google Scholar). To assemble septin heterodimers in vitro, monomers were prepared in small quantities from 100 ml of liquid culture and mixed immediately after elution from the Ni2+-agarose beads after >10-fold dilution into a binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Protein solutions (∼1.0 mg/ml) were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min immediately prior to measurements. Light scattering was performed using a DynaPro-MS/X instrument, with DYNAMICS control and analysis software (Proteins Solutions, Inc.). The purified Septin complex (Sept2-Sept6-Sept7) was diluted to 100 μg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The protein solution was applied onto glow-discharged, carbon-coated grids and incubated for 5 min. The sample was then washed with the dilution buffer and stabilized in the same buffer with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 min. After rinsing with water, the grid was stained with 1% uranyl acetate in 30% ethanol and examined in an electron microscope (Philips CM12). For rotary shadowing of the protein complex, the specimen was prepared as described above but on a native mica surface, and the sample was directly shadowed without staining. Septins were passed over a PD-10 column (Pharmacia) to exchange them into binding buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The proteins (20 μg) were incubated with [α-32P]GTP or [α-32P]GDP (3000 Ci/mmol) for the specified times, at 30 °C. Binding was assessed by filtering through nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (20Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Google Scholar). To assess guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to mixed monomers, 30 μg of each freshly prepared HS-tagged monomer was mixed in the presence of 2 μCi of either [α-32P]GTP or [γ-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in 1 ml of binding buffer and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed and washed through nitrocellulose filters at intervals. GTP hydrolysis was measured after loading 20 μg of heterotrimeric septins with [α-32P]GTP for 3 h and then passing them through a Centrisep spin column equilibrated with binding buffer to remove free nucleotides. The septins were then incubated for various times, and samples were analyzed for guanine nucleotide state by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates. EDTA (10 mm) and SDS (2%) were added to the samples to release the nucleotides. Plates were developed in 0.75 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.4, as described previously (24Tatsis N. Lannigan D.A. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34631-34638Google Scholar), and radioactive spots were detected and quantified using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. A fundamental problem in studying septins has been the absence of systems for their expression as stable, soluble proteins in bacteria. We were able to express small quantities of each of the Sept2, 6, and 7 monomers (Fig. 1 A), but the majority of the protein in each case remained in the bacterial pellet after lysis under all conditions tested, and the proteins in the soluble fraction tended to precipitate out of solution after purification. However, using a bicistronic vector, we were able to co-express pairs of septins that were soluble and could be purified over Ni2+-agarose in a ∼1:1 stoichiometry when a HS epitope tag was attached to one member of each pair (Fig. 1 B). All three pairs of Sept2, Sept6, and Sept7 could be expressed in this manner. Binding of the untagged partner did not represent nonspecific association with the Ni2+-agarose, because enterokinase treatment to cleave the HS tag resulted in the loss of both proteins from the beads (e.g. Fig. 1 C). Finally, by co-transformation of the bacteria with a bicistronic vector plus a second, compatible plasmid that expresses the third septin, we could copurify all three proteins on Ni2+-agarose beads at roughly a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. An example is shown in Fig. 1 D, where Sept2 was tagged and the Sept6 and Sept7 were untagged. When the purified septin trimer was analyzed by dynamic light scattering, two distinct peaks were observed, i.e. a major one corresponding to a hydrodynamic radius of ∼14 nm and a minor peak corresponding to a radius of ∼74 nm (Fig. 2 A). The major peak is consistent with a molecular size of about 256 kDa, assuming a spherical shape. This peak may correspond to a septin hexamer, which would have a calculated molecular size of about 280 kDa. The other peak represents very large particles (>5 MDa) and may represent aggregates or filaments. In contrast, a Sept6-Sept7 complex displayed a single peak radius of ∼4 nm corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼87 kDa, which is consistent with the two proteins forming a heterodimer. To determine whether the septin trimer preparation contains filaments, the purified proteins were visualized by electron microscopy. The proteins were negatively stained on carbon film (Fig. 2, Band D) or were metal-shadowed (Fig. 2 C). In each field, long filaments were visible. These filaments are ∼10 nm in diameter. The filament shown in Fig. 2 D is ∼850 nm in length. A larger field is shown at lower magnification in Fig. 2 B, which contains filaments with a variety of lengths. No filaments were observed when a Sept6-Sept7 dimer was examined after similar treatment. For comparison, the septin filaments from yeast are 7–9 nm in diameter (8Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Google Scholar). Those from Drosophila are also ∼7 nm in diameter, and those from mammalian brain tissue are ∼8.25 nm in diameter (9Field C.M. al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Google Scholar, 10Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Roth R. Foletti D.L. Heuser J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1111-1122Google Scholar). A significant difference between the recombinant and purified septin filaments is that the latter show a periodicity along the length of the filament with a unit length of about 25–30 nm, whereas our recombinant Sept2/6/7 filaments do not. This difference and the low percentage of trimers that assemble into filaments in bacteria together suggest that we are lacking a stabilizing component. One possibility is that this component is a fourth septin, such as MSF or E-septin (now called Sept9), which was detected, although at low stoichiometry, in our initial pull-down experiments with GST-Borg3 (19Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 861-866Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our data show that septin filaments can form spontaneously when expressed in bacteria. Moreover, septin monomers are highly unstable but can form stable heterodimers. To test the functionality of the recombinant septins, we assayed guanine nucleotide binding. Initially, septins were incubated with [α-32P]GTP or [α-32P]GDP and then bound to nitrocellulose filters. Under a variety of conditions (± MgCl2 or EDTA at 4 °C or 30 °C) we could not detect32P binding to Sept6 but found a low level of binding to Sept7 and Sept2 (not shown). Others have also reported GTP-binding to Sept2 and indicated that the nucleotide has a high off-rate (15Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Google Scholar). These data are consistent with our conclusion that the septin monomers are unstable and may be largely unfolded. The three septin heterodimers and the trimer all bound [α-32P]GTP in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 A). When diluted into a solution containing 1 mm unlabeled GTP, the 32P was slowly released with a similar half-time for all the complexes of ∼150 min at 30 °C (Fig. 3 B). Nucleotide binding to the trimer continued for at least 24 h at 30 °C, by which time the complex was labeled to a stoichiometry of about 10% (assuming that each subunit is capable of binding nucleotide). This result is consistent with guanine nucleotide binding data for purified septins from Drosophila (9Field C.M. al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Google Scholar). A competition assay using cold GTP or GDP showed that the septin dimers do not discriminate between dinucleotides and trinucleotides (data not shown). Remarkably, neither the binding nor release of guanine nucleotide was affected by the addition of excess EDTA to complex the magnesium ions. This behavior is very different from that of most other GTP-binding proteins, which require magnesium ions to stabilize the association of the nucleotide with the protein. To test for GTPase activity, we incubated the septins with [α-32P]GTP for 2 h and then passed the complex through a size exclusion column to remove unincorporated nucleotide. At intervals the septins were then denatured with SDS, and the bound nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography. Under these conditions, we observed a time-dependent fall in the level of bound [α-32P]GTP coupled to a rise in the level of bound [α-32P]GDP (Fig. 3 C). This reciprocal change strongly supports the hypothesis that the septin complex does possess a GTPase activity, although it is extremely inefficient. Finally, we wished to determine whether GTP hydrolysis might play a role in the assembly of septin heterodimers or filaments from monomers. Because the monomers are unstable, we were unable to detect efficient association into dimers when they were mixed and could not directly test the effects of slowly hydrolyzable analogs of GTP on dimerization. Therefore, to address this issue, we prepared small quantities of pure monomers and rapidly mixed them in the presence of either [α-32P]GTP or [γ-32P]GTP. We reasoned that if GTP hydrolysis occurs on dimerization, then we would not detect bound 32P when using the [γ-32P]GTP; but with [α-32P]GTP, 32P would be retained on the septin heterodimer as [α-32P]GDP. On the other hand, if GTPase activity was not involved in dimerization, both the [γ-32P]GTP and [α-32P]GTP should bind equally well. The appearance of bound 32P in the experiment would also provide an indirect measure of dimerization, because the monomers bind nucleotide very inefficiently. The results of this type of experiment are shown in Fig. 3 D. When [α-32P]GTP was added to Sept6 or Sept7 alone, only a small amount of binding to the Sept7 monomer was detected and none to Sept6. However, when the Sept6 and Sept7 were mixed at the same time as the nucleotide was added, bound counts accumulated over time, suggesting that a fraction of the monomers was combining into stable dimers that could bind nucleotide. When the same experiment was performed but in the presence of an equal amount of [γ-32P]GTP, significantly less protein-bound32P accumulated. This result suggests that GTP hydrolysis is occurring at a rate that is equal to or greater than the rate of dimer formation. Most septins consist of a variable N-terminal region followed by a GTP-binding domain and terminate in a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. To determine which regions of the septins are required for dimerization, we co-expressed either the isolated C-terminal regions or the N-terminal regions (variable domain plus GTP-binding domain) in bacteria, with an HS tag on only one of the components and asked if the untagged component co-purified on Ni2+-agarose beads. The isolated N terminus of Sept6 was mostly insoluble, and its solubility was not increased by the co-expression of Sept7 (data not shown; also see below and Fig. 5 D). However, when the C-terminal coiled-coil domains of each were expressed, the HS-tagged Sept7 co-purified with the untagged C terminus of Sept6 (Fig. 4). Note also that the stability of the Sept7 fragment appears to be increased by the presence of Sept6-(283–429). We conclude that at least two of the septins, Sept6 and Sept7, likely associate into a heterodimer through their coiled-coil domains.Figure 4Septin dimerization occurs through the C-terminal coiled-coil regions of the subunits. Fragments of Sept6 and HS-tagged Sept7 were expressed either individually or together inE. coli and purified from lysates on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Sept6-(283–429) and Sept7-(274–418) contain the putative coiled-coil domain but lack the GTP-binding domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Affinity purification of cell lysates, using GST-Borg3 attached to beads, can isolate a complex of at least three septins from cell lysates. We have shown previously that a small domain of about 28 amino acids (residues 83–110), which is conserved within the Borg family, is both necessary and sufficient to bind septins (19Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Sheffield P.J. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 861-866Google Scholar). We named this sequence the BD3 domain. To identify the minimum requirement for binding of septins to this BD3 domain, we tested three septin monomers, their various heterodimers, and the trimer for association with a GST-BD3. As shown in Fig. 5 A, none of the monomers were capable of binding to the BD3 domain. Additionally the Sept2-Sept6 heterodimer did not bind the BD3 domain. However, the Sept6-Sept7 complex and the septin trimer were efficiently captured by the BD3 domain. In a second experiment, a GST fusion of the full-length Borg3 was used, and all three heterodimers were tested using detection of the S-peptide tag on one of the septins as a more sensitive assay for bound protein (Fig. 5 B). Again, only the Sept6-Sept7 heterodimer bound to the GST-BD3 beads. This result supports the idea that individual septin polypeptides are unable to recognize the BD3 domain of Borg3 and that epitopes provided by both Sept6 and Sept7 are required. As a further test of this hypothesis, we used a yeast three-hybrid conjugation assay. Yeast (yDW-12a) was produced that expresses Sept7 and/or a fusion protein comprising Sept6 attached to the LexA-DNA binding domain (the bait). These strains were mated to yeast (W303) that expresses a fusion protein of Borg3 plus the activation domain of VP16 (the prey). If the Borg3 binds to Sept6, it induces the expression of the His3 gene and allows survival of diploid yeast on selective medium lacking histidine and containing a low concentration of an inhibitor of histidine synthesis (3-aminotriazole). As shown in Fig. 5 C, Sept6 alone did not allow growth of the diploid yeast in the selective medium. Only yeast that expressed both Sept6 and Sept7 was able to grow. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that binding of Borg3 occurs to a Sept6-Sept7 heterodimer and not to isolated monomers. To begin to identify the regions of these septins that are required for the interaction with Borg3, we used the isolated C-terminal coiled-coil region of Sept6 and full-length Sept7. Although Borg3 did not bind to either of these proteins alone, it did bind to the paired proteins (Fig. 5 D). Note that this result supports the observation (Fig. 4) that the C-terminal domain of Sept6, which lacks the GTP-binding domain, is sufficient to bind Sept7. The N-terminal region of Sept6 is mostly insoluble and was not captured in a complex with Sept7 by GST-BD3 on beads (Fig. 5 D). We conclude, therefore, that Borg3 binding to septins requires the Sept6-Sept7 heterodimer and that it does not require both GTP binding domains. We have been unable thus far to detect Borg3 binding to the dimerized coiled-coil domains of Sept6-Sept7, however, suggesting that the BD3 binding domain may extend further into the N-terminal region than do the dimerization motifs. To ascertain whether Borg3 modulates septin dimerization, we mixed recombinant Sept6 and Sept7 monomers in the presence of [α-32P]GTP with or without GST-Borg3, but no difference in nucleotide binding was observed. Similarly, when a preformed Sept6-Sept7 dimer was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP and exposed to Borg3, no change in the release of 32P from the protein was observed (data not shown). Therefore, Borg3 does not increase the GTPase activity during or after dimerization. Our understanding of septin function depends on knowledge of the biochemistry of these proteins. However, their study has been hampered by difficulties associated with their expression as recombinant proteins in bacteria and the complexity of their interactions with one another. We have developed systems to express multiple septins inE. coli and have demonstrated that three septins can together form filaments with dimensions similar to those purified from cells. Understanding their biochemistry remains a challenge, however, because the septin oligomers bind guanine nucleotides and hydrolyze GTP, only very slowly. Moreover, the instability of the monomers complicates investigations of oligomer assembly. Nonetheless, we can begin to understand the assembly process. First, we conclude that any pair of septins (at least Sept2, Sept6, and Sept7) can form heterodimers, although the Sept6/7 dimer is more stable; second, at least the Sept6/7 dimer associates through the coiled-coil regions in the C terminus of each septin rather than through their GTP-binding domains; and third, GTP hydrolysis accompanies dimer formation (although we cannot prove that hydrolysis is required for dimerization). Finally, we have found that the septin binding protein, Borg3, associates not with individual monomeric septins, but rather that it specifically recognizes the Sept6/7 heterodimer. We speculate that the BD3 domain binds at the coiled-coil interface between the subunits of the dimer. The mechanism by which Borg3 binding triggers septin reorganization in cells remains obscure, however, because we have been unable to detect any effect on dimerization or on recombinant filament bundling in vitro. One interesting possibility is that it displaces another protein, perhaps another septin such as Sept9, which normally associates with Sept6/7 in the cell via an overlapping binding site. We are currently investigating the effects of Borg3 on septin dynamics, both in vivo and in vitro. The ability to express recombinant septin filaments and heterodimers will provide powerful new tools in this endeavor, because these proteins can be tagged with fluorescent markers and injected into cells. Speckle microscopy can then be used to analyze the filament dynamics. The ability to express septin dimers and trimers will also be useful for production of affinity ligands, to aid in the identification of septin binding proteins from mammalian cell extracts, and to search for regulatory factors that may modulate GTP binding or hydrolysis. Finally, the ability to produce septin oligomers is an essential step toward the goal of obtaining high resolution x-ray crystallographic structures of the septins. While this manuscript was in review, the assembly of a Xenopus septin, Xl Sept2, was shown to be able to form filaments in a GTP-dependent manner (25Mendoza M. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1858-1863Google Scholar). We have so far been unable to detect changes in filament assembly of the heterotrimer in response to GTP or nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP."
https://openalex.org/W2035979154,"Bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15) and growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) are members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. Both molecules are closely related in their primary structures and share a nearly identical spatiotemporal expression pattern in the oocyte during folliculogenesis in mammals. Here we have established a series of cell lines, which express recombinant BMP-15, GDF-9, or both, and investigated whether they form homodimers and/or heterodimers. We demonstrate the first evidence that both BMP-15 and GDF-9 can form non-covalent homodimers when expressed individually, while when both are co-expressed BMP-15/GDF-9 heterodimers are produced. Interestingly, when GDF-9 and BMP-15 are co-expressed the processing of both proproteins are significantly impaired as compared with that of the singly expressed proproteins, suggesting that the proprotein heterodimer is less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage than the individual homodimers. Since BMP-15 mutant sheep, called Inverdale, exhibit severe defects in ovarian function we have also established stable transformants expressing the mutant BMP-15 (InvBMP-15) alone or together with GDF-9. Although InvBMP-15 was previously predicted to be unable to form homodimers, we show here that it does form non-covalent dimers; however, the processing efficiency of InvBMP-15 proprotein is significantly lower than wild-type BMP-15. Surprisingly, when GDF-9 is co-expressed, the processing and secretion of InvBMP-15 is abolished, and the processing of GDF-9 is also severely impaired, suggesting that the heterodimers of InvBMP-15/GDF-9 proproteins are not susceptible to proteolytic cleavage and thus degrade in the cells. Based on these findings we propose a novel hypothesis that a decrease in GDF-9 secretion may be involved in causing infertility in homozygous Inverdale ewes.

Like other members of the TGF-β superfamily, GDF-9 and BMP-15 are synthesized as preproproteins comprised of a signal peptide, a prodomain and a mature (fully processed bioactive)-domain (1McPherron A.C. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3444-3449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Laitinen M. Vuojolainen K. Jaatinen R. Ketola I. Aaltonen J. Lehtonen E. Heikinheimo M. Ritvos O. Mech.

Members of the TGF-β superfamily possess a proteolytic cleavage site(s) between the pro and mature domain where a specific protease binds and separates these two domains as an important component of the post-translational processing of these molecules (5Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Importantly, all of the evidence to date shows that for the proteolytic cleavage of TGF-β superfamily member proproteins to occur, the proproteins must first dimerize (6Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of most TGF-β superfamily members is the presence of seven conserved Cys residues in the mature region, the fourth of which forms the intersubunit disulfide bond responsible for the covalent linkage of the two subunits (7Vitt U. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). BMP-15 and GDF-9 are unique in that the fourth conserved Cys is substituted by a Ser, thus, it is not known whether these molecules exist as monomers or form non-covalent dimers. The crucial role of GDF-9 in follicle development and female fertility has recently been demonstrated by loss-of-function studies in mice in which it was shown that female mice lacking GDF-9 are infertile due to a block in folliculogenesis at the one-layer primary follicle stage (8Dong J. Albertini D.F. Nishimori K. Kumar T.R., Lu, N. Matzuk M. Nature. 1996; 383: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). In contrast, female mice lacking BMP-15 are subfertile and exhibit only minimal ovarian histopathological defects (9Yan C. Wang P. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Elvin J.A. Carino C. Prasad S.V. Skinner S.S. Dunbar B.S. Dube J.L. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 854-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that BMP-15 is a less critical factor for normal folliculogenesis than GDF-9 in mice. The recent discovery of naturally occurring mutations in thebmp15 gene in domestic sheep termed Fecundity X Inverdale (FecXI) and Hanna, (FecXH) has provided a new insight into understanding the physiological relevance of BMP-15 in female reproduction (10Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In FecXI ewes, a T-A transition at nucleotide 92 substitutes a Val with an Asp at residue 31 of the mature protein. In FecXH ewes, a C-T transition in nucleotide 67 of the bmp15 gene replaces a Glu by a stop codon at amino acid residue 23 of the mature domain of BMP-15, thus resulting in the synthesis, if any, of a very short peptide, which is highly unlikely to be biologically active. Both mutant ewes exhibit increased ovulation and lambing rates in the heterozygotes, whereas the homozygous mutant ewes are infertile with a phenotype that closely resembles that of GDF-9 knockout mice (10Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a distinct difference in phenotypes between mice and sheep having bmp15 gene mutations. A major difference between mice and sheep with homozygous mutations in thebmp15 gene is that in BMP-15 mutant sheep, GDF-9 is incapable of rescuing the defects in early follicular development, whereas the progression of the ovarian follicles through the component stages of folliculogenesis occurs quite normally in BMP-15 knockout mice, suggesting that, in mice, GDF-9 may be sufficient to compensate for the lack of BMP-15 in promoting folliculogenesis (8Dong J. Albertini D.F. Nishimori K. Kumar T.R., Lu, N. Matzuk M. Nature. 1996; 383: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 9Yan C. Wang P. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Elvin J.A. Carino C. Prasad S.V.

There has been speculation as to how the differences in the phenotype of the BMP-15 mutant mice and sheep can be explained. One hypothesis is that by virtue of species differences GDF-9 plays a dominant and necessary role in mouse folliculogenesis with BMP-15 providing a dispensable supporting role, whereas in sheep BMP-15 is indispensable. It has been noted that these differences may be associated with the polyversus mono-ovulatory nature of mice and sheep, respectively (11Galloway S.M. Gregan S.M. Wilson T. McNatty K.P. Juengel J.L. Ritvos O. Davis G.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 191: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, we have developed an alternative hypothesis by focusing on the difference in the point mutations in the bmp15 gene observed in sheep as compared with the deletion of the entire second exon of the bmp15 gene in knockout mice. In this hypothesis we propose that the relative roles of intact GDF-9 and BMP-15 could be similar in mice and sheep, but that the FecXIand the FecXH mutations in the BMP-15 protein may be able to affect GDF-9 biosynthesis in a dominant-negative fashion, possibly manifested through BMP-15/GDF-9 heterodimer formation, whereas the deletion of the entire second exon of thebmp15 gene in the knockout mouse has no effect on regulating GDF-9 biosynthesis; thus the differences in GDF-9 bioavailability may account for the differences in the phenotype caused by the single point mutations in BMP-15 in sheep versus the entire deletion of the second exon of the bmp15 gene in mice. In the present study, as a first step in evaluating these hypotheses, we investigate the intracellular interactions of BMP-15 (wild-type and mutant) and GDF-9 and characterize the impact of these interactions on the processing and secretion of these growth factors. Fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, and zeocin were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (anti-FLAG mAb), Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody (anti-Myc Ab) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Human GDF-9 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from ovarian RNA with a primer set encompassing the amino- and carboxyl termini of prepro-GDF-9 (GenBank™ accession no. NM_005260). A PCR product of expected size was cloned in-frame at the upstream site of the c-Myc epitope tag of the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) expression vector (Invitrogen). The GDF-9 cDNA with the Myc tag was then released by digestion withNotI and KpnI, subcloned into one of the multiple cloning sites of a dual expression vector, pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen), to form a plasmid designated as phGDF-9M. Human BMP-15 cDNA fused with a FLAG epitope tag was released from the previously constructed phBMP-15-FLAG (12Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) by digestion with SacII andPacI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and subcloned into the ScaI site of the other multiple cloning site of phGDF-9M. The resulting plasmid, designated as phBMP-15F/hGDF-9M, contains the full structure of human BMP-15 tagged with a FLAG epitope under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and human GDF-9 tagged with a c-Myc epitope under the control of the EF-1α promoter. We next performed standard PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using phBMP-15F/hGDF-9M to make a plasmid that co-expresses intact GDF-9 and mutant BMP-15 having a single amino acid substitution of the Ile at position 31 of the mature region to an Asp (I31D), which mimics the mutation found in the Inverdale ewe. This plasmid was designated as phBMP-15FI31D/hGDF-9M. To make plasmids that singly express BMP-15 or BMP-15I31D we released the GDF-9 cDNA from phBMP-15F/hGDF-9M or phBMP-15FI31D/hGDF-9M, respectively. The resulting plasmids were designated as phBMP-15F or phBMP-15FI31D, respectively. The structures of all plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (293T) were transfected with each expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells containing the expression plasmid were selected under 1 mg/ml of zeocin and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine (PSG), and 100 μg/ml zeocin. When the cells reached 90–100% confluency, the medium was replaced by DMEM/F12 containing PSG without zeocin. After 3–4 days of the serum-free culture, the conditioned media (CM) were harvested. For analysis of intracellular proteins, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) containing Protease-Arrest (Geno Technology Inc., St Louis, MO), 1 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 4% β-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates or CM in SDS sample buffer with 4% β-mercaptoethanol were then subjected to SDS/PAGE-immunoblotting using 12% polyacrylamide gels. Anti-FLAG Ab were used to detect BMP-15, and anti-Myc Ab were used to detect GDF-9. Where indicated, integrated relative densities of individual bands were digitized by multiplying the absorbance of the surface areas using the software package, NIH ImageJ 1.28. For chemical cross-linking, a non-cleavable cross-linker, bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to CM at a final concentration which ranged from 0.125 to 5 mm, and incubated for 2 h on ice followed by SDS/PAGE immunoblotting analysis. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, 10 μl) and Triton X-100 (0.1% final concentration) were added to 800 μl of CM from BMP-15, BMP-15/GDF-9, or GDF-9 cell lines. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C on a rotator, proteins bound to the agarose beads were eluted with SDS/PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS/PAGE immunoblotting analysis. For immunoprecipitation of intracellular proteins, BMP-15, BMP-15/GDF-9, or GDF-9 cells were grown to 100% confluency in 100-mm dishes followed by lysis in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, Protease-Arrest and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were diluted 10-fold in phosphate-buffered saline, and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. RNA was extracted by guanidium acid-isothiocyanate-phenol-chlorform methods using TriZOL® (Invitrogen). After the treatment of RNA with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI), cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using MgCl2 (1.5 mm), dNTP (0.2 mm), and 2.5 units of PlatinumTaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) under the following conditions: 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C (for GDF-9 and β-actin) or 60 °C (for BMP-15) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. All SDS/PAGE immunoblotting data presented here are representative examples of at least three separate experiments. Differences in the ratios of the mature/proprotein in the CM are shown as mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. Differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance (SPSS Standard Version 10.0.1, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In order to evaluate whether there are intracellular interactions between BMP-15 and GDF-9 following translation (i.e. the formation of heterodimers), we established stable transformant 293T cell lines expressing either BMP-15 or GDF-9 alone or both BMP-15 and GDF-9 simultaneously. The pBudCE4.1 expression vector was used to ensure equal copy number of BMP-15 and GDF-9 genes in the co-transfected cell line because this vector contains two separate cloning sites, each having an independent promoter. To verify the expression of BMP-15 and GDF-9 in the CM of each, the CM were subjected to SDS/PAGE immunoblotting analysis using an anti-FLAG Ab to detect BMP-15 and an anti-Myc Ab to detect GDF-9 (Fig. 1). Both cell lines that were transfected with phBMP-15F or with phBMP-15F/hGDF-9M secreted BMP-15 which was detected with the anti-FLAG Ab as three bands: the proprotein detected at ∼50 kDa and two bands of the mature protein detected at 16 and 17 kDa as previously reported (12Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the GDF-9 and the BMP-15/GDF-9 cell lines both secreted GDF-9, with the proprotein migrating at ∼70 kDa and mature GDF-9 migrating at ∼20 kDa. To determine whether BMP-15 and GDF-9 can form homodimers we subjected the CM to chemical cross-linking using BS3 followed by SDS/PAGE immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2). Cross-linking of BMP-15 revealed a homodimer of mature BMP-15 that migrated at ∼34 kDa and cross-linking of GDF-9 revealed a homodimer of mature GDF-9, which migrated at ∼40 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 6). Both BMP-15 and GDF-9 homodimers were also clearly detectable in CM from the BMP-15/GDF-9 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 8). Additionally, there were also high molecular mass complexes detectable in cross-linked samples, which migrated at 65∼180 kDa. These molecules most likely represent complexes of the mature domains bound to the prodomains, a phenomenon that is common in the TGF-β superfamily (13Israel D.I. Nove J. Kerns K.M. Moutsatsos I.K. Kaufman R.J. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Israel D.I. Nove J. Kerns K.M. Kaufman R.J. Rosen V. Cox K.A. Wozney J.M.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these cells are also capable of producing BMP-15/GDF-9 heterodimers, we used anti-FLAG Ab conjugated to agarose beads to co-immunoprecipitate GDF-9 with BMP-15 from CM of the various cell lines followed by SDS/PAGE immunoblotting using anti-Myc Ab to detect GDF-9. Following co-immunoprecipitation from the CM of BMP-15/GDF-9 cells, mature GDF-9 was clearly detectable (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), whereas no detectable GDF-9 was immunoprecipitated from the CM of GDF-9 cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). The ability of GDF-9 to specifically co-immunoprecipitate with BMP-15 provides evidence that these molecules exist as heterodimers in the CM of co-transfected cells. The presence of GDF-9 in the CM of the respective cell lines before immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG Ab agarose was verified (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that GDF-9 homodimers do not immunoprecipitate with anti-FLAG Ab agarose. We also attempted to co-immunoprecipitate GDF-9 with BMP-15 from the cell lysate of the various cell lines. In these studies we found that the GDF-9 proprotein co-immunoprecipitates with BMP-15 in the BMP-15/GDF-9 cells, but not the GDF-9 cells (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5and 6), indicating that inside the cells, the proproteins of BMP-15 and GDF-9 form heterodimers. To further verify the existence of the BMP-15/GDF-9 heterodimer in the CM, we subjected the CM from the cell lines to cross-linking with BS3 followed by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG Ab agarose and detection by anti-Myc Ab. Again, there was no detectable GDF-9 co-immunoprecipitated from the CM of BMP-15 cells and GDF-9 cells (Fig. 3 C,lanes 1 and 3). Co-immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked CM from BMP-15/GDF-9 cells; however, resulted in the detection of mature GDF-9 at ∼20 kDa together with a new band at 37 kDa, which is the predicted size of the heterodimer of mature BMP-15/GDF-9 (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). The mature GDF-9 is most likely derived from noncross-linked heterodimer of BMP-15/GDF-9 under these conditions. Collectively, these data provide clear evidence that BMP-15 and GDF-9 can heterodimerize. To characterize the impact of the Inverdale mutation on the production and secretion of BMP-15, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create recombinant human BMP-15 with an Asp at residue 31 of the mature protein (replacing the normal Ile present in wild-type human BMP-15), which mimics the mutation identified in the Inverdale ewe (10Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that all members of the TGF-β superfamily from a wide range of species (human, sheep, mouse, rat, sea urchin, worm, cattle, zebrafish, and chicken) contain only the conserved hydrophobic amino acids of either Val, Leu, or Ile at the 31st or its corresponding position of the molecules (10Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The mutant BMP-15 (BMP-15I31D) was successfully produced and secreted (Fig. 4, lane 3). Moreover, cross-linking studies revealed that, in disagreement with previous predictions (10Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), BMP-15I31D does form homodimers, similar to wild-type BMP-15 (Fig. 4, lane 4). We then investigated whether BMP-15I31D can interact with GDF-9 in a similar fashion to wild-type BMP-15. A stable transformant cell line was established for this purpose that expresses both BMP-15I31D and GDF-9 using the same techniques as described above. Unlike the BMP-15I31D cell line that effectively produced and secreted BMP-15I31D (Fig. 5 A, lane 2), when BMP-15I31D was co-transfected with GDF-9, the resulting cell lines were unable to produce and secrete detectable BMP-15I31D into the culture media (Fig. 5 A,lane 4). Indeed, we screened 52 individual BMP-15I31D/GDF-9 cell lines, none of which produced any detectable amount of BMP-15I31D. In addition to the lack of BMP-15I31D secretion from BMP-15I31D/GDF-9 cells, we also observed that the levels of mature GDF-9 secreted from the BMP-15I31D/GDF-9 cells was lower than those of the BMP-15/GDF-9 cells and the singly-transfected GDF-9 cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 8–10). Because BMP-15I31Dwas undetectable in the CM from BMP-15I31D/GDF-9 cells, we attempted to detect the mRNA transcripts of BMP-15I31Dand GDF-9 derived from the transfected genes by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. The mRNA encoding BMP-15 or GDF-9 was not detected in GDF-9 nor BMP-15I31D and BMP-15 cells, respectively (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5–7), indicating that BMP-15 and GDF-9 mRNAs possibly transcribed from their intrinsic genes (as compared with transfected genes) are under the detection level. However, either or both mRNAs were clearly detected in their corresponding transformants, and their levels were comparable among these cell lines (Fig. 5 B), demonstrating that the differences in the levels of secreted proteins were not caused by differences in the levels of mRNA expression. From the immunoblot data of the CM we also noted that there were variations in the relative levels of the proproteins secreted from the different cell lines, causing differences in the ratios of the mature/proprotein in the CM (Fig. 5 C). Specifically, the ratios of the mature/proprotein of BMP-15I31D or BMP-15 in the CM of the BMP-15I31D cells or the BMP-15/GDF-9 cells, respectively, were significantly lower than that of the BMP-15 cells (Fig. 5 C, left panel). This difference is most likely due to the decreased ability of the endopeptidases to cleave the proproteins to release the corresponding mature BMP-15. Additionally the cleavage of GDF-9 in the BMP-15/GDF-9 cells was also significantly impaired as compared with the singly transfected GDF-9 cells (Fig. 5 C, right panel). When GDF-9 was co-transfected with BMP-15I31D the cleavage of GDF-9 was severely impaired, to levels which were ∼90% lower than GDF-9 cells. Since it appeared that the I31D mutation in BMP-15 affects the cleavage of the BMP-15I31D as well as GDF-9 proproteins, we further investigated whether the component proproteins and mature proteins were also altered in the lysates of respective cell lines (Fig. 6). BMP-15 proproteins and mature proteins were clearly detectable in the lysates from the BMP-15 cells, BMP-15I31D cells and the BMP-15/GDF-9 cells. In contrast, mature BMP-15I31D was not detectable in the BMP-15I31D/GDF-9 cells yet the proprotein was clearly detected (Fig. 6, lane 4). Additionally, the cleavage of GDF-9 is nearly abolished in the BMP-15I31D/GDF-9 cells (Fig. 6, lane 9), suggesting that the inhibition of the cleavage of the GDF-9 proprotein may be the mechanism that accounts for the low levels of mature GDF-9 secreted by the BMP-15I31D/GDF-9 cells. BMP-15 and GDF-9 form a unique subset of the TGF-β superfamily defined by their high amino acid homology, oocyte-specific expression pattern and the fact that they both lack the fourth Cys residue of the seven Cys residues that are typically conserved in almost all members of the TGF-β superfamily (1McPherron A.C.

Because the forth Cys is responsible for intersubunit disulfide bond formation, there has been an argument as to whether BMP-15 and GDF-9 exist as monomers or homodimers. It has been predicted that GDF-9 is a monomer based on its molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (15Hayashi M. McGee E.A. Min G. Klein C. Rose U.M. Van Duin M. Hsueh A.J.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since non-covalently linked dimers migrate as monomers in SDS-PAGE, even under non-reducing conditions, the stoichiometry of GDF-9 still remained unproven. In the present study, we demonstrate that both BMP-15 and GDF-9 do indeed form non-covalent homodimers. Furthermore, because of the high similarity in the structure of BMP-15 and GDF-9 as well as their nearly-identical spatiotemporal expression patterns in the oocyte, it has been speculated that BMP-15 and GDF-9 may form heterodimers (9Yan C. Wang P. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Elvin J.A. Carino C. Prasad S.V. Skinner S.S. Dunbar B.S. Dube J.L. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol.

The functional significance of the BMP-15/GDF-9 heterodimers remains to be elucidated, however, this finding reminds us of our previous discovery of activin-A (16Ling N. Ying S.Y. Ueno N.

We demonstrate that the down-regulation of hDAB2IPmRNA in prostate cancer (PCa) cells is regulated by transcriptional levels.

In this study, we delineated the potential impact of the epigenetic control of the hDAB2IP promoter on its gene regulation in PCa. Acetylhistone H3 was associated with the hDAB2IPpromoter, and CpG islands remained almost unmethylated in normal prostatic epithelia, but not in PCa cell lines. Our data further indicated that trichostatin A (histone deacetylase inhibitor) and 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DNA hypomethylation agent) acted cooperatively in modulating hDAB2IP gene expression in PCa, whereas histone acetylation played a more significant role in this event. Moreover, a core promoter sequence from the hDAB2IP gene responsible for these treatments was identified.

In the prostate gland, this complex is detected in the basal cell population (2Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnel J.D. Navone N. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol.

In contrast, loss of expression of DOC-2/DAB2 and hDAB2IP proteins is often detected in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa)1 cell lines, and increased expression of these proteins can suppress the growth of PCa (2Wang Z.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that normal prostatic epithelial cells have elevated hDAB2IP mRNA levels compared with PCa cells, which correlate with increased hDAB2IP promoter activity (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.-T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Google Scholar). These data indicate that transcriptional regulation ofhDAB2IP is responsible for the down-regulation ofhDAB2IP expression in PCa cells. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms for the regulation ofhDAB2IP gene expression in prostatic epithelial cells. One of the hallmarks of the regulation of gene transcription is local chromatin decondensation mediated by histone acetylation, which leads to a reduced association between chromosomal DNA and histones and subsequently increases the accession of high molecular mass protein complexes of the transcription machinery. Conversely, histone deacetylation can repress transcription by increasing histone-DNA interaction (8Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 415-428Google Scholar, 9Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1998; 92: 307-313Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found that thehDAB2IP promoter does not have a typical TATA box, but contains many GC-rich sequences (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.-T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Google Scholar, 2Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnel J.D. Navone N. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12622-12631Google Scholar). DNA hypermethylation, particularly in the GC-rich promoter region, results in transcription repression that is often associated with a number of tumor suppressor gene promoters, including Rb, p15, and p16 (10Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Google Scholar, 11Magdinier F. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4990-4995Google Scholar). In this study, we delineated the roles of histone acetylation and DNA methylation in the regulation of the hDAB2IP gene in normal prostatic epithelia and PCa cells. The data presented in this work provide strong evidence for underlying mechanisms of the down-regulation of thehDAB2IP gene mediated by epigenetic control in PCa cells. Two human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3) were maintained in T medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum as previously described (2Wang Z. Tseng C.P. Pong R.C. Chen H. McConnel J.D. Navone N. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12622-12631Google Scholar). Two normal human prostate cell lines (PrEC, a primary prostatic epithelial cell line derived from a 17-year-old juvenile prostate; and PZ-HPV-7, an immortalized cell line derived from the peripheral zone of a normal prostate) were maintained in a chemically defined medium (PrEGM) purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Cells were seeded at low density (6 × 105/100-mm dish) 16 h prior to treatment with different agents at the indicated final concentrations: 25, 100, or 200 nmtrichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) or 1, 5, or 10 μm5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5′-Aza; Sigma). For TSA treatment, medium containing fresh agent was changed every 24 h for 48 h. For 5′-Aza treatment, medium containing fresh agent was changed every 48 h for 96 h. For combined treatment, TSA was added at 24 h and changed at 72 h, and 5′-Aza was replaced at 48 h. Cells were collected at 96 h after treatment. Total cellular RNA was isolated from PC-3, LNCaP, and PZ-HPV-7 cells using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total cellular RNA were used in each reaction. cDNA was synthesized and amplified using either the hDAB2IP primer set (2 ng/μl) (F-hDAB2IP, 5′-TGGACGATGTGCTCTATGCC-3′; and R-hDAB2IP, 5′-GGATGGTGATGGTTTGGTAG-3′) or the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primer set (6 ng/μl) (G3P7, 5′-GAAGGTGGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′; and G3P4, 5′-AGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′) in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μl of platinum qPCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen) and 4 μl of SYBR Green I (final dilution of 1:10,000). The reactions were carried out on a 96-well plate, and a PCR amplification protocol was followed (95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) using an iCycler iQ machine (Bio-Rad). A quality control was carried out using both electrophoresis analysis on a 2% NuSieve agarose gel (3:1; FMC Corp. BioProducts) and melting curve analysis performed immediately after the end of amplification at 95 °C for 1 min and 55 °C for 1 min and 80 cycles of 0.5 °C increments beginning at 55 °C. We also performed the standard curves for hDAB2IP and GAPDH to ensure the linearity and efficiency of both genes. The linear range of both genes is from 2 × 102 to 2 × 109 copies, and the efficiency of each reaction ranges from 92 to 97%. The relative induction of hDAB2IP mRNA was calculated as follows: ΔC t (threshold cycle) of each sample = mean ofC t(hDAB2IP) − mean of C t(GAPDH). The -fold induction of each sample = 1/2ΔC t(sample)−ΔC t(control). To analyze the promoter region of hDAB2IP, a 7.6-kb fragment from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone 298A17 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AL365274) containing the predicted first exon and additional 5′-upstream sequence of theDAB2IP gene was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene) (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.-T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Google Scholar). pGL3–1.6S, a 1.6-kbKpnI-XhoI fragment, was subcloned from this 7.6-kb element into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Two putative promoter regions (P1, a 0.8-kb SfiI-XhoI fragment from +229 to +981; and P2, a 0.6-kbKpnI-Kpn2I fragment from −598 to +44) were subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (see Fig. 1 A). To further analyze the regulation of hDAB2IP promoters, two sets of primers (F-PI (inner, 5′-CCTGCTTTCTGTTTCCTTCTCCTG-3′) and R-PI (inner, 5′-TTGAACCACCTCCTCCTCCCTCTC-3′); F-PII (inner, 5′-ATTCCTCCAGGTGGGTGTGG-3′) and R-PII (inner, 5′-CCTAAGCCGCTGTTGCCTTG-3′)) were used to amplify the PI (+768 to +873) and PII (−520 to −287) fragments. PCR fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), sequenced, and then subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector using HindIII-XhoI sites. We plated cells at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/well on a six-well plate. After 16 h, we transfected the PZ-HPV-7 and PC-3 cell lines with both 0.8 μg of reporter vectors and 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase vector (pCH110) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The LNCaP and PrEC cells were transfected with the same amount of DNA with LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after incubation, the transfected cells were treated with TSA for 24 h, 5′-Aza for 48 h, or a combination of both drugs by incubating with 5′-Aza for 24 h and then adding TSA for an additional 24 h. After washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were harvested with lysis buffer (Promega). Both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as previously described (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.-T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Google Scholar, 12Tseng C.P. Ely B.B. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each extract was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The relative luciferase activity (RLA) was calculated by normalizing both β-galactosidase and protein concentrations in each sample, and the data were averaged from RLA in triplicate. Cells were scraped, centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min, and then suspended in 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were spun down; pellets were suspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); and sulfuric acid was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cell supernatant containing the acid-soluble fraction was retained. The supernatant was dialyzed twice against 200 ml of 0.1m acetic acid for 1–2 h and then dialyzed overnight against 200 ml of H2O using Spectrapor®molecular porous membrane tubing (Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Los Angeles, CA). The protein concentration was measured, and proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15%). Western blotting was carried out with an anti-acetylhistone H3 antibody (1:3000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-histone H3 antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After treatment, formaldehyde was added to the cell medium at a final concentration of 1% for cross-linking proteins to DNA. Cells were washed, scraped off with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. An equal protein concentration of cell lysate from each sample was sonicated to reduce DNA fragments between 200 and 1000 bp. Once the cell debris was removed, the supernatant was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (1:10), and 1% of this supernatant (as input DNA) was collected, purified, and subjected to genomic PCR with the primer sets described in Table I. Samples were precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with or without (as a negative control) antibody. Immune complexes were collected by adding salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry and incubated with 20 μl of 5 m NaCl at 65 °C to reverse DNA-protein cross-linking. DNA was then purified by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation.Table IPCR primers used on bisulfite-treated DNA and in ChIP assaysPCR targetPrimer namePrimer 5′–3′ sequenceTarget sizeGenomic positionsbpBisulfite-treated DNAF-PmIIaGGATTTTTTTAGGTGGGTGT236−522 /−503R-PmIIaCCCTAAACCRCTATTACCTTAAC236−285 /−308F-PmIIbGTTAAGGTAATAGYGGTTTAGGG397−308 /−285R-PmIIbACRAACTCACCTCTCATTATCC397+89 /+68F-PmIGGTGAGTAGAAGAGAGGAGAGTA694+282 /+304R-PmICCTAAACCCTAAAAAACTATATCC694+975 /+952Immunoprecipitated DNA (ChIP)F-PII (outer)CGCTCTGGGAAGGAAAGTCG419−704 /−685F-PII (inner)ATTCCTCCAGGTGGGTGTGG233−520 /−501R-PII (inner)CTAAGCCGCTGTTGCCTTGGC233−287 /−308R-PII (outer)CCTAAGCCGCTGTTGCCTTG419−286 /−306F-PI (outer)GGGGAAGGGTGAACATCTGG486+539 /+558F-PI (inner)CCTGCTTTCTGTTTCCTTCTCCTG105+768 /+791R-PI (inner)TTGAACCACCTCCTCCTCCCTCTC105+873 /+850R-PI (outer)GCCTGTGCCTAAGTGGAAAGG486+1025 /+1005R = A or G; Y = C or T.

PCR amplifications were performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of DNA by the addition of 2 units of ThermalAceTM DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). A hot start was performed (98 °C for 3 min), followed by 30 cycles at 98 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The PCR product from the PI region (∼110 bp) was separated on 4% E-GelTM (Invitrogen), and that from the PII region (∼230 bp) was separated on a 2% NuSieve agarose gel (3:1). High molecular mass genomic DNA was obtained from PrEC, PZ-HPV-7, LNCaP, and PC-3 cell lines and subjected to bisulfite modification (13Herman J.D. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Google Scholar, 14Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 μg (5–10 μl) of genomic DNA were denatured with NaOH (final concentration of 0.2 m), 30 μl of 10 mm hydroquinone (Sigma), and 520 μl of 3 m sodium bisulfite (Sigma) at pH 5 for 16 h at 50 °C. The modified samples were purified using Wizard DNA Clean-Up system desalting columns (Promega), followed by ethanol precipitation. Bisulfite-modified DNA (100 ng) was amplified by PCR in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing the primers indicated in Table I. A hot start was performed (95 °C for 5 min) by adding 0.5 unit of HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The PCR products were cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1-TOPO. Four to eight individual clones were sequenced using reverse and forward M13 primers. Two putative promoters, P1 (+229 to +981, located within the first intron) and P2 (−598 to +44, located 5′-upstream of exon Ia) (Fig. 1 A), were identified using both the TSSW program (human PII recognition using the TRANSFAC Database) 2Available at genomic.sanger.ac.uk/gf/gf.htm. and experimental deletion analysis (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.-T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Google Scholar) of a 1662-bphDAB2IP locus surrounding the transcription initiation site (+1). As shown in Fig. 1 B, there are many GC-rich sequences, and potential transcription factor-binding sites were detected within this region using MacVector Version 6.5.3. To analyze the basal activity of each hDAB2IP promoter in various prostate cells, luciferase reporter vector constructs were generated. Using pGL3–1.6S, we detected the highest luciferase activity in both PrEC and PZ-HPV-7 cells, an intermediate level in LNCaP cells, and the lowest level in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1 C), correlating with the steady-state levels of hDAB2IP mRNA in each cell line (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.-T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Google Scholar). Similar patterns of reporter gene activity were detected in these four cell lines using either the P1 or P2 promoter (Fig. 1 C). Apparently, the decreased hDAB2IP mRNA levels detected in many human PCa cells (1Chen H. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Hsieh J.-T. Genomics. 2002; 79: 573-581Google Scholar) could be caused by its reduced gene promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). To understand the mechanism leading to the down-regulation of the hDAB2IP gene in human PCa cells, we first examined the role of epigenetic regulation of the hDAB2IP gene. The data from a ChIP assay demonstrated that the presence of acetylhistone H3 was associated with the PI and PII regions of hDAB2IP in both PrEC and PZ-HPV-7 cells, but not in PC-3 and LNCaP cells (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that histone acetylation may play a role in modulating hDAB2IPgene expression. Recent data also indicate that epigenetic controls such as histone acetylation and/or DNA methylation play cooperative roles in modulating gene expression, particularly genes involved in tumor suppression (15Stimson K.M. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4951-4958Google Scholar, 16Torres L. Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Latasa M.U. Caballeria J. Lopez-Rodas G. Boukaba A., Lu, S.C. Franco L. Mato J.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 95-102Google Scholar). We therefore treated these cells with TSA, 5′-Aza, or a combination of both. The levels of hDAB2IPmRNA expression were evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR using GAPDH as an internal control. As shown in TableII, TSA and/or 5′-Aza failed to elicit any elevation of hDAB2IP mRNA because the basal activity of the hDAB2IP promoter was very high in PZ-HPV-7 cells (Fig. 1 C). However, in PC-3 cells (Table II), either TSA or 5′-Aza was able to induce hDAB2IP mRNA expression. In contrast, the increased hDAB2IP mRNA levels in LNCaP cells treated with a single agent were lower than those in PC-3 cells (Table II) because LNCaP cells had higher endogenous hDAB2IPmRNA levels compared with PC-3 cells (1Chen H.

For the combination of both agents, the level of induction exhibited an additive effect only in the PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines. In some cases, we noticed that the mRNA levels after the combination treatment were lower than those after the single-agent treatment, which was caused by the toxicity of the drug combination.Table IIDetermination of hDAB2IP mRNA expression induced by TSA and 5′-Aza by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCRCombinationCell linePZ-HPV-7PC-3LNCaP-foldTSA (nm)/5′-Aza (μm) 0/01.001.001.00 25/00.834.021.88 100/00.805.052.42 200/00.838.312.44 0/10.833.823.58 0/50.924.034.47 0/101.084.20ND 25/11.078.025.63 100/50.979.296.83 200/10ND5.34NDEach data point was averaged from two different experiments performed in duplicate using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR.

The fold induction was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the control (taken as 1) of each cell line. ND, not determined. To delineate which promoter could be induced by TSA, 5′-Aza, or a combination of both drugs and the underlying mechanism of the induction, we transiently transfected PCa cells with pGL3-P1 or pGL3-P2 under the same treatment conditions. In PC-3 cells, TSA could induce P1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner; however, 5′-Aza only slightly induced this promoter activity (Fig. 2 A). The combination treatment exhibited an additive effect only on P1 activity. In contrast, a very different induction pattern was observed in LNCaP cells transfected with pGL3-P1; only marginal induction of P1 activity was observed in these cells after the different treatments (Fig. 2 B). By transfecting pGL3-P2 into PC-3 cells, a dose-dependent induction pattern of P2 activity was observed in these cells treated with either TSA or 5′-Aza (Fig. 2 C). In LNCaP cells, P2 activity could also be induced by either TSA or 5′-Aza in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 D), which differed from P1 activity induced by these drugs (Fig. 2 B). Again, in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, the combined treatment with TSA and 5′-Aza exhibited an additive effect only on P2 activity. In addition, we determined both P1 and P2 activities in PC-3 and LNCaP cells with a different transfection protocol; the overall induction pattern was consistent (see Fig. 1 in the Supplemental Material). Taken together, these results indicate that the P2 promoter is responsible for both TSA- and 5′-Aza-induced hDAB2IP gene expression in PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines. To evaluate the possibility of a global gene induction effect of TSA or 5′-Aza on PCa cells, we examined the activity of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene promoter in LNCaP and PC-3 cells treated with either agent. As shown in Fig. 2 E, no induction of PSA reporter activity was detected in both cell lines treated with a single agent or a combination of both agents. In contrast, androgen could induce PSA reporter activity dramatically in LNCaP cells (androgen receptor-positive), but not in PC-3 cells (androgen receptor-negative). Therefore, we believe that TSA or 5′-Aza has a specific effect on regulating hDAB2IP gene expression in PCa cell lines. To determine whether the TSA-inducedhDAB2IP gene expression correlated with the levels of histone acetylation associated with the hDAB2IP promoter region, we analyzed the steady-state levels of acetylhistone H3 in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells after TSA treatment. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Western blot analysis of PC-3 cells indicated that the basal level of acetylhistone H3 was very low, whereas TSA induced a dramatic elevation of the ratio between acetylhistone H3 and total histone H3. Comparing this with the no-treatment control, TSA induced a dose-dependent (ranging from 8- to 88-fold) elevation of acetylhistone H3. In contrast, the basal level of acetylhistone H3 was very high in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, we failed to detect any changes in the steady-state levels of acetylhistone H3 in LNCaP cells treated with TSA. Nevertheless, it is still possible that TSA increases the acetylhistone H3 levels associated with the hDAB2IP promoter region. To analyze the status of acetylhistone associated with thehDAB2IP promoter, a ChIP assay was performed using the sequences corresponding to the PI (+768 to +873) and PII (−520 to −287) regions (Fig. 1 A). Elevated levels of acetylhistone H3 were clearly associated with the PI region in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells treated with TSA or the combination, but not with 5′-Aza (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, an accumulation of acetylhistone H3 levels associated with the PII region was also detected in both cell lines treated with TSA or the combination (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, we also found that 5′-Aza treatment could induce the accumulation of acetylhistone H3 in the PII region, but not in the PI region (Fig. 4 B), because P2 (but not P1) activity could be induced in both PCa cell lines treated with 5′-Aza (Fig. 2). A similar phenomenon has also been observed in several different genes treated with 5′-Aza (10Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Google Scholar, 17Nakayama T. Watanabe M. Yamanaka M. Hirokawa Y. Suzuki H. Ito H. Yatani R. Shiraishi T. Lab. Invest. 2001; 7: 1049-1056Google Scholar). Also, some data suggest that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can act cooperatively to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells (18Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Stroubous J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Google Scholar, 20Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Google Scholar). Although the ChIP assay provides a unique analysis of the specific chromatin DNA region that associates with acetylhistone proteins, the results need to be confirmed by function assays such as a reporter gene assay. Therefore, we investigated the luciferase activity of two constructs, pGL3-PI (+768 to +873) and pGL3-PII (−520 to −287), in PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines after treatment. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), the basal luciferase activity of the pGL3-PI construct was much higher than that of the pGL3-P1 construct in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells (Fig. 2,A and B), suggesting that the deletion of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences from the P1 region may contain some negative elements. Overall, we detected a slight increase in PI activity only in PC-3 cells treated with TSA or a combination of both TSA and 5′-Aza (Fig. 5 A); however, no change in PI activity was detected in LNCaP cells after treatment (Fig. 5 B). We observed a dramatic induction of PII activity in PC-3 cells after treatment (10–18-fold increase with TSA and 14–30-fold increase with the combination) (Fig. 5 C). Using 5′-Aza, an ∼3-fold induction of PII activity was detected in PC-3 cells. A similar induction profile of PII activity was detected in LNCaP cells (Fig. 5 D). For example, TSA alone induced an ∼6–14-fold increase in PII activity, whereas the combination treatment induced an 8–44-fold increase in reporter gene activity. An ∼2-fold induction of PII activity was observed in LNCaP cells treated with 5 μm 5′-Aza. In addition, we repeated these experiments with a different transfection protocol; the overall induction pattern was consistent (see Fig. 2 in the Supplemental Material). Taken together, these data suggest that PII (−520 to −287) within thehDAB2IP promoter is the core regulatory region for modulating hDAB2IP gene transcription. It is known that aberrant methylation (which is associated with gene silencing) in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes is commonly detected in cancer cells (18Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A.

CpG islands appear to be critical sites modulated by DNA methylation (21Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Google Scholar, 22Jones P.A. Takai D.

Because the 5′-regulatory region in the hDAB2IPpromoter is GC-rich and the DNA hypomethylation agent (5′-Aza) can induce hDAB2IP gene expression, determining the methylation profile of the promoter region in normal and cancerous cells could provide additional evidence for the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of hDAB2IP during PCa development. In this experiment, two PCa cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) and two normal prostate cell lines (PrEC and PZ-HPV-7) were subjected to bisulfite genomic sequencing. With respect to the high GC content in thehDAB2IP promoter, primers were designed to avoid potential methylation sites (e.g. CpG) such that both met"
https://openalex.org/W2008184881,"Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) are GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs), which can inhibit heterotrimeric G protein pathways. In this study, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence that high concentrations of receptors (as at a synapse) can lead to saturation of GDP-GTP exchange making GTP hydrolysis rate-limiting. This results in local depletion of inactive heterotrimeric G-GDP, which is reversed by RGS GAP activity. Thus, RGS enhances receptor-mediated G protein activation even as it deactivates the G protein. Evidence supporting this model includes a GTP-dependent enhancement of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding to Gi by RGS. The RGS domain of RGS4 is sufficient for this, not requiring the NH2- or COOH-terminal extensions. Furthermore, a kinetic model including only the GAP activity of RGS replicates the GTP-dependent enhancement of GTPγS binding observed experimentally. Finally in a Monte Carlo model, this mechanism results in a dramatic “spatial focusing” of active G protein. Near the receptor, G protein activity is maintained even with RGS due to the ability of RGS to reduce depletion of local Gα-GDP levels permitting rapid recoupling to receptor and maintained G protein activation near the receptor. In contrast, distant signals are suppressed by the RGS, since Gα-GDP is not depleted there. Thus, a novel RGS-mediated “kinetic scaffolding” mechanism is proposed which narrows the spatial range of active G protein around a cluster of receptors limiting the spill-over of G protein signals to more distant effector molecules, thus enhancing the specificity of Gi protein signals.

There is much recent evidence for the formation of complexes maintained by protein scaffolds to control signaling specificity. This contrasts with a classical model in the G protein signaling field, the collision-coupling model (1Tolkovsky A.M. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3795-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which relies entirely on the structure of receptor-G protein and G protein-effector contact sites to determine signaling specificity. The collision coupling model also suggests that there would be significant spread of G protein signals in a cell upon receptor activation, since all components are freely diffusable. There have been numerous studies indicating that such free transfer of information over long distances may not occur for Gi or Gq mediated signals (2Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar,3Rodbell M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to the localized signaling by postsynaptic ionotropic receptors via protein complex assembly (4Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), mechanisms to limit the “spread” of G protein signaling appear necessary. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 activate cellular signals by inducing nucleotide exchange on the G protein α subunit, while inactivation occurs upon GTP hydrolysis by the intrinsic Gα GTPase (5Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4715) Google Scholar). Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a recently discovered family of proteins which act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Gα subunits (6Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 7Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 8Koelle M.R.

Drug Discovery. 2002; 1: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The GAP activity of RGS proteins generally reduces steady state levels of GTP-bound Gα subunits and inhibits the activity of G proteins (6Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 10De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). However, some studies of receptor-stimulated signaling show that RGS proteins can speed the kinetics of responses without compromising steady state signaling strength (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism and significance of this paradoxical result is not understood. The maintained signaling in the face of RGS-enhanced GTPase activity suggests that the RGS proteins somehow increase the efficiency of G protein activation. One possible mechanism for this could be “physical scaffolding” in which the RGS protein binds to both receptor and G protein and stabilizes a complex between them. This could involve the diverse amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of the RGS proteins such as GGL, DEP, DH/PH, and PDZ domains (6Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 10De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Indeed, RGS12 does bind to the carboxyl terminus of the IL8 receptor through a PDZ domain (16Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G.

Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have suggested that the GAP activity of phospholipase C-β1, which is both a Gq GAP and its effector, serves to enhance muscarinic receptor-Gq coupling (6Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 17Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In that model, the GAP activity causes rapid hydrolysis of GTP so that the Gα-GTP does not have time to completely dissociate from receptor, which is then able to rapidly catalyze the next round of GDP/GTP exchange. In this report, we propose that RGS proteins, via their ability to accelerate GTP hydrolysis, reduce depletion of local Gα-GDP levels to permit rapid recoupling to receptor and maintained G protein activation near the receptor with decreased activity farther away. This narrows the spatial range of active G protein around a cluster of receptors by a “kinetic scaffolding” rather than by a physical scaffolding mechanism. While local signaling to a nearby effector is not significantly reduced in the presence of RGS, both the kinetics and spatial focus of signaling are sharpened, thus limiting the spill-over of G protein signals to more distant effector molecules.

Simulations were run on a 600 × 600 × 600 triangular lattice (2.5 nm per grid step) with three distinct diffusible species: receptors, inactive G proteins, and active G proteins. Receptors and G proteins had a diameter of two lattice spacings and could interact with adjacent particles separated by one or fewer lattice spacings. In each time step, receptors could activate one adjacent inactive G protein if available, otherwise the receptor caused no reactions. Active G proteins were allowed to revert to inactive G proteins with a probability proportional to the GTP hydrolysis rate,k hyd. Inactive G proteins were passive. All species in the simulation were assumed to have the same diffusion rate. The simulation was started with 600 inactive G proteins and 1 receptor and allowed to equilibrate for 5 million iterations. Over the next 5 million iterations, data sets were gathered to determine the radial distribution from the receptor of inactive and active G proteins. Diffusion coefficients were 10−10, 10−9, and 10−8 cm2/s, and k hydvalues were 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, and 200 s−1. Data were analyzed with non-linear curve fitting equations using GraphPad Prism 3 (San Diego, CA). Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were conducted using one-way ANOVA. To study RGS function in the presence of receptor we examined CHO cell membranes expressing high levels (10 pmol/mg) of α2a adrenergic receptor (α2aAR). Since RGS does not affect steady state GTPase activity ofpurified G proteins because GDP release is rate-limiting, any effect on GTPase in these membranes should be attributable to receptor-stimulated G protein. Surprisingly, the α2aAR membranes without added RGS showed only a modest agonist-induced increase in GTPase activity (from 2.3 to 3.3 pmol/mg/min) but RGS4 further increased the α2aAR-stimulated GTPase activity 3.8 ± 0.1-fold (Fig. 1 A) with an EC50 for RGS4 of 0.46 ± 0.06 μm(n = 3). As expected, the basal (or non-agonist stimulated) GTPase activity was only marginally increased by RGS4 (1.2-fold). Also, membranes expressing lower amounts of receptor gave proportionally smaller increases in GTPase activity (data not shown). Thus the RGS-mediated enhancement of GTPase is receptor-dependent and requires that the rate of receptor-stimulated GDP release exceed that of the unstimulated GTP hydrolysis, making hydrolysis rate-limiting in the G protein cycle. This raises the interesting possibility that at these receptor densities, the rate of receptor activation of G protein may become limited by depletion of the G-GDP receptor substrate in the absence of RGS activity. The RGS specificity of the GTPase stimulation was RGS4 > RGS8 ≫ RGS7 = RGS2 (Fig. 1 B). This is expected, since Gαi2 and Gαi3 subunits are activated by the α2aAR in CHO cells (24Gerhardt M.A. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 707-711PubMed Google Scholar). RGS4 and RGS8 are good GAPs for Gαi2 and Gαi3, while RGS2 and RGS7 are specific for Gq and Go (19Lan K.L. Zhong H.L. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), respectively, which are either not activated by α2aAR (Gαq) or not expressed in CHO (Gαo). This ability of RGS4 and RGS8 to increase steady state GTPase of receptor-stimulated G proteins is similar to recent data from Milligan and co-workers (25Cavalli A. Druey K.M. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23693-23699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using receptor-Gα fusion proteins. With our receptor/G protein/RGS system established we wanted to test possible mechanisms leading to the unexplained effect of RGS proteins to increase on- and off-rates of channel kinetics without significantly decreasing the steady state signal amplitude (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,12Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). If RGS could enhance G protein activation as well as deactivation, that might account for those results. Therefore, we tested the ability of RGS4 3All RGS proteins were prepared and used as GST fusion proteins unless indicated otherwise. to enhance receptor-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding. As expected, the full α2aAR agonist UK 14,304 stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding (4.1 ± 0.3-fold) (Fig.2 A), indicating efficient receptor-G protein coupling in the absence of RGS. Consistent with the possibility that RGS could enhance activation, RGS4 caused a small (∼50%) increase in UK 14,304-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding with an EC50 of 0.4 μm (Fig.2 A). In attempting to optimize the magnitude of the RGS-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding we tested the ability of GDP and GTP to enhance the effect of RGS4. Unlike receptor-stimulated GTPγS binding for which the -fold increase is enhanced by GDP, the RGS effect was strongly increased only upon addition of GTP (Fig. 2, B and C,insets). The small increase (∼30%) in GTPγS binding in the absence of added nucleotide probably results from endogenous GTP present in the membrane preparations. Furthermore, the micromolar GTP concentrations used in the subsequent studies are appropriate, since cellular GTP levels are in the high micromolar range. With added GTP present, RGS4 stimulated GTPγS binding 3.0 ± 0.1-fold with an EC50 of 1.0 μm (Fig.3 A). There was also a small increase in [35S]GTPγS binding in the absence of UK 14,304 (EC50 of 1.3 μm and a maximum effect of 2.3-fold), possibly due to constitutive receptor activity or GTP-bound Gα subunits. To ensure that the effect of RGS4 was specific, we also tested the protein buffer (phosphate-buffered saline), boiled RGS4, and GST alone (Fig. 3 B), which had no effect. Also, thrombin-cleaved purified RGS4 protein 4The thrombin-cleaved RGS4 construct has an amino-terminal extension of GSPGIRL and was >90% pure by Coomassie staining on SDS-PAGE. gave effects similar to GST-RGS4 (data not shown). We examined the specificity of the different RGS proteins and found that it was identical to that for GTPase stimulation (compare Figs. 1 B and3 B). One mechanism by which RGS could stimulate GTPγS binding is by enhancing receptor-G protein coupling. The simplest scheme would be for RGS to bind directly to both proteins (R and G) forming a physical scaffold perhaps enhancing receptor-G protein pre-coupling (26Neubig R.R. Gantzos R.D. Thomsen W.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2374-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27.Sklar, L. A., Eberle, M., Fay, S. P., Norgauer, J., Mueller, H., Freer, R. J., Muthukumaraswamy, N., and Magde, D. (1991) inSignaling Mechanisms in Secretory and Immune Cells(Martinez, J. R., Edwards, B. S., and Seagrave, J. C., eds) pp. 19–24.Google Scholar). Indeed, the amino-terminal amphipathic sequence of RGS4 confers receptor specificity in regulation of Gq signaling, and it has been suggested that it may directly interact with receptors (28Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus that region would be a logical candidate to engage in the formation of a receptor/RGS/Gi protein complex. To determine whether the amino-terminal sequence of RGS4 was necessary or sufficient for enhancing receptor-stimulated GTPγS binding to Gi, we prepared the catalytic domain fragment of RGS4 (RGS4box, aa 58–177, His6-tagged) and an amino-terminal synthetic peptide (1–51), which has previously been shown to enhance RGS regulation of Gq in cells (28Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain alone (i.e. RGSbox) stimulated GTPγS binding to Giin a manner identical to that of full-length RGS4 (Fig. 3, Cand D). In addition, the amino-terminal fragment alone had no effect (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore the peptide did not potentiate or inhibit the effects of the RGSbox construct (data not shown). These results rule out a physical scaffolding model that depends on the amphipathic amino-terminal sequence of RGS4. While we cannot rule out a physical scaffold mechanism mediated by the RGS domain itself, these observations taken together prompted us to consider other mechanisms. Since the RGS specificity and concentration dependence in enhancing GTPase and [35S]GTPγS binding were strikingly similar and only the RGS GAP domain was required, we reasoned that these two phenomena might depend only on the GAP activity. Furthermore, the dependence of RGS-stimulated GTPγS binding on GTP versus GDP in the reaction mixture suggested a mechanism involving GTP hydrolysis. If a strong receptor stimulus caused sufficient accumulation of activated Gα-GTP to deplete the receptor substrate (i.e.heterotrimeric G-GDP) in the vicinity of receptor, then the GAP activity of the RGS could: restore local G-GDP substrate levels, permit receptor to stimulate more GDP release, produce more “empty” DRG state, and permit more GTPγS binding per unit time. Such a mechanism has been proposed for muscarinic receptors and Gq by Ross and co-workers (6Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 17Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In that case the effector, phospholipase C-β, serves as the GAP to maintain a complex of receptor/G protein/effector, but RGS4 can also enhance the rate of GTP binding and GTPase in that system (29Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To determine whether G-GDP depletion could account for our results, we constructed a kinetic model (Fig. 4) to examine RGS effects on receptor-G protein interactions and GTP hydrolysis. Simulating the presence of GTP (0.4 μm) in the face of a strong receptor stimulus, the steady state levels of G-GTP calculated by the model actually exceed those of G-GDP (Fig.4 B). This indicates that GDP release driven by the receptor can exceed the basal rate of GTP hydrolysis by the G protein. As RGS is added and the GTPase rate increases, the ratio of G-GDP/G-GTP increases. These results show that G-GDP substrate depletion is feasible with this set of reasonable kinetic parameters for the G protein cycle. In addition to enhancing the G-GDP to G-GTP ratio, RGS also increased the amount of nucleotide-free DRG (albeit still at low levels). We then asked whether this model could also replicate our experimental findings with steady state GTPase and GTPγS binding. Fig. 4 C shows that agonist-simulated GTP hydrolysis increased from 12 to 20 pmol/mg/min, and RGS was also able to increase GTPγS binding from 105 to 241 fmol/mg (Fig. 4 D). Interestingly, this effect was dependent on the GTP concentration, since modeling with a GTP concentration of 4 nm(i.e. the amount present endogenously in the membranes) showed a marginal effect on GTPγS binding (527–539 fmol/mg). Thus the kinetic model predicts that the ability of RGS to increase GTPγS binding should only be evident when GTP is included in the assay (Fig.4 D), which is consistent with our data. Thus, the structural data (Fig. 3 D) and model predictions (Figs. 2 Cand 4 D) are all consistent with the kinetic model in which enhanced GTPγS binding is caused simply by the accelerated GTP hydrolysis in the face of a strong receptor stimulus. To ensure that the effect of RGS to enhance [35S]GTPγS binding was not dependent on the long incubation times and very low GTPγS concentration used in these experiments, we also tested the effect of RGS4 on binding of 50 nm[35S]GTPγS (Fig. 5). In the presence of agonist, RGS4, and 1 μm GTP, [35S]GTPγS binding occurred very fast (t 12 ∼20 s), and a substantial fraction of the G protein pool was occupied (∼2 pmol/mg, about 20% of total Gi present in CHO cell membranes (24Gerhardt M.A. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 707-711PubMed Google Scholar)). Under these conditions, the RGS stimulation of agonist-induced [35S]GTPγS binding was even more striking. The chemical kinetic model, just described, assumes that reactions are occurring in a homogenous three-dimensional system with free mixing of all components. Since receptor-mediated G protein activation in cells occurs in a two-dimensional membrane which may have diffusion limitations, we used a Monte Carlo model similar to that developed by Mahama and Linderman (23Mahama P.A. Linderman J.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to examine spatial effects of the kinetic scaffolding mechanism. Simulations were run over a range of diffusion coefficients (10−10–10−8 cm2s−1) (30Kwon G. Axelrod D. Neubig R.R. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and GTP hydrolysis rates (from the intrinsic Gα GTPase rate of 0.02 s−1 to 200 s−1, a value exceeding measured RGS-stimulated rates of 5–30 s−1) (19Lan K.L. Zhong H.L. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 illustrates the results of these Monte Carlo simulations. With the lowest rate of GTP hydrolysis (k hyd 0.02 s−1) andD = 10−9 cm2 s−1(Fig. 5 A), a single receptor can activate the entire pool of 600 G proteins over the simulation area of 1 μm2 leading to profound and extensive G-GDP depletion (total G protein density is constant so G-GDP is almost fully depleted throughout the membrane system). As the RGS concentration and the rate of GTP hydrolysis increase, the envelope of active G protein (and depleted G-GDP) narrows. One can define the range of activity by the radius at which a given concentration of active G* is reached. Fig. 6 Billustrates, for different diffusion coefficients and GTPase rates, the distance from receptor at which the active G* level is 200 μm−2 or G protein is 40% active. The zone of active G* can range from less than 20 nm to over 450 nm depending on the RGS activity (i.e. k hyd) and the diffusion coefficient. At any given diffusion coefficient, RGS dramatically narrows the range of G protein activation around a single receptor or a cluster of receptors. Interestingly, the amount of active G protein immediately adjacent to the receptor (i.e. within about 10–20 nm) is not reduced significantly even at very high RGS concentrations, so an effector in close proximity would not show an RGS-dependent decrease in activity. Such an effect could explain the ability of RGS to speed the kinetics of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel responses without altering steady state activity (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In ongoing work, 5M. J. Clark, C. Harrison, H. Zhong, R. R. Neubig, and J. R. Traynor, submitted for publication. we show that three effector responses produced by the μ opioid receptor in a C6 glioma cell line are differentially sensitive to the influence of RGS proteins. Using an RGS-insensitive Gαo(19Lan K.L. Zhong H.L. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) it is shown that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of ERK are greatly enhanced in the absence of RGS effect while the increase in intracellular calcium is not. Thus different effectors may be differentially modulated by RGS action. Those results are consistent with the RGS-mediated kinetic scaffolding model proposed here (for example if the Ca2+ response effectors were more closely associated with μ opioid receptor and Gαo than those for adenylyl cylcase and ERK responses). Clearly other models may also account for the differential RGS effects, but kinetic scaffolding is one possible mechanism. RGS proteins play numerous roles in G protein signaling. They reduce G protein signals via their GAP activity and/or by competing for G protein binding to effectors (6Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 10De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). This inhibition of G protein signaling may be regulated either by changes in RGS expression (7Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) or perhaps by post-translational modifications (34De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RGS proteins are required for the fast kinetics of turnoff during ion channel regulation by G proteins (12Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 35Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RGS can participate in many other protein-protein interactions via amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions from the RGS domain (14Siderovski D.P. Strockbine B. Behe C.I. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 215-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These likely serve to coordinate signaling between heterotrimeric G proteins and low molecular weight Ras superfamily G proteins (36Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G.

They can also cause signal-dependent translocation of other types of regulatory molecules to the site of active Gα subunits (40Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and may play a role in nuclear processes (33Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J.X.

To this long list of established or hypothesized functions of RGS proteins, we present the concept of kinetic scaffolding and its contribution to spatial focusing of G protein signals. This may occur around a single receptor but could also play an important role in localizing signals around small clusters of receptors in dendrites or synaptic areas of neuronal cell bodies. Localization of ionotropic receptors in these regions is quite exquisite (4Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus the ability of RGS to narrow the spatial range of signal output from G protein-coupled receptors to the 10–100 nm scale could permit a similar fine localization of signaling via G protein systems.

There are at least five independent endocytic processes: clathrin-dependent endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles (100–150 nm in diameter), caveolin-dependent endocytosis mediated by caveolae (50–80 nm), clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis (2Robinson M.S.

Macropinocytosis provides an efficient process for non-selective uptake of nutrients and solute macromolecules.

Furthermore, macropinocytosis is postulated to play important roles in chemotaxis by regulating plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton interaction and membrane trafficking.

Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). This implies that the ruffling and macropinosome formation by these agents are mediated by Rac1. Rac1 causes membrane ruffling through its target protein IRSp53, which activates WAVE2/Scar2 (16Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 17Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T.

WAVE2 is involved in the formation of branched actin filament meshwork in membrane ruffles by activating Arp2/3 complex (18Takenawa T. Miki H. J.

It is well established that Rab proteins function in the targeting and docking of the vesicles to their acceptor membranes. However, it has become evident that at least some of them exert their functions in multiple steps of vesicular trafficking, including vesicle formation, vesicle motility, membrane remodeling, and vesicle fusion as well as vesicle targeting and docking (21Rodman J.S. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol.

Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, >50 members of Rab family proteins have been identified. These proteins are associated with particular vesicle membrane compartments and function in specific stages of the diverse vesicle trafficking events. Among them, Rab5 is located to the membranes of clathrin-coated vesicles and early endosomes. It is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluid-phase pinocytosis (25Bucchi C. Parton R.G.

Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Introduction of a constitutively active Rab5 mutant in cells stimulates the rate of endocytosis and homotypic fusion of early endosomes, whereas its dominant-negative mutant prevents the vesicle fusion (26Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Rab4 is also present in early endosome membrane and implicated in recycling pathway from endosomes to the plasma membrane (28van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Mâle P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Rab7 is present in late endosome membrane and participates in transport from early to late endosomes and lysosomes (29Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 30Méresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a mutant Rab5 protein defective in GTP-binding ability retards fluid-phase pinocytosis in addition to receptor-mediated endocytosis (25Bucchi C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), there has been no report indicating that any Rab family proteins are specifically located to the membrane ruffles or macropinosomes and play direct roles in macropinosome formation. Rah is a small GTPase postulated to be a member of Rab family due to the similarity of its effector domain and C-terminal sequences to those of several Rab proteins (31Morimoto B.H. Chuang C.-C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2386-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because only a truncated cDNA lacking the sequence encoding N-terminal portion was available (31Morimoto B.H. Chuang C.-C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2386-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we have cloned in the present study the cDNA containing the entire coding region of mouse Rah. Rah was colocalized with actin to the membrane ruffles and macropinosome membrane. During macropinosome biogenesis, Rah associated with nascent macropinosomes seemed to be replaced by Rab5 on the early endosomes. Overexpression of Rah elevated the number of macropinosomes, whereas the expression of a dominant-negative form of Rah prevented the formation of macropinosomes induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or PMA. On the other hand, Rah-promoted macropinosome formation was retarded by dominant-negative mutants of Rac1 and WAVE2. Thus, Rah is likely to play crucial roles in the formation of macropinosomes from the membrane ruffles. Mouse heart total RNA was prepared according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the total RNA with Oligotex-dT30 Super (Roche Diagnostics). A single-stranded cDNA pool was synthesized with SuperScript II RNase H(−) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from the poly(A)+ RNA primed with an oligo(dT) primer. A Rah cDNA fragment was cloned from the cDNA pool by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen) by using a sense primer 5′-AAGGTCATCGTTGTGGGAGA-3′ (nucleotides 7–26 of the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession number S72304) and an antisense primer 5′-GGGACAACATGTGGCCTTTT-3′ (nucleotides 605–624). The cDNA library of the mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2 myoblasts constructed in λZAPII (33Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was screened with the PCR product. Rab5b cDNA containing the entire coding region was cloned from the heart cDNA pool by RT-PCR using a sense primer 5′-GGAGGACATATGACTAGCAG-3′ (nucleotides 42–61 of the accession number X84239) and an antisense primer 5′-CACCCCTCAGTTGCTACAAC-3′ (nucleotides 685–704). Mouse H-Ras and Rac1 cDNAs were cloned as described previously (33Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNAs was determined with a LI-COR LI-COR 4000 automated DNA sequencing system using a SequiTherm Long-Read Cycle Sequencing Kit-LC (Epicentre Technologies). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed with GENETYX-Mac software (version 10.1, Software Development Co.). Point mutations to generate Rah(Q111L) and Rah(T66N) analogous to a constitutively active form of Ras(Q61L) and a dominant-negative form of Ras(S17N), respectively, were introduced in Rah cDNA with a Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). Similarly, point mutations to generate constitutively active Rab5(Q79L) and dominant-negative Rab5(S34N) were introduced in Rab5 cDNA. Coding sequences of the wild-type (wt) or the mutated Rah and Rab5 were fused in-frame to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) in pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). These recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (34Tsubakimoto K. Matsumoto K. Abe H. Ishii J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Endo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An in vitroGTP binding/GTPase assay of the recombinant GST fusion proteins by thin-layer chromatography was carried out as described previously (33Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, each GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with 370 kBq of [α-32P]GTP (>111 TBq/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) in the incubation buffer (50 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10 μm ATP) at 37 °C for 10 min. After washing with the wash buffer (20 mm MgCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), a GTPase reaction was carried out in the assay buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm GTP) at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of the ice-cold wash buffer. After washing with the wash buffer, bound nucleotides were eluted by incubating the Sepharose beads in 1% SDS and 20 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 5 min. Dissociated samples were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Macherey-Nagel). The released nucleotides were resolved by thin-layer chromatography in 0.75 m KH2PO4 and visualized by autoradiography. An in vivo GTP binding/GTPase assay was conducted essentially according to Muroya et al. (35Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar). The entire coding region of the wt or the constitutively active Rah and Rab5 was fused in-frame to the Myc tag in pEF-BOS vector. COS-1 cells (36Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (growth medium) were transfected with these plasmids by using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twelve hours after the transfection, the medium was replaced with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9). Phosphorus 32 (32Pi) (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) was added to the medium at 9.25 MBq/ml and incubated for a further 12 h. The cells were lysed with the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody Myc1–9E10 (37Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection) was added to the cell lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min, and then Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was mixed and incubated for a further 60 min. After thorough washing with the lysis buffer, bound nucleotides were dissociated with the dissociation buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mmGDP, and 0.5 mm GTP) at 65 °C for 5 min. Four microliters each of the dissociated samples was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography followed by autoradiography. Entire coding region of the wt or the mutated Rah and Rab5 were fused in-frame to the Myc tag in pCMVmyc vector (33Matsumoto K. Asano T. Endo T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), to the hemagglutinin (HA) tag in pEF-BOS vector, and to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence in pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Human WAVE2 and its dominant-negative mutant WAVE2(ΔV) were fused to the FLAG tag in pEF-BOS vector and to EGFP in pEGFP-C1 vector (38Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The mouse C3H/10T1/2 (10T1/2) fibroblasts (39Reznikoff C.A. Brankow D.W. Heidelberger C. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 3231-3238PubMed Google Scholar), cultured on glass coverslips in the growth medium, were transfected with these plasmids by the calcium phosphate-mediated method as described previously (40Endo T. Matsumoto K. Hama T. Ohtsuka Y. Katsura G. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To detect macropinosomes, rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC)-dextran (M r∼ 70,000, Sigma) was added to the medium at the concentration of 1 mg/ml. To induce macropinocytosis, the cells were treated with 5 units/ml PDGF (Calbiochem) or 0.1 μm PMA (Sigma) for 30 min. The transiently transfected cells were processed for fluorescence microscopy 24 h after the transfection (40Endo T. Matsumoto K. Hama T. Ohtsuka Y. Katsura G. Obinata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fixed and permeabilized cells transfected with Myc-, HA-, and FLAG-tagging constructs were incubated with the mAb Myc1–9E10, anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (MBL), and anti-FLAG tag mAb (Sigma), respectively. Then they were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (affinity-purified, Cappel). Actin filaments were detected by the staining with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Lamp1 was detected by the staining with mAb H4A3 (41Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) followed by the incubation with rhodamine-goat anti-mouse IgG. The specimens were observed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with phase-contrast and epifluorescence optics. The number of macropinosomes was estimated by counting relatively large vesicles (0.2–5 μm in diameter) surrounded by actin in >100 transfected cells in each transfection experiment. Living 10T1/2 cells transfected with the pEGFP-C1 constructs were observed with a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV microscope equipped with phase-contrast and epifluorescence optics. The EGFP fluorescence was recorded through a CoolSNAP digital charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific) and analyzed by IPLab/Mac imaging software (Scanalytics, Inc.). Because Rah cDNA available at that time had lacked the sequence corresponding to the N-terminal region (31Morimoto B.H. Chuang C.-C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2386-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we tried to obtain cDNA containing the entire coding region and cloned a 1.6-kb cDNA (accession numberAB082927) from the mouse C2 skeletal muscle myoblast cDNA library. Because there was an in-frame termination codon (T416AA) upstream of A503TG in this clone, this ATG is most likely to serve the initiation codon. The coding region of the former truncated clone contains 208 amino acids (31Morimoto B.H. Chuang C.-C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2386-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas that of this clone consisted of 259 amino acids and its calculated molecular weight was 29,128. Because Rah was most similar to Rab family proteins among small GTPase families and its amino acid sequence was identical to that of mouse Rab34 (accession number BC038638, the data of which were submitted while we were submitting this report), we compared its amino acid sequence with those of several other Rab family proteins (Fig. 1 A). Rah/Rab34 had the longest N-terminal sequence among Rab family proteins except for Rab36 (see Fig. 1 B). Small GTPases generally contain conserved four sequence motifs for GTP/GDP-binding and GTPase activities (42Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 43Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although Rah contained the first three motif sequences, it lacked the consensus sequence for the fourth motif (EXSA) (X, any amino acid) (Fig. 1 A). The sequence of the putative effector domain of Rah was distinct from those of the other Rab family proteins, suggesting that Rah exerts unique cellular functions. The C termini of unprocessed Rab proteins usually end with -CC, -CCX 1–3, or -CXC, and the cysteine residues in these motifs are postulated to be geranylgeranylated (44Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal end of Rah was -CCP, it coincides with the motifs. Rab36 is a recently identified Rab family protein encoded by the gene locating at 22q11.2, but its function has totally been unknown (45Mori T. Fukuda Y. Kuroda H. Matsumura T. Ota S. Sugimoto T. Nakamura Y. Inazawa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is the largest Rab family small GTPase to date consisting of 333 amino acids with extremely long N-terminal sequence (Fig. 1 B). Rah was most closely related to Rab36, and the identity between the two proteins was 57% over the entire length of Rah (Fig. 1 B). Even the long N-terminal portion of Rah showed a similarity to the corresponding region of Rab36. Notably, the sequences of their putative effector domains were identical, and, in addition, sequences around the effector domains were also relatively well conserved between these two proteins. The fourth motif for GTP/GDP binding was abrogated also in Rab36. The consensus sequence for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases ((R/K)X 2–3(D/E)X 2–3 Y) was present in Rah as well as in Rab36. This putatively phosphorylatable tyrosine corresponds to the first amino acid of the effector domain. This might suggest that binding of target proteins to Rah and Rab36 is regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation. Small GTPases basically exhibit GTP/GDP-binding and intrinsic GTPase activities. We analyzed these activities of Rah and Rab5 in vitro by thin-layer chromatography. Point mutations were introduced in the cDNA to generate Rah(Q111L) and Rah(T66N), which are equivalent to a constitutively active form (a mutant deficient in GTP hydrolysis) of Ras(Q61L) or Rab5(Q79L) (26Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) and a dominant-negative form (a mutant stabilized in GDP-bound form) of Ras(S17N) or Rab5(S34N) (26Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), respectively. The GST-tagged proteins of the wt and these mutants expressed in E. coliwere used for the analyses of the activities. Although Rab5(wt) easily hydrolyzed bound GTP into GDP, Rah(wt) hydrolyzed bound GTP much less efficiently (Fig. 2 A). Rah(Q111L) and Rab5(Q79L) were deficient in GTP-hydrolyzing activity. Rah(T66N) was lacking in GTP-binding ability as was Rab5(S34N). The low intrinsic GTPase activity of Rah(wt) might be ascribable to the lack of the fourth motif for GTP/GDP-binding and GTPase activities. We further analyzed these activities of Rah and Rab5 in vivo. Myc-tagged wt and constitutively active mutants of Rah and Rab5 were transiently transfected to COS-1 cells. Each of these proteins labeled with 32Pi was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc mAb, and the bound guanine nucleotides were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. Rab5(wt) bound a high amount of GDP and much less GTP, whereas Rab5(Q79L) bound almost equivalent amounts of GTP and GDP (Fig. 2 B). Remarkably, Rah(wt) bound a low amount of GTP and a high amount of GDP as did Rab5(wt). Furthermore, Rah(Q111L) bound less GTP than did Rab5(Q79L). These results imply that, in contrast with the low GTPase activity in vitro, Rah(wt) exhibits a considerable level of GTPase activity in vivo comparable to the activity of Rab5(wt). They also indicate that even the constitutively active mutants exert appreciable GTPase activity in vivo. This is presumably due to the presence of GTPase-activating protein (GAP) in cells. Indeed, GAP activity stimulates GTPase activity of the constitutively active Rab3A in vivo (46Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9410-9415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, specific GAPs are likely to exert their functions not only on Rab5(wt) but also on Rah(wt) and on both these constitutively active mutants in vivo. To infer cellular functions of Rah, we first determined the localization of Rah. Myc-epitope-tagged or EGFP-tagged Rah and its point mutants were transiently expressed in mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts by transfection. Myc-tagged wt Rah was predominantly located to the cell surface membrane ruffles and membranes of relatively large (usually several μm in diameter) vesicles adjacent to the ruffles (Fig. 3, a andb). Staining with rhodamine-phalloidin showed that actin coexisted with Rah in these membrane structures (Fig. 3, cand d). Myc-Rah(Q111L) was also located to these membrane structures, and the phenotype of Myc-Rah(Q111L)-expressing cells was indistinguishable from that of the Myc-Rah(wt)-expressing cells (Fig. 3, e–h). On the other hand, most of the Myc-tagged dominant-negative Rah(T66N) was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and also associated with membrane ruffles but not with the vesicles, even if they existed (Fig. 3,i–l). EGFP-tagged Rah(wt) and the point mutants distributed in the cells similarly to each of the Myc-tagged proteins (data not shown). Rab5 is located to the membranes of early endosomes, and expression of the constitutively active Rab5(Q79L) causes the formation of unusually large endosomes by the homotypic fusion of early endosomes (25Bucchi C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 26Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). To identify the Rah-associated vesicles, Myc- or EGFP-tagged Rab5(wt), Rab5(Q79L), and the dominant-negative Rab5(S34N) were expressed in 10T1/2 cells. Both Rab5(wt) and Rab5(Q79L) were localized to the early endosome membranes, and actin was associated with the membranes of only some but not all of the endosomes (Fig. 4 A,a–f). The endosomes associated with actin seem to be macropinosomes and those without actin association are likely to be either receptor-mediated endosomes or macropinosomes at later stages. Expression of Rab5(Q79L) resulted in the formation of large endosomes as much as 10–20 μm in diameter (Fig. 4 A,d–f). In contrast, Rab5(S34N) was apparently diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4"
https://openalex.org/W2002113583,"Maturation of epiphyseal growth plate chondrocytes plays an important role in endochondral bone formation. Previously, we demonstrated that retinoic acid (RA) treatment stimulated annexin-mediated Ca2+ influx into growth plate chondrocytes leading to a significant increase in cytosolic Ca2+, whereas K-201, a specific annexin Ca2+channel blocker, inhibited this increase markedly. The present study addressed the hypothesis that annexin-mediated Ca2+ influx into growth plate chondrocytes is a major regulator of terminal differentiation, mineralization, and apoptosis of these cells. We found that K-201 significantly reduced up-regulation of expression of terminal differentiation marker genes, such as cbfa1, alkaline phosphatase (APase), osteocalcin, and type I collagen in RA-treated cultures. Furthermore, K-201 inhibited up-regulation of annexin II, V, and VI gene expression in these cells. RA-treated chondrocytes released mineralization-competent matrix vesicles, which contained significantly higher amounts of annexins II, V, and VI as well as APase activity than vesicles isolated from untreated or RA/K-201-treated cultures. Consistently, only RA-treated cultures showed significant mineralization. RA treatment stimulated the whole sequence of terminal differentiation events, including apoptosis as the final event. After a 6-day treatment gene expression ofbcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, was down-regulated, whereas caspase-3 activity and the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in RA-treated cultures compared with untreated cultures. Interestingly, the cytosolic calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and K-201 protected RA-treated chondrocytes from undergoing apoptotic changes, as indicated by higher bcl-2 gene expression, reduced caspase-3 activity, and the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells. In conclusion, annexin-mediated Ca2+influx into growth plate chondrocytes is a positive regulator of terminal differentiation, mineralization, and apoptosis events in growth plate chondrocytes.

In conclusion, annexin-mediated Ca2+influx into growth plate chondrocytes is a positive regulator of terminal differentiation, mineralization, and apoptosis events in growth plate chondrocytes. retinoic acid alkaline phosphatase activity retinoic acid receptor phosphate-buffered saline 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling Maturation of epiphyseal growth plate chondrocytes, which plays an important role during endochondral ossification, is accompanied by major changes of chondrocyte morphology, biosynthetic activities, and energy metabolism. These processes involve an ordered progression of various cell differentiation stages, including proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation, terminal differentiation, and ultimately programmed cell death (apoptosis) (1Hickok N.J. Haas A.R. Tuan R.S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 174-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Gibson G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). During normal development these sequential events are under the strict control of local and systematic factors such as hormones and growth factors. If these processes, however, occur during pathological conditions, they can result in serious cartilage or bone defects. Evidence of endochondral ossification is also seen during osteophyte formation in osteoarthritic cartilage (3Hoyland J.A. Thomas J.T. Donn R. Marriott A. Ayadh S. Boot-Handford R.P. Grant M.E.

Terminal differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes is an essential process, which primes the cartilage skeleton for its subsequent invasion by osteoblasts and its replacement by a bone matrix. Despite the obvious importance of these terminal differentiation events still little is known about mechanisms regulating these processes. cbfa1, a member of the runt domain family of transcription factors, was originally discovered as a key transcription factor, which controls osteoblast differentiation. In cbfa1-null mice no endochondral and intramembranous bone formation occurs due to an arrest in osteoblast differentiation (5Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S.

Recent studies have indicated that cbfa1 also plays an important regulative role in terminal chondrocyte maturation. Transgenic mice, which overexpresscbfa1 in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes, display an acceleration of endochondral ossification. Overexpression ofcbfa1 in chondrocytes of cbfa1-null mice partially rescued the abnormalities of cbfa1-null mutant mice. In particular, it rescued hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation in the humerus and femur (9Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Thus, cbfa1seems to play dual functions in endochondral bone formation; it plays a key role in osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal precursor cells, and it has the ability to stimulate hypertrophic and terminal chondrocyte differentiation. Chondrocyte hypertrophy and terminal differentiation are accompanied by an increase in cytosolic calcium, [Ca2+]i(10Iannotti J.P. Brighton C.T. J. Orthop. Res. 1989; 7: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Gunter T.E. Zuscik M.J. Puzas J.E. Gunter K.K. Rosier R.N. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Kirsch T. Swoboda B. von der Mark K. Differentiation. 1992; 52: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Calcium is recognized as an important regulator of many cellular processes, and it controls a diverse range of cell functions, including adhesion, motility, gene expression, cell differentiation, and proliferation. For example, the amplitude and duration of calcium signals control differential activation of different transcription factors in B lymphocytes (13Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Calcium has been shown to play several roles in vesiculation and the formation of vesicles. For example, Iannotti et al. (14Iannotti J.P. Naidu S. Noguchi Y. Hunt R.M. Brighton C.T. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1994; 306: 222-229PubMed Google Scholar) have shown a correlation between increasing [Ca2+]i and the release of matrix vesicles (14Iannotti J.P. Naidu S. Noguchi Y. Hunt R.M. Brighton C.T. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1994; 306: 222-229PubMed Google Scholar). Matrix vesicles are small membrane-enclosed particles, which are released from the plasma membrane of growth plate chondrocytes and which initiate the mineralization process (15Anderson H.C. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1995; 314: 266-280PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that RA,1 which stimulates terminal differentiation and mineralization of hypertrophic chondrocytes, induces Ca2+ influx into growth plate chondrocytes causing the release of mineralization-competent matrix vesicles (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Annexins II, V, and VI, which are highly expressed in hypertrophic and mineralizing growth plate cartilage, are major components of matrix vesicles (17Kirsch T. Swoboda B. Nah H.-D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Pfander D. Swoboda B. Kirsch T. Am. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Annexins II, V, and VI belong to a family of Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding proteins. In addition, annexins II, V, and VI have been shown to form Ca2+channels in phospholipid bilayers or in liposomes (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). They also form Ca2+ channels in matrix vesicles enabling Ca2+influx into these particles as a possible initial step for the formation of the first mineral phase within the vesicle lumen (21Kirsch T. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Nah H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35577-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Careful studies have provided evidence that apoptosis is the final fate of terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocytes. Chondrocyte apoptosis in the growth plate is centered at the site of the transition of cartilage to bone (2Gibson G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Hatori M. Klatte K.J. Teixeira C.C. Shapiro I.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These apoptotic chondrocytes show characteristic hallmarks of apoptosis, including condensed nuclei, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase cascade, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Previous studies have indicated that elevation of [Ca2+]i is involved in the induction of apoptosis. For example, apoptosis of cultured human endothelial cells was inhibited by chelating extracellular calcium with EGTA or by inhibiting the calcium influx by calcium channel blockers. It has been suggested that elevated [Ca2+]i leads to activation of proteases, lipases, and nucleases. All these actions can contribute to cell death (23Waring P. Beaver J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Escargueilblanc I. Meilhac O. Pieraggi M.T. Arnal J.F. Salvayre R. Negresalvayre A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Invest. 1998; 102: 1454-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have provided evidence that RA promotes annexin channel formation in growth plate chondrocytes and that annexin-mediated Ca2+influx into these cells controls Ca2+ homeostasis (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine the role of annexin-mediated alteration of Ca2+homeostasis in terminal differentiation, mineralization, and apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes, we cotreated growth plate chondrocytes isolated from the hypertrophic zone of day 19 embryonic chicken growth plate cartilage with RA and K-201, a specific annexin channel blocker, or RA and BAPTA-AM, a cytosolic Ca2+ chelator, and analyzed the rate of terminal differentiation, mineralization, and apoptosis in these cells. Chondrocytes were isolated from the hypertrophic zone of day 19 embryonic chick tibia growth plate cartilage as described previously (19Kirsch T. Nah H.D. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, sliced growth plate cartilage was digested with 0.25% trypsin and 0.05% collagenase for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 106 in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and grown in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (complete medium). After cultures reached confluency, chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of 1.5 mmphosphate and in the absence or presence of (a) 35 nm RA (Sigma-Aldrich), (b) 35 nm RA and 2 μm 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative K-201 (JTV519) (provided by Drs. Noboro Kareko, Dokkyo University, Tochigo, Japan and Toshizo Tanaka, Japan Tobacco Inc., Osaka, Japan), and (c) 35 nm RA and 10 μm BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Total RNA was isolated from untreated, RA-treated, RA/K-201-treated, and RA/BAPTA-treated chondrocyte cultures after 1-, 3-, 5-day treatments using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Stanford, CA). 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Ominiscript RT Kit (Qiagen). A 1:100 dilution of the resulting cDNA was used as the template to quantify the relative content of mRNA by real time PCR (ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system) using respective primers and SYBR Green. The following primers for real time PCR were designed using Primer Express software. Annexin II: forward primer, 5′-CATGCCTATCTGCTCTTCGTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGCCACCACACCGTCCATAA-3′; annexin V: forward primer, 5′-AGAGACATCAGGCCATTTTCAGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTGCCATCAGGATCTCTATTTGC-3′; annexin VI: forward primer, 5′-GCGGCTGATTGTAAGCTTGAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCGGTGGTCCAGCACTTA-3′; type I collagen (α1(I)): forward primer, 5′-CAGCCGCTTCACCTACAGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTTTGTATTCAATCACTGTCTTGCC-3′; type II collagen: forward primer, 5′-GGCAATAGCAGGTTCACGTAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGATAACAGTCTTGCCCCACTT-3′; type X collagen: forward primer, 5′-AGTGCTGTCATTGATCTCATGGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCAGAGGAATAGAGACCATTGGATT-3′; cbfa1: forward primer, 5′-CGCGGAGCTGCGAAAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACGAATCGCAGGTCATTGAAT-3′; APase: forward primer, 5′-CCCTGACATCGAGGTGATCCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGTACTCCACATCGCTGGTGTT-3′; osteocalcin: forward primer, 5′-TCGCGGCGCTGCTCACATTCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGCGGTGGGAGATGAAGGCTTTA-3′; bcl-2: forward primer, 5′-GGTGACCCGAAGCATCAAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGCGACACGAAAACCCAAAC-3′. PCR reactions were performed with the TaqMan PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems) using 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The 18 S RNA was amplified at the same time and used as an internal control. The cycle threshold values for 18 S RNA and that of the samples were measured and calculated by computer software. Relative transcript levels were calculated asx = 2−ΔΔ Ct , in which ΔΔCt = ΔE − ΔC and ΔE = Ct exp −Ct 18 S; ΔC =Ct ctl − Ct 18 S. Matrix vesicles were isolated from chondrocyte cultures after a 6-day treatment by enzymatic digestion and ultracentrifugation as described previously (19Kirsch T. Nah H.D. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). APase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate as described previously (19Kirsch T. Nah H.D. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Protein content was analyzed by the BCA protein assay from Pierce. To determine the amounts of annexin II, V, and VI in matrix vesicles, vesicle fractions (total protein of 30 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with primary antibodies specific for annexins II, V, and VI. Samples were dissolved in 4× NuPAGE SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Prior to electrophoresis, the reducing reagent was added to the sample solution, denatured at 70 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis in 10% Bis-Tris gels following the NuPAGE electrophoresis protocols. Samples were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters after electrophoresis. After blocking with a solution of low fat milk protein, blotted proteins were immunostained with primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescene (Pierce). To determine the degree of mineralization chondrocyte cultures were stained with alizarin red S after a 6-day treatment as described previously (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, chondrocyte cultures were fixed with 70% ethanol and then stained with 0.5% alizarin red S solution, pH 4.0, for 5 min at room temperature. To quantify the intensity of alizarin red S staining, alizarin red S-stained cultures were incubated with 100 mmcetylpyridinium chloride for 1 h to solubilize and release calcium-bound alizarin red S into solution (26Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The absorbance of the released alizarin red S staining was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. Data were expressed as units of alizarin red S released per mg of protein in each culture. Caspase-3 activity was determined using the ApoAlert caspase fluorescent assay kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after a 6-day treatment chondrocyte cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into tubes, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were washed one more time with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged again. Then air-dried cell pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of chilled cell lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and 50 μl of 2 × reaction buffer/dithiothreitol mixture and 5 μl of 1 mm caspase-3 substrate (DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) were added to 50 μl of each sample and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Caspase-3 activity was measured in a fluorimeter (Photon Technology Instruments) using the excitation wavelength of 400 nm and the emission wavelength of 505 nm. Caspase-3 activity was quantitated using 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin standard and normalized to the protein content in each culture. Apoptotic chondrocytes in day 6 chondrocyte cultures were detected using ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kit to label apoptotic cells by modifying genomic DNA utilizing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY). Briefly, chondrocytes were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution (pH 7.4) for 10 min. Then fixed chondrocytes were incubated with 1% Triton/PBS solution, followed by incubation with a proteinase K solution (20 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide/PBS for 5 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidases, followed by rinsing with PBS and incubation with equilibration buffer. Samples were incubated with a reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme and digoxigenin-labeled dNTPs at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. After 1 h, the reaction was stopped, and digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides were detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies in a humidified chamber for 30 min at room temperature. The signal was detected using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a color substrate. Sections were counterstained with methylene green, mounted, and viewed under an Olympus microscope. To gain insights into the extent of apoptosis in the various chondrocyte cultures, the percentage of stained cells was determined. 500 chondrocytes were counted in 10 randomly chosen areas of three different cultures. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the percentage of total cells that show TUNEL staining. Numerical data are presented as mean ± S.D. (n > 4), and statistical significance between groups was identified using the two-tailed Student's t test (p values are reported in the figure legends). Treatment of hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes with RA induced terminal differentiation of these cells, as indicated by up-regulation of terminal differentiation marker genes, includingcbfa1 (Fig. 1 A), APase (Fig. 1 B), and osteocalcin (Fig. 1 C), compared with the expression levels in untreated cells. An approximately 9-fold increase in cbfa1 gene expression was detected after a 3-day treatment, whereas APase gene expression was up-regulated by ∼16-fold after a 5-day treatment, and osteocalcin gene expression increased ∼16-fold after a 3-day treatment and ∼14-fold after a 5-day treatment. Furthermore, alizarin red S staining revealed that RA-treated cultures were heavily mineralized after a 6-day treatment, whereas untreated cultures showed only little signs of mineralization (Fig. 2). Previously, we have shown that RA treatment led to a 3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i of growth plate chondrocytes compared with the concentration of untreated cells. In addition, we provided evidence that most of this increase was mediated by Ca2+influx through annexin channels (16Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that annexin-mediated Ca2+ influx into growth plate chondrocytes regulates terminal differentiation events of these cells. To test this hypothesis, we cotreated cells with RA and the annexin-specific Ca2+ channel blocker K-201 or antibodies specific for annexin V. Blocking annexin channel activities with K-201 led to a significant reduction of cbfa1, APase, and osteocalcin gene expression (Fig. 1), and mineralization of RA-treated chondrocyte cultures (Fig. 2). We have previously shown that antibodies specific for annexin V blocked its Ca2+ channel activities (26Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cotreatment of RA-treated cultures with antibodies specific for annexin V also significantly reduced the rate of mineralization compared with the degree of mineralization in RA-treated cultures (Fig. 2).Figure 2Extent of matrix mineralization in chondrocyte cultures treated with RA , RA and K-201, or RA and antibodies specific for annexin V. Hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes were treated with RA, RA/K-201, or RA/anti-annexin V IgGs for 6 days.

Note the intense staining in RA-treated cultures, while untreated, RA/K-201-, and RA/anti-annexin V IgG-treated cultures showed little staining. B, to quantitate alizarin red S staining, alizarin red S-stained cultures were incubated with 100 mmcetylpyridium chloride for 1 h. The alizarin red staining released into the solution was collected, diluted when necessary, and read as units of alizarin red released (1 unit is equivalent to 1 unit of absorbance density at 570 nm) per mg of protein. Data were obtained from four different experiments, and values are mean ± S.D.

K-201 significantly reduced the up-regulation of annexin II, V, and VI gene expression in RA-treated cultures to levels similar to untreated cultures (Fig. 3, A,B, and C). Type I collagen gene expression was up-regulated in RA-treated cultures (Fig. 4 A), whereas type II collagen gene expression was down-regulated in these cultures (Fig. 4 B). Cultures cotreated with RA and K-201 showed levels of type I and II collagen gene expression similar to levels in untreated cultures (Fig. 4, A and B). Type X collagen gene expression was not affected by RA or RA/K-201 treatment (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4Quantitative real time PCR analysis of type I (A), II (B), and X (C) collagen gene expression in untreated, RA-treated, and RA/K-201-treated growth plate chondrocytes. Total RNA was isolated from day 1, 3, and 5 untreated, RA-, and RA/K-201-treated chondrocytes. Gene expressions of type I collagen (A), type II collagen (B), and type X collagen (C) were detected by quantitative real time PCR. Data were obtained from triplicated PCR reactions of three different cultures, and values are mean ± S.D. (*, p ≤ 0.01; **, p≤ 0.05; RA versus untreated or RA/K-201 treatment).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have demonstrated that RA treatment led to the release of mineralization-competent APase and annexin II-, V-, and VI-containing matrix vesicles, whereas untreated chondrocytes released vesicles that contain no or little APase activity and annexins II, V, and VI (16; see also Fig. 5). Cotreatment of chondrocytes with RA and K-201 significantly reduced the amounts of APase activity (Fig. 5 A) and annexins II, V, and VI (Fig. 5 B) in matrix vesicle fractions. Thus, annexin-mediated Ca2+influx into growth plate chondrocytes regulates expression of terminal differentiation marker genes, the release of APase- and annexin II-, V-, and VI-containing matrix vesicles, and subsequent mineralization. It is now well established that the final fate of terminally differentiated chondrocytes is apoptosis (2Gibson G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the question of whether RA triggers the whole cascade of terminal differentiation events including apoptosis and whether annexin-mediated Ca2+ influx into chondrocytes is also involved in the regulation of apoptotic changes. To determine the degree of apoptosis in the various treated chondrocyte cultures we measuredbcl-2 gene expression and caspase-3 activity and performed TUNEL labeling. A 5-day treatment with RA led to a significant decrease in gene expression of bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein (27Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). In contrast, caspase-3 activity, an active cell death protease involved in the execution phase of apoptosis (28Porter A.G. Janicke R.U. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar), was more than 5-fold elevated in cultures treated for 6 days with RA compared with untreated cells (Fig. 7). Cotreatment of cultures with RA and the cytosolic Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM abolished the decrease in bcl-2 gene expression (Fig. 6) and the increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 7), suggesting that cytosolic calcium is directly involved in the regulation of apoptotic events. Interestingly,bcl-2 gene expression was also higher in RA/K-201-treated cells than in RA-treated cells (Fig. 6), whereas caspase-3 activity was lower (Fig. 7). In addition, TUNEL labeling revealed that in RA-treated cultures more than 10% of cells were TUNEL-positive, whereas only ∼2% were TUNEL-positive in untreated and RA/BAPTA-treated cells, and ∼4% of cells were TUNEL-positive in RA/K-201-treated cultures (Fig. 8).Figure 7Caspase-3 activity in untreated, RA -, RA/K-201-, and RA/BAPTA-treated growth plate chondrocytes. After a 6-day treatment, caspase-3 activities in untreated, RA-, RA/K-201-, and RA/BAPTA-treated chondrocytes were determined using the ApoAlert caspase fluorescent assay kit as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Caspase-3 activity was calibrated with AFC calibration curve and normalized to the protein content in each culture. Data were obtained from four different experiments, and values are mean ± S.D. (*, p ≤ 0.01; RA versus RA/K-201 treatment, RA versus RA/BAPTA treatment).View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2089353933,"Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolizes a wide range of therapeutic drugs. CYP2D6 substrates typically contain a basic nitrogen atom, and the active-site residue Asp-301 has been implicated in substrate recognition through electrostatic interactions. Our recent computational models point to a predominantly structural role for Asp-301 in loop positioning (Kirton, S. B., Kemp, C. A., Tomkinson, N. P., St.-Gallay, S., and Sutcliffe, M. J. (2002) Proteins 49, 216–231) and suggest a second acidic residue, Glu-216, as a key determinant in the binding of basic substrates. We have evaluated the role of Glu-216 in substrate recognition, along with Asp-301, by site-directed mutagenesis. Reversal of the Glu-216 charge to Lys or substitution with neutral residues (Gln, Phe, or Leu) greatly decreased the affinity (K m values increased 10–100-fold) for the classical basic nitrogen-containing substrates bufuralol and dextromethorphan. Altered binding was also manifested in significant differences in regiospecificity with respect to dextromethorphan, producing enzymes with no preference for N-demethylationversus O-demethylation (E216K and E216F). Neutralization of Asp-301 to Gln and Asn had similarly profound effects on substrate binding and regioselectivity. Intriguingly, removal of the negative charge from either 216 or 301 produced enzymes (E216A, E216K, and D301Q) with elevated levels (50–75-fold) of catalytic activity toward diclofenac, a carboxylate-containing CYP2C9 substrate that lacks a basic nitrogen atom. Activity was increased still further (>1000-fold) upon neutralization of both residues (E216Q/D301Q). The kinetic parameters for diclofenac (K m 108 μm,k cat 5 min−1) along with nifedipine (K m 28 μm,k cat 2 min−1) and tolbutamide (K m 315 μm,k cat 1 min−1), which are not normally substrates for CYP2D6, were within an order of magnitude of those observed with CYP3A4 or CYP2C9. Neutralizing both Glu-216 and Asp-301 thus effectively alters substrate recognition illustrating the central role of the negative charges provided by both residues in defining the specificity of CYP2D6 toward substrates containing a basic nitrogen. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolizes a wide range of therapeutic drugs. CYP2D6 substrates typically contain a basic nitrogen atom, and the active-site residue Asp-301 has been implicated in substrate recognition through electrostatic interactions. Our recent computational models point to a predominantly structural role for Asp-301 in loop positioning (Kirton, S. B., Kemp, C. A., Tomkinson, N. P., St.-Gallay, S., and Sutcliffe, M. J. (2002) Proteins 49, 216–231) and suggest a second acidic residue, Glu-216, as a key determinant in the binding of basic substrates. We have evaluated the role of Glu-216 in substrate recognition, along with Asp-301, by site-directed mutagenesis. Reversal of the Glu-216 charge to Lys or substitution with neutral residues (Gln, Phe, or Leu) greatly decreased the affinity (K m values increased 10–100-fold) for the classical basic nitrogen-containing substrates bufuralol and dextromethorphan. Altered binding was also manifested in significant differences in regiospecificity with respect to dextromethorphan, producing enzymes with no preference for N-demethylationversus O-demethylation (E216K and E216F). Neutralization of Asp-301 to Gln and Asn had similarly profound effects on substrate binding and regioselectivity. Intriguingly, removal of the negative charge from either 216 or 301 produced enzymes (E216A, E216K, and D301Q) with elevated levels (50–75-fold) of catalytic activity toward diclofenac, a carboxylate-containing CYP2C9 substrate that lacks a basic nitrogen atom. Activity was increased still further (>1000-fold) upon neutralization of both residues (E216Q/D301Q). The kinetic parameters for diclofenac (K m 108 μm,k cat 5 min−1) along with nifedipine (K m 28 μm,k cat 2 min−1) and tolbutamide (K m 315 μm,k cat 1 min−1), which are not normally substrates for CYP2D6, were within an order of magnitude of those observed with CYP3A4 or CYP2C9. Neutralizing both Glu-216 and Asp-301 thus effectively alters substrate recognition illustrating the central role of the negative charges provided by both residues in defining the specificity of CYP2D6 toward substrates containing a basic nitrogen. cytochrome P450 2D6 high pressure liquid chromatography 3-methoxymorphinan Cytochromes P450 are a superfamily of heme-containing enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of an extremely wide variety of substrates. Human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6)1 is one of the most important members of this family due to its central role in the metabolism of many drugs in common clinical use (1Jones B.C. Tyman C.A. Smith D.A. Xenobiotica. 1997; 27: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), such as opioids, antidepressants, neuroleptics, and various cardiac medications. CYP2D6 is polymorphic, giving rise to wide interindividual and ethnic differences in drug metabolism (2Mahgoub A. Idle J.R. Dring L.G. Lancaster R. Smith R.L. Lancet. 1977; 2: 584-586Abstract PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 3Eichelbaum M. Spannbrucker N. Steincke B. Dengler H.J. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Inheritance of the defective gene results in the “poor metabolizer” phenotype that results in impaired drug oxidation reactions (4Koymans L. Vermeulen N.P. van Acker S.A. te Koppele J.M.

P450-drug and drug-drug interactions involving CYP2D6 ligands are a prime consideration in the development of new drugs, emphasizing the importance of a detailed understanding of the factors that govern the substrate specificity of this enzyme. CYP2D6 substrates are structurally diverse, but several key structural features have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 7Ekins S. de Groot M.J. Jones J.P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 936-944PubMed Google Scholar). These include a basic nitrogen atom 5–10 Å from the site of metabolism that is present in the majority of CYP2D6 substrates, although it is far from being a universal requirement. For example, CYP2D6 can metabolizes progesterone (8Niwa T. Yabusaki Y. Honma K. Matsuo N. Tatsuta K. Ishibashi F. Katagiri M. Xenobiotica. 1998; 28: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and pregnenolone (9Hiroi T. Kishimoto W. Chow T. Imaoka S. Igarashi T. Funae Y. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and Guengerich et al.have recently described a spirosulphonamide as a high affinity substrate of CYP2D6, which lacks a basic nitrogen (10Guengerich F.P.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11025-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme can catalyze N-dealkylation reactions of substrates such as deprenyl (11Grace J.M. Kinter M.T. Macdonald T.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), amitriptyline (12Ghahramani P. Ellis S.W. Lennard M.S. Ramsay L.E. Tucker G.T. Br. J. Clin.

Dispos. 2001; 29: 1362-1365PubMed Google Scholar), a commonly used antitussive. An ionic interaction between a negatively charged carboxylate group in the active site of the enzyme and the basic nitrogen atom of substrates has been proposed to be the key determinant of the specificity of CYP2D6 reactions (16Islam S.A. Wolf C.R. Lennard M.S. Sternberg M.J. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A number of structural models have pointed to aspartate 301 in the I helix being the specific residue involved (4Koymans L. Vermeulen N.P. van Acker S.A. te Koppele J.M. Heykants J.J. Lavrijsen K.

This is supported by mutagenesis studies that showed that substitution of Asp-301 by neutral residues leads to a marked reduction in catalytic activity against “classical” CYP2D6 substrates (17Ellis S.W.

However, it is not clear if the carboxylate of this residue interacts directly with the basic nitrogen of the substrate within the active site as generally assumed, or whether it has a structural role, perhaps in the positioning of the B′-C loop in the active site (21Kirton S.B. Kemp C.A. Tomkinson N.P., St.- Gallay S. Sutcliffe M.J. Proteins. 2002; 49: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and is therefore an indirect determinant of substrate specificity (20Hanna I.H. Kim M.S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our recent modeling studies (21Kirton S.B. Kemp C.A. Tomkinson N.P., St.- Gallay S. Sutcliffe M.J.

We now report site directed mutagenesis studies of Glu-216 and Asp-301 aimed at clarifying their respective roles in CYP2D6 substrate specificity and regiospecificity. Terrific Broth (TB; 12g/liter bacto-tryptone, 24g/liter bacto-yeast extract, and 4ml/liter glycerol), chloramphenicol, δ-aminolevulinic acid, dithiothreitol, glucose 6-phosphate, NADP+, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium dithionite, cytochrome c, dextromethorphan, diclofenac, tolbutamide, nifedipine, and testosterone were all purchased from Sigma. Ampicillin was obtained from Beecham Research (Welwyn Garden City, UK), and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, UK). Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (type VII) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HPLC grade solvents were purchased from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, UK), and HPLC columns from Agilent (Crawford Scientific, UK). DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen and Promega. Dextrorphan, 3-methoxymorphinan, 6β-hydroxy-testosterone, bufuralol, 1′-hydroxy bufuralol, nifedipineN-oxide, hydroxy-tolbutamide, and 4′-hydroxydiclofenac were purchased from Ultra Fine Chemicals (Manchester, UK).

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 342-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the single-stranded DNA template method (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) using pB81 as a template, the dut-ung-E. coli strain CJ236, and the mutating oligonucleotide.

Note, all oligonucleotides are reverse complement sequences and written in the direction 3′ to 5′. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Expression was carried out essentially as previously described (25Pritchard M.P. Ossetian R., Li, D.N. Henderson C.J. Burchell B. Wolf C.R. Friedberg T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 342-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, pB81 and pB81-mutant plasmids were co-transfected with pJR7 into the E. coli strain JM109. Cultures were grown in TB at 30 °C until the A 600 reached >0.8, whereupon the heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Induction was initiated with the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cultures were grown until the appearance of P450 in the CO reduced spectra of whole cells (usually 24 h), at which point cells were harvested. Sphaeroplasts were prepared and sonicated, and the membrane fraction pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. Membranes were resuspended in TSE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose, 10% glycerol), and the P450 content determined by P450(Fe2+)-CO versus P450(Fe2+) difference spectra. P450 reductase activity was estimated by NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reduction (27Strobel H.W. Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Membranes were stored at −70 °C until required. All reactions were carried out in triplicate at 37 °C with shaking. HPLC analysis was carried out using a Hewlett Packard 1100 HPLC and Chemstation software. Reactions were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0–800 μmbufuralol, 10 pmol P450, and an NADPH-generating system (5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 mm NADP+) in a total volume of 300 μl. After 3 min of pre-incubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated with the addition of the NADPH-generating system and incubated for a further 6 min before stopping with 15 μl of 60% perchloric acid. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min to remove particulate material. Routinely, 100-μl aliquots of the reaction supernatant were injected onto HPLC. Metabolites were separated using a Hypersil ODS column (5 μm; 125 × 4.0 mm), flow rate, 1.0 ml/min. A step gradient was applied using 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5 (Buffer A) and acetonitrile (Buffer B). The gradient profile was 0 min = 73% A:27% B; 11.3 min = 60% A:40% B; 12.3min = 49% A:51% B; and 13.3 min = 73% A:27% B (all v/v). The fluorescent metabolite 1′-hydroxy bufuralol was detected using λex = 252; λem = 302 and quantitated with reference to an authentic standard. Assays were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0–2000 μm dextromethorphan (for K mdetermination), or 100 μm dextromethorphan (for the regioselectivity studies), 10 pmol P450, and an NADPH-generating system in a total volume of 200 μl. After a 3-min pre-incubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of the NADPH-generating system and were incubated a further 6 min before stopping with 100 μl of ice-cold methanol and 5 μl of 60% perchloric acid. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation to remove particulate material. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using a Hypersil C18 BDS column (5 μm; 250 × 4.6 mm) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Isocratic separation was used with mobile phases of 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5, and acetonitrile mixed at ratios of 78%:22% (v/v) respectively for the separation of dextrorphan and 68%:32% (v/v) for 3-methoxymorphinan. Metabolites were detected by fluorescence (λex = 270; λem = 312) and quantitated with reference to authentic standards. Assays were carried out in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 400 μm testosterone, 30 pmol P450, and an NADPH-generating system in a total volume of 200 μl. After a 3-min pre-incubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of the NADPH-generating system and incubated for 3 h before stopping with 100 μl of ice-cold methanol and 5 μl of 60% perchloric acid. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation to remove particulate material. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using a Hypersil ODS (5 μm; 250 × 4.6 mm) column with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Step gradient separation using acetonitrile (Buffer A), water (Buffer B), and methanol (Buffer C) was used. The gradient profile was: 0 min = 2.5% A:45% B:52.5% C; 8 min = 2.5% A:25% B:72.5% C; 11.5 min = 2.5% A:45% B:52.5% C (all v/v/v). The run was terminated after 15 min. Products were detected at 240 nm and quantified with respect to an authentic 6β-hydroxytestosterone standard. Assays were carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 μm diclofenac (for the specific activity determination) or 0–750 μmdiclofenac (for kinetic analysis of the double mutant), 10 pmol P450, and an NADPH-generating system in a total volume of 200 μl. Following a 3-min pre-incubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of the NADPH-generating system and incubated for 90 min (for specific activities) or 4 min (for kinetics) before termination by the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold methanol. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation to remove particulate material. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using a Hypersil ODS column (5 μm; 250 × 4.6 mm) run isocratically at 1 ml/min with mobile phase of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, and acetonitrile (77%:23% (v/v), respectively) and detected at 280 nm. 4′-Hydroxy diclofenac formation was quantified using an authentic standard. A minor peak corresponding to a 5′-hydroxy metabolite was seen in some cases but not quantified. Assays were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0–2000 μm tolbutamide, 10 pmol P450, and an NADPH-generating system in a total volume of 250 μl. Following a 3-min pre-incubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of the NADPH-generating system and incubated for 6 min before termination by the addition of 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation to remove particulate material. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using a Hypersil ODS column (5 μm; 250 × 4.6 mm). Step gradient separation using acetonitrile (Buffer A), 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.3, (Buffer B) was used. The gradient profile was: 0 min = 32% A:68% B; 11.5 min = 49% A:51% B; 12.5 min = 32% A:68% B (all v/v), and the metabolite was detected at 230 nm. Tolbutamide 4-methylhydroxylation formation was quantitated using an authentic standard. Reactions were carried out in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.85, 0–1000 μmnifedipine, 10 pmol P450, and an NADPH-generating system in a total volume of 200 μl. After a 3-min pre-incubation at 37 °C, reactions were started by the addition of the NADPH-generating system, and samples were incubated for 10 min before stopping with 100 μl of ice-cold methanol. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min to remove particulate material. Aliquots of the supernatant were injected onto HPLC. Metabolites were separated using a Hypersil ODS column (5 μm; 125 × 4.0 mm) and run isocratically at 1.0 ml/min using a mobile phase of water:methanol:acetonitrile (45:25:30) (v/v/v). The oxidized nifedipine metabolite was detected at 254 nm and quantitated with reference to an authentic standard. The models of CYP2D6 were produced, and the dockings of substrates performed as described previously (21Kirton S.B. Kemp C.A. Tomkinson N.P., St.- Gallay S. Sutcliffe M.J. Proteins. 2002; 49: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, the models of CYP2D6 were produced using comparative modeling (Modeler; Ref. 28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10447) Google Scholar) with five structural templates—P450s cam, terp, eryF, BM3, and 2C5. The substrates were then docked into the active site of CYP2D6 using GOLD (29Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5291) Google Scholar). A series of CYP2D6 mutants were constructed in which the acidic amino acid residues Glu-216 or Asp-301 were replaced with acidic, basic, and uncharged residues. Additionally both charged residues were neutralized in the double mutant E216Q/D310Q. Levels of expression of the mutant P450s ranged from 150–645 nmol/liter E. coli culture compared with 300 nmol/liter for wild type CYP2D6. P450 reductase levels ranged between 289 and 467 nmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/mg of E. coli membrane. The D301A mutant failed to form spectroscopically detectable P450, and the D301N mutant was found to be less stable than the other mutant isoforms in the presence of sodium dithionite during P450(Fe2+)-CO versus P450(Fe2+) difference spectroscopy. Thus, mutations to the Asp-301 residue generally had a destabilizing effect on the enzyme, in agreement with previous findings (20Hanna I.H. Kim M.S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis was carried out on the mutant P450s co-expressed in E. coli with human cytochrome P450 reductase using bufuralol and dextromethorphan, two prototypical CYP2D6 substrates that each contain a basic nitrogen (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameters for bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation and dextromethorphanO-demethylation are shown in TableI. Conservative replacements of Glu-216 or Asp-301 with Asp and Glu, respectively, produced small (2–6-fold) increases in K m values and had negligible effects onk cat for both substrates. However, replacement of either of the negatively charged side chains with a neutral group had much larger effects, particularly on the K mvalues.Table IKinetic parameters for bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylationCYP2D6Bufuralol 1′-hydroxylationDextromethorphanO-demethylationK Mk catK Mk catμmmin −1μmmin −1Wild type1.1 ± 0.042.1 ± 0.012.6 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.04E216D6 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.0213 ± 12.2 ± 0.04E216Q188 ± 53.1 ± 0.0351 ± 30.4 ± 0.01E216A162 ± 53.6 ± 0.0463 ± 111.3 ± 0.06E216F117 ± 53.0 ± 0.0430 ± 30.9 ± 0.03E216K187 ± 73.3 ± 0.05312 ± 240.2 ± 0.01D301E2.0 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.0211 ± 11.4 ± 0.05D301N160 ± 62.0 ± 0.033598 ± 1663.5 ± 0.06D301Q142 ± 63.2 ± 0.04200 ± 101.4 ± 0.03E216Q/D301Q522 ± 291.4 ± 0.03438 ± 497.6 ± 0.53Assays were performed in triplicate as described under Materials and Methods.

The error values shown are the standard deviations calculated from fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data. Substitution of Asp-301 by asparagine or glutamine led to a 130- to 145-fold increase in K m values for bufuralol; for dextromethorphan, the increase was 80-fold with the D301Q mutant but as much as 1400-fold for D301N. For both substrates, the effects onk cat were modest, ranging from a 30% decrease to a 70% increase. The role of Glu-216 has not hitherto been established experimentally. Substitution of this residue by glutamine, alanine, or phenylalanine had rather similar effects to the Asp-301 substitution as far as bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation is concerned; K m was increased by 100- to 170-fold, and k catincreased by 40–70%, there being little effect of the bulk of the neutral side chain at this position. For dextromethorphanO-demethylation, the effects on K m were smaller (10–25-fold increase), but k cat was decreased by as much as 5-fold in the E216Q mutant. Substitution of both acidic residues by glutamine in E216Q/D301Q led to larger increases in K m values for both bufuralol and dextromethorphan than observed for the individual substitutions. However, the effects on the k cat values were quite different. Both the individual E216Q and D301Q substitutions led to an ∼50% increase in k cat for bufuralol, but the double mutant showed a 40% decrease ink cat relative to the wild type (less than half the rate of either individual mutant). An analogous effect but in the opposite direction was seen for dextromethorphan, where the individual substitutions lead to a decrease in k cat by as much as 5-fold, while the double mutant shows an ∼4-fold increase. A clear difference between the two substrates is also seen in the effects of replacing the negative charge at position 216 by a positive charge in the E216K mutant. Such a mutation might be expected to show the largest reduction in binding affinity for nitrogenous substrates through repulsion of the basic nitrogen atom by the positive side chain. For bufuralol, this mutant shows kinetic constants indistinguishable from those of the neutral E216Q mutant. For dextromethorphan, by contrast, there is a much greater increase inK m values (120-fold as opposed to 11-fold) and a greater decrease in k cat values (10-foldversus 5-fold). Dextromethorphan, the more rigid substrate experiences a larger differential effect. To gain further information on the effect of mutations on the positioning of substrate in the active site, changes in the ratios of dextromethorphan metabolites were analyzed. The major pathway of dextromethorphan metabolism by CYP2D6 is O-demethylation, with the formation of dextrorphan. However, CYP2D6 can also catalyze demethylation at the basic nitrogen to produce 3-methoxymorphinan (3MM) in a concentration-dependent manner (15Yu A. Dong H. Lang D. Haining R.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1362-1365PubMed Google Scholar). To probe any changes in regioselectivity produced by the mutations, the ratio of the two activities was measured at 0.1 mm dextromethorphan. The wild type enzyme and the conservative mutants E216D and D301E produced similar dextrorphan/3MM ratios of ∼8:1, indicating a strong preference for the O-demethylation pathway (Fig. 3). However, this ratio was substantially decreased following removal of either of the negative charges, consistent with a decreased preference for binding the basic nitrogen close to Glu-216 and Asp-301, distant from the heme iron. Dextrorphan:3MM ratios as low as 1:1 were observed, for the E216F, E216K, D301N, D301Q, and E216Q/D301Q mutants. If the interaction of the two acidic residues of CYP2D6 with the substrate is a key determinant of the substrate specificity of the enzyme, specifically of its preference for substrates containing a basic nitrogen, the mutants in which one or both of these residues have been mutated might be expected to show a broader substrate specificity. As an initial test of this, we measured the ability of the mutants to oxidize two atypical CYP2D6 substrates lacking a basic nitrogen. The compounds used were testosterone (uncharged; a CYP3A4 substrate) and diclofenac (negatively charged; a CYP2C9 substrate) (Fig. 2). Measured rates of formation of 6β-hydroxytestosterone and 4′-hydroxy diclofenac, the products formed from these substrates by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, respectively, are shown in Table II.Table IISpecific activities of E. coli membranes expressing wild type and mutant CYP2D6 for testosterone and diclofenacMutantCatalytic activity2-aAssays were analysed as described under “Materials and Methods,” using substrate concentrations of 400 μm for testosterone and 500 μm for diclofenac.

Our previous work searching EST databases for proteins containing the C-terminal KDEL motif predicted some novel murine proteins, one of which designated JPDI (J-domain-containing proteindisulfide isomerase-like protein) is characterized in this study. The primary structure of JPDI is unique, because in addition to a J-domain motif adjacent to the N-terminal translocation signal sequence, four thioredoxin-like motifs were found in a single polypeptide. As examined by Northern blotting, the expression of JPDI was essentially ubiquitous in tissues and almost independent of ER stress. A computational prediction that JPDI is an ER-resident luminal protein was experimentally supported by immunofluorescent staining of epitope-tagged JPDI-expressing cells together with glycosylation and protease protection studies of this protein. JPDI probably acts as a DnaJ-like partner of BiP, because a recombinant protein carrying the J-domain of JPDI associated with BiP in an ATP-dependent manner and enhanced its ATPase activity. We speculate that for the folding of some proteins in the ER, chaperoning by BiP and formation of proper disulfide bonds may synchronously occur in a JPDI-dependent manner.

We speculate that for the folding of some proteins in the ER, chaperoning by BiP and formation of proper disulfide bonds may synchronously occur in a JPDI-dependent manner. Most eukaryotic membrane or secretory proteins are thought to be folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; JPDI,J-domain-containing PDI-like protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; HA, hemagglutinin; JPDI-HA, HA-tagged JPDI; EndoH, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GST-J, a fusion of GST-JPDI J-domain (His)6 tag; Trx-100, Triton X-100; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Glycosylation and disulfide bond formation are involved in the correct folding of these proteins because inhibition of such post-translational modifications causes accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. As described below, various molecular chaperones and folding enzymes located in the ER play crucial roles in these cellular events (1Stevens F.J. Argon Y. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). BiP, also known as GRP78, is an ER-resident member of the Hsp70 chaperone family. As reviewed by Gething (2Gething M.-J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), it is apparent that in the ER, many unfolded proteins are chaperoned by BiP. Through the maintenance of solubility by BiP, unfolded proteins are occasionally subjected to ER-associated degradation (3Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 4Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B. McCracken A.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Furthermore, translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the ER requires BiP, and it seems that BiP plays multiple roles in the protein translocation machinery (6Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E.

Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition, Ire1 and PERK, sensors for accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, are negatively regulated by BiP (9Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 10Okamura K. Kimata Y. Higashio H. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Similar to other Hsp70 family chaperones, BiP carries an N-terminal ATPase domain and an adjacent substrate-binding domain. The biochemical properties of these domains in Hsp70 family chaperones are well documented (11Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). ATP binding to the ATPase domain causes low affinity but rapid binding of chaperone substrates to the substrate-binding domain, whereas subsequent ATP hydrolysis stabilizes substrate binding. ATPase activity of Hsp70 family chaperones is regulated by various co-chaperones, including J-proteins (11Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 12Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The defining feature of J-proteins is an ∼70-amino acid-residue signature termed the J-domain. Through this domain, J-proteins interact with their Hsp70 chaperone partners to stimulate ATP hydrolysis. Up until now, several types of ER-resident J-proteins have been identified. Over the full-length of the molecules, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeScj1 and mammalian HEDJ (13Yu M. Haslam R.H. Haslam D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24984-24992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) share common structural features with bacterial DnaJ, which has an intrinsic ability to bind some unfolded proteins and assists in chaperoning by its Hsp70 partner DnaK (11Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 14Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. Gething M.-J. Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 95-98Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated experimentally that Scj1 and another J-protein, Jem1, act to chaperone unfolded proteins in the yeast ER (5Nishikawa S.I. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,15Silberstein S. Schlenstedt G. Silver P.A. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, yeast Sec63 (16Brodsky J.L. Gething M.-J. Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 108-110Google Scholar), its putative mammalian orthologue hSec63 (17Skowronek M.H. Rotter M. Haas I.G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and mammalian MTJ1 (18Chevalier M. Rhee H. Elguindi E.C. Blond S.Y. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2958-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), all of which are transmembrane J-proteins, seem to be directly involved in protein translocation across the ER membrane. Their similarity to bacterial DnaJ is restricted to the J-domain. In addition, mammalian cells contain a fourth ER-resident J-protein termed ERdj4 (20Shen Y. Meunier L. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15947-15956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Another distinct family of ER-resident proteins, of which protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is best documented (21Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), is defined by the presence of thioredoxin-like motifs in their primary structure. PDI promotes oxidative folding of secretory proteins through catalyzing thiol-disulfide exchange reactions including disulfide formation, disulfide reduction, and disulfide isomerization. In this case, the thioredoxin-like motifs act as the catalytic active centers of PDI (23Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is widely accepted that PDI acts not only as an enzyme but also as a chaperone, and in this case, Tsai et al. (24Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) proposed that the thioredoxin-like motifs play a regulatory role. BiP, PDI, and several other soluble proteins resident in the ER carry a conserved tetrapeptide sequence, KDEL, at their C terminus (25Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). This KDEL motif and its variants are termed the ER retrieval signal, and it is commonly accepted that proteins carrying this signal are bound by a receptor in the Golgi apparatus and that the receptor-ligand complex returns to the ER (26Pelham H.R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We previously searched EST databases for proteins carrying this C-terminal KDEL motif (27Kimata Y. Ooboki K. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Hosoda A. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This data base search predicted some novel proteins, one of which was named EP58 and is characterized in our previous report (27Kimata Y. Ooboki K. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Hosoda A. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here we describe studies on another protein, JPDI (J-domain-containingPDI-like protein), which is a new type of ER-resident J-protein carrying thioredoxin-like motifs. As described previously (27Kimata Y. Ooboki K. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Hosoda A. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), murine total RNA was subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCR using an oligo(dT) primer for the reverse transcription. For the PCR, the primer set 5′-CCGGAATT CCACCATGGGAGTCTGGTTAAAGATGAC-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCGATCTTCTGATGCCGTTCTCC-3′ was employed. Both primers are specific to the predicted sequence of JPDI with the exception of additional EcoRI sites (italics) plus CCG and a Kozak sequence (underlined) (28Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). The resulting reverse transcriptase-PCR product carrying the JPDI cDNA was digested by EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) to obtain plasmid pJPDI-1. The JPDI cDNA in pJPDI-1 was modified by insertion of a DNA sequence encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (29Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pCAG-JPDI-HA, was used for mammalian expression of JPDI tagged with a HA epitope tag at a position just N-terminally adjacent to the C-terminal KDEL (JPDI-HA) (see Fig. 1 A). The J-domain-encoding sequence was PCR-amplified from pJPDI-1 using the primer set 5′-CGCGGATCCGAACAGATCAGAATTTTTACAGTTTACTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAATGGTGGTGATGATGGTGGATGAAGAGGCTGGGGTAGC-3′. Both are specific to JPDI with the exception of additionalBamHI and EcoRI sites (italics) plus CGC or CCG and a (His)6 tag-encoding sequence (underlined). After digestion with BamHI andEcoRI, the PCR product was cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescript II KS+. The J-domain-encoding fragment was re-excised from the resulting plasmid by BamH I/XhoI digestion and inserted into the corresponding sites of a bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain plasmid pGEX-J. Plasmid pGEX-J(H63Q) is identical to pGEX-J except that it carries a mutant version of the J-domain-encoding sequence -AGTTACAGCCTGATAA- (the mutated nucleotide residue is underlined). All of the mammalian cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (ICN) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfection of plasmids was performed as described previously (30Iwawaki T. Hosoda A. Okuda T. Kamigori Y. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As probes for Northern blot analysis, the following cDNA fragments were random primer-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP: murine JPDI and murine BiP (entire coding region); human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (+75 to +1019); and human β-actin. Mouse multi-tissue Northern blot was purchased from Clontech. Extraction of total RNA from cultured cells and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (30Iwawaki T. Hosoda A. Okuda T. Kamigori Y. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). After hybridization, blots were washed in 2× SSC at 65 °C and exposed to BAS imaging plate (Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan). 36 h post-transfection of pCAG-JPDI-HA, HeLa cells were lysed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After denaturing of proteins by incubation in 0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min, the lysates were treated with 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (EndoH) (a MBP-tagged version commercially called EndoHf, New England BioLabs), and 5 units/1 μg of lysate protein at 37 °C. Isolation of microsomes and protease protection assays were performed as described previously (27Kimata Y. Ooboki K. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Hosoda A. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with the exception that proteinase K was used at 1 μg/ml. In both EndoH treatment and protease protection assays, the resulting samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using the following materials: 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim, Tokyo, Japan) and rabbit anti-human BiP antibody as primary antibodies; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgGs (Dako) and anti-rabbit IgGs (AmershamBiosciences) as secondary antibodies; and ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescent staining of cultured cells was performed as described previously (30Iwawaki T. Hosoda A. Okuda T. Kamigori Y. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). N-terminal GST and C-terminal (His)6 double-tagged JPDI J-domain and its H63Q mutant version (designated GST-J and GST-J(H63Q), respectively) were expressed from pGEX-J and pGEX-J(H63Q), respectively. Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) cells transformed with these plasmids were cultured in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to A 600 1.2. The cultures were then shifted to 20 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (final concentration, 0.1 mm). After further culture for 80 min, cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were then lysed by the addition of Triton X-100 (Trx-100, final concentration of 1%) and sonication. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation twice (9,500 × g for 20 min and 100,000 × gfor 30 min) and then loaded into a 1-ml bed of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 5 ml of lysis buffer, 10 ml of wash buffer A (lysis buffer plus 1 m KCl and 0.1% Trx-100), and 5 ml of wash buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm ATP, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 200 mm KOAc used to remove contaminating DnaK). Bound proteins were eluted with 8 ml of elution buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, 20 mm reduced glutathione (pH 8.0)) and loaded into a 0.5-ml bed of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer A (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)). The column was washed with wash buffer C (50 mm NaH2PO4, 1m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)), and bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer B (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)). Peak fractions were then pooled and dialyzed against buffer 88lK (20 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 75 mm KOAc, 250 mm sorbitol, 5 mmMg(OAc)2, 10% glycerol). Unfused GST was obtained from pGEX-5X-2 in E. coliBL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL by culturing cells in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h and purified using the above mentioned glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography and MonoQ (AmershamBiosciences) column chromatography, subsequently. The peak fractions were then pooled and dialyzed against buffer 88lK. An E. coli strain expressing (His)6-tagged hamster BiP not containing the translocation signal sequence was a kind gift of Dr. L. M. Hendershot (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The recombinant BiP protein was purified as described previously (31Wei J. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26670-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against buffer B88 (the same composition as buffer 88lK with the exception of 150 mmKOAc). Purified proteins (GST-J, GST-J(H63Q), and unfused GST) were adjusted to the same concentrations with buffer 88lK. 3 μg of each protein then was diluted to 80 μl with binding buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 6.8)), and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose equilibrated with binding buffer B was added. After incubation by rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × gand washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer B. The protein-bound beads were incubated with 2 μg of BiP in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer B containing 0 or 1 mm ATP for a 2-h rotation at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer B. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and detected by CBB staining of the gel. ATPase activity of BiP was monitored as described previously (32Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 1 μg of BiP was mixed with GST-J, GST-J(H63Q), or unfused GST in 100 μl of ATPase assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.8), 100 μmunlabeled ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Institute of Isotopes, Budapest, Hungary). [K+] was adjusted to 20 mm with KCl in each reaction. After reaction at 25 °C, SDS was added to 1%, and 0.5 μl of the resulting reaction mixture was developed on a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer plate (Sigma) with 0.5 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl to detect released inorganic 32P by BAS imaging. We previously searched the GenBankTM data base for DNA sequences corresponding to KDELter where “ter” means a stop codon, and among the resulting hits, we have focused on a EST sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AA062302) in this study. Using this EST sequence as the query, a subsequent BLAST search against the GenBankTMdata base predicted that it is part of a cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AK004617). This cDNA, which was generated and identified in the mouse full-length cDNA encyclopedia project (33Kawai J. Shinagawa A. Shibata K. Yoshino M. Itoh M. Ishii Y. Arakawa T. Hara A. Fukunishi Y.

Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), encodes a previously uncharacterized 793-amino acid-residue protein termed here as JPDI. Computational analyses using PSORT II (psort.nibb.ac.jp/form2.html) and Searching Motif (www.motif.genome.ad.jp/) programs indicated as shown in Fig. 1, A and B, that JPDI contains several significant sequence features together with the C-terminal KDEL motif. First, JPDI putatively bears an N-terminal translocation signal sequence that is cleaved between Gly-31 and Thr-32. The predicted molecular mass of signal sequence-cleaved JPDI is calculated as ∼87 kDa, which well coincides with endoglycosidase-treated HA-tagged JPDI from cell lysate (Fig. 3 B) as described below. Second, a 66-amino acid-residue J-domain motif was found adjacent to the translocation signal sequence. Finally, similar to PDI, JPDI contains multiple thioredoxin-like motifs (-WCXXC-). As shown in Fig. 1 C, translating the BLAST search against the GenBankTM data base using the JPDI amino acid sequence as the query predicted similar uncharacterized proteins in humans (90% identical) and in Caenorhabditis elegans (37% identical). These putative orthologues of murine JPDI commonly carry all of the above mentioned sequence features. No homologue was found in S. cerevisiae. To determine the tissue distribution of JPDI expression, Northern blot detection of JPDI mRNA was performed using multi-tissue Northern blot, a commercial Northern blot membrane on which mouse poly(A)+ RNA preparations from various tissues were blotted. The JPDI probe almost ubiquitously detected duplicate bands (4.0 and 3.3 kilobases) in all of the tissues examined (Fig. 2 A). The 4.0-kilobase transcript was major in most of the tissues with the exception that the 3.3-kilobase transcript was highly expressed in the testis. Relatively speaking, JPDI expression was high in heart, liver, kidney, and testis and low in spleen and skeletal muscle. Several mammalian ER-resident chaperones and folding enzymes including BiP and PDI are transcriptionally induced by ER stress through intracellular signaling pathways as described previously (34Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the expression of JPDI is induced under ER stress conditions, NIH3T3 cells were treated with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin, an N-glycosylation inhibitor, or thapsigargin, a calcium pump inhibitor. Thereafter, total RNA preparations were analyzed by Northern blotting, which showed that JPDI mRNA was only slightly induced (∼1.3-fold) under conditions in which BiP mRNA was induced ∼10-fold (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar results were obtained using L tk− cells (data not shown). Unlike the result in multi-tissue Northern blot, only the 3.3-kilobase transcript was detected in these cultured cells. JPDI carries only one significant hydrophobic segment, which is positioned at the N terminus and predicted to be a cleavable translocation signal, on the basis of its amino acid sequence. Because of this sequence feature and the C-terminal KDEL motif, JPDI seemed to be an ER-resident luminal protein. Therefore, we undertook the task of confirming this idea experimentally by using cultured cells transiently expressing JPDI tagged with a HA tag at the position just N-terminally adjacent to the C-terminal KDEL motif (hereafter called JPDI-HA) (see Fig. 1 A). First, JPDI-HA-expressing NIH3T3 cells were doubly immunostained with anti-HA antibody and anti-PDI antibody. As detected by fluorescence microscopy, both JPDI-HA staining and PDI staining yielded classical ER patterns (Fig. 3 A,upper and middle panels). The yellow/orange color in the overlay image indicates co-localization of JPDI-HA and PDI (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Similar images were obtained from JPDI-HA-expressing HeLa and COS7 cells. Lysates of JPDI-HA-expressing HeLa cells were treated next with EndoH and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot detection of JPDI-HA. As shown in Fig. 3 B, EndoH treatment increased the mobility of JPDI in SDS-PAGE. This result indicates that JPDI is modified by N-linked glycosylation that is cleavable by EndoH. Finally, microsomes prepared from JPDI-HA-expressing HeLa cells were treated with proteinase K, and proteins protected from protease digestion were detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 C, neither JPDI-HA nor BiP was digested unless the microsomal membrane was lysed by detergent Trx-100. The localization of JPDI to the ER implies that JPDI may act as a DnaJ-like partner of BiP. This possibility was tested by experiments designed to observe in vitro interaction of the JPDI J-domain with BiP. At the beginning of in vitro analyses, a fusion of GST-JPDI J-domain (His)6 tag named GST-J was expressed in bacteria and purified by glutathione affinity and subsequent nickel-chelating chromatography. As monitored by CBB staining after SDS-PAGE separation, contaminating protein was virtually undetectable in the purified preparation of GST-J (Fig. 4 A). A tripeptide motif, HPD, in the J-domain is quite highly conserved among J-proteins. As initially demonstrated using E. coliDnaJ (35Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an amino acid replacement of the HPD motif to QPD causes a complete loss of J-domain functions. In murine JPDI, the amino acid residues positioned at 63–65 correspond to this motif (see Fig. 1 A). Thus, as a negative control in the following experiments, we generated GST-J(H63Q), a mutant version of GST-J where the HPD motif is replaced by QPD (see Fig. 1 A). An unfused version of GST (hereafter called GST) was also employed as another type of negative control. Similar to GST-J, CBB staining after SDS-PAGE separation confirmed that GST-J, GST, and BiP were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 4 A). For a pull-down experiment to test J-domain binding to BiP, glutathione-Sepharose beads carrying GST-J, GST-J(H63Q), or GST were incubated with BiP in the absence or presence of ATP. The subsequent analysis of pulled-down proteins showed that BiP does not bind with GST-J(H63Q) or GST but it does with GST-J and that this binding requires ATP (Fig. 4 B). It is well known that the ATPase activity of Hsp70 family chaperones is enhanced by the J-domain of their specific J-protein partners. Thus, we next asked whether the J-domain of JPDI stimulates in vitroATP hydrolysis by BiP. First, 1 μg of BiP was incubated without additional protein or with 0.5 μg each of GST, GST-J, or GST-J(H63Q) in ATPase assay buffer (the molar ratio of BiP to GST-J or GST-J(H63Q) was 1.4). The results shown in Fig. 5,A and B, indicate that GST and GST-J(H63Q) had little or no ability to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by BiP and that, on the contrary, ATPase activity of BiP was enhanced ∼2-fold by the addition of GST-J. This ATP hydrolysis assay was performed next using various concentrations of GST, GST-J, or GST-J(H63Q), which confirmed that only GST-J stimulates ATP hydrolysis by BiP (Fig. 5 C). Our computational search for proteins bearing a C-terminal ER retrieval signal predicted a novel murine protein, JPDI. Remarkably, JPDI is the first identified protein carrying both a J-domain and thioredoxin-like motifs in a single polypeptide chain (Fig. 1). Because the similarity of JPDI to other J-proteins is restricted to the J-domain, we suspect that JPDI plays a role(s) quite different from that of other J-proteins. According to a further computational data base search, humans andC. elegans carry putative orthologues of murine JPDI. The expression of JPDI mRNA was nearly ubiquitous in all the tissues examined, and ER stressors induced JPDI mRNA expression only very slightly (Fig. 2). These observations imply that JPDI may have stress-independent and constitutive function(s) commonly required in metazoan cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, two different sizes of JPDI mRNA were detected in various murine tissues. We suspect that these transcripts were produced by alternative termination or by alternative splicing at the 3′-untranslated region, because a 3′-RACE analysis predicted multiple 3′-untranslated region lengths of JPDI mRNA (data not shown). We next experimentally confirmed cellular localization of JPDI to the ER lumen using mammalian cultured cells transiently expressing an HA epitope-tagged version of JPDI designated here as JPDI-HA. To avoid dysfunction of the N-terminal translocation signal sequence and the C-terminal KDEL motif of JPDI, the HA tag was added not at the N or C terminus but at the position indicated in Fig. 1 A. A SDS-PAGE mobility shift of JPDI-HA by EndoH digestion indicates theN-linked glycosylation and thus luminal localization of this protein (Fig. 3 B). We suspect that JPDI is glycosylated at the N-glycosylation motif NX(S/T) (see Fig. 1 A). Moreover, JPDI-HA in a microsomal fraction was protected from protease digestion (Fig. 3 C). This result strongly suggests luminal localization of the entire region of JPDI. Localization of JPDI to the ER was demonstrated by anti-HA immunofluorescent staining, which yielded an ER-like pattern almost overlapping that of anti-PDI staining (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the above mentioned susceptibility of JPDI-HA to EndoH digestion also implies the ER localization of JPDI, because, in general,N-linked glycosyl chains are modified such that they are not susceptible to EndoH digestion in the mammalian Golgi apparatus. Here we also presented two lines of in vitro evidence that JPDI can interact with BiP as its DnaJ-like partner via the J-domain. First, a GST pull-down assay indicated ATP-dependent binding of BiP to the JPDI J-domain (Fig. 4). A requirement for hydrolyzable ATP for the J-protein-Hsp70 chaperone interaction is well documented (32Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of BiP next was significantly enhanced by the JPDI J-domain (Fig. 5). The following observations indicate that our preparation of JPDI J-domain interacts with BiP as its functional partner rather than as an unfolded protein substrate, which also binds to Hsp70 chaperones to stimulate their ATPase activity (11Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). First, unlike the case for J-protein partners, the binding of unfolded protein substrates to Hsp70 chaperones is inhibited by ATP (36Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Second, amino acid replacement of the highly conserved HPD motif with QPD in the J-domain, which commonly causes dysfunction of various J-proteins (35Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), significantly decreased the ability of the JPDI J-domain to bind to BiP and to stimulate its ATPase activity (Figs. 4and 5). Considering the high degree of specificity of a J-domain for its Hsp70 chaperone partner (38Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it is likely that BiP is the natural Hsp70 chaperone partner of JPDI. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other ER-resident Hsp70 family proteins including GRP170 (39Lin H.Y. Masso-Welch P., Di, Y.P. Cai J.W. Shen J.W. Subjeck J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1109-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) interact with JPDI. Thus far, we have failed to demonstrate any PDI-like activities for JPDI, although the multiple thioredoxin-like motifs of JPDI imply its activity in disulfide formation. Heterologous expression of murine JPDI was not able to rescue the lethal phenotype of a PDI gene disruption inS. cerevisiae (data not shown). In our in vitroassay, oxidative refolding of denatured ribonuclease A was not promoted by JPDI, and we have not shown so far thiol-dependent reductase activity of recombinant JPDI, which catalyzes the reduction of insulin disulfides by dithiothreitol (data not shown). Nevertheless, if we suppose a disulfide isomerization activity of JPDI, it is possible to speculate that this reaction occurs synergistically with chaperoning by BiP. In this scenario, BiP may be recruited by the JPDI J-domain and bind unfolded protein substrates to maintain their form, thus making them accessible to the JPDI thioredoxin-like catalytic centers for disulfide isomerization. Cooperation between BiP and PDI was demonstrated in an in vitro refolding reaction of a denatured and reduced model protein (40Mayer M. Kies U. Kammermeier R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29421-29425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, another thioredoxin-like motif-containing ER-resident protein, ERp57, was proposed to function together with the lectin-like chaperones calnexin and calreticulin to promote glycoprotein folding (41Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 42Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The above mentioned hypothesized function of JPDI would be a novel example of synergy between a chaperone and a folding enzyme. An alternative hypothesis for JPDI function, which is also a speculation derived from the knowledge of PDI, is that JPDI acts to bind with unfolded proteins. If this idea is correct, it is possible that like bacterial DnaJ JPDI functions to bring unfolded proteins to its Hsp70 chaperone partner. In this case, the thioredoxin-like motifs may play a regulatory role in retrotranslocation from the ER to cytosol as hypothesized (24Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Otherwise, JPDI may somehow help the function of BiP in the protein translocation machinery. We anticipate that our further studies including the generation of JPDI-deficient cells will clarify the biochemical and physiological function(s) of JPDI. We thank Dr. Linda M.

To investigate the significance of the isoleucine-proline (residues 2427–2428) dipeptide epitope, which is thought to form an essential part of the FKBP12.6 binding site in RyR2, we generated single and double mutants, P2428Q, I2427E/P2428A, and P2428A/L2429E, expressed them in HEK293 cells, and assessed their ability to bind GST-FKBP12.6. None of these mutations abolished GST-FKBP12.6 binding, indicating that this isoleucine-proline motif is unlikely to form the core of the FKBP12.6 binding site in RyR2. To systematically define the molecular determinants of FKBP12.6 binding, we constructed a series of internal and NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants of RyR2 and examined the effect of these deletions on GST-FKBP12.6 binding.

Furthermore, an NH2-terminal fragment containing the first 1937 residues is sufficient for GST-FKBP12.6 binding. Co-expression of overlapping NH2 and COOH-terminal fragments covering the entire sequence of RyR2 produced functional channels but did not restore GST-FKBP12.6 binding.

They govern the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and play an essential role in various cellular processes including muscle contraction, fertilization, secretion, and apoptosis (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). These channels are regulated by a number of protein modulators, such as the 12- and 12.6-kDa FK506-binding proteins (FKBP12 and FKBP12.6) (2Meissner G. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar) reported that a 136-amino acid fragment of the human RyR2 containing residues 2361–2496 interacted with FKBP12.6 and that this interaction was inhibited by rapamycin, a drug known to dissociate FKBP12.6 from RyR2. Based on these observations, Marx et al. (14Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar) proposed that the FKBP12.6 binding site is defined by isoleucine 2427 and proline 2428, analogous to the FKBP12 binding motif in IP3Rs, RyR1, and RyR3. However, contradictory to this proposal and the observations by Marx et al. (14Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar), recent studies by Zissimopoulos and Lai (21Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 59Google Scholar) using the yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that of the 10 overlapping fragments covering the entire sequence of human RyR2, none interacted with FKBP12.6. Using the same assay, they were, however, able to observe interactions between the cytoplasmic domain of the type 1 tumor growth factor-β receptor and FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 (21Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 59Google Scholar). Zissimopoulos and Lai (21Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 59Google Scholar) also found that a large COOH-terminal fragment of human RyR2 encompassing all 10 transmembrane helices interacted with FKBP12.6, leading to the suggestion that the FKBP12.6 binding site is located at the COOH terminus of RyR2 (21Zissimopoulos S. Lai F.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 59Google Scholar). Therefore, the location of the FKBP12.6 binding site in RyR2 remains controversial and has yet to be defined. In the present study, we investigated the significance of the isoleucine-proline motif in FKBP12.6 interaction with RyR2. Using a GST-FKBP12.6 pull-down assay, we found that mutations of this motif did not prevent GST-FKBP12.6 from binding to RyR2, in contrast to observations with RyR1 and RyR3. This prompted us to conduct systematic studies to define the FKBP12.6 binding site in RyR2. Through internal, NH2-terminal, and COOH-terminal deletion analysis, we showed that the first 1937 NH2-terminal residues are sufficient for GST-FKBP12.6 binding, whereas the last ∼3000 COOH-terminal residues encompassing the proposed FKBP12.6 binding motif are neither required nor sufficient for GST-FKBP12.6 binding. In addition, we demonstrated that multiple regions within the NH2-terminal domain are required for GST-FKBP12.6 interaction. Furthermore, co-expression of overlapping NH2and COOH-terminal fragments led to the formation of functional RyR channels but did not reconstitute the GST-FKBP12.6 binding site. These observations suggest that FKBP12.6 binding may be conformation-dependent. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc.

Soybean phosphatidylcholine was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipid. CHAPS and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (22Chen S.R.W., Li, X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 18–20 h after subculture were transfected with 6–12 μg of wild type or mutant RyR cDNAs using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The point mutation, RyR2 (I4827T), was produced as described previously (24Xiao B. Masumiya H. Jiang D. Wang R. Sei Y. Zhang L. Murayama T. Ogawa Y. Lai F.A. Wagenknecht T. Chen S.R. J. Biol.

Mutations in the proposed FKBP12.6 binding motif, P2428Q, I2427E/P2428A, and P2428A/L2429E, were generated by the overlap extension method using PCR (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). A BamHI (7065)-HpaI (7581) fragment containing the single point mutation, P2428Q, or double mutations, I2427E/P2428A or P2428A/L2429E, was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the wild type EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment. The mutated EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment was subsequently ligated to the full-length mouse RyR2 cDNA. The “outer” primers used were 5′-GGTAATGGTCTCCTTGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTATGGAGTCCCGCTGA-3′ (reverse). The primers used for mutation P2428Q were 5′-ATCTCTAATTCAATTGGGAGACTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTCCCAATTGAATTAGAGATCGC-3′ (reverse). The primers used for mutations I2427E/P2428A were 5′-CGATCTCTGGAGGCATTGGGAGACTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCTCCCAATGCCTCCAGAGATCGCAA-3′ (reverse). The primers used for mutations P2428A/L2429E were 5′-TCTCTGATTGCAGAGGGAGACTTGGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAAGTCTCCCTCTGCAATCAGAGATCG-3′ (reverse). The full-length mouse RyR2 cDNA was digested with HpaI, and the HpaI (7581)-HpaI (14,304) fragment was discarded, whereas the remaining fragment was self-ligated to form the deletion mutant D2530–4770. To generate the deletion mutant D1636–4414, the RyR2 cDNA was digested with Bsu36I, theBsu36I (4900)-Bsu36I (13,237) fragment was discarded, and the remaining fragment self-ligated. The full-length RyR2 cDNA was digested with Bsu36I and HpaI, followed by Klenow treatment to blunt the digested DNA ends. The blunted RyR2 cDNA fragment containing the pcDNA3 plasmid was ligated with the HpaI (7581)-HpaI (14,304) fragment to form the D1636–2530 deletion mutant. The BamHI (7065)-HpaI (7581) fragment was removed form theEcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment by digestion with BamHI and HpaI, blunting with Klenow, and self-ligating. This modified EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment was then used to replace the corresponding fragment in the full length RyR2 to produce the deletion mutant D2358–2530. To construct the D2150–2358 deletion mutant, the BamHI (7065)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment was removed from the RyR2 cDNA, blunted with Klenow, and used to replace the EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment in the full-length RyR2 cDNA. A Bsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (introduced at position 5811) fragment was generated by PCR using primers 5′-GATCCTCTGCAGTTCATGTCCCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGATATCGTCTTGGAGTTTAGCTACAAAGTCA-3′ (reverse). ThisBsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (5811) fragment was used to replace the Bsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment in the full-length RyR2. The missing EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment was then added back to form the D1937–2150 deletion mutant. Similarly, to construct the D1636–1937 deletion mutant, a Bsu36I (introduced at 5811)-EcoRV (6439) fragment was produced by PCR using the primers 5′-TACCTGAGGACAACCAACGGTTCAGGTATAATGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCATCACTGTCTCATGCATCCC-3′ (reverse). This Bsu36I (5811)-EcoRV (6439) fragment was used to replace theBsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment in the full-length RyR2. The missing EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment was then added back. AKpnI-Bsu36I adaptor, formed by annealing two primers, 5′-CATAGACCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGGGTCTATGGTAC-3′ (reverse), was ligated with the KpnI (3823)-Bsu36I (13237) fragment containing the pcDNA3 vector. The missing Bsu36I (4900)-Bsu36I (13237) fragment was then added back to form the D1274–1636 deletion mutant. By the same approach, a XhoI-KpnI adaptor, formed by two primers, 5′-TCGAGAGCCGAGGATGGTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATCCTCGGCTC-3′ (reverse), was used to delete the XhoI (3216)-KpnI (3823) fragment in order to generate the deletion mutant D1072–1274; a ClaI-XhoI adaptor, formed by two primers, 5′-CGATGGCGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGAGGCGCCAT-3′ (reverse), was used to remove the ClaI (2350)-XhoI (3216) fragment to form the D784–1072 deletion mutant; and an AflII-ClaI adaptor, formed by two primers, 5′-TTAAGCCTCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGATGAGGC-3′ (reverse), was used to replace the AflII (915)-ClaI (2350) fragment to produce the deletion mutant D305–784. An NheI-AflII adaptor was generated by annealing two primers, 5′-CTAGCAGCGCGGAGCCATGGCTGATTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAGTAATCAGCCATGGCTCCGCGCTG-3′ (reverse). The full-length mouse RyR2 cDNA was digested with NheI and AflII. The NheI (vector)-AflII (915) fragment was discarded, and the remaining fragment was ligated with theNheI-AflII adaptor to form the NH2-terminal deletion mutant D305. Similarly, anNheI-ClaI adaptor, formed by two primers, 5′-CTAGCCGGAGCCATGGCTGATAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGATATCAGCCATGGCTCCGG-3′ (reverse) was used to replace theNheI (vector)-ClaI (2350) fragment in the full-length RyR2 cDNA to form the deletion mutant D784. In order to generate the D1072 NH2-terminal deletion mutant, anNheI-XhoI adaptor, formed by two primers, 5′-CTAGCCGGAGCCATGGCTGATGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGAGGCATCAGCCATGGCTCCGG-3′ (reverse), was used to replace theNheI (vector)-XhoI (8501) fragment. The missingXhoI (3216)-XhoI (8501) fragment was then added back. To obtain the D1636 NH2-terminal deletion mutant, anNheI-Bsu36I adaptor, formed by two primers, 5′-CTAGCCGGAGCCATGGCTGATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGGATCAGCCATGGCTCCGG-3′ (reverse), was used to replace theNheI (vector)-Bsu36I (13,237) fragment. The missing Bsu36I (4900)-Bsu36I (13,237) fragment was then added back. An NheI-EcoRV adaptor, formed by two primers, 5′-CTAGCCGGAGCCATGGCTGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATCAGCCATGGCTCCGG-3′ (reverse), was used to replace theNheI (vector)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment. The missing EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment was then added back, producing the D2150 NH2-terminal deletion mutant. TheBsiWI (8864)-NotI (vector) fragment in the pcDNA3 plasmid was digested with HpaI and ligated with a linker containing a stop codon, 5′-CTAGCTAG-3′. The BsiWI (8864)-NotI (vector) fragment containing the inserted stop linker was then used to replace the corresponding fragment in the full-length RyR2 cDNA to yield the 1–4770 COOH-terminal deletion mutant. Similarly, a stop linker, 5′-GTAGCTAC-3′ was inserted into theBsu36I (position 13,237) site after being cut and blunted by Klenow treatment to form the 1–4114 deletion mutant. A stop linker, 5′-TAGTGATCACTA-3′, was inserted into the SalI site (introduced at 11,821) after being cut and blunted by Klenow treatment to form the 1–3940 COOH-terminal deletion mutant. The 1–2958 COOH-terminal deletion mutant was constructed by inserting a stop linker, 5′-TAGTGATCACTA-3′, into the BsiwI (8864) site after being cut and blunted by Klenow treatment in the full-length RyR2 cDNA. An NheI (vector)-BsiWI (8864) fragment in pcDNA3 was digested with HpaI and ligated with a stop linker, 5′-CTAGCTAG-3′, yielding the 1–2531 COOH-terminal deletion mutant. Similarly, a stop linker, 5′-TAGTGATCACTA-3′, was inserted into the EcoRV (6439) site, forming the 1–2150 COOH-terminal deletion mutant. PCR was used to introduce a stop codon after residue 1937. The forward primer used is 5′-GATCCTCTGCAGTTCATGTCCCTC-3′. The reverse primer containing a stop codon followed by an EcoRV site is 5′-GATATCCTAGTCTTGGAGTTTAGCTACAA-3′ (1937-stop). TheBsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (introduced after the stop codon) PCR fragment was used to replace the Bsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment in the full-length RyR2 cDNA to yield the 1–1937 COOH-terminal deletion mutant. In order to produce the 1–1636 COOH-terminal deletion mutant, a stop linker, 5′-GTAGCTAC-3′, was inserted into the Bsu36I (4900) site after being cut and blunted by Klenow treatment. To construct the 1–1072 and 1–531 COOH-terminal deletion mutants, a stop linker, 5′-AGTGATCACT-3′, was inserted into the XhoI (3216) andEcoRI (1590) sites, respectively, after being cut and blunted by Klenow treatment. All point mutations and deletions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell lysates from 5–10 dishes (100 mm in diameter) of transfected HEK293 cells, prepared as described previously (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (30 μl) that was prewashed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, and 2.7 mm KCl) and prebound with 100 μg of GST-FKBP12.6 or protein G-Sepharose (30 μl) that was prewashed with PBS and prebound with 10 μg of anti-c-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 17–19 h. The glutathione-Sepharose and the protein G-Sepharose beads were washed with ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% soybean phosphatidylcholine, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) three times, each time for 10 min. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were solubilized by the addition of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli's sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) plus 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The solubilized proteins (20 μl) were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 45 mV for 18–20 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.01% SDS according to Towbin et al. (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder. The blocked membrane was incubated with the anti-c-Myc antibody and washed three times each time for 15 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. The membrane was then incubated with the secondary anti-mouse IgG (H & L) antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 30–40 min. After washing three times each time for 15 min, the bound antibodies were visualized by the alkaline phosphatase-mediated color reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as the substrates. Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in transfected HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3-AM as described previously (29Masumiya H., Li, P. Zhang L. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39727-39735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mutating the proline at position 1401 in IP3R into glutamine or alanine abolishes FKBP12 binding (19Cameron A.M. Nucifora F.C., Jr. Fung E.T. Livingston D.J. Aldape R.A. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27582-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To determine the significance of the equivalent proline in RyR2 to FKBP12.6 binding, we mutated proline 2428 to glutamine (P2428Q). As shown in Fig. 1, both the wild type RyR2 (RyR2 (wt)) and the P2428Q mutant were pulled down by GST-FKBP12.6 (lanes 1 and2) but not by GST (not shown), indicating that the P2428Q mutation does not abolish FKBP12.6 binding to RyR2, in contrast to observations with IP3R. It has also been shown that mutations of valine 2461 in RyR1 or valine 2327 in RyR3 abolish FKBP12 binding and that leucine 195 after the leucine-proline motif in the tumor growth factor-β receptor is critical for FKBP12 binding (10Bultynck G.

To assess the role of the corresponding RyR2 residues in FKBP12.6 interaction, we generated two double mutations, I2427E/P2428A and P2428A/L2429E. Both mutants were pulled down by GST-FKBP12.6 (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4) but not by GST (not shown). Like the WT RyR2-transfected cells, HEK293 cells transfected with mutants P2428Q, I2427E/P2428A, and P2428A/L2429E exhibited caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 1 C). These data demonstrate that the isoleucine-proline motif is not essential for the interaction of RyR2 with FKBP12.6, although the corresponding motif is critical for FKBP12 binding to RyR1, RyR3, IP3Rs, and the tumor growth factor-β receptor. To identify regions in RyR2 that are essential for FKBP12.6 binding, we carried out a systematic deletion analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, deletion of amino acid residues 2530–4770 (construct 2) did not remove GST-FKBP12.6 binding, whereas deletion of residues 1636–4414 (construct 3) did, suggesting that a region between 1636–2530 is required for FKBP12.6 binding. In line with this suggestion, deletion of this region (1636–2530, construct 4) also abolished GST-FKBP12.6 binding (Fig. 2 B). The region between residues 1636–2530 was divided into four subregions. Deletion of subregions 2358–2530 (construct 5), 2150–2358 (construct 6), or 1937–2150 (construct 7) did not eliminate FKBP12.6 binding. It should be noted that subregion 2358–2530 encompasses the isoleucine-proline motif, further indicating that this motif and its flanking regions are not required for FKBP12.6 binding, which is consistent with the results of single point mutations (Fig. 1). On the other hand, deletion of subregion 1636–1937 (construct 8) did abolish FKBP12.6 binding. The importance of regions that are NH2-terminal to residues 1636 in FKBP12.6 binding was assessed by further deletion studies. Deletion of regions 1274–1636 (construct 9), 1072–1274 (construct 10), 784–1072 (construct 11), or 305–784 (construct 12) eliminated or diminished FKBP12.6 binding. Thus, a large region between residues 305 and 1937 is required for FKBP12.6 binding to RyR2. The effects of these internal deletions on RyR2 channel function were assessed by measuring the caffeine response of HEK293 cells transfected with each deletion mutant. All deletions completely abolished caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, A, C,E, G, I, K, M,O, Q, S, and U), indicating that a large portion of the RyR2 sequence is required for activation by caffeine. To assess their ability to form heteromeric channels, we co-expressed deletion mutants with an RyR2 mutant, RyR2 (I4827T), in HEK293 cells and determined their caffeine responses. We have shown previously that HEK293 cells transfected with the RyR2 (I4827T) mutant exhibited no caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (24Xiao B. Masumiya H. Jiang D. Wang R. Sei Y. Zhang L. Murayama T.

ASM News. 1992; 58: 650-651Google Scholar). Medical uses of gold have been limited largely to prosthetics and antiarthritic Au(I)-thiolate drugs, although the basis of antiarthritic action has been unclear (3Kendrick M.J. May M.T. Plishka M.J. Robinson K.D. Burgess J. Metals in biological Systems. Ellis Horwood, London1992Google Scholar). In contrast, the biological requirements for copper are quite well understood. Mammalian systems require copper for many enzymes (4Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper.in: Frieden E. Biochemistry of the Elements. Platinum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar).

MerR acts as a dimer on the promoter of bacterial mercury resistance (mer) genes recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter in the process (11Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and it is activated by Hg(II) binding to 3 cysteine residues in a trigonal planar fashion (12Utschig L.M. Bryson J.W. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1995; 268: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CueR activates expression of the copA promoter (PcopA) upon addition of copper or silver, but not nickel, lead, cadmium, mercury, or zinc salts (8Stoyanov J.V. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Here we show that CueR activates the PcopA promoter in the presence of gold salts and that cysteine residues, equivalent to those in MerR, are required for activation by copper, silver, and gold. All experiments, other than the construction of mutants and some β-galactosidase assays, were carried out in E. coli strain TG1 (K-12, lac-pro supE thi hsdD5 [F′ traD36proA + B + lacIq lacZ M15]). E. coli WK6 Δ(lac-proAB)galEstrA [F′ lacIq lacZΔM15 proAB+] and its mutS215:Tn10variant were used for gapped duplex mutagenesis (13Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.J.

Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or M9 medium supplemented with casamino acids and thiamine (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1989Google Scholar). For metal induction assays, sodium chloride was omitted to avoid AgCl precipitation (called SLB and SM9 media). Antibiotics were used as described earlier (17Parkhill J. Lawley B. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Standard DNA manipulations were carried out as described elsewhere (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Alta Bioscience Ltd., University of Birmingham, by Invitrogen, or by MWG Biotech. Cloned PCR products were sequenced using an PE Applied Biosystems Big DyeTM sequencing kit according to the manufacturers' instructions and analyzed on an ABI 3700 sequencing apparatus. E. coli cells transformed with plasmid pMUPcopA (8Stoyanov J.V. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or pMUPmerT(17Parkhill J. Lawley B. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (14Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) as described previously (17Parkhill J. Lawley B. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). E. coli TG1 [cueR::kan] cells containing pMUPcopA(8Stoyanov J.V. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) were transformed with pSUcueR or other pSU18 vectors containing mutant cueR, and induced overnight with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures for metal induction experiments were grown overnight in the required medium with antibiotic selection to maintain resident plasmids. The overnight culture was diluted 100-fold into fresh medium without antibiotics and grown to mid-exponential phase. Metal induction was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. Assays were performed in triplicate and repeated several times. The direct effect of gold salts on β-galactosidase was tested by a standard enzyme assay using 96 units of β-galactosidase in 1 ml of Z-buffer (14Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) in the presence of 0, 50, or 150 μmAuCl3. Reactions were started with 0.1 ml 4 mg ml−1 o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside and stopped with 0.5 ml 1 m Na2CO3. Z-buffer is reducing, containing 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. No inhibition by gold was seen. The cueR mutants C112S; C120S; C129S,C130S; and H131N,H132N were generated by the gapped duplex method (13Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using 24- to 30-mer oligonucleotides containing the 1 or 2 mismatched bases. Site-directed mutagenesis by PCR overlap extension (19Horton R. Pease L. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 217-246Google Scholar) was used in later stages for creating H76N,H94N using primer pairs containing complementary mutating nucleotides, and flanking forward and reverse primers containing EcoRI andBamHI sites, on pSU18cueR as template. TruncatedcueR mutants were generated by PCR using a downstream primer containing a stop codon and a BamHI site, with a flanking upstream primer containing an EcoRI site. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned intoEcoRI-BamHI-cut pSU18, creating pSUcueR-mutant. All mutated DNA fragments were fully sequenced to confirm the required mutation and screen against undesired mutations. Solutions of cuprous ions, Cu(I), were made freshly on a daily basis as described elsewhere (20Byrd J. Berger R.M. McMillin D.R. Wright C.F. Hamer D.H. Winge D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6688-6694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dynamic response of the copA promoter was tested at a range of copper, silver, and gold ion concentrations in minimal medium (Fig. 2 A), and maximal responses were observed with additions of 100 μmCuSO4, 2.5 μm AgNO3, or 25 μm AuCl3 for mid-exponential phase cells. Gold toxicity caused a reduction in cell growth at higher metal concentrations. Similar relative concentrations for maximal induction were observed at different growth stages, although the absolute concentrations differed, presumably due to the production of metal-chelating extracellular material. AuCl3 does not inhibit β-galactosidase in vitro (data not shown), so reduction in induction at high gold concentrations is not due to direct effects on the reporter enzyme activity. The values of half-maximal induction, calculated from the induction profiles, were: for copper, ∼21 μm; for gold, ∼15.2 μm; and for silver, ∼1.9 μm; these values include differences in access of the metal to the regulator (sequestration, uptake, and reduction) as well as the induction per se. The values for silver and copper agree with those determined previously (8Stoyanov J.V. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The increases in induction with increasing metal ion concentrations are different for the three metals. Induction by gold of PcopA was abolished in a disruptant strain, E. coliTG1[cueR::kan R] (8Stoyanov J.V. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As with previous results for copper and silver (8Stoyanov J.V. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), metal induction of PcopA could be recovered by providing the cueRgene in trans (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, CueR activates transcription of PcopA in response to gold ions. To check that the response of CueR to gold was specific, a second member of this class of metal regulators, MerR and its promoter PmerTPAD, was tested in both E. coli TG1 and inE. coli CSH26ΔrecA (17Parkhill J. Lawley B. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Induction of the mercury resistance promoter, PmerTPAD, was observed only when the merR gene was provided in trans and induced with 1 μm HgCl2, but was not observed after induction with copper, silver, and gold or when merRwas not present, even though cueR was present on the chromosome (data not shown). The growth response of E. coli W3110 ΔcopA (5Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 94: 652-656Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar) to increasing concentrations of AuCl3 in LB medium was indistinguishable from that of the parental W3110 strain (data not shown), indicating that the CopA transporter does not confer gold resistance. The CueR protein contains several cysteine and histidine residues which are candidates for recognition and specific binding of activating metals. Cysteine residues at positions 112, 120, 129, and 130 were mutated to serine and histidines at positions 76, 94, 131, and 132 were altered to asparagine. These variants of the cueR gene were expressed in pSU18 vector (16Bartolome B. Jubete Y. Martinez E. de la Cruz F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) in E. coliTG1[cueR::kan R](pMUPcopA). The response of the complemented E. coliTG1[cueR::kan R] strain to metals was more variable between experiments than when the wild-typeE. coli TG1 was used, possibly due to the variable copy number of pSU18::cueR plasmids. However, qualitatively clear results were obtained, showing that mutations C112S or C120S eliminated the response to copper, silver, and gold salts (Fig. 3) as did all double and truncated mutants containing one of these mutations (data not shown). Furthermore, none of these mutants responded to lead, mercury, nickel, cadmium, or cobalt. A deletion from position 120 failed to respond to metals, while a deletion from position 128 had an attenuated response. The cysteines at positions C112 and C120 are analogous to C117 and C126 of Tn501 and Tn21 MerR, which are important for binding Hg(II) and activation of the transcription of themer operon (11Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Alanine A78 was replaced by cysteine to mimic the equivalent essential cysteine C82 in MerR (Fig. 1), but the mutant protein did not activate transcription in response to Hg(II)in vivo (data not shown). Double mutations H131N,H132N and, separately, C129S,C130S, were generated to investigate the importance of these distal, potentially metal-binding, amino acids and were tested in the induction assay (Fig. 3). The mutations H131N,H132N gave no significant change in the response to copper but gave an altered response to silver (decreased) and gold (increased) compared with the wild type. There was a slight increase of the background response without metal. The mutant C129S,C130S also showed relatively small changes in the response to copper and silver but there was a slight decrease in the response to gold. For neither mutant was the specificity of reaction with other metals altered. The retention of a response to copper, silver, and gold salts, albeit altered in magnitude, by these double mutations and by the seven amino acid C-terminal deletion from Gly128indicates that the full CCHH motif at positions 129–132 is not responsible for metal recognition by CueR, as we had originally hypothesized. A decrease of 30–40% but not abolition of the response to copper was found with the separate H76N and H94N mutations (data not shown), indicating that these two histidines are not essential to metal recognition. The effect of different chelating agents on the induction of PcopA was tested (Fig. 4). Bathocuproine disulfonate (21Chen S.H. Liu S.H. Liang Y.C. Lin J.K. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Glia. 2000; 31: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), cuprizone (22Pfeiffer S. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and neocuproine (21Chen S.H. Liu S.H. Liang Y.C. Lin J.K. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Glia. 2000; 31: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Pfeiffer S. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were used as copper chelators; EDTA was used as a nonspecific metal chelator. When PcopAwas induced in the presence of 100 μm bathocuproine, activation by Cu(I) was reduced by 84–86% and the activation by Cu(II) decreased by 35–69%; activation by silver was reduced by 70%; and activation by gold was increased by 9–34%. Activation of the mercury resistance promoter, PmerTPAD, in the presence ofmerR and 1 μm Hg(II) showed no significant difference in the presence and absence of bathocuproine. With 100 μm cuprizone, activation by Cu(I) was reduced 33–65% and by Cu(II) 16–46%, suggesting that cuprizone may not be specific for Cu(II), as advertised. Activation by silver increased by 29% and activation by gold increased by 42–45%, both of which may be due to the removal of relatively more poorly inducing copper ions by the chelator. No difference was observed for the activation of PmerTPAD by Hg(II). Activation of PcopA was observed in the presence of the membrane-permeable copper chelator neocuproine even in the absence of metal, resulting in 8.8-fold base level increase (Fig. 4). The increased induction by different metals was calculated by subtracting from each sample the background level in the control with chelator but without metal and comparing with the equivalent samples without chelator (with the “no chelator, no metal” control subtracted), thus enabling direct comparison of the results. The values were as follows: 3–4-fold increase in activation by Cu(I), 1.8–3-fold increase in activation by Cu(II), no change in activation by silver or with gold. Again there was no change in the response of PmerT and merR. These results suggest that neocuproine specifically carries copper into the cell. The background level may have increased due trace amounts of copper present in SM9 medium. Gold (as extracellular Au(III)) is not chelated by copper-specific chelators and activates the copA promoter in their presence to approximately the same extent as in the presence or absence of these chelators. Au(I) salts are too insoluble to use directly in chelation experiments. EDTA (200 μm) decreased the activation of the copA promoter to background levels by all metals (Fig. 4). None of the copper chelators had any effect on the induction of themer promoter by MerR and mercury, which suggests that all of the effects observed for copper, silver, and gold are metal-specific and not caused by the chelating agents. Au(I) is a soft metal ion with a covalent radius of 134 pm and and electronegativity of 1.42 (Allred-Rochow), identical to those properties of silver, but different to those of copper, 117 pm and 1.75, respectively (23Emsley J. The Elements. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The effective nuclear charge, the charge due to the protons of the nucleus less a screening factor due to the outer electrons of the atom, for gold, copper, and silver is identical at 4.20 (Slater). No other element has the same effective nuclear charge. The activation of PcopA by CueR and gold salts was unexpected from a biological point of view. The physical chemistry of gold ions suggests that they are mimicking Cu(I) and Ag(I) in the metal binding site of CueR, leading to activation of PcopA. Au(I) is a common valence for this element and may be produced in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm or in the periplasm by a reductase such as NDH2 (24Rapisarda V.A. Montelongo L.R. Farias R.N. Massa E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Rapisarda V.A. Chehin R.N. Rivas J.D. Rodriguez-Montelongo L. Farias R.N. Massa E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although Au(I) is practically insoluble in water, which has prevented us from simply confirming ourin vivo data with in vitro experiments, the local production of Au(I) salts is the most chemically convincing explanation for the mimicry of Cu(I) by gold salts, given the identical effective nuclear charge among the three elements. The exact levels of metal required for half-maximal induction of the promoter are extracellular values and differential uptake and reduction may account for the differences between the metal ions; Ag(I) alone would not be involved in redox reactions and has the lowest concentration for half-maximal induction. Carefully designed experimental conditions for in vitro study of the effect of the metals on CueR will need to be performed to confirm the valence state of gold required for activation of CueR. The lack of effect of a ΔcopA mutation on the gold sensitivity of growth of E. coli cells may be due to gold salts not being recognized by the CopA transporter, indicating that there are different mechanisms for proteins discriminating between copper and gold salts, or may be due to change to the valence state of gold as it is exported to the outside (oxidizing) side of the cytoplasmic membrane, or transport may not confer resistance to the metal. Such an effect has been shown for the CopB copper exporter ofEnterococcus hirae, which transports Cu(I) and Ag(I), but confers resistance only to Cu(I) and not to Ag(I) (26Solioz M. Odermatt A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9217-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The details of recognition of Cu(I) Ag(I) and Au(I) by the CueR regulator remain to be fully dissected. The observation that cysteine residues 112 and 120 are required for activation by all three metals indicates that the metals bind to the same site on the regulator, and the equivalence of these amino acids to Cys117 and Cys126 in MerR (Fig. 1) suggest that the metal binding site is in the same relative position on both regulators. Thus, it is not surprising that replacing alanine 78 with cysteine to mimic the equivalent essential cysteine in MerR (Fig. 1) has no effect on CueR response to Hg(II), as the spacing between Cys112 and Cys120 in CueR is different to that between Cys117 and Cys126 in MerR, and more subtle positioning and charge effects will undoubtedly be invovled in metal recognition. The recently described copper-dependent regulator, HmrR, from rhizobia (27Reeve W.G. Tiwari R.P. Kale N.B. Dilworth M.J. Glenn A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) contains cysteines equivalent to Cys112 and Cys120, but lacks a sequence equivalent to the CCHH motif at positions 129–132, providing indirect confirmation of our analysis. The detail of metal binding will require structural information on the CueR protein. The existing structures of MerR family regulators are for proteins responding to effectors other than metals (28Godsey M.H. Baranova N.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47178-47184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Zheleznova E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and cysteines 112 and 120 lie outside the regions of similarity between CueR and these regulators. The molecular homeostatic mechanisms for copper in humans continue to be identified. The toxicity of copper is due in part to its redox chemistry. Cuprous ions can be oxidized by peroxide to generate hydroxyl ions and radicals, which can attack and damage phospholipids in biological membranes and inactivate membrane bound enzymes (30Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1986; 2: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This type of damage is characteristic in people with copper toxicosis (Wilson's disease) due to a defect in the WND copper transport protein (31Mercer J.F.B. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease characterized by migration of phagocytes and other leukocytes into synovial and periarticular tissue and damage of these tissues by activated oxygen species from triggered phagocytes (32Aaseth J. Haugen M. Forre O. Analyst. 1998; 123: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Increased copper levels were found in the blood plasma of rheumathoid arthritis patients (33Bacon M.C. White P.H. Raiten D.J. Craft N. Margolis S. Levander O.A. Taylor M.L. Lipnick R.N. Sami S. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 20: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), copper toxicity and arthritis were linked in a patient with Wilson's disease (34Olsen B.S. Helin P. Mortensen H.B. Ugeskr. Laeg. 1996; 158: 4305-4306PubMed Google Scholar), and a copper-supplemented diet was shown to ameliorateMycobacterium butyricum-induced arthritis in rats (35Milanino R. Marrella M. Crivellente F. Benoni G. Cuzzolin L. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our speculation is that by mimicking copper, gold may act as an effective activator of the expression of copper transport proteins and alter the copper homeostasis within the arthritic tissues, by removing copper from locations where it might generate reactive oxygen species.

However, the molecular mechanism of how the nectin-afadin system is associated with the E-cadherin-catenin system or functions in the formation of AJs has not yet been fully understood. Here we identified a novel afadin-binding protein, named ADIP (afadin DIL domain-interactingprotein). ADIP consists of 615 amino acids with a calculated M r of 70,954 and has three coiled-coil domains. Northern and Western blot analyses in mouse tissues indicated that ADIP was widely distributed.

ADIP furthermore bound α-actinin, an F-actin-bundling protein known to be indirectly associated with E-cadherin through its direct binding to α-catenin. These results indicate that ADIP is an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein that localizes at cell-cell AJs and may have two functions.

In polarized epithelial cells, intercellular adhesion is mediated through a junctional complex composed of tight junctions (TJs),1 adherens junctions (AJs), and desmosomes. These junctional structures are typically aligned from the apical to basal sides, although desmosomes are independently distributed in other areas. AJs were originally defined using ultrastructural analysis as closely apposed plasma membrane domains reinforced by a dense cytoplasmic plaque, where actin filament (F-actin) bundles are undercoated (7Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Molecular analysis shows that AJs are cell-cell adhesion sites where classic cadherins function as cell adhesion molecules and where the actin-based cytoskeleton and several cytoplasmic components are assembled (8Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin.

E-cadherin, like other classical cadherins, is a single-pass transmembrane protein whose extracellular domain mediates homophilic recognition and adhesive binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner (10Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). E-cadherin associates with the actin cytoskeleton through peripheral membrane proteins, including α-, β-, and γ-catenins, α-actinin, and vinculin (9Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin.

All of the members have an extracellular domain with three immunoglobulin-like loops, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. Furthermore, all of them, except nectin-1β, -3γ, and -4, have a conserved motif of 4 amino acid (aa) residues (Glu/Ala-X-Tyr-Val) at their carboxyl termini, and this motif binds the PDZ domain of afadin (18Mandai K.

Afadin also has two Ras-associated domains, a forkhead-associated domain, a dilute (DIL) domain, a PDZ domain, and three proline-rich domains (see Fig. 1 A). F-actin binds to the region containing the third proline-rich domain (18Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S.

Human s-afadin is identical to the gene product of AF-6, a gene that has been identified as an ALL-1 fusion partner that is involved in acute myeloid leukemias (37Prasad R., Gu, Y. Alder H.

Nectin-1 has recently been determined by positional cloning to be responsible for cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia, which is characterized by cleft lip/palate, syndactyly, mental retardation, and ectodermal dysplasia (61Suzuki K., Hu, D. Bustos T. Zlotogora J. Richieri-Costa A. Helms J.A. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently found that the nectin-afadin system is involved in the formation of synapses in cooperation with N-cadherin in neurons (62Mizoguchi A. Nakanishi H. Kimura K. Matsubara K. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Katata T. Honda T. Kiyohara Y. Heo K. Higashi M. Tsutsumi T. Sonoda S. Ide C. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and that the nectin-afadin system constitutes an important adhesion system in the organization of Sertoli cell-spermatid junctions in the testis (63Ozaki-Kuroda K. Nakanishi H. Ohta H. Tanaka H. Kurihara H. Mueller S. Irie K. Ikeda W. Sakai T. Wimmer E. Nishimune Y. Takai Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 13: 1145-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nectin and afadin are therefore important for the organization of a wide variety of intercellular junctions either with or independently of known cell adhesion molecules. However, the molecular mechanism of how the nectin-afadin system is associated with the E-cadherin-catenin system or functions in the formation of these intercellular junctions has not yet been fully understood. To gain the insight into these issues, we attempted here to identify an afadin-binding protein using yeast two-hybrid screening. For this purpose, we used the DIL domain of afadin as a bait. The DIL domain has been found in afadin and type V myosins including dilute, Myo2, and Myo4, but its function remains unknown (64Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 265-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The recent finding that the region of Myo4 containing its DIL domain binds to an adapter protein, She3 (65Bohl F. Kruse C. Frank A. Ferring D. Jansen R.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5514-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 66Long R.M., Gu, W. Lorimer E. Singe R.H. Chartrand P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6592-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), implies that the DIL domain is involved in the protein-protein interaction. We have identified and characterized here a novel afadin-binding protein, named ADIP (afadin DIL domain-interactingprotein), that binds to the DIL domain of afadin. ADIP furthermore binds α-actinin, an F-actin-bundling protein known to be indirectly associated with E-cadherin through its direct binding to α-catenin (9Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16Knudsen K.A. Soler A.P. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ADIP is an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein that localizes at cell-cell AJs and may have two functions. ADIP may connect the nectin-afadin and E-cadherin-catenin systems through α-actinin, and ADIP may be involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton at AJs through afadin and α-actinin. One bait vector, pGBDU-afadin (aa 511–981), was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the aa residue of afadin into pGBDU-C1 (67James P. Hallady J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another bait vector, pGBD-mouse ADIP (mADIP)-M (aa 152–436), was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the aa residue of mADIP into pGBD-C1 (67James P. Hallady J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids, pGBDU-MYO4-DIL and pGAD-SHE3, were constructed by subcloning the fragments of MYO4 (aa 920–1471) and SHE3 (aa 1–425) into pGBDU-C2 and pGAD-C2, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid libraries constructed from mouse 11-day embryo, rat brain, rat lung, and human testis cDNAs were purchased from Clontech. Two-hybrid screening using the yeast strain PJ69-4A (MATatrp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ GAL2-ADE2 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 met2:: GAL7-lacZ) was performed as described (67James P. Hallady J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard procedures for yeast manipulations were performed as described (68Kaiser C.A. Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). For full-length cDNAs of mADIP and rat ADIP (rADIP), BLAST searches were conducted against GenBankTM and EMBL databases. A selection of hits obtained by BLAST searches against the human subset of GenBankTM and EMBL sequences was used to assemble the cDNA sequence of the human homologue of KIAA0923 (AB023140; GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ). A cDNA of KIAA0923 was kindly supplied by Dr. T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). The full-length cDNAs of mADIP (accession number AF532969) and rADIP (accession number AF532970) were generated from mouse and rat brain cDNAs (Clontech), respectively, by reverse transcription-coupled PCR using the following primer sets: for mADIP cDNA, 5′-CGTAGGAGAGTGACAGGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGTTATCGAGTTTTTCTACATGAC-3′; for rADIP cDNA, 5′-CGTAGGAGAGTGACAGGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-TTCCTGTTTTTGCACTGTAGCTG-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR4B (Invitrogen), and nucleotide sequence analysis was performed by the dideoxynucleotide termination method using a DNA sequencer (model 3100; Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The mammalian expression vectors, pCMV-FLAG, pCMV-T7, and pCMV-HA, were designed to express N-terminal FLAG-, T7-, and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged proteins, respectively (69Takaesu G. Kishida S.

The mammalian expression vector expressing the DIL domain of afadin (aa 606–983) was constructed with pCMV-T7. The mammalian expression vectors expressing mADIP and rADIP, pCMV-HA-mADIP (aa 1–615), pCMV-HA-mADIP-C (aa 339–615), pCMV-FLAG-mADIP-C (aa 339–615), and pCMV-FLAG-mADIP-M (aa 152–436), were constructed with pCMV-FLAG and pCMV-HA. The mammalian expression vector expressing α-actinin-1 (human, BC015766; GenBankTM), pCMV-HA-α-actinin-1-C (aa 406–892), was constructed with pCMV-HA.

The GST fusion vector of the DIL domain of afadin (aa 606–983), GST-DIL, was constructed with pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion vector of the two EF-hand domains of α-actinin-1 (aa 406–892), GST-α-actinin-1-C, was constructed with pGEX4T-1. The GST and MBP fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and amylose resin beads (New England Biolabs), respectively. The GST fusion proteins with fragments of rADIP-C (aa 159–613), mADIP-N (aa 1–226), and mADIP-C (aa 339–615) were produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and used as each antigen to raise polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) in rabbits. Two pAbs against rADIP-C (aa 159–613) and mADIP-C (aa 339–615), M05 and M01, were used after affinity purification with MBP-rADIP-C (aa 159–613) and MBP-mADIP-C (aa 339–615), respectively. Another pAb against mADIP-N (aa 1–226), M57, was used after affinity purification with GST-mADIP-N (aa 1–226). A mouse anti-afadin monoclonal Ab (mAb) was prepared as described (71Sakisaka T.

T-cell factor TCF-binding element electrophoretic mobility shift assay CREB-binding protein hemagglutinin glutathioneS-transferase Multicellular organisms characteristically employ a limited number of signaling systems in order to generate the panoply of different cell types found in the body. The repeated use of the same growth factor families and signaling pathways poses the question of how the same effector proteins can generate distinct, tissue-specific responses (1Ghazi A. VijayRaghavan K.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 419-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway provides an interesting model system to address this problem. Wnt growth factors constitute a large family of secreted glycoproteins that control numerous developmental processes in a wide range of organisms (2Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 3Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In order to evoke transcriptional responses, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade utilizes a small number of bipartite transcription factor complexes. These complexes are formed by β-catenin, which provides a transcriptional activation function, and by a member of the T-cell factor (TCF)1 family of DNA-binding proteins, which guides β-catenin to the promoter regions of specific target genes (4Hecht A. Kemler R. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Hurlstone A. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). β-Catenin belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins, which, as a signature motif, carry multiple copies of a 42-amino acid module, the Armadillo repeat (6Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In β-catenin, 12 copies of this repeat form the large, central domain of the protein and provide the interaction surface for most of the known binding partners of β-catenin (7Graham T.A. Weaver C.

The Armadillo repeat domain is flanked by short N- and C-terminal extensions, which harbor the transcriptional activation domains of β-catenin (11van de Wetering M. Cavallo R.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in Wnt signaling, β-catenin also performs a function in cell-cell adhesion, where it is crucial for the formation of cadherin-catenin complexes (2Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 3Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In mammals, four genes encode the TCF family members TCF1, LEF1, TCF3, and TCF4, which have some structural features in common (5Hurlstone A. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The extreme N terminus harbors the binding site for β-catenin. The recognition and occupation of specific DNA sequence motifs is mediated by nearly identical HMG-box domains, which are located near the C terminus or in the middle of TCFs. Interspersed between the β-catenin-binding domain and the HMG-box are sequences that interact with Groucho/TLE transcriptional corepressors (14Brantjes H. Roose J. van De Wetering M. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1410-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 15Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Roose J. Polevoy G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A.

Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Groucho/TLE factors are histone-binding proteins and additionally interact with a histone deacetylase (18Palaparti A. Baratz A. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26604-26610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This suggests that their function is to set up a specialized repressive chromatin structure that prevents inappropriate activation of β-catenin/TCF target genes in the absence of a Wnt signal. Since TCF proteins are functionally neutral on their own, their role in gene regulation is likely to serve as chromosomal docking sites for various interaction partners, thus promoting the formation of different transcription factor complexes with distinct properties. The participation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in multiple developmental programs necessitates that β-catenin-TCF complexes induce only subsets of all potential Wnt/β-catenin target genes at any particular time and that different sets of genes are addressed depending on the particular cellular background. How this is achieved is not understood. Several different mechanisms have been described whereby the formation and activity of β-catenin-TCF complexes is controlled by covalent modification of TCFs or competitive binding to β-catenin (3Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 4Hecht A. Kemler R. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Hurlstone A. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These mechanisms, however, appear to affect the expression of Wnt target genes indiscriminately. Alternatively, β-catenin could employ transcriptional coactivators in a promoter-specific manner. Among the cofactors of β-catenin are BCL9/Legless, Brg-1, p300, and the closely related CBP (20Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D. Froesch B. Chatterjee S. Murone M. Zullig S. Basler K.

Clevers H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). CBP and p300 are widely used transcriptional coactivators that can provide a link to the basal transcription machinery or can target chromatin structure through their intrinsic acetylase activity (26Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both p300 and CBP have been implicated in differential promoter activation by β-catenin (21Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wolf D. Rodova M. Miska E.A. Calvet J.P. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25562-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, several observations closely link TCF family members to mechanisms that generate promoter-specific transcriptional responses. TCFs can interact with Smad proteins, and this interaction appears to be critically involved in the combinatorial regulation of the Xenopus laevis Twin gene promoter by the transforming growth factor β and Wnt signaling pathways (28Labbe E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8358-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 29Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W. Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Similarly, an interaction between LEF1 and the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein microphtalmia-associated transcription factor has been implicated in the melanocyte-specific expression of Wnt target genes (30Yasumoto K. Takeda K. Saito H. Watanabe K. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple isoforms with different functionalities arise from TCF genes by way of alternative splicing and the use of dual promoters, and different TCF family members perform distinct tasks in developmental processes (31Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K.A. Knochel W. Wedlich D. Kuhl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Van de Wetering M. Castrop J.

Dev. 1998; 75: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It thus appears that TCF family members and their isoforms are intrinsically different and can support the execution of different developmental programs. To better understand the mechanisms whereby Wnt signals selectively activate target genes, we began to compare TCF family members with respect to their ability to support β-catenin-mediated activation of different β-catenin/TCF target gene promoters. Here we report that LEF1 and the TCF4E isoform have opposing capabilities to synergize with β-catenin at the Siamois and the Cdx1promoters. A promoter-specific transcriptional activation domain was identified at the C terminus of TCF4E, which can interact with the p300 transcriptional adaptor. The interaction between TCF4E and p300 differs from the β-catenin/p300 interaction, because β-catenin induces a posttranslational modification of p300, whereas TCF4E does not. We propose that TCF4E supports the promoter-specific assembly of a dormant transcription factor complex, the transcriptional activity of which is triggered by β-catenin-induced phosphorylation of p300. Expression vectors for murine β-catenin, human p300, human TCF4E, and mouse LEF1 were the same as in Hecht et al. (21Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other plasmids were generated by standard cloning techniques or polymerase chain reaction-based strategies (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.J. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Details of the constructs are available upon request. For EMSA, LEF1 and TCF4 proteins were transcribed and translated in vitrousing the SP6 TNT system (Promega). Translation efficiency was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies (3F10; Roche Applied Science). DNA probes used were complementary pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides derived from the TCRα gene enhancer (TCRα25, 5′-TCGACCTGCAGGTAGGGCACCCTTTGAAGCTCTCCC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGGGAGAGCTTCAAAGGGTGCCCTACCTGCAGG-3′; TCF consensus motifs underlined) or a BamHI/XbaI fragment with Cdx1 promoter sequences from positions −224 to −52 (38Travis A.

Kemler R. Development. 2000; 127: 3805-3813PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments were labeled by fill-in with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). For DNA binding, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μl of the TNT samples containing similar amounts of LEF1 and TCF4 proteins and 5 fmol of radiolabeled probe were combined in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.9, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin and 0.25 μg of poly(dI:dC). Total volume was 15 μl. Control reactions received 2 μl of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min on ice, supplemented with 2 μl of a solution containing 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, and loaded onto 5 or 6% polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA running buffer (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.J. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V constant voltage. Gels were transferred onto Whatman paper, dried, and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. Human 293 embryonic kidney cells (ATCC number CRL-1658) and U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells (ATCC number HTB-96) were cultured as described (21Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To monitor TCF protein expression, 2.5 × 105 293 cells, seeded into 35-mm dishes, were transfected with 2.5 μg of expression vector using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitations, 293 cells were transfected as before (21Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, cells were plated into 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected 4 h later with a FuGENE6/DNA mixture containing 10 ng of pRL-CMV or pCMVβ (Promega) as internal standard, 100 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, and expression vectors for β-catenin (50 ng), TCF (10 ng), and p300 (250 ng) together with increasing amounts of competitor as indicated. Total amounts of DNA were kept constant by adding empty expression vector where needed. Firefly luciferase reporters were p01234, pCdx1-4 Luc, and pCdx1 (−350/+72) Luc (39Lickert H. Domon C. Huls G.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2359-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in cell lysates were determined as before (21Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 96-well plates and a Labsystems Luminoskan Ascent luminometer. To measure Renilla luciferase activity, 100 μl of a solution with 0.5 μm coelenterazine (Calbiochem) in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA was injected per well of a 96-well plate, and after a delay of 0.5 s, light emission was recorded for 5 s. Reporter gene activities shown are average values and their S.D. values, obtained from at least three independent experiments after normalization against β-galactosidase or Renillaluciferase activities. Protein extracts from cells transfected in 35-mm dishes were made by lysing cells in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing “Complete” protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). After boiling for 5 min and sonication, one-tenth of each lysate was loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described (21Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that TCF4/p300 immunoprecipitates were washed for 10 min at 4 °C once with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 120 mm NaCl and twice with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer with 75 mm NaCl. For Western blot analyses, immunoprecipitates were eluted from protein G-Sepharose beads in SDS-gel loading buffer and run on 6% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science), anti-p300 (catalog no. 05-267; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories) primary antibodies and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL system; AmershamBiosciences). For GST pull-down assays, 2 μg of GST or the various GST-TCF4 fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (21Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After preincubation in binding buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C, [35S]methionine-labeled p300 was added, after which binding proceeded for 2 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin, material retained on the glutathione-Sepharose matrix was eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels, and visualized by fluorography. Radiolabeled p300 for these experiments was transcribed and translated in vitro using the SP6-based TNT system (Promega). For each binding reaction, we used a 4-μl aliquot of a 50-μl TNT reaction. Transfected 293 cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of IPK buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and “Complete” protease inhibitor mix). After clearance by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, 1–2 μl of cell lysate were treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 10 μl in the buffer supplied with the enzyme. Untreated or phosphatase-treated samples were loaded onto 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and separated by electrophoresis at 75 V. Run times were extended for up to 2 h after the bromphenol blue tracking dye had left the gel. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, p300 was visualized by Western blotting as described above. To test whether downstream components of the Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway contribute to the differential regulation of Wnt target genes, we asked whether LEF1 and TCF4E were equally capable of supporting activation of Wnt-regulated promoters by β-catenin and p300. LEF1 and the TCF4E splice variant are representatives of the short and long isoforms of TCF family members (5Hurlstone A. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Their main differences are the extended C terminus in TCF4E with binding motifs for the transcriptional corepressor CtBP and a context-dependent transactivation domain at the N terminus of LEF1 (Fig. 1 A). Transactivation properties of LEF1 and TCF4E were compared at the promoters of the mouse Cdx1 gene and the Siamoisgene of X. laevis (39Lickert H. Domon C. Huls G. Wehrle C. Duluc I. Clevers H. Meyer B.I. Freund J.N. Kemler R. Development. 2000; 127: 3805-3813PubMed Google Scholar, 40Brannon M. Gomperts M. Sumoy L. Moon R.T. Kimelman D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2359-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Both of these genes are Wnt/β-catenin targets, which contain multiple TCF-binding elements (TBEs) in their promoter regions, and in their natural contexts they are regulated in a highly cell type-specific manner. Combinations of expression vectors for epitope-tagged TCF4E and LEF1, an activated form of β-catenin with Ala substitutions in the N-terminal destruction box (β-catS33A) (3Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 41Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar), and p300 were transfected into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 and the human osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS together with the pCdx1–4 Luc and p01234 luciferase reporter constructs (Fig. 1, C and D). When β-catenin, TCF4E, LEF1, and p300 were expressed individually, they had little or no effect on promoter activity. Pairwise combinations of β-catenin and LEF1 or β-catenin and TCF4E only weakly activated the luciferase reporters. Low levels of reporter gene expression were also induced by β-catenin and p300. In the absence of transfected TCFs, β-catenin presumably employs a limited pool of endogenous TCFs (14Brantjes H. Roose J. van De Wetering M. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1410-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, high levels of reporter gene activation were obtained when β-catenin, p300, and one of the TCFs were expressed simultaneously. Importantly, however, TCF4E and LEF1 clearly differed in their ability to synergize with β-catenin and p300, although they are expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1,B and D). In both 293 and U-2 OS cells, TCF4E supported β-catenin/p300-dependent activation of theCdx1 promoter but not of the Siamois promoter. Conversely, LEF1 mediated activation of the Siamois promoter but not of the Cdx1 promoter (Fig. 1 D). Even when we raised the amount of transfected plasmid, LEF1 did not support activation of the Cdx1 reporter (not shown). Thus, the two TCF family members are functionally different and act in a promoter-specific manner. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying its promoter-specific activity, we determined which domain in TCF4E is required for activation of the Cdx1 promoter. A panel of deletion mutants was constructed (Fig. 2 A), and Western blotting experiments were performed to confirm that all mutants were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2 B). Functional testing revealed that all mutants that lack the C1.1 domain (amino acids 436–482 of the TCF4E C terminus) are unable to synergize with β-catenin and p300 inCdx1 promoter activation (TCF4ΔC, TCF4ΔC1, and TCF4ΔC1.1) (Fig. 2 D). Constructs that retain this domain but have deletions in other parts of the TCF4E C terminus (TCF4ΔC2 and TCF4ΔC1.2) activate the Cdx1 promoter. From these results, we conclude that the C1.1 domain contains at least essential parts, if not all, of a promoter-specific transactivation domain. In addition, because activation of the Cdx1 promoter by TCF4E was seen with the short reporter construct used in these experiments (Fig. 2 C), it appears that the proximal promoter region with its TBEs contains all of the determinants that make the Cdx1promoter specifically responsive to TCF4E. To rule out the possibility that LEF1 and the inactive TCF4 mutants were unable to activate the Cdx1 promoter because they could not access it, we performed competition experiments. For this, activation of the Cdx1 promoter by β-catenin, p300, and TCF4E was challenged by coexpressing increasing amounts of LEF1 and TCF4ΔC. As shown in Fig. 3 A, higher levels of both factors progressively inhibited Cdx1 reporter activation. Deletion of the DNA-binding domain of LEF1 (Fig. 3 A, LEF1ΔHMG) and, to a lesser extent, removal of the β-catenin-binding domain (Fig. 3 A, LEF1ΔN) impaired this effect. Accordingly, the dominant negative activity of LEF1, and presumably of the TCF4ΔC mutant, most likely results from a combination of promoter blockade and sequestration of β-catenin. Therefore, LEF1 is capable of binding to the Cdx1 promoter in living cells and of competing with TCF4E. However, LEF1 and TCF4 isoforms lacking the C1.1 domain do not form productive transcription factor complexes at theCdx1 promoter. Since LEF1 can occupy the Cdx1 promoter construct, we wondered whether the addition of the C-terminal activation domain of TCF4E would endow LEF1 with the ability to stimulate Cdx1promoter activity. A LEF1-TCF4E chimera was generated (Fig. 3,C and D), and when coexpressed together with either β-catenin or p300 alone, the LEF1-T4C fusion mediated even higher levels of Cdx1 reporter activity than TCF4E (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of both p300 and β-catenin, TCF4E and LEF1-T4C activated the Cdx1 promoter equally well. For its function, the chimeric protein required an intact DNA-binding domain. This shows that the LEF1-T4C chimera must be able to bind to theCdx1 promoter in order to activate and rules out the possibility that LEF1-T4C stimulates the reporter only indirectly. Thus, the presence of the TCF4E C terminus turns LEF1 into an activator at the Cdx1 promoter. Together with the previous results, this demonstrates that the transactivation domain present at the C terminus of TCF4E is necessary and sufficient to confer promoter specificity upon TCF proteins. Wnt target gene activation depends on sequence-specific promoter recognition by TCFs and on TCF-β-catenin complex formation. However, no differences were seen with respect to the ability of LEF1, TCF4E, or TCF4ΔC to interact with β-catenin (not shown). Therefore, we compared the DNA binding properties of LEF1, wild-type and mutant TCF4E, and the LEF1-T4C chimera by EMSA with two different DNA probes (Fig. 4). The TCRα25 probe harbors a single consensus TBE derived from the T-cell receptor α-chain enhancer (38Travis A. Amsterdam A. Belanger C. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The second probe was a Cdx1 promoter fragment, which contains three TCF binding motifs: TBE3a, TBE3, and TBE4 (39Lickert H. Domon C. Huls G. Wehrle C. Duluc I. Clevers H. Meyer B.I. Freund J.N. Kemler R. Development. 2000; 127: 3805-3813PubMed Google Scholar). The TBE3a element is a newly discovered TBE that was not reported previously. The TCF proteins were transcribed and translatedin vitro, and similar amounts of the various factors, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 4 A), were used. Although both probes were bound by LEF1 and TCF4E, LEF1 exhibited an affinity for the single binding site of the TCRα25 probe that was at least 5 times higher than that of TCF4E (Fig. 4 C, comparelanes 3–5 with lanes 6–8). Interestingly, this difference was also seen when oligonucleotides with a single TBE (either TBE3a, -3, or -4) derived from the Cdx1 promoter were used as probes (no"
https://openalex.org/W1992195472,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11; also named PITSLRE) is part of the large family of p34cdc2-related kinases whose functions appear to be linked with cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, and apoptotic signaling. However, substrates of CDK11 during apoptosis have not been identified. We used a yeast two-hybrid screening strategy and identified eukaryotic initiation factor 3 p47 protein (eIF3 p47) as an interacting partner of caspase-processed C-terminal kinase domain of CDK11 (CDK11p46). We demonstrate that the eIF3 p47 can interact with CDK11 in vitro and in vivo, and the interaction can be strengthened by stimulation of apoptosis. EIF3 p47 contains a Mov34/JAB domain and appears to interact with CDK11p46 through this motif. We show in vitrothat the caspase-processed CDK11p46 can phosphorylate eIF3 p47 at a specific serine residue (Ser46) and that eIF3 p47 is phosphorylated in vivo during apoptosis. Purified recombinant CDK11p46 inhibited translation of a reporter gene in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, a kinase-defective mutant CDK11p46M did not inhibit translation of the reporter gene. Stable expression of CDK11p46 in vivo inhibited the synthesis of a transfected luciferase reporter protein and overall cellular protein synthesis. These data provide insight into the cellular function of CDK11 during apoptosis.

These data provide insight into the cellular function of CDK11 during apoptosis. It is becoming increasingly clear that in addition to controlling the cell cycle, cyclin-dependent kinases may have other functions within the cell. The CDK11 (also known as PITSLRE) protein kinases are members of the cyclin-dependent kinase superfamily. Two distinct but closely related human CDK11 genes (Cdc2L 1 and Cdc2L 2) express several CDK11 isoforms (1Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nelson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28505-28513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CDK11 homologues exist in several species including humans, mice, chickens,Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Xenopus (3Malek S.N. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33009-33020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Li H. Grenet J. Valentine M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1759-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The highly conserved nature of the CDK11 suggests important cellular functions. Although CDK11 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase superfamily, their function within the cell is not totally clear. However, recent studies indicate that the p110 isoform of CDK11 (CDK11p110) may be involved in some aspect of RNA processing or transcription by virtue of the fact that CDK11 co-immunoprecipitate and/or co-purify with multiple transcriptional elongation factors (6Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Trembley J.H. Hu D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CDK11p110associates with cyclin L (8Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 29: 29Google Scholar). Cyclin L is an RS domain protein that may function in pre-mRNA splicing (8Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 29: 29Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CDK11p110 kinases play some role in the production of translatable RNA transcripts in proliferating cells. The CDK11p110 isoforms contain an internal ribosome entry site, which leads to the generation of a CDK11p58 isoform during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (9Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated expression of CDK11p58 in eukaryotic cells alters normal cytokinesis and can delay cells in late telophase (10Bunnell B.A. Heath L.S. Adams D.E. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7467-7471Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, reduced expression of CDK11p58 increases DNA replication and enhances cell growth (11Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This p58 isoform of CDK11 can interact with cyclin D3 (12Zhang S. Cai M. Xu S. Chen S. Chen X. Chen C. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35314-35322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This suggests that CDK11p58/cyclin D3 may play role in mitosis. In regard to apoptosis, increased expression of CDK11p58reduces cell growth due to apoptosis (1Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, our group and others have shown that the CDK11p110 isoform and the CDK11p58 isoform are cleaved by caspases to generate a smaller 46–50-kDa protein that contains the catalytic portion of the protein (2Ariza M.E.

This smaller CDK11p46 isoform can be triggered by Fas, tumor necrosis factor A, or staurosporine and phosphorylate histone H1. Caspase inhibitors can modulate the kinase activity of the caspase-processed isoform of CDK11 (2Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nelson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28505-28513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that CDK11 may play a role in apoptotic signaling. However, substrates potentially regulated by CDK11 during apoptosis have not been identified. The present study was performed to address this issue. We identify the p47 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3 1The abbreviations used are: eIF3, eukaryotic initiation factor 3; 7-AAD, 7-aminoactinomycin D; CDK11, cyclin-dependent kinase 11; Ct, threshold cycle; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MS, mass spectrometry; m/z , mass to charge ratio; RT, reverse transcription; WT, wild type; DEVD-FMK, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone p47) as a protein associated with the caspase-processed isoform of CDK11 (CDK11p46) using a yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction between CDK11p46 and eIF3 p47 occurs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CDK11 protein kinase isolated from cells undergoing apoptosis can phosphorylate eIF3 p47in vitro, and serine phosphorylation of eIF3 p47 occurs in cells during apoptosis. Taken together, these results strongly support our hypothesis that CDK11 may be involved in apoptotic signaling by interacting with eIF3 p47. A375 human melanoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Inc., Tarzana, CA), 1%l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For induction of apoptosis, cells were treated with either 0.5 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or 10 ng/ml staurosporine (Sigma) from the second day of seeding for the indicated time. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GN1 is an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised by injection of rabbit with purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused with the sequence coding for amino acids 341–413 of CDK11p110 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). CDK11 monoclonal antibody P1C recognizes the last 75 amino acids of CDK11p110 and was a gift from Drs. Vincent Kidd and Jill Lahti (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) (7Trembley J.H.

EIF3 p47 antibody is a polyclonal antibody raised by injection of goat with purified recombinant GST-fused full-length eIF3 p47 (Rockland). eIF3 antibody was raised in a goat as described (15Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal HA antibody, monoclonal c-Myc antibody and monoclonal anti-phosphoserine antibody were purchased from Sigma. Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system 2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to perform yeast two-hybrid screening according to the manufacturer's instructions. The wild type and K451M substituted CDK11 C-terminal portion (CDK11p46) were used as baits. In the K451M altered CDK11p46, one lysine residue that is associated with phosphate transfer was substituted with a methionine. This substitution was performed to stabilize the interaction between the kinase and its substrate (16Wu X. Noh S.J. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A total of 5 × 106 transformants from a human fetal brain Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech) were screened in the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech), and 28 colonies were identified as His+Ade+, out of which 13 were positive for β-galactosidase. Among the 13 positive clones, 12 were isolated when the K451M mutant CDK11p46 was used as bait, whereas one clone was isolated using wild type CDK11p46 as bait. One of these clones (clone 4) was revealed to encode the full-length cDNA to the p47 subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 gene by sequence analysis. To confirm the CDK11p46/eIF3 p47 interaction in yeast, 0.1 μg of clone 4, and wild type bait plasmid were co-transfected into yeast strain AH109 using the lithium acetate transformation method. Growth selection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). pCMV-Myc-CDK11p46 containing the CDK11p46 coding sequence (GenBankTM accession number U04824; nucleotides 1282–2465) with a c-Myc tag at the N terminus was constructed. CDK11p46 was generated by PCR using p110KS+ (a gift from Dr. Vincent Kidd) as template. pGEX-4T-2-CDK11p46 that produces a GST fusion CDK11p46 in bacteria was constructed by inserting the same PCR product of CDK11p46 in frame into the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). pcDNA3-CDK11p46 was constructed by cloning the PCR amplified CDK11p46 with an in frame start codon ATG (nucleotides 1121–2465) into the EcoRI site of a eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for stable transfection purposes. pCMV-HA-eIF3 p47, containing the full-length coding sequence to the eIF3 p47 with a HA tag at the N terminus, was constructed. Full-length eIF3 p47 was isolated from the original fetal brain cDNA clone we obtained by yeast two-hybrid assay using EcoRI/XhoI restriction enzymes. The full-length eIF3 p47 was cloned into pGEX-4T-2 to generate GST-eIF3 p47 fusion protein expressed in E. coli. Four DNA fragments encoding truncated eIF3 p47, amino acids 106–360, 170–360, 248–360, and 1–113 were obtained by PCR amplification and cloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector to generate deletion GST-p47 fusion proteins. The K451R mutation was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with CDK11p46 wild type construct as template. Sequencing analysis was used to confirm the mutation. This mutation has been shown to cause CDK11 to lose its kinase activity (1Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, we created this mutation in the ATP binding domain to inactivate the kinase. The mutagenesis primers were 5′-GAAATTGTGGCTCTAAGGCGGCTGAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CCATCTTCAGCCGCCTTAGAGCCACAATTTC-3′. Cells were harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Following lysis, cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Total cell lysate (500 μg) was precleared with protein A- or G-agarose beads (Oncogene, La Jolla, CA) and goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. Myc-CDK11p46 fusion protein or eIF3 was then immunoprecipitated using c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or goat eIF3 polyclonal antibody (15Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and protein A- or G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. The immune complex was then washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and the blots were probed with different antibodies. A secondary probe with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies (Sigma) was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). pCMV-HA-eIF3 p47 transiently transfected A375 cells were grown on coverslips, washed twice with cold PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 6 min. Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS again and incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and then the bovine serum albumin was removed. The coverslips were then incubated with CDK11p110-specific antibody P1C (1:500 dilution) and rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:50 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS for 5 min each and then incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG + IgM (1:100 dilution) and Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution) in darkness for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation, coverslips were washed three times with PBS, mounted with DAKO mounting medium, and stored at 4 °C overnight for immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analysis. A375 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were then homogenized using the Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton, Millville, NJ) with 25–30 strokes, and the percentage of nuclei was checked by trypan blue staining. Nuclei were collected at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant contained the cytoplasm. GST, GST-CDK11p46, GST- CDK11p46M, and GST-p47 were induced by 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and expressed in BL21 bacteria for 4 h at 30 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified using Bulk GST Purification Module according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). Purified proteins were concentrated using Centricon 30 (Amicon Inc.) to an appropriate concentration and stored as aliquots at −70 °C. The assay was performed as described previously (12Zhang S. Cai M. Xu S. Chen S. Chen X. Chen C. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35314-35322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, GST or GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells, and equal amounts of bacterial lysates were incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min. The beads were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 5 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated [35S]methionine-labeled CDK11p46 overnight at 4 °C. [35S]Methionine-labeled CDK11p46 was produced using a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The beads were then washed five times with binding buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The bound CDK11p46 protein was analyzed by autoradiography after resolved by SDS-PAGE. A375 cells were treated with anti-Fas (Upstate Biotechnology) or with both anti-Fas and caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-FMK (50 μm) for 0, 24, 36, and 48 h and harvested, and kinase assays were carried out as described (2Ariza M.E.

Lysates of A375 cells stably transfected with kinase mutant CDK11p46M were also used in the kinase assays. 5 μg of either GST or GST-eIF3 p47 were used as substrates for kinase assays. Phosphorylation of the substrates was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The gel was exposed overnight at room temperature.Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant software was used to quantitate the relative phosphorylation level of the substrates. Caspase-processed CDK11p110 was immunoprecipitated from anti-Fas-treated A375 cells. Recombinant eIF3 p47 was then phosphorylated by caspase-processed CDK11p110as previously described (2Ariza M.E.

The recombinant eIF3 p47 was excised from the gel, digested with pepsin, and analyzed for phosphoamino acids by mass spectrometry as previously described (17Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R.

First, a time course study and a dose response study were performed to determine the linear range of luciferase production using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. 50 ng of luciferase mRNA were added into the system and incubated at 30 °C for 0–120 min followed by measurement of luciferase activity every 15 min to determine the luciferase production rate over the time course. The production of luciferase is in a linear range up to 75 min of incubation. 20–50 ng of luciferase mRNA were incubated with the system at 30 °C for 60 min followed by measurement of luciferase activity. The production of luciferase is in a linear range between 20 and 50 ng of luciferase mRNA. Therefore, 40 ng of firefly luciferase mRNA was added to 50 μl of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation reaction (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of recombinant purified 18–70 nm of CDK11p46, CDK11p46M, 70 nm GST, or elution buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer. In addition, newly synthesized35S-labeled luciferase proteins were analyzed by subjecting equal amounts of reaction mixtures to 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 25 ng of pGL3 control vector (Promega) containing SV40 promoter-driven luciferase gene was transfected into A375 cells that were stably transfected with either pcDNA3 (A375-pcDNA3), pcDNA3-CDK11p46M(A375-CDK11p46M), or pcDNA3-CDK11p46(A375-CDK11p46) in 24-well plates in triplicate. After 24 h, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Total RNAs were extracted from A375-pcDNA3 and A375-CDK11p46cells transfected with pGL3 control vector and A375 cells untransfected with pGL3 in triplicate using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed with 2 μg of total RNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). 2 μl of the cDNA mix was added to 20 μl of the PCR containing 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga, Japan), 1× buffer, and 1 pmol of primers. For histone, PCR was carried out at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min using the primers Histone-F (5′-CCACTGAACTTCTGATTCGC-3′) and Histone-R (5′-GCGTGCTAGCTGGATGTCTT-3′). For luciferase, PCR was carried out at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min using the primers LucF (5′-AATTGCTTCTGGTGGCGCTC-3′) and LucR (5′-GGGGTGTTGGAGCAAGATGG-3′). The amplified fragments were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Real time RT-PCR was performed using SYBR® Green PCR Core Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) and amplified in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences prism 5700 sequence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dissociation curves were performed to determine the specificity of the amplicon. Each sample was completed in triplicate, and no template control was included. Threshold cycle (Ct) during the exponential phase of amplification was determined by real time monitoring of fluorescent emission. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a control gene. Primers for GAPDH were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primers for luciferase are 5′-CGTCTTAATGTATAGATTTGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-TGGCGAAGAAGGAGAATAG-3′. Luciferase mRNA levels were demonstrated as the absolute number of copies normalized against GAPDH mRNA. Difference in amplification was indicated as 1/(Ct luciferase − Ct GAPDH) (19Philip T. Guglielmi C. Hagenbeek A. Somers R. Van der Lelie H. Bron D. Sonneveld P. Gisselbrecht C. Cahn J.Y.

A375 or A375-CDK11p46 cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium without leucine (U.S. Biological, Swampscott, MA) in triplicate and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time. Cells were either treated with ethanol or treated with 10 ng/ml of staurosporine for the indicated time. 6 h before the end of the incubation, 1 μCi ofl-[3,4,5-3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per well was added. The cells were collected onto UniFilter by cell harvester, and the incorporated [3H]leucine was measured by a microplate scintillation counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). Cells were stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and analyzed for apoptosis using a FACStar flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) as described (2Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M.

Cell morphology analysis was performed by cytospin preparation of cells followed by methanol fixation for 6 min. Slides were air dried and stained for 15 min in Giemsa stain. Slides were then rinsed in deionized water and air-dried followed by light microscopy analysis at ×15 magnification. Cell viability was measured with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described (2Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nelson M.A. J. Biol.

The yeast two-hybrid method was used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library using the caspase processed C-terminal portion containing the kinase domain of CDK11p110 (CDK11p46) as bait, and 13 CDK11p46-interacting cDNA clones were isolated. DNA sequencing and data base searching revealed that the nucleotide sequence of clone 4 encoded the full-length human p47 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3 p47). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by co-transformation of the bait and clone 4 again into yeast AH109, and various positive controls and negative controls were included in the nutritional deficiency selection. Characterization of the other 12 clones is in progress in our laboratory. The interaction of CDK11p46 with eIF3 p47 was further tested in vitro using a GST pull-down assay. The in vitro translated 35S-labeled CDK11p46could directly and specifically bind to GST-p47 eIF3 fusion protein (Fig. 1 B). EIF3 p47 is a Mov34 family member. The function of the Mov34/JAB_MPN domain in eIF3 p47 has not been established. We speculated that Mov34/JAB_MPN related domain in eIF3 p47 might be involved in protein-protein interactions. To determine the region in eIF3 p47 interacting with CDK11p46, we deleted specific sequences within eIF3, made fusion proteins, and performed GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1 A). In the GST pull-down assay, in vitro translated 35S-labeled CDK11p46 protein could be pulled down by GST-p47 amino acids 106–360 and GST-p47 amino acids 170–360 but not by GST-p47 amino acids 248–360 or GST-p47 amino acids 1–113 (Fig. 1,A and B). This suggests that the region within eIF3 p47 that directly interacts with CDK11p46 is between amino acids 113 and 248, which contains the Mov34/JAB_MPN domain. Therefore, the interaction of the caspase-processed isoform of CDK11 (CDK11p46) with eIF3 p47 may be mediated through the Mov34/JAB_MPN domain in vitro, and the major region of interaction appears to be the C-proximal half of the Mov34 domain. To further demonstrate the interaction in human cells, an expression vector with an HA epitope-tagged full-length eIF3 p47 was constructed and transfected into A375 cells. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using an anti-HA antibody revealed that p47 localized both in nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, especially the region around nucleus (Fig. 2 A). CDK11p110 localizes predominantly to the nucleoplasm as revealed by P1C antibody. No fluorescence was seen with the HA antibody in untransfected cells (data not shown). Merging of the two images showed a yellow color in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 2 A), indicating that a portion of eIF3 p47 co-localizes in the nucleus with CDK11. To confirm this observation, we performed cell fractionation and Western blot analysis. Again, we observed both a cytoplasmic and nuclear pool of eIF3 p47, whereas CDK11 was seen in the nucleus (Fig. 2 B). Thus, CDK11 and a portion of eIF3 p47 can both be found in the nucleus. In addition, reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western analysis with Myc-tagged CDK11p46 and HA-tagged eIF3 p47 from transfected HEK293 cells showed that CDK11p46 and eIF3 p47 could associate in cells (Fig. 2 C). These results together with the following endogenous interaction data suggest that CDK11p46 interacts with eIF3 p47 in human cells. Next we tested whether p47 is a potential substrate of CDK11 during apoptosis. During apoptosis, the p110 isoform of CDK11 is cleaved by caspase-3 into a p46–50 C-terminal fragment containing the kinase domain and a p60 N-terminal fragment (2Ariza M.E. Broome-Powell M. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. Nelson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28505-28513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We saw a weak interaction between the endogenous CDK11p110 isoform and eIF3 in untreated A375 cells (Fig. 3,lane 6). Interestingly, when apoptosis is induced by anti-Fas, the caspase-processed C-terminal fragment of CDK11p110 interacted strongly with eIF3. The interaction was strongest at 36 h after stimulation of apoptosis (Fig. 3,lanes 7–9). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by including nonspecific goat IgG as negative controls (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4), and the correct sizes of the expected protein bands are shown in lanes 5,10, and 11 (Fig. 3). In CDK11p46stable transfected cells, the interaction between eIF3 and CDK11p46 (p46-p50) was strong (Fig. 3, lane 5), which means that the overexpresse"

IQ motifs, which are found in over 100 human proteins, appear in tandem repeats and bind calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+. One of these IQ-containing proteins, IQGAP1, interacts with several targets, including Cdc42, β-catenin, E-cadherin, and actin, in a calmodulin-regulated manner. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which apocalmodulin and Ca2+/calmodulin differentially regulate IQGAP1, a series of constructs of IQGAP1 with selected point mutations of the four tandem IQ motifs were generated. Mutating the basic charged arginine residues in all four IQ motifs abrogated binding of IQGAP1 to apocalmodulin, but had no effect on its interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin. Analysis of IQGAP1 constructs with point mutations in single, double, or triple IQ motifs revealed that apocalmodulin bound only to IQ3 and IQ4. By contrast to the arginine mutant constructs, mutation of selected hydrophobic residues in the IQ motifs produced an IQGAP1 protein incapable of binding either apocalmodulin or Ca2+/calmodulin. These results, which differ from the conventional model of Ca2+-independent binding of calmodulin to IQ motifs, provide insight into the complexity of the molecular interactions between calmodulin and IQ motifs.

To perform site-directed mutagenesis, a PacI linker was inserted into pBluescript KS at an SspI site to produce pBluescript-PacI.

Briefly, cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 100-mm dishes. Five micrograms of plasmid DNA was mixed with 15 μl of FuGENE 6 and added to the cells. After 24 to 48 h, cells were harvested, lysed, and processed as described below. Mutant and wild type IQGAP1 cDNAs were subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)1 fusion constructs of wild type and the indicated mutant constructs of IQGAP1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated by glutathione-Sepharose essentially as described previously (19Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All GST-IQGAP1 constructs were >90% pure (data not shown). Cells were lysed in 500 μl of buffer A (150 mm NaC1, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmCaC12 or 1 mm EGTA. Equal amounts of protein lysate were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were then incubated with 500 ng of GST-IQGAP1 on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. In all cases, GST alone was used as control. After sedimentation by centrifugation, samples were washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The resultant Western blots were probed with anti-Myc (16Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and anti-calmodulin (25Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) primary antibodies, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Where indicated, GST fusion proteins were incubated with 2 μg of calmodulin. Following SDS-PAGE, the gel was cut in half; the top portion (containing IQGAP1) was stained with Coomassie Blue and the bottom half was processed by blotting for calmodulin. Binding to calmodulin was evaluated by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography as described (24Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, after preclearing with Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with 40 μl of calmodulin-Sepharose (∼20 μg of calmodulin) (or Sepharose without calmodulin as control) and incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 3 h. The calmodulin-Sepharose was washed five times in buffer A containing either 1 mm CaC12 or 1 mm EGTA as appropriate and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.25m sucrose, and 2 mm EDTA). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and processed by immunoblotting as described above. Densitometry of ECL signals was analyzed with UNSCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific Corp.). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, using InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Protein concentrations were measured with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Initial analysis was performed with four deletion mutant IQGAP1 constructs. As previously demonstrated with endogenous IQGAP1 (24Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), transfected wild type IQGAP1 bound readily to calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 A). Deletion of the CHD or the WW domains from IQGAP1 did not significantly change its affinity for calmodulin. By contrast, deletion of all four IQ motifs (IQGAP1ΔIQ) essentially eliminated binding (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, IQGAP1ΔGRD had significantly reduced binding to calmodulin, although the region deleted is more than 200 amino acids distal to the IQ domain. The reason is not known, but is presumably because of effects on the tertiary conformation of IQGAP1. The reduced binding is not caused by total disruption of IQGAP1 structure because both IQGAP1ΔIQ (17Briggs M.W., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7453-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and IQGAP1ΔGRD (data not shown) bind to β-catenin with an affinity similar to that of wild type IQGAP1. Interestingly, the conformational “cross-talk” between the IQ and GRD regions seems to be reciprocal. We previously observed that deletion of the IQ motifs prevents Cdc42, which binds to the GRD and adjacent residues in the C-terminal half of the molecule (13Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), from co-immunoprecipitating with IQGAP1 (20Sokol S.Y., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48425-48430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Binding was specific for calmodulin as wild type IQGAP1 did not bind to Sepharose alone (Fig. 1 A). Essentially identical findings were observed in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Because deletion of all four IQ motifs abrogated the binding of IQGAP1 to calmodulin, point mutations were generated of individual residues in each IQ motif. A prior publication (26Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) indicated that substitution of Gln for the conserved Arg residues in the IQ motif of Ras-GRF prevented calmodulin binding. Moreover, binding of light chains to the IQ region of scallop myosin demonstrates that the conserved Arg residues in the IQ form important hydrogen bonds (27Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we chose to mutate to Gln the Arg residues in the IQ motifs of IQGAP1. IQ1, IQ3, and IQ4 are complete IQ motifs, whereas IQ2 is incomplete as it lacks Arg at position 11 (11) (Fig. 2). Therefore, for IQ1, IQ3, and IQ4 we mutated the two Arg (at positions 6 and 11) to Gln, whereas for IQ2 the single Arg and proximal Gln (at position 2) were replaced by Gln and Ala, respectively (Fig. 2). These constructs were termed the IQR series, because the Arg residues were mutated. Replacement of the charged Arg residues in all four IQ motifs (IQ1,2,3,4R) essentially eliminated binding to apocalmodulin (Fig. 3). To ascertain the relative contribution of individual IQ motifs to overall calmodulin binding, analysis was also performed using constructs with point mutations in single or multiple IQ motifs. Interestingly, replacement of the Arg residues in only IQ3 and IQ4 (IQ3,4R) yielded a lack of binding essentially identical to that seen with mutation of all four IQ motifs (Fig. 3). By contrast, mutation of both IQ1 and IQ2 (IQ1,2R) resulted in binding to calmodulin that was not significantly different from that of wild type IQGAP1. The constructs with mutation of IQ3 alone (IQ3R) or IQ4 alone (IQ4R) bound calmodulin with an affinity ∼50% of that seen with wild type IQGAP1, whereas mutation of IQ1 alone (IQ1R) had no effect on binding (Fig. 3). These data imply that apocalmodulin binds only to IQ3 and IQ4, with approximately equal affinity for each of the two IQ motifs. This interpretation is supported by the observation that mutation of IQ1, IQ2, and IQ4 (IQ1,2,4R) yields a construct that binds calmodulin indistinguishably from IQ4R (Fig. 3), indicating that IQ1 and IQ2 do not bind apocalmodulin. A markedly different effect was observed with Ca2+/calmodulin. Mutation of Arg residues in one, two, three, or all four IQ motifs had no significant effect on the interaction of IQGAP1 with Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 4). Ca2+/calmodulin bound to IQ1,2,3,4R IQGAP1 with the same affinity as to wild type IQGAP1. The binding properties of IQ1,2,3,4R led us to rename this construct IQGAP1·apoCaM(−). Because replacing the basic charged Arg residues in the IQ motifs with Gln failed to reduce binding to Ca2+/calmodulin, an alternative strategy was adopted. Based on the mechanism by which calmodulin recognizes target peptides in the presence of Ca2+, hydrophobic amino acids in the IQ motifs were targeted (Fig. 5 A). The prediction was that one of the lobes of calmodulin would interact with the H-1 residues, whereas the other calmodulin lobe would bind to the H-2 residues. Therefore, selected hydrophobic residues distal to the Gln (Q) of the IQ motif were mutated to Asp (Fig. 5 A). All the H-1 and the distal H-2 (at position 14) residues were mutated. These point mutant constructs are termed the QH series (H for hydrophobic). Replacement of these hydrophobic residues (at positions 5, 8, and 14) in all four IQ motifs prevented binding to apocalmodulin (Fig. 5 B). Unexpectedly, the IQGAP1 construct with all four IQ motifs mutated as described (QH) still bound to Ca2+/calmodulin, although the affinity was attenuated (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, an additional point mutation was performed in the residue immediately proximal to the Gln (the “I” of the IQ). Leu-752 in IQ1 was changed to Glu, whereas the Ile in IQ2, IQ3, and IQ4 (Ile-782, Ile-812, and Ile-842, respectively) were converted to Asp (Fig. 6 A). These constructs are termed the IQH series. Analysis of the IQ1,2,3,4H mutant with all four IQ motifs mutated revealed a complete absence of binding to apocalmodulin (Fig. 6 B). Similarly, mutation of all four IQ motifs abrogated binding to Ca2+/calmodulin. The IQ1,2,3,4H was renamed IQGAP1·CaM(−) because it does not bind calmodulin regardless of whether Ca2+ is absent or present. As previously observed (24Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), more wild type IQGAP1 bound to Ca2+/calmodulin than to apocalmodulin (Fig. 6, comparelane 1 (WT) in calmodulin-Sepharose pull-downs inpanels B and C). To verify these findings, the ability of calmodulin to bind to purified IQGAP1 was evaluated. GST fusion proteins of wild type, IQGAP1·apoCaM(−), and IQGAP1·CaM(−) were expressed in E. coli and their ability to bind endogenous calmodulin was evaluated. As seen with the calmodulin-Sepharose analysis, purified IQGAP1·CaM(−)was unable to bind calmodulin regardless of whether Ca2+was present or absent (Fig. 7 A). Moreover, consistent with the data obtained with calmodulin-Sepharose analysis, purified IQGAP1·apoCaM(−) was unable to interact with calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+, but readily bound to Ca2+/calmodulin. The presence of the GST-IQGAP1 construct in each sample was validated by probing blots for IQGAP1 (data not shown). Analysis was also performed in vitro with purified proteins. Pure calmodulin was incubated with GST fusion proteins of wild type and mutant IQGAP1 in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Congruent with the previous results, IQGAP1·CaM(−) bound no calmodulin, whereas IQGAP1·apoCaM(−) bound Ca2+/calmodulin but not apocalmodulin (Fig. 7 B). These data validate our findings and indicate that other proteins in the cell are not responsible for the altered calmodulin binding to the IQGAP1 mutants. IQ motifs, first recognized as calmodulin-binding domains in neuromodulin (7Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7544-7549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Andreasen T.J. Luetje C.W. Heideman W. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4615-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), have been identified in many proteins with a diverse array of functions (10Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). One of these is the scaffolding protein IQGAP1. In this paper, we generated two different series of point mutant constructs of the four tandem IQ motifs of IQGAP1, namely the IQR (Arg residues mutated) and IQH (hydrophobic residues mutated) series. Analysis of these constructs reveals that apocalmodulin binds to only IQ3 and IQ4, whereas Ca2+/calmodulin binds to all four IQ motifs of IQGAP1 (note that the stoichiometry of CaM:IQGAP1 is 4:1 (23Mateer S.C. McDaniel A.E. Nicolas V. Habermacher G.M. Lin M.J. Cromer D.A. King M.E. Bloom G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12324-12333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). We previously documented that Ca2+/calmodulin and apocalmodulin bind to fusion proteins of the IQ region of IQGAP1 (19Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A low affinity binding site for Ca2+/calmodulin, but not apocalmodulin, was also identified in the calponin homology domain (CHD). The CHD appears to make a small contribution to total calmodulin binding as deletion of this region did not significantly reduce the binding of IQGAP1 to calmodulin. Moreover, essentially no binding of calmodulin was detected to IQGAP1 constructs with point mutations in the IQ motifs, despite the presence of an intact CHD. X-ray and NMR structures of calmodulin bound to “classic” target peptides reveal that calmodulin is compact, with the globular domains close together, joined by a loop of the extended flexible central helix (reviewed in Ref. 6Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Whereas the classic calmodulin target peptides adopt an amphiphilic α-helical conformation (6Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 28Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), recent evidence reveals that calmodulin (and the target peptides) can adopt a variety of conformations when interacting with different targets. For example, Ca2+/calmodulin induced dimerization of the gating domain of a Ca2+-activated K+channel (4Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In this structure, the calmodulin-binding domain forms an elongated dimer with a calmodulin molecule bound at each end. In addition, when bound to anthrax adenylyl cyclase, calmodulin adopts an extended conformation (5Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q., Lu, D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), rather than the compact conformation seen with other targets. These recent surprising findings accentuate the diversity and variability in the interaction of calmodulin with its target molecules. Although IQ motifs were described 10 years ago (9Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), a detailed structure of the calmodulin-IQ complex has not yet been published. A model of calmodulin bound to an IQ motif has been constructed, using the crystal structure of the regulatory domain of scallop myosin (11Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,29Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The highly conserved portion of the IQ motif (IQXXR; the first residue may be Ile, Leu, or Val (10Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar)) is the most critical region and determines both the conformation and positioning of the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin (29Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The second part of the IQ motif core (GXXR) is not well conserved and has a minor role in fixing the position of the calmodulin N-terminal lobe. IQ motifs having both parts are termed “complete,” whereas those lacking the second part are termed “incomplete.” This distinction is important because binding of calmodulin to complete IQ motifs does not require Ca2+ (29Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The C-terminal lobe of calmodulin is expected to be semi-open and the N-terminal lobe closed when bound to a complete IQ motif. By contrast, when bound to an incomplete IQ motif, the N-terminal lobe would adopt an open conformation provided that Ca2+ is present (29Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is thought that apocalmodulin and Ca2+/calmodulin are likely to bind different sites in the IQ motif (11Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results presented here complement the model. Some of our data support the scheme, whereas other observations differ from those anticipated from the model. For example, consistent with the predictions of Houdusse and Cohen (11Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions appear to contribute to the binding of apocalmodulin and both seem necessary; disruption of either mode of association by mutation of critical residues reduces binding. The expectation from the model was that apocalmodulin would bind all the complete IQ motifs. However, our data revealed that apocalmodulin did not bind to IQ1, although it fulfills the criteria of a complete IQ motif. As indicated by our results, caution should be exercised in extrapolating data obtained with model IQ peptides because these do not always mimic the behavior of the intact protein. For example, neuromodulin and neurogranin bind calmodulin only in the absence of Ca2+, but isolated peptides of the calmodulin-binding domains bind Ca2+/calmodulin (30Apel E.D. Byford M.F., Au, D. Walsh K.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2330-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Urbauer J.L. Short J.H. Dow L.K. Wand A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, the interaction of calmodulin with the complete catalytic domain of edema factor of adenylyl cyclase was different from its interaction with the peptide of the calmodulin-binding domain; the peptide induced a conformation of calmodulin opposite to that caused by the whole catalytic domain (5Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q., Lu, D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These observations emphasize the importance of studies with intact proteins as conducted here. It is generally believed that calmodulin targets that contain IQ motifs have a higher affinity for the Ca2+-free form of calmodulin (8Andreasen T.J. Luetje C.W. Heideman W. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4615-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Wolenski J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Brockerhoff S.E. Stevens R.C. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, for some proteins such as brush border myosin I (35Wolenski J.S. Hayden S.M. Forscher P. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Ca2+ induces the dissociation of bound calmodulin. Our mutagenesis data reveal that the interaction between calmodulin and IQ motifs is substantially more complex than current thinking and selected IQ motifs may have higher affinity for Ca2+/calmodulin. This observation is supported by the reports from both our laboratory and others that the IQ-containing proteins IRS-1 (36Munshi H.G. Burks D.J. Joyal J.L. White M.F. Sacks D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15883-15889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and NinaC myosin (37Porter J.A. Minke B. Montell C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4450-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) bind Ca2+/calmodulin with higher affinity than apocalmodulin. The results presented here extend previous findings, indicating that the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to IQ motifs exhibits several features different from those of apocalmodulin. First, Ca2+/calmodulin binds to all four IQ motifs of IQGAP1, whereas apocalmodulin does not interact appreciably with the first two (IQ1 or IQ2) IQ motifs. These findings provide the molecular mechanism for our initial observation that 2-fold more IQGAP1 bound calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ (24Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Second, electrostatic interactions appear less important for Ca2+/calmodulin binding than hydrophobic interactions. Substitution of the polar but uncharged Gln for critical basic Arg residues in all four IQ motifs did not attenuate the interaction of Ca2+/calmodulin, but was sufficient to eliminate apocalmodulin binding. Third, individual hydrophobic residues have critical roles that differ between apocalmodulin and Ca2+/calmodulin. The I of the IQ motif appears to be essential for binding Ca2+/calmodulin, but has a less significant role in the interaction with apocalmodulin. Binding to apocalmodulin, but not Ca2+/calmodulin, could be eliminated without altering this Ile. This study employed direct experimentation to test models of the interaction of calmodulin with IQ motifs. Nevertheless, some caveats of our work should be borne in mind. Fourteen amino acids had to be substituted in the four IQ motifs of IQGAP1 to abrogate binding of Ca2+/calmodulin. It is conceivable that these substitutions could modify secondary or tertiary structure, thereby altering the orientation of the IQ motifs to one another or to other regions of IQGAP1. The observation that IQGAP1·apoCaM(−) and IQ1,2,3,4R IQGAP1 (which have 7 and 10 substitutions, respectively) bind to Ca2+/calmodulin with the same affinity as to wild type IQGAP1 renders this possibility less likely. It remains possible, however, that the mutant IQGAP1 could bind to calmodulin by an interaction different from that in the native protein. This premise can be eliminated only by solving the structures of wild type and mutant IQGAP1. The functional sequelae of calmodulin binding to IQ motifs remain incompletely understood. For the unconventional myosins, IQ motifs are thought to influence the chemomechanical properties of the myosins (10Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Binding of calmodulin has a substantial effect on IQGAP1, modulating its interaction with other targets (16Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Briggs M.W., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7453-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Previous analysis documented that Ca2+ is required for calmodulin to block the binding of Cdc42 to IQGAP1 (24Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), implying that Ca2+/calmodulin induces a conformation in IQGAP1 different from that produced by apocalmodulin. The findings presented here contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying these functional effects. IQ3 and IQ4 of IQGAP1 bind both apocalmodulin and Ca2+/calmodulin, whereas IQ1 and IQ2 bind only Ca2+/calmodulin. Therefore, the conformation adopted by IQGAP1 bound to Ca2+/calmodulin is likely to result from the interaction of Ca2+/calmodulin with IQ1 and/or IQ2. A second possibility is that simultaneous occupation of all four IQ motifs is necessary to eliminate Cdc42 binding. Third, Ca2+/calmodulin may interact with amino acid residues in the IQ motifs different from those recognized by apocalmodulin, inducing a different shape in IQGAP1. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and more than one may be operative. Together, the findings obtained by mutating individual residues in sequential IQ motifs in an intact protein enhance our comprehension of the molecular interactions between calmodulin and IQ motifs, as well as elucidating the modulatory role of Ca2+. We look forward to the crystal structures of IQ motifs bound to Ca2+/calmodulin and apocalmodulin to yield further insight into these important protein regulatory motifs. We are deeply indebted to Dr. Anne Houdusse (Institut Curie, Paris) for many valuable discussions and insightful suggestions regarding selection of residues for mutation. We thank Dr. Michael Briggs for expert preparation of figures, Stella Kim for generating initial results, Mark Andrews for assistance with data analysis, and Ann Marie Bynoe for manuscript preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2072725805,"Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are DNA-mimicking molecules in which the sugar-phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone composed of N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units. We determined whether double-stranded molecules based on PNAs and PNA-DNA-PNA (PDP) chimeras could be capable of stable interactions with nuclear proteins belonging to the Sp1 transcription factor family and, therefore, could act as decoy reagents able to inhibit molecular interactions between Sp1 and DNA. Since the structure of PNA/PNA hybrids is very different from that of the DNA/DNA double helix, they could theoretically alter the molecular structure of the double-stranded PNA-DNA-PNA chimeras, perturbing interactions with specific transcription factors. We found that PNA-based hybrids do not inhibit Sp1/DNA interactions. In contrast, hybrid molecules based on PNA-DNA-PNA chimeras are very effective decoy molecules, encouraging further experiments focused on the possible use of these molecules for the development of potential agents for a decoy approach in gene therapy. In this respect, the finding that PDP-based decoy molecules are more resistant than DNA/DNA hybrids to enzymatic degradation appears to be of great interest. Furthermore, their resistance can even be improved after complexation with cationic liposomes to which PDP/PDP chimeras are able to bind by virtue of their internal DNA structure. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are DNA-mimicking molecules in which the sugar-phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone composed of N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units. We determined whether double-stranded molecules based on PNAs and PNA-DNA-PNA (PDP) chimeras could be capable of stable interactions with nuclear proteins belonging to the Sp1 transcription factor family and, therefore, could act as decoy reagents able to inhibit molecular interactions between Sp1 and DNA. Since the structure of PNA/PNA hybrids is very different from that of the DNA/DNA double helix, they could theoretically alter the molecular structure of the double-stranded PNA-DNA-PNA chimeras, perturbing interactions with specific transcription factors. We found that PNA-based hybrids do not inhibit Sp1/DNA interactions. In contrast, hybrid molecules based on PNA-DNA-PNA chimeras are very effective decoy molecules, encouraging further experiments focused on the possible use of these molecules for the development of potential agents for a decoy approach in gene therapy. In this respect, the finding that PDP-based decoy molecules are more resistant than DNA/DNA hybrids to enzymatic degradation appears to be of great interest. Furthermore, their resistance can even be improved after complexation with cationic liposomes to which PDP/PDP chimeras are able to bind by virtue of their internal DNA structure. nuclear factor κB promoter-specific transcription factor Sp1 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat oligodeoxyribonucleotide peptide nucleic acid PNA-DNA-PNA chimera urokinase-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor cytosine arabinoside high pressure liquid chromatography tetralysine-cholesterol tetralysine-palmitate liposomal formulation of Lys4-Chol liposomal formulation of Lys4-Palm N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl globin In vitro transfection of cis elements that decoy against nuclear factors leads to alteration of gene expression and was recently proposed in molecular medicine as a novel tool for the possible therapy of several disorders (1–12).

In addition to proteins belonging to the NF-κB superfamily, decoy molecules for other target transcription factors, such as HNF-1, RFX1, nuclear factor YB, E2F, cAMP-response element, and Sp1, were found to be effective (1Clusel C.

As to the molecular targets for the decoy approach, proteins belonging to the Sp1 family are of great interest since these transcription factors are involved in the regulation of the expression of several genes relevant to human pathologies, including those encoding vascular endothelial growth factor, plasminogen-activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), COL1A2, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and uPA receptor (3Ishibashi H.

AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, the development of experimental approaches based on Sp1 decoys to modulate the transcription of Sp1-dependent genes appears to be of great interest (3Ishibashi H. Nakagawa K. Onimaru M. Castellanous E.J. Kaneda Y. Nakashima Y. Shirasuna K. Sueishi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6531-6536PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Ishibashi et al. (3Ishibashi H. Nakagawa K. Onimaru M. Castellanous E.J. Kaneda Y. Nakashima Y. Shirasuna K. Sueishi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6531-6536PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that transfection of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) carrying the consensus sequence for Sp1 binding (Sp1 decoy ODNs) was able to inhibit the tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor β1. These results are appealing since it is well known that the expression of these genes is an important aspect in growth and metastasis of solid tumors. In addition, it was found that the in vitroinvasiveness, synthesis of mRNA for uPA, and cell proliferation were also inhibited by the transfection of Sp1 decoy ODNs, suggesting that Sp1 decoy strategy could be effective for regulating tumor growth by reducing in cancer cell (a) angiogenic growth factor expression, (b) proliferation, and (c) invasiveness. In another report, Verrecchia et al. (21Verrecchia F. Rossert J. Mauviel A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 755-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) found that decoy Sp1-binding ODNs inhibited COL1A2promoter activity both in cultured fibroblasts and in vivo, in the skin of transgenic mice, which have integrated a mouseCOL1A2 promoter/luciferase reporter gene construct, indicating that targeting Sp1 efficiently blocks extracellular matrix gene expression, and suggest that such an approach may represent an interesting therapeutic alternative toward the treatment of fibrotic disorders. The activity of decoy molecules carrying Sp1 binding sites was also studied by Motojima et al. (22Motojima M. Ando T. Yoshioka T. Biochem.

This transcriptionally regulated receptor is a critical mediator of endothelial cell growth and vascular development (25Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol.

In PNAs, the pseudopeptide backbone is composed ofN-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units (27Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Berg R.H. Buchardt O. Science. 1991; 254: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). PNAs hybridize with high affinity to complementary sequences of single-stranded RNA and DNA, forming Watson-Crick double helices (28Egholm M. Buchardt O. Nielsen P.E. Berg R.H. J. Am. Chem.

We demonstrated that NF-κB p52 is able to bind to both DNA/DNA and DNA/PNA hybrids mimicking the NF-κB target sites present in the HIV-1 LTR. On the contrary, low binding of NF-κB p52 to PNA/PNA hybrids was found (20Mischiati C. Borgatti M. Bianchi N. Rutigliano C. Tomassetti M. Feriotto G. Gambari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33114-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have also reported a conformational study to explain these binding data using a molecular dynamics approach. These data have underlined that the loss of charged phosphate groups and the different shape of the helix in PNA/DNA and PNA/PNA hybrids drastically reduce binding efficiency to NF-κB transcription factor (31Saviano M.

More recently, PNA-DNA chimeras have been described as reagents of great interest in gene therapy. PNA-DNA chimeras are PNA-DNA (30Gambari R. Curr. Pharm.

Finally, PNA-DNA chimeras in which the PNA part is attached to 3′- or 5′-ends of the DNA are expected to be particularly stable against degradation by 3′- and/or 5′-exonucleases, which represent the major type of oligonucleotide degrading enzymes found in serum (30Gambari R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1839-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present report, we determined whether PNA/PNA and PNA/DNA hybrid could act as decoy molecules for transcription factor Sp1. Furthermore, we investigated binding to Sp1 transcription factor(s) and biological activity of PNA-DNA-PNA chimeras mimicking Sp1 binding sites. The synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. HPLC-purified PNAs were purchased from ISOGEN Biosciences (Maarssen, the Netherlands). Chimera synthesis proceeded by sequential elongation of the PNA fragment, to which DNA first and then PNA were attached. Aminomethyl-polystiren-NH2 resin (loading 37 μmol/g), resin functionalized with an hexamethylene bisacetamide linker bound through an ester bond to a Gly, was used. The DNA part of the chimera was prepared on anAmersham Biosciences Gene Assembler. Chain elongation was performed with 15 eq of methyl DNA phosphoramidites using 5-(o-nitrophenyl)tetrazole (8 eq) as the activator. Standard DNA capping, washing, oxidation, and detritylation cycles were used. Coupling yields were gauged spectrophotometrically (254 nm) by the absorption of the released trityl cation after each deprotection step. In the last DNA elongation step, cyanoethyl 5-amino-5-deoxythymidine phosphoramidite was used (38van der Laan A.C. Havenaar P. Oosting R.S. Kuyl-Yeheskiely E. Uhlmann E. van Boom J.H. Bioorg. Med.

The PNA part of the chimera was prepared on a full automated PerSeptive Biosystems Expedite 8900 Nucleic Acid synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using standard (designed for 2-μmol scale) PNA coupling cycles and solutions. Fmoc (Bz, benzyl)/(iBu, isobutyl)-protected PNA was used. To improve the coupling efficiency of the first PNA moiety, a double coupling cycle was employed (40Thomson S.A. Josey J.A. Cadilla R. Gaul M.D. Hassman C.F. Luzzio M.J. Pipe A.J. Reed K.L. Ricca D.J. Wiethe R.W. Noble S.A. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 6179-6194Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Upon completion of the last elongation cycle, the terminal Fmoc group was cleaved by piperidine treatment, and the primary amine was acetylated. The methyl groups were removed from the phosphate functions by treatment of the resin with 0.25 ml of thiophenol in 0.5 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 0.5 ml of triethylamine for 45 min. The resin was washed consecutively with tetrahydrofuran, methanol, acetonitrile, and water (5 × 1 ml for each solvent). The oligomers were cleaved from the support with concomitant deprotection of the remaining protective groups by treatment with 0.1 m sodium hydroxide in water/dioxane (1/1, v/v, 1.5 ml) at 55 °C for 16 h. The reaction mixtures were neutralized by the addition of acetic acid, concentrated, and redissolved in 0.15 m ammonium bicarbonate. Desalting was performed using a Sephadex G-25 (superfine, DNA grade) gel filtration column with 0.15 m ammonium bicarbonate buffers. Samples were filtered and then purified by reverse-phase-HPLC on a LiCrosphere 100 RP-18 endcapped column (4 × 250 mm) on a Jasco HPLC system. Gradient elution was performed at 40 °C, building up gradient starting with buffer A (50 mm triethylammonium acetate in water) and applying buffer B (50 mmtriethylammonium acetate in acetonitrile/water 1/1 v/v) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analyses were performed on all chimeras as follows: (a) 5842.6 (M+H)+ and (b) 5602.0 (M+H)+; (a) cag- *TGA GGC GTG GCCA -ggg-Gly and (b) ccc- *TGG CCACGC CTCA -ctg-Gly.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) was performed using the double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides mimicking the Sp1 (nucleotide sequences are presented in Table I and in Fig.1). The DNA stretches of the target molecules were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas, Milano, Italy) in the case of DNA/DNA, DNA/PNA, and DNA/PDP hybrids. 32P-labeled PDP/PDP molecules were obtained by nick translation, using low concentrations (0.1–0.01 units/reaction) of DNase I and [α-32P]dCTP. Binding reactions were set up as described elsewhere (43Bianchi N. Osti F. Rutigliano C. Ginanni Corradini F. Borsetti E. Tomassetti M. Mischiati C. Feriotto G. Gambari R. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 25 μl of binding buffer plus 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 ng of32P-labeled oligonucleotides. 12 μg of crude nuclear extracts isolated from human cell lines were used, and the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of 1 μg of the nonspecific competitor poly(dIdC)·poly(dIdC) (43Bianchi N. Osti F. Rutigliano C. Ginanni Corradini F. Borsetti E. Tomassetti M. Mischiati C. Feriotto G. Gambari R. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After 20 min of binding at room temperature, the samples were electrophoresed at constant voltage (200 V) under low ionic strength conditions (0.25× TBE buffer = 22 mm Tris borate, 0.4 mm EDTA) on 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and subjected to standard autoradiographic procedures (43Bianchi N. Osti F. Rutigliano C. Ginanni Corradini F. Borsetti E. Tomassetti M. Mischiati C. Feriotto G. Gambari R. Br. J.

In competition experiments, the competitor molecules carrying HIV-1 Sp1 binding sites (DNA/DNA, PNA/PNA, DNA/PNA, PDP/PDP, and DNA/PDP) were preincubated for 20 min with nuclear extracts, before the addition of labeled target DNA.

Cell growth was studied by determining the cell number/ml after different days of in vitro cell culture (46Bianchi N. Ongaro F. Chiarabelli C. Gualandi L. Mischiati C. Bergamini P. Gambari R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of ara-C (100 μm) were stored at −20 °C in the dark and diluted immediately before use. Treatment with the indicated concentrations of DNA- and PNA-based molecules was carried out by adding the appropriate concentrations of the compounds at the beginning of the experiment (cells were usually seeded at 30,000 cells/ml). The medium was not changed during the induction period. K562 cells containing heme or hemoglobin were detected by specific reaction with a benzidine/hydrogen peroxide solution as reported elsewhere (45Gambari R. del Senno L. Barbieri R. Viola L.

The stability of decoy molecules was evaluated after incubation of DNA and PNA-DNA-PNA-based decoys with 3′ → 5′-exonuclease III, 5′ → 3′-λ-exonuclease, and DNase I. ExoIII, λ-exonuclease, and DNase I were purchased from MBI Fermentas (ExoIII and λ-exonucleases) and Promega Corp., Madison, WI (DNase I). In addition, serum (fetal calf serum, Eurobio, 30 g/liter of protein concentration) was also employed. After incubation with increasing amounts of the enzymes (for 10 min in the case of ExoIII, for 30 min in the case of λ-exonuclease and DNase I), the decoy molecules were layered on the top of a 2% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Disappearance of the decoy molecule was considered as an evidence of degradation by the employed enzymes. Results were presented as percentage of recovery with respect to control untreated reaction mixtures. Egg phosphatidyl choline was purchased from Lipid Products (Surrey, England). Tetralysine cationic lipids, tetralysine-cholesterol (Lys4-Chol), and tetralysine-palmitate (Lys4-Palm) were a generous gift of Prof. M. Marastoni (Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy). Positively charged liposomes were produced by a protocol based on reverse phase evaporation followed by extrusion of the liposome suspension through polycarbonate filters with homogeneous pore size. Liposomes were subjected to one extrusion cycle through two stacked 400-nm pore size filters followed by three extrusion cycles through two stacked 200-nm pore size membranes in order to obtain unilamellar liposomes with a homogeneous size distribution. Different cationic detergents were alternatively used for the production of the liposomes, namely Lys4-Chol and Lys4-Palm (47Nastruzzi C. Cortesi R. Esposito E. Gambari R. Borgatti M. Bianchi N.

The resulting liposomal formulations were named as follows: lipo-Lys4-Chol and lipo-Lys4-Palm. The morphological and dimensional analysis of the produced liposomes was performed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy technique and photo correlation spectroscopy (Zetasizer, Malvern, UK). The freeze-fracture electron micrographs (47Nastruzzi C. Cortesi R. Esposito E. Gambari R. Borgatti M. Bianchi N. Feriotto G. Mischiati C. J.

Rudnicki M.A. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), but the molecular events that regulate their quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation during cellular growth and regeneration remain poorly defined. The forkhead/winged helix (Fox) transcription factor family is characterized by a 100-amino acid winged helix DNA binding domain and has been shown to play essential roles during embryogenesis and in the control of cellular proliferation/determination in adult progenitor cell populations (4Kaufmann E.

We have identified a novel member of theforkhead/winged helix transcription factor family, termed Foxk1 (previously referred to as myocyte nuclear factor or MNF) (14Garry D.J. Yang Q. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 280-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,15Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Foxk1 is expressed early, selectively, and transiently in the developing neural tube, heart, and somites of the mouse embryo. However, during the latter stages of embryogenesis and in the adult, Foxk1 is restricted to a subpopulation of mononuclear cells within the skeletal muscle, which were identified as myogenic satellite (progenitor) cells (14Garry D.J. Yang Q. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 280-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Importantly, Foxk1 was the first selective molecular marker of the quiescent myogenic progenitor cell population. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that mice lacking Foxk1 (Foxk1−/−) exhibit a growth deficiency and a severe impairment in skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. The mechanistic defect associated with the impaired skeletal muscle regeneration in Foxk1 mutant mice is the focus of the current work. Overall, it was hypothesized that dysregulation, or loss, of Foxk1 attenuates skeletal muscle growth and regeneration due to an impairment of the cell cycle regulatory genes within the myogenic progenitor cell population. The data presented here establish Foxk1 as an important regulator of the myogenic progenitor cell population and provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21CIP, is a downstream target of Foxk1. Foxk1−/− (15Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Combinatorial mating of Foxk1−/− and p21CIP−/− mice was undertaken to generate mice lacking both Foxk1 and p21CIP. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using the following primer pairs: Foxk1 wild type allele, For 5′-CAAAGTCCCTCGGTCCCAGGAGG-3′ and Rev 5′-GCGGAAGCAGGAGACACCTCTCTG-3′; Foxk1 mutant allele, For 5′-CCTCCGAGCAGCAAGCAGATGCG-3′ and Rev 5′-GCTTCTGAGGAGAGAACTGGCTGAG-3′; p21CIP wild type allele, For 5′-GGCTGAACTCAACACCCACCT-3′ and Rev 5′-GAGACAACGGCACACTTTGCTC-3′; p21CIP mutant allele, For 5′-GGCTGAACTCAACACCCACCT-3′ and Rev 5′-GCTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGGC-3′. Thermocycler conditions for p21CIP are: step 1, 94 °C for 4 min; step 2, 94 °C for 1 min; step 3, 62 °C for 1 min; step 4, 72 °C for 1.5 min; 5) 72 °C for 3 min. Steps 2–4 are repeated for 40 cycles. Thermocycler conditions for Foxk1 are: step 1) 94 °C for 2 min; step 2, 94 °C for 15 s; step 3, 62 °C for 15 s; step 4, 72 °C for 15 s; step 5, 72 °C for 3 min. Steps 2–4 are repeated for 30 cycles. Asynchronously dividing primary myogenic progenitor cell cultures were harvested from hindlimb skeletal muscle of neonatal (2-day-old) mice (16Pavlath G. Jones G.E. Methods of Molecular Medicine: Human Cell Culture Protocols. Humana Press, Totawa, NJ1996: 307-318Google Scholar). Cells were preplated and grown on collagen coated plates in F-10 growth medium (20% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% penicillin/streptomyocin, 25 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor). In selected experiments, IGF-I (50 ng/ml) or WT conditioned medium was added to the growth medium of WT and Foxk1−/− cells and further cultured for 4 days. Single skeletal muscle fibers were harvested from the fast twitch extensor digitorum longus muscles of 2–4-month-old mice (17Rosenblatt J.D. Lunt A.L. Parry D.J. Partridge T.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 18Bockhold K. Rosenblatt J.D. Partridge T.A. Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After 72 h in culture, the number of myogenic progenitor cells that had migrated from the fiber were quantified. Fast twitch tibialis anterior muscles from 2–4-month-old WT, Foxk1−/− and Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− mice were harvested following perfusion fixation with 3% gluteraldehyde. Samples were post-fixed with buffered 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with ethanol, embedded in Spurr resin, and polymerized overnight at 60 °C. Sections (80 nm) were suspended on 200-mesh copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using a JEOL 1200EXII transmission electron microscope. Myogenic progenitor cells and myonuclei were identified and quantified according to criteria described previously (2Schultz E. McCormick K.M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 123: 213-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was performed using 2 μl of cDNA and the Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) on a Bio-Rad iCycler. Semiquantitative RT-PCR (using 1:10 and 1:50 dilutions of cDNA) was also performed under conditions in which the abundance of each amplified cDNA varied linearly with input RNA to confirm the results of Real-time PCR. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using cDNA (1 μl) as a template for the PCR reaction in a 25-μl reaction volume including 40 ng of each primer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 μl, 10×Taq buffer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Thermocycler conditions were: step 1) 96 °C for 2 min; step 2, 96 °C for 15 s; step 3, 62 °C for 30 s; step 4, 72 °C for 30 s; step 5, 72 °C for 10 min. Steps 2–4 were repeated for 30 cycles.

Western analysis of protein extracts isolated from wild type or Foxk1−/− progenitor cell cultures was performed as described previously using rabbit anti-p21 or rabbit anti-p53 sera (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) (15Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Primary myogenic progenitor cell cultures from WT, Foxk1−/−, p21CIP−/−, and Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− skeletal muscle were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated with a propidium iodide staining solution (1.8 mg/ml RNase A, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide) for ∼3 h to label DNA. Using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) flow cytometer, 10,000+ cells were sorted based on DNA content. The data were processed and the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle quantified using Cellquest Software (BD Biosciences). To assess cellular proliferation, primary myogenic progenitor cells grown on collagen coated coverslips were incubated for 7 h with 10 μm BrdUrd. Following incubation, cells were fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal serum (as per the supplier's instructions, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were co-stained with propidium iodide (50 ng/ml) to label all nuclei. Cellular proliferation was quantified as a percentage of BrdUrd-positive (proliferating cells) to propidium iodide-positive nuclei (total cells). Gastrocnemius muscles from WT, Foxk1−/−, and Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− mice (2-month-old) were injected with cardiotoxin (150 μl/muscle of 10 μm cardiotoxin (Naja nigricollis;Calbiochem)) (15Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Muscles were harvested 10 days post-injection and fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hemotoxylin/eosin to assess the skeletal muscle fiber architecture. Student's t tests were performed to test for significant differences in data obtained from WT and Foxk1−/− or Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− mice. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise noted. The impaired skeletal muscle regeneration observed in Foxk1−/− skeletal muscle directed the initial analysis to examine the resident myogenic progenitor cell population in WT and Foxk1 mutant mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that, although Foxk1−/− skeletal muscle possesses a resident myogenic progenitor cell (satellite cell) population (Fig. 1 a), the quantity of myogenic progenitor cells is significantly decreased by 71% compared with age/sex-matched WT mice (2.86 ± 0.05% in WT versus0.84 ± 0.05% in Foxk1−/−; n = 3 for each group; p < 0.05; Fig. 1 c). Single fiber myogenic progenitor cell quantitation also demonstrated a 73% reduction in the number of myogenic progenitor cells migrating from Foxk1−/− fibers compared with gender and size-matched WT fibers following 72 h in culture (104 ± 10 in WT (n= 19) versus 29 ± 6 in Foxk1−/− (n = 29); p < 0.05; Fig. 1, b and c). These results support the hypothesis that Foxk1 is an important regulatory factor of the myogenic progenitor cell population. To examine the mechanism associated with the reduced myogenic progenitor cell number in the absence of Foxk1, we compared the cell cycle profile of WT and Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells using FACS analysis. Loss of Foxk1 disrupts cell cycle progression, causing an increase in G0/G1 cells and a concomitant decrease in S and G2/M cells as indicated by the DNA content of the cells (Fig. 1 d). Furthermore, the proliferative capacity of the Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cell population, as determined by BrdUrd incorporation, was decreased by ∼50% compared with the WT myogenic progenitor cell cultures (43 ± 0.5% in the WT, n = 6 versus 22 ± 0.5% in the Foxk1−/−, n = 8; p < 0.05). These results establish that Foxk1 is involved in the cell cycle process, since myogenic progenitor cells lacking Foxk1 show perturbed cell cycle progression and decreased proliferative capacity. To ascertain whether the impaired cell cycle progression of the Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells is the result of intrinsic or extrinsic factors, Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells were exposed to WT conditioned medium or IGF-I. IGF-I was chosen as it has been shown to modulate the transcriptional activity and cell cycle control of other forkhead/winged helix transcription factors and influence the G1/S cell cycle progression (19Chakravarthy M.V. Davis B.S. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if the cell cycle defect in the absence of Foxk1 was the result of impaired extrinsic cues, then exposure of Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells to WT conditioned medium or IGF-I should rescue the cell cycle perturbation (i.e.G0/G1 arrest). Neither WT conditioned medium (n = 3) nor IGF-I (n = 5) was capable of rescuing the G0/G1 arrest observed in the Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells (Fig. 1 d), supporting the hypothesis that the cell cycle perturbation in Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells is the result of intrinsic rather than extrinsic defects or cues. As these data supported a cell autonomous perturbation of cell cycle progression in the Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cell population, we examined the transcriptional profile of cell cycle regulatory genes to identify putative candidates responsible for the G0/G1 arrest. Real-time RT-PCR, semiquantitative RT-PCR, and Western analyses revealed a significant up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21CIP, independent of changes in other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p53, p27, or p57 (Fig. 2, a–c)). A significant decrease in cdk1 in the absence of Foxk1 was also observed. The decrease in cdk1 expression is consistent with the hypothesis that Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells are arrested at the G0/G1 phase. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that Foxk1 regulates cell cycle progression and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21CIP, in the myogenic progenitor cells. We hypothesized that the up-regulation of p21CIP expression was responsible for the observed G0/G1 arrest in the Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells. The G0/G1 arrest would ultimately result in the growth retardation of Foxk1−/− mice, since myogenic progenitor cells are required to maintain muscle mass, even in the absence of overt muscle injury. We therefore undertook a combinatorial mating of the Foxk1−/− with p21CIP-deficient mice to generate progeny lacking both Foxk1 and p21CIP (Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/−) and determine whether we could rescue the defects observed in the Foxk1 mutant myogenic progenitor cells. Quantitation of myogenic progenitor cell number using electron microscopy revealed that mice lacking both Foxk1 and p21CIPhad a normal compliment of myogenic progenitor cells, restoring the decreased number of myogenic progenitor cells in the Foxk1−/− skeletal muscle (2.76 ± 0.9% in Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− versus 0.84 + 0.05% in Foxk1−/−). The rescued myogenic progenitor cell number in the Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− skeletal muscle was further corroborated using single fiber myogenic progenitor cell quantitation (Fig. 3 a). FACS analysis of the Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− myogenic progenitor cells demonstrated that the lack of p21CIPexpression in Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells prevents the G0/G1 arrest observed in the Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cell alone (Fig. 3 b). Cell cycle analysis of the p21CIP−/− myogenic progenitor cells did not reveal a significantly enhanced cell cycle progression, which is in agreement with other published reports (20Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An increase in cellular proliferation of the double mutant myogenic progenitor cell was also observed using BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 3, c andd). The percentage of BrdUrd-positive nuclei in the Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− was significantly greater than that observed in the Foxk1−/− myogenic progenitor cells (Fig. 3 d), reaching values comparable with that observed in WT myogenic progenitor cells. We conclude that myogenic progenitor cells lacking Foxk1 have an increase in p21CIP resulting in an impaired cell cycle progression. Foxk1−/− mice are grossly smaller than gender-matched WT littermates at all ages (15Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

No significant differences were noted between the gross size of the adult age and gender-matched WT, Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− and p21CIP−/− mice. The rescue of both the cell cycle defect in the myogenic progenitor cell population and the growth deficit observed in the Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− mice prompted us to examine the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle deficient for both Foxk1 and p21CIP. Ten days following cardiotoxin-induced skeletal muscle injury in WT mice, skeletal muscle architecture is largely restored. In contrast, Foxk1−/− mice manifest a myonecrotic response that persists more than 3 weeks following the injury (15Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The impairment in Foxk1−/− skeletal muscle regeneration is completely rescued in mice lacking both Foxk1 and p21CIP with restoration of the skeletal muscle architecture within 10 days of injury comparable with that observed in WT mice (Fig. 4 b). Elegant studies have challenged previously established paradigms by demonstrating that adult stem cells have a broad capacity or plasticity and are capable of contributing to multiple lineages when placed in a permissive environment (3Asakura A. Komaki M. Rudnicki M.A. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 21Fuchs E. Segre J.A.

In recent years, cellular augmentation therapy has been pursued using alternative adult stem cell populations, including myogenic stem (progenitor) cells, to repopulate the failing heart and myopathic skeletal muscle (23Grounds M.D. White J.D. Rosenthal N. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 589-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Partridge T.A. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 21: S939-S942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studies utilizing the transfer of myogenic progenitor cells for the treatment of debilitating myopathies and congestive heart failure have unfortunately yielded disappointing results. Successful utilization of these adult stem cell/progenitor cell populations for therapeutic applications requires an understanding of the molecular regulation and cell cycle control of these rare and unique cell populations. Myogenic progenitor cells are arrested at an early stage of the myogenic program, such that they do not express any of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins of the MyoD family (25Feldman J.L. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E.

Although a number of studies have examined the physiological responses of these adult muscle progenitor cells to various stimuli, the molecular signals governing their proliferative and differentiation capacity remain poorly defined (4Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 25Feldman J.L. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Hawke T.

We have previously established that Foxk1 is restricted to the myogenic progenitor cell population in adult skeletal muscle and is the first molecular marker for this quiescent cell population (14Garry D.J. Yang Q. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 280-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study, we establish that Foxk1 is necessary for the normal complement of quiescent myogenic progenitor cells that reside in adult skeletal muscle. In the absence of Foxk1 only a small subpopulation of myogenic progenitor cells are established, and they have perturbed cell cycle progression. This defect in myogenic progenitor cell number and cell cycle progression results in the muscle regeneration deficit observed in Foxk1-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that Foxk1 plays a critical role during muscle development and during muscle regeneration in the adult mouse. The exquisitely ordered, functional regulation of the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle is determined by a balance between positive and negative regulatory pathways. The principle control of cell cycle progression is mediated through the regulation of the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases by both cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory proteins. p21CIP is an important cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that functions, in part, to regulate the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle. Expression of the p21CIP gene is induced by a wide range of cell growth regulatory signals, including p53-dependent (e.g. DNA damage) and by p53-independent mechanisms during normal tissue development or cellular differentiation (31Datto M., Li, Y. Panus J. Howe D. Xiong Y. Wang X. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 32Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Transgenic overexpression of p21CIP in the adult murine hepatocyte was shown to result in a perturbed cell cycle progression during hepatocyte regeneration, a runted liver, and a significant growth deficit of the animal (33Wu H. Wade M. Krall L. Grisham J. Xiong Y. VanDyke T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Notably, this is a similar phenotype to that observed in the Foxk1−/− mouse model. Here we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that in the absence of Foxk1, p21CIP expression is up-regulated, resulting in a G0/G1 arrest in the myogenic progenitor cell population under growth promoting conditions. The conclusion that Foxk1 regulates the myogenic progenitor cell population and modulates cell cycle progression is further based on the rescue of the growth deficit, decreased myogenic progenitor cell number, and cell cycle perturbation in mice that are deficient in both Foxk1 and p21CIP. Mice that are genetically deficient for p21CIP are viable but are radiation-sensitive, and their cells display impaired p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage (34Komarova E.A. Christov K. Faerman A.I. Gudkov A.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3791-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cultures of p21CIP null embryonic fibroblasts reveal a mild decrease in G1 length with less than a 5% decrease in G1 cells (20Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). While no skeletal muscle defects have been previously reported in the absence of a single cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, mice lacking both p21CIPand p57 have severe defects in skeletal myogenesis characterized by the failure to form differentiated myotubes (32Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These results support the essential role of coordinated cell cycle regulation for myoblast proliferation and differentiation during myogenesis (32Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the present study, we hypothesized that the growth retardation in Foxk1−/− mice reflected a defect in the function of the myogenic progenitor cell population, since myogenic progenitor cells are required to maintain muscle mass, even in the absence of overt muscle injury. In the present study, we provide data to support this hypothesis as mice lacking both Foxk1 and p21CIP resulted in a rescue of the growth deficit observed in Foxk1 mutant mice. In addition, doubly mutant mice have normalized both the myogenic progenitor cell number and cell cycle progression. The conclusion that Foxk1 is an important regulator of the myogenic progenitor cell population is further based on the rescue of chemical induced muscle injury in Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− mice. Cardiotoxin-induced injury results in an extensive myonecrotic response (>80% of the muscle is destroyed) followed by a predictable, reproducible, and rapid repair process within 10 days of the injury (15Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The regenerative response of both WT and Foxk1−/−:p21CIP−/− muscle is indistinguishable, as normal skeletal muscle architecture was observed within 10 days of injury. In contrast, the Foxk1 mutant mice have a severe impairment in muscle regeneration with ineffectual repair even 3 weeks following injury due to the defect in the myogenic progenitor cell population. These results establish Foxk1 as an important cell cycle regulator of the myogenic progenitor cell and supports the hypothesis that p21CIP is a downstream target of Foxk1. Furthermore, preliminary studies undertaken in our laboratory have identified a Foxk1 binding motif within one of three evolutionarily conserved regions of the p21CIP promoter (the other two regions are p53 binding sites). Additional studies are under way that will further examine the transcriptional regulation of the p21CIP gene by Foxk1. Members of the forkhead/winged helix family have a signature motif that encodes a DNA binding domain and function as transcription factors to exert important regulatory functions during development (i.e. cell specification and lineage segregation) and with respect to stem cells and/or tissue repair (4Kaufmann E.

Massague J. Xuan S. Lai E. Mol. Cell.

Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Other forkhead/winged helix proteins have also been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression through interactions with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. For example, overexpression of AFX (FOXO4) in multiple cell lines results in a G1 arrest of the cell cycle, which is dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibtor p27 (37Medema R.H. Kops G.J.P.L. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the tumor-suppressing role of PTEN is mediated through antagonization of the action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B on FKHR (FOXO1a) and FKHR-L1 (FOXO3a). Both PTEN and activated FKHR/FKHR-L1 were demonstrated to induce expression of p27 while having no effect of p21CIP (8Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Our current data concerning Foxk1, however, provide direct evidence for a specific role in the regulation of the cell cycle for members of this extended gene family in the regulation of progenitor (or stem) cell function. In summary, these studies establish a functional role for Foxk1 in the regulation of the myogenic progenitor cell population and support the hypothesis that p21CIP is a downsteam target gene. These studies further provide a mechanistic understanding of the regulation of the myogenic progenitor cells and will advance the use of cell transfer technologies for therapeutic applications in the treatment of myopathies.

Obligate intracellular protozoa of the phylum Apicomplexa are highly sophisticated secretory cells. Although the host cell type and the nature of the intracellular vacuole differ whenPlasmodium, Toxoplasma,Cryptosporidium, Eimeria, Theileria, and Babesia are compared, these organisms share common secretory organelles: micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. Differential secretion from these organelles directs invasion of host cells, formation of an intracellular parasitophorous vacuole, and subsequent modification of the vacuole for replication (reviewed in Ref. 1Ngô H.M. Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Most unique morphologically and biochemically are the rhoptries. These are flask-shaped secretory organelles that are assembled and positioned at the apical pole of the invasive forms of Apicomplexa (reviewed in Refs. 2Sam-Yellowe T.Y. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 308-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3Preiser P. Kaviratne M. Khan S. Bannister L. Jarra W.

Parasitology. 2000; 121: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At the onset of host cell invasion, prepackaged proteins and membranous materials from rhoptries are secreted through an apical opening. Rhoptry constituents are likely involved in a plethora of essential functions. These include directing host cell attachment and invasion (3Preiser P. Kaviratne M. Khan S. Bannister L. Jarra W. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), expansion and maintenance of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane surrounding the intracellular parasite (5Hakansson S. Charron A.J. Sibley L.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 300-339Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and attachment of host mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (6Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rhoptry proteins are targets of the normal immune response; antibodies to rhoptry proteins block invasion; and immunization with selected rhoptry proteins provides partial protection against parasite challenge (2Sam-Yellowe T.Y. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 308-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hence, the unique rhoptry organelle can serve as a potential target for blocking parasite invasion and growth. The biogenesis and phylogenetic relationship of rhoptries to secretory organelles in other cells are not well understood. Rhoptries and pre-rhoptries are described as the only acidified organelles in the parasite (7Shaw M.K. Roos D.S. Tilney L.G. Parasitology. 1998; 117: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and are packaged with specialized hydrolases (8Que X. Ngô H.M. Lawton J. Gray M. Liu Q. Engel J. Brinen L. Ghosh P.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that an endocytic tyrosine-based motif (YXXΦ) in the cytoplasmic tail of therhoptry protein ROP2, when mutated, inhibits delivery of the protein to rhoptries (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mutant ROP2 protein accumulates in a compartment of unknown origin, but distinct from the Golgi. Taken together, these results suggest that rhoptries may be analogous to secretory lysosomes. Another implication of these results is that heterotetrameric adaptin complexes (reviewed in Refs. 9Stewart M.J. Schulman S. Vanderberg J.P. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1986; 35: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Owen D.J. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, and 15Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) are potentially involved in protein sorting to rhoptries. In other eukaryotes, tyrosine-based (YXXΦ) or dileucine-based (LL) motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane receptors are recognized by the medium μ or β subunit, respectively, of heterotetrameric adaptin complexes. In turn, adaptins bind clathrin and induce the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (16Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T.

The six AP (adaptor protein) complexes (AP-1A/AP-1B, AP-2, AP-3A/AP-3B, and AP-4) are distributed to different organelles in the cell, defining their specific function and cargo selection (15Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). AP-2 mediates endocytosis from the plasma membrane, whereas AP-1A/AP-1B, AP-3A/AP-3B, and AP-4 sort proteins at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; Tgμ1, T. gondii μ1 chain; HA, hemagglutinin and/or endosomes. Although AP-1 was originally suggested to function only in anterograde transport from the TGN to endosomes, recent evidence suggests that the complex mediates retrograde transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from endosomes to the TGN (19Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Meyer C. Eskelinen E.L. Guruprasad M.R. von Figura K. Schu P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4469-4476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In neuroendocrine, endocrine, and mammary epithelial cells, AP-1 is localized to immature secretory granules, where it functions in the removal of membranes and nonspecific cargo, presumably via a retrograde pathway, to facilitate maturation to mature secretory granules (21Pauloin A. Tooze S.A. Michelutti I. Delpal S. Ollivier-Bousquet M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4089-4100PubMed Google Scholar,22Austin C. Boehm M. Tooze S.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4669-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). AP-3 mediates direct transport of selected cargo from the TGN to lysosome-like secretory organelles and may also mediate transport from endosomes to lysosome-like organelles (reviewed in Ref. 12Luzio J.P.

In contrast, there is no evidence supporting a role for AP-1 in anterograde transport from a post-Golgi compartment to another organelle and especially to a lysosome-like organelle. On both a functional and genomic basis, it is increasingly clear that the Toxoplasma gondii secretory pathway can be considered a stripped-down version of the more complicated machinery present in higher eukaryotes (24Joiner K.A. Roos D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Pelletier L. Stern C.A. Pypaert M. Sheff D. Ngô H.M. Roper N. He C.Y. Hu K. Toomre D. Coppens I. Roos D.S.

Coupled with the presence of multiple distinct and easily recognized secretory organelles, the parasite permits insight into processes not readily discerned in other systems. We now show that rhoptry proteins are transported to mature rhoptries from a post-Golgi endocytic compartment in an AP-1-dependent fashion. Other adaptins and adaptors, including AP-3, GGA proteins, stonins, and β-arrestins (reviewed in Ref. 26Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2907-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), cannot participate because they are absent from the T. gondii genome. This result substantially expands the role for AP-1 in anterograde transport and more specifically in transport to and biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. A cDNA clone (zz38e01) with strong homology to the mouse μ1A chain was located in the T. gondii expressed sequence tag data base (27Ajioka J.W. Boothroyd J.C. Brunk B.P. Hehl A. Hillier L.

The clone was found to contain the 117 C-terminal codons of a T. gondii μ1 homolog, which we designated Tgμ1. The sequence of the clone was extended by PCR from parasite cDNA using degenerate primers to the conserved sequence YELLDE (amino acids 113–118 of the mouse μ1A sequence), and full-length Tgμ1 was finally obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends from T. gondiicDNA. The Tgμ1 cDNA sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank under accession number AY117037.T. gondii and human foreskin fibroblast DNAs were isolated as previously described (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers of adaptin sequences used for the sequence analysis in Fig. 2 are as follows:Arabidopsis thaliana μ1 (AF009631), μ2 (AC007354.2), and μ4 (AL035356.1); Saccharomyces cerevisiae μ1 (NC_001148.1), μ2 (NC_001147.1), and μ3 (NC_001134.1); Caenorhabditis elegans μ1 (P35602) and μ2 (B49837); Drosophila melanogaster μ1 (AJ006219.1) and μ2 (AJ005962.1); ray Discopyge omnata μ2 (I50530); mouse μ1A (NMOO7456.1), μ1B (AF067146.1), and μ2 (I49327); rat μ2 (I49327), μ3A (L07074.1), and μ3B (L07073.1); and human μ1B (NM005498.1), μ2 (D63475.1), μ3A (AF092092.1), and μ4 (AF155158.1). The ROP2 cytoplasmic tail contains a dileucine motif at residues 529 and 530, 10 residues upstream of the YXXΦ motif previously implicated in rhoptry protein transport. An L529A/L530A mutation was introduced into the cytoplasmic tail of ROP2 using the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ROP2 construct previously described (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This construct was transiently transfected into T. gondiiand localized as previously reported (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Tgμ1 coding region was subcloned into a pZT28a vector (Amersham Biosciences) to produce a His-Tgμ1 recombinant protein. His-Tgμ1 was purified on a column and sent to Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. for production of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. The antiserum (anti-Tgμ1) was affinity-purified by adsorption and desorption to isolated recombinant proteins on nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (28Ngô H.M. Bouck G.B. J. Euk. Microbiol. 1998; 45: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified antiserum recognized a polypeptide migrating at ∼47 kDa upon immunoblotting. The growth conditions and transient and stable transfection of the RH strain of T. gondii grown on monolayers of Vero cells and human foreskin fibroblasts were as described previously (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The complete coding region of Tgμ1 was amplified by PCR and cloned in the antisense orientation into the AvrII and EcoRI sites of the ribozyme-histone cassette pNTPRZ (29Nakaar V. Samuel B.U. Ngo E.O. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5083-5087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transfection, selection, and cloning of antisense clones were done as previously described (29Nakaar V. Samuel B.U. Ngo E.O. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5083-5087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An HA epitope tag was introduced into Tgμ1 between codons 231 and 232 by PCR, yielding Tgμ1-HA. (Addition of a c-Myc epitope tag at the N terminus of Tgμ1 resulted in a protein that was diffusely cytosolic and was presumed not to be incorporated into an adaptin complex.) D176A and W415A mutations were introduced in Tgμ1-HA by PCR, yielding Tgμ1(D176A)-HA and Tgμ1(W415A)-HA. These mutations have previously been shown to alter binding of rat μ2 to tyrosine-containing motifs without affecting incorporation of the μ2 chain into the AP-2 complex (30Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Both Tgμ1-HA and Tgμ1(D176A)-HA were ligated into pNTP/Sec for transient transfection and into pDHFR-TS/C3M2M3 for stable transfection as described previously (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Sequences of all PCR-amplified fragments were verified by dideoxy sequencing at the W. M. Keck Sequencing Center of the Yale University School of Medicine. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (31Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Reddy A. Dubremetz J.-F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using anti-Tgμ1 antibody (1:100), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:200), or anti-ROP2/3/4 monoclonal antibody T3-4A7 (1:250). Antibody binding was detected by incubation with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation followed previously described protocols (32Soldalti D. Lassen A. Dubremetz J.-F. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence localization of endogenous Tgμ1 using affinity-purified anti-Tgμ1 antibody (1:20) followed a published protocol (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Reddy A. Dubremetz J.-F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Tgμ1-HA and Tgμ1(D176A)-HA were localized using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:200). For cryoimmunoelectron microscopy localization, monolayers of Vero cells or human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with wild-type RH or stably transfected parasite clones for 24 h, fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde in 0.25 m HEPES (pH 7.4) for 48 h, scraped off in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted in 10% fish skin gelatin. The gelatin-embedded pellets were infiltrated overnight with 2.3 m sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were prepared with a Leica Ultracut microtome with cryoattachment and transferred to Formvar/carbon-coated specimen grids. Sections were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing affinity-purified rabbit anti-Tgμ1 antibody (1:20) or mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:100). Following phosphate-buffered saline washes, the sections were incubated with 1% fish skin gelatin containing 5-nm protein A-gold conjugate (1:70, from the laboratory of J. Slot) for 1 h. Sections were subsequently washed in phosphate-buffered saline, post-fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, and contrasted with 0.5% uranyl acetate in 2% methyl cellulose. Sections were observed, and images were recorded with a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope. Specificity of localization was determined by stereological analysis of 35–50 random sections of whole cells. The total number of gold particles and organelle surface areas were estimated from positive prints of transmission electron microscope negatives using a double-square test system (33Weibel E.R. Stereological Methods. Academic Press, New York1979Google Scholar). Monolayers of Vero cells or human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with RH or stably transfected parasite clones for 24 h, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 30 min, washed, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. Fixed samples were processed for Epon embedding and thin-sectioned for transmission electron microscopy using standard protocols. To assess the morphological differences in organelle biogenesis in wild-type RH-, Tgμ1-HA-, or Tgμ1(D176A)-HA-expressing parasites, 60 parasite sections from 20–30 random vacuoles were photographed at low magnification (×10,400) to examine gross cell morphology and at high magnification (×21,000) to analyze organelle structure. Total organelle number and surface areas were calculated from prints of transmission electron microscope negatives using a double-square overlay test system (33Weibel E.R. Stereological Methods. Academic Press, New York1979Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the pGBT9 and pACT2 vectors (Clontech) as previously described (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic tails at the C termini of putative transmembrane proteins GRA4 (dense granule protein-4; 52 amino acids), GRA7 (41 amino acids), ROP2 (75 amino acids), and ROP4 (85 amino acids), all containing YXXΦ motifs, were PCR-amplified and cloned in-frame behind the Gal4-binding domain in the pGBT9 vector. Tgμ1, Tgμ1(D176A), and Tgμ1(W415A) were cloned in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain in the pACT2 vector. Members of the Rop2 gene family contain dileucine residues upstream of an endocytic YXXΦ motif previously shown to be involved in targeting to mature rhoptries. Because dileucine residues can also mediate endocytic targeting by binding to adaptin β chains (see Refs. 34Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar and 35Greenberg M. DeTulleo L. Rapoport I. Skowronski J. Kirchhausen T. Curr.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these residues were mutated to di-alanine, and the ROP2 mutant was expressed in T. gondii. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (A), the L529A/L530A mutant localized to a compartment distinct from, but adjacent to, mature rhoptries, similar to the localization of ROP2 with a deletion of the YXXΦ motif (ROP2Δ) (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This compartment was distinct from the dense granules, micronemes, and Golgi/TGN of the parasite (Fig. 1 B), as was the ROP2Δ mutant (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Importantly, both the ROP2Δ mutant and the L529A/L530A mutant substantially co-localized with a multivesicular endosomal compartment marked by the endosomal marker VPS4 (vacuolarproteinsorting-4). 4M. Yang, I. Coppens, S. Wormsley, H. C. Hoppe, and K. A. Joiner, manuscript in preparation. Altogether, these data provide further evidence that rhoptry targeting occurs along the endocytic pathway and is mediated by adaptins. They also implicate adaptin machinery in mediating targeting from a post-Golgi compartment to a mature secretory organelle. We undertook experiments to further support and understand this observation. Based on a cDNA sequence (clone zz38e01) from the T. gondii data base of expressed sequence tags, a full-length medium chain (μ) of a clathrin adaptin was amplified from parasite cDNA. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones predicted an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 430 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 47.6 kDa. Alignment and dendrogram analysis of all four known classes of μ chains indicated that this T. gondiihomolog separates into the μ1 cluster and shares the highest similarities (75–79%) and identities (58–62%) with the adaptin μ1 chain (Fig. 2) (data not shown). The sequence also contains the signature residues (173VFLD176, Lys203, Val399, Leu402, and414PWVR417) that are known to mediate binding to tyrosine and hydrophobic residues within the YXXΦ sorting motif (16Ohno H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We accordingly termed the T. gondii homolog Tgμ1. Southern blotting of parasite and host genomic DNAs (data not shown) indicated that the Tgμ1 gene is parasite-specific and single-copy, as also suggested by the recently available T. gondii genome sequence.2 Northern blotting of host and parasite total RNAs (data not shown) suggested that the Tgμ1 gene is translated as a precursor transcript and processed to a mature transcript, consistent with the presence of an intron. In mammalian cells, AP-1 is an essential regulator of membrane trafficking by mediating budding of clathrin-coated vesicles from the TGN, immature secretory granules, and endosomes. To define the specific roles of Tgμ1 in the multiple secretory and endocytic pathways in T. gondii, we first examined the localization of endogenous Tgμ1 using affinity-purified anti-Tgμ1 polyclonal antibody. As shown by immunofluorescence microscopy, endogenous Tgμ1 localized in RH parasites predominantly to a region anterior to the nucleus (Fig. 3), consistent with the Golgi/TGN of the parasite, although additional punctate and cytosolic staining was observed. Brefeldin A, which disrupts the T. gondii Golgi cisternae, but not the Golgi scaffold (25Pelletier L. Stern C.A. Pypaert M. Sheff D. Ngô H.M. Roper N. He C.Y. Hu K. Toomre D. Coppens I. Roos D.S. Joiner K.A. Warren G. Nature. 2002; 418: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 37Hager K.M. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2631-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only partially dispersed the Golgi/TGN staining of Tgμ1, suggesting that the protein is partially localized to a brefeldin A-resistant compartment(s) in addition to the Golgi. We then stably expressed wild-type Tgμ1 tagged with the HA epitope (Tgμ1-HA). Putative Golgi/TGN localization and partial redistribution by brefeldin A (Fig. 3) were observed for the transgenic Tgμ1-HA reporter. This result suggests that the transgenic epitope-tagged Tgμ1 is incorporated into an AP-1 complex, which is appropriately localized in the parasite. Tgμ1-HA partially co-localized with the transgenic Golgi/TGN marker bacterial alkaline phosphatase-low density lipoprotein receptor (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as well as with endogenous T. gondii proteins (dynamin and ADP-ribosylation factor-1) (38Liendo A. Stedman T.S. Ngô H.M. Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18272-18281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with a predominant Golgi localization (Fig. 3 B). Partial co-localization with the rhoptry compartment was also detected (Fig. 3 B), although this was more accurately discerned by immunoelectron microscopy (see below). We analyzed the localization of Tgμ1 by qualitative (Fig. 4, A–C) and quantitative (Fig. 4 D) immunolabeling of cryosections. Consistent with the immunofluorescence localization, endogenous Tgμ1 localized to the Golgi/TGN, to juxtaposed coated Golgi-associated vesicles and tubules and endosomes, and to both the rhoptry membrane and membranous lumen. No significant labeling was observed for dense granules, mitochondria, or the nucleus, although microneme labeling was also detected. Altogether, the results suggest that Tgμ1 is localized to multiple compartments in the secretory and endocytic pathways, including mature secretory organelles. We next sought to disrupt Tgμ1 function to assess effects on transport through the secretory pathway and on organelle biogenesis. We have previously shown that Tgμ1 binds to the ROP2 cytoplasmic tail in a fashion dependent upon the YEQL motif in the ROP2 cytoplasmic tail (13Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We therefore introduced mutations in Tgμ1 at residues previously shown in mammalian adaptins to bind to the YXXΦ motif, specifically D176A and W415A (18Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 30Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and stably expressed these mutants inT. gondii. The Tgμ1(D176A)-HA mutant localized to the Golgi/TGN region and to punctate brefeldin A-resistant clusters (Fig. 3), suggesting that the protein was incorporated into an adaptin complex. In contrast, the W415A mutant was diffusely distributed in the cytosol (data not shown), suggesting that the protein failed to associate with other chains of the AP-1 complex. Quantification of immunostained cryosections indicated that Tgμ1(D176A)-HA was still associated predominantly with the Golgi/TGN, Golgi-associated vesicles and tubules, rhoptries, and micronemes (Fig. 4 D). Overall, the relative association of Tgμ1(D176A)-HA with organelles was nearly identical to that of endogenous Tgμ1, further supporting a broad organellar distribution for AP-1 in T. gondii irrespective of interaction with cargo. We sought to confirm that introduction of the D176A and W415A mutations altered binding of Tgμ1 to tyrosine-based motifs. Binding of Tgμ1 to the cytoplasmic tails containing putative YXXΦ motifs of dense granule (GRA4, YAEL; and GRA7, YRHF) and rhoptry (ROP2, YEQL; and ROP4, YREM) proteins was tested by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Tgμ1 bound to the cytoplasmic tail of ROP4 to a greater extent than to that of ROP2. In contrast, Tgμ1 did not bind to YXXΦ motifs within the putative cytoplasmic tails of the dense granule proteins GRA4 and GRA7 (Fig. 5 A). The avidity of Tgμ1 binding to the ROP2 tail was increased when a triplicated YEQL motif was added to the truncat"

In the eukaryotic plasma membranes, sphingolipids and phosphatidylcholine are mainly located in the outer leaflet, whereas amino phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS)1 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) reside in the inner membrane. A number of protein toxins utilize plasma membrane lipids as their receptors;e.g. cholera toxin binds ganglioside GM1 (1Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Holmes R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 177-190Google Scholar), shiga toxin recognizes glycolipid Gb3 (2Lingwood C.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Google Scholar). These receptor lipids are located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Cinnamycin (Ro 09–0198) is a 19-amino acid tetracyclic peptide produced by Streptomyces species (4Kessler H. Mierke D.F. Saulitis J. Seip S. Steuernagel S. Wein T. Will M. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 427-433Google Scholar). Cinnamycin is a member of the lantibiotics group of toxins. Lantibiotics are bacteriocins that are characterized by the presence of a high proportion of unusual amino acids (5McAuliffe O. Ross R.P. Hill C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 285-308Google Scholar). Whereas many lantibiotics are directed against other Gram-positive species, the action of cinnamycin is not limited to bacterial cells. Lysis of red blood cells has also been observed upon treatment with this toxin (6Choung S.Y. Kobayashi T. Inoue J. Takemoto K. Ishitsuka H. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 940: 171-179Google Scholar). Cinnamycin is unique in that the toxin specifically binds PE that is located in the inner layer of the plasma membrane in mammalian cells (7Choung S.Y. Kobayashi T. Takemoto K. Ishitsuka H. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 940: 180-187Google Scholar, 8Machaidze G. Ziegler A. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1965-1971Google Scholar, 9Hosoda K. Ohya M. Kohno T. Maeda T. Endo S. Wakamatsu K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 226-230Google Scholar). The mechanism of the recognition of inner leaflet lipid by cinnamycin is not well understood. In the present study, we showed that cinnamycin induced transbilayer lipid movement in target cells so that PE was exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Cinnamycin-induced lipid flip-flop was reconstituted in model membranes. Model membrane study revealed that the presence of PE is required to initiate lipid flip-flop by cinnamycin. Fourier transform infrared-polarized attenuated total reflection (FTIR-PATR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the order parameter of the hydrocarbon chain of PE was significantly reduced in the presence of cinnamycin. FTIR-PATR also showed that the re-orientation of PE was accompanied by the β-sheet formation of cinnamycin. When the surface concentration of PE was high, cinnamycin induced membrane re-organization such as membrane fusion and the alteration of gross morphology of the membrane.

Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Annexin V and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated streptavidin were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Calcein was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Cinnamycin (Ro 09-0198) was kindly provided by H. Ishituka (Nippon Roche Research Center, Japan). Biotinylated cinnamycin was prepared according to Aoki et al. (10Aoki Y. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 291-297Google Scholar) with modification. 0.5 ml of 500 μm cinnamycin in 0.1 mNaHCO3 was mixed with 0.5 ml of EZ-LinkTMsulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hezanoate (NHS-LC-biotin, Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) (8.7 mg/ml sterilized water). After 2-h incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 m lysine solution. Biotinylated cinnamycin was purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a column of Cosmosil 5C18-AR-300 (Nacalai Tesque). The peptide was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing concentration of acetonitrile from 20 to 60% in water in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. The binding of biotinylated cinnamycin to various lipids was measured by ELISA as described previously (3Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol.

In brief, 50 μl of lipid (10 μm) in ethanol was added to a well of microtiter plate (Immulon 1, Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA). After the solvent was evaporated at room temperature, 200 μl of 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) was added to each well. After washing, the wells were incubated with 50 μl of 100 nm biotinylated cinnamycin in TBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA (1% BSA-TBS) for 2 h at room temperature. The bound cinnamycin was detected by incubating with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The intensity of the color developed with o-phenylenediamine as a substrate was measured with an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad, model 550 microplate reader), reading the absorption at 490 nm with reference at 630 nm. Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with the incubation buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). Cells were then incubated with 1 μm cinnamycin or biotinylated cinnamycin in the incubation buffer containing Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Annexin V. At appropriate intervals, cells were fixed and labeled with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated streptavidin at room temperature. The stained cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat 63XW Korr (1.2 numerical aperture) objective. Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were prepared by hydrating a lipid film with 20 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) and vortex mixing. Liposomes were dispersed by a few seconds of sonication in the bath type sonicator. To prepare large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), MLVs were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles followed by extrusion through polycarbonate filters with 0.1-μm pore size (Nuclepore, Maidstone, UK) for 25 times using a two-syringe extruder (12MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Google Scholar). The transbilayer movement of short chain fluorescent lipids C6-NBD-PE and C6-NBD-PC was measured by mixing labeled LUVs with BSA (13Valcarcel C.A. Dalla Serra M. Potrich C. Bernhart I. Tejuca M. Martinez D. Pazos F. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2761-2774Google Scholar). C6-NBD lipids were incorporated into DOPC or POPC vesicles containing various amount of DOPE or POPE. Vesicles were mixed with 400 μg/ml BSA before addition of 2.5 μm cinnamycin at 30 °C. Selective extraction of the labeled lipid by BSA was detected via the decrease in fluorescence due to quenching by BSA (14Marx U. Lassmann G. Holzhutter H.G. Wustner D. Muller P. Hohlig A. Kubelt J. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2628-2640Google Scholar). The time course of NBD fluorescence was monitored with a fluorometer (JASCO, FP-6500) (λex = 475 nm, λem = 530 nm). CD spectra of 100 μm cinnamycin in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were measured on a Jasco J-720 apparatus using 0.5-mm path-length quarts cell. Results from five scans were averaged. Transmission Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were measured on a Bio-Rad FTS-3000MX spectrometer, using a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (Hg-Cd-Te) detector and Win-IR software. 1 mm cinnamycin in D2O containing 40 mm Hepes-NaCl (50 μl) was applied between the two CaF2 windows. A total of 256 scans was collected. Difference spectra were obtained by digitally subtracting solvent spectra. Dry-cast films of POPE/cinnamycin were prepared by uniformly spreading an HFIP solution of POPE (5 μmol)/cinnamycin (0.4 μmol) on the surface of a germanium ATR plate (80 × 10 × 4 mm) followed by the gradual evaporation of the solvent. The last trace of solvent was removed by overnight incubation under vacuum. The film thickness estimated from the applied amount of the lipid was 5–6 μm. The lipid film was hydrated with a piece of D2O-wet filter paper put over the plate for 3 h. FTIR-PATR measurements were carried out on a Bio-Rad FTS-3000MX spectrometer equipped with a Hg-Cd-Te detector and a PIKE horizontal ATR attachment (PIKE Technologies Inc., Madison, WI) and an AgBr polarizer (15Yano Y. Takemoto T. Kobayashi S. Yasui H. Sakurai H. Ohashi W. Niwa M. Futaki S. Sugiura Y. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3073-3080Google Scholar). The total reflection number was 10 on the film side. The spectra were measured at a resolution of 2 cm−1 and an angle of incidence of 45° and derived from 256 co-added interferograms with the Happ-Genzel apodization function. The dichroic ratio, R, defined by ΔA ∥/ΔA ⊥, was calculated from the polarized spectra. The absorbance (ΔA) was obtained either as a peak height of the CH2 symmetric stretching vibration band or as an area of the amino bands. The subscripts ∥ and ⊥ refer to polarized light with its electric vector parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, respectively. For ATR correction, refractive indexes of 4.003 and 1.440 were used for germanium and the sample film, respectively. Liposome fusion was monitored by measuring the reduction of resonance energy transfer between NBD- and LRh-labeled lipids in lipid vesicles (16Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Google Scholar, 17Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Google Scholar). Donor MLVs (100 μm total phospholipids) containing 1 mol %N-NBD-PE and N-LRh-PE were mixed with 1 mm acceptor MLVs that do not contain fluorescent lipids. 1 μm cinnamycin was added to the mixture, and the time course of liposome fusion was measured by monitoring the increase of NBD fluorescence at 475 nm at 30 °C. For negative staining, multilamellar vesicles containing a total of 50 nmol of lipids were incubated with 2 μg of cinnamycin for 30 min at 37 °C. The mixture were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at 37 °C and washed with PBS by centrifugation. The suspension was adsorbed on poly-l-lysine-treated, Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate. The specimens were observed in a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7500, Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. For immunogold labeling, 50 nmol of liposomes was incubated with 2 μg of biotinylated cinnamycin. Liposomes were then fixed as above, washed in PBS, and blocked with 2% BSA/PBS for 60 min at 4 °C. The fixed specimens were adsorbed on poly-l-lysine/Formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids. The grids were incubated with 5 nm of gold-conjugated anti-biotin IgG for 60 min at room temperature, washed with distilled water, and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. The fixed grids were negatively stained with uranyl acetate as above. For freeze-fracture electron microscopy, multilamellar liposomes treated with cinnamycin as described above were frozen in a high-pressure freezer (HPM 010, BAL-TEC Inc., Balzers, Liechtenstein). Immediately after freezing, the frozen samples were placed into liquid nitrogen for storage. The samples were then fractured in a freeze-etching machine (BAF 400T, BAL-TEC Inc., Balzers) at −110 °C, replicated by platinum/carbon, collected on Formvar-coated grids, and examined with an electron microscope (Tecnai 10, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The cytotoxicity of cinnamycin was monitored by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as described previously (18Kobayashi T. Pimplikar S.W. Parton R.G. Bhakdi S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 227-231Google Scholar). Liposome lysis assay was performed as described previously (3Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Google Scholar) using calcein as a fluorescent marker. Cinnamycin is cytotoxic to both mammalian cells (19Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12400-12405Google Scholar) and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Kato U. Emoto K. Fredriksson C. Nakamura H. Ohta A. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Kobayashi T. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37855-37862Google Scholar). The fact that cinnamycin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells have a defect in PE synthesis (19Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12400-12405Google Scholar, 21Emoto K. Umeda M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1215-1224Google Scholar) suggests that the binding of cinnamycin to PE is essential to induce cell lysis. The specific binding of cinnamycin to PE has been studied relative to the ability of cinnamycin to bind other phospholipids (7Choung S.Y. Kobayashi T. Takemoto K. Ishitsuka H. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 940: 180-187Google Scholar, 8Machaidze G. Ziegler A. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1965-1971Google Scholar) or proteins (22Emoto K. Kobayashi T. Yamaji A. Aizawa H. Yahara I. Inoue K. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12867-12872Google Scholar). However, the binding of cinnamycin to other plasma membrane lipid components such as glycolipids has not been examined. Therefore, we first measured the binding of cinnamycin to various phospholipids and glycolipids (Fig. 1). Cinnamycin has high affinity for PE as described previously. Phosphatidylserine (PS) gave a slightly positive signal, whereas other phospholipids and glycolipids tested did not bind cinnamycin. The binding of cinnamycin to PE was not dependent on incubation temperature as described previously (10Aoki Y. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 291-297Google Scholar). Incubations of cinnamycin and PE at 4 °C and 37 °C gave similar degrees of specific binding. Unlike lipid binding, the cytotoxicity of cinnamycin to HeLa cells showed a clear temperature dependence (Fig. 2). The toxicity, monitored by the release of LDH activity, increased in a time-dependent manner at 37 °C, whereas at 4 °C LDH was not released. Both naturally occurring and biotinylated cinnamycin showed a similar extent of cytotoxicity as reported earlier (10Aoki Y. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 291-297Google Scholar). Cells treated with cinnamycin at 4 °C, washed and then incubated at 37 °C, did not release LDH. This result indicates that cinnamycin must be present during high temperature incubation. Because cinnamycin binds PE at 4 °C, our result suggests that the amount of PE on the cell surface at steady state was not enough for cinnamycin to induce cytotoxicity. Previously it was shown that the number of cinnamycin bound to the cells increased in a time-dependent manner at 37 °C (10Aoki Y. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 291-297Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, we visualized the binding of biotinylated cinnamycin to HeLa cells at 37 °C. Within 1 min of treatment, cinnamycin gave small positive signal on the cell surface (Fig. 3 A). The biotin-cinnamycin-positive area increased during incubation. During incubation, Annexin V also became bound to the cell surface. Many of the Annexin V-positive regions were also stained with cinnamycin. Annexin V is known to recognize negatively charged phospholipids such as PS in a calcium-dependent manner (23Reutelingsperger C.P. Kop J.M. Hornstra G. Hemker H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 171-178Google Scholar, 24Reutelingsperger C.P. Hornstra G. Hemker H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 625-629Google Scholar, 25Andree H.A. Stuart M.C. Hermens W.T. Reutelingsperger C.P. Hemker H.C. Frederik P.M. Willems G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17907-17912Google Scholar, 26Tait J.F. Gibson D. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7944-7949Google Scholar). These results indicate that cinnamycin induces exposure of both PE and PS in HeLa cells at 37 °C. At 4 °C, the binding of cinnamycin to the cells was not detected under fluorescence microscope (Fig. 3 B), indicating the presence of very few PE molecules on the surface of steady-state cells. Like cinnamycin, Annexin V did not bind cells at 4 °C. In the absence of cinnamycin, Annexin V did not bind cells even at 37 °C (Fig. 3 B). Although binding of cinnamycin occurs after 1 min of treatment, prolonged incubation was required to induce cell lysis. This result indicates that the transbilayer lipid movement precedes cell lysis.Figure 3Exposure of PE and PS to the cell surface during treatment of HeLa cells with biotinylated cinnamycin. A, cells were treated with 1 μmbiotinylated cinnamycin in the presence of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Annexin V at 37 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” At appropriate intervals, cells were fixed and labeled with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated streptavidin. The distribution of Alexa Fluor 546 fluorescence (cinnamycin) and Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence (Annexin V) were monitored using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope as described under “Materials and Methods.” B: left, HeLa cells were treated with 1 μm cinnamycin in the presence of Annexin V for 30 min at 4 °C; right, cells were incubated in the absence of cinnamycin but in the presence of Annexin V for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed and labeled with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated streptavidin. Merged fluorescence of Alexa 488 and 546 is shown. Very little fluorescence was observed under these conditions. Bar: 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then asked whether cinnamycin itself has the ability to induce transbilayer lipid movement in model membranes. In Fig. 4, we measured the transmembrane movement of fluorescent lipids, C6-NBD-PC and C6-NBD-PE, by the method of extraction of short chain lipids by BSA (13Valcarcel C.A. Dalla Serra M. Potrich C. Bernhart I. Tejuca M. Martinez D. Pazos F. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2761-2774Google Scholar, 14Marx U. Lassmann G. Holzhutter H.G. Wustner D. Muller P. Hohlig A. Kubelt J. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2628-2640Google Scholar). Addition of BSA decreased the fluorescence to 60–70% of initial intensity. This is very likely because of the extraction of the outer leaflet C6-NBD-lipids by BSA (13Valcarcel C.A. Dalla Serra M. Potrich C. Bernhart I. Tejuca M. Martinez D. Pazos F. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2761-2774Google Scholar, 14Marx U. Lassmann G. Holzhutter H.G. Wustner D. Muller P. Hohlig A. Kubelt J. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2628-2640Google Scholar). The effect of BSA was not changed significantly by the incorporation of POPE into the liposomes. If PE is included in the membrane, the subsequent addition of cinnamycin further decreased the fluorescence. The decrease of fluorescence depends upon the amount of PE in the membrane. Inclusion of as little as 1% PE in the liposomes was effective. Under these conditions liposome lysis monitored by the release of calcein was less than 2%. These results indicate that cinnamycin promotes the transbilayer movement of the fluorescent phospholipids in model membranes. However, without PE cinnamycin did not induce flip-flop of fluorescent phospholipids. Because cinnamycin induced transbilayer movement of both fluorescent PC and PE, it is suggested that there is no lipid selectivity in the outward translocation of phospholipids. Peptide-induced perturbation of bilayer structures was estimated by examining the CH2 symmetric stretching band near 2850 cm−1 using Fourier transform infrared-polarized attenuated total reflection (FTIR-PATR) (27Casal H.L. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 381-401Google Scholar, 28Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Google Scholar). The dichroic ratio, R, of an absorption band obtained by PATR spectra is a measure of the orientation of its transition moment or molecular axis. For membranes much thicker (∼6 μm) than the penetration depth (under our experimental conditions, 0.2–0.8 μm in the range of 3000–800 cm−1), an R value smaller than 2 indicates that the moment lies essentially parallel to the membrane surface (28Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Google Scholar, 29Okamura E. Umemura J. Takenaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 68-75Google Scholar, 30Matsuzaki K. Shioyama T. Okamura E. Umemura J. Takenaka T. Takaishi Y. Fujita T. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 419-428Google Scholar). From the dichroic ratio R, the frequency and order parameter, S, is calculated by use of Equation 1 (28Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Google Scholar, 29Okamura E. Umemura J. Takenaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 68-75Google Scholar, 30Matsuzaki K. Shioyama T. Okamura E. Umemura J. Takenaka T. Takaishi Y. Fujita T. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 419-428Google Scholar). This parameter is connected to the following, S=−2(R−2)/(R+1.45)Equation 1 where the mean orientation angle, α, is between the hydrocarbon chain and the membrane normal through Equation 2, assuming the uniaxial orientation of the chain around the normal,S=(1/2)(3cos2α−1)Equation 2 The results of the calculations are summarized in TableI. The presence of cinnamycin in D2O-hydrated POPE films significantly reduced the order parameter, indicating that the orientation axis of the lipid was perturbed by the peptide.Table IConformations and orientations of lipid hydrocarbon chainsSample1-aSamples were hydrated with D2O.Wavenumber1-bCH2 symmetric stretching band.R1-cDichroic ratio.S1-dOrder parameter of the acyl chain.α1-eMean orientational angle between the hydrocarbon chain and the membrane normal.cm −1degreesPOPE28521.31 ± 0.010.51 ± 0.0135.1 ± 0.2POPE/cinnamycin28531.70 ± 0.070.22 ± 0.0246.3 ± 1.0Results are the mean of duplicate experiments ± difference.1-a Samples were hydrated with D2O.1-b CH2 symmetric stretching band.1-c Dichroic ratio.1-d Order parameter of the acyl chain.1-e Mean orientational angle between the hydrocarbon chain and the membrane normal. Open table in a new tab Results are the mean of duplicate experiments ± difference. We then asked whether the conformation of cinnamycin was altered in the presence of PE. The CD spectrum of cinnamycin gave a minimum at 197 nm, characteristic of a random coil conformation (Fig. 5 A) (28Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Google Scholar). The conformation of cinnamycin in solution was also examined using transmission IR (Fig. 5 B). The major band at 1641 cm−1 originated from a random coil structure and was in good agreement with the CD spectrum. Fig. 5 C shows ATR spectra of D2O-hydrated DOPE/cinnamycin (12.5/1) films in the region of 1600–1700 cm−1. The band at 1633 cm−1 was assigned to β-sheet conformation whereas the band at 1660 cm−1 corresponds to the formation of turn structure. The dichroic ratio of the amide I region was close to 2, suggesting a random orientation of the peptide or an orientational angle close to the magic angle (54.7°) with respect to the membrane normal. When the surface concentration of PE was high, cinnamycin induced dynamic membrane re-organization. In Fig. 6, we measured the activity of cinnamycin to induce liposome fusion. The increase of NBD fluorescence indicates that fusion occurs between donor and acceptor membranes. Cinnamycin-induced membrane fusion in DOPC/DOPE (1:1) and to a lesser degree in POPC/POPE (1:1) liposomes. However PC liposomes did not fuse in the presence of cinnamycin. Fusion requires a high concentration of PE in the membrane, because the addition of 10% POPE to POPC did not cause cinnamycin-induced membrane fusion (data not shown). The ultrastructure of liposomes in the presence of cinnamycin was examined by negative staining and freeze-fracture electron microscopy (Fig. 7). Cinnamycin did not alter the morphology of DOPC membranes (Fig. 7, A and C). Addition of 50% DOPE dramatically altered the ultrastructure of the membranes after the treatment with cinnamycin (Fig. 7, B andD). Characteristic restiform aggregates were accumulated on liposomes. Immunogold labeling showed that cinnamycin was present in these aggregates (Fig. 7 B). Freeze-fracture images visualized that these structures consisted of moniliform aggregates (Fig. 7 D). Our results indicate that cinnamycin induces transbilayer lipid movement in target cells. Flip-flop of plasma membrane phospholipids caused the exposure of PE, which is a specific receptor for cinnamycin. The binding of increased number of cinnamycin to the cell surface induced a dramatic membrane reorganization that eventually leads to cell death. We cannot exclude the possibility that the observed binding of cinnamycin was a result of spontaneous flip-flop of cell PE during incubation. However, unlike inward translocation (t 12 = minutes), reported outward translocation of phospholipids is rather slow (t 12 ≅ 1.5 h) (31Bitbol M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6783-6787Google Scholar, 32Connor J. Pak C.H. Zwaal R.F. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19412-19417Google Scholar, 33Dekkers D.W. Comfurius P. Schroit A.J. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.

In addition, the exposure of PS in treated cells indicates that cinnamycin has the ability to induce transbilayer phospholipid movement. Although cinnamycin weakly bound PS in ELISA, previously it was shown that the binding of cinnamycin to the cells was abolished in the presence of PE-containing liposomes, indicating that cinnamycin specifically recognized PE in the cell membrane (35Emoto K. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Karasuyama H. Inoue K. Umeda M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 430-434Google Scholar). Model membrane experiments indicate that PE is necessary for cinnamycin to induce transbilayer lipid movement. Using amino-reactive probe, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, it has been shown that in steady-state fibroblasts, 2–2.5% of total PE is exposed to the cell surface (36Sleight R.G. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9050-9058Google Scholar,37Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5966-5973Google Scholar). We could not detect positive signals with biotinylated cinnamycin at 4 °C incubation under fluorescence microscope. The binding of cinnamycin to PE monitored by ELISA was not temperature-dependent. These results suggest that the steady-state amount of PE on the cell surface was too low to be detected by biotinylated cinnamycin under fluorescence microscope. However, cinnamycin bound this small amount of PE and did induce transbilayer phospholipid movement. Because preincubation of cells with cinnamycin at 4 °C did not affect the plasma membrane permeability to LDH even after incubation at 37 °C, the binding of cinnamycin to the steady-state amount of cell surface PE was not sufficient to induce membrane damage. Time course experiments indicate that transbilayer phospholipid movement precedes a membrane permeability change. Like cinnamycin, the type I lantibiotic nisin, which is a cationic peptide, induces transbilayer lipid movement without causing membrane leakage (38Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6565-6570Google Scholar). Recently Zhang et al. (39Zhang L. Rozek A. Hancock R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35714-35722Google Scholar) showed that natural and synthetic cationic antimicrobial peptides induce lipid flip-flop at peptide concentrations that were 3- to 5-fold lower than those causing leakage of membrane. Induction of transbilayer lipid movement has also been reported with the antimicrobial peptide magainin 2 (40Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11361-11368Google Scholar) as well as synthetic peptides (41Fattal E. Nir S. Parente R.A. Szoka F.C., Jr. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6721-6731Google Scholar). Unlike nisin and flip-flop-inducing synthetic peptides, cinnamycin is electrically neutral. Cinnamycin is unique in that flip-flop occurs in PE concentration-dependent manner, and the binding of the toxin to cells is dependent on the transbilayer lipid movement. That is, the toxin self-promotes its own binding to target cells by causing the exposure of the binding PE molecules that reside in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The mechanism of the induction of lipid flip-flop by cinnamycin is not clear. Proton NMR analysis has revealed that one cinnamycin molecule binds one PE (42Wakamatsu K. Choung S.Y. Kobayashi T. Inoue K. Higashijima T. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 113-118Google Scholar). Our FTIR study indicates that, in the presence of PE, cinnamycin undergoes conformational change, resulting in the increase of β-sheet structure. Enrichment of β-sheet structure in the presence of phospholipid has also been shown for nisin (43el-Jastimi R. Lafleur M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 151-158Google Scholar). The observation that the orientation of cinnamycin was random and that the order parameter of acyl chains of PE was significantly reduced suggests that the toxin may locally induce a non-bilayer structure, inducing flip-flop of phospholipids in the cell membrane. This idea is consistent with the fact that, when the membrane concentration of PE is high, cinnamycin could induce dramatic membrane alteration. Recently, using 31P and 2H NMR, Machaidze et al. (8Machaidze G. Ziegler A. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1965-1971Google Scholar) demonstrated a perturbation of the bilayer structure of POPC/POPE (4:1) vesicles in the presence of cinnamycin. Membrane fusion is often accompanied by non-bilayer structure. Our electron microscopy image suggests the formation of non-bilayer structure in cinnamycin-treated PC/PE liposomes. Our results together with the NMR observation by Machaidze et al. suggest that the dynamic reorganization of the membrane is associated with cinnamycin-induced cell death. We thank T.

https://openalex.org/W2002715260,"The propagation of mechanically induced intercellular calcium waves (ICW) among osteoblastic cells occurs both by activation of P2Y (purinergic) receptors by extracellular nucleotides, resulting in “fast” ICW, and by gap junctional communication in cells that express connexin43 (Cx43), resulting in “slow” ICW. Human osteoblastic cells transmit intercellular calcium signals by both of these mechanisms. In the current studies we have examined the mechanism of slow gap junction-dependent ICW in osteoblastic cells. In ROS rat osteoblastic cells, gap junction-dependent ICW were inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium, plasma membrane depolarization by high extracellular potassium, and the L-type voltage-operated calcium channel inhibitor, nifedipine. In contrast, all these treatments enhanced the spread of P2 receptor-mediated ICW in UMR rat osteoblastic cells. Using UMR cells transfected to express Cx43 (UMR/Cx43) we confirmed that nifedipine sensitivity of ICW required Cx43 expression. In human osteoblastic cells, gap junction-dependent ICW also required activation of L-type calcium channels and influx of extracellular calcium.

In ROS rat osteoblastic cells, gap junction-dependent ICW were inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium, plasma membrane depolarization by high extracellular potassium, and the L-type voltage-operated calcium channel inhibitor, nifedipine. In contrast, all these treatments enhanced the spread of P2 receptor-mediated ICW in UMR rat osteoblastic cells. Using UMR cells transfected to express Cx43 (UMR/Cx43) we confirmed that nifedipine sensitivity of ICW required Cx43 expression. In human osteoblastic cells, gap junction-dependent ICW also required activation of L-type calcium channels and influx of extracellular calcium. connexin43 intercellular calcium waves α-glycyrrhetinic acid voltage-operated calcium channels Connexin43 (Cx43)1-mediated gap junctional communication regulates bone matrix production in vitro (1Lecanda F.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Modulation of gap junctional communication in vitro alters osteocalcin production by transcriptional regulation.In vivo, detailed analysis of Cx43-deficient mice has revealed distinctive skeletal abnormalities. However, the mechanisms by which Cx43-mediated gap junctional communication alter bone formation are poorly understood. One such mechanism may be by the coordination of intercellular calcium signaling among osteoblastic cells. A well described in vitro model, and one which may mimic the effects of mechanical forces on bone cells, is that of mechanically induced intercellular calcium signaling or intercellular calcium waves (ICW). Two mechanisms for the propagation of mechanically induced ICW in osteoblastic cells have been described. In the UMR 106–01 rat osteoblastic cell line, mechanical stimulation of a single osteoblast leads to propagation of fast (∼15 μm/s) ICW that require activation of P2Y (purinergic) receptors on neighboring cells, presumably by released nucleotides, and subsequent generation of inositol trisphosphate and release of intracellular calcium stores. In the ROS 17/2.5 rat osteoblastic cell line, slow ICW require gap junctional communication. Unlike gap junction-mediated ICW that have been identified in many other cell models, gap junction-mediated ICW in ROS cells do not require release of intracellular calcium stores and do not require diffusion of IP3 through gap junction pores. In human osteoblastic cells, both of these mechanisms for the propagation of ICW have been identified and have different kinetics. Mechanical stimulation of human osteoblast-like cells results in fast calcium waves that require activation of P2Y receptors. If these waves are blocked by desensitization of P2Y receptors, slow gap junction-dependent ICW are unmasked. In this study we have investigated the mechanism of slow gap junction-dependent ICW in osteoblastic cells and found that these ICW involve plasma membrane depolarization, activation of L-type voltage-operated calcium channels, and influx of extracellular calcium. The rat osteoblastic cell lines, ROS 17/2.8 (ROS) and UMR 106–01 (UMR) and UMR cells transfected with the gene coding for the gap junction protein, connexin43 (UMR/Cx43) (3Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Geist S.T. Robertson A.J. Veenstra R.D. Wang H.-Z. Warlow P.M. Hick E. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), were grown in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Geneticin (200 μg/ml) was added to the medium of UMR/Cx43 cells. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C with medium change every 2–3 days. Human osteoblastic cells were isolated from human bone marrow obtained from healthy volunteers, age 20–36, by puncture of the posterior iliac spine. All participants had read and signed informed consent, and the study was approved by the local ethics committee. The marrow material was collected in phosphate-buffered saline with Ca and Mg (Invitrogen) containing 100 units/ml Heparin (Sigma). The mononuclear fraction of the marrow was isolated on a Lymphoprep (Nycomed) gradient and plated. The next day the supernatant was aspirated to remove the non-adherent cells. Adherent cells were then grown in Minimal Essential Medium without phenol red (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C, with medium change every 7 days. After 4–5 weeks of culture when cells reached ∼80% confluence, the medium was supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) for 7–10 days to enhance osteoblastic differentiation. For calcium imaging experiments, cells were plated on 25-mm No. 1 glass coverslips for 2–4 days and used at 70–90% confluence. The fluorescent calcium indicator, fura-2, was used for calcium imaging and measurements and purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Nucleotides were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, was purchased fromCalbiochem and used in a final concentration of 50 nm. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The gap junction inhibitor, heptanol, was made fresh on the day of experiment as a 1:4 heptanol:ethanol solution and used in a final concentration of 3.5 mm. α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), also a gap junction inhibitor, was used in a final concentration of 2 or 5 μm. Nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCC) was used in a concentration of 1, 5, or 10 μm. Measurement of intracellular calcium concentration was performed using the fluorescent calcium indicator, fura-2. Cells in monolayers adherent to non-coated glass coverslips were incubated at 37 °C in Minimum Essential Medium containing 5 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min and then incubated in fresh medium without dye for an additional 20 min. Coverslips were affixed to a teflon chamber and mounted in a PDMI-2 open perfusion microincubator (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY), maintained at 37 °C with superfused CO2, on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. Imaging was performed with a Metamorph/Metafluor imaging system (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA), with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm for acquiring ratio images of fura-2. Probenecid (Sigma) at a concentration of 1 mm was added throughout the experiments to prevent dye leakage. Intercellular calcium waves were initiated by mechanical stimulation of a single cell using a borosilicate glass micropipette affixed to an Eppendorf 5171 micromanipulator. Intercellular calcium waves were initiated by mechanically stimulating single cells in monolayers. As previously shown, stimulation of a single ROS cell caused a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration in the stimulated cell. Subsequently, an intercellular calcium wave was transmitted to neighboring cells with a time lag of 15–30 s (Fig. 1). This intercellular calcium wave propagated to 2.4 cells and with slow kinetics (wave propagation of 2–4 μm/s) as previously defined (1Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Ziambaras K. Cheng S.L. Koval M. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In UMR/Cx43 cells, mechanical stimulation of a single cell initiated intercellular calcium waves as well, but these waves were faster (15 μm/s) and propagated to an average of 23 cells with only a short time lag between neighboring cells (Fig. 1). These kinetics are similar to those previously defined in the parental UMR cells and have previously been shown to require activation of P2Y receptors but not gap junctional communication. In human osteoblastic cells, the mechanically induced intercellular calcium waves propagated with a velocity of 10–12 μm/s and extended to 7.6 cells with an intermediate time lag between cells. The gap junction inhibitor AGA was used to confirm that inhibition of gap junctional communication blocked the spread of intercellular calcium signals in ROS cells. Monolayers of ROS cells were loaded with fura-2, and ICW were induced before and after the addition of 2 or 5 μm AGA. Mechanically induced ICW extended to 2.8 cells before addition of AGA and to 0.3 cells after AGA was added (Fig. 2). No difference was seen between 2 or 5 μm AGA. After washing the AGA away with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, mechanically induced ICW were partially restored, propagating to 1.4 cells. AGA did not inhibit mechanically induced ICW in UMR cells; waves propagated to 17 cells before adding AGA and to 24 cells after adding AGA (2 μm) to the medium. The gap junction inhibitor heptanol was also used to confirm the involvement of gap junctions in the propagation of ICW in osteoblastic cells. The initial untreated wave in the ROS cells extended to an average of 2.8 cells. Freshly mixed heptanol was added to the bathing solution in a final concentration of 3.5 mm. After 5 min, ICW were almost totally blocked, with a calcium signal propagated only to 0.3 cells. As with AGA, wave propagation could be partially restored by removing heptanol (1.3 cells/wave). Thus, the propagation of intercellular calcium waves in ROS cells, but not in UMR cells, requires intact gap junctional communication, in agreement with previous data (4Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that intracellular calcium stores are not required for the propagation of ICW in ROS cells (4Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To confirm that gap junction-dependent ICW required influx of extracellular calcium, ICW were assessed after the bathing medium was exchanged for calcium-free medium (Fig. 2). ICW propagation was assessed within 2 min of medium exchange; at this time the cells retained ionomycin-releasable intracellular calcium stores (not shown). In contrast, P2-dependent ICW in UMR cells extended farther in calcium-free medium than in calcium-containing medium (48 cells/waveversus 30 cells/wave). The above results implied that a plasma membrane calcium channel was involved in gap junction-dependent ICW in ROS cells. To assess the involvement of L-type calcium channels in the wave mechanism, monolayers of ROS cells were treated with nifedipine, an antagonist of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Nifedipine was used in a final concentration of 1, 5, or 10 μm. At all concentrations, nifedipine inhibited ICW propagation (Fig. 2). Replacing the bathing solution with nifedipine-free medium restored the ability of the cells to propagate ICW. In contrast, UMR waves were not inhibited by nifedipine treatment, and in fact propagated farther: 28 cells/wave before addition of nifedipine and 50 cells/wave in the presence of nifedipine. Because L-type calcium channels are activated by membrane depolarization, prior membrane depolarization would inhibit ICW by preventing membrane depolarization at the time of ICW generation. For these experiments, ROS cells were depolarized using medium containing 70 mmKCl. Before depolarization, ICW propagated to 2.6 cells/wave. After the cells were switched to the high potassium medium, there was a calcium response in all cells because of depolarization-induced activation of VOCC. After the cells had returned to resting [Ca2+]i, another mechanical stimulus was applied, and the wave now propagated only to 0.6 cells. Changing back to the original medium with physiological potassium concentration restored ICW propagation (1.8 cells/wave). In UMR cells, this protocol again had the reverse effect on ICW propagation; the number of cells in the wave increased from 21 to 33, similar to the result seen after nifedipine treatment or removal of extracellular calcium. Because ICW in ROS cells require gap junctional communication, the above data suggest that the L-type calcium channel activation responsible for ICW is dependent on gap junctional communication in ROS cells. We tested this hypothesis by examining ICW in UMR/Cx43 cells, which express both their native P2Y2 receptors and transfected Cx43 gap junction protein (4Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that the fast calcium wave in these cells, like UMR ICW, did not require extracellular calcium as follows. Single cells in fura-2-loaded monolayers of UMR/Cx43 cells were stimulated mechanically. A fast wave was seen, similar to the wave in untransfected UMR cells. The wave spread to an average of 24 cells. Next, the medium was exchanged for calcium-free medium, and ICW were assessed within 2 min. In calcium-free medium the wave spread to an average of 34 cells/stimulated cell. Next, we confirmed that the slow ICW unmasked by desensitization of ATP receptors in UMR/Cx43 required gap junctional communication. The fast P2 receptor-dependent ICW were blocked by desensitizing the receptors with 100 μm ATP, which inhibits further response to ATP without depleting intracellular calcium stores (4Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Mechanical stimulation of single UMR/Cx43 cells now revealed a slow ROS-like wave that extended to 3.0 cells. This slow ICW was absent in untransfected UMR cells similarly treated. Finally, AGA (2 μm) was added to the bathing solution of UMR/Cx43 cells, and upon mechanical stimulation ICW were almost completely blocked (0.5 cells in wave). Again, the AGA effect was reversed by washing the cells in solution not containing AGA (2.3 cells in wave). Finally we asked whether these slow ICW, which were present in UMR/Cx43 but not in UMR, required L-type calcium channels and plasma membrane depolarization. When ICW were elicited in UMR/Cx43 cells in medium containing 1 μm nifedipine before desensitization of P2 receptors, ICW propagated to 30 cells compared with 25 cells without nifedipine. In high potassium experiments performed as described above, adding potassium increased the wave from 31 cells before to 36 cells after. In contrast, when these experiments were performed in UMR/Cx43 after desensitization of P2 receptors, both nifedipine- and potassium-induced membrane depolarization blocked the slow gap junction-dependent ICW. Human osteoblastic cells propagate both fast P2 receptor-dependent ICW and slow gap junction-dependent ICW (5Jorgensen N.R. Henriksen Z. Brot C. Eriksen E.F. Sorensen O.H. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As was seen in UMR/Cx43 cells, 5 μm AGA did not block fast ICW propagation in the human cells; fast ICW propagated to 7.6 cells before addition of AGA and 6.9 cells after addition of AGA. Addition of ATP to human osteoblastic cells resulted in a widespread calcium response and desensitization so that subsequent addition of ATP did not cause calcium transients. After ATP desensitization, mechanical stimulation elicited a slow ICW that propagated to an average of 4.7 cells. The slow ICW were inhibited by 5 μm AGA, confirming that the slow ICW unmasked after desensitization of P2 receptors require gap junctional communication. We then asked whether gap junction-dependent ICW seen in ATP-desensitized human osteoblastic cells were inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium, plasma membrane depolarization by high external potassium, or VOCC inhibitors as summarized in Table I. Removal of extracellular calcium resulted in inhibition of the slow wave (Fig. 2). Slow ICW were also blocked by the L-type calcium channel inhibitors nifedipine (Fig. 2), verapamil, or nitrendipine or membrane depolarization in high extracellular potassium (Fig. 3). To confirm these treatments did not inhibit the P2Y-dependent wave, experiments were performed in cells that were not exposed to ATP. No inhibition of fast ICW was seen after adding nifedipine in a final concentration of 1 μm to the bathing solution, with an average extent of the wave to 4.9 cells in the wave before nifedipine and 5.1 cells in the wave after nifedipine (Fig. 2).Table IMaximal extent of calcium transients expressed as number of cells in waveAddedROSHOBHOB (after ATP desensitization)Vehicle2.757.64.5(n = 455, S.E. = 0.12)(n = 108, S.E. = 0.26)(n = 90, S.E. = 0.2)ATP2.5(n = 46, S.E. = 0.31)α-Glycyrrhetinic acid0.36.91.7(n = 38, S.E. = 0.13)(n = 22, S.E. = 0.38)(n = 15, S.E. = 0.26)Low extracellular [Ca2]0.00.4(n = 22, S.E. = 0.0)ND1-aExperiments performed earlier in another study (9), where no inhibition of the wave was seen compared to vehicle-treated cells.(n = 17, S.E. = 0.25)Nifedipine0.85.11.6(n= 27, S.E. = 0.25)(n = 9, S.E. = 0.67)(n= 16, S.E. = 0.33)VerapamilNDND0.8(n = 12, S.E. = 0.26)NitrendipineNDND0.6(n = 10, S.E. = 0.22)Maximal number of cells in a wave after adding different agents.

In low extracellular calcium, some cells form gap junction hemichannels at the plasma membrane that may mediate release of ATP and propagation of ICW that appear to be gap junction-dependent (6Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S., Li, J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). We asked whether osteoblastic cells express functional gap junction hemichannels by monitoring uptake of the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow added to the extracellular medium. In ROS cells and UMR/Cx43 cells no uptake of dye was seen in medium containing either normal calcium or no extracellular calcium (data not shown). In human osteoblastic cells, no Lucifer Yellow uptake was seen in medium containing extracellular calcium. However, in calcium-free medium, Lucifer Yellow uptake was seen in ∼10% of cells. These studies show that slow gap junction-mediated intercellular calcium waves in osteoblastic cells require the influx of extracellular calcium through L-type VOCC, as summarized in Table I. The propagation of gap junction-dependent ICW was abolished in the absence of extracellular calcium. Depolarization of the plasma membrane with high potassium inhibited the waves, presumably by preventing the activation of L-type calcium channels by rapid changes in the plasma membrane potential. Finally, L-type calcium channel antagonists blocked wave propagation. Nifedipine in concentrations as low as 1 μm inhibited ICW; electrophysiological studies have shown that nifedipine concentrations of 10 μm selectively blocked the L-type VOCC with no effects on T-type VOCC in osteoblastic cells (7Morain P. Peglion J.L. Giesen-Crouse E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 220: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear what is diffusing through gap junctions to mediate these ICW, the requirement for plasma membrane depolarization and activation of VOCC suggests that ionic traffic through gap junctions may be responsible (Fig. 4). This mechanism would be reminiscent of the transmission of calcium transients in excitable tissues such as cardiac myocytes. However, the ICW in osteoblastic cells are much slower than in excitable tissues, suggesting some fundamental difference in mechanism or in receptor density. This model for the propagation of gap-junction-dependent ICW differs from the model for ICW propagation originally proposed for respiratory epithelia and invoked for other cell types, including hepatocytes and glial cells. In this previously described model, ICW are propagated by diffusion of inositol trisphosphate through gap junction channels and subsequent release of intracellular calcium stores (8Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Science. 1992; 258: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 9Sanderson M.J. Dirksen E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7302-7736XCrossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although ROS cells are well coupled by gap junctions comprised of Cx43, they do not propagate mechanically stimulated ICW via IP3 diffusion, demonstrated by the observation that depletion of intracellular calcium stores has no effect on mechanically induced ICW propagation in these cells (4Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It is unclear why these cells do not propagate ICW by diffusion of IP3 through gap junctions. One possible explanation is that osteoblastic cells may not express sufficient levels of Cx43 to permit the amount of IP3 diffusion that is required for these ICW to occur. Another possibility is that different connexins may be required to allow ICW mediated by IP3 diffusion. In primary osteoblastic cells, ICW that require IP3-mediated release of intracellular calcium stores can occur. However, these ICW do not require gap junctional communication; they involve activation of P2 receptors by extracellular ATP. This mechanism for ICW propagation occurs in many cells because G protein-coupled P2Y receptors are widely expressed. These P2-mediated ICW may complicate analysis of ICW propagation and must be excluded before ICW can be attributed to gap junctional communication. We have previously shown that monolayers of hamster tracheal epithelia (4Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and mouse nasal epithelia (10Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) propagate IP3-dependent ICW that do not require gap junctional communication but do require activation of P2 receptors. In glioma cells, connexins participate in P2 receptor-mediated ICW by forming plasma membrane hemichannels that release ATP (6Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S., Li, J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). We could not detect gap junction hemichannel formation in the rat osteoblastic cell lines, and in human osteoblastic cells we demonstrated hemichannel formation in only 10% of cells and only under low calcium conditions. It is therefore unlikely that hemichannels play a role in the gap junction-mediated ICW seen here. If gap junction hemichannels did participate in osteoblast ICW, they would have to do so by mediating calcium influx rather than by mediating ATP release. These studies demonstrate that gap junction-mediated ICW in ROS cells are a good model for the gap junction-dependent coordination of ICW that occurs in human osteoblastic cells. Intercellular calcium signaling in human osteoblastic cells is complex because it involves both gap junction-dependent and P2Y-receptor-dependent mechanisms, but the two mechanisms can be studied independently, as demonstrated in this study and our previous work on ICW in human osteoblastic cells and can be modeled independently using the ROS and UMR rat osteoblastic cell lines. In contrast to gap junction-dependent ICW, P2Y-dependent ICW in UMR cells and primary osteoblastic cells were actually increased after removal of extracellular calcium, VOCC inhibition, or addition of potassium to depolarize the cells. These fast P2Y-mediated waves therefore seem to be inhibited by calcium influx via VOCC activation for reasons that are not readily apparent. Gap Junction-mediated intercellular communication is important for production of bone matrix proteins in vitro (1Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Ziambaras K. Cheng S.L. Koval M. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and for normal bone development in vivo (2Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The current studies suggest that activation of L-type calcium channels might be an important component of the signaling pathway by which gap junctional communication influences bone development or turnover. The current work highlights the importance of L-type VOCC in osteoblast calcium signaling and suggests the possibility that regulation of the expression and activity of VOCC may be important in modulating the coordination of calcium signaling that occurs among osteoblasts. Osteoblasts have been demonstrated to express plasma membrane VOCC that can mediate calcium entry (11Karpinski E., Wu, L. Civitelli R. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Pang P.K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Yamaguchi D.T. Green J. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 197-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VOCC have been implicated in regulation of protein expression in bone cells. Applying strain to osteoblasts in vitro in the presence of Bay K 8644, an agonist of L-type VOCC, has been shown to increase the expression of certain proteins specific for bone formation, such as osteopontin and osteocalcin (13Walker L.M. Publicover S.J. Preston M.R. Said Ahmed M.A. el Haj A.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 648-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In vitro fluid shear stress applied to the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 increased TGF-β mRNA expression (14Sakai K. Mohtai M. Iwamoto Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 63: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a growth factor involved in bone formation. Verapamil, an antagonist of L-type VOCC, inhibited this increase. Another L-type VOCC antagonist, nifedipine, prevented loading-related increases in prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in rat osteoblasts, but not in osteocytes (15Rawlinson S.C. Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. Bone. 1996; 19: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is possible that the ICW characterized here are involved in these processes. In conclusion, we have shown that the gap junction-dependent propagation of intercellular calcium signals in ROS rat osteoblastic cells requires influx of extracellular calcium through L-type VOCC and that the gap junction-dependent component of intercellular calcium signaling in human osteoblastic cells occurs by the same mechanism. These findings suggest that regulation of the expression or activity of L-type calcium channels may be a means by which calcium signaling is modulated in bone cells and that modulation of these channels may influence bone turnover."

Nuclear receptor coactivators contain one or more conserved LXXLL (where L is leucine and X any amino acid) signature motif, which has been found to be necessary and sufficient for ligand-dependent interactions with the activation function-2 domain present in the C-terminal hormone-binding region of the nuclear receptors (1McKenna N.J.

Deletion of CBP/p300 and PBP genes in the mouse results in embryonic lethality around E11.5 days, indicating that disruption of these pivotal anchoring coactivators affects the integrity of the cofactor complexes, thus altering the function of many nuclear receptors and most likely of other transcription factors (20Yao T.-P., Oh, S.P.

Of interest is that the recently identified coactivator designated PRIP/ASC2/RAP250/NRC/TRBP has also been shown to interact with several nuclear receptors and with CBP/p300 and TRAP130 of the TRAP/DRIP/ARC complex (10Zhu Y.

Thus, PRIP appears to serve as a bridge between the first complex anchored by CBP/p300 and the downstream TRAP/DRIP/ARC mediator complex anchored by PBP. Furthermore, the recently isolated PRIP-interacting protein with RNA methyltransferase activity, designated PIMT (25Zhu Y., Qi, C. Cao W.-Q. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10380-10385Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), forms a complex with CBP, p300, and PBP (26Misra P., Qi, C., Yu, S. Shah S.H. Cao W.-Q. Rao M.S. Thimmapaya B. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20011-20019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), further attesting to the possibility that two major multiprotein cofactor complexes anchored by CBP/p300 and PBP, respectively, merge into one megacomplex on DNA template (28Selfridge J. Pow A.M. McWhir J. Maghin T.M. Melton D.W. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since PRIP and PRIP-binding protein PIMT appear to link the two cofactor complexes under in vitro conditions, we have found it necessary to explore the biological function of PRIP by generating mice with PRIP null phenotype. We now demonstrate that PRIP is critical for the embryonic development, since disruption of the PRIP gene in the mouse leads to embryonic lethality around E11.5 to E12.5 days, implying that PRIP (like CBP/p300 and PBP) is also critical for embryonic development and survival. The genomic DNA fragment containing the full-length PRIP gene was isolated from a mouse 129/Sv P1 bacteriophage library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO), using polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-CAATGCAGCCTGTTCCTGT-3′ and 5′-GCTGCTGCATCACCATGAAA-3′ designed from mouse PRIP cDNA sequence (10Zhu Y. Kan L., Qi, C. Kanwar Y.S. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13510-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A Cre-LoxP system was employed to delete exon 7 from the PRIP gene. For this purpose, we constructed a triple-LoxP PRIP targeting vector to generate a “floxed” mouse PRIP-targeted locus. The targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into HM1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (28Selfridge J. Pow A.M. McWhir J. Maghin T.M. Melton D.W. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transfected ES cells were selected in the medium with G418 (200 μg/ml), and the surviving colonies were screened for homologous recombination by PCR with primers P1 5′-CCTACAGCTGCAAGCAAATC-3′ and P2 5′-TATACGAAGTTATGCGGCCG-3′. ES cells with the appropriate PRIP floxed targeted locus were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B), and the euploid selected ES cells were used for injection into 3.5-day-old blastocysts derived from C57/B6 mouse by the Northwestern University Targeted Mutagenesis Facility to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric male mice were bred with wild type C57/B6 female to produce heterozygous mice, which were then crossed with EIIa-Cre transgenic mice (29Lee Y.-H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to delete the DNA fragment between LoxP1 and LoxP3. EIIa-cre-mediated recombination occurs early in development (2–8 cells), and mice carrying the allele with deletion were crossed with wild type C57/B6 to achieve germ line transmission. The heterozygous mice with expected deletion were interbred to generate homozygous mutants. DNA extracted from the tail tips of mice and from the yolk sac of embryos was used for genotyping by PCR. The mice carrying the recombination between LoxP1 and LoxP3 on one allele were identified by PCR with primers P1/P2 and P3 (5′-CGGCCGCATAACTTCGTATA-3′)/P4 (5′-TTCTTCTTCCGAGGCGGTTT-3′). Presence of P1/P2 product, while lacking P3/P4 amplification, indicated the deletion of PRIP gene on one allele. The homozygosity for the deletion was detected by the absence of exon 7 as ascertained by PCR with primers P5 5′-ACGGGCCACCAAATATGATG-3′ and primer P4 (see above) (Fig. 1 C). For RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from embryos with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Primers 5′-CCTACAGCTGCAAGCAAATC-3′ and 5′-CGAACATGCTGCATGAGCTGA-3′ were used to amplify the region between exon 6 and exon 8 from the PRIP homozygous mutant. To detect PRIP protein in embryos, whole cell lysates were prepared from the embryos by homogenization and probed with anti-mouse PRIP antiserum. The signal was detected by ECL detection system. Age-matched embryos were fixed in paraformaldehyde or 10% of buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned at 5-μmthickness in sagittal or transverse planes, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining for the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed using a standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex protocol as described previously (24Crawford S.E., Qi, C. Misra P. Stellmach V. Rao M.S. Engel J.D. Zhu Y. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3585-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Giemsa stain was done using the standard protocol. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated from E11.5 embryos and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% of fetal bovine serum as described (22Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For transfection, 2 × 105 of MEFs were plated in six-well plates for overnight culture. The transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE-2000 Plus reagent according to manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). Plasmids pCMV-PPARγ, PPRE-TK-LUC, pCMV-RXR, RXRE-TK-LUC, pCMV-RAR, and RARE-TK-LUC were as described previously (10Zhu Y. Kan L., Qi, C. Kanwar Y.S. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20011-20019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ was used as a cotransfectant, which served as control for transfection efficiency. Cell extracts were prepared 36 h after transfection and were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. We constructed a conditional knock-out allele of PRIP by using the Cre/loxP recombination system according to the strategy in Fig. 1 A. To generate conventional PRIP knock-out mice (in which the gene is permanently inactivated at the germ cell stage), it was necessary to induce recombination between loxP sites. To achieve heterozygosity, PRIP-targeted mice were bred with homozygous Cre transgenic mouse line, EII-cre (29Lee Y.-H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EII-cre mice carry the Cre transgene under the control of the adenovirus EIIa promoter and express Cre recombinase only in early mouse embryos (2–8 cell stage), and it induces the recombination between the two loxP sites with the same orientation (29Lee Y.-H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We detected the expected, all types of recombinants among the offspring (29Lee Y.-H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombination between loxP1 and loxP3 resulted in the deletion of PRIP exon 7 and a reading frameshift to generate a stop codon right after the fusion between exon 6 and exon 8. The chimeras were crossed to wild type mice to produce heterozygous mice carrying one recombinant PRIP allele, and the homozygous mice were obtained from heterozygous mating. By sequencing the RT-PCR products, exon 7 was not found in mRNA transcribed from the recombinant PRIP allele, and the reading frameshift was introduced by the deletion leading to a premature stop codon (data not shown). As the result, only 488 amino acids at the N terminus containing no LXXLL motif can possibly be translated from the mRNA, but no PRIP protein was detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Among 26 new-born pups, and 54 mice that were 3 weeks old generated from intercrosses between heterozygous PRIP mutant mice, no homozygous mutants were detected. Genotyping the embryos at different stages of gestation showed that no PRIP null embryos survived beyond E13.5 (13.5 days postcoitum). However, heart beating was observed among the majority of viable PRIP null embryos recovered between E11.5 and E12.5 and few were moribund or dead. These observations indicate lethality occurred in a relatively narrow window of time as no viable PRIP null embryos were seen at E13.5. The viable PRIP−/−embryos recovered at E11.5 and E12.5 exhibited clear evidence of growth retardation compared with the wild type and heterozygous littermates. PRIP−/− embryos appeared strikingly different at the gross level at E12.5, they were pale and smaller in size than their PRIP+/+ and PRIP+/− littermates (Fig. 2, A and B). Normally, extraembryonic mesoderm of the yolk sac gives rise to blood and endothelial cells, which form blood islands. The extraembryonic membrane covering PRIP null embryos contained fewer vessels in contrast to wild type yolk sac with its well developed blood vessels (Fig. 2 B). In addition, superficial vasculature was less obvious in PRIP null mutants (Fig. 2 D). While the liver of wild type embryos was easily visualized by its rich vasculature through the skin, only a pale primitive liver bud was discerned in PRIP−/−embryos (Fig. 2 D). Failure of palatal shelf to fuse, abnormal finder separations, and developmental abnormalities in brain were detected in PRIP−/− mutants (not illustrated). In wild type placenta at E12.5 contains three distinct trophoblast cell structures: the innermost labyrinthine layer, the intermediate spongiotrophoblast layer, and the outermost trophoblast giant cell layer. The labyrinthine zone formed by the fusion of chorion with allantois is composed of extensively branched fetal blood vessels and maternal blood sinuses among strands of diploid trophoblast cells that separate the maternal blood sinuses from fetal blood vessels. In PRIP null placenta, no compact layer of spongiotrophoblast cells was observed between labyrinth zone and trophoblast giant cell layer. Instead, islands of spongiotrophoblast-like cells dissociated from trophoblast giant cell layer and migrating into the labyrinth zone were common occurrence in PRIP−/− placenta (Fig. 3 B). In wild type placenta blood sinuses are filled with maternal blood cells throughout the labyrinthine layer (Fig. 3, A, C, andF), whereas most of the tortuous vessels in the PRIP−/− placenta were enlarged, ruptured, and generally empty (Fig. 3, B, D, andF). While the chorioallantoic fusion appeared to occur in PRIP mutant placenta, chorionic trophoblast cells clustered in labyrinth had multiple nuclei, and these clusters showed insufficient blood vessel branching. These changes are reminiscent of some of the placental defects observed in PBP null mutants (22Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Crawford S.E., Qi, C. Misra P. Stellmach V. Rao M.S. Engel J.D. Zhu Y. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3585-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, changes in PRIP−/− placenta appeared less profound when compared with PBP−/− placenta (24Crawford S.E., Qi, C. Misra P. Stellmach V. Rao M.S. Engel J.D. Zhu Y. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3585-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Nucleated fetal erythroblasts in PRIP−/− placenta had irregular shaped nuclei with very little cytoplasm (Fig. 3 F). Trophoblast cell proliferation in PRIP null placenta as assessed by PCNA immunostaining was significantly lower than that observed in PRIP+/+ placenta (data not shown). Inefficient pumping by the heart leading to circulation failure is one of the major causes of embryonic lethality during middle gestation. The development of heart requires coordinated differentiation of several embryonic lineages, including the myocytes of myocardium, the endothelial cells of the endocardium, and the cells of the neural crest that form the outflow tract. At E12.5, the heart of PRIP−/− embryos exhibited defects involving all three lineages (Fig. 4, A andB). In PRIP−/− heart, the epicardium, consisting of a single layer of mesothelial cells lining against the compact layer of myocardium, appeared to separate from underlying myocardium and this space is filled with blood cells (Fig. 4 B). Pericardial space surrounding the heart in mutant was much smaller than their wild type littermate. Unlike the ventricles in wild type heart, which consisted of multicell thick compact layer with well developed trabeculae, the ventricles in PRIP−/−heart only contained one or two cell layers of myocardium (Fig. 4). Cell-cell adhesion among cardiocytes appeared to be defective, which possibly contributes to leakage of blood cells into epicardial spaces. Cell proliferation in PRIP−/− myocardium was markedly reduced as compared with PRIP+/+ myocardium (Fig. 4,C and D). The failure of ventricular myocardium of PRIP−/− embryos to stratify into the multilayer compact structure required to sustain adequate cardiac function appears similar to that noted in PBP null and PPARγ null mutants (22Zhu Y., Qi, C.

Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Liver of PRIP null mutants appeared considerably smaller in size when compared with their littermates (Fig. 5, A and B). The function of the liver at E12.5 days is to become the major site of hematopoiesis so as to gradually replace yolk sac based hematopoiesis. Histological examination of PRIP−/− liver revealed reduction in hepatocyte population and an increase in hepatocyte apoptosis (Fig. 5 D). A marked decrease in the number of erythroid progenitors was also evident, and these cells had large nuclei with scant minimally hemoglobinized cytoplasm. Liver exhibited large numbers of megakaryocytes. To assess the impact of loss of PRIP on transcriptional activities of nuclear receptor, we isolated MEFs from PRIP−/− and PRIP+/+embryos. They were used for assaying the transcriptional activities of PPARγ, RXR, and RAR. In wild type MEFs transfected with a RXR expressing vector and RXR-responsive element-linked reporter, the addition of RXR-ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid induced marked increase (∼76-fold) in the transcription (Fig. 6 A). In PRIP−/−MEFs, the induction of ligand-mediated RXR transcription was markedly reduced (∼3-fold). Transcription assays with PPARγ (Fig. 6 B) and RARα (data not shown) showed that the influence of PRIP was only modest. These results demonstrated that nuclear receptors require PRIP to achieve their full transcriptional potential, although the contribution of PRIP to the activities of the three nuclear receptors examined here differed somewhat in that PRIP seemed to influence RXR maximally. The nuclear hormone receptors comprise a superfamily of transcription factors that regulates coordinated expression of gene networks involved in developmental, physiological, and metabolic processes (1McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Notable among this nuclear receptor superfamily is PPAR subfamily comprising of three isoforms, PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARβ/δ, since these receptors have emerged in recent years as a critical player in regulating energy metabolism. In an effort to understand the factors controlling cell and gene specific transcriptional events initiated by nuclear receptors, the ligand-binding domain of nuclear receptors was used in the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify receptor interacting proteins (2Onate S.A.

During the past 7 years, more than 25 nuclear receptor coactivators have been cloned raising the issue of redundancy, since these coactivators generally appear promiscuous in their coactivation potential. To fully appreciate the in vivo biological functions of these coactivators, molecular genetic approaches are being increasingly employed. Previous studies have demonstrated that mice lacking SRC-1 or p/CIP/SRC-3 are viable and manifest either partial or full redundancy for certain nuclear receptor actions (32Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J.

In contrast, deletion of more general coactivators such as CBP/p300 and PBP in mice leads to embryonic lethality implying that these are essential coactivators (20Yao T.-P., Oh, S.P. Fuchs M.

Our observations reported here now add coactivator PRIP to the class of essential coactivators because of the embryonic growth retardation, defects in placental, cardiac and hepatic development, and embryonic lethality. Embryonic lethality was noted between E11.5 and E12.5 days with no viable embryos at E13.5. Defects were noted in heart (reduced amount of myocardium and noncompaction), liver (small liver with reduction in hepatocyte population, and hepatocyte apoptosis), and defects in erythropoiesis (reduced hemoglobinization) and placenta (maturation block of trophoblast with vascularization defect). The placental defects, although not as pronounced as those encountered in PBP−/−placenta (22Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

It should be noted that we isolated both PRIP and PBP using PPARγ as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen and identified them as nuclear receptor coactivators (9Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jain S. Rao M.S.

Recent studies have established that PBP is indispensable for embryonic development because PBP null mutation leads to embryonic death around E11.5 of mouse development (22Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jia Y.

PBP null mutation also causes defects in the development of placental vasculature similar to those encountered in PPARγ mutants, supporting the requirement of PBP for PPARγ function in vivo (22Zhu Y., Qi, C.

PBP null mutants also exhibited cardiac failure because of noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium and resultant ventricular dilatation (22Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J.

There was also paucity of retinal pigment, excessive systemic angiogenesis, a deficiency in the number of megakaryocytes, and an arrest in erythrocyte differentiation (24Crawford S.E., Qi, C.

We showed that PBP interacts with GATA family of transcription factors and thus influences the development of vital organ systems (24Crawford S.E., Qi, C. Misra P. Stellmach V. Rao M.S. Engel J.D. Zhu Y. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3585-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view is that the gene encoding PBP is amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (39Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jain S. LeBeau M.M. Espinosa III, R. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10848-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Like PBP, PRIP is also highly amplified/overexpressed in human breast and colon tumors (11Lee S.-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.-E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.-Y. Jung Y.-K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.-H. Cheong J.H. Lee Y.C. Meltzer P.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34283-34293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), suggesting that both PBP and PRIP by virtue of their coactivating function may augment cell proliferation and neoplastic progression. Finally, the PRIP null MEFs exhibited marked repression of RXR-mediated transcriptional activity as compared with PPAR and RAR. These observations strongly suggest that PRIP has better preference for RXR than other nuclear receptors, and some of the abnormalities noted in PRIP null mutants may be due to inhibition of RXR function. Further studies are needed to examine the role of PRIP in various tissues by generating PRIP conditional null mice. Deletion of the AIB3 (ASC-2) gene has been described recently (40Kuang S.-Q.

Volumetric determination of integrase-DNA complexes imaged by atomic force microscopy during the initial turnover additionally revealed substrate-induced assembly of a tetramer.

In the “processing” reaction, the reverse transcriptase-generated DNA copy of the viral genome is trimmed by the endonucleolytic removal of the 3′-dinucleotides from its ends. The two processed 3′-ends are then inserted into opposing strands of the host DNA in the “joining” reaction via a concerted cleavage-ligation reaction (3Brown P.O. Bowerman B. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M.

In vitro, integrase also catalyzes the apparent reversal of the joining reaction, the “disintegration” activity, on Y-shaped oligodeoxynucleotide substrates (11Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 1. These Y-shaped substrates resemble products of integrase-catalyzed joining and contain a nick immediately 5′ of the joining site. The disintegration reaction effectively reverses joining by resealing the nick while concurrently displacing the inserted viral sequence. This reaction is routinely used to assay integrase in vitro (8Chow S.A. Methods. 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,12Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J.

However, the two active sites of the subunits in these structures are outwardly oriented on opposite sides of the crystallographic dimers, too far apart (>50 Å) to be spanned by the requisite 5–6 bp stagger separating the two sites of concerted integration on the host DNA (20Yang Z.N.

We have previously elucidated some mechanistic aspects of substrate specificity for the processing reaction of the avian sarcoma virus (ASV)1 integrase by presteady-state kinetics (9Bao K.K.

Here, we report the use of a presteady-state disintegration assay that mitigated these aggregation problems, allowing us to determine the reaction stoichiometry by active site titrations. Volumetric analysis of integrase particles imaged by atomic force microscopy during the first turnover additionally establishes the quaternary structure of the functional unit. Our results will be discussed in the context of the hypothesized tetramer models. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by the Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology Central Services Laboratory (Oregon State University). Purification by denaturing PAGE, spectrophotometric determination of concentrations, and 5′-radiolabeling were as described previously (9Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol.

Standard reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmNa-HEPES, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.050 mg ml−1 acetylated bovine serum albumin, 250 or 400 mm NaCl, and with or without 5 mmMnCl2. Preincubations were carried out in the absence of MnCl2 for 30 min and the reaction subsequently initiated by the addition of 37 °C MnCl2 to 5 mm. A complete range of preincubation times and temperatures were tested to ensure that equilibrium had been achieved. Gel analysis, image quantitation, and non-linear least squares fittings were performed according to Bao et al. (9Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol.

Imaging was performed with a Nanoscope IIIa instrument (Digital Instrument, Santa Barbara, CA) using the tapping mode in air. Nanosensor Pointprobe non-contact/tapping mode sensors with a nominal spring constant of 48 newton/m and resonance frequencies of 190 kHz were used for all images. The protein and DNA molecules were deposited onto freshly cleaved mica (Spruce Pine Mica Co., Spruce Pine, NC), immediately washed with deionized distilled water, and dried with a stream of N2 (gas). Depositions of disintegration reactions during the first catalytic turnover were obtained by preincubating 4 μm integrase with 5 μm substrate DNA in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 250 mm NaCl for a minimum of 30 min on ice, diluting the reaction to 64 nm integrase and 150 mm NaCl immediately prior to initiating the reaction by the addition of MnCl2 to 5 mm. Aliquots were then deposited within 10 s of initiating the reaction. All images were collected with a scan rate of 3.2 Hz, at 512 × 512 resolution, and a scan size of 1 μm2. Volume analysis of AFM data was performed with the freeware program ImageSXM (based on NIH Image developed at the National Institutes of Health) using image plane fitting, image analysis, volume calculations, and conversion to molecular weights according to MWapp = (volume x nm−3 + 25) ÷ 1.31 kDa−1 as described (24Ratcliff G.C.

For single-turnover experiments, the substrate was 5′-radiolabeled on the 19-nt target fragment, denoted by the asterisk in Fig. 1, which is converted to a 44-nt product during disintegration (inset, Fig. 2). Substrate (0.25 μm) was preincubated with excess ASV integrase (1 μm monomers) for 30 min in the absence of Mn2+ to allow equilibrium formation of productive complexes (9Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 10Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol.

Fig. 2(closed circles) shows biphasic conversion of the radiolabeled 19-nt substrate to the expected 44-nt product. Non-linear least squares fit of the data to a double-exponential function yielded observed rate constants of 0.05 and 0.002 s−1 with respective amplitudes of 17 and 60%. When the reaction was initiated by mixing integrase and substrate without preincubation but in the presence of Mn2+, we observed a single 0.002 s−1 exponential phase (Fig. 2, open circles) with an amplitude (75 ± 0.9%) that was, within error, equal to the sum of the amplitudes (77 ± 1.4%) observed with preincubation. The fast phase reflected 17% productive integrase-substrate complexes formed during the preincubation period in the absence of Mn2+ that was rapidly converted to product at 0.05 s−1 upon addition of the metal cofactor. In contrast, the 0.002 s−1 phase observed in both experiments reflected slower assembly of productive complexes in the presence of Mn2+. The significant amplitude of the slower exponential phase in the preincubated experiment, therefore, indicated that 60% more productive complexes were formed following the addition of the metal cofactor, suggesting that the formation of these complexes is facilitated by the presence of the metal cofactor (26Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When experiments were performed at lower concentrations of integrase with preincubation, the amplitudes of the two exponential phases became reduced and an additional linear phase became apparent (Fig. 3 A, inset). The apparent “burst” kinetics behavior is characteristic of enzymatic mechanisms where products are formed at the active site faster than they dissociate, resulting in rapid turnover of the first equivalent of substrates bound while subsequent steady-state turnovers are rate-limited by slow product release to regenerate the free enzyme. As in the single-turnover experiments, the first turnover burst consisted of two exponential phases reflecting the rapid 0.05 s−1conversion of productive complexes preformed in the absence of Mn2+ followed by a slower rate of assembling additional complexes in the presence of the Mn2+. To determine the number of integrase protomers required to catalyze the disintegration of a single substrate, we performed active site titrations by measuring the sum of the two exponential amplitudes at fixed DNA concentrations as a function of increasing integrase to substrate DNA ratio. Fig. 3 A shows two such titrations carried out at 250 mm NaCl with 0.25 μm DNA and at 400 mm NaCl with 0.5 μm DNA. In both cases, the total first turnover amplitude increased linearly with added integrase up to a ratio of four integrase protomers per substrate DNA. At integrase:substrate ratios above 4:1, a plateau was reached with no further apparent change in the burst amplitude, indicating that the substrate binding capacity of the added integrase exceeded the concentration of substrate. These results defined a reaction stoichiometry of four protomers per substrate molecule. Additionally, the same reaction stoichiometry was obtained at different DNA and NaCl concentrations, and titrations performed using integrase purified by different protocols also yielded identical results (data not shown). The maximum burst amplitude observed at both salt concentrations represented less than complete binding of substrate DNA added albeit to different extents. If the missing 15–25% reflected a subpopulation of substrate that could not be bound by integrase, then the measured reaction stoichiometry of four should be divided by this plateau value to obtain the true reaction stoichiometry. On the other hand, if the missing fraction represented a subpopulation of integrase-substrate complex that was silent in the disintegration assay, i.e.did not generate the monitored product, then an adjustment may not be necessary. When we monitored the release of the viral-end fragment from the Y-shaped substrate rather than the regeneration of the 44-nt target fragment under identical conditions, we observed an additional exponential phase in which the missing 15–25% of the substrate was slowly cleaved (2 × 10−5 s−1) to completion at the viral-target joining junction (data shown in Fig. 3 B for 250 mm NaCl). This reaction was integrase-catalyzed yet could not have arisen from 3′-hydroxyl attack by the target 19-nt fragment as the corresponding target 44-mer product was not generated concurrently. We therefore concluded that the missing 15–25% amplitude represented a competing but silent subpopulation of the integrase-substrate complex that underwent hydrolytic attack at the joining junction instead of disintegration. Thus, the amplitude observed in the active site titrations represented a fraction of integrase-substrate complex that underwent disintegration as opposed to hydrolysis, leading us to conclude that the measured reaction stoichiometry of four was accurately determined without further adjustments. The reaction stoichiometry of four defined by the active site titrations, while necessary, is not sufficient to establish a tetrameric functional oligomeric state. To verify an active tetrameric structure, we determined the molecular weight of integrase complexes in the presence and absence of DNA by AFM volumetric analysis using the linear relationship between measured AFM volumes and molecular weights previously established for proteins ranging from 41 to 670 kDa (24Ratcliff G.C. Erie D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5632-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,25Xue Y. Ratcliff G.C. Wang H. Davis-Searles P.R. Gray M.D. Erie D.A. Redinbo M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2901-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To ensure the functional relevance of the particles imaged, depositions were made during the first turnover within 10 s of initiating the reaction. A typical 1-μm2 AFM image of integrase alone showed primarily particles with volumes consistent with monomers and dimers (Fig. 4 A, top). By comparison, increased numbers of tetramer-sized particles were observed in images deposited in the presence of the Y-shaped substrate (Fig. 4 A, bottom). Analysis of the integrated volumes for all particles imaged confirmed that in the absence of DNA, integrase appeared predominantly as monomers and dimers (Fig. 4 B, top). In contrast, a new peak with a mean molecular volume of 154 ± 7.5 nm3, corresponding to a calculated molecular weight of 138 kDa, became apparent and accounted for ∼20% of the particles in the presence of DNA (Fig. 4 B, bottom). When these population distributions were adjusted to more accurately reflect the number of integrase protomers subsumed within each volumetric subpopulation by taking into account the mass of each particle (Fig. 4 C), we observed that the presence of substrate DNA induced nearly half of the integrase protomers analyzed to assemble into tetramers. Aggregates larger than tetramers, though visible, did not accumulate in sufficient numbers to segregate into discrete populations of a defined size, e.g.an octamer, and were therefore excluded from the statistical analysis. Additionally, the small number of these larger aggregates is inconsistent with the magnitude of productive complexes observed in the presteady-state burst. The 138-kDa apparent mass observed was larger than expected for a tetramer of four 32-kDa subunits presumably due to the additional presence of the bound DNA. However, the apparent difference of 10 kDa underestimated the actual mass of the DNA. It is plausible that part of the volume contributed by the DNA may be topologically obscured within the concavity of the DNA binding site. Alternatively, the linear calibration curve determined for globular proteins is unlikely to yield accurate volume to mass conversion for DNA whose partial specific volume in aqueous solution can be considerably smaller than for proteins. The structure of the full-length 32-kDa integrase protein is unknown. However, the central catalytic core domain (15Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R.

Based on these structures, several dimer-of-dimers models have been proposed (20Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Bushman F.D. Hyde C.C. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this model, a pair of inward-facing functional active sites is contributed by the two inner, or “proximal,” protomers at the dimer-dimer interface. The two remaining outward-facing active sites of the two “distal” protomers are not used for catalysis (20Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Bushman F.D. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Coordinated processing of both ends of the viral DNA would therefore require concurrent binding of the two viral ends in active sites on both sides of the dimer-dimer interface (Fig. 5 A). Our results suggest that concerted integration may further require binding of the target DNA bridging the dimer-dimer interface (Fig. 5 B). Although we cannot be certain of the molecular details of DNA binding in the absence of cocrystal structure, the observation that the Y-substrate, with only a single viral-end mimic, was able to induced active tetramer assembly would suggest significant contribution by the target DNA in mediating the dimer-dimer interaction. The calculated electrostatic potential at the surface of the proposed tetramer (Fig. 5 B) shows that a ∼30-Å wide, positively charged groove extends along this interface, suggesting that the assembly of the tetramer would require the juxtaposition of two positively charged surfaces. The neutralization of this like-charge repulsion by the binding of the negatively charged target DNA into this groove would greatly enhance the stability of the tetramer and may form the molecular basis for the observed DNA-induced assembly.

Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), concerns persist that the disintegration reaction may not be mechanistically relevant. The skepticism arises in part from the observation that the catalytic core domain can catalyze the disintegration reaction but not the forward joining reaction, leading to the notion that the disintegration reaction might represent a less “stringent” measure of activity. While it may be more compelling to determine the reaction stoichiometry for the more obviously relevant processing or joining reactions, the results reported here with the disintegration reaction represent the first successful quantitative measure of a reaction stoichiometry using any integrase assay, because the propensity of the enzyme to aggregate has precluded the use of both the processing and the joining reaction in active site titrations (9Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 10Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12099-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Additionally, the reported weak disintegration activity of the ASV catalytic core (16Bujacz G. Jaskolski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) is > 100-fold slower than the competing, nonspecific hydrolysis reaction shown in Fig. 3 B and at least 5 orders of magnitude slower than the disintegration activity reported here for the full-length enzyme (data not shown). This result, therefore, suggests that the disintegration reaction may not be as permissive as previously thought, at least for the ASV enzyme. A more substantive concern regarding the use of the disintegration assay stems from the inclusion of only one viral-end mimic in the structural design of the Y-shaped substrate. As a result, our data do not directly rule out an octameric (dimer of tetramers) model (20Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Bushman F.D. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) for the binding of two viral ends. However, as the minimum requisite set of active sites are present in a tetramer to bind both viral ends plus the target DNA, the available data likewise do not dictate any direct need to recruit additional active sites. In the absence of direct evidence for a higher order aggregate, we therefore favor the minimally sufficient tetrameric model. We note further that while the tetramer with a single Y-shaped substrate bound can accommodate the additional binding of a second viral end, the 30-Å wide groove of the tetramer is too narrow to permit the binding of a second Y-shaped substrate. Additionally, the complementary relationship between the structure of this substrate and its ability to mediate functional tetramer assembly lends compelling support for the structural and functional relevance of the disintegration substrate in modeling the active-site architecture. Our ability to complete active site titrations suggests that the presence of target DNA in the disintegration substrate mitigated protein aggregation problems observed with other DNA substrates. Alternatively, the disintegration substrate conferred sufficient binding stability to maintain active complexes at the higher NaCl concentrations required to prevent aggregation. These results suggest potential benefits from using disintegration-like substrates, containing both target and viral DNA, in structural studies of the active integrase unit to promote tetramer formation as well as to minimize non-productive aggregation. The observed substrate DNA- and metal cofactor-dependent oligomerization further suggests that the assembly of the active tetramer may be an integral and dynamic component of the catalytic pathway. The dynamic nature of the dimer-dimer interface should make it an ideal target for inhibitor design. The diketo acid family of inhibitors targeting the active site of integrase has recently been shown to inhibit the V(D)J recombinase, RAG1/2 (29Melek M. Jones J.M. O'Dea M.H. Pais G. Burke T.R., Jr. Pommier Y. Neamati N. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), important for T- and B-cell development. Recently, we have independently characterized a novel RAG1/2-like “splicing” activity of ASV integrase that further suggests that any active-site directed inhibitor of integrase could similarly interfere with V(D)J recombination (9Bao K.K. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12089-12098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). If the substrate binding-induced assembly of an active tetramer lies along the kinetic pathway of catalysis, then inhibitors that disrupt the dimer-dimer interface may provide an enzyme-specific means of disrupting catalytic activity while avoiding possible adverse effects resulting from directly targeting the active site.

https://openalex.org/W2051691075,"Sphingolipids are abundant components of eucaryotic membranes, where they perform essential functions. To uncover new roles for sphingolipids, we studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae lcb1–100 cells, which have a temperature-sensitive block in the first step in sphingolipid synthesis. We find that the level of all five species of the sphingoid long chain base intermediates is reduced 2–7-fold in cells grown at a permissive temperature, and the level of complex sphingolipids is reduced 50%. In addition, lcb1–100 cells make no detectable phosphorylated sphingoid bases. After transfer to a restrictive temperature (a heat shock), the level of the major sphingoid bases drops rather than transiently rising, as in wild type cells. These changes affectlcb1–100 cells in multiple ways. Basal uracil transport by Fur4p is reduced 25%, and when cells are heat-shocked, uracil transport activity falls rapidly and is not restored as it is in wild type cells. Restoration requires a functional secretory pathway and synthesis of complex sphingolipids, leading us to hypothesize that Fur4p associates with lipid rafts. The finding that Fur4p is insoluble in TritonX-100 at 4 °C and behaves like a raft-associated protein on a density gradient supports this hypothesis. Raft association may be essential for regulating breakdown of Fur4p in response to stresses and other factors that govern uracil transport activity. Our results show that long chain bases do not contribute to the inactivation of Fur4p transport activity after heat stress, but they are essential for some later, but unknown, process that leads to degradation of the protein. Further studies using lcb1–100 cells should reveal new roles of sphingolipids in nutrient uptake and other membrane-dependent processes."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of RB and its related proteins p107 and p130 in the G2 checkpoint is not fully understood.

This cell cycle arrest provides time for DNA repair to prevent replication or segregation of damaged DNA.

RB, p107, and p130 play a key role in negative regulation of cell cycle progression, and their growth inhibitory activity is largely attributed to their association with members of the E2F family of transcription factors (15Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 16Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). The E2F family is composed of six members, E2F-1–E2F-6, which heterodimerize with the DP proteins, DP-1 or DP-2, to form the DNA-binding, active transcription factor (15Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 16Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). E2F plays a crucial and well established role in the control of cell cycle progression mainly by up-regulating expression of genes required for the G1/S transition as well as for DNA replication (15Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar,16Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). This transcriptional activity of E2F is inhibited by its interaction with RB, p107, and p130 (15Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 16Nevins J.R.

Assembly of such repressive complexes, containing E2F and RB family members (referred to herein as E2F-RB, although they may contain p107 or p130), on promoters that have E2F-binding sites is critical for growth suppression by RB family members (17Harbour J.W.

The combination of cessation of repression of some E2F-regulated genes by the E2F-RB complex and the activation of others by activated E2F constitutes a major step in promoting G1 exit. E2F-1, -2, and -3 comprise a subgroup of the E2F family. These E2Fs are specifically regulated by RB and not by the RB-related proteins, p107 and p130. Their release from RB precedes the activation of E2F-responsive genes as well as S-phase entry (19Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and their overexpression induces quiescent cells to enter S-phase (20Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R.

E2F-4 and -5 constitute another subgroup of the E2F family. They interact also with p107 and p130 and are implicated mainly in repression of gene expression (26Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 27Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Unlike E2F-1, -2, and -3, which are constitutively nuclear, E2F-4 and -5 are found in the nucleus only in G0 and early G1, when many of the E2F-regulated genes are repressed (28Magae J., Wu, C.L.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that E2F regulates the expression of genes involved not only in cell cycle progression but also in other biological processes (33Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 34Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Many of these novel E2F targets function in various cellular responses to DNA damage, including activation of checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis, thus implicating E2F in the DNA damage response. Further support to this notion comes from recent reports demonstrating that the E2F-1 protein is stabilized and its levels are increased following DNA damage (37Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kato T. Yuan Z.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3640-3643PubMed Google Scholar, 38Blattner C. Sparks A. Lane D. Mol. Cell.

This stabilization is due to phosphorylation of E2F-1 by the protein kinase ATM, one of the master controllers of the response to DNA damage (41Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have shown that E2F up-regulates expression of a number of genes involved in entry to and progression through mitosis (33Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 35Polager S. Kalma Y. Berkovich E. Ginsberg D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the mode of regulation of these mitotic genes by E2F and the biological consequences of this regulation are not fully understood. We show here that expression of two of these mitotic genes, AIM-1 and Stathmin, is also elevated by transcriptionally inactive E2F-1, indicating that they are subjected to E2F-dependent repression. Furthermore, we show that E2F-containing complexes are required for DNA damage-induced down-regulation of AIM-1 and Stathmin. This repression of gene expression is correlated with E2F-dependent maintenance of DNA damage-induced growth arrest at G2. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Rat-1a-MT-wtE2F-1 and Rat-1a-MT-E2F-1dlTA, which are the Rat1 cell lines transfected with an inducible plasmid expressing either wild type of a dominant negative mutant of E2F-1, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and G418 (500 μg/ml). For zinc induction, cells were maintained for 48 h in medium with 0.1% serum, and then 100 μmZnCl2 were added to the medium. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 8% CO2- containing atmosphere. Activation of the E2F-1 fused to estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER-E2F-1) was induced by addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen to a final concentration of 30 nm. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Doxorubicin was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. The pSV-ψ-E-MLV packaging plasmid and pBABE-ER-E2F-1 were described previously (24Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 42Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). pBABE-E2F-1dlTA was generated by inserting the E2F-1dlTA XbaI-HindIII fragment from pRcCMV-E2F-1-(1–363) (43Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) into the pBABE-puro vector. Cells of the packaging cell line 293 were co-transfected with 10 μg of ψ ecotropic packaging plasmid, pSV-ψ-E-MLV, and 10 μg of the relevant plasmid using the calcium phosphate method in the presence of chloroquin (25 μmfinal concentration, Sigma C6628). After 8 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium, and 5 ml of retroviral-containing cell supernatant was collected at 6-h intervals. Five collections were pooled together and frozen in aliquots. For infection, NIH3T3 cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 3 ml of retroviral supernatant, supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma H9268). Then, 7 ml of medium was added, and after 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% serum and 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma P7130). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on total RNA prepared by the Tri Reagent method. For this assay, 7.5 μg of RNA was employed for cDNA synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, 200 u) and oligo(dT) (Amersham Biosciences, 0.5 μg). Following are the number of cycles, annealing temperature, and the sequences of 5′ and 3′ primers used for each of the tested genes, respectively: for the gene encoding AIM-1, 28 cycles, 58 °C using 5′-AGATTGGGCGTCCTCTGGG and 5′-TCAATCATCTCTGGGGGCAG; for the gene encoding Stathmin, 35 cycles, 58 °C using 5′-GGTGAAAGAACTGGAGAAGCG and 5′-GTGCTTATCCTTCTCTCGC; for the gene encoding ARPP-PO, 19 cycles, 58 °C using 5′-GTGGGAGCAGACAATGTGG and 5′-CAGCTGCACATCGCTCAGG; for the gene encoding GAPDH, 20 cycles, 58 °C using 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA. For nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, cell pellets were resuspended in four packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated for 15 min on ice. Cells were then lysed by adding Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.6% and vortexing. After a short centrifugation, the cytoplasmic supernatant was taken out, and the nuclear pellet was lysed in two packed cell volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. The ratio of loaded volumes of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from a given cell population was equivalent to the ratio of volumes of hypotonic and lysis buffers, respectively, and therefore it is considered as the per cell ratio of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. For whole cell extrcats, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 450 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of protein from each lysate, as determined by Bradford assay, were resolved by electrophoresis through an SDS 7.5–12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a filter (Protran BA 85, Schleicher & Schüll). Filters were incubated with a primary antibody for 2 h, after 1 h blocking in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk. Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti E2F-1 (sc-251, Santa Cruz), anti-RB (14001A, PharMingen), anti-p130 (sc-317, Santa Cruz), anti-AIM-1 (BD Biosciences), anti-Stathmin (STC, gift of Andre Sobel), anti-E2F-4 (sc-866 Santa Cruz), and anti-B23 (sc-6013, Santa Cruz). Binding of the primary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Cells were trypsinized and fixed with methanol (−20 °C). After fixation, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm, resuspended in PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After recentrifugation cells were resuspended in PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer. Approximately 108 cells were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde directly to the growth medium (final concentration 1%). Cross-linking was stopped after 10 min at room temperature by the addition of glycine (final concentration: 0.125 m). Cross-linked cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, scrapped, washed with PBS, and then resuspended in buffer I (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.25% Triton X-100). Cells were pelleted by microcentrifugation and then resuspended in buffer II (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 200 mm NaCl). After microcentrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). The resulting chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 1000 bp and then microcentrifuged. The supernatant was diluted 1:10 with dilution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and divided into aliquots. After preclearing with blocked protein A-Sepharose beads, 1 μg of antibody was added to each aliquot of chromatin and incubated on a rotating platform overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with blocked protein A-Sepharose beads. Following extensive washing, bound DNA fragments were eluted and analyzed by subsequent PCR. Antibodies used were as follows: anti-E2F-4 (sc-866, Santa Cruz) and anti-p130 (sc-317, Santa Cruz). Primers used for PCR were for Stathmin promoter (forward) 5′-ACAAGCTGCCGTGTGTCCG-3′ and (reverse) 5′-CTGGAGAGAAGCATTTCGGG-3′ and for β-actin (forward) 5′-ACTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCAGC-3′. Our initial studies aimed at understanding the regulation of mitotic genes by E2F focused on one of these E2F-regulated mitotic genes, Stathmin (also known as oncoprotein 18), which encodes a protein involved in microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly (44Cassimeris L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). To determine whether Stathmin is a direct target of E2F, we infected NIH3T3 cells with a retrovirus carrying E2F-1 fused to the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER-E2F-1). The ER-E2F-1 is expressed as an inactive fusion protein, which is activated upon addition of the ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (24Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As was previously reported by Ishidaet al. (33Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) induction of E2F-1 led to an increase in Stathmin mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, a similar E2F1-induced increase in Stathmin mRNA levels was detected in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 1 A). These data indicate thatde novo protein synthesis is not required for E2F1-induced up-regulation of the Stathmin mRNA, suggesting that Stathmin is a direct target of E2F. The observed E2F1-induced up-regulation of Stathmin may be due to either activation or derepression. To distinguish between these two possibilities we analyzed the expression of Stathmin in cells containing an inducible wild type E2F-1, or mutant E2F-1, E2F-1dlTA. This truncated E2F-1dlTA lacks both the transactivation and the RB-binding domains, and when overexpressed it can negate both activation of gene expression by E2F and repression by E2F-RB complexes. Once again, induction of wtE2F-1 resulted in an increase in Stathmin mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, induction of E2F-1dlTA led to a similar increase in Stathmin mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). wt and mutant E2F-1 were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1 C). Expression of other E2F-regulated mitotic genes, including Cdc2, BUB1b, EB1, and SAK-a, was similarly up-regulated by both wtE2F-1 (35Polager S. Kalma Y. Berkovich E. Ginsberg D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and E2F-1dlTA (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that Stathmin, as well as other mitotic genes, is under E2F-dependent negative regulation. A physiological setting in which such negative regulation may be important is during growth arrest in response to DNA damage. Low doses of DNA-damaging agents induce cellular growth arrest, and we analyzed the effects of such a treatment on expression of both Stathmin and another E2F-regulated mitotic gene, AIM-1. AIM-1(aurora and Ipl-1-like midbody-associated protein kinase, also called aurora1 or STK12) is a serine/threonine kinase required for cytokinesis (reviewed in Refs. 45Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar and 46Terada Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Following addition of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, NIH3T3 cells underwent growth arrest at the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 2 A). This DNA damage-induced growth arrest was already apparent 24 h after doxorubicin addition and persisted for at least 72 h. The growth arrest was accompanied by accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB and p130 (Fig. 2 B). In addition, treatment with doxorubicin led to a significant decrease in mRNA levels of Stathmin and AIM-1 (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained using HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells (data not shown). The decrease in mRNA levels of the studied genes could be detected 24 h after treatment and was most evident at 48 h (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the increase in hypophosphorylated RB and p130, which are the growth repressive forms, coincided with or preceded the down-regulation of Stathmin and AIM-1. This result raises the possibility that complexes containing either RB or p130 mediate the repression of Stathmin and AIM-1 in response to DNA damage. Next we tested whether E2F mediates the decrease in expression of these mitotic genes in response to DNA damage. To this end, NIH3T3 cells were infected with retroviruses containing either E2F-1dlTA or an empty vector and then treated with doxorubicin. As shown earlier for uninfected cells (Fig. 2), in vector-infected NIH3T3 cells, the doxorubicin-induced growth arrest was accompanied by a significant increase in levels of hypophosphorylated RB and p130 (Fig. 3 B). In addition, as shown earlier for uninfected cells, treatment of empty vector-infected NIH3T3 cells with doxorubicin led to a decrease in mRNA levels of the E2F-regulated genes, AIM-1 and Stathmin (Fig. 3 A). A similar doxorubicin-induced decrease was detected in protein levels of AIM-1 and Stathmin (Fig. 3 B). Expression of E2F1-dlTA did not significantly affect the doxorubicin-induced accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB and p130; however, it abolished the decrease in mRNA and protein levels of AIM-1 and Stathmin (Fig. 3, Aand B). Thus, in cells expressing E2F1-dlTA, levels of AIM-1 and Stathmin remained unchanged throughout the experiment. Following doxorubicin addition, cells infected with an empty vector, similarly to uninfected cells, arrested at the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. This arrest at G1 and G2/M persisted for at least 96 h (Fig. 3 C). Expression of E2F-1dlTA did not result in noticeable changes in cell cycle distribution of untreated cells; however, it had profound effects on cell cycle distribution after treatment with doxorubicin. Cells expressing E2F-1dlTA failed to arrest at G1 and accumulated at G2/M. Interestingly, growth arrest at G2/M was not maintained, the percentage of cells at G2/M gradually decreased, and a concomitant increase in cells with <2 n and >4 n DNA content was detected (Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that while E2F is not essential for the initiation of G2/M arrest, it is required for its maintenance. To study more directly the role of E2F-RB complexes in the response to DNA damage, we tested the effect of their dissociation by the papilloma virus E7 protein. To this end, NIH3T3 cells were infected with a retrovirus containing either an empty vector, the wtE7 gene of HPV16, or a mutated E7, E7Δ21–35, which does not bind RB family members. The wt and mutated E7 were expressed at similar levels (data not shown); however, expression of wtE7, but not E7Δ21–35, inhibited the doxorubicin-induced decrease in protein levels of AIM-1 and Stathmin (Fig. 4 A). In addition, expression of wtE7 led to profound changes in cell cycle distribution after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 4 B). The effects of wtE7 expression were highly similar to those of E2F-1dlTA and included: 1) failure of cells to arrest at G1 and their accumulation at G2/M; 2) inability to maintain growth arrest at G2/M, with a gradual decrease in the percentage of cells at G2/M and an increase in cells with <2 n and >4 n DNA content (Fig. 4 B). Expression of E7Δ21–35 had no apparent effect on cell cycle distribution after DNA damage (Fig. 4 B). These findings suggest that endogenous E2F-RB complexes mediate repression of mitotic genes and sustained G2/M arrest in response to DNA damage. To identify the distinct members of the E2F and RB families that mediate the repression of E2F-regulated genes in response to DNA damage we performed a ChIP using antibodies directed against specific family members. The human Stathmin promoter contains three putative E2F-binding sites at positions −28, −577, and −701 upstream to the transcription start site (47Melhem R.F. Zhu X.X. Hailat N. Strahler J.R. Hanash S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and our analysis of the murine Stathmin promoter indicates that it too contains three putative E2F-binding sites. Taken together with our observation that E2F-induced up-regulation of Stathmin does not require de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1 A), this sequence information suggests that E2Fs may interact with the S"
https://openalex.org/W2120351357,"Upon activation with various noncytokine stimuli, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) mobilize intracellular sialidase to the plasma membrane, where the sialidase releases sialic acid from the cell surface. This desialylation enhances PMN adherence, spreading, deformability, and motility, functions critical to diapedesis. We now have examined the role of sialidase activity in PMN adhesion to and migration across the endothelium in vivo. A polyclonal antibody prepared against Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase 1) detected surface expression of sialidase on human PMNs stimulated with IL-8 in vitro and on murine PMNs stimulated in vivo, but not on that of unstimulated cells, 2) recognized proteins in human PMN lysates and granule preparations that were not detected by preimmune antibody, 3) inhibited bacterial neuraminidase and human PMN sialidase activities in vitro, and 4) inhibited both pulmonary leukostasis in mice systemically infused with cobra venom factor and intrapulmonary transendothelial migration of PMNs into the bronchoalveolar compartment of mice intranasally challenged with interleukin-8. We conclude that the chemokine interleukin-8, like other PMN agonists, induces the translocation of sialidase to the PMN surface and that surface expression of this sialidase is a prerequisite to PMN recruitment in vivo. The ability of antibodies raised against a prokaryotic neuraminidase to recognize eukaryotic sialidase extends the concept of the neuraminidase superfamily to mammalian enzymes. Inhibition of mobilized endogenous sialidase may provide a novel strategy for limiting the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2023604509,"We have demonstrated previously that a proximal element within the human α2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) promoter mediates transcriptional repression by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and designated this region the IFN-γ response element (IgRE). Screening of a human fibroblast cDNA expression library with a radiolabeled IgRE probe exclusively yielded clones with a sequence identical to that of the transcription factor YB-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using various IgRE-derived oligonucleotide probes containing serial two-base mutations showed that YB-1 protein was preferentially bound to the pyrimidine-rich sequence within the IgRE. This region is located immediately downstream of and partly overlaps the previously reported Sp1/Sp3 binding site. Overexpression of YB-1 in human dermal fibroblasts decreased steady state levels of COL1A2 mRNA and repressedCOL1A2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of YB-1 on COL1A2 expression was abolished by mutations of the IgRE shown to prevent YB-1 binding in EMSA. In addition, these mutations also abolished the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ, suggesting that YB-1 mediates the inhibitory action of IFN-γ on COL1A2 promoter through its binding to the IgRE. Also, overexpression of a deletion mutant YB-1, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal domain, abrogated the repression ofCOL1A2 transcription by IFN-γ. A functional correlation between IFN-γ and YB-1 was further supported by luciferase assays using four tandem repeats of the Y-box consensus oligonucleotide linked to a minimal promoter. EMSA and Western blot analysis using cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins implied that IFN-γ promotes the nuclear translocation of YB-1. Direct evidence for the nuclear translocation of YB-1 by IFN-γ was further provided by using a YB-1-green fluorescent protein expression plasmid transfected into human fibroblasts. Altogether, this study represents the definitive identification of the transcription factor responsible for IFN-γ-elicited inhibition of COL1A2 expression, namely YB-1. We have demonstrated previously that a proximal element within the human α2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) promoter mediates transcriptional repression by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and designated this region the IFN-γ response element (IgRE).

A functional correlation between IFN-γ and YB-1 was further supported by luciferase assays using four tandem repeats of the Y-box consensus oligonucleotide linked to a minimal promoter. EMSA and Western blot analysis using cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins implied that IFN-γ promotes the nuclear translocation of YB-1. Direct evidence for the nuclear translocation of YB-1 by IFN-γ was further provided by using a YB-1-green fluorescent protein expression plasmid transfected into human fibroblasts. Altogether, this study represents the definitive identification of the transcription factor responsible for IFN-γ-elicited inhibition of COL1A2 expression, namely YB-1.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Regulation of connective tissue formation is under rigorous control by cytokines, which act in concert to ensure tissue integrity during homeostasis, development and repair (1Mauviel A. Uitto J. Wounds. 1993; 5: 137-152Google Scholar). These cytokines have been shown to control connective tissue cell recruitment and proliferation, as well as synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix components (2Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Disruption of this equilibrium, leading to excessive collagen deposition, is the hallmark of interstitial fibrotic diseases. Type I collagen mRNA levels are increased in experimental and clinical fibrotic states (3Scharffetter K. Lankat-Buttgereit B. Kreig T. Eur. J. Clin.

Several studies have previously indicated possible mechanisms by which tumor necrosis factor-α inhibits α2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) expression at the transcriptional level (7Inagaki Y. Truter S.

Tumor necrosis factor-α has also been demonstrated to antagonize the effects of TGF-β through induction of inhibitory Smad7 (10Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar) or AP-1 components (11Verrecchia F. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30226-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, identification of the transcription factors involved in interferon-γ-elicited down-regulation ofCOL1A2 expression has been elusive, except that a cross-talk between TGF-β/Smad and IFN-γ/Stat1 signaling pathways has recently been implicated in antagonistic regulation of gene transcription (12Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11041-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We have previously identified a proximal element within the humanCOL1A2 promoter, spanning nucleotide −161 to −150, that mediates transcriptional repression by IFN-γ. We designated this region the IFN-γ response element (IgRE) (13Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.-J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking experiments using nuclear extracts prepared from IFN-γ-treated fibroblast cultures indicated that two DNA-protein complexes were formed with the IgRE (13Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.-J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, others have shown that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to a TCCCCC motif located between −164 and −159 (14Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), immediately upstream of and partly overlapping the IgRE. In the present study, we attempted to characterize the human fibroblast nuclear protein that interacts with the IgRE by screening of a human fibroblast cDNA expression library. We have identified the transcription factor YB-1 as a component of the COL1A2transrepressing complex bound to the IgRE. Cotransfection studies using a YB-1 expression vector and reporter constructs containing the wild-type and mutated COL1A2 IgRE have confirmed the role of YB-1 as a negative regulator of COL1A2 transcription mediating the effect of IFN-γ. A λgt 11 human dermal fibroblast cDNA library (Clontech) was screened by Southwestern blotting using the 32P-labeled three repeats of the IgRE oligonucleotide spanning −161 to −150 of the human COL1A2 promoter as described previously (15Vinson R.C. LaMarco L.K. Johnson F.P. Landschulz H.W. McKnight L.S. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The filters were subjected to a cycle of denaturation with 6 mguanidine hydrochloride followed by renaturation before screening. After incubation with 5% skim milk in the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgC12, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 4 °C, the filters were probed in the binding buffer containing 106 cpm/ml probe, 10 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.25% powdered milk. The positive clones were sequenced directly using λgt 11 primers (Takara Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan). Point mutations were introduced into the YB-1 binding sites using mutational polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (16Boast S. Su M.W. Ramirez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The constructs −161M1/luc and −161M5/luc containing two-base pair substitution mutations (5′-CCCATTCGCTCC-3′ to 5′-CGGATTCGCTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCATTCGCGGC-3′, respectively) were prepared by inserting the mutated promoter sequences into a firefly luciferase gene vector, pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Four copies of the Y-box consensus oligonucleotide (CTGATTGGCTAA) linked to a minimal promoter containing only a TATA box were cloned into pGL3 basic vector. A YB-1 expression plasmid, YB-1/RSV, was constructed by ligating the entire YB-1 coding sequence into the HindIII/XbaI sites of pRc/RSV vector (Invitrogen). A deletion mutant YB-1 expression plasmid, which lacks the carboxyl terminus, was constructed by ligating the corresponding sequences into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). The pCMX-YB-1-GFP was prepared by ligating the YB-1 sequence into theHindIII/PmlI sites of pCMX-hGR-GFP (kindly provided by Dr. H. Ogawa, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (18Ogawa H. Umesono K. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 31: 303-308Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sequences of all plasmids were verified by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Normal human dermal fibroblasts (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and lysed in lysis buffer (Promega). Aliquots containing the identical amounts of protein, as measured with a commercial assay kit (BioRad), were subjected to luciferase assays. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fifty nanograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using ImProm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega). A pair of gene-specific PCR oligonucleotide primers and an oligonucleotide probe labeled with a reporter fluorescent dye at the 5′-end and a quencher fluorescent dye at the 3′-end were designed according to the guidelines suggested in the TaqMan model 5700 sequence detection instrument manual (Applied Biosystems). The human COL1A2 primers and probe used are as follows: forward primer, 5′-CCAGAGTGGAGCAGTGGTTACTACT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTCTTGGCTGGGATGTTTTCA-3′; and probe, 5′-CTACTGGCGAAACCTGTATCCGGGC-3′. The human YB-1 primers and probe used are as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCGCCAAAGACAGCCTAGAGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCTGCGTCGGTAATTGAAGTTG-3′; and probe, 5′-TCAGCAGCCACCTCAACGTCGGTA-3′. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene primer and probe mixture from the predeveloped TaqMan assay reagents (Applied Biosystems) was used. The thermal cycling condition included 1 cycle at 50 °C for 5 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. Standard curves for expression of each gene were generated by serial dilution of cDNA prepared from human fibroblasts. The relative mRNA expression levels ofCOL1A2 and YB-1 genes were normalized against those ofGAPDH gene in the same RNA preparation. Recombinant YB-1 protein was produced using the pET system (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described previously (19Takai T. Nishita Y. Ariga S. Ariga H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5576-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, after transformation of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with YB-1/pET-28a(+) expression vector, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to LB medium at 0.5 A 600 followed by incubation for another 3 h. The induced cells were collected and sonicated until no longer viscous. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and recombinant (His)6-YB-1 was eluted with the buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Purity of the expressed YB-1 fusion product was ascertained by analytic SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). For EMSA, the probes (∼50,000 cpm) were incubated with recombinant YB-1 protein or nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice in 20 μl of binding reaction buffer as described previously (21Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, 20–500-fold molar excess of unlabeled IgRE or consensus sequences for YB-1 (22Stein U. Jurchott K. Walther W. Bergmann S. Schlag P.M. Royer H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28562-28569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and Sp1/Sp3 (23Ihn H. Tamaki K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were added to the binding reaction. In some experiments, antibody interference assays were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with 2 μg of anti-YB-1 polyclonal antibodies prepared against the 15-amino acid peptide (residues 299–313) of YB-1 as previously reported (24Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar) or with anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Twenty micrograms of nuclear proteins or 40 μg of cytoplasmic proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted, and incubated with anti-YB-1 antibodies. ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect immunoreactive proteins. Thirty-six hours after transfection with 1 μg of pCMV-YB-1-GFP using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml IFN-γ was added into the culture medium and incubated for another 6 h. After removing the media, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and examined under a microscope (Nikkon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set for fluorescence detection (18Ogawa H. Umesono K. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 31: 303-308Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Values were expressed as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between groups, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. A human dermal fibroblast cDNA library cloned into λgt 11 was screened using three tandem repeats of the IgRE (−161 to −150) as a probe. After screening ∼5 × 106 plaques, we obtained three positive clones. Direct sequence analyses of the three clones revealed overlapping subregions of the cDNA encoding YB-1, a member of the Y-box transcription factor family (data not shown). TheCOL1A2 IgRE sequence aligned in 7 of 12 bases with the consensus Y-box sequence (Fig. 1 A). Although YB-1 was identified originally as a transcription factor bound specifically to the Y-box sequence containing a CCAAT motif (25Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zaceis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), it has also been shown to bind to pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides that can adopt an intramolecular triplex, single-stranded structure (26Kolluri R. Torrey A.T. Kinniburgh J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The IgRE within the human COL1A2 promoter possesses both the Y-box-like element and the pyrimidine-rich sequence (Fig. 1 A). To examine the binding specificity of YB-1 to the IgRE, a (His)6-YB-1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and used for gel mobility shift assays. Various double-stranded oligonucleotides containing serial two-base mutations or single-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes to determine the recognition targets of YB-1 (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 C, recombinant YB-1 effectively bound to both the double-stranded (ds WT) and the sense single-stranded (ss-S WT) IgRE, whereas complex formation was not observed between YB-1 and the antisense single-stranded (ss-AS WT) IgRE. To further characterize DNA sequences involved in complex formation between YB-1 and double-stranded IgRE, a series of oligonucleotides containing substitution mutations were used as probes in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1 C, M1 and M5 oligonucleotide probes completely failed to form the YB-1·DNA complexes, and M3 and M4 probes showed markedly diminished complex formation. In contrast, introduction of mutations into–158A−157T (M2) had no effect on the binding of YB-1 to the IgRE. These results suggest that both–160C−159C and–152T−151C bases were most essential for YB-1 binding to the IgRE. To determine whether endogenous YB-1 binds to the IgRE, we next performed EMSA using nuclear extracts prepared from human fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 2 A, incubation of nuclear extracts with double-stranded IgRE probe yielded at least four retarded bands (arrows 1–4), all of which were diminished by the addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled double-stranded competitor. Interestingly, although formation of the three slowly migrating complexes (arrows 1–3) was completely abolished by adding a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded competitor, the faster migrating complex (arrow 4) was still observed even after adding a 500-fold molar excess of the competitor. These results suggested that the binding affinities of those nuclear proteins to the IgRE are different from each other. In addition, unlabeled sense single-stranded IgRE interfered with the formation of complex 4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A), whereas it did not affect complexes 1–3. On the other hand, antisense single-stranded IgRE as a competitor failed to diminish the formation of complex 4 (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrated that the nuclear factor(s) forming complex 4 preferentially bind to both the double- and the sense single-stranded IgRE. Considering the results shown in Fig. 1 C, we then tested the possibility that YB-1 interacts with the IgRE to form complex 4. For this purpose, we generated anti-YB-1 antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of YB-1, which inhibited the binding of recombinant YB-1 to the IgRE (Fig. 2 B). Preincubation of nuclear extracts with anti-YB-1 antibodies resulted in significant but partial inhibition of the complex 4 formation (Fig. 2 B). With regard to the slowly migrating complexes 1–3, a previous study indicated the binding of Sp1/Sp3 to the −164 to −159COL1A2 sequence, immediately upstream of and partly overlapping the IgRE (23Ihn H. Tamaki K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistent with their results, the formation of complex 1 was interfered with by anti-Sp1 antibodies and that of complexes 2 and 3 was abolished by adding anti-Sp3 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, in agreement with the results of Fig. 1 C, M1 and M5 oligonucleotides as a probe hardly formed the YB-1·IgRE complex (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, interruption of YB-1 binding to the IgRE augmented the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the IgRE (Fig. 2 C). To confirm the transcriptional repression of COL1A2 expression by YB-1, we first performed real-time RT-PCR assays using Taqman probes. As shown in Fig. 3 A, expression of YB-1 suppressed endogenous COL1A2 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. We then examined whether the binding of YB-1 to the IgRE is necessary for the regulation ofCOL1A2 promoter activity. To this end, we transfected human dermal fibroblasts with either the wild-type −161WT or with mutated −161M1 and −161M5 reporter plasmids together with a YB-1 expression plasmid. The basal transcription level of −161M1 was significantly higher than that of −161WT, whereas the basal transcription level of −161M5 was not statistically different from that of −161WT (Fig. 3 B). Overexpression of YB-1 significantly decreased transcription of −161WT construct by about 50% in human dermal fibroblasts. In contrast, the promoter activities of both the −161M1 and −161M5 constructs, which lack the YB-1 binding sequence within the IgRE, were not affected by overexpression of YB-1 (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results suggest that YB-1 is able to suppress COL1A2 gene expression and that the inhibitory action is exerted via a promoter region identified previously as the IgRE (13Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.-J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results described above led us to investigate the role of YB-1 in mediating the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ onCOL1A2 promoter activity. We first performed real-time RT-PCR assays to confirm the transcriptional repression ofCOL1A2 by IFN-γ. As shown in Fig. 3 C, IFN-γ significantly suppressed endogenous COL1A2 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the levels of endogenous YB-1 mRNA remained unchanged, indicating that IFN-γ-elicited inhibition of COL1A2 transcription is independent of de novo synthesis of YB-1. Then, the mutated constructs −161M1 and −161M5, as well as their wild-type counterpart −161WT, were used in transient transfection experiments. Consistent with the results of our previous study (13Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.-J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), IFN-γ exerted a significant transcriptional inhibition of the wild-type −161WT construct by about 50%. In contrast, the point mutations introduced into both –160C−159C nucleotides (–161M1) and–155T−154C nucleotides (–161M5) prevented the COL1A2 response to IFN-γ (Fig. 3 D). These results clearly demonstrate that the YB-1 binding site within the 12-base-pair IgRE is essential for IFN-γ responsiveness. To further confirm that YB-1 is involved inCOL1A2 repression by IFN-γ, we generated a deletion mutant YB-1 expression plasmid, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal region compared with the full-length YB-1 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3 E, transcriptional repression of COL1A2by IFN-γ was strengthened further by overexpression of YB-1. On the other hand, overexpression of the mutant YB-1 abrogated theCOL1A2 repression by IFN-γ while keeping the basal transcription levels unchanged (Fig. 3 E). These results clearly demonstrated that YB-1 not only regulates the COL1A2transcription but also mediates IFN-γ elicited repression ofCOL1A2 transcription. To determine whether IFN-γ exerts its inhibitory effect solely through the YB-1 biding site or circumvents any additional non-YB-1-specific cis-elements, we constructed (YB-1)4-luciferase reporter plasmid in which four tandem repeats of the consensus Y-box sequence were linked to a minimal promoter containing only a TATA box. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of YB-1 decreased (YB-1)4-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, a dose-dependent diminution of (YB-1)4-luciferase activity was also observed by changing the concentration of IFN-γ in culture medium (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that IFN-γ exerts its inhibitory action specifically through the Y-box sequence. The results described above led us to investigate the IFN-γ-induced alterations in the relative amount and binding ability of YB-1 to the IgRE. We first evaluated alterations in the relative amount of YB-1 in response to IFN-γ using Western blot analysis. Twenty micrograms of nuclear proteins or 40 μg of cytoplasmic proteins prepared from cells either untreated or treated with IFN-γ for various lengths of time were coelectrophoresed with recombinant YB-1. The amount of YB-1 present in nuclear extracts was significantly increased by IFN-γ treatment for more than 4 h (Fig. 5 A,upper panel). Inversely, the amount of YB-1 present in cytoplasmic extracts was obviously decreased (Fig. 5 A,lower panel). Then we analyzed IFN-γ-induced alterations in the binding ability of YB-1 to the IgRE using EMSA. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the intensity of the YB-1·IgRE complex was increased remarkably by IFN-γ treatment. In contrast, the intensities of both the Sp1·IgRE and Sp3·IgRE complexes remained unchanged (data not shown). Furthermore, Southwestern blot analysis using IgRE as a probe showed that the intensity of the band estimated at ∼50 kDa, which is almost identical to the size of YB-1, was significantly increased by IFN-γ treatment for more than 4 h (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrated that IFN-γ promotes the nuclear translocation of YB-1 followed by its binding to the IgRE. To demonstrate directly the nuclear translocation of YB-1 by IFN-γ, human dermal fibroblasts were transfected with 1 μg of YB-1-GFP expression plasmid and treated with 100 units/ml IFN-γ. YB-1-GFP fusion protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm of untreated cells, whereas nuclear translocation of YB-1-GFP was observed as early as 4 h after exposure to IFN-γ (Fig. 6).Figure 6IFN-γ-induced nuclear translocation of YB-1. Human dermal fibroblasts were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-YB-1-GFP expression plasmid. Six hours after transfection, the cells were placed in medium supplemented with 10% FCS. After incubation for 40 h, the cells were left untreated (A) or treated (B) with 100 units/ml IFN-γ for 4 h. Then the cells were examined under a microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set for fluorescence detection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have demonstrated previously that a proximal region of the human COL1A2 promoter is essential for mediating the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ and designated this region the IFN-γ response element, IgRE (13Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.-J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the current study, by screening a human fibroblast cDNA expression library, we identified YB-1 as a transcription factor that interacts with the IgRE. Both bacterially expressed recombinant protein and endogenous YB-1 present in fibroblast nuclear extracts exhibited high affinity for the IgRE. Transient transfection assays demonstrated that expression of YB-1 decreasedCOL1A2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner and that IFN-γ suppressed gene transcription through YB-1 binding to the IgRE. Experiments using the carboxyl domain-deleted YB-1 confirmed the role of YB-1 in COL1A2 repression by IFN-γ. Furthermore, a combination of Western blot analysis, EMSA of nuclear proteins, and GFP fluorescence study demonstrated that IFN-γ treatment translocates YB-1 into the nucleus and increases the binding of YB-1 to the IgRE sequence. Ihn and co-workers (14Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Ihn H. Tamaki K. J. Invest.

Using transient transfection assays, they also showed that this pyrimidine-rich motif is a binding site for a transcriptional repressor (14Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol.

However, since the blockade of Sp1/Sp3 binding to the repressor site did not affect the collagen promoter activity (23Ihn H. Tamaki K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the functional role of Sp1/Sp3 interacting with the TCCCCC motif has not been fully understood. Our present study has clearly indicated that the IgRE (−161 to −150), immediately downstream of and partly overlapping the Sp1/Sp3 binding site, is a binding site for a COL1A2repressor, YB-1. Indeed, Ihn et al. (28Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) introduced a substitution mutation into −161 CCC −159within the TCCCCC motif, which was almost comparable with our M1 mutation, and this resulted in a 6-fold increase in the basal promoter activity. Functional assays using four tandem repeats of the YB-1 consensus sequence indicated that IFN-γ exerts its inhibitory action onCOL1A2 transcription solely through the YB-1 binding site (Fig. 4). It should be noted, however, that the binding of Sp1/Sp3 was markedly enhanced when using the mutated IgRE sequences (M1 and M5) as EMSA probes (Fig. 2 C). YB-1 has been shown to interact with other transcription factors and viral proteins (29Safak M. Gallia G.L. Ansari S.A. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10146-10157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chernukhin I.V. Shaharum S. Robinson A.F. Carne A.F. Paul A. El Kady A.I. Lobanenkov V.V. Klenova E.M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6194-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, a previous study has suggested that the level of Sp1 activity dictates binding of YB-1 to its target sequence and therefore affects its regulatory function (32Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, it could be argued that YB-1 and Sp1/Sp3 regulate COL1A2 transcription through their physical interactions and/or competitive binding to the adjacent IgRE and the TCCCCC motif. In contrast to the mutation introduced into–160C−159C, the other substitution mutation introduced into another essential YB-1 binding site (–155T−154C) did not affect the basal promoter activity (Fig. 3). We suggested previously (13Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.-J. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that a protein with size estimated at ∼30 kDa definitely interacts with the IgRE through the –155T−154C nucleotides and acts as a transactivator. It is therefore possible that the lack of binding of both YB-1 and the 30-kDa protein did not affect promoter activity. In addition, Southwestern blot analyses showed that IFN-γ treatment increased YB-1 binding to the IgRE, whereas it had no effect on the binding of the 30-kDa protein (data not shown). Altogether, reciprocal interactions between YB-1, Sp1/Sp3, and the 30-kDa protein might be required for regulation of COL1A2 transcription by IFN-γ. The significant but partial inhibition of YB-1·IgRE complex formation by adding anti-YB-1 antibodies (Fig. 2 B) may indicate that the 30-kDa protein interacts with YB-1 and interfere with its antibody recognition. The nature of the 30-kDa protein as well as the mechanisms of its functional interaction with YB-1 also remain to be elucidated. It has been shown that chk-YB-1b, a chicken homologue of human YB-1, binds to a pyrimidine-rich sequence and activates the rat α1(I) procollagen gene (COL1A1) transcription (33Dhalla A.K. Ririe S.S. Swamynathan S.K. Weber K.T. Guntaka R.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the nucleic acid binding domain and the carboxyl terminus of chk-YB-1b display a high degree of homology with those of human YB-1. In contrast, the sequence of the amino-terminal domain, which may influence the ability of the protein to interact with other nucleic acid binding proteins, is the most structurally distinct portion (34Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4186-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Norman et al. (35Norman J.T. Lindahl G.E. Shakib K. En Nia A. Yilmaz E. Mertens P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29880-29890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have shown that YB-1 overexpression suppresses endogenous COL1A1 expression and collagen protein production in rodent cells. Sequence analysis of the mouseCOL1A1 promoter revealed three putative YB-1 binding sites, −83/–72, −103/–92, and −129/–118, all of which are well conserved in human (35Norman J.T. Lindahl G.E. Shakib K. En Nia A. Yilmaz E. Mertens P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29880-29890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, Yuan et al. (36Yuan W. Yufit T. Li L. Mori Y. Chen S.-J. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have demonstrated transcriptional inhibition of human COL1A1expression by IFN-γ and located the IFN-γ response element between nucleotides −129 and −109 of the human COL1A1 promoter. In the present study, we have shown that YB-1 suppresses transcription of human COL1A2 gene and that IFN-γ inhibits gene transcription via the YB-1 binding site. Taken together, these results suggest that IFN-γ/YB-1 signaling may coordinately down-regulate bothCOL1A1 and COL1A2 gene transcription. Consensus sequence for translocation of proteins to the nucleus does not exist in YB-1. However, nuclear translocation signals are located in its carboxyl terminus, which typically contain a cluster of three to six basic residues in a short peptide of four to nine amino acids (25Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zaceis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In this study, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of YB-1 containing those nuclear translocation signals resulted in an abrogation of COL1A2 repression by IFN-γ. Recently, Stenina et al. (37Stenina O.I. Shaneyfelt K.M. DiCorleto P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7277-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have suggested that thrombin induces the release of YB-1 from mRNA by proteolytic cleavage and the truncated YB-1 is translocated into the nucleus and bound to the thrombin response element (CCACCCACC) in endothelial cells. However, Western blot analyses using an amino-terminally Flag-tagged YB-1 expression vector failed to show degradation of YB-1 following IFN-γ treatment of human fibroblasts (data not shown). In contrast, a previous study using human cancer cells showed that the nuclear translocation of YB-1 is induced by UV irradiation or anticancer drugs like cisplatin in a protein kinase C-dependent manner (38Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our results showed that treatment with 100 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate also initiated the nuclear translocation of YB-1 in human fibroblasts (data not shown). These results may suggest that some of the IFN-γ-induced biological events, such as the induction of YB-1 translocation or the inhibition of type I collagen gene expression, are mediated through the protein kinase C pathway (39Reano A. Viac J. Richard M.H. Schmitt D. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1997; 289: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 40Lin Y.H. Martino J.L. Wilcox D.B. Davis B.F. Gordinier K.J. Davis J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 843-849PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which IFN-γ initiates the nuclear translocation of YB-1 is currently under investigation. Altogether, this study represents the definitive identification of the transcription factor responsible for IFN-γ-elicited inhibition ofCOL1A2 expression, namely YB-1. Future studies aimed at the characterization of the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of type I collagen gene expression by YB-1 may provide a novel insight into the interstitial fibrotic diseases and eventually contribute to the development of useful therapeutic means.

Their extreme C-terminal polar residues are translocated across membranes by poorly understood post-translational mechanism(s). Here we have used the yeast system to study translocation of the C terminus of a tagged form of mammalian cytochromeb 5, carrying an N-glycosylation site in its C-terminal domain (b 5-Nglyc). Utilization of this site was adopted as a rigorous criterion for translocation across the ER membrane of yeast wild-type and mutant cells. The C terminus of b 5-Nglyc was rapidly glycosylated in mutants where Sec61p was defective and incapable of translocating carboxypeptidase Y, a well known substrate for post-translational translocation. Likewise, inactivation of several other components of the translocon machinery had no effect onb 5-Nglyc translocation. The kinetics of translocation were faster for b 5-Nglyc than for a signal peptide-containing reporter. Depletion of the cellular ATP pool to a level that retarded Sec61p-dependent post-translational translocation still allowed translocation ofb 5-Nglyc. Similarly, only low ATP concentrations (below 1 μm), in addition to cytosolic protein(s), were required for in vitro translocation ofb 5-Nglyc into mammalian microsomes.

A large number of TA proteins have been described in animal, plant, and fungal cells, where their roles range from regulation of apoptosis to enzyme catalysis, translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides across membranes, vesicular traffic (see Refs. 1Borgese N. D'Arrigo A., De Silvestris M. Pietrini G. Borgese N. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1993: 313-341Google Scholar and 2Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Google Scholar for reviews), and control of gene expression (3Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Google Scholar). Consistent with these different functions, TA proteins are found on a variety of membranes, such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and of the Golgi complex, the plasma membrane and the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mitochondrial targeting occurs directly from the cytosol (4Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2482-2496Google Scholar), whereas TA proteins located in membranes of the exo- and endocytic pathways are first inserted into the ER and then transported to their destinations by membrane traffic (5Jäntti J.

Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Google Scholar). A point that remained controversial for many years was whether TA proteins are bona fide transmembrane proteins, with the C-terminal residues exposed at the exoplasmic side of the membrane, or rather have a hairpin configuration with the hydrophobic stretch looping back to the cytosolic face of the bilayer. The difficulty in distinguishing between these alternatives was because of the small number of polar residues downstream to the hydrophobic domain, so that traditional approaches, such as protection from proteolysis or accessibility to antibodies, did not yield clear results (see Ref. 1Borgese N. D'Arrigo A., De Silvestris M. Pietrini G. Borgese N. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1993: 313-341Google Scholar). In the past few years, however, the use of recombinant proteins withN-glycosylation sites appended at the C terminus has allowed unequivocal demonstration that TA proteins can acquire transmembrane topology by translocating their C terminus across the ER membrane (6Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilgen G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Google Scholar,9Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16939-16944Google Scholar, 10Honsho M. Mitoma J.-y. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20860-20866Google Scholar, 11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar). Using glycosylation as a criterion for translocation, a variety of different C-terminal sequences, deriving from cytosolic or exoplasmic portions of different proteins, have been shown to be translocated, indicating that the translocation process is not very selective with regard to the residues that are transferred to the ER lumen. The transmembrane segment of TA proteins emerges from the ribosome only upon completion of translation; thus, translocation of the C terminus must be post-translational, as has been directly demonstrated (6Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilgen G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Google Scholar, 11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process has not been clarified so far. Studies addressing this question have employedin vitro systems in which tight (alkaline pH-resistant) association of the protein under study to added membranes or proteoliposomes was followed (6Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilgen G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Google Scholar, 12Kim P.F. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W.

However, tight binding of TA proteins to lipid bilayers without translocation of the C terminus can occur in artificial systems, as has been demonstrated for cytochromeb 5 (14Dailey H.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3951-3955Google Scholar, 15Arinc E. Rzepecki L.M. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15563-15567Google Scholar). The Sec61 translocon has been proposed as the most likely candidate for translocation of the C terminus of TA proteins across the ER membrane (16Tyedmers J. Lerner M. Bies C. Dude J. Skowronek M.H. Haas I.G. Heim N. Nastainczyk W. Volkmer J. Zimmermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7214-7219Google Scholar, 17Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 66-71Google Scholar, 18Nilsson I. Johnson A.E. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 106-108Google Scholar). This heterotrimeric complex, conserved in higher eukaryotes and yeast, is composed of the multispanning protein Sec61p that forms an aqueous channel and two small proteins (called Sbh1p and Sss1p in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Sec61β and Sec61γ in mammals). In conjunction with additional accessory polypeptides, the Sec61 complex is able to provide all translocation functions of signal peptide-containing proteins at the ER membrane. It serves as the channel for both co- and post-translational translocation as well as for retrotranslocation back to the cytosol of short-lived or malfolded proteins destined for proteasomal degradation (see Refs. 19Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Google Scholar and 20Römisch K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4185-4191Google Scholar). In the case of post-translational translocation, more common in yeast than mammalian cells, the Sec61 channel must interact with Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p and cooperate with the lumenal Hsp70 chaperone BiP/Kar2p (21Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Google Scholar, 22Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6024-6035Google Scholar, 23Brodsky J.L. Schekman R.A. J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Google Scholar). Mammalian orthologues of Sec62p/63p are known (16Tyedmers J. Lerner M. Bies C. Dude J. Skowronek M.H. Haas I.G. Heim N. Nastainczyk W. Volkmer J. Zimmermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7214-7219Google Scholar,26Meyer H.A. Grau H. Kraft R. Kosta S.W. Prehn S. Kalies K.U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 12: 14550-14557Google Scholar) and may also be involved in post-translational transport. A second translocon, previously thought to operate in co-translational translocation only, is present in the yeast ER membrane. It consists of the Sec61p homolog Ssh1p, the Shb1 homolog Sbh2p, and Sss1p (27Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that it is also involved in post-translational translocation as well as retrotranslocation (28Wilkinson B.M. Tyson J.R. Stirling C.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 401-409Google Scholar). Thus, this complex could also be involved in TA protein insertion. In previous studies we used a mutant version of cytochromeb 5 to study the trafficking of TA proteins in mammalian cells (4Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2482-2496Google Scholar, 11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar, 29Bulbarelli A. Sprocati T. Barberi M. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1689-1702Google Scholar). This mutant b 5, called b 5-Nglyc, is tagged at its C terminus with a sequence corresponding to the first 19 amino acids of bovine opsin. The tag provides an N-glycosylation consensus site that is used efficiently in vivo as well as in a cell-free system. Here we have taken advantage of S. cerevisiaemutants to study in vivo whether the Sec61 translocon complex is involved in translocation of the C terminus of TA proteins, using glycosylation of b 5-Nglyc as a rigorous criterion for translocation. We find that efficient translocation occurs under conditions in which Sec61p, Sec62p, Sec63p, or BiP/Kar2p as well as other proteins functioning in ER translocation, Sbh1p/2p and Lhs1p, are non-functional for signal peptide-driven translocation. In addition, translocation of b 5-Nglyc has low energy requirements both in vivo and in a mammalian cell-free system. These results indicate that post-translational translocation of the C-terminal tail of TA proteins occurs by a mechanism distinct from signal peptide-driven translocation, most likely without the participation of the Sec61 complex. The opsin-tagged cytochrome b 5cDNA containing a consensus sequence for N-glycosylation (b 5-Nglyc; Ref. 11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar) in pGEM4 was amplified by PCR with primers conferring EcoR1 and XbaI sites at its 5′- and 3′-extremities, respectively. These two sites were used to place the cDNA between the SUC2 promoter and theADH1 terminator in the Escherichia coli-yeast shuttle vector pFL26, resulting in plasmid pKTH5013, or in the high copy number episomal vector pYES2 (Invitrogen), resulting in plasmid pKTH5014.

Expression of b 5-Nglyc was induced by shifting the cells to medium containing 2% raffinose or 0.1% glucose. Both conditions resulted in a similar up-regulation ofb 5-Nglyc synthesis. Cells were mechanically lysed with glass beads in NET buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X-100, 100 μg/ml aprotinin), containing 2% SDS and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). For EndoH treatment, the lysis was performed in non-denaturing buffer (80 mm CH3COONa, pH 5.2, 2% Triton-X-100, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were boiled for 10 min and treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H, 20 milli-units) for 4 h at 37 °C. Samples, treated or not with Endo H, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% gels) followed by blotting onto Hybond-CTM extra (AmershamBiosciences) as previously described (38Paunola E. Suntio T. Jamsa E. Makarow M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 817-827Google Scholar).b 5-Nglyc was detected by ECL (AmershamBiosciences) using an anti-opsin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Dr. Paul Hargrave, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; Ref. 39Adamus G. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 34: 89-97Google Scholar) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Santa-Cruz Biotech), diluted 1:2000 and 1:10 000, respectively. Metabolic labeling of yeast cells in synthetic complete medium lacking methionine and cysteine with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine/ml (Amersham Biosciences), cell lysis, and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (38Paunola E. Suntio T. Jamsa E. Makarow M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 817-827Google Scholar). In pulse-chase experiments, cycloheximide (CHX) was added in the chase medium at 30 μg/ml. Where indicated, tunicamycin (TM) from Sigma at 10 μg/ml was added 15 min prior to labeling and included during the pulse-chase incubation.b 5-Nglyc, carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), or Hsp150Δ-β−lactamase (38Paunola E. Suntio T. Jamsa E. Makarow M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 817-827Google Scholar) were immunoprecipitated with anti-opsin mAbs (1:400), with anti-CPY, or with anti-β-lactamase antisera (both 1:100), respectively. SDS-PAGE of b 5-Nglyc and Hsp150Δ-β-lactamase samples was in 12% gels and of CPY in 8% gels. In vitrotranscription of b 5-Nglyc cDNA from the SP6 promoter, translation of the transcript in the reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), post-translational incubation of undiluted translation mix with dog pancreas microsomes (DPMs), and SDS-PAGE autoradiography analysis of the products were carried out as previously described (11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar). To test the effect of lysate proteins on post-translational glycosylation, translation mixtures were diluted either in buffer or in lysate as indicated in Fig. 7. The final concentrations of ions, dithiothreitol, nucleotides (ATP and GTP from Sigma), phosphocreatine, and creatine kinase (Sigma) in the samples diluted in buffer were kept at the levels of the initial translation mix as specified by Promega. The diluted samples were then supplemented with equal amounts of DPMs. ATP was depleted from lysates either with apyrase or with a hexokinase/glucose trap. For apyrase treatment, 7 μl of lysate containing in vitro-translatedb 5-Nglyc were incubated for 10 min at 30 ° C with 2.5 μl of a solution containing 3.75 units of apyrase (grade VI; Sigma) before addition of 0.5 μl of DPM suspension (Promega). Controls received 2.5 μl of water instead of the apyrase solution. For depletion with hexokinase (Sigma) and glucose, 4.5-μl aliquots of lysate containing in vitro-translatedb 5-Nglyc were supplemented with 0.6 μl of a solution containing 0.25 m glucose, 0.3 mg/ml CHX, and varying concentrations of hexokinase (0, 4.2, 21, or 210 μg/ml). After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the samples received 0.6 μl of DPMs and were further incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. To test the effect of the hexokinase/glucose trap on translation, 4.5-μl aliquots of lysate lacking the b 5-Nglyc transcript were treated as above with glucose and varying concentrations of hexokinase (but without CHX), then supplemented with the synthetic transcript and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. To determine the ATP concentration, 1-μl aliquots of hexokinase/glucose-treated lysates were diluted in ice-cold water and assayed by the luciferin-luciferase procedure. 20 μl of diluted lysate samples were mixed with 100 μl of a 20 mg/ml solution of combined luciferase-luciferin from Sigma. Light emission was recorded after 20 s with the use of a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). ATP concentrations were calculated by comparison with a standard curve. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of yeast cells was carried out as before (40Suntio T. Shmelev A. Lund M. Makarow M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3889-3898Google Scholar), using anti-opsin mAbs (1:100) and/or porin antiserum (1:100), a kind gift from Dr. Harald Pichler (University of Graz, Austria), and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse (1:100) and/or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:100) antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transmission electron microscopy was performed as previously described (41Simola M. Hanninen A.-L. Stranius S.-M. Makarow M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 42-53Google Scholar). A cDNA coding for a mammalian cytochrome b 5variant with an opsin tag and a consensus site forN-glycosylation close to the C terminus (designatedb 5-Nglyc; see Ref. 11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A) was placed under the glucose-regulated SUC2 promoter and integrated into the genome of a yeast strain with normal Sec61p function (H1415; see TableI for yeast strains) and of the temperature-sensitive mutant sec61–3 (H1399). In the latter cells, the channel protein Sec61p of the Sec61 translocon is defective at 37 °C. After induction of expression ofb 5-Nglyc by incubation of the cells in glucose-deficient, raffinose-containing medium for an hour at the permissive temperature (24 °C), the cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and detection of the recombinant protein with anti-opsin mAb. Parallel samples were digested with Endo H to remove N-glycans prior to gel electrophoresis. In the normal (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), as well as in the mutant (lane 3) cells, ∼25 and ∼20-kDa proteins were detected in the absence of Endo H treatment, whereas after digestion only the ∼20-kDa protein was detected (lanes 2 and 4). The parental strains lacking the recombinant gene revealed no signal (not shown). Thus, the C-terminal domain of most of the b 5-Nglyc molecules had been translocated into the ER lumen and glycosylated. ER localization was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent staining. In cells with normal Sec61p (H1415), induced to expressb 5-Nglyc, staining for the recombinant protein (Fig. 2, a and d) was visible in the perinuclear and peripheral regions, which correspond to the perinuclear and cortical ER, respectively (42Prinz W.A. Grzyb L. Veenhuis M. Kahana J.A. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 461-474Google Scholar). No staining was present in vacuoles, revealed by differential interference contrast optics (panel b). Co-staining of the sample ofpanel d with anti-porin antibodies resulted in a pattern typical for mitochondria (panel c), clearly different from that obtained with the anti-opsin mAbs, confirming that most of theb 5-Nglyc was specifically targeted to the ER as occurs in mammalian cells (4Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2482-2496Google Scholar, 11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar). The yeast ER has been shown to proliferate up to 20 pairs of stacked membranes encircling the nucleus (so-called karmellae) upon overexpression for 24 h of rat cytochromeb 5 (43Vergères G. Yen T.S. Aggeler J. Lausier J. Waskell L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 249-259Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked by electron microscopy whether the ER of our b 5-Nglyc expressing cells was normal or underwent a similar proliferation. Comparison of Fig. 3, A and B shows that after 2 h of induction, within the time window of our biochemical experiments (panel B), the cortical and perinuclear components of the ER appeared indistinguishable from those of uninduced cells (panel A). After 6 h of induction, some proliferation of the ER appeared to have started (Fig. 3 C), whereas after 22 h membrane stacks similar to those described by Vergères et al. (43Vergères G. Yen T.S. Aggeler J. Lausier J. Waskell L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 249-259Google Scholar) were clearly visible (Fig. 3 D). Next we studied whether ER translocation of newly synthesized b 5-Nglyc was blocked when the Sec61 channel was inactivated for signal peptide-driven translocation at 37 °C in the sec61–3 mutant (H1399). Sec61–3cells were preincubated for 30 min in 2% raffinose to induceb 5-Nglyc expression, either at the restrictive or at the permissive temperature, then labeled with [35S]met/cys for 5 min, and chased for 20 min. At both temperatures the major immunoprecipitated form ofb 5-Nglyc corresponded to the ∼25-kDa glycosylated form (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 3). When the incubation at the restrictive temperature was performed in the presence of TM to inhibitN-glycosylation (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), only the ∼20-kDa polypeptide could be immunoprecipitated, confirming that the band at 25 kDa corresponds to the N-glycosylated form of b 5-Nglyc. When this experiment was repeated in a sec61–41 mutant (strain H1417, Table I), which is cold-sensitive for translocation (34Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Google Scholar), similar results, showing efficient glycosylation of b 5-Nglyc, were obtained both at 17 and 24 °C (data not shown). Whenb 5-Nglyc was expressed in a sbh1strain (H1520) lacking the Sec61 translocon component Sbh1p, it again was glycosylated, as well as in a sbh1 sbh2 double deletant that also lacked Sbh2p, a component of the alternate Ssh1 translocon complex (data not shown). The Sec63 complex (Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p plus Sec72p) and the lumenal chaperones Kar2p/BiP and Lhs1p are required for signal peptide-driven post-translational ER translocation (19Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Google Scholar, 25Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Google Scholar, 44Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Feldheim D.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 349: 806-808Google Scholar, 45Tyson J. Stirling C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6440-6452Google Scholar). Therefore, we integrated our b 5-Nglyc cDNA under theSUC2 promoter into the genome of yeast strains harboring temperature-sensitive mutations in the SEC63, SEC62,or KAR2 genes and of a strain lacking the LHS1gene (37Saris N. Holkeri H. Crave R.A. Stirling C. Makarow M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 813-824Google Scholar). A pulse-chase experiment carried out with a temperature-sensitive sec63–1 mutant showed thatb 5-Nglyc was again translocated equally efficiently at the restrictive and permissive temperatures (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–6). Similar results were obtained for the temperature-sensitive kar2–159 (H1424) andlhs1 (H1425) mutants (data not shown). Inactivation of the Sec61 channel is lethal, whereas inactivation of proteins required for signal peptide-driven post-translational translocation only, such as Sec63p or Sec62p, can be tolerated (32Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Google Scholar). The results on the sec63-1 mutant of Fig. 4 A were confirmed by using constitutive sec63–201 (H1475) andsec62–101 (H1474) mutants. Again, the mutations did not prevent translocation of the C terminus ofb 5-Nglyc (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–4). To study whether the observed glycosylation of b 5-Nglyc in the translocation-deficient mutants could be explained by leakage of the mutants, we compared the fate of b 5-Nglyc to that of an internal control, the vacuolar protease CPY, a protein that is post-translationally translocated in a Sec61/62/63-dependent manner (32Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Google Scholar) As demonstrated before (46Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Google Scholar) and shown here for reference, in normal cells CPY is rapidly translocated into the ER, appearing after a 5 min pulse of radioactive amino acids mainly as a primary N-glycosylated 67-kDa form with a minute portion present as the cytosolic, unglycosylated, 59-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 5 A,lane 7). Thereafter, the glycosylated form is transported via the Golgi, where the glycan extension causes the apparent molecular mass to increase to 69 kDa (lane 8), to the vacuole where removal of the pro-peptide results in the mature 61-kDa form (lane 9). In the constitutive sec62–101and sec63–201mutants, it has previously been demonstrated that CPY accumulates in the cytosolic form (32Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Google Scholar). Here, we have compared the fates ofb 5-Nglyc and CPY in the conditional translocation-defective mutants, sec61–3 andsec63–1. After preincubation and pulse-labeling for 5 min at the restrictive temperature, one half of each lysate was exposed to anti-opsin mAbs to immunoprecipitate b 5-Nglyc (Fig. 5 A), while CPY was immunoprecipitated from the other half (Fig. 5 B).

The Src inhibitor, PP2, the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), and dominant–negative Pyk2 attenuated ERK1/2 activation by GnRH and PMA but not by EGF.

The pulsatile delivery of GnRH to the anterior pituitary gland is essential to maintain the circulating gonadotropin profiles that are necessary for normal reproductive function. In addition to regulating pituitary gonadotropin release, GnRH has extrapituitary actions in neural and nonneural tissues and in several types of tumor cells (1Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 739-757Google Scholar). Immortalized GnRH-producing neurons (GT1–7 neurons) express several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including those for GnRH and luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (2Mores N. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5731-5734Google Scholar, 3Krsmanovic L.Z. Stojilkovic S.S. Mertz L.M. Tomic M. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1397-1402Google Scholar), muscarinic (5Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. Navarro C.E. Saeed S.A. Arora K.K. Catt K.J.

These cells retain many of the characteristics of the native GnRH neurons, including the ability to maintain pulsatile GnRH release (1Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 739-757Google Scholar,3Krsmanovic L.Z. Stojilkovic S.S. Mertz L.M. Tomic M. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3908-3912Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the autocrine action of GnRH on hypothalamic GnRH neurons is involved in the mechanism of pulsatile GnRH secretion (3Krsmanovic L.Z. Stojilkovic S.S. Mertz L.M. Tomic M. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3908-3912Google Scholar). Agonist activation of specific GPCRs and the resulting dissociation of their cognate G proteins releases α- and βγ-subunits that regulate phospholipase C-β, adenylyl cyclase, and ion channels, which in turn control the intracellular levels of inositol phosphates, Ca2+, cAMP, and other second messengers (7Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Google Scholar, 8Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Google Scholar). The major signal transduction pathways in cells expressing GnRH receptors are initiated by activation of phospholipase C. The consequent calcium (Ca2+) mobilization and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by GnRH are key elements in the hypothalamic control of gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland (1Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 739-757Google Scholar, 3Krsmanovic L.Z. Stojilkovic S.S. Mertz L.M. Tomic M. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of PKC and Ca2+ mobilization during GnRH receptor stimulation are also responsible for mediating downstream signals leading to activation of extracellularly regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2 MAPKs) that transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus to regulate transcriptional and other processes (7Marinissen M.J.

Mitogenic signaling by GPCRs can also occur through activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family, focal adhesion kinases (FAKs), and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The RTKs involved in GPCR-mediated activation of ERK1/2 MAPKs include the EGF-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and insulin-like growth factor receptor (14Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y.

GPCR-mediated transactivation of the EGF-R initiates the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade through recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as the Shc-Grb2-Sos complex, that activate the small G protein, Ras (14Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Google Scholar, 22Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Google Scholar). Depending on the GPCR agonist and cell type, Ca2+, PKC, G protein βγ subunits, and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases including Src and Pyk2, have been implicated in GPCR-induced EGF-R transactivation (14Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Google Scholar, 22Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Google Scholar). Endogenous EGF-Rs are expressed in several model systems, including αT3–1 gonadotrophs, COS-7 cells, and HEK-293 cells, that have been used in studies on GnRH signaling. However, the role of EGF-R transactivation in GnRH-induced ERK activation has been a subject of controversy and is not clearly defined (9Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4554-4563Google Scholar, 10Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Hohn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Google Scholar, 23Hislop J.N. Everest H.M. Flynn A. Harding T.

Also, the signaling molecules involved in cross-talk between the neuronal GnRH-R and the EGF-R have not been identified. Depending upon the cell type, GPCRs mediate both Ras-independent ERK1/2 activation via stimulation of PKC and Ras-dependent ERK activation by receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (7Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Google Scholar, 14Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Google Scholar). GnRH has been found to activate ERK1/2 MAPKs in αT3–1 gonadotrophs and in COS-7 cells (8Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Google Scholar, 9Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12619-12625Google Scholar), is mediated through the proline-rich protein tyrosine kinase, Pyk2. In general, Pyk2 activation in conjunction with Src kinase appears to be a key element in GPCR-mediated transactivation of the EGF-R (31Andreev J. Galisteo M.L. Kranenburg O. Logan S.K. Chiu E.S. Okigaki M. Cary L.A. Moolenaar W.M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20130-20135Google Scholar). However, no information is available on the role of Pyk2 and the nature of its interaction with Src and EGF-R during receptor stimulation by GnRH. The present studies have identified a signaling cascade that mediates GnRH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in immortalized GnRH neurons (GT1–7 cells) and is dependent on receptor-mediated activation of PKC, Src, Pyk2, and the EGF-R. GnRH was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA), EGF was from Invitrogen, and pertussis toxin was from List Biological Laboratories. Protein assay kits were from Pierce. ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies were from New England Biolabs, and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from KPL. Antibodies against Src, EGF-R, phospho-EGF-R (Tyr1173), and phosphotyrosine (PY20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Pyk2 (Tyr402) was from either Calbiochem orBIOSOURCE International, and anti-phospho-EGF-R (Tyr1068) was from BIOSOURCEInternational. Mouse monoclonal hemagglutinin tag antibody was from Covance Babco (Berkeley, CA). AG1478, Go6983, Ro318220, PP2, BAPTA, PMA, and wortmannin were from Calbiochem, and antibodies against PKC isoforms and Pyk2 were from Transduction Laboratories. LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. The Pyk2, dominant negative Pyk2, constitutively active Src, and Csk constructs were provided by Dr. Zvi Naor (University of Tel Aviv). PKC isoform-specific dominant negative and constitutively active constructs tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope were prepared as previously described (32Soh J-W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Google Scholar). Western blotting reagents and ECL were obtained from Amersham Biosciences or Pierce. GT1–7 neurons donated by Dr. Richard Weiner (University of California, San Francisco) were grown in culture medium consisting of 500 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.584 g/liter l-glutamate and 4.5 g/liter glucose, mixed with 500 ml of F-12 medium containing 0.146 g/liter l-glutamate, 1.8 g/liter glucose, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 2.5 g/liter sodium carbonate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. DNA transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were labeled for 24 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]inositol as previously described (5Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. Navarro C.E. Saeed S.A. Arora K.K. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4037-4043Google Scholar) and then washed twice with inositol-free M199 medium and stimulated at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. The reactions were stopped with perchloric acid, inositol phosphates were extracted, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation γ-spectrometry. Serum-starved GT1–7 cells were treated with either PMA or GnRH for the times indicated and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected in homogenization buffer containing 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. After they were kept on ice for 10 min, cells were homogenized with 25 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The high speed supernatant constituted the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed three times and extracted in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The Triton-soluble component (membrane fraction) was separated from the insoluble material (cytoskeletal fraction) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. After treatment with inhibitors and drugs, cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm NaF, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstain, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonyl fluoride), and probe-sonicated (Sonifier cell disruptor). Solubilized lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min, precleared with agarose, and then incubated with specific antibodies and protein A- or G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were collected, washed four times with lysis buffer, and dissolved in Laemmli buffer. After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the samples were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% gradient gels. Cells grown in six-well plates and at 60–70% confluence were serum-starved for 24 h before treatment at 37 °C with selected agents. The media were then aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were briefly sonicated, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (8–16%) gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies and washed three times with TBST before probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (AmershamBiosciences or Pierce) and quantitated with a laser-scanning densitometer. In some cases, blots were stripped and reprobed with other antibodies. GnRH treatment of GT1–7 cells caused transient stimulation of ERK1/2 that reached a peak at 5 min and declined thereafter toward the basal level over 30 min (Fig. 1 A). GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation was concentration-dependent over the 0.2–200 nm range and was abolished by the GnRH receptor antagonist, [d-pGlu1,d-Phe,d-Trp(3,6)]GnRH (Fig. 1, B and C). GnRH receptors are primarily coupled to Gq/11 proteins, but some of the physiological actions of GnRH are known to occur through activation of Gsor Gi proteins (5Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. Navarro C.E. Saeed S.A. Arora K.K. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4037-4043Google Scholar, 33Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Google Scholar). In GT1–7 neurons, nanomolar GnRH concentrations cause marked elevation of inositol phosphate production through Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase C and also stimulate cAMP production. Higher concentrations of GnRH (0.1–1 μm) reduce intracellular cAMP levels in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, suggesting that GnRH activates a Giprotein in GT1–7 cells (34Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. Navarro C.E. Tomic M. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 429-440Google Scholar). Consistent with this, pertussis toxin had a modest inhibitory effect (∼30%) on GnRH-induced ERK activation, suggesting partial involvement of Gi protein(s) in MAPK signaling in GT1–7 cells (Fig. 1 D). The roles of PKC and Ca2+ in agonist-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 were evaluated in studies with PKC inhibitors and the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA-2AM and EGTA. GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation was found to be highly PKC-dependent and was abolished by the PKC inhibitors Ro318220 and Go6983 (Fig. 2 A). These inhibitors had no effect on ERK1/2 activation induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Fig. 2 B) or isoproterenol, a β2-adrenoreceptor agonist (data not shown). Consistent with its critical role in GnRH action, depletion of PKC by prolonged PMA treatment (1 μm for 16 h) abolished agonist-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2 C). However, ERK1/2 activation by GnRH was less sensitive to Ca2+ chelation by EGTA and BAPTA (Fig. 2 D). Consistent with this, the PKC activator, PMA, was much more effective than the Ca2+ionophore, ionomycin, in eliciting ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2 E). These findings suggest that GnRH receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation in GT1–7 cells is predominantly dependent on PKC. A major role of PKC in GnRH-induced ERK activation has also been reported in other cell types (8Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Google Scholar, 9Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4554-4563Google Scholar, 10Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Hohn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Google Scholar), but little information is available about the involvement of specific PKC isoforms in this cascade. GT1–7 cells were found to contain several immunoreactive PKC isoforms, including α, δ, ε, and λ. Overnight PMA stimulation (2 μm) caused down-regulation of PKCα, -δ, and -ε but not PKCλ (Fig. 3 A). Among the PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms, only PKCα and -ε were translocated from cytosol to the cell membrane during treatment with GnRH and PMA (Fig. 3 B). These effects of GnRH and PMA were specific, since no changes in the levels of ERK1/2 and Na+/K+-ATPase were found in cytosol and membranes, respectively (Fig. 3 C). The predominant role of PKCα in GnRH-induced ERK activation was confirmed in studies with constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of PKCα. These results showed that GnRH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated by dominant negative PKCα (dnPKCα; Fig. 4) and was increased with transfection of constitutively active PKCα (data not shown).Figure 4The effects of dominant negative PKC α on ERK1/2 activation by GnRH.A, expression of native and transfected dominant negative PKCα (dnPKCα) in GT1–7 cells transfected with plasmid DNA (2 and 5 μg) encoding dominant negative PKCα. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer before loading onto 8–16% gradient gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. The expression of PKC constructs was detected using antibody against the hemagglutinin epitope with which these mutant proteins are tagged. Whereas conventional antibody against PKCα detects both native and exogenous dominant negative PKC proteins, the hemagglutinin antibody detects only the product of transfected dominant negative PKC with no immunoreactivity in the nontransfected (NT) cells.B, effects of overexpression of dominant negative PKCα on GnRH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (ERK1/2-P). Serum-starved cells were stimulated with GnRH (200 nm for 5 min) and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer before loading onto 8–16% gradient gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. The quantitated data are shown in the lower panel(n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is well established that transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF-R contributes to GPCR-mediated ERK1/2 activation in certain cell types (14Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Google Scholar, 22Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Google Scholar). However, studies on the role of the EGF-R in GnRH action have not given consistent results (9Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4554-4563Google Scholar, 10Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Hohn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Google Scholar). Thus, whereas Grosse et al. (10Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Hohn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Google Scholar) implicated transactivation of the EGF-R in GnRH-induced stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in αT3–1 pituitary gonadotrophs, Benard et al. (9Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4554-4563Google Scholar) subsequently reported that the major pathway of ERK1/2 activation was through PKC and activation of Raf-1 and did not involve the EGF-R. Since GT1–7 cells express receptors for both EGF and GnRH, we evaluated the role of the EGF-R in GnRH-induced MAPK signaling. In this cell type, EGF, like GnRH, caused transient activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5 A). As expected, the selective EGF-R kinase inhibitor, AG1478, blocked the ERK1/2 activation induced by EGF (Fig. 5 B). EGF stimulation caused rapid and marked phosphorylation of the EGF-R at Tyr1173 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5, C andD). Our data suggest a potential role of PKC in GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation. To determine whether PKC acts upstream or downstream of the EGF-R, we examined the effect of PKC inhibition on EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation. Whereas PKC depletion by prolonged PMA treatment or PKC inhibitors abolished the effects of PMA and GnRH, it had no effect on EGF responses (Fig. 5, E and F). These data indicate that EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation is PKC-independent and that PKC acts upstream of the EGF-R during GnRH signaling in GT1–7 cells. To examine the involvement of EGF-R in GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation in GT1–7 cells, cells were pretreated with AG1478 and stimulated with GnRH (200 nm for 5 min). As shown in Fig. 6 A, GnRH-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was also abolished by AG1478, indicating its absolute dependence on transactivation of the EGF-R. The inhibitory action of AG1478 on GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation was selective and did not affect bFGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with the role of EGF-R in GnRH signaling, GnRH also stimulated phosphorylation of the EGF-R as measured with anti-phosphopeptide antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated molecule at Tyr1173 or Tyr1168 (Fig. 6 C), the major sites of Src kinase phosphorylation (35Wright J.D. Reuter C.W. Weber M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 85-93Google Scholar) and Grb2 binding (36Zwick E. Wallasch C. Daub H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20989-20996Google Scholar), respectively. These data demonstrate that transactivation and phosphorylation of the EGF-R are essential for GnRH signaling through ERK1/2 in GT1–7 cells. Since GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation is primarily dependent on PKC and GnRH causes PKC activation through generation of diacylglycerol (8Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Google Scholar, 9Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4554-4563Google Scholar, 10Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Hohn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of PMA on this cascade. The results revealed that PMA caused marked ERK1/2 activation that was abolished by prior PKC depletion (as shown above in Fig. 5 D) and by PKC inhibitors, Ro318220 and Go6983 (Fig. 7, A and B). To determine whether PMA mimics the effects of GnRH with respect to EGF-R transactivation, GT1–7 cells were treated with AG1478 and stimulated with PMA. As shown in Fig. 7 C, PMA-induced ERK1/2 activation was extinguished in a dose-dependent manner by the EGF-R kinase inhibitor, AG1478, indicating that GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation occurs through EGF-R transactivation in a PKC-dependent manner. Since there is no consensus on the types of intermediate proteins involved during GPCR-induced transactivation of the EGF-R (14Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Google Scholar,36Zwick E. Wallasch C. Daub H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20989-20996Google Scholar, 37Shah B.H. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 343-351Google Scholar), we examined the roles of Src and Pyk2 in GnRH-induced EGF-R phosphorylation and ERK activation. In GT1–7 cells, the highly selective Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, and the Src negative regulatory kinase, Csk, attenuated the activation of ERK1/2 by GnRH (Fig. 8, A and B). Similarly, Src inhibition abolished the effect of PMA on ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 8 C). In contrast, Src inhibition and Csk had no effect on EGF-induced ERK1/2 responses (Fig. 8 D). These data suggest that Src has a critical role in GnRH-induced activation of the EGF-R and ERK1/2. Since our data show that both PKC and Src act upstream of EGF-R, we examined the interaction between PKC and Src. As shown in Fig. 8 E, GnRH stimulation increased the association of PKCα and -ε with Src. A role for the nonreceptor proline-rich tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, in ERK1/2 activation by some GPCRs has been shown (26Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Owasa K.M.

Its synaptic action, like that of most other neurotransmitters, is terminated by sodium-coupled transport. Many neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters (for a review, see Refs. 1Kanner B.I. J. Exp.

These transporters form a large family and include transporters for biogenic amines and amino acids. Besides GAT-1, the first member of the family to be identified, it contains three other GABA transporters. One of the best examples of the importance of these neurotransmitter transporters comes from studies of dopamine transporter knockout mice; the decay of extracellular dopamine in brain slices of such mice is ∼100 times longer than normal (3Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar).

It should be noted, however, that there still is some dispute regarding this issue. In a recent report, it has been proposed that, during sodium-coupled GABA transport, obligatory Clout/Clin exchange takes place (10Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. Boorer K.J. Sarkar H.K. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

GAT-1, as well as the other members of the family, is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains linked by hydrophilic loops with the amino and carboxyl termini residing inside the cell (5Guastella J.

Electrophysiological measurements of GAT-1 have demonstrated sodium-dependent GABA-induced inwardly rectifying currents reflecting the electrogenic sodium- and chloride-coupled translocation of GABA (7Kavanaugh M.P.

Moreover, in the absence of GABA, but in the presence of sodium, GAT-1 exhibits capacitative transient currents (8Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

These transients are thought to reflect a charge-moving conformational change that takes place after the binding of sodium and that enables subsequent GABA binding (8Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M.

Remarkably, in the presence of lithium, inwardly rectifying steady-state currents are observed in the absence of GABA (13Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A.

Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the latter case, it has been suggested that this leak pathway may protect cells from metal ion overload (24Chen X.-Z. Peng J.-B. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the relationship of these leak currents to coupled transport is poorly understood. In the case of the uncoupled currents observed with the glutamate transporters, it has been shown that the conformation of the transporter mediating this process is distinct from the coupled process (25Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Seal R.P. Shigeri Y. Eliasof S. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recently, co-workers and I have obtained some evidence that the same may be true for the leak currents mediated by GAT-1 (29MacAulay N. Bendahan A. Loland C.J. Zeuthen T. Kanner B.I. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40476-40485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, I show that the leak mode of GAT-1 represents a unique conformation of the transporter. Mutants at a water-accessible position in the middle of the highly conserved transmembrane domain I that appear to be locked in the leak mode are described. Moreover, other determinants located in this transmembrane domain that control the sodium-dependent transition of the leak to transport mode have been identified here. Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type GAT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene) according to the method of Kunkel et al.(30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zarkour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) as described (31Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the parent DNA was used to transformEscherichia coli CJ236 (dut−,ung−). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand; and consequently, mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Restriction sites ClaI and AvrII were used to subclone the mutations into the construct containing wild-type GAT-1 in pOG1 (14Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The latter is an oocyte expression vector that contains a 5′-untranslated Xenopusβ-globin sequence and a 3′-poly(A) signal. The coding and noncoding strands were sequenced between the above two restriction sites. Capped runoff cRNA transcripts were made from transporter constructs in pOG1 linearized withSacII using mMessage mMachine (Ambion Inc.). Oocytes were removed from anesthetized Xenopus laevis frogs and treated with collagenase (type 1A, Sigma C-9891) until capillaries were absent and injected with 50 nl of undiluted cRNA the same or the next day. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mmCa(NO3)2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with freshly added 2 mm sodium pyruvic acid and 0.5 mm theophylline and supplemented with 10,000 units/liter penicillin, 10 mg/liter streptomycin, and 50 mg/liter gentamycin. Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber; penetrated with two micropipettes (back-filled with 2 m KCl, with resistance varied between 0.5 and 2 megaohms); and voltage-clamped using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and digitized using Digidata 1200A (Axon Instruments, Inc.), both controlled with the pClamp6 suite (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Currents were acquired with clampex6.03 and low pass-filtered at 10 kHz every 0.5 ms. Oocytes were stepped from −160 to +40 mV in 25-mV increments, using −25 mV as the holding potential unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. Each potential was clamped for 500 ms. The membrane potential was measured relative to an extracellular Ag/AgCl electrode in the recording chamber. The recording solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In substitution experiments, sodium ions were replaced with equimolar choline or lithium. The records shown in Figs. 2, 3, 6, and 7 are typical and representative of results from four to eight oocytes. In the other figures, the currents were normalized as indicated in the legends to plot results of 3–13 oocytes as means ± S.E.

For each determination, five oocytes expressing either the wild type or the indicated mutant were used. One-eighth of the sample was retained as the source of total protein, and the remainder was treated with streptavidin beads to recover the biotinylated proteins. The GAT-1 protein was detected with an affinity-purified antibody to an epitope located in the carboxyl terminus of GAT-1 (residues 571–586), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and ECL as described (33Bennett E.R., Su, H.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), were done as published previously. Of the members of the sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family, the biogenic amine transporters possess a conserved aspartate residue in the middle of transmembrane domain I. All other members of the transporter family, including GAT-1, have a glycine at the corresponding position (Gly63 in GAT-1). In the study of the structure/function relationships in transmembrane domain I of GAT-1, I mutated Gly63 to aspartate as well as to serine, cysteine, and alanine. This led to the complete loss of sodium- and chloride-dependent [3H]GABA uptake, as observed upon expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 1). A similar loss of function was observed with the sodium-dependent GABA-induced transport currents in X. laevis oocytes as shown here for the G63C and G63S mutants (Fig. 2, A,C, and E). Remarkably, however, the two mutants exhibited robust GABA-independent inwardly rectifying leak currents in lithium medium (Fig. 2, D and F). The currents of both of these mutants were similar in magnitude and voltage dependence to that mediated by wild-type GAT-1 (Fig. 2 B) and were not influenced by GABA (data not shown). The kinetics (but not the steady-state level) of the currents observed in lithium were dependent on the nature of the substitution at position 63. In the G63S (but not G63C) mutant, the onset of these currents was markedly slowed down (Fig. 2, B, D, and F). Results similar to those obtained with G63C were obtained when Gly63 was replaced by alanine, but no lithium leak currents were observed when aspartate was substituted for Gly63 (data not shown). Even though position 63 is located in the middle of transmembrane domain I, it is possible that this conserved domain lines an aqueous pathway through the transporter, and a cysteine residue introduced at this position is accessible to hydrophilic membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents. Consistent with this idea, the lithium-dependent currents of G63C (but not of G63S) were almost completely abolished by positively charged MTSET as well as by negatively charged (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (Fig. 3) (data not shown). A conserved cysteine (Cys74 in GAT-1) located in the first extracellular loop is the only endogenous cysteine that is externally accessible in GAT-1 and most members of this family (36Wang J.B. Moriaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 38Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the sensitivity of the lithium-dependent currents observed with G63C is due to an increased accessibility of Cys74, the G63C and G63S mutants were subcloned into a construct in which Cys74 was replaced by alanine (C74A). The currents of this latter mutant were very similar to those mediated by the wild type (data not shown). The lithium-dependent currents of the G63C/C74A mutant (Fig. 3 A) were almost completely abolished by pretreatment with MTSET (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, no effect of MTSET on the lithium-dependent currents of the G63S/C74A mutant was observed (Fig. 3, C and D). Similarly, 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate also inhibited these currents of G63C/C74A, but not of G63S/C74A (data not shown). It is of interest to note that the difference in the kinetics of the onset of the currents observed with G63C and G63S (Fig. 2, D andF) was also observed in the mutants constructed in the C74A background (Fig. 3, A and C). The absence of [3H]GABA transport and GABA-induced currents in the G63S and G63C mutants indicated that they were confined to the leak current mode. Further evidence that the leak currents represent a distinct mode of the transporter is presented in Fig. 4. The effect of sodium on the lithium currents of the wild type was measured at varying lithium levels. The lithium-dependent current did not saturate with increasing lithium concentrations, at least not up to 90 mm(Fig. 4). Sodium at a concentration as low as 1 mminhibited the current at all lithium concentrations tested. However, the inhibition by sodium was larger at higher lithium concentrations (Fig. 4). Thus, these effects are not due to a competition between lithium and sodium, but rather sodium appears to act at a distinct site to suppress the leak mode. As sodium is required for coupled transport, an important question is whether the sodium-induced conformational changes of the transport cycle are related to the suppression of the leakage mode. To address this, mutants with decreased and increased apparent sodium affinities were analyzed. Tyr60 of GAT-1, also located in transmembrane domain I, is unique among the GABA transporters. In the three other GABA transporters (GAT-2–4), a glutamate residue occupies the equivalent position of Tyr60. Interestingly, when the Y60E mutant was expressed in HeLa cells, no sodium- and chloride-dependent [3H]GABA uptake could be detected, and the same was true for the threonine substitution mutant, but the Y60C mutant exhibited significant activity (Fig. 1). Upon expression of Y60E in X. laevis oocytes, no sodium-dependent GABA-induced transport currents could be detected, and the same was true for the lithium leak currents (data not shown). In contrast to Y60E, the Y60T mutant exhibited robust lithium leak currents, ranging from −1195 to −2791 nA (n = 6) at −160 mV (Fig. 5 A). The same was true for oocytes expressing Y60C; but in contrast to G63C, these currents mediated by Y60C could not be blocked by MTSET (data not shown). The size of the lithium-dependent currents of Y60T was even larger than those of wild-type GAT-1 (Fig. 5 B): −485 to −2081 nA (n = 13). Sodium- and chloride-dependent [3H]GABA uptake was typically measured at very low GABA concentrations. However, at a saturating concentration of 1 mm, Y60T exhibited significant GABA transport currents (Fig. 5 A), ranging from −31.6 to −90.8 nA at −160 mV (n = 6). In the corresponding oocytes expressing the wild type, the GABA transport currents ranged from −342 to −1544 nA (n = 13). The voltage dependence of the currents of the mutant and wild type was similar (Fig. 5, A and B), but it is obvious that the ratio of the lithium leak current to the GABA current differed dramatically between Y60T and the wild type. Even though the GABA transport currents of the mutant were of small magnitude, their size was large enough to determine the sodium dependence of this process (Fig. 5 C). More than 5-fold higher sodium concentrations were needed to half-maximally activate the GABA currents of Y60T compared with those of the wild type (Fig. 5 C). It was not possible to determine the exact shift of the apparent sodium affinity in the mutant because, even at 96 mm sodium, the GABA-induced current was not yet saturated (Fig. 5 C). In parallel with the decreased apparent affinity of Y60T for sodium, 28.8 mm sodium inhibited the lithium leak current by 26 ± 2% (n = 4). In contrast, the IC50 for sodium in the same batch of oocytes expressing the wild type was 1.1 ± 0.1 mm (n = 3) (Fig. 5 D). Arg69, also located in transmembrane domain I of GAT-1, is fully conserved in the entire family of sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters. Mutation of this residue, even to a conserved one such as lysine (R69K), leads to defective [3H]GABA uptake (12Pantanowitz S. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3222-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, no steady-state GABA currents were observed in this mutant even though transients were present (Fig. 6 A). Even at 5 mmGABA, no currents could be observed, but the transients were somewhat larger (data not shown). Furthermore, the mutant exhibited significant lithium-dependent steady-state currents (Fig. 6 B). The observation that transient currents could be isolated by GABA (Fig. 6 A) indicated that, even though GABA was not transported, it could still bind to the R69K mutant. This was further substantiated by the fact that, in sodium medium, the non-transportable GABA analog SKF100330A could isolate the sodium-dependent transient currents mediated by R69K (Fig. 7 A). In contrast to the corresponding currents mediated by the wild type (Fig. 7 B), R69K exhibited transients in the “on” phase only when jumping from a holding potential of −25 mV to more positive potentials of up to +50 mV, and the opposite was true in the “off” phase (Fig. 7 A). The sodium-dependent transients were observed only when Arg69 was changed to lysine, but not when the substitution was with glutamine or cysteine (data not shown). The transients observed with R69K were capacitative; the transient currents were of the same magnitude as those obtained when jumping back to the holding potential (data not shown), and they increased when the potential was jumped to values more positive than +50 mV (data not shown). An attractive explanation is that, at a holding potential of −25 mV, all the transporters are already in the sodium-bound state, and the sodium is released by jumps to positive potentials, thereby giving rise to the outward transient current seen in Fig. 7 A. Indeed, when the external sodium concentration was progressively decreased, an inward transient became apparent (data not shown). In parallel with the increased apparent affinity of R69K for sodium, this cation inhibited the lithium-dependent currents of R69K at lower concentrations (IC50 = 0.3 ± 0.1 mm, n = 4) compared with the wild type expressed in the same batch of oocytes (IC50 = 1.0 ± 0.1 mm, n = 3) (Fig. 8). It has been found that GAT-1 also mediates leak currents in cesium, even though they are much smaller than those in the presence of lithium (13Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5404-5414Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, GAT-1 also mediated potassium leak currents, which, at −160 mV, were 62.8 ± 3.8% (n = 6) of those observed in lithium (Fig. 9 A). Such currents were not observed in non-injected oocytes (data not shown). The potassium currents had a similar voltage dependence compared with the currents observed in lithium (data not shown); and as with the lithium currents, they were also inhibited by sodium ions (Fig. 9 B). The potassium currents mediated by R69K were more sensitive to sodium than those mediated by the wild type (Fig. 9 B). In Y60T, the sensitivity of the potassium currents to sodium was markedly reduced (Fig. 9 B), as in the case of the lithium currents (Fig. 5 D). Importantly, the ratio of the potassium to lithium currents was different in wild type, R69K, and Y60T (Fig. 9 A). The same was also true for the G63S and G63C mutants, in which this ratio was 0.95 ± 0.10 and 0.93 ± 0.11, respectively (n = 3). As for the lithium currents, the potassium currents mediated by G63C/C74A (but not by G63S/C74A) were inhibited by treatment with MTSET (data not shown). The transients mediated by R69K were smaller than those mediated by the wild type (Fig. 7). To investigate the possibility that this may be due to decreased cell-surface expression, oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant transporters were treated with the impermeant biotinylation reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. Upon solubilization of the membrane proteins with detergent, the biotinylated proteins were isolated using streptavidin beads. After SDS-PAGE of total (unfractionated) and biotinylated proteins, followed by Western blot analysis using affinity-purified antibody against GAT-1, the transporter bands were visualized by ECL. In the case of the wild type, major bands of ∼50 and ∼55–60 kDa in the total and biotinylated samples were observed, respectively (Fig. 10). The latter apparently represents the fully processed form of the GAT-1 monomer (33Bennett E.R., Su, H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mobility of the upper band in the biotinylated sample of the wild type was compatible with that of a dimeric aggregate of the transporter. The expression of R69K in the total sample was similar to that of the wild type. On the other hand, much lower levels of the mutant transporter were detected in the biotinylated sample; and besides a small amount of the ∼55–60-kDa band, bands of lower mobility were detected (Fig. 10). The expression level and pattern of the biotinylated G63C mutant were similar to those of R69K (Fig. 10). Here, two sets of oocytes expressing G63C were processed in parallel to get an impression of the experimental variability. In contrast to R69K and G63C, the expression level and pattern of the Y60T mutant were very similar to those of the wild type (Fig. 10). Mutation of Gly63, located in the conserved transmembrane domain I of GAT-1, to serine or cysteine resulted in defective GABA transport and transport currents (Figs. 1 and 2). The G63S and G63C mutants did not even exhibit sodium-dependent transient currents (data not shown), but exhibited lithium leak currents, which were at least as large as those exhibited by the wild type (Fig. 2). Therefore, these mutants appear to be locked in a conformation that mediates the leak current of GAT-1. The model depicted in Fig. 11 describes how the leak mode of GAT-1 may relate to its transport cycle. For reasons of simplicity, the role of chloride is not indicated. In step 1, sodium binds to the outward-facing form of the transporter (o T). This enables subsequent GABA binding (step 2), followed by the translocation step (step 3). Release of sodium and GABA to the inside (step 4) yields the inward-facing form of the unloaded transporter (i T); and upon reorientation to the outside (step 5), a new transport cycle can commence. The leak mode of the transporter (][ T) can be generated from the unloaded outward- and/or inward-facing form of the transporter upon hyperpolarization (Fig. 5). Sodium inhibited the lithium currents mediated by the GAT-1 transporter (Fig. 4), and this is in accordance with a study that was published during the preparation of this manuscript (39MacAulay N. Zeuthen T. Gether U. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 447-458Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, sodium also inhibited the potassium leak currents mediated by GAT-1 (Fig. 9). The inhibition of the leak currents by sodium was noncompetitive (Fig. 4). This indicates that sodium binds at a distinct site from the permeating ions, bringing it into a different conformation. Because sodium induces the initial steps of the transport cycle (Fig. 11), a simple explanation is that these critical steps represent the conformational change resulting in the inhibition of the leak currents. Supporting this explanation are observations on mutants at two other positions, also located in transmembrane domain I. A decreased (Fig. 5 C) or an increased (Fig. 7 A) apparent affinity for sodium was paralleled by the ability of sodium to inhibit the leak currents (Figs.5 D, 8, and 9). The model depicted in Fig. 11 is also in harmony with the observations that the GABA currents began to saturate at negative potentials, whereas this was not the case for the lithium leak currents (Fig. 5 B). The GABA currents reflect electrogenic sodium-coupled GABA translocation involving steps 1–5. Therefore, increasingly negative potentials stimulate the translocation of positive charges that accompany GABA transport. However, at very negative potentials, a voltage-independent step apparently becomes rate-limiting for transport. It has been suggested that this is a voltage-independent interaction between GABA and the transporter (8Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The leak currents reflect only the voltage-dependent gating of the unloaded transporter. They do not require steps 1–4, one or perhaps more of which involve voltage-independent interactions. In choline medium, no inwardly rectifying leak currents were observed. Moreover, the lithium currents did not saturate with increasing concentrations of this cation (Fig. 4). Thus, it appears that only small cations (but not the larger choline) pass through the permeation pathway when this is activated by hyperpolarization. The role of Gly63 in GABA transport is as yet unclear. In the related serotonin transporter SERT, an aspartate residue occupies the position equivalent to Gly63 of GAT-1. This aspartate residue, which is conserved in all biogenic amine transporters of this family, has been implicated in the binding of the amine group of the substrate and also influences the apparent affinity of SERT for the two cosubstrates, sodium and chloride (16Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that, in the amino acid transporter members of the family, the carboxyl group of the transported amino acid fulfills a role played by the carboxyl group of the conserved aspartate in the biogenic amine transporters. If, indeed, Gly63 is part of the binding pocket for the carboxyl group of GABA, it is easy to see that even small changes at this position impair GABA transport. As sodium-dependent transients are also defective in the G63S and G63C mutants, the leak currents mediated by these mutants are their only functional property. The presence of these leak currents indicates that the conformation of the outward- and/or inward-facing unloaded transporter is not affected by the mutations at position 63. Thus, even though the leak currents do not have an obvious physiological function, they can be an important tool for structure/function studies in GAT-1. The lithium leak currents and the transient currents mediated by R69K are usually smaller than those mediated by the wild type (Figs. 6 and 7). This indicates a lower cell-surface expression of this mutant, and this is, in fact, supported by surface biotinylation experiments (Fig. 10). It is not clear why bands of lower mobility are observed in the biotinylated samples of R69K (and also of G63C) than in those of the wild type. One possibility is that, due to the lower expression levels at the cell surface, during the processing of the samples, these mutant transporters are more prone to proteolysis and subsequent aggregation. Whatever the reason, the important point for this study is that the expression level is high enough to test the hypothesis that an increased apparent affinity of sodium binding to the transporter can be correlated with an increased potency of sodium to inhibit the leak currents (Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9). In R69K, GABA has lost the ability to induce a transport current (Fig. 6 A) as well as to catalyze [3H]GABA uptake (12Pantanowitz S. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3222-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, GABA can bind inefficiently to the R69K transporters, as judged by its ability to partially isolate the transient currents at high concentrations (Fig. 6 A). A possible role of Arg69 could be to interact with the carboxyl group of GABA. This would be reminiscent of the role of Arg447 of the glutamate transporter EAAC-1 in binding the γ-carboxyl group of glutamate (40Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the other amino acid transporters, this conserved arginine could play a similar role. Determinants located in the highly conserved transmembrane domain I influence the affinity of the transporter for sodium (Figs. 5C and 7), the ability of sodium to inhibit the leak currents (Figs.5 D, 8, and 9 B), the potassium/lithium selectivity of the leak currents (Fig. 9 A), and the interconversion of the leak to transport mode (Figs. 2 and 3). Consistent with the possibility of a direct involvement of at least one amino acid residue of transmembrane domain I in permeation is the fact that the position of Gly63 located in the middle of this domain appears to be accessible via an aqueous pathway to the extracellular medium (Fig. 3). The simultaneous effects of the mutations on GABA transport and the leak mode suggest that the permeation pathway of these two modes may share common structural elements.

The data suggest that calcium and glutamate might induce FtsZ polymerization by different mechanisms. piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) FtsZ, a 40.3-kDa protein, is a key protein involved in prokaryotic cell division (1Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. Nature. 1991; 354: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 2Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It forms the structural element called Z-ring at the site of cell division, and it remains associated with the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane throughout the septation process (3Rothfield L.I. Justice S.S. Cell. 1997; 88: 581-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Homologs of FtsZ have been found in every free-living prokaryote examined to date (4Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6726-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Margolin W. Wang R. Kumar M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Wang X. Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), including many species of Archaea. It has also been found in chloroplasts of higher plants, where it is involved in chloroplast division (7Kiesseling J. Kruse S. Rensing S.A. Harter K. Decker E.L. Reski R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Its wide distribution and high degree of sequence conservation suggest that it probably plays a similar role in all bacterial and archaeal species (8Gilson P.R. Beech P.L. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 10Erickson H.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 367-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Consistent with its cytoskeletal role, FtsZ has several properties in common with the eukaryotic cytoskeleton protein, tubulin. Like tubulin, FtsZ binds and hydrolyzes GTP, and it polymerizes to form long tubules in a GTP-dependent manner (11de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 12RayChaudhuri D. Park J.T. Nature. 1992; 359: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 13Mukherjee A. Dai K.

A. 1994; 91: 5813-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has been shown that purified FtsZ polymerizes into structures that closely resemble those formed by purified tubulin (15Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FtsZ shows limited but significant sequence similarity to tubulin. Sequence alignment of FtsZ and tubulin reveals that several structural glycine and proline residues and most of the residues that are involved in GTP binding are conserved. In addition, FtsZ contains the tubulin signature GTP binding sequence motif GGGTG(T/S)G (11de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 12RayChaudhuri D. Park J.T. Nature. 1992; 359: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 16Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of FtsZ from Methanococcus jannaschii has been determined (17Lowe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). FtsZ has two domains arranged around a central helix. GTPase activity is localized in the amino terminus domain of the protein, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain function is still unknown (17Lowe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of FtsZ also shows striking similarities with α and β tubulin (18Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Furthermore, molecular phylogenetic data indicate that an archaeal FtsZ is the most tubulin-like of all prokaryotic FtsZ proteins found so far, suggesting that tubulin may have evolved from an ancestral FtsZ (5Margolin W. Wang R. Kumar M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At low concentrations, purified FtsZ monomers polymerize into single-stranded protofilaments with little or no bundling of protofilaments in an assembly reaction that is believed to be isodesmic (non-cooperative) in nature (19Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of DEAE-dextran (15Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 20Erickson H.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 133-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or high concentrations of calcium (21Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) FtsZ monomers polymerize into long, rod-shaped or tubular polymers that become extensively bundled. The assembly reaction is stimulated, and resulting polymers are stabilized by these agents. These studies demonstrate that the extent and nature of the polymer formed highly depends on the reaction conditions. Interestingly, calcium exerts contrasting effects on the polymerization of FtsZ and microtubules. Calcium strongly inhibits tubulin assembly and depolymerizes microtubules, whereas it promotes FtsZ assembly and induces bundling of FtsZ filaments (23Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have been carried out to study the effect of various factors such as temperature and pH on FtsZ polymerization (24Addinall S.G. Cao C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4277-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Yu X.C. Margolin W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6203-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gomez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Many inducers of tubulin polymerization have been identified over the years, and these modulators of polymerization have been extensively utilized to understand the molecular mechanism of microtubule polymerization dynamics (27Wordeman L. Mitchison T.J. Hyams J. Lloyd C. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 287-301Google Scholar); however, only a few inducers of FtsZ polymerization have thus far been identified. In this study we found that monosodium glutamate is a potent inducer of FtsZ polymerization, and it stabilizes FtsZ polymers against disassembly. Electron micrographs showed that glutamate-induced FtsZ polymers form extensive bundles. Furthermore, glutamate decreased the GTPase activity of FtsZ. The property of filament bundling may be important in FtsZ function in the septation process. In addition, calcium and glutamate exerted differential effects on FtsZ polymerization, indicating that they modulate FtsZ polymerization through different mechanisms. Pipes,1monosodium glutamate, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, bovine serum albumin, and GTP were obtained from Sigma. DE-52 was from Whatman International Ltd. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Recombinant Escherichia coli FtsZ was overexpressed and purified from BL21 strain (a gift from Dr. H. P. Erickson, Duke University) as described earlier (28Lu C. Erickson H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin until they reached early log phase (A 600 ∼ 0.4–0.6) when protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min and suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm MgSO4) on ice. Cells were lysed by sonication with 20-s pulses at 30-s intervals between the pulses for four cycles. Partially lysed cells were further disrupted using a Polytron homogenizer (Polytron PT-3000). Lysozyme (0.4 mg/ml) was added to the partially lysed cell suspension, which then was incubated on ice for 1 h. It was again incubated with 10 mm MgSO4 for 5 min, and the suspension was sonicated for 6 cycles with 20-s pulses. The insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell-free supernatant was saturated to 25% with ammonium sulfate solution and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The protein suspension was centrifuged at 27,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8) and dialyzed against the same buffer for 4 h. Purification of FtsZ was further carried out using DE-52 ion exchange column chromatography as described previously (13Mukherjee A. Dai K. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, FtsZ was loaded on a DE-52 column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8), and the protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of KCl. FtsZ-containing fractions were eluted at 250 mm KCl; protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). These fractions were pooled together and concentrated using Amicon Centriplus concentrators at 4 °C. One cycle of temperature-dependent polymerization and depolymerization was then used to further purify the FtsZ. The polymerization reaction was carried out in buffer containing 25 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgSO4, 10 mmCaCl2, 1 m monosodium glutamate, and 1 mm GTP at 37 °C for 30 min. FtsZ polymers were sedimented by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 27 °C. The pellet was resuspended on ice in 25 mmPipes buffer (pH 6.8), and the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble aggregates. The FtsZ concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and FtsZ was frozen and stored at −80 °C. FtsZ (6 μm) was prepared in 25 mm Pipes buffer (pH 6.8) and 3 mm MgSO4 (buffer A) in the absence and presence of different concentrations of monosodium glutamate on ice. After the addition of 1 mm GTP, the sample was immediately placed in a cuvette at 37 °C, and the polymerization reaction was monitored at 37 °C by light scattering at 500 nm using a JASCO 6500 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 500 nm. FtsZ (6 μm) was polymerized in buffer A containing 1 mm GTP in the absence and presence of different concentrations of sodium glutamate for 30 min at 37 °C. The polymers were collected by sedimenting them at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 27 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. FtsZ (6 μm) was polymerized at 37 °C in buffer A with 1 mm GTP and in the absence or presence of 1 m glutamate for 30 min. The FtsZ polymers in the samples were fixed with prewarmed 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. Twenty-microliter volumes of protein samples were transferred onto carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh) and blotted dry. The grids were subsequently negatively stained with a few drops of 2% uranyl acetate solution and air-dried. The samples were examined using a JEOL-JEM 100S or a Philips CM 200 electron microscope. FtsZ (1 mg/ml) was polymerized in buffer A with 10 mm calcium and 1 mm GTP at 37 °C for 30 min. The protein solution was then diluted 20 times to reach a final FtsZ concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in different concentrations of warm glutamate. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet obtained were dissolved in 30 μl of 25 mm Pipes buffer containing 0.5% SDS, and 20 μl of each sample was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The intensity of the bands was determined by a gel documentation system obtained from Kodak Digital Science. A malachite green sodium molybdate assay was used to measure the production of inorganic phosphate during GTP hydrolysis (19Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 30Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Samples containing 6 μm FtsZ with different concentrations of glutamate were prepared in buffer A at 0 °C, and 1 mm GTP was added to the reaction mixtures. Immediately, the reaction mixtures were transferred to 37 °C and incubated for different lengths of time. The hydrolysis reaction was quenched at desired time points by the addition of 10% v/v 7m perchloric acid to the reaction mixtures, and the quenched reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 5 min to remove aggregated proteins. Twenty microliters of the supernatants were incubated with 900 μl of filtered malachite green solution (0.045% malachite green, 4.2% ammonium molybdate, and 0.02% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 30 min, and the phosphate ions produced were determined by measuring the absorbance of samples at 650 nm. The reaction was normalized including a control without FtsZ. A phosphate standard curve was prepared using sodium phosphate. FtsZ and its eukaryotic homolog tubulin are both known to undergo multiple temperature-dependent polymerization and depolymerization cycles in the presence of GTP (31Scheffers D.J. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The polymerization of tubulin is well understood, and several inducers of tubulin assembly in vitro are known. The purification procedure for tubulin involves temperature- and GTP-dependent polymerization and depolymerization cycles followed by phosphocellulose chromatography, which not only increases the purity level of the protein but also increases the yield of the assembly-competent fraction of tubulin (32Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 33Billger M.A. Bhatacharya G. Williams R.C. Jr. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13656-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the tubulin literature, we sought to find inducers of FtsZ polymerization. We tried several well known agents that promote tubulin polymerization including dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), glycerol, taxol, and glutamate (34Himes R.H. Burton P.R. Kersey R.N. Pierson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4397-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Keates R.A. Briochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Hamel E. Lin C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast to their effects on tubulin polymerization, 4 m glycerol, 10% v/v Me2SO, and 10 μm taxol did not show any effect on FtsZ polymerization (data not shown). However, glutamate did enhance FtsZ assembly in a concentration range similar to the concentration range that enhances tubulin polymerization (Fig. 1). Several groups have routinely purified FtsZ from crude extracts using a cation exchange (DE-52) chromatographic procedure (13Mukherjee A. Dai K. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 28Lu C. Erickson H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to the purification procedure used for tubulin, we introduced a glutamate-induced temperature-dependent polymerization and depolymerization cycle after the DE-52 column to further purify FtsZ while keeping its activity intact (“Experimental Procedures”). The combination of a cycle of polymerization and depolymerization with DE-52 chromatography yielded FtsZ of high purity (>98%) as analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Our goal was to discover modulators of FtsZ polymerization, which could be further used to understand the basic mechanisms of FtsZ polymerization and the roles of FtsZ polymerization in bacterial cell division. Monosodium glutamate increased the rate and extent of FtsZ polymerization in a concentration-dependant manner with an optimal effect at a concentration of 1 m (Fig. 1 A). To further demonstrate that glutamate is a potent inducer of FtsZ polymerization, the rate and extent of FtsZ (8 μm) polymerization was first monitored for 10 min by light scattering in the absence of glutamate. After 10 min, 1 m glutamate was added to the cuvette from a stock of 2 m warm glutamate, and the polymerization reaction was monitored for an additional 15 min. The addition of 1 m warm glutamate strikingly increased the magnitude of the light-scattering signal, and an apparent steady state was achieved quickly (Fig. 1 B). To verify whether the increase in the light-scattering signal was due to a genuine increase in the FtsZ polymerization, we measured the mass of polymeric FtsZ in the presence of different concentrations of glutamate (Fig. 2). The FtsZ polymer mass clearly increased with increasing concentrations of glutamate. Between 85 and 92% of the initial protein could be sedimented as polymer mass in the presence of 1 m glutamate. To find out whether glutamate-induced FtsZ polymerization was temperature-dependent or not, 6 μm FtsZ was incubated with 1 m glutamate plus 1 mm GTP in buffer A for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C as previously described in Fig. 2. Then the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured, and it was found to be identical with the total protein concentration used in the assay (data not shown). The result showed that no glutamate-induced polymerization occurred at 4 °C. However, ∼90% of the total protein formed sedimentable polymers at 37 °C, indicating that the polymerization reaction is temperature-dependent. Electron micrographic analysis of the FtsZ polymer showed formation of a dense network of FtsZ polymers in the presence of 1 mglutamate (Fig. 3, B andC), whereas only a few polymeric filamentous structures were formed in the absence of glutamate (Fig. 3, A andD). Furthermore, analysis of the electron micrographs showed that sodium glutamate not only increased the amount of polymer but also induced formation of large filamentous polymeric structures with extensive bundle formations (Fig. 3, E andF). We wanted to determine whether glutamate could stabilize FtsZ polymers against dilution-induced disassembly. FtsZ (1 mg/ml) was initially polymerized with 10 mm calcium in the presence of 1 mm GTP. The polymerized FtsZ was diluted 20 times to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml FtsZ into buffers containing different concentrations of warm monosodium glutamate at 37 °C. After 30 min of incubation, FtsZ polymers were sedimented, and the protein concentrations in the pellets were quantified using Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4,A and B), which clearly showed that the amount of polymeric protein increased with increasing glutamate concentration. For example, the polymer content increased by 9.2-fold in the presence of 1 m glutamate as compared with the control value. Thus, the data indicated that glutamate stabilizes FtsZ polymers and prevents their dilution-induced disassembly. FtsZ is a GTPase, and the polymerization of FtsZ is thought to be regulated by GTP hydrolysis (14Bramhill D. Thompson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5813-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 37Mukherjee A. Leutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Initially, we wanted to know whether GTP is essential for glutamate-induced FtsZ polymerization. The FtsZ polymerization reaction was carried out for 10 min in the presence of 1m glutamate without GTP. There was no development of light scattering (Fig. 5 A). After 10 min, 1 mm GTP was added to the cuvette, and the polymerization was immediately started, demonstrating that GTP is required for glutamate-induced polymerization of FtsZ. Similarly, GTP was also found to be essential for calcium-induced polymerization of FtsZ (Fig. 5 A). Because GTP was found to be essential for the glutamate-induced assembly of FtsZ, we sought to determine the effects of glutamate on the GTPase activity of FtsZ. Monosodium glutamate decreased the rate of GTP hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). For example, 1 m glutamate reduced the amount of hydrolyzed GTP of FtsZ by ∼50%. Interestingly, GTP hydrolysis occurred at a significantly higher rate in the initial stage of the reaction than the late stage of the reaction (Table I). For example, in the absence of glutamate, 5 and 30 min of the hydrolysis reaction produced 69 ± 11 and 103 ± 8 mol of phosphate ions, respectively. However, in the presence of 1 mglutamate, 36 ± 7 and 56 ± 4 mol of phosphate ions were produced after 5 and 30 min of hydrolysis reaction (Table I). Glutamate stabilized the FtsZ polymers (Fig. 4, A and B) and induced an extensive bundling of FtsZ polymers (Fig. 3,E and F); thus, the reduction in the GTPase activity of FtsZ polymers by monosodium glutamate could be due to the enhanced stability of the FtsZ polymers.Table IEffects of glutamate on the GTPase activity of FtsZGlutamate concentrationPhosphate ions produced/mol of FtsZ (± S.D.)5 min30 minm0.0069 ± 11103 ± 80.2574 ± 10122 ± 90.5056 ± 5101 ± 90.7553 ± 782 ± 31.0036 ± 756 ± 4The FtsZ concentration was 6 μm. Open table in a new tab The FtsZ concentration was 6 μm. Recently, it has been shown that high millimolar concentrations of calcium enhance the rate and the extent of FtsZ polymerization and promote the formation of tubulin-like protofilaments in the polymers (21Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, it was interesting to compare the effects of glutamate and calcium on FtsZ polymerization. As previously reported, we also found that calcium induced polymerization of FtsZ, as evident from the increase in light scattering (Fig. 6 A). However, glutamate (1m) strikingly increased the magnitude of light scattering compared with 10 mm calcium (Fig. 6 A). The increased light scattering by glutamate compared with calcium might be due to an increase in the polymer mass, to changes in the size and shape of the polymers, or to a combination of both the factors. To discern the possibilities, a sedimentation assay and electron microscopy were performed. We found that similar amounts of polymeric FtsZ were sedimented when the polymerization reaction was initiated by either 10 mm calcium or 1 m glutamate (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the observed increase in the light-scattering intensity in the presence of glutamate was not due to an increase in the polymer mass. The electron micrographs of FtsZ polymers formed in the presence of 10 mm calcium are shown in Fig. 6 C. These polymers are similar to previously reported calcium-induced FtsZ polymers (21Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, large filamentous structures containing thick bundles of FtsZ polymers were more abundant in the presence of 1 m glutamate (Fig. 3) compared with calcium (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, the observed increase in light scattering in the presence of glutamate must be due to extensive bundling of FtsZ polymers. In this report we found that monosodium glutamate increased the rate and extent of FtsZ polymerization. It also enhanced the bundling of FtsZ filaments, and it stabilized the polymers against dilution-induced disassembly. At low protein concentrations, FtsZ assembly reaction is believed to be isodesmic (non-cooperative). Under these conditions, FtsZ monomers assemble into single-stranded polymers with few protofilament bundles (19Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, polycations such as DEAE-dextran and calcium have been shown to modify the morphology of FtsZ polymers. In the presence of DEAE-dextran, FtsZ protofilaments associate to form three-dimensional sheets (20Erickson H.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 133-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Lu C.L. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and millimolar concentrations of calcium-pronounced bundling of FtsZ filaments have been observed by several groups (21Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that DEAE-dextran and calcium increase the lateral interactions between the protofilaments (20Erickson H.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 133-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 39Scheffers D.J. den Blaawuen T. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions play an important role in FtsZ assembly. It was proposed previously that drugs like bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate inhibits FtsZ polymerization, presumably by blocking intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between FtsZ molecules (40Yu X.C. Margolin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10216-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas binding of calcium or DEAE dextran to FtsZ increases the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions, resulting in stimulation of FtsZ assembly (22Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 38Lu C.L. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In our experiments we found that the glutamate increased the rate and extent of the FtsZ polymerization to an optimal effect at a concentration of 1 m. At the optimal concentration of glutamate, FtsZ polymerization was biphasic, with a rapid burst phase of polymerization followed by a slower and prolonged linear phase (Fig. 1 A). Electron micrographs of glutamate-enhanced FtsZ polymers showed large filamentous structures with extensive bundles (Fig. 3). These polymeric structures were somewhat similar to the FtsZ polymers formed in the presence of high concentrations of calcium (22Lowe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); however, more bundles were present in the presence of glutamate compared with calcium. The results indicated that, like calcium, glutamate could increase the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions in FtsZ and stabilize the polymers by enhancing bundle formation. The slower phase of polymerization observed by light scattering could be due to the formation of the FtsZ polymer bundles. Furthermore, when preformed FtsZ polymer was diluted into different concentrations of glutamate, the polymers were found to be 9 times more stable in the presence of 1 m glutamate compared with no glutamate (Fig. 4). This shows that glutamate not only enhanced the FtsZ polymer formation but also stabilizes the preformed polymers. Kinetics of nucleotide hydrolysis is important to describe the model for FtsZ polymerization. The active site for GTP hydrolysis in FtsZ is postulated to form when the T7 loop of a FtsZ monomer binds with the nucleotide-binding site on an adjacent FtsZ monomer (41Scheffers D.J. de Wit J.G. den Blaawuen T. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It was also thought that, like microtubules, FtsZ polymers could also be stabilized by a GTP cap (39Scheffers D.J. den Blaawuen T. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). But recently Scheffers and Driessen (42Scheffers D.J. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1517-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that GTP hydrolysis occurs immediately after the addition of GTP to FtsZ, and FtsZ polymers contain mostly GDP and inorganic phosphate rather than GTP (42Scheffers D.J. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1517-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). FtsZ assembly does not require magnesium or calcium, but magnesium is required for dynamic behavior of FtsZ polymers (43Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas calcium at high concentrations induces the bundling of polymers, which reduces the dynamic behavior of FtsZ assembly (23Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of magnesium, calcium inhibits GTP hydrolysis and reduces the dynamic nature of FtsZ polymers by making the polymers more stable. Our experiment showed that glutamate decreased the GTPase activity of FtsZ (Fig. 5). Glutamate might stabilize FtsZ polymers by increasing hydrophobic interactions between subunits and enhancing bundle formation, which decreased the dynamics of the polymers. Thus, the increased stability of FtsZ could reduce the rate of subunit exchange, which might be the cause of suppression of its GTPase activity. However, it is also difficult to rule out the possibility that the reduction in the GTPase activity of FtsZ by glutamate could also be responsible for higher stability of the polymers. Calcium induces polymerization of FtsZ (Fig. 6 and Ref. 21Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glutamate strikingly increased the rate and extent of the development of the light-scattering signal of FtsZ polymerization compared with calcium (Fig. 6 A). However, the polymer mass was found to be similar in the presence of either glutamate or calcium. Electron micrographs of FtsZ polymers showed that glutamate caused extensive bundling of polymers compared with the degree of bundling caused by calcium, indicating that glutamate induces different conformational changes in the polymer than does calcium. Because 10 mm calcium alone was sufficient to polymerize most of the FtsZ, the increased intensity in the light scattering signal during FtsZ polymerization in the presence of 1 m glutamate must be due to the rearrangement of FtsZ polymers into thicker bundles rather than to an increase in polymer mass. The data indicate not only the presence of different modulator sites on FtsZ but also different mechanisms of FtsZ polymerization. Tubulin, the eukaryotic homolog of FtsZ, is also known to form different types of polymers, including microtubules, open sheets (in the presence of zinc and Me2SO), double rings and isodesmic aggregates (in the presence of vinblastine), although only microtubules are responsible for the functional properties of tubulin (34Himes R.H.

Interestingly, we found that the common inducers of tubulin assembly such as Me2SO, glycerol, and taxol had no effect on FtsZ polymerization (data not shown). It has been reported that high concentrations of glutamate stabilize tubulin and induce its polymerization. Glutamate increases the GTPase activity in tubulin and thereby enhances the rate of polymerization of tubulin into microtubules (36Hamel E. Lin C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that glutamate strongly suppressed the GTPase activity of FtsZ. The binding of glutamate to tubulin is thought to induce localized opening or disordering of tubulin subunits without any major reorganization of the internal structure of tubulin (46Sackett D.L. Knutson J.R. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14899-14906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data together indicate that glutamate interacts with FtsZ in a manner different from that of tubulin or microtubules. FtsZ polymerizes to form a dynamic ring marking the division plane of prokaryotic cells and plays an essential role in cytokinesis (1Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. Nature. 1991; 354: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 3Rothfield L.I. Justice S.S. Cell. 1997; 88: 581-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite its actin-like role, FtsZ has structural and biochemical similarity to tubulin (5Margolin W. Wang R. Kumar M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 15Erickson H.P.

Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Tubulin, the eukaryotic homolog of FtsZ, has been successfully targeted for the development of anticancer and antifungal drugs (47Panda D. Miller H.P. Islam K. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10560-10564Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 48Panda D. DeLuca K. Williams D. Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Lond.). 2002; 9: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential use of FtsZ as a drug target for the development of antimicrobial agents needs to be explored. Several potent inhibitors of tubulin assembly including colchicine and vinblastine have no effect on FtsZ assembly, suggesting that these drugs do not interact with FtsZ (40Yu X.C. Margolin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10216-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calcium depolymerizes microtubules (51Kirschner M.W. Williams R.C. Weingarten M. Gerhart J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas it promotes the polymerization of FtsZ. Furthermore, glycerol, Me2SO and taxol are well characterized inducers of microtubule assembly, but these agents do not induce FtsZ assembly, suggesting that the polymerization reaction of FtsZ is mechanistically different from that of tubulin assembly. The finding of new modulators of FtsZ assembly-like glutamate would certainly help to characterize FtsZ polymerization and may help to search for new inhibitors. For example, a screen could be designed in which inhibitors of glutamate-induced polymerization might be identified. We thank Dr. H. P. Erickson for providing us the FtsZ clone. We thank Drs. Leslie Wilson, D. Dasgupta, and S. Pathare for critical reading of the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2002155047,"Agonist-induced rigid body motion of transmembrane (TM) helices has been established as a unifying mechanism in the activation of the G protein-coupled receptors. In attempts to measure specific conformational transitions during the activation of the type 1 receptor for angiotensin II (AT1), we found a decrease in accessibility of Cys76 in the second TM helix, suggesting that the orientation of TM2 is altered (Miura, S., and Karnik, S. S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 24299–24305). Now we provide evidence that the TM2 helical movement plays a role in regulating the activated state of the AT1 receptor, and this role may involve an interaction between TM2 and TM7. Alanine substitution of native Cys296in TM7 leads to increased accessibility of Cys289 and diminished response to bound agonist. Both effects of the C296A mutation are suppressed when combined with F77A and N111G mutants. The TM7 conformation and the sensitivity of Cys289 altered by C296A mutation are suppressed by the F77A mutation in TM2 to salvage function. We show that the F77A mutant alters orientation of both TM2 and TM7 but does not induce constitutive activity in suppressing the C296A mutant effects. Thus, interaction of TM2 and TM7 is important for transmembrane signal transduction in the AT1 receptor.

Diverse endogenous ligands such as endocrine hormones, neurotransmitters, ions, peptides, proteases, glycoproteins, and sensory signals can activate these receptors (1Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Activated GPCRs recruit intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins and stimulate GTP/GDP exchange to initiate receptor-specific signals. Although, their structure-function relationships vary markedly, a seven TM helical structure is essential for signal transduction by GPCRs. Therefore, activation of GPCRs has been proposed to involve a common molecular mechanism i.e.rigid body movement of TM helices (2Gether U. Endo. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 3Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).

The type 1 (AT1) receptor for the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) is a member of the GPCR superfamily (Fig.1). It is an important target for drug development because abnormalities in its function are linked to hypertension, water-electrolyte imbalance, hyperaldosteronism, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (4De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of AT1receptor by Ang II and its subsequent coupling to G proteins, Gq/11, results in phospholipase C (PLC) activation, inositol phosphate accumulation, and smooth muscle contraction (4De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II binding involves TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 helices. Following binding, interaction of Ang II-Tyr4 with Asn111and Ang II-Phe8 with His256 (see Fig. 1) leads the AT1 receptor from an inactive (R) to activated state (R*) (5Karnik S.S. Husain A. Graham R.M. Drugs, Enzymes and Receptors of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Celebrating a Century of Discovery. Harwood Academic Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 117-130Google Scholar, 6Hunyady L. Gaborik Z. Vauquelin G. Catt K.J. J. Ren. Ang. Aldo. System. 2001; 2: S16-S23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Substitution of Asn111 in the TM3 results in constitutive activation of the receptor (5Karnik S.S. Husain A. Graham R.M. Drugs, Enzymes and Receptors of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Celebrating a Century of Discovery. Harwood Academic Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 117-130Google Scholar). The conservation of agonist-receptor contacts and induction of constitutive activation indicates that Ang II may activate AT1 receptor by inducing rigid body motion of TM helices, as in the case of other GPCRs. However, the specific conformational changes essential for activation of the AT1 receptor are mostly unknown. Recently, we showed that reduction of Asn111 side chain size in the AT1 receptor resulted in different degrees of constitutive activation (7Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reporter Cys-accessibility mapping (RCAM) in these mutants demonstrated different degrees of accessibility of the TM2 residue, Cys76, to methanethiosulfonyl-ethylaminoacetate (MTSEA) derivatization. This provided the first evidence of TM2 helical movement during AT1 receptor activation. An exhaustive mapping of conformational changes in other helices was, however, hampered because the MTSEA reactivity of the remaining native Cys residues is not known. Therefore, we reasoned that the construction of an AT1receptor CYS− mutant that lacks all free Cys residues would be a useful template for mapping the conformational changes in all TM helices. Hence, we constructed and evaluated single or combinatorial replacements of free Cys residues in the AT1receptor. We unexpectedly discovered that substitution of native Cys296 induces a change in the orientation of TM7, accompanied with functional defects. We show here that both effects induced by C296A mutation are abolished in a mutant located in the TM2. Taken together, these findings expose a critical role of TM2-TM7 interaction in coupling helical movements to G protein activation.

The binding experiments were stopped by filtering the binding mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, which were extensively washed further with binding buffer. The bound ligand fraction was determined from the counts per min remaining on the membrane. Binding kinetics were determined using the computer program Ligand®. TheK d and B max values represent the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent determinations. Aliquots of cell membranes (20 μl) were incubated with or without MTS reagents at the stated concentrations (0.1–12.5 mm) at 22 °C for the indicated time (2–10 min) in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction mix was then diluted 100-fold with cold buffer to stop the reaction and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 ×g at 4 °C, then resuspended in 200 μl. A 150-μl aliquot was used for125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding analysis. The percent inhibition of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding was calculated using the formula 1−[(specific binding after MTS-reagent)/(specific binding without reagent)] × 100%. The values represent the mean ± S.E. of four to ten independent determinations. Semi-confluent COS1 cells transfected in 60-mm Petri dishes were labeled for 24 h with [3H]myoinositol (1.5 μCi/ml), specific activity 22 μCi/mol (Amersham Biosciences), at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The labeled cells were washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and incubated with HBSS containing 10 mmLiCl for 20 min. Agonists were then added and incubation continued for another 45 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the medium was removed, and the total soluble IP was extracted from the cells by the perchloric acid extraction method, as described previously (7Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The values represent the mean ± S.E. of three to four independent determinations. Exposure of native Cys residues to water-accessible ligand pocket was measured by employing a highly reactive, sulfhydryl-specific reaction with MTSEA. Water-exposed Cys residues ionize and react a billion times faster with MTSEA, which is > 3000-fold more soluble in water than membrane (7Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol.

This reaction results in the addition of a positively charged sulfonylmethylammonium group onto water-exposed Cys via a mixed disulfide bond. When the Cys is in the ligand pocket, the modification interferes with the125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II binding either through steric hindrance or electrostatic repulsion. Exposure of the wild-type AT1 receptor to MTSEA+ reagent for ∼10 min abolished specific binding of the peptide antagonist 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II by nearly 70% (Fig.2 A). The kinetics of inhibition is dependent on the concentration of the MTS reagent and the time of reaction. Based on the observation presented in Fig.2 A, a 2-min reaction with 2.5 mmMTSEA+ was used for the analysis of various mutants. Binding inhibition caused by MTSEA reaction is irreversible and leads to a decrease in the B max (Fig. 2 A). We reported earlier that the negatively charged MTSES− and the uncharged methyl-MTS did not inhibit125I-[Sar1, Ile8]Ang II binding because these two reagents reacted poorly with the wild-type AT1 receptor. In the presence of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, the AT1 receptor was protected against reaction with MTSEA+ (see Ref. 7Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To identify one or more native Cys residue(s) of the AT1receptor that reacted with MTS reagents to inhibit antagonist binding we replaced individual Cys residues with Ala (Fig. 1). These residues located in the putative TM (Cys76, Cys121, Cys149, Cys289, and Cys296) and cytoplasmic (Cys355) domains are thought to be not involved in disulfide bond formation. A CYS− mutant AT1receptor that lacked all non-disulfide-bonded Cys residues was constructed. Three double Cys replacement mutants and three triple Cys mutants also resulted during the stepwise construction of CYS− mutant AT1 receptor (see TableI). The affinity of these mutants was not significantly different from that of the WT receptor for125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (Table I), indicating that single or multiple Ala substitutions did not affect the global conformation of the receptor. We conclude that preservation of the disulfide bonds proposed for the AT1 receptor in previous reports (4De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar) is necessary and sufficient for generating a functional receptor (Fig. 1), and the other native Cys residues are not likely to be involved in conferring ligand selectivity. This finding also indicates that native Cys residues in the AT1 receptor could be used as conformational sensors.Table ILigand-affinity, B max , and maximal and IP stimulation values for wild-type and mutant AT 1 receptorsReceptorK d[Sar1, Ile8]Ang IILosartanBmaxIP production [% of WT]1-aThe values represent total inositol phosphates measured in COS1 cells transfected with WT and mutant AT1 receptor expression plasmids (10 μg DNA/107 cells) in three independent experiments.

Reaction with 2.5 mm MTSEA+ for 2 min inhibited antagonist binding by ∼28 ± 4% in the WT, C121A, C149A, and C355A mutant receptors. In the C76A and CYS− mutants, binding was resistant to reaction with MTSEA+ (Fig. 2,A and B). These findings are consistent with our earlier conclusion that inhibition of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding is due to the reaction of MTSEA+ with Cys76 in the TM2 helix, and the remaining free Cys residues are not involved (7Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The C289A mutant consistently displayed reduced sensitivity to MTSEA, but the magnitude of its reactivity is very small. In contrast, both the magnitude and rate of initial reaction with the MTSEA+was enhanced in the C296A mutant receptor, suggesting that this mutation may have perturbed the conformation of the receptor (Fig. 2,A and B). Competition binding studies with the AT1 receptor-selective nonpeptide antagonist losartan revealed an 11-fold reduction of affinity for C296A compared with the WT receptor. Substitution of Cys296 with Gly, Ile, and Phe also reduced the affinity for losartan (Table I). These mutants also displayed reduced coupling to IP production. Previous mutagenesis (6Hunyady L. Gaborik Z. Vauquelin G. Catt K.J. J. Ren. Ang. Aldo. System. 2001; 2: S16-S23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) studies have indicated that TM7 plays an important role in nonpeptide antagonist-selectivity and signal activation. Based on these observations, we speculate that C296A mutation perturbs receptor conformation, leading to increased accessibility of one or more native Cys residues. The accessibility of remaining native Cys residues in various combinations with the C296A mutation was investigated. As illustrated in Fig. 2 C, the C296A mutant contains at least two MTSEA-reactive cysteines. The binding of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II is not sensitive to MTSEA reaction when both Cys76 and Cys289 are replaced in the C296A mutant. Only 50% of MTSEA-inhibition of binding was observed in C76A/C296A/C355A, C76A/C149A/C296A, C76A/C121A/C296A, and C76A/C296A mutants compared with the C296A mutant. The reduction is consistent with loss of the Cys76 residue, which is normally reactive. The MTSEA-sensitivity of the mutant C289A/C296A compared with that of the mutants C76A/C289A/C296A, C76A, C289A, and C296A indicates that the remaining 50% inhibition is consistent with acquired reactivity of Cys289 in these mutants (Fig. 2 C). The analysis indicates that the C296A mutation induced an increase in the accessibility of Cys289 without altering the accessibility of Cys76. The structural consequence of C296A mutation was simulated in a homology model of the AT1 receptor molecule 2D. C. Teller, V. C. Yee, and S. Karnik, unpublished results. constructed based on x-ray diffraction coordinates of bovine rhodopsin (1Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 12Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). In our model, the Cys296 side chain is located in an elongated part of the helix that bends toward TM2, and its side chain is buried. Conformation simulated with Ala296 indicated more flexibility to the TM7 region that would allow interaction with the surrounding lipids. The C296A mutation potentially could cause an increased sensitivity of Cys289 through local change of TM7-conformation without affecting other native Cys residues in the AT1 receptor. We conclude that the acquired MTSEA-sensitivity of Cys289 due to C296A mutation reflects a conformational change of TM7 (rotating and/or tilting), resulting in movement of Cys289 into the water-accessible ligand-binding pocket. Pharmacological evidence for a specific interaction between TM2 and TM7 in the AT1 receptor was reported in an earlier study (11Marie J. Maigret B. Joseph M.P. Larguier R. Nouet S. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20815-20818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion, the AT1 receptor molecular model also indicated that the TM7 region containing the Cys296 interacts extensively with TM2. Therefore, we looked for compensatory mutations in the TM2 helix and found that Ile, Cys, Ala, and Gly substitutions of Phe77 in TM2 rescued the C296A-induced MTSEA-sensitivity of Cys289 (see Fig. 2 D). These substitutions produced a gradual decrease of MTSEA inactivation of binding. Cys76 is not sensitive to MTSEA inactivation in these mutants as it is in the wild-type. This conclusion is supported by the MTSEA-resistance of the double mutants F77A/C76A and F77A/C289A. We speculate that smaller side chains substituted for Phe77perhaps alter the environment of Cys76, a residue that is normally MTSEA-accessible. In the AT1 receptor molecular model, the side chain of Phe77 is located at the boundary between the water-accessible ligand pocket and hydrophobic protein core with bonding proximity to residues Tyr292-Phe293-Asn294 located on TM7. Therefore, smaller residues substituted for Phe77could potentially cause a rearrangement of both TM2 and TM7 within the TM bundle to accommodate the space created in the protein core. Consequently, the environment around the conformational sensor Cys76 on TM2 could be more hydrophobic. Cysteines placed in hydrophobic environment do not ionize; hence, MTSEA-insensitivity of Cys76 in the F77A mutants is consistent with the model. Whether the small residues substituted for Phe77 affect TM7 conformation is not clear. The MTSEA resistance noted in the F77A mutant does not necessarily exclude a potential conformational change in TM7. Because the conformation-sensor residue Cys289 in TM7 is not very reactive (see Fig. 1 A), a further decrease in the MTSEA-sensitivity, if it occurred in the Phe77mutants, is difficult to detect. An increase in its reactivity should be measurable, but not actually found in these mutants. The F77A/C296A double mutant displayed MTSEA inactivation kinetics, which is comparable with that of the WT receptor. The MTSEA-sensitivity of Cys289 induced by the C296A mutation and the accessibility of Cys76 decreased by the F77A mutation are masked in this double mutant. Rather surprisingly, the MTSEA inactivation of the F77A/C289A/C296A mutant demonstrated that ∼75% of inhibition of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding is due to reaction with Cys76. The inactivation of the triple mutant F77A/C76A/C296A indicated that ∼25% of inhibition is due to accessibility of Cys289. Furthermore, the change in MTSEA-reactivity was accompanied by an increase of affinity for losartan and restoration of agonist-induced IP stimulation in comparison to the C296A mutant (Table I). Reactivity of other native Cys residues did not change (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the properties of C77A/C296A mutant are more “wild-type-like” than “F77A-like” or “C296A-like.” The local effects caused by F77A and C296A individual mutations, respectively, on TM2 and TM7 could cancel out in the F77A/C296A double mutant. The conformation of the TM helical bundle in this mutant mimics the packing of helices in the WT receptor as suggested by antagonist-binding profiles, regained MTSEA-sensitivity of Cys76 and the decreased sensitivity of Cys289. In rhodopsin, interaction between TM3 and TM6 was initially deduced from compensatory effects of individual mutations and was later confirmed by the high-resolution structure (2Gether U. Endo. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 3Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Similarly, an ionic lock between cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6 was demonstrated in the β2-adrenergic receptor (2Gether U. Endo. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 10Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Functional interaction between TM2 and TM7 is observed in many GPCRs. Spatial proximity and intermolecular interactions between TM2 and TM7 have been observed in the crystallographic structure of bovine rhodopsin (1Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 12Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). The decreased reactivity of Cys76 is a prominent signature of activated receptor conformation in AT1 receptor (7Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hence, the F77A-induced decrease of Cys76-accessibility might indicate altered function. To evaluate the functional consequences of the putative motion of helices observed in Phe77 and Cys296mutants, we measured stimulation of Gq-phospolipase C-mediated IP production in COS1 cells expressing the WT, F77A, C296A, and F77A/C296A receptors. To account for variation of dose-response relationships due to variable receptor expression, IP production per pmol receptor was estimated in each case (see Fig.3). The [Sar1]Ang II potency (EC50 6.2 ± 2 nm) was not significantly different between the WT and F77A/C296A mutant. Compared with these two receptors, the F77A mutant displayed a 3–5-fold increase of potency (EC50 2.0 ± 1 nm) and significantly higher maximal IP response. Previously, a F77S mutant with similar properties was reported (13Parnot C. Bardin S. Miserey-Lenkei S. Guedin D. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7615-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether this potency change is due to possible constitutive activation, the basal activities were measured at different receptor densities. The slope of receptor-density to basal-activity relationship for the WT (0.08 ± 0.001) was not significantly different from that for the F77A mutant (0.09 ± 0.004). Thus, the F77A mutation increased the ligand potency but does not alleviate “the constraint” to induce constitutive activity. In contrast, in the C296A mutant both the potency of [Sar1]Ang II (EC50 14.1 ± 4 nm) and maximal response are reduced, indicating that the C296A mutation-induced effect is unfavorable to receptor activation. This finding implies that the C296A-induced TM7 motion and acquired MTSEA-sensitivity of Cys289 is perhaps a signature for defective receptor activation. We next evaluated these mutation-induced effects on the constitutive activity of the N111G receptor. Constitutive activation results from loss of constraint i.e. a lowering of thermodynamic barrier for conformational changes essential for receptor activation (5Karnik S.S. Husain A. Graham R.M. Drugs, Enzymes and Receptors of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Celebrating a Century of Discovery. Harwood Academic Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 117-130Google Scholar). Fig.3 illustrates elevation of agonist-independent basal intracellular IP accumulation in the N111G-transfected COS1 cells, as reported earlier from this lab. The slope of this basal activity was (1.21 ± 0.2) not significantly affected by introduction of F77A (slope, 0.98 ± 0.09) and F77A/C296A (slope, 0.81 ± 0.07) mutations. The constitutive activity of N111G receptor was not abolished by introduction of C296A mutation, although significant (p> 0.001) reduction of the basal activity was observed in the N111G/C296A double mutant (slope, 0.98 ± 0.2). The [Sar1]Ang II-dependent maximal response was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the F77A/N111G mutant but was not substantially different in the remaining three mutants (see Fig. 3). The F77A mutation-induced conformation favors ligation of the receptor with the agonist, observed as increased potency of [Sar1]Ang II. However, the lack of synergistic effect on the constitutive activity of N111G mutant indicates that Phe77 does not participate in the early step(s) of receptor activation. Most likely, the F77A mutation prolongs the agonist activation, accounting for the higher agonist-dependent maximal response observed in both WT and the N111G mutant. We propose that Phe77 regulates maximal response of the agonist-bound receptor, and this role may depend critically on the ability of TM2 to dynamically interact with TM7. The observations reported here indicate that distinct TM2 and TM7 motions are a mark of functional consequence, thus implicating mutation-induced helical motion in function. For instance, a decrease of Cys76-accessibility indicates TM2 motion in favor of activated receptor conformation, whereas an increase of Cys76-accessibility indicates basal receptor conformation. One of our goals is to decipher unique conformational signatures for each helix and inter-helical loop in the AT1 receptor to enable prediction of functional states of the receptor in a cell free system. Our finding here suggests that a mechanism for dynamic TM2-TM7 interaction is conceivably involved in coupling agonist binding to receptor activation. Interaction between Asp74 in TM2 and Tyr292 in TM7 in the AT1 receptor was predicted. On the basis of this interaction it was proposed that TM2 and TM7 helices move closer to each other in the activated state (11Marie J. Maigret B. Joseph M.P. Larguier R. Nouet S. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20815-20818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Asp74-Tyr292 interaction proposed in the earlier models was not found in our homology model of the AT1 receptor. The model also rules out a direct interaction between Phe77 and Cys296, the two residues studied in this report. However, the basal structure predicted in our modeling simulation lays the groundwork for mechanical interaction between these helices. The TM2-TM7 interface in the model involves bulky aromatic residues (Phe77, Tyr292, and Phe293) mixed with strong polar side chains, forming an extensive hydrogen bonding network (Asn69–Tyr302, Asp74–back bone carbonyl between Asn294 and Asn295, Asp74–water–Asn298, and Thr80–Tyr292) between TM2 and TM7. Previous mutagenesis studies targeting Asp74, Phe77, Tyr292, Asn294, Asn295, Asn298, and Tyr302 indicate that these residues either affect agonist-dependent activation or cause structural defects and affect the affinity for ligands (6Hunyady L.

Photo cross-linking studies identified the Phe293–Asn294 dipeptide region of TM7 as a potential host site for the interaction of the Phe8 side chain of Ang II (15Pérodin J. Deraët M.

Therefore, we propose that any change, brought about by agonists, to the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions stabilizing TM2-TM7, are likely to induce motion of these helices. It appears to us that relative movement of both TM2 and TM7 is critically important for regulation of agonist-activated receptor function. Because a large number of GPCRs are capable of promoting signal transduction in response to diverse ligands, ligand-receptor interactions have been studied in great detail. The mechanism by which the binding of ligand leads to activation of the receptor is only recently beginning to be unraveled (2Gether U. Endo. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 3Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These studies carried out in prototypical GPCRs, rhodopsin, β2-adrenergic receptor, dopamine receptor, α-adrenergic receptors, and muscarinic receptors suggested that receptor activation involves critical conformational changes in TM3 and TM6 (2Gether U. Endo. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 3Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In both rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptor, spectroscopic studies have provided evidence for a rigid body motion of the TM helices. Preventing TM3-TM6 motion prevents receptor-dependent G protein activation, implying that movement of these TM helices is critical for activation. Although activation generally requires initial binding of the ligand, mutation-induced receptor activation can be observed in many GPCRs. This mode of activation also involves movement of TM3 and TM6, suggesting that TM-helical movements may be similar among members of GPCR family. Smaller movements in the loop connecting TM1 to TM2, and in TM7, have been mapped in rhodopsin. By constructing an activating metal-ion site between TM3 and TM7, motion of these two helices is confirmed in the β2-adrenergic receptor. Only minor changes have been reported for TM4 and TM5. The established motion of TM3 and TM6 in more than three GPCRs, however, does not exclude that movement of other domains may not contribute to receptor activation. In recent fluorescence spectroscopic studies of the β2-adrenergic receptor, evidence for multiple sequential conformational changes was obtained (16Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), which is reminiscent of multiple intermediates involved in the photoactivation of rhodopsin. Sequential conformational changes in the activation process of GPCRs may involve general and specific movements of TM helices to distinct positions with characteristic time constraints (see Refs. 2Gether U. Endo. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar and 3Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar for detailed discussion). Given the fact that residues corresponding to Asp74 in TM2 and the 298NPLFY302 in TM7 of the AT1 receptor are highly conserved in the GPCR superfamily, the functional significance of TM2-TM7 interactions uncovered in this study may be common to many GPCRs. Interaction of TM2-TM7 has been postulated in the α-adrenergic receptor, gonadotrophin releasing hormone receptor, vasopressin receptor, oxytocin receptor, and endothelin receptor (11Marie J.

Whether the effects we report here on stabilization of agonist-bound receptor and prolongation of active state is a common phenotype in diverse GPCRs requires further study.

This tumor suppressor functions in the p53 and pRb cell cycle regulatory pathways and can effectively activate both pathways to induce growth arrest or cell death. We now report that p14ARF forms a complex with the E1A-regulated transcriptional repressor, p120E4F. p120E4F contacts p14ARF and p53 to form a ternary complex in vivo and enhances p14ARF-induced G2 cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner. We suggest that the interaction of p14ARF and p120E4F forms an important link between the p14ARF and p53 tumor suppressor proteins, both of which exhibit enhanced cell cycle inhibitory activity in the presence of this transcriptional repressor.

The INK4a/ARF locus on chromosome band 9p21 is disrupted in a wide variety of human tumors at a frequency comparable with p53 inactivation. The common loss of this locus presumably reflects its dual coding capacity; this single genomic sequence encodes the ARF tumor suppressor and the p16INK4acyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (1Serrano M.

The ARF tumor suppressor can induce potent growth arrest or cell death in response to hyperproliferative oncogenic stimuli.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). ARF limits the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Hdm2, thus preventing the polyubiquitination, nuclear export, and subsequent cytoplasmic degradation of p53 (22Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 23Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 24Weber J.D.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Consequently, the loss of ARF not only diminishes the response of the p53 network to hyperproliferative signals but also reduces the duration of p53 activity in response to DNA damaging stimuli. Animals lacking ARF are highly prone to tumor formation, and their embryonic fibroblasts do not senesce, continuing to cycle after DNA damage (26Khan S.H. Moritsugu J. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3266-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ARF can also inhibit cell growth through p53- and Hdm2-independent mechanisms. Various types of human tumors exhibit simultaneous loss of p53 and ARF (27Esteller M. Tortola S. Toyota M. Capella G. Peinado M.A. Baylin S.B. Herman J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sanchez-Cespedes M. Reed A.L. Buta M. Wu L. Westra W.H. Herman J.G. Yang S.C. Jen J. Sidransky D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5843-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the inactivation of p53 and ARF was not mutually exclusive in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (29Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Mice lacking both ARF and p53, with or without the mouse Hdm2 homologue, Mdm2, developed a wider range of tumor types than animals lacking either tumor suppressor alone (30Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of the murine ARF homologue, p19ARF, strongly suppressed colony formation of p53-null MEFs (29Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and inhibited DNA synthesis in p53-null/Mdm2-null MEFs (30Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although murine and human ARF display important differences in structure and function, human p14ARF also reduced the rate of DNA synthesis when p53 function was compromised (31Yarbrough W.G. Bessho M. Zanation A. Bisi J.E. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1171-1177PubMed Google Scholar). The p53/Hdm2-independent functions of ARF are poorly understood but presumably involve additional ARF-binding partners. ARF can interact and destabilize the S-phase-inducing transcription factors E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 (32Martelli F. Hamilton T. Silver D.P. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Rokas M. DePinho R.A.

Gazzeri S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for E2F degradation in the mechanism of ARF growth suppression, p53-null MEFs engineered to over-express E2F-1 were at least partially insensitive to the growth inhibitory action of p19ARF (29Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 32Martelli F. Hamilton T. Silver D.P. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Rokas M. DePinho R.A.

Although the extent to which these ARF complexes modulate the cell cycle inhibitory action of ARF is not well established, spinophilin and CARF appear to cooperate with ARF in promoting growth arrest, whereas pex19p retains p19ARF in the cytoplasm and down-regulates the p19ARF-p53 pathway (38Sugihara T.

We now report that p14ARF can associate in vitroand in vivo with the adenovirus E1A-regulated p120E4F transcription factor. In humans and mice, p120E4F is an ubiquitously expressed, low abundance GLI-Kruppel-related zinc finger phosphoprotein that acts as a transcriptional repressor of the adenovirus E4 gene and, presumably, other cellular target genes (40Fernandes E.R. Rooney R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rooney R.J. Rothammer K. Fernandes E.R.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2956-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In response to adenovirus E1A or treatment with phorbol ester, p120E4F becomes hyperphosphorylated and undergoes a reduction in both DNA binding and transcriptional repressor activities (43Fernandes E.R. Zhang J.Y. Rooney R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 44Fognani C. Della Valle G. Babiss L.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the properties of p50E4F, a proteolytically derived 50-kDa amino-terminal fragment of p120E4F that exhibits increased DNA binding activity in response to E1A-induced phosphorylation and stimulates the adenoviral E4 gene (40Fernandes E.R. Rooney R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although p50E4F and p120E4F can recognize the same DNA motif (RTGACGT(C/A)AY) in vitro, the additional residues specific to p120E4F confer distinct functional and regulatory properties. Expression of p120E4F significantly inhibits cellular growth and cell cycle progression, whereas p50E4Fhas no such effect (42Fajas L. Paul C. Vie A. Estrach S. Medema R. Blanchard J.M. Sardet C.

The growth inhibitory activity of p120E4F has been associated with the post-transcriptional elevation of several cell cycle regulatory proteins, including the CDK inhibitors p21Waf1 and p27Kip1, cyclin E, and cyclin B1, with reduced Cdk2, Cdk4/6, and Cdc2 kinase activities and with the down-regulation of cyclin A2 gene expression (42Fajas L.

Moreover, p120E4F-induced cell cycle arrest is enhanced by its interaction with the p53 transcription factor and hypophosphorylated pRb (46Sandy P. Gostissa M. Fogal V. Cecco L.D. Szalay K. Rooney R.J. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 47Fajas L. Paul C. Zugasti O. Le Cam L. Polanowska J. Fabbrizio E. Medema R. Vignais M.L. Sardet C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7738-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the cyclin A gene is the only cellular target thus far demonstrated to be down-regulated by p120E4F, it is likely that other genes involved in the control of cell cycle progression are regulated by p120E4F, as ectopic expression of p120E4F can induce cell cycle arrest at the G1-S and G2-M transitions even when cyclin A mRNA and protein levels are not reduced (43Fernandes E.R. Zhang J.Y. Rooney R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 48Rooney R.J. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 505-516PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that p14ARF forms a complex with p120E4F to modulate cell cycle progression. The formation of this complex occurs through residues in p120E4F that are in close proximity to those required for p53 binding and growth suppression activity and through residues in the amino-terminal region of p14ARF, which is also involved in Hdm2, E2F, and topoisomerase binding. Through this interaction, p14ARF sequesters ectopically expressed p120E4F in nucleoli. Importantly, p120E4Fcontacts both p14ARF and p53 to form a ternary complexin vivo and enhances G2 cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner. We propose that p14ARFco-operates with p53 to induce growth arrest by interacting with and regulating the activity of the E1A-regulated transcription factor, p120E4F. The p14 ARF-FLAG(49Rizos H.

TheE4F-(369–566)-displayTARGET andE4F-(567–784)-displayTARGET clones were each amplified from pCMVs-E4F2.5K with the following primers: E4F-(369–566) sense (5′-AGCGAATTCAACCTGCTGCACCAG-3′) and antisense (5′-CTTCTCGAGCTACACGTGCCGCACCAG-3′); E4F-(567–784) sense (5′-AGCGAATTCCGACACCACACAGGC-3′) and antisense (5′-CTTCTCGAGCTAGACGATGACCGT-3′). All inserts were amplified usingPfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and verified by automated sequencing. Human osteosarcoma U2OS (ARF-null, p53 and pRb wild type) and Saos-2 (ARF wild type, pRb-null and p53-null) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Trace Scientific, Sydney, Australia) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and glutamine. All cells were cultured in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. For immunofluorescence studies, cultured cells (1 × 105) were seeded on coverslips in six-well plates and transfected with 1–3 μg of purified plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). For cell cycle distribution analysis, cultured cells (2.5–3 × 105) were seeded in T25 flasks and co-transfected with the expression plasmids (3–3.5 μg) andpCMVEGFP-spectrin (1 μg). U2OS cells (1 × 105) seeded in triplicate in six-well plates were transfected with a total of 1.6 μg of DNA:500 ng of each expression plasmid and 100 ng of pEGFP-N1(Clontech) as a measure of transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and the percentage of GFP-positive cells (less than 10% variation among all transfections) was determined using FACS analysis. The remaining cells were expanded to a 10-cm2 plate and maintained in medium containing 300 μg of hygromycin/ml for 15 days, with antibiotic-containing-media refreshed every 4 days. Colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in phosphate-buffered saline, and colonies equal to or larger than 2 mm were scored visually. Full-length p14ARF cDNA was fused in-frame with the yeast LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA-DBD) in thedisplayBAIT vector (Display Systems Biotech) to create the hybrid bait protein. A randomly primed human fetal brain cDNA library constructed in the displayTARGET vector was obtained from Display Systems Biotech. The displayTARGET vector encodes proteins fused to the B42-activation domain (B42-AD) and the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. BAIT and TARGETplasmids were co-transformed into Yeast-H yeast cells (Display Biosystems Biotech) as detailed in the Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid protocol (Clontech). Colonies with plasmid DNA encoding target proteins, which interact with the bait protein, were identified by transcription of the LEU2 reporter gene integrated into the yeast genome and the green fluorescence protein encoded by the co-transformed displayREPORTER vector. Plasmid DNA was rescued from positive colonies, introduced intoEscherichia coli KC8 (Clontech) and partially sequenced to characterize the target DNA. Yeast cells were transformed sequentially with a LexA-DBD-p14 ARF construct, aB42-AD-p120 E4F construct, and the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, pSH18–34(Clontech). Transformants were grown on dextrose− ura− his− trp− plates, and five colonies for each transformant type were picked and grown overnight in dextrose− ura− his− trp− liquid medium. β-Galactosidase activity was determined using the Pierce yeast β-galactosidase kit. Approximately 40 h after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were immunostained for 50 min with either monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or rabbit anti-E4F-Nterm (40Fernandes E.R. Rooney R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a 50-min exposure to either anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Molecular Probes) or a Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Subcellular distribution of E4F was determined from a total of at least 250 fluorescent cells from two independent transfection experiments unless otherwise indicated. The standard deviation obtained within transfection experiments was always less than ±5%. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with propidium iodide (50 ng/μl) containing ribonuclease A (50 ng/μl). EGFP-spectrin was used as a marker for analysis of transfected cells. DNA content from at least 2000 EGFP-spectrin-positive cells was analyzed using ModFIT software. The percentage of S-phase inhibition was calculated as described previously (46Sandy P. Gostissa M. Fogal V. Cecco L.D. Szalay K. Rooney R.J. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression of endogenous and ectopically expressed proteins was determined 24–40 h after transfecting U2OS cells with the indicated expression plasmids. Proteins were extracted for 20 min at 4 °C using RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The protein concentration was determined with the Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Western blots were probed with antibodies against p53 (D0–1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21Waf1 (C-19, Santa Cruz), cyclin A (C-19, Santa Cruz), CDK4 (DCS-35, NeoMarkers), FLAG (M2, Sigma), and E4F-Nterm (40Fernandes E.R. Rooney R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation analysis, 1 × 106 cells were transfected with 4–6 μg of expression plasmid and 500 ng ofpEGFP-N1 (Clontech) as a measure of transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and the percentage of GFP-positive cells (∼40% of the total cell population) was determined using FACS analysis. Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at 4 °C and precleared using 1 μg of normal IgG for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal E4F antibody and 50 μl protein A-agarose in a total volume of 1.5 ml. Immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, resolved using SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblot analysis. For immunoprecipitations using M450-tosylactivated DYNALbeads (DYNAL), 2 μg of antibody was adsorbed chemically as described by the manufacturer. Cell lysates were not precleared, and immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for 90 min. Immunoprecipitation washes and protein detection were carried out as described above. Yeast proteins were extracted as described in the manufacturer's yeast protocols handbook (Clontech). Electrophoresis was performed on SDS polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Bio-Rad). Western immunoblotting of proteins tagged with the LexA DNA-binding domain or the HA epitope was carried out using the monoclonal mouse anti-LexA antibody (2-12, Santa Cruz) and monoclonal anti-HA antibody (F-7, Santa Cruz), respectively. The yeast two-hybrid assay was employed to identify proteins capable of interacting with the p14ARF tumor suppressor. Full-length p14ARF fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain was used as bait to screen a human fetal brain cDNA expression library fused to the B42 activation domain (Display Systems Biotech). Sequence analysis of the 30 positive clones revealed that a single clone corresponded to the carboxyl-terminal half (amino acids 369–784) of the E1A-regulated transcription factor, p120E4F. This region is specific to full-length p120E4F and contains a central zinc finger domain with residues that are involved in the contact of p120E4F with p53 and pRb (46Sandy P. Gostissa M. Fogal V.

Medema R. Vignais M.L. Sardet C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7738-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To verify that E4F interacts with p14ARF in vivo, the full-length p120E4F cDNA cloned in pCMV5 (40Fernandes E.R. Rooney R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was overexpressed transiently in human Saos-2 cells with either FLAG-tagged p14ARF or FLAG-tagged p16INK4a. Approximately 24 h post-transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-E4F polyclonal antibody and blotted with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, p14ARF-FLAG and p120E4F were efficiently co-precipitated, indicating that these two proteins are capable of interacting in vivo. p120E4F was also co-precipitated with p14ARF-FLAG using anti-FLAG or anti-ARF monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). The control immunoprecipitations performed with p16INK4a-FLAG-transfected cells were negative. p14ARF interacts with Hdm2, topoisomerase I, and the E2F transcription factors via its amino-terminal half (amino acids 1–64). This region also contains an arginine-rich nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS), which forms part of the Hdm2-binding domain (Fig. 2) (24Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L.

Not surprisingly these amino-terminal 64 amino acids are necessary for the growth inhibitory activity of p14ARF. The carboxyl terminus of p14ARF (amino acids 65–132) is not well conserved but is required for full p14ARF activity; this region also contains an arginine-rich nucleolar localization sequence, a fragment that was shown to interact weakly with Hdm2 using surface plasmon resonance (52Bothner B. Lewis W.S. DiGiammarino E.L. Weber J.D. Bothner S.J. Kriwacki R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To define the region of p14ARF that associates with p120E4F, we generated deletion constructs of p14ARF fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain and quantitatively assayed their ability to interact in yeast with full-length p120E4F fused to the B42 activation domain. The amino-terminal half of p14ARF was found to interact with p120E4F, whereas no E4F binding was detected with the carboxyl-terminal p14ARF fragment (Fig. 2). Partial deletion of the amino-termina"

The sequence between −746 and −707 inmor distal promoter was used as the bait because it acts as a functional promoter element and binds several DNA-binding proteins. From an adult mouse brain cDNA library, five cDNA clones encoding three Sox gene family (Sry like high mobility group (HMG) box gene) transcriptional factors, mSOX18, mSOX21, and mSOX6, were isolated. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of a binding site for SOX proteins in the −731/−725 region. Additionally, we have also established that the flanking regions outside the core Sox-binding site play an essential role in high affinity binding. DNase I footprint analysis indicates that proteins from mouse brain interact with the Sox-binding site within the mor distal promoter. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of mSOX18 and/or mSOX21 was able to up-regulate mouse mor distal promoter activity inmor-expressing neuronal cells (NMB). These data indicate that SOX proteins might contribute to the transcriptional activity of the mor gene and suggest that μ opioid receptor could mediate some of the developmental processes in which SOX proteins are included.

Pharmacological, physiological, receptor binding, and molecular cloning studies (1Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 607-624PubMed Google Scholar) have revealed that opioids interact with three major types of opioid receptors in the mammalian central nervous system and peripheral tissues, μ, δ, and κ. All three types of receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (2Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and the μ opioid receptor (mor)1 is known to play the essential role in morphine-induced analgesia, tolerance, and dependence as indicated from pharmacological studies. This has also been confirmed by additional in vivo pharmacological analyses of mice where mor was deleted by homologous recombination (3Loh H.H. Liu H.C. Cavalli A. Yang W. Chen Y.F. Wei L.N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Mor is expressed mainly in the central nervous system, where it exhibits distinct temporal and spatial patterns of distribution (1Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 607-624PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, in situ hybridization studies and other methods (e.g. RPA (RNase protection assay) and reverse transcriptase-PCR) indicate that expression of mor mRNA is regulated at the transcriptional level, especially during embryonic development (4Zhu Y. Hsu M.S. Pintar J.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2538-2549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tong Y. Chabot J.G. Shen S.H. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Quirion R. J. Chem.

Lett. 1999; 261: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation are not completely understood, but analysis of the 5′-upstream sequences from the translation initiation sites of the morgene has shown that expression of mor is driven by two promoters, a distal and a proximal promoter (8Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Both promoters exhibit characteristics of housekeeping genes lacking a TATA box (9Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the proximal promoter regulating mor transcription from four major initiation sites located in a region 291–268 bp upstream of the translation initiation site. The distal promoter initiatesmor transcription from a single transcription initiation site located 794 bp upstream of the translation initiation site (8Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and is known to be 20-fold less active than the proximal promoter, based on quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using adult mouse brain mRNA (9Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, in adult mouse, the proximal promoter confers the largest part of the cell and tissue-specific expression of mor (9Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is also important to note that the 34-bp cis-acting element positioned between −721 and −687 possesses a strong inhibitory effect against the distal promoter transcriptional function (11Choe C., Im, H.J., Ko, J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34926-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because the exact role of the distal promoter in morexpression is largely unknown, our objective in the present study was to identify cis-acting DNA elements and theirtrans-acting factors that are associated with transcription from the mouse mor distal promoter. Secondly, we sought to determine the possible role of the distal promoter in regulatingmor expression. The results demonstrate the ability of the cis-acting element to augment the mor distal promoter activity in co-transfection analysis using deletional promoter constructs. Three kinds of Sox genes were isolated using the yeast one-hybrid system, which helped to identify the trans-acting factors that bind to the positive cis-acting element of the mordistal promoter. The Sox proteins belong to the high mobility group (HMG) box superfamily of DNA-binding proteins and are found throughout the animal kingdom (12Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These proteins are involved in the regulation of such diverse developmental processes as germ layer formation, organ development, and cell-type specification. Hence, deletion or mutation of Sox proteins often results in developmental defects and congenital disease in humans. Sox proteins perform their function in a complex interplay with other transcription factors in a manner highly dependent on cell type and promoter context. They exhibit remarkable cross-talk and functional redundancy among each other (12Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 13Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Therefore, Sox proteins may play an important role in regulating the expression of themor gene, temporally, spatially, and developmentally as well as gender-dependently in brain. In this report, we characterized the nature and function of these nuclear proteins, which regulate the expression of μ opioid receptor gene. The MATCHMAKER One-Hybrid System (Clontech) was used according to the supplier's protocol. Four tandem repeats of the −745 to −706-bp sequence (the positive regulatory element) of the mouse mor distal promoter were ligated into the SacI-XbaI sites of pHISi and EcoRI-SalI sites of pLacZi to generate pHISi-4x40 and pLacZi-4x40, respectively (40 denotes the sequence between −745 and −706). These two bait constructs were then linearized with XhoI and NcoI, respectively, and integrated into the genome of yeast strain YM4271. The resultant yeast cells with the integrated pHISi-4x40 were tested for growth on minimal medium lacking histidine (His−) in the presence of increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Background growth was inhibited in the presence of 30 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and this concentration was then used when yeast cells were transformed with a mouse brain cDNA library for one-hybrid screening. Five positive transformants grown on His− plates were selected. To exclude false positive clones, plasmids recovered from these five clones were used to transform yeast cells harboring the pLacZi-4x40 construct. Positive transformants grown on His- and leucine-negative (Leu−) medium containing 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole were streaked onto a nylon filter and incubated by placing the filter on the same medium at 30 °C for 2 days. The filter was then soaked in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and placed on a Whatman No. 3MM filter that had been presoaked in Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 60 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) containing 0.01% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Plasmids from 10 positive blue clones were sequenced, and their homology was analyzed using the BLAST algorithm. Constructs for the recombinant luciferase reporter gene plasmids pL1.3K/687, pL1.3K/775, pL1.3K/728, pL1.3K/721, and pL1.3K/717 have been previously described (11Choe C., Im, H.J., Ko, J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34926-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further define the positive regulatory region of themor distal promoter, pL1.3K/747, pL1.3K/738, pL1.3K/731, and pL1.3K/725 were generated from pL1.3K/687 by PCR with the primers shown in Fig. 1; that is, forward (mor5′), 5′-GTCTGTGAGAATTCAGTTAAACTTCTACAACC-3′ (EcoR1 site at nucleotide −1326 is underlined) and all the corresponding reverse primers bearing essential Kozak sequences (5′-CCATGGTG-3′) and NcoI site (located at start codon of luciferase). The resulting fragments were substituted into theBfrI (−1105)-NcoI fragment of the pL1.3K/444 plasmid (11Choe C., Im, H.J., Ko, J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34926-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mutant reporter plasmids pL1.3K/721m2 and pL1.3K/721m123 were constructed by PCR using pL1.3K/687 as the template the same forward primer, mor5′, as described above and reverse primer, 5′-GGGCCATGGCTGTTGTCGACAACAATTGTCTTTTTCTAA-3′, for pL1.3K/721m2 and 5′-GGGCCATGG AGTACATCGATTCTGATTGTCTTTTTCTAAAAGAGAAAA-3′ for pL1.3K/721m123 (the NcoI site is underlined, the start codon is italicized, and mutated sites are in bold). The PCR products were inserted into a TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and subsequently subcloned into the BfrI-NcoI sites of pL1.3K/721. The mammalian expression plasmids, pc1-Sox18 or pc1-Sox6, were constructed by inserting theEcoRI-XhoI fragment of the original library clones, pACT2-Sox18 or pACT2-Sox6, into the same sites of pcDNA1.1/amp (Invitrogen), respectively. To construct pc1-Sox21, the BamHI-XhoI fragment of the original clone was inserted into the same sites of pcDNA1.1/amp. The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. In vitro translation was carried out with pc1-Sox18, pc1-Sox21, and pc1-Sox6 in a reaction mixture containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using a TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The labeled proteins were then electrophoresed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and their sizes were compared with the predicted sizes. Human neuroblastoma NMB cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/well and cultured overnight before transfection. Various plasmids at concentrations indicated in each figure were used with the SuperFect Transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, for 3′ deletional analysis of the distal promoter, 2 μg of the reporter plasmids were mixed with SuperFect Transfection reagent for 15 min before being added to NMB cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells grown to confluence were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, a one-fifth molar ratio of a pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) containing the β-galactosidase gene under the SV40 promoter was included in each transfection for normalization. The luciferase and galactosidase activities of each lysate were determined as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Tropix, respectively). For co-transfection assays, the procedures were the same as above, except the plasmids were a mixture of the given amount of pc1-Sox18 or pc1-Sox21 and 1 μg of a corresponding reporter plasmid, pL1.3K/721 or pL1.3K/721m123. Nuclear extract from NMB cells was prepared using a modification of procedures of Dignam et al.(14Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar) and Hennighausen et al. (15Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The upper and lower strands of each probe were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotides were then end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The end-labeled DNA probes were incubated with NMB nuclear extract or 8 μl of in vitro translated products in a final volume of 20 μl of EMSA buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature for 30 min. For oligonucleotide competition analysis, a 25–100-fold molar excess of cold competitor oligonucleotide was added to the mixture before adding the probe. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The mor distal promoter region from −812 to −575 bp was generated by PCR using a32P-labeled primer for the coding strand and using pL1.3K/508 (11Choe C., Im, H.J., Ko, J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34926-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as template to create the 5′-labeled 236-bp probe. PCR primers used to prepare the probe for footprinting were: sense, 5′-GAGAAATTGAAGGAGTGGGGGCACA-3′ (bases −812 to −788) and antisense, 5′-ATACCTCAACACTCTTCCGACTCA-3′ (bases −575 to −557). All the oligonucleotides and probes were purified by PAGE. DNase I footprinting was performed according to the recommended manual using the Core Footprinting System (Promega). Nuclear extract from mouse brain was prepared according to the method described by Sonnenberg et al. (16Sonnenberg J.L. Macgregor-Leon P.F. Curran T. Morgan J.I. Neuron. 1989; 3: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out for 20 min on ice in a final volume of 50 μl. The binding solutions contained 100 fmol of labeled probe and the indicated amounts of the mouse brain nuclear extract in a final buffer concentration of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After incubation, MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to final concentrations of 5 and 2.5 mm, respectively, then 0.3 unit of DNase I (Promega) was added. The incubation was continued for 4 min at room temperature. The digestion was stopped by using 90 μl of stop solution containing 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.2 m NaCl, and 250 μg/ml tRNA. DNA was extracted by using phenol-chloroform (1:1) and ethanol precipitation before loading onto a 6% sequencing polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. Our previous results have shown that the 5′-flanking region of the mouse μ opioid receptor (mor) gene has two major promoters, designated as the proximal and distal (9Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Choeet al. (11Choe C., Im, H.J., Ko, J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34926-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) from our laboratory have also reported a positive cis-acting element between the nucleotides −721 and −775 and a negative cis-acting element between the nucleotides −687 and −721. Both of these regulatory elements are present within the 5′-distal promoter regulatory sequences ofmor promoter. To define the exact position of the positivecis-acting element, a further detailed 3′-deletional mutagenesis was performed in the region of −775 to −721 (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, a deletion of just 4 bp from the 3′ end (pL1.3K/725) exhibited a 50% decrease in luciferase activity relative to the pL1.3K/721 construct. A further deletion to −731 resulted in an additional 25% decrease in promoter activity. These results indicate that the deleted segment of −730 to −721 is important for the positive cis-acting element. Further deletions resulted in a slight increase in promoter activity, indicating the complexity of regulation of distal promoter activity. To determine whether this positive cis-acting element of −730 to −721 could recruit transcription factors to regulate the promoter activity, we next performed EMSAs using nuclear extracts frommor-expressing NMB cells. We selected the segments O1 (−746 to −707) and O2 (−741 to −718) (Fig. 2 A) as probes, because they both covered the region of −730 to −721 but with different lengths of their flanking sequences. As shown in Fig. 2, there are several protein-DNA complexes formed with the probe O1 and O2. The higher molecular weight complexes were efficiently inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of cold self-competitors, indicating these complexes were sequence-specific, whereas the fastest running band with the O2 probe was not abrogated with self-competitor (Fig. 2 C), indicating the presence of nonspecific interaction. In summary, the O1 and O2 sequences, containing the positive cis-acting element, can form sequence-specific DNA-protein complexes with NMB nuclear extracts, suggesting the presence of endogenous transcription factors. Based on the EMSA and luciferase reporter assay results, we hypothesize that the positive cis-acting element plays a role in regulating distal mor promoter activity. The SOX family consists of a group of transcription factors that recognize a specific common SOX protein binding site (5′-WWCAAWG-3′, where W = A or T) (17Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). These factors are thought to bind to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA and induce DNA bending, resulting in chromatin structure favorable to regulation of promoter transcription (18Uchikawa M. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Analysis of the O1 cis-acting element revealed at least four putative Sox-binding sites within this short DNA sequence, as indicated in Fig. 3. To further characterize Sox binding to O1, EMSAs were carried out using O1 as probe and a consensus Sox binding sequence, 5′-GATCCGCGCCTTTGTTCTCCCCA-3′ (SSC, as shown in Fig. 3 B) (19Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a competitor. Efficient competition was observed with a 40-fold excess of the SOX consensus competitor and maximal competition with a 100-fold excess of the competitor, confirming the probe's SOX factor binding property. The O1 cis-acting element contains four putative Sox-binding sites in very close proximity to each other. Similar multiple Sox-binding sites have also been previously reported from several other genes (20Callard G.V. Tchoudakova A.V. Kishida M. Wood E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 79: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Peirano R.I. Goerich D.E. Riethmacher D. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3198-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To define exactly which of these Sox-binding sites is essential to the promoter activity, five additional oligonucleotides spanning the entire region were synthesized. They were designated as O3 to O7, as indicated in Fig. 3 A. These fragments were then tested for their ability to compete with the DNA-protein complexes from the O1 element. The DNA-protein complexes were abolished by a 100-fold excess of competitors O2, O3, and O7 but not by O4, O5, and O6. These data suggest that the double-stranded DNA sequence shared by O2, O3, and O7 is probably important for binding of NMB nuclear extracts to the O1 cis-acting elements. Examination of this common sequence revealed a putative Sox-binding site, 5′-CTTTGAA-3′, asunderlined and in bold in Fig. 3 A. Furthermore, this putative Sox-binding site is located downstream of the distal promoter rather than upstream, as reported for other systems (18Uchikawa M. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 22Nikolaev I. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9795-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, its orientation to the distal promoter is also reversed. However, O6, which failed to block the formation of O1-protein complexes, also contains this entire sequence. This observation might be explained by a requirement of an additional two nucleotides at the 5′-flanking region of SOX core-binding site for the formation of the DNA-protein complex. To obtain further insight into complex formation, we performed EMSAs using unlabeled mutant oligonucleotides to compete with32P-labeled O2 for the complex formation with NMB nuclear extracts. We designed four mutated oligos; M7 and M8 have a mutation in each side of the Sox-binding consensus site, the 5′ flanking region was mutated in M6, and the 3′-flanking region was mutated in M9 (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the probe O2 containing the complete Sox-binding site and both 5′- and 3′-flanking regions has formed DNA-protein complex bands in the presence of NMB nuclear extracts. The M6 competitor effectively blocked the appearance of the major migrating bands, but M9 did not affect the bands. In general, both flanking regions of the core consensus-binding site are required for protein binding in many transcription factors (22Nikolaev I. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9795-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Gould K.A. Bresnick E.H. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 87-101PubMed Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that the specific sequence of four bases in the flanking region downstream of the core is required for high affinity binding (lane 7 in Fig. 4 B). In addition, the presence of at least two bases without sequence specificity at the upstream flanking region is required for the DNA-protein complex formation (lanes 7 and8 in Fig. 3 C and lane 4 in Fig. 4 B). As expected, the competitor M7 with the mutated 5′-core-binding site, could not abrogate the DNA-protein complex. However, M8 with the mutated 3′-core-binding site could compete partially but not as strongly as M6 and the self-competitor O2, indicating that the 5′-core-binding site is more important than the 3′-core-binding site for high affinity binding. The DNA-complexes were not inhibited by nonspecific competitors, Sp1 (24Hwang C.K. D'Souza U.M. Eisch A.J. Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Yang Y. Lee S.H. Kim Y.M. Nestler E.J. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7558-7563Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Ikaros (25Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) consensus sequences, confirming the specificity of the DNA-protein interaction (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these results suggest that NMB nuclear extracts contain proteins that bind sequence-specifically to the identified Sox binding motif of themor distal promoter. The relationship between in vivo positive modulatory activity and in vitro DNA-protein interaction(s) was initially assessed by DNase I footprinting using a probe extending between nucleotides −812 and −575. As shown in Fig. 5, at a very high concentration of nuclear extract from mouse brain (80 μg), characteristic DNase I-hypersensitive sites below nucleotides −739 and above −725 and a protected region (−739 to −725) against DNase I digestion were observed. In contrast, relatively lower concentrations of the nuclear extracts (20 or 40 μg) hardly altered the DNase I digestion pattern of the probe (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 3 withlane 4). This may be the reason why we did not observe the DNA-complex formation from mouse brain in EMSA, suggesting very low abundance of the endogenous transcription factor(s) that bind to this area in adult mouse brain. To identify transcription factors that bind to the positive element of the distal promoter, we utilized the yeast one-hybrid system to screen an adult mouse brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech). The O1 sequence was used as bait because it contained more of the flanking regions potentially important for the transcription factor binding affinity. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing four tandem repeats of the O1 sequence was subcloned into pHISi. The resulting plasmid, pHISi-4x40 was integrated into the yeast YM4271 genome. Using this yeast strain, 3 × 106 independent colonies from the library were screened. A total of five independent, histidine-positive clones were selected and sequenced. The results revealed that all five clones belonged to the SOX family of transcription factors. Two of the clones contained full-length sequences (2.7 kilobase pairs) encoding polypeptides with more than 80% sequence identity to human Sox21. These clones were designated mSox21 (GenBankTM accession number AY142959). The other two clones were identical to mSox18 and also contained full-length cDNA sequences, whereas the fifth clone proved to be a truncated form of mSox6 lacking the first 299 amino acids but encoding a DNA binding domain. To verify that the three cloned SOX proteins bind to the O1-containing promoter in vivo, the three independent cDNA clones were transformed into yeast strains containing the control plasmid pHISi. All three SOX proteins could specifically activate the HIS3 gene containing the four tandem repeats of the O1 element but not the HIS3 gene lacking these repeats. This suggests that the cloned SOX proteins bind specifically to this O1 cis-acting element and not to the sequence of the HIS minimal promoter. To exclude the possibility that the addition of the O1 element may form some specific sequences with the minimal HIS3 promoter that favor binding of the SOX protein, we used another reporter yeast strain containing pLacZi-4x40. A control yeast strain without repeats of the cis-acting elements but with pLacZi integrated into its genome was also used. The cloned SOX plasmids were transformed separately into these yeast strains. All three SOX clones in yeast strains containing pLacZi-4x40 were found to be true positives after the LacZ expression test. In control yeast strains containing pLacZi transformed with SOX plasmids, there was no activation, indicating that these three cloned SOX proteins indeed have specific strong binding activity to the four tandem repeats of the O1cis-acting elements in vivo. The ability of all three Sox cDNAs (Sox6, Sox18, and Sox21) to encode proteins was verified by in vitro translation, and the products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. All the in vitro translated SOX proteins were electrophoresed and found to be the correct size, as expected from their calculated molecular weights (data not shown). To confirm whether the isolated SOX proteins can indeed bind to the positivecis-acting element, EMSAs were carried out using in vitro translated SOX protein products. The SOX proteins were able to shift the target O2 oligonucleotide probe. The specificity of this DNA-protein interaction was verified by complete inhibition in the presence of cold wild-type O2 oligonucleotide in an"

The primary function of this enzyme is the degradation of hyaluronan, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the tissues of vertebrates and of some bacteria. The enzyme degrades its substrate through a β-elimination process called proton acceptance and donation. The inherent part of this degradation is a processive mode of action of the enzyme degrading hyaluronan into unsaturated disaccharide hyaluronic acid blocks from the reducing to the nonreducing end of the polymer following the initial random endolytic binding to the substrate. The final degradation product is the unsaturated disaccharide hyaluronic acid. The residues of the enzyme that are involved in various aspects of such degradation were identified based on the three-dimensional structures of the native enzyme and its complexes with hyaluronan substrates of various lengths. The catalytic residues were identified to be Asn349, His399, and Tyr408. The residues responsible for the release of the product of the reaction were identified as Glu388, Asp398, and Thr400, and they were termed negative patch.

It is a polymeric substance built from a repeating disaccharide units of hyaluronic acid with the chemical formula [→4)GlcUA(β1→3)GlcNAc(β1→]n(Fig. 1) (1Laurent T.C. Balazs E.A. Chemistry and Molecular Biology of Intercellular Matrix 2. Academic Press, London1970: 703-732Google Scholar). Hyaluronan isolated from natural sources has an enormous size, up to 25,000 disaccharide units or 107 Da. The polymer interacts with water to create a strikingly viscoelastic solution. These unique mechanical properties are utilized in, for example, joints as a shock absorber (2Winter W.T. Arnott S. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 761-784Google Scholar). In addition to the mechanical properties, hyaluronan synthesis and degradation is finely regulated to allow initiation of other biochemical processes. For example, hyaluronan is involved in multiple signal transduction processes (3Fraser J.R.E. Laurent T.C. Evered D. Whelan J. Turnover and Metabolism of Hyaluronan. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1989: 42-59Google Scholar, 4Comper W.D. Laurent T.C. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 255-308Google Scholar), often utilizing other macromolecules for interactions such as CD44 or RHAM (5Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Google Scholar, 6Laurent T.C. Fraser R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar). Through these molecules or these transduction processes, HA influences many essential processes, for example, cell migration and development. Exogenous elements, such as bacteria including members of theStreptococcus species, degrade the hyaluronan of its host organism, including humans, through the action of hyaluronate lyase enzymes by the process of β-elimination (7Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Google Scholar, 8Boulnois G.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 249-259Google Scholar, 9Linker A. Meyer K. Hoffman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 13-25Google Scholar). In contrast, the endogenous degradation of hyaluronan is performed by the hyaluronidase enzymes of the host that utilize a mechanistically distinct hydrolysis mechanism (7Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism of the lyase action was largely unknown until relatively recently when the first structural information on bacterial hyaluronate lyase enzymes was obtained by means of x-ray crystallography (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar). Similar structural information for the endogenous hyaluronidases is not available at present except for that of the homologous bee venom enzyme (11Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Schirmer T. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Google Scholar). Therefore, the details of this process are still unclear and are based on comparison with other hydrolytic polysaccharide degrading enzymes. Hyaluronate lyase from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive human pathogen (12Musher D.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1991; 14: 801-807Google Scholar, 13Mufson M.A. Mandell G.L.

Immun. 1994; 62: 1101-1108Google Scholar). The availability of large quantities of the protein led to extensive biochemical and biophysical characterization of the enzyme together with its crystallization (17Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 71-73Google Scholar) and three-dimensional crystal structure determination (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar). Structure determination of the native form of the enzyme was followed by molecular modeling and characterization of crystal-based structures of enzyme-substrate complexes using di-, tetra-, and hexasaccharide units of hyaluronan (18Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Google Scholar, 19Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28287-28297Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Finally, a crystal structure of hyaluronate lyase from anotherStreptococcus species, Streptococcus agalactiae, was also elucidated in its native and complex forms with the disaccharide unit of HA degradation (20Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Google Scholar, 21Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 460-463Google Scholar). The three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of hyaluronate lyases show the enzyme as a globular protein built from at least two distinct domains: a helical α-domain and a β-sheet β-domain (Fig. 2). The α-domain is traversed by an elongated deep cleft where the HA substrate binds and where it is degraded to disaccharides. The comparison of both structure groups, from S. pneumoniaeand S. agalactiae, allowed for additional conclusions and generalization of the proposed mechanism of action of the lyase (22Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Google Scholar,23Kelly S.J. Taylor K.B., Li, S. Jedrzejas M.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 297-304Google Scholar). The catalytic residues (Asn349, His399, and Tyr408), as well as the residues of the hydrophobic (Trp291, Trp292, and Phe343) and the negative (Glu388, Asp398, and Thr400) patches that were implicated in the activity of the lyase were clearly identified and analyzed based on approaches similar to those used in the structural studies described above (see Fig. 3) (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar, 19Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol.

These studies include the structures of the nativeS. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae hyaluronate lyase, the structures of complexes with the substrates or products (disaccharide product of degradation, tetra- and hexasaccharide hyaluronan units), and site-directed mutation studies used in conjunction with kinetic studies of the corresponding mutant enzyme forms (22Jedrzejas M.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 221-251Google Scholar, 24Jedrzejas M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 187-207Google Scholar). The enzymes with mutated catalytic residues Asn349, His399, and Tyr408 were generated and isolated previously, and their enzymatic properties, including specific activities along with kinetic parameters, were determined and analyzed as described (23Kelly S.J. Taylor K.B., Li, S. Jedrzejas M.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 297-304Google Scholar). The correlation between the activity of the mutant enzymes, kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes, and their structures clearly confirmed the Asn349, His399, and Tyr408 residues as being directly involved in the catalysis. A detailed catalytic mechanism of β-elimination based degradation of HA, termed proton acceptance and donation (PAD), was proposed (see Figs. 3 and 4). The proposed mechanism involves five distinctive steps: (i) binding to the negatively charged hyaluronan substrate to the enzyme binding cleft with precise positioning of the substrate being directed by the hydrophobic patch consisting of residues Trp291, Trp292, and Phe343; (ii) catalysis involving primarily the catalytic residues Asn349, His399, and Tyr408with the resulting cleavage of the glycosidic β1,4 bond and generation of the disaccharide product; (iii) proton (hydrogen) exchange between the corresponding His399 and Tyr408 residues with the water microenvironment, a step that readies the enzyme for the next round of catalysis; (iv) release of the disaccharide product utilizing the negative patch composed of the Glu388, Asp398, and Thr400residues; and finally (v) translocation of the remaining polymeric hyaluronan substrate by 1 disaccharide unit toward the reducing end of the substrate (see Figs. 3 and 4) (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar, 19Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol.

Here we report further analysis of the properties of this enzyme by mutating the residues of the hydrophobic patch and providing the analysis of their role and importance in catalysis. Additional insights into this catalytic mechanism are supplied by the investigations of the specific activities and the kinetic properties of the wild type and mutant forms of this lyase. Hyaluronan used in this study was from human umbilical cord (Sigma; sodium salt, Lot 11K1517). All other chemicals were purchased from either Fisher or Sigma. Plasmid DNA preparations were obtained using the QIAprep kit from Qiagen, Inc. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit and procedure of Stratagene. The template for the single mutations, W292A and F343V, was plasmid pET-SpHyal-His6, pMJJ004 (15Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Google Scholar), containing a truncated but active S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (Ala168–Glu891 of the mature enzyme). Multiple mutations were made progressively by performing mutagenesis using templates and primers with the desired combination of mutations. Mutants were identified by automated DNA sequence analysis. The following primers, with the desired changes indicated in bold italic type, were used in the mutagenesis procedures (+ and − denote the upstream and the downstream primers, respectively): W291A+, GAGCATTGTTGGGAACGCTGCA GATTATGAAATCGG; W291A−, CCGATTTCATAATCTGCAGC GTTCCCAACAATGCTC; W292A+, CATTGTTGGGAACTGGGCA GATTATGAAATCGGTACAC; W292A−, GTGTACCGATTTCATAATCTGC CCAGTTCCCAACAATG; F343V+, GACGACTGATAACCCAGTA AAGGCTCTAGGTGGAAAC; and F343V−, GTTTCCACCTAGAGCCTTTAC TGGGTTATCAGTCGTC. The resultant clones were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells using standard procedures (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The recombinant wild typeS. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase enzyme from E. coli was overexpressed and purified as previously described (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J.

The mutant forms of the enzyme: (i) single mutants W292A and F343V; (ii) double mutants W291A/W292A and W292A/F343V; and (iii) one triple mutant W291A/W292A/F343V used in this study were overexpressed and purified in the same fashion as the wild type enzyme. The wild type and the mutant enzymes were stored in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer at 5 mg/ml protein concentration for further use. The activity unit for the enzyme was defined as the molar amount of the enzyme that produces 1 μm product/min (15Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Google Scholar). The presence of the mutations in the produced proteins was additionally identified (in addition to DNA sequence-based analysis) by mass spectrometry experiments as described under “Other Methods.” During the process of enzyme-catalyzed degradation of polymeric hyaluronan, a double bond in the glucuronic moiety is introduced between carbon atoms C-4 and C-5. This bond formation in the product of HA degradation induces a spectral shift with the absorption maximum at ∼232 nm. This absorption was followed experimentally to detect changes in the progress of the reaction for the wild type and the mutant enzymes. The HA degradation reaction was carried out in quartz cuvettes containing 300 μl of a reaction buffer with the HA substrate. The reaction buffer was 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm CaCl2 at pH 6.0. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of enzyme in the same buffer to the mixture of buffer and the specified amounts of the substrate. The amounts of the enzyme in the reaction mixture were modified as needed because of different abilities to degrade HA, and they were as follows: wild type, 10 ng; F343V, 33 ng; W292A, 500 ng; and W292A/F343V, 4800 ng. The measurement was initiated exactly 15 s after the enzyme was added to the reaction mixture. The progress of the reaction of HA degradation was followed by detecting the absorbance at 232 nm. The spectral measurements were performed using the BioSpec-1601PC UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) equipped with a thermoelectrically temperature controlled cell holder to perform the reaction when temperatures were raised above room temperature. The limits for the detection of the specific activity were directly related to the sensitivity of the spectrophotometer used, which was the absorbance at 232 nm of 0.001 or specific activity of 0.01 unit/min. Enzymes with smaller activity were considered inactive. All of the materials used in this study were preincubated at 37 °C using a water bath, and all of the subsequent procedures were also performed at this temperature. Concentration determinations used a molar absorption coefficient for the product of HA degradation of 5.5 × 103liter/mol−1 cm−1 as described (15Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Google Scholar, 26Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Google Scholar). For the specific activity measurements, the enzyme was added to a cuvette containing 300 μl of a 0.2 mg/ml of polymeric HA in the reaction buffer. To investigate the influence of the hydrophobic effectversus hydrogen bonding on activity, the specific activity measurements were also performed with the addition of 150 mm NaCl in the reaction buffer. The product absorbance was measured every 15 s for 6 min. The specific activity was calculated using UV-1601 PC Kinetics software (Shimadzu) and previously reported methodologies (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar, 15Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Google Scholar). For the initial velocity measurements the polymeric hyaluronan substrate concentration ranged from 0.012 to 2 mm. The moles of HA were expressed as moles of its disaccharide unit based on its molecular weight. The measurements were performed similarly to the initial velocity measurements with the exception that the data points were recorded in 6-s intervals for 1.5 min. The initial velocity for the degradation reaction was calculated based on the increase of absorbance during the first 90 s of the reaction. The measured data for initial velocity, vi, and the varied concentrations of substrate, S, were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v =V max S/(K m +S), with a nonlinear regression program (Scientist Micromath). In this equation, the K m is the Michaelis constant, and V max is the maximum velocity. For all of the experiments, goodness-of-fit statistics showed that R-squared and correlation values were greater than 0.957 and 0.982, respectively. As the results of the curve fitting show, the program afforded values ofV max and K m for the enzyme forms analyzed as well as their respective standard deviations (ς). From these curve-fitted data the values ofV max/K m parameter, and the 95% confidence limits (3xς) were obtained. Hyaluronan was degraded as previously described (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar). Briefly, for 1000 μl of 2.0 mg/ml of hyaluronan solution in 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm CaCl2 at pH 6.0, the following amounts of the enzyme forms were used: wild type, 35 ng; F343V, 2.5 μg; W292A, 2.5 μg; W292A/F343V, 50 μg; W291A/W292A, 50 μg; and W291A/W292A/F343V, 50 μg. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C and collected at 1, 5, and 10 min and 3, 7, 20, and 24 h (100 μl each). The degradation product mixtures were immediately separated on a Superdex peptide HR 10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) using 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 7.4. The eluting peak fraction identities were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometer on a Micromass Quattro LCZ tandem mass spectrometer using atmospheric pressure ionization and the conditions previously reported (10Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar, 27Price K.N. Tuinman A. Baker D.C. Chisena C. Cysyk R.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 303: 303-311Google Scholar). The crystallization for the mutant forms of the enzyme was performed similarly to the crystallization of the wild type hyaluronate lyase and as described (17Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 71-73Google Scholar). A hanging drop vapor diffusion with VDX culture plates and siliconized glass cover slides were used. Briefly, equal volumes (∼1 μl each) were mixed of reservoir solution and mutant proteins W292A, F343V, W292A/F343V, W291A/W292A, and W291A/W292A/F343V in buffer described earlier and at protein concentrations of 6.2, 5.5, 5.1, 5.6, and 5.10 mg/ml, respectively. The reservoir solution contained 60–65% saturated ammonium sulfate, 0.2m sodium chloride, 2% dioxane, and 50 mmsodium citrate buffer at pH 6.0. The crystals of the inactive mutant proteins W291A/W292A and W291A/W292A/F343V were in addition soaked in a hexasaccharide hyaluronan substrate (HA6) for 10 h prior to cryo-freezing. The soaking solution contained 75% saturated ammonium sulfate, 10 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 6.0 and 10 mm HA6. All of the mutant crystals were cryo-protected in 30% xylitol (w/v), 80% saturated ammonium sulfate, and 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before diffraction data collection. The diffraction data collection was performed at a synchrotron source utilizing Berkeley Center for Structural Biology, Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory beamline 5.0.1. The x-ray wavelength was 1.0 Å, and the crystal diffraction was recorded on a Quantum 4u CCD detector using the oscillation method. The data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The unit cells of crystals of mutants and their complexes were isomorphous to the native ones.

The R free flag was assigned to 1% of reflection for W292A, F343V, and W292A/F343V mutant diffraction data sets and 2% for W291A/W292A and W291A/W292A/F343V mutant complexes with HA6 data sets to validate the refinement progress (29Brunger A.T.

Initially, a round of rigid body refinements using only the model structure was performed using the refmac5 maximum likelihood protocol (31Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

The mutated residues were modified manually using the program O (33Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The refinements were continued using the restrained and unrestrained protocols of refmac5 (31Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The structures were refined against all reflections from 20.0 Å to the highest resolution available without any ς(F) cut-off (see Table I). The electron density for the HA6substrate for the W291A/W292A and W291A/W292A/F343V complex structures was clearly identified and was followed by the incorporation of the HA6 substrates into this density as previously described (19Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28287-28297Google Scholar, 34Jedrzejas M.J. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Glycoforum: Science of Hyaluronan Today.

The topologies/parameter files for the substrate were manually created following our earlier studies to reflect ideal stereochemical values. Additional refinements including individual anisotropic B-factor refinements for all structures, inspection, and manipulation of structures on graphics using O together with incorporation of water molecules placed into 3ς peaks in sigma-A weighted F o − F c maps following standard criteria were performed. After further refinements, water molecules whose positions were not supported by electron density, at 1ς contouring, in sigma-A weighted 2F o − F c maps were deleted. A variety of stereochemical (36Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Google Scholar) and other analyses (33Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

https://openalex.org/W2091332908,"Human tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (hTFPI-2) is a 32-kDa serine protease inhibitor that is associated with the extracellular matrix. hTFPI-2 inhibits several extracellular matrix-degrading serine proteases and may play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis. To study the signal transduction pathway that leads to the activation of the hTFPI-2, we cloned the potential promoter region of this gene adjacent to a heterologous luciferase reporter gene. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced the luciferase reporter gene in HEK293 cells and other epithelial cell lines, such as the human lung carcinoma A549 cells, the breast carcinoma MCF7 cells, and the cervical HeLa cells. This PMA induction was blocked with the MEK inhibitor UO126, suggesting that the PMA-induced activation of the hTFPI-2 promoter is mediated through MEK. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor induced the luciferase reporter gene in HeLa cells. Cotransfection of the luciferase construct with constitutively active components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in EcR-293 cells lead to a 7- to 92-fold induction of the luciferase reporter gene, indicating that regulation of hTFPI-2 is mediated through this pathway. A series of luciferase reporter gene constructs with progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking region suggested that the minimal basal promoter activity is located between nucleotide positions −89 and −384, whereas the minimal inducible promoter activity is between −89 and −222. We have used the computer program TFSEARCH and mutagenesis to analyze potential transcription factor binding sites. We identified an AP-1 binding site at nucleotide position −156 (inducible activity) and a Sp1 site at position −134 (basal activity) as potential cis-acting elements in the promoter region of the hTFPI-2.

Among the pathways often used to transduce signals are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. These cascades consist of a three-kinase module that includes an MEK kinase (MEKK), which activates an MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which in turn activates a MAPK (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Three well characterized MAPKs have been described in mammalian cells: the mitogen-responsive ERK, the stress-responsive JNK/SAPK, and the p38 MAPK. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade regulates cell proliferation and differentiation (2Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Components of this pathway are often activated in human tumors and oncogenic Ras, and constitutively activated ERKs have been found in a large variety of malignancies (3Shapiro P. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 285-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Sivaraman V.S. Wang H. Nuovo G.J. Malbon C.C. J. Clin.

Among the many activated genes, we have identified the human tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (hTFPI-2) as a gene that is highly up-regulated by the ERK/MAPK pathway. hTFPI-2 is a 32-kDa serine proteinase inhibitor with three tandem Kunitz-type domains (6Sprecher C.A.

Misugi K. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and has high homology to hTFPI-1, a regulator of the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway. The second Kunitz-type domain of hTFPI-1 binds to factor Xa, and this complex inhibits the activity of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex through interaction of the first Kunitz-type domain in hTFPI-1 and the active site of VIIa/TF (8Girard T.J.

Despite the high homology of hTFPI-2 to hTFPI-1, hTFPI-2 is a weak inhibitor of the activation of factor X (9Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and hTFPI-2 poorly inhibits tissue factor. However, hTFPI-2 inhibits the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex and a variety of serine proteases, including trypsin, plasmin, plasma kallikrein, chymotrypsin, and cathepsin G, but it does not inhibit thrombin, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (6Sprecher C.A.

Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Most of the hTFPI-2 expressed in dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells localizes within the extracellular matrix, probably bound to heparan sulfate (10Rao C.N. Liu Y.Y. Peavey C.L. Woodley D.T.

Mohanam S. Puppala A. Rao J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The role of hTFPI-2 in cancer progression is not completely elucidated. On one hand, hTFPI-2 has an anti-invasive effect that might be mediated via inhibition of plasmin that activates proteases promoting degradation of the extracellular matrix and tumor invasion. Several tumor cell lines were less invasive when they were stably transfected with hTFPI-2 cDNA (14Jin M. Udagawa K. Miyagi E. Nakazawa T. Hirahara F. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Nagashima Y. Aoki I.

Although it has been shown that PMA can stimulate hTFPI-2 gene expression in glioma cells and that the promoter region −312 to +1 is critical for minimal and inducible promoter activity of hTFPI-2 (19Konduri S.D.

Here we show that the hTFPI-2 gene expression is regulated by the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and that the activity of this pathway is directed to an AP-1 site in the promoter of the hTFPI-2 gene.

MEK-1SD was created by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using two complementary oligonucleotides. The nucleotides that were changed to obtain a serine to aspartic acid mutation in MEK-1SD are underlined in O-5 in Table I. The nucleotide sequence was verified by sequencing, and the MEK-1SD was released from Bluescript withBamHI/XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pIND. The plasmid mycCMV5-ERK2-MEK1-LA was kindly provided by Melanie H. Cobb, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX. The plasmid was digested with HindIII, the 5′-overhand was filled in with Klenow fragment, and ERK2-MEK1-LA was subsequently released byKpnI and cloned into the KpnI/EcoRV sites of pIND. Genomic DNA was isolated from 293 cells. The cells were washed in PBS, lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8, and incubated with proteinase K (10 mg/ml) at 50 °C overnight. After two phenol and two chloroform extractions, the genomic DNA was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in TE, pH 8. A 1.5-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the hTFPI-2 was amplified with an Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the oligonucleotides O-7 and O-8 (Table I) to create a KpnI and a BglII restriction site (printed in boldface). ThisKpnI/BglII fragment was cloned into the plasmid pXP2, which contains the firefly luciferase reporter (21Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar) and was a generous gift from Mark Featherstone, McGill University, Montreal, Canada. The resulting construct was named p-1511-luc. The sequence was found identical to the one published by Kamei (22Kamei S. Kazama Y. Kuijper J.L. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) except for a C to A change at nucleotide position −47 relative to the translation start site. The hTFP-2promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids p-1293-luc, p-1055-luc, p-881-luc, p-733-luc, p-384-luc, p-222-luc, and p-89-luc were created by restriction digest on the original p-1511-luc plasmid. The p-1511-luc plasmid was digested with DraI, EarI,NarI, MscI, EcoNI, EcoRI, and SmaI, respectively, and the DNA fragments were released by BglII digest. The 5′-overhang created by EarI,NarI, EcoNI, and EcoRI restriction digest was filled in with Klenow fragment, and the restriction fragments were cloned into the SmaI/BglII site of pXP2. The putative Sp1 transcription factor binding site GGGGCGG between nucleotide positions −190 and −184 was changed to GGGGCAA, the putative AP-1 siteTGAATCA between nucleotide positions −162 and −156 was altered to GCTAGCA, and the overlapping Sp1/AP-2 and GC box GGCTCCGCCCCGGCGGGGG between nucleotide positions −144 and −126 was modified to GGCTTTGCCCCAACGGGGG. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the corresponding nucleotide changes were phosphorylated, annealed, and cloned asHindIII/EagI fragments into the corresponding sites of p-1055-luc. Each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotides used for p-198MSP1A-luc were O-9 and O-10, for p-198MAP1-luc O-11 and O-12, and for p-198MSP1B/MAP2-luc O-13 and O-14 (Table I). p-222MAP1/MSP1B-luc and p-222MAP1/MAP2-luc were created by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system using the oligonucleotides O-15 and O-16 or O-17, respectively. In both constructs the putative AP-1 site TGAATCA between nucleotide positions −162 and −156 was altered toGCTAGCA, and either the putative Sp1 site between nucleotide positions −140 and −134 CCGCCCC altered to TTGCCCC or the putative AP-2 site between nucleotide positions −136 and −126 CCCGGCGGGGG was altered to CCCGGCAAGGG. The sequence for theHindIII and EagI restriction sites are printed in boldface, and the nucleotide changes are underlined (Table I). The PCR products were verified by sequencing and subcloned asHindIII/EagI fragments into the corresponding sites of p-1055-luc. For inhibitor studies, the HEK293 cells (150,000 cells/well) were seeded the day prior to transfection. The cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of p-1511-luc and 70 ng of a GFP-spectrin control plasmid (23Kalejta R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Where indicated, the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor UO126 was added 15 min prior to PMA induction. The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and divided into two tubes. Cells in one tube were lysed using cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the cell extract was assayed for firefly luciferase activity using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Light intensity was measured by using a microtiter plate luminometer (DYNEX Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA). The cells in the second tube were trypsinized and washed, and the percentage of cells that express GFP was determined by cytofluorimetry (EPICS XL-MCL) to control for transfection efficiency. Determination of protein by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) was carried out, controlling for harvesting efficiencies. Luciferase activity was expressed as firefly light units/μg of protein and normalized for transfection efficiency. HEK293, HeLa, A549, and MCF7 cells were seeded into six-well plates at 150,000, 250,000, 250,000, and 400,000 cells/well, respectively, 1 day prior to transfection. All cells were transfected with 1 μg of the reporter gene constructs. HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected with FuGENE6 at a 3 μl of FuGENE/1 μg of DNA ratio, and A549 and MCF7 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, the cells of each well were split into six wells of a 24-well plate. 7 h later, the cells were serum-starved overnight and subsequently treated with PMA (250 nm) or EGF (50 ng/ml) as indicated. Cell extracts were lysed and analyzed as described above. The -fold stimulation of luciferase was calculated as firefly light units/μg of protein of PMA- or EGF-treated cells divided by the firefly light units/μg of protein of nontreated cells. Two days prior to transfection, EcR-293 cells cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Zeocin (400 μg/ml) were seeded into six-well plates at 200,000 cells/well. EcR-293 cells stably express the modified ecdysone receptor. A gene of interest, cloned into a pIND-based inducible expression vector, can be induced with the ecdysone analog pronasteron A that binds to the ecdysone receptor. Cells were transfected with 6 μl of FuGENE6 and 1.07 μg of total DNA (0.9 μg of RasV12, RafCT, MEK-1SD, ERK2-MEK1-LA, or pIND control vector, 0.1 μg of reporter plasmid, and 70 ng of GFP control plasmid). The medium containing fetal bovine serum was replaced 24 h after transfection with DMEM without serum, pronasteron A was added 4 h later to the medium to induce protein expression at a concentration of 6 μm unless indicated differently, and cells were harvested 20 h later. Luciferase activity was expressed as firefly light units/μg of protein and normalized for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS. The cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.5% Triton X-100, and the proteinase inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). 15 μg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm TrisCl, pH 7.5) and subsequently incubated with the anti-myc (9E10) at a dilution of 1:250 at 4 °C overnight, or with anti-Raf-1 (C12), or anti-MEK1 (C18) at dilutions of 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. The Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody was diluted 1:1000 in TBST containing 4% skin milk powder and incubated for 1 h. After incubation with the secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000) for 1 h, the bands were visualized by ECL (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). We have observed that the hTFPI-2 gene was highly up-regulated on microarrays that were probed with cDNAs originating from HEK293 cells treated with 250 nm PMA for 4 h (data not shown). Recently, PMA induction of a hTFPI-2-luciferase reporter gene has also been shown in glioma cells (19Konduri S.D. Osman F.A. Rao C.N. Srinivas H. Yanamandra N. Tasiou A. Dinh D.H. Olivero W.C. Gujrati M. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Kouraklis G. Rao J.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and mRNA of hTFPI-2 is up-regulated in BeWo and JEG-3 trophoblast cells treated with PMA (24Iochmann S. Reverdiau-Moalic P. Hube F. Bardos P. Gruel Y. Thromb. Res. 2002; 105: 217-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To study the signaling pathway that leads to the induction of hTFPI-2 gene expression by PMA and to investigate important promoter elements involved in its transcriptional regulation, we PCR-amplified a 1511-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the hTFPI-2 gene from genomic DNA isolated from HEK293 cells and cloned the 1511-bp fragment adjacent to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (p-1511-luc). To assess whether this potential promoter region allows transcription of luciferase, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with the reporter plasmid p-1511-luc and monitored changes in luciferase activity of PMA-treated and untreated cells. Cells incubated with 250 nm PMA showed a 10-fold stimulation of luciferase compared with cells without PMA treatment (Fig.1 A). Induction of the luciferase reporter gene was decreased by 90% if cells were preincubated with the MEK1 inhibitor UO126 at a concentration of 10 μm. UO126 completely inhibited PMA induction at a concentration of 100 μm, suggesting that PMA activates the hTFPI-2 promoter through the MEK signaling pathway (Fig.1 A). As shown in the Western blot in Fig. 1 B, PMA activated p44/p42 MAPK in HEK293 cells and the phosphorylation of p44/p42 could be inhibited by the MEK1-inhibitor UO126 in a dose-dependent manner. This result indicates that MEK activation is necessary for the induction hTFPI-2 promoter activity by PMA. HEK293 cells have very recently been reported as atypical epithelial cells and may originate from neuronal cells (25Shaw G. Morse S. Ararat M. Graham F.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PMA induction of the hTFPI-2 gene observed in HEK293 cells was unique to this cell line or whether PMA promotes up-regulation of the hTFPI-2 gene in other epithelial cells lines as well, we transiently transfected human lung carcinoma A549 cells, breast carcinoma MCF7 cells and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells with the luciferase reporter plasmid p-1511-luc. A 3.7-fold PMA-dependent induction of the hTFPI-2 promoter activity was observed in A549 cells, whereas PMA induced the hTFPI-2 promoter activity in MCF7 and HeLa cells 30- or 20-fold, respectively (Fig.2). Because PMA has been reported to transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (26Chen N. Ma W.Y. She Q.B. Wu E. Liu G. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46722-46728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we tested whether the hTFPI-2 gene could be induced by the growth factor EGF. Although EGF up-regulated the hTFPI-2 promoter activity in HeLa cells 10-fold, no substantial stimulation of the luciferase reporter gene was obtained in A549 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 2). To assess the importance of the components of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in the regulation the hTFPI-2 promoter activity, we cotransfected EcR-293 cells with the plasmid p-1511-luc and vectors containing constitutively activated signaling components, such as RasV12, RafCT, MEK-1SD, ERK2-MEK1-LA, or the empty control vector (pIND). The -fold stimulation of luciferase was calculated as normalized luciferase activity obtained in cells expressing active signaling components divided by the luciferase activity of samples originating from vector-transfected control cells (Fig.3 A). Protein expression of RasV12, RafCT, MEK-1SD, and ERK2-MEK1-LA in transiently transfected EcR-293 cells is shown on Western blots in Fig. 3 B. All the constitutively activated signaling components were well expressed. Expression of RasV12 stimulated the luciferase reporter gene 37-fold compared with the control vector. Expression of constitutively active signaling MAPK components further downstream of Ras, such as RafCT, MEK-1SD, and ERK2-MEK1-LA, induced the luciferase reporter the gene 7-, 92-, or 39-fold, respectively (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the hTFPI-2 gene expression can be regulated by the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in EcR-293 cells. The highest activation of the hTFPI-2 promoter was obtained by MEK-1SD containing aspartic acids at amino acid positions 218/222 (27Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), whereas the RasV12 and ERK2-MEK1-LA fusion protein (28Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activated the hTFPI-2 promoter to a similar extent. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway mediates regulation of the hTFPI-2 gene. We transiently cotransfected EcR-293 cells with a series of luciferase reporter gene constructs containing progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking region with either a vector containing RasV12 or the empty control vector pIND. The -fold stimulations of the Rasversus control vector are shown in Fig.4 A. 35- to 51-fold stimulations of luciferase were obtained with constructs p-1511-luc through p-222-luc, whereas no inducible luciferase activity was obtained with construct p-89-luc, suggesting that the minimal inducible promoter activity is located between nucleotide positions −222 and −89 (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained in PMA-treated HEK293 cells expressing the deletion constructs. PMA stimulated p-1511-luc through p-222-luc 5- to 8-fold, whereas p-89-luc was not induced by PMA (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, we decided to investigate the promoter elements in the −222/−89 region that are responsible for the 51-fold Ras and 8-fold PMA stimulations as compared with control cells. The minimal basal promoter activity includes the −89/−384-bp region, because p-384-luc showed similar basal luciferase activity as longer constructs, whereas no basal activity was obtained with construct p-89-luc (Table II). As shown in Table II, the luciferase activity dropped by 74% in vector (pIND)-transfected cells expressing p-222-luc compared with cells expressing p-384-luc, indicating that the region,"

The mammalian enzyme consists of 13 subunits and has a well characterized structure (1Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S.

The three largest subunits, which are encoded in mitochondrial DNA, form the catalytic core of the enzyme, with subunits 1 and 2 binding the prosthetic groups required for electron transfer. There are two heme A molecules, both of which are located in the hydrophobic interior of subunit 1 and, based on their spectral properties, are denoted hemes a anda3. In addition, there are two copper atoms that form the binuclear CuA site in subunit 2 and a single copper atom (designated CuB) located adjacent to the hemea3 site in subunit 1 (2Tsukihara T.

The nuclear genome contributes the remaining 10 subunits, which are thought to play a primarily structural role. In contrast to the wealth of information about the structure of cytochrome oxidase, the mechanism by which the holoenzyme complex is assembled remains unclear.

This information is important for understanding the mechanism of COX assembly and for elucidating the genetic basis of human COX deficiencies (14Shoubridge E.A. Am. J. Med.

Here we report the identification and characterization of Cox16p, a new COX assembly factor encoded by a previously uncharacterized yeast open reading frame (YJL003w; GenBankTM accession number Z49278). Mutations in COX16 result in a failure to complete assembly of cytochrome oxidase, and cox16 mutants are respiration-deficient. Cox16p does not appear to function in mitochondrial copper homeostasis or in the synthesis of heme A. The phenotype of cox16 mutants also argues against a role of Cox16p in processing of Cox2p or membrane insertion of the mitochondrially encoded subunits of COX. Like many of the other COX assembly factors, Cox16p is an integral component of the mitochondrial inner membrane and appears to exist in a higher molecular weight complex. Recent additions to the data base reveal that COX16has homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, as well as in the murine and human genomes. Human COX16 is thus a candidate gene for human COX deficiencies in which mutations in the known COX assembly factors have not been identified. The genotypes of the strains used in this study are indicated in TableI. The composition of media for growth and analysis of yeast strains has been described elsewhere (16Myers A.M. Pape L.K.

Open table in a new tab The yeast genomic library used to clone COX16 was constructed from partialSau3A fragments of nuclear DNA of the respiratory-competent haploid strain S. cerevisiae D273–10B/A1. C25/U1, a mutant from complementation group G22 (8Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed with the yeast genomic library as described previously (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the COX16gene identified by isolating subclones capable of conferring respiratory competence on C25/U1. The COX16 gene was disrupted by insertion of a 1.1-kb URA3 fragment at the internal HindIII site and transformation of the respiratory-competent haploid strain, W303–1A, with the linear fragment containing the disrupted gene and flanking sequences. The transformation yielded the cox16 mutant aW303ΔCOX16. To overexpress a Cox16p-myc fusion protein, we first constructed pMGL5, a yeast/Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid containing a Myc epitope tag in the backbone of the multicopy vector YEp351 (17Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 3.3-kb Nar1-AatII fragment of YEp351 containing the LEU2 marker and the 2-μm origin of replication, was used to replace a 3.8-kbNar1-AatII fragment in YCpmyc111 (a gift from Dr. Troy Harkness, modified from Gietz and Sugino (18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar)). This converted the CEN plasmid into an episomal plasmid. To make the Myc fusion,COX16 was amplified by PCR, using primers that introduced aPstI site 216 nucleotides upstream of the start codon (5′-gttattagactgcagatacacttcc-3′) and a SmaI site two nucleotides upstream of the termination codon (5′-cgttttgaatgttcccgggcattc-3′). The 416-bp PCR product was ligated to pMGL5, resulting in an in-frame fusion of Cox16p to the Myc epitope at the C terminus. The same COX16 fragment was also fused to the Myc sequence in the CEN plasmid YCpmyc111. Both constructs were verified to be in-frame by automated sequencing (LiCor, Lincoln, NE). Transformation of yeast was carried out by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (19Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown to stationary phase in YPGal, and mitochondria were isolated as described previously (20Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For analysis of in vivo labeled mitochondrial translation products, strains were grown in YPGal and labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide (21Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The labeling reaction was terminated after 15 min by addition of an excess of 80 mm cold methionine and 80 μg/ml puromycin (0 time). Samples of the cultures were incubated at 30 °C and collected at 15 and 30 min, pelleted, and resuspended in 75 μl of a mixture containing 1.8 m NaOH, 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were precipitated by addition of an equal volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet washed once with 0.5 m Tris, twice with water, and resuspended in 50 μl of sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Labeled mitochondrial proteins were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 6m urea and 6% glycerol, and the gel was dried prior to autoradiography. Mitochondrial preparations used for the inner membrane localization were isolated as described by Glick (23Glick B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Density gradient centrifugation was carried out using mitochondria (3 mg) from aW303ΔCOX16/myc1, which were extracted with 1% deoxycholate and 0.5m NaCl and loaded onto 2.4 ml of 7–20% sucrose gradients (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase (0.3 mg) was added to the extract as an internal standard, along with 2.5 mg hemoglobin. Gradients were chilled at 4 °C for 1 h before addition of the extract and, following loading of the samples, centrifuged in a Beckman Optima TLX tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) for 12 h at 54,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome oxidase activity and mitochondrial cytochrome spectral analyses were carried out as described by Tzagoloff et al. (25Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with 12% gels (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), 15% gels with glycerol (26Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), or 16.5% gels containing 6 m urea (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). Western analysis was carried out as described previously using antibodies against subunits of cytochrome oxidase or Sco1p (28Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or commercial antibodies to the Myc epitope tag (Sigma). Immunoblots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). S. cerevisiae strains C25 and E699 of complementation group G22 of a pet mutant collection (8Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are respiration-deficient due to a specific loss of cytochrome oxidase. Spectral analysis of mitochondria isolated from C25 and E699 show a partial or complete loss of the 605-nm cytochromeaa 3 peak, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Since the respiratory defect is complemented by ρ0 mutants, the cytochrome oxidase lesion stems from recessive mutations in a nuclear gene, which has been designated as COX16. As in other COX assembly-defective mutants (20Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the steady state concentrations of subunits 1, 2, and 3 are very low in thecox16 mutant (Fig. 1 B). With the exception of subunit 5, which is slightly reduced, the other nuclear-encoded subunits are present at normal concentrations. In vivolabeling of C25 in the presence of cycloheximide to block cytoplasmic protein synthesis, indicated that the three mitochondrially encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase are correctly expressed (Fig. 1 C), although labeling of Cox2p appeared to be slightly less than in wild type. To assess if Cox16p participates in export of the Cox2p precursor, the size and stability of this mitochondrial gene product was compared in different COX null mutants sharing the same nuclear background. The results of the in vivo pulse-chase labeling experiment confirmed that only processed Cox2p is detected in the cox16 null mutant aW303ΔCOX16 after the 15-min pulse (Fig. 2). Since proteolytic cleavage of the presequence requires export of the N-terminal transmembrane domain to the intermembrane space (29Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), these results exclude Cox16p from having a function in membrane insertion of the N-terminal domain of the precursor. The pulse-chase results also make it unlikely that Cox16p is involved in membrane insertion of the C-terminal domain of Cox2p. By comparison, the turnover of Cox2p in a cox18 mutant was greatly increased compared with the wild type or other COX mutants (e.g. cox15). Cox18p is required for the export of the C-terminal domain of Cox2p (30Saracco S.A. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1122-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the rapid degradation of the protein probably occurs as a consequence of exposure of the C terminus to proteolytic enzymes of the inner membrane and/or matrix. In contrast, Cox2p turnover was similar in the cox15 andcox16 mutants during the 30-min chase (Fig. 2). Since Cox15p functions in heme A synthesis (31Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9997-10002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the turnover rate of Cox2p incox15 mutants is unlikely to be due to a problem with membrane insertion, and the decreased amount of Cox2p incox16 and cox15 mutants is likely related to the general block in COX assembly. The reduction of newly synthesized Cox1p observed in the three mutants is a hallmark of most COX assembly mutants examined to date. 2A. Barrientos and A. Tzagoloff, unpublished studies. Analysis of mitochondrial hemes in both the C25/U1 and cox16null mutant revealed the presence of heme A and heme O (data not shown) in amounts seen with most other COX assembly mutants (7Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cox16p is not involved in heme A biosynthesis. Finally, the respiratory deficiency of C25/U1 and the cox16 null mutant were not rescued by supplementation of the growth medium with copper, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, or zinc (data not shown). This result does not, however, exclude Cox16p from having a function in transport or insertion of one of the heavy metals known to be associated with COX. To identify the gene responsible for the cytochrome oxidase deficiency of G22 mutants, C25/U1 was transformed with a yeast genomic library, and uracil prototrophic clones were checked for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources. A transformant, C25/U1/T1, rescued both the uracil auxotrophy and respiratory deficiency and was used to obtain the recombinant plasmid pG22/T1, which contained an insert of genomic DNA ∼7 kb in length. This plasmid restored respiration when back transformed into the mutant. Subcloning generated the construct pG22/ST2, which conferred respiratory competence to C25/U1, and sequencing of this construct identified the gene responsible for the complementation. Comparison of the putative COX16 open reading frame to the current databases revealed that the COX16 gene is identical to open reading frame YJL003w on chromosome X (GenBank accession numberZ49278) in the yeast genome. COX16 was disrupted to ascertain that the respiratory deficiency of G22 mutants is caused by mutations in this gene. The mutant allele was obtained by inserting a 1-kb HindIII fragment containing the URA3 gene at an internalHindIII site of COX16 in pG22/ST2, yielding pG22/ST4. The respiratory-competent haploid strain W303–1A was transformed with a linear BglII-SphI fragment of pG22/ST4. An uracil-independent and respiration-deficient transformant (aW303ΔCOX16) was determined by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA to have the URA3 insertion in COX16 (not shown). The biochemical phenotype of aW303ΔCOX16 was ascertained to be similar to that of G22 mutants. It displays a selective absence of cytochromes aa 3 and a loss of cytochrome oxidase activity. The cytochrome oxidase deficiency, combined with the lack of complementation of aW303ΔCOX16 by C25 and E699, constitutes strong evidence that the mutations in these strains are allelic with thecox16 disruption. Cox16p consists of 118 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 14.1 kDa. The sequence includes one potential transmembrane domain (Fig. 3). The presence of a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus (Fig. 3 B) is predicted by the P-Sort program (//psort.nibb.ac.jp/helpwww2.html). The amino acid composition of Cox16p is biased toward acidic residues, and analysis of the putative mature protein reveals a pI of 5.0 (//ca.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). Cox16p does not reveal any homology to proteins of known function in the most recent databases, nor does it appear to have any identifiable functional domains that might provide clues about its function. The location of Cox16p was studied with a Myc-tagged protein. Because of the presence of a potential cleavable N-terminal signal sequence, the Myc epitope was added at the C terminus. Growth of transformants, expressing the tagged protein from either a high copy episomal (aW303ΔCOX16/myc1) or low copy CEN plasmid (aW303ΔCOX16/myc2) on non-fermentable carbon sources (ethanol/glycerol), was indistinguishable from that of transformants expressing an untagged version of Cox16p. Restoration of growth on these substrates correlated with the recovery of cytochrome oxidase. This was evident from the spectra (not shown) and Western analysis of COX subunits (Fig. 1 B). The concentrations of the three mitochondrially encoded subunits and subunit 5 in the transformants are similar to the wild type levels, regardless of the vector used to express the Myc-tagged Cox16p (Fig. 1 B). A low molecular weight protein in mitochondria from aW303ΔCOX16/myc1 and aW303ΔCOX16/myc2 is detected with the Myc antibody (Fig. 4 A). This band is absent in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction from these strains and is also undetectable in wild type and mutant mitochondria. Based on its migration, this protein has an apparent mass of 21 kDa, which is 6 kDa larger than the combined size of native Cox16p and the additional 1 kDa contributed by the Myc epitope. The reason for the discrepancy, which may be even larger if Cox16p has a cleavable signal, is not clear but is probably related to anomalous binding of SDS by this acidic protein. Almost all of the COX assembly factors identified to date are constituents of the mitochondrial inner membrane, as would be expected from their involvement in assembly of a hydrophobic multimeric complex of this membrane. The prediction of a membrane-spanning domain in Cox16p suggested that it might be an integral membrane protein. This is confirmed by the solubility properties of the protein. Titration of aW303ΔCOX16/myc1 mitochondria with deoxycholate in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl showed that extraction of Cox16p-myc requires a minimum of 0.25% detergent (Fig. 4 B). Western analysis of intact mitochondria and mitoplasts from aW303ΔCOX16/myc1 revealed Cox16p to be a constituent of the mitochondrial inner membrane as it is only found in the pelleted, mitoplast fraction (Fig. 4 C). Treatment with proteinase K caused Cox16p to be degraded in mitoplasts but not mitochondria. The decreased signal seen in the proteinase K-treated mitochondria is probably due to a subpopulation of mitochondria with damaged outer membranes. Similar results were obtained when mitochondria and mitoplasts were probed with antibody against Sco1p, an inner membrane protein protruding into the intermembrane space (32Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, subunit 5 is protected from digestion by proteinase K in mitoplasts (data not shown). Some of the COX assembly factors characterized to date appear to be part of higher molecular weight homo- or heteroligomeric complexes (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,21Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A.

The native molecular mass of Cox16p-myc was estimated, by sedimentation of a 1% deoxycholate extract of mitochondria in a 7 to 20% linear sucrose gradient, to be ∼84 kDa for both aW303ΔCOX16/myc1 and aW303ΔCOX16/myc2 (data not shown). Searches of current protein and expressed sequence tag databases indicate that Cox16p appears to have a human (HSCP203; accession number NP_057552) and a murine (accession number NP_079737) homologue. The human cDNA was originally identified in a screen for novel proteins expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (35Zhang Q.H., Ye, M., Wu, X.Y. Ren S.X. Zhao M. Zhao C.J., Fu, G. Shen Y. Fan H.Y., Lu, G. Zhong M., Xu, X.R. Han Z.G. Zhang J.W. Tao J. Huang Q.H. Zhou J., Hu, G.X., Gu, J. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1546-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Human COX16 is located on the long arm of chromosome 14, in the interval 14q22.1–14q24.3 (LOC51241). Fig. 5presents an alignment of the Cox16 proteins from yeast, humans, and mice. This analysis reveals that the highest sequence conservation is in the region of the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal half. The four Cox16 proteins shown in Fig. 5 share 24% identity and 40% conserved residues. To test if the human gene can complement the yeast cox16mutant the cDNA for human COX16 was amplified by PCR from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The cDNA was cloned into a yeast expression vector containing the ADH1 promoter and terminator in a YEp351 backbone, 3D. M. Glerum and D. L. Adams, manuscript in preparation. allowing constitutive expression of proteins from cDNAs with their own start codons. This construct (pCOX16H/ST1) did not complement the respiratory deficiency of the aW303ΔCOX16 parent strain even after prolonged incubation on a non-fermentable carbon source (7 days), whereas the yeast COX16 gene restores growth on ethanol/glycerol after one night. These results indicate that the human gene is homologous, but not orthologous, to yeast COX16. The yeast COX16 gene product reported in this study is a mitochondrial protein with an essential function in COX assembly. The absence of cytochrome oxidase in cox16 mutants is accompanied by a loss of the cytochrome aa 3spectral signal and a marked reduction in the steady state concentrations of the mitochondrial-encoded but not nuclear-encoded subunits of COX. The exception is Cox5p, which is also reduced in thecox16 mutant but not in other previously studied COX mutants. It is unclear whether this observation is relevant to the function of Cox16p. Like most COX assembly factors characterized to date, Cox16p is an integral component of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The protease protection experiments indicate that the C terminus of Cox16p-myc is exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. This orientation implies that the hydrophobic sequence, proximal to the N terminus, acts as a stop-transfer signal (36Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The location of the N-terminal transmembrane domain combined with the orientation of Cox16p in the inner membrane implies that the active region is in the hydrophilic C-terminal half and is located in the intermembrane space. At present, all the COX assembly factors with this orientation have Cox2p as their target. Sco1p is inferred to function in maturation of the CuA site (28Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the Imp protease is responsible for removal of the Cox2p N-terminal presequence (37Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and Cox20p is a chaperone of the Cox2p precursor that is required for the proteolytic processing step (10Hell K. Tzagoloff A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4571-4578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The presence of stable and mature Cox2p in the mutant excludes the involvement of Cox16p in export or proteolytic processing of the N-terminal extension. Attempts to relate Cox16p to maturation of a metal center in the enzyme have also been negative. Copper and other heavy metals, known to be present in COX, do not rescuecox16 mutants when added to the growth medium. This result does not, however, rule out an indirect role for Cox16p in the acquisition of any one of these metals by the enzyme. Studies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shed considerable light on the widely differing roles that the dozen or more currently known nuclear-encoded factors play in COX assembly (15Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene. 2002; 286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Homologous proteins for most of these assembly factors have been identified in many other genomes, including human (38Amaravadi R. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Hum.

The yeast model has also facilitated the attribution of some autosomal recessively inherited human COX deficiencies to mutations in genes coding for proteins involved in heme A biosynthesis (42Valnot I. von Kleist-Retzow J.C.

The human COX16 homologue does not complement a yeast cox16 mutant, which may indicate a different function for human COX16 or may be due to the heterologous context. The inability of a mammalian gene to exert its function in a yeast background is not without precedent. Only about one-third of the human COX assembly factors identified to date complement corresponding yeast mutants (38Amaravadi R. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 40Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tend to think, therefore, that human COX16 has the same function as yeast Cox16p. The discovery of a new COX assembly factor provides another candidate gene for sequencing in patients with autosomal recessively inherited COX deficiencies without identified mutations."

In K562 cells stably expressing transfected αvβ3, adhesion to vitronectin required tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3subunit and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C. In contrast, adhesion to fibronectin proceeded without β3-tyrosine phosphorylation or the activities of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or protein kinase C. Firm adhesion to both ligands and actin stress fiber formation required both Syk and Rho activity, suggesting that each ligand employs unique signaling pathways to achieve an active integrin complex, likely merging at a common RhoGEF such as Vav. Distinct signaling by a single integrin species interacting with different ligands permits initiation of additional cellular processes specific to the current task and provides an explanation for what has been described as promiscuous ligand specificity among integrins.

Distinct signaling by a single integrin species interacting with different ligands permits initiation of additional cellular processes specific to the current task and provides an explanation for what has been described as promiscuous ligand specificity among integrins. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that mediate adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix proteins and to other cells. Consequently, integrins have a pivotal role in numerous developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. The integrin family contains at least 18 α and β subunits that combine to produce 24 known heterodimer combinations with distinct cell expression patterns and overlapping ligand specificities (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Binding of ligand to the integrin extracellular domain induces a conformational change that is propagated to the cytoplasmic domain and initiates downstream signaling events (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The ability to self-regulate adhesion to complex extracellular matrices is of particular importance to hematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic cells circulate in a non-adhesive state until such time as they encounter pro-inflammatory or thrombotic signals, after which they arrest from the circulation by means of firm adhesion to the vascular walls and, in leukocytes, migrate to the site of inflammation. The ability of hematopoietic cells to regulate their adhesion-dependent extravasation is mediated in part by the integrin αvβ3 (2Weerasinghe D. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Brown E.J. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 595-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The αvβ3 integrin plays a vital role in the adhesion of many cell types to the extracellular matrix and to other cells. Although it is termed the vitronectin (Vn) 1The abbreviations used are: Vn, vitronectin; Fn, fibronectin; PKC, protein kinase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; LIBS, ligand-induced binding site; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RBD, RhoA binding domain receptor, it is in fact a promiscuous receptor that recognizes a number of extracellular ligands including fibronectin (Fn), tenascin, and osteopontin (1van der Flier A.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, promiscuous may be an unfortunate term because recent studies show that differential signaling by distinct αvβ3 ligands may in fact result in unique cellular responses (4Boettiger D. Lynch L. Blystone S. Huber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31684-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that when αvβ3 is expressed in the K562 cell line, these cells exhibit differential adhesion to Vn and Fn (4Boettiger D. Lynch L. Blystone S. Huber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31684-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn requires tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-747 within the β3cytoplasmic tail and is dependent upon PKC activation, whereas αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn is constitutive, requiring neither of these events (4Boettiger D. Lynch L. Blystone S. Huber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31684-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 2: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, αvβ3-mediated adhesion of LNCaP cells to osteopontin, but not Vn, activates PI3K. However, this signaling pathway may be cell type-specific as PC3 cells activate PI3K upon adhesion to both osteopontin and Vn (6Zheng D.Q. Woodard A.S. Tallini G. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24565-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study we sought to establish the signaling events that might necessitate β3-tyrosine phosphorylation in αvβ3-mediated adhesion by comparing actin cytoskeletal organization and signaling events after attachment to distinct ligands. We show that αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn is constitutive and independent of β3-tyrosine phosphorylation because cells expressing αvβ3 Y747F,Y759F (Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F) firmly adhere to Fn, equivalent to cells expressing wild type αvβ3 (Kαvβ3), even in the absence of PKC activation. In contrast, firm adhesion to Vn requires both cellular PKC activation as well as β3-tyrosine phosphorylation. Coincident with cell adhesion is a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton into stress fibers. On a Fn substrate, Kαvβ3 exhibited spontaneous stress fiber formation, whereas Kαvβ3 attached to Vn required PKC activation to achieve this cellular phenotype. Mutation of the β3 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues had no effect on Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F organization of stress fibers when attached to Fn but eliminated PKC-dependent stress fiber formation upon attachment to Vn. Because Rho activity is believed to mediate actin stress fiber assembly, we examined Rho activity in Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells attached to Vn and Fn. We show that the constitutive nature of the adhesion to Fn by Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F is due in part to direct activation of Rho. Interestingly, whereas apparently unrelated to the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3, adhesion to Vn, but not Fn, results in increased PI3K activity. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibits the PKC-dependent adhesion of Kαvβ3 to Vn, whereas adhesion to Fn is unaffected by the presence of wortmannin. These results indicate that αvβ3-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton, a requisite event in cell adhesion, occurs via unique, ligand-dependent mechanisms. K562 cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding wild type (Kαvβ3), Y747F,Y759F (Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F) β3 or wild type (KαVβ5) β5 together with αV and maintained as previously described (7Blystone S.D.

Anti-p85 rabbit polyclonal was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Rho mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc (Denver, CO). β3 surface expression in stably transfected K562 cells was monitored using flow cytometry. Untransfected K562 cells or Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells were incubated with mAb anti-β3 AP3 in IMDM for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in IMDM and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. To quantify binding site equality of β3 by 7G2 and LIBS-1, Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells were stimulated with or without GRGDS peptide (1 mm) or wortmannin (10 μm) in IMDM for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in IMDM and incubated with either 7G2 or LIBS-1 anti-β3 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed in IMDM and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. Flow cytometry was carried out using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL). Data are expressed as mean channel fluorescence for at least three separate experiments. 96-Well microtiter plates (Immulon II, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml), vitronectin (1 μg/ml), 7G2 anti-β3 (0.5 μg/ml), LIBS-1 anti-β3 (0.5 μg/ml), or casein (50 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed twice in PBS and post-coated with 1.0% casein in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells were added at 1 × 105 cells/well in Hank's-buffered saline solution containing 1.0 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ with or without PMA (10 ng/ml) and C3 exoenzyme (10 μg/ml) after treatment with saponin (50 μg/ml) for 3 min, piceatannol (50 μg/ml), or wortmannin (10 μm) and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were rinsed 3 times in Hank's-buffered saline solution without Ca2+ or Mg2+, and adherent cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C and stained with 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. Crystal violet was dispersed in methanol and quantified by absorbance at 570 nm using an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 6-well tissue culture treated plates were coated with Vn (1 μg/ml), Fn (10 μg/ml), anti-β3 7G2 (0.5 μg/ml), or anti-β3 LIBS-1 (0.5 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/well in serum-free IMDM media containing 75 μm sodium orthovanadate with or without PMA (10 ng/ml), bisindolylmaleimide (10 μm), piceatannol (50 μg/ml), or wortmannin (10 μm). The cells were lysed in PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with gelatin-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-mouse-Sepharose beads (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) coated with anti-β3 1A2 and anti-αV 3F12 monoclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were divided equally to determine β3-tyrosine phosphorylation and total β3. Samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 3% v/v bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) for phosphotyrosine or mAb 7G2 for total β3. The membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG2b (Caltag Laboratories, Burlington, CA) for phosphotyrosine β3 and peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for total β3. Proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Acid-washed glass coverslips were coated overnight with Vn (1 μg/ml) or Fn (5 μg/ml). Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells were permitted to adhere to coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of PMA (10 ng/ml). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized in ice-cold PBS containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and stained with 0.7 μm rhodamine-phalloidin for 15 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY), and images were retained digitally with a SpotCamII digital camera and software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). 6-well tissue-coated plates were coated with Vn (1 μg/ml), Fn (10 μg/ml), recombinant Fn III-10 (10 μg/ml), Fn III-10RGE (10 μg/ml), 7G2 (0.5 μg/ml), or LIBS-1 (0.5 μg/ml), and Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/well in the presence or absence of PMA (10 ng/ml), C3 exoenzyme (10 μg/ml) after treatment with saponin (50 μg/ml) for 3 min, piceatannol (50 μg/ml), or wortmannin (10 μm) and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Rho activity was assayed as previously described (10Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). Cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. GTP-bound Rho was affinity-purified from lysates using a GST fusion construct of the RhoA binding domain of rhotekin (GST-RBD) (kindly provided by M. A. Schwartz, Scripps Institute). Lysates were incubated with GST-RBD (∼25 μg) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. GTP-bound RhoA was separated using 12% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Total Rho was determined by loading 1/10 total volume of cell lysate on a 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in TBST with 3% v/v bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with murine mAb to RhoA (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO). The membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG, and proteins were detected with ECL. 6-Well tissue culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated as above. Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/well in the presence or absence of PMA (10 ng/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were divided evenly for phospho-AKT Ser473 and total AKT and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in TBST with 3% v/v bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with sheep polyclonal antibodies to AKT (0.1 μg/ml) or to phospho-AKT Ser-473 (0.5 μg/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-coupled anti-sheep IgG, and proteins were detected with ECL. Kαvβ3and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F (1 × 107) were treated with or without Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP) (1 mm) in the presence or absence of orthovanadate (0.75 μm) for 20 min at room temperature to induce β3-tyrosine phosphorylation (11Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46886-46890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with gelatin-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-mouse-Sepharose beads (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) coated with anti-β3 1A2 and anti-αV 3F12 monoclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C.

Proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). To investigate the influence of the extracellular ligand on αvβ3-mediated adhesion and actin cytoskeletal organization, we examined the ability of K562 cells, expressing wild type (Kαvβ3) or Y747F,Y759F (Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F) αvβ3, to adhere to Vn or Fn in the presence or absence of the cellular agonist PMA. Kαvβ3 cells adhere to Vn only after cellular activation by PMA (Fig. 1 A); however, Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells are incapable of strong adhesion to Vn even after cellular activation. As we have previously reported, both Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells are capable of constitutive adhesion to Fn with or without cellular PKC activation by PMA (Fig. 1 A) (4Boettiger D. Lynch L. Blystone S. Huber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31684-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether the constitutive adhesion to Fn is αvβ3-mediated, we exposed K562 cells stably expressing αVβ5(KαVβ5) to Vn and Fn in the presence or absence of PMA. KαVβ5 cells do not adhere to Fn even in the presence of PMA nor do untransfected K562 cells (data not shown), indicating that constitutive adhesion of Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells to Fn is αvβ3-mediated. Actin cytoskeletal reorganization plays a key role in the ability of cells to adhere to the extracellular matrix (13Hogg N. Harvey J. Cabanas C. Landis R.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 148 (Pt. 2): S55-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells attached to Vn or Fn with or without cellular PKC activation. Both Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells, when allowed to adhere to Fn for 1 h, display a spread phenotype independent of PKC activation via PMA. Fluorescent microscopy of these cells reveals the formation of actin fibers (Fig. 1, F–I) within 1 h of attachment to Fn, and thus, actin fiber formation on Fn is independent of both β3 tyrosine phosphorylation and PKC activation via PMA. In contrast, actin fiber formation on Vn is dependent upon cellular PKC activation and β3-tyrosine phosphorylation. No actin fibers are seen in Kαvβ3 cells on Vn in the absence of PMA stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Stress fibers can be seen in Kαvβ3 cells after adhesion to Vn for 1 h only in the presence of PMA (Fig. 1 C). In addition, β3-tyrosine phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in firm adhesion to Vn, as no stress fiber formation occurs within Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells even after stimulation with PMA (Fig. 1, D and E). To elucidate the possible signaling mechanisms underlying the differences in αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn or Fn we utilized specific inhibitors to various signaling molecules. PMA-induced firm adhesion of Kαvβ3 cells to Vn was inhibited by pretreatment with the Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme (100 nm), the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (10 μm), and the Syk inhibitor piceatannol (50 μg/ml). These results indicate that Rho, PI3K, and Syk are involved in PMA-induced firm adhesion to Vn (Fig. 2 A). Firm adhesion of Kαvβ3 cells to Fn was also inhibited by C3 exoenzyme and piceatannol (Fig 2 A); however, no inhibition of firm adhesion to Fn was seen with wortmannin, suggesting that PI3K activity is not required for αvβ3-mediated firm adhesion to Fn. Inhibition with C3 exoenzyme and piceatannol reduced adhesion to both Fn and Vn to levels comparable with adhesion to casein (50 μg/ml) (data not shown). Cells expressing Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F are unable to adhere to Vn even after cellular PKC activation by PMA. Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells exhibit the same inhibition pattern as Kαvβ3 cells on Fn in that there is complete inhibition of adhesion after pretreatment with C3 exoenzyme and piceatannol; however, we see no inhibition of adhesion with wortmannin (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn, already shown to be independent of β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, is dependent upon Rho and Syk activity but not PI3K activity. In contrast αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn is dependent upon PI3K activity as well as Rho and Syk. The inhibitory effect of wortmannin on Vn is not due to a decrease in β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, because we show that in response to RGD, β3-tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited fully in the presence of piceatannol but only minimally in the presence of wortmannin or the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (Fig. 3). Therefore, wortmannin inhibition of adhesion to Vn is not due to an inhibition of β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, although piceatannol inhibition of adhesion to Vn may in part be due to inhibition of β3-tyrosine phosphorylation. However, this may be unlikely because piceatannol also inhibits Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F adhesion to Fn, where β3 phosphorylation is not required.Figure 3Selective inhibition of ligand induced β3-tyrosine phosphorylation (PY). Shown is a Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb from β3 immunoprecipitates from1 × 106 Kαvβ3 cells treated with or without RGD (1 mm) and specific inhibitors for PKC (10 μm bisindolylmaleimide), PI3K (10 μm wortmannin), or Syk (50 μg/ml piceatannol). Total β3 was determined by Western blot of half the β3 immunoprecipitation probed with mAb 7G2.

Here we demonstrate that αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn as well as stress fiber formation requires neither PKC activation nor β3-tyrosine phosphorylation. To determine whether the constitutive firm adhesion to Fn is mediated by Rho activation we assayed Rho activity using a GST-RBD pull-down assay for active GTP-bound Rho in cells that were allowed to adhere to Vn or Fn with or without PMA (Fig. 4 A). Elevated Rho activity was seen in both Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells that were allowed to adhere to Fn for 1 h even in the absence of PMA stimulation. In contrast, adhesion to Vn did not lead to an increase in Rho activity in Kαvβ3 cells unless there was coincident cellular PKC activation and only minor increases in Rho activity were seen in Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F under similar conditions. To confirm that the constitutive adhesion and Rho activation on Fn is αvβ3-mediated we show that when KαVβ5 cells are exposed to Fn there is no significant Rho activation even in the presence of PMA (Fig. 4 A). Additionally, untransfected K562 cells exhibit no Rho activity on either Vn or Fn (data not shown). We also show that when PI3K is inhibited by the presence of wortmannin, Rho activation is inhibited in Kαvβ3 cells adherent to Vn but not on Fn (Fig. 4 B). Control addition of C3 exoenzyme inhibits Rho activity in cells adherent to either Vn or Fn. This suggests that when αvβ3 is bound to Fn there is a direct activation of Rho that circumvents the need for PKC activity, β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, and PI3K activity. These results support a hypothesis in which external stimulation, β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, and PI3K are required for Rho activation and subsequent αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn. This supports our previous work suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 is required for the actions of PKC during αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn. To determine whether sites other than the RGD motif of Fn are responsible for the constitutive adhesion of Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells we employed recombinant Fn fragment III-10 and assayed for Rho activity. We find activated Rho in Kαvβ3 cells adhered to FnIII-10 regardless of PMA activation (Fig. 4 C). However, when KαVβ5 cells are adhered to FnIII-10 there is no Rho activity even in the presence of PMA. In addition when Kαvβ3 and KαVβ5cells are allowed to adhere to FnIII-10RGE, in which the RGD motif has been changed to RGE, there is no constitutive Rho activity (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that it is the RGD motif of Fn that is required for constitutive αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn. In this study we show that inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin inhibits both adhesion to Vn and Rho activation. To investigate the role of PI3K in αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn and Fn, we measured phosphorylated Ser-473 AKT as an indicator of PI3K activity and also the association of PI3K with β3 (6Zheng D.Q. Woodard A.S. Tallini G. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24565-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F were adhered to Vn or Fn, and phospho-Ser-473 levels were detected using a phospho-specific AKT Ser-473 antibody. Phospho-Ser-473 can only be detected in Kαvβ3 cells adherent to Vn (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that PI3K is active in a ligand-dependant manner only on Vn. Having demonstrated that the inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin does not inhibit β3-tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3), we investigated the role of β3-tyrosine phosphorylation in PI3K localization. Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F were treated with RGD to induce β3-tyrosine phosphorylation and Western blotted with anti-p85 after β3 immunoprecipitations, demonstrating p85 association specifically with tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 (Fig. 5 B). Additionally, the removal of Na3VO4, which reduces β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, partially blocked association of p85 with β3. These results indicate that PI3K is activated in a αvβ3-ligand-dependent manner and associates with αvβ3 in a β3-tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Various anti-β3 antibodies have been developed that recognize specific epitopes within the extracellular domain of β3, and some of the more useful anti-β3 antibodies developed are the ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) antibodies (19Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21609-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These LIBS antibodies recognize epitopes that are exposed within the integrin extracellular domain upon binding to an RGD sequence within an ECM protein such as Vn or Fn. Using this we have explored the possibility that αvβ3 may in fact exhibit adhesive properties to different anti-β3 antibodies that mimic adhesion to distinct ECM proteins. This would enable us to eliminate any possible contributions of other integrins expressed within our K562 system. Using multiple assays we determined that 7G2 and LIBS-1, surprisingly both LIBS type antibodies, mimic αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn and Fn, respectively. As seen with adhesion to Vn or Fn (Fig. 6 A), adhesion to anti-β3 mAb 7G2 and LIBS-1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in Kαvβ3 cells (Fig. 6 B). To further analyze 7G2 and LIBS-1, we employed adhesion assays to screen anti-β3 antibodies as possible ligand mimetics of Vn and Fn. Interestingly, we find that both Kαvβ3and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells bind to LIBS-1 without the need for cellular PKC activation (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, Kαvβ3 cells need cellular PKC activation to establish strong adhesion to 7G2, and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F are unable to adhere to 7G2 even in the presence of cellular PKC activation (Fig. 7,A and B). PKC-induced adhesion of Kαvβ3 cells to 7G2 was inhibited by C3 exoenzyme (100 nm) and wortmannin (10 μm). As seen with adhesion of these cells to Vn, this suggests a role for Rho and PI3K in PMA-induced adhesion of Kαvβ3cells to 7G2. In addition, adhesion of Kαvβ3 cells to LIBS-1 is also inhibited by C3 exoenzyme (100 nm) (Fig. 7 A), but adhesion is unaffected by pretreatment with wortmannin (10 μm), suggesting, as seen with adhesion to Fn, that PI3K is not required for adhesion. Fig. 7 B shows that Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells are incapable of adhering to 7G2 even in the presence of PMA. Additionally, Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells display inhibited adhesion to LIBS-1 in the presence of C3 exoenzyme (100 nm) but not wortmannin (10 μm), also suggesting a role for Rho, but not PI3K. Table I shows that both Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells express β3 equally, and both 7G2 and LIBS-1 bind equally in an RGD-dependent fashion, thus confirming that any lack of adhesion to Vn or 7G2 by Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells is not due to a lack of expression of the mutant β3integrin. Table I also shows that PI3K is uninvolved in the conformation-dependent recognition of β3 by either 7G2 or LIBS-1, as anti-β3 reactivity is unchanged in the presence of wortmannin. In this study we show that Rho is constitutively active on a Fn substrate but requires a cellular agonist such as PMA and active PI3K to become active on Vn. Rho is also found to be constitutively active in Kαvβ3 or Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells adherent to LIBS-1 (Fig. 8). However, as seen with Vn, there is an absolute requirement for cellular PKC activation before Rho activation occurs in Kαvβ3 on 7G2, and no Rho activity was detected in Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells even after PMA treatment. Taken together these data indicate that αvβ3-mediated adhesion to 7G2 and LIBS-1 mimic αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn and Fn, respectively. This fact will enable us to further decipher signaling events downstream of αvβ3 adhesion to specific ligands with no input from other integrins.Figure 7Selective inhibition of αvβ3-mediated adhesion to anti-β3 antibodies.

The ability of integrins, including αvβ3, to adhere to multiple ECM proteins has prompted the use of the term “promiscuous.” However, this term may be inaccurate because we and others show that αvβ3-mediated adhesion to distinct ligands is differentially regulated (4Boettiger D. Lynch L. Blystone S. Huber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31684-31690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 2: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cells and leukocytes in particular are able to regulate their adhesive properties, a requirement for appropriate vascular egress of leukocytes and subsequent extravascular immune surveillance (2Weerasinghe D. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Brown E.J. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 595-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Integrin activation can be defined as the events necessary to permit firm adhesion, including a possible enhancement of integrin affinity, avidity, and integrin-cytoskeletal interactions. A requirement for β3-tyrosine phosphorylation during αvβ3 activation has been established; however, the mechanism and the circumstances under which this modification contributes to the overall activation state of αvβ3 have not been have not been completely established (5Boettiger D.

In this study we show that αvβ3-mediated firm adhesion to distinct ECM ligands initiates unique signaling pathways and distinct cellular phenotypes. We show that αvβ3-mediated firm adhesion to Vn requires both cellular PKC activity and β3-tyrosine phosphorylation. Additionally, we show that firm adhesion to Vn also requires both PI3K and Syk activities. Furthermore, Rho activity is only up-regulated in cells adherent to Vn when there is coincident PKC and PI3K activities and tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. PI3K activity is up-regulated after adhesion to Vn, but not Fn, and PI3K translocation to αvβ3 complexes occurs only with tyrosine-phosphorylated β3. In contrast, αvβ3-mediated firm adhesion to Fn results in or in fact may be a result of constitutive Rho activation that requires no cellular PKC activation, β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, or PI3K activity. These data clearly outline distinct signaling pathways that are involved in αvβ3 activation by and subsequent adhesion to distinct ligands. Parallel results using ligand mimetic anti-β3 mAbs validate the single integrin-multiple pathway conclusion. The unique behavior of the anti-β3mAb 7G2 indicates that the signaling pathway utilized by αvβ3 adhesion to Vn defines the leukocyte response integrin, a β3-related integrin of neutrophils originally characterized using this mAb. These mAb data support our hypothesis that β3-tyrosine phosphorylation and the mechanisms dependent upon this modification are likely to be a hematopoietic cell-specific event. If this conclusion is correct, a role exists for CD47 co-characterized with leukocyte response integrin in αvβ3 function that has not yet been determined. The role for CD47 in αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Vn is perhaps related to the recruitment of a greater complexity of signaling molecules than is required for αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn or its mimetic mAb LIBS-1. The ECM is composed of multiple proteins that serve as ligands for integrins expressed on a variety of cells. The ability of specific integrins to adhere to distinct ligands in a regulated manner may be a fundamental part of the regulated adhesion required for hematopoietic cell function. Many reports have shown distinct phenotypes resulting from different integrins recognizing a single substrate (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Here we show that distinct phenotypes can also result from a single integrin recognizing different substrates. This would allow hematopoietic cells to use distinct ligands for discrete steps in the processes of arresting from the vasculature, transendothelial migration, and migration within the ECM to the site of inflammation. Although αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn or Vn can both ultimately result in firm adhesion, the activation of distinct signaling pathways would allow for the initiation of additional cellular functions specific to an immediate cellular challenge such as transendothelial migration. The ability of cells to firmly adhere to multiple ECM proteins requires regulated integrin ligation and initiation of specific subsequent signaling pathways that ultimately lead to an actin cytoskeletal reorganization that supports firm adhesion, and integrin activation is a critical step in this process. Integrin activation can be defined as the process by which integrin ligation leads to actin cytoskeletal reorganization via Rho activity and consequent firm adhesion. By this definition we can utilize active GTP-bound Rho as a biochemical marker of an activated integrin complex. Here we show that distinct ligands can initiate two modes of integrin activation that lead to Rho activation and firm adhesion employing different signaling components downstream of integrin ligation. Integrin activation on Vn is highly regulated and requires β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, cellular PKC activity, PI3K activity, and Syk activity, which ultimately lead to Rho activation and stress fiber formation. In contrast, adhesion to Fn does not require β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, cellular PKC activity, or PI3K activity; however, firm adhesion to both ligands requires Rho activity. Although the Syk inhibitor piceatannol blocks RGD-induced phosphorylation of β3, it is unlikely that this is the mechanism whereby piceatannol inhibits αvβ3-mediated adhesion to Fn, because this event is independent of β3-tyrosine phosphorylation and yet inhibited by piceatannol. In contrast to another report, we find that wortmannin has no effect on RGD-induced β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, and therefore, its inhibitory effects are likely due to inhibition of the increase in PI3K activity and/or the translocation of PI3K to the integrin complex (22Bruyninckx W.J. Comerford K.M. Lawrence D.W. Colgan S.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 3251-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we do not find an effect of wortmannin on the RGD-induced conformational change of αvβ3 (23Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11358-11366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This correlates with our previous reports showing the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 for Vn adhesion, shown here to be PI3K-dependent, is unrelated to the conformation change in the receptor after ligand binding. Although the need for ligand-dependent pathways of cytoskeletal reorganization remains to be determined, our data suggest that these signaling pathways converge at the level of a RhoGEF. One potential scenario involves PKC-dependent activation of Src causing Pyk2 activation and translocation to the integrin complex. This simplistic path provides neither a role for PI3K activity or its translocation to the integrin unless it functions to recruit the RhoGEF or Syk. It is also possible that PI3K is required for the activation of Src. The requirement of Syk activity in both pathways probably implicates Vav as the RhoGEF responsible for Rho activation. In cells adherent to Fn or LIBS-1, Rho activation may result from direct αvβ3 association with and auto-activation of Syk as previously described (24Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Leng L. Wilsbacher J.L. Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1799-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This determination will require additional reagents specific for active Vav. Of equal interest is the ability of Fn ligation of αvβ3 to up-regulate Rho without the need for β3-tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3K activity, or PKC activity. It has been reported that β3-tyrosine phosphorylation can be a negative regulator of Fn adhesion; thus, it seems likely that the recruitment of a αvβ3 binding partner in a β3-tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner is responsible for the initiation of these distinct signaling pathways. The nature of the proximal binding partner is most likely that of an adapter molecule, although we cannot rule out that PI3K may bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 integrins. Identification of this proximal binding partner will permit further discrimination of the signaling events initiated by αvβ3 after attachment to Vn or Fn. Furthermore, the Rho activation, firm adhesion, and stress fiber formation seen in Kαvβ3Y747F,Y759F cells adherent to fibronectin argues that these cytoplasmic tyrosine mutations selectively target signaling pathways and do not grossly disturb the functional structure of the receptor. Our description of distinct signaling pathways resulting from different ligand recognition by the same integrin provides an additional level of ligand discrimination and integrin regulation. Whether this is unique to hematopoietic cell types remains to be determined; however, these cell types are the most in need of self-regulated adhesion. Related phenomena such as tumor metastasis may utilize similar signaling pathways. The characterization of ligand-mimetic mAb, which also initiate unique signaling, will advance future study of this integrin behavior in cell types with complex integrin expression patterns."

A retroviral library of randomly fragmented normalized cDNA from mouse fibroblasts was screened for GSEs capable of protecting NIH3T3 cells from TNF-induced apoptosis. The most abundant among isolated GSEs represented a fragment of cDNA encoding the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the immunoglobulin family inhibitory receptor, SHPS-1 (mouse homologue of human SIRPα). Ectopic expression of this fragment (both from human and mouse versions) increased the NF-κB-dependent transcription in three cell lines tested; this effect could be reduced by the expression of full-length SIRPα, suggesting that the isolated GSE acts through a dominant negative mechanism. GSE-mediated activation of NF-κB depended on the presence of serum, was abrogated by wortmannin, and was associated with phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, suggesting that Akt mediates it.

Han J. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2001; 4: 79-90Google Scholar). In combination with inhibitors of transcription or translation, TNF can induce apoptosis in sensitive cells in cell culture. This apoptosis is initiated by binding TNF to its plasma membrane receptors, which belong to the death receptor family. After death receptors have been triggered, the adaptor molecules, including FADD and TRADD and the receptor proximal caspase 8, are engaged to form a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Upon recruitment to the DISC, caspase 8 becomes activated and mediates cleavage of procaspase 3, starting a chain of events that results in apoptotic death (2Petak I. Houghton J.A. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2001; 7: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The key role played by TNF pathway in many pathological processes indicates the importance of its control by pharmacological approaches (3Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Rational design of such approaches requires identification of cellular factors involved in regulation of TNF-mediated death, some of which have been already determined. Pro-apoptotic function of TNF can be counterbalanced by simultaneous activation of anti-apoptotic NF-κB pathway, which can effectively prevent initiation of a death cascade through transcriptional induction of a number of apoptosis inhibitors (4Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). NF-κB is functionally linked to Akt signaling pathway, an important sensor of environmental conditions (i.e.availability of growth factors) strongly contributing to the “to die or not to die” decision. It can greatly reduce suicidal intentions of the cell in the presence of growth factors and other ligands specific to healthy growth conditions and natural microenvironments (5Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). The signaling from phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to the protein kinase Akt is an evolutionary conserved ancient pathway that controls organism life span in invertebrates and cell survival and proliferation in mammals (6Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many cell-surface receptors induce production of second messengers, like phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), that convey signals to the cytoplasm from the cell surface. PIP3 signals activate 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, which in turn activates the kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B. Akt promotes cell survival and opposes apoptosis by a variety of routes, including the activation of NF-κB through phosphorylation of inhibitory κB kinase (7Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). Both NF-κB and Akt signaling are integrated into a network of cellular regulatory pathways through numerous components, only some of which have been identified. To determine new regulators of TNF apoptotic pathway, we used the genetic suppressor elements (GSE) approach, a functional genetic methodology designed for cloning genes associated with recessive phenotypes (8Gudkov A.V. Kazarov A.R. Thimmapaya R. Axenovich S.A. Mazo I.A. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3744-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Gudkov A.V. Roninson I.B.

It was successfully used before for identification of genes involved in negative control of cell growth, including drug sensitivity and candidate tumor suppressor genes (8Gudkov A.V. Kazarov A.R.

Goldfinger N. Peles E. Gudkov A.V. Rotter V. Oncogene. 2002; 2: 6713-6721Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). GSEs act by encoding either inhibitory antisense RNA or dominant negative truncated proteins. They are isolated from expression libraries of randomly fragmented cDNAs by functional selection. GSEs suppressing TNF-induced apoptosis would likely be derived from and act against the genes that could be important for TNF-mediated death and therefore can be used for identification and cloning. Among genetic elements protecting cells from TNF-specific apoptosis, we isolated a GSE that encoded the cytoplasmic part of the inhibitory receptor SHPS1 (the mouse homologue of human SIRPα) (13Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 14Veillette A. Thibaudeau E. Latour S. J. Biol.

Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 87: 961-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These phosphatases are known to be involved in cytoplasmic signaling downstream of a variety of cell surface receptors and to be capable of modulating NF-κB (16You M. Flick L.M., Yu, D. Feng G.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In fact, ectopic expression of SHPS-1/SIRPα-derived GSE resulted in a strong Akt-dependent activation of NF-κB that is likely to be responsible for the GSE-mediated TNF resistance. Overexpression of full-length SHPS-1/SIRPα protein caused effects opposite to that of the GSE, indicating that the isolated element acts through a dominant negative mechanism. These observations suggest that SHPS-1/SIRPα is a natural negative regulator of NF-κB signaling, presumably involved in the control of cell response to a variety of stimuli acting through this important pathway.

Retroviral infection was accomplished by transferring virus-containing medium supplemented with 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). The preparation of the GSE library from poly(A)+ RNA of NIH3T3 cells was previously described (8Gudkov A.V. Kazarov A.R. Thimmapaya R. Axenovich S.A. Mazo I.A. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Synthetic adapters providing initiator codons upstream of the insert in all reading frames flank each fragment. GSEs were isolated from selected cells by RT-PCR and recloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. GSE2–1 and GSESIRP, representing the entire C-terminal part of SHSP1/SIRPα, were synthesized by RT-PCR from total RNA of NIH3T3 and HeLa cells, respectively, using 5′-GAATTCTGCAACCATGGAACAG-3′ sense and 5′-GGATCCATCACTTCCTCTGGACCT-3′ antisense primers for GSE2–1 and 5′-GAATTCTCGCAACCATGGGACAG-3′ sense and 5′-GGATCCATCACTTCCTCGGGACCTG-3′ antisense primers for GSESIRP. The targeted mutagenesis, which converted tyrosines to phenylalanines codons, was done by PCR. For functional testing, all the generated fragments were cloned into pLXSN retroviral expression vector, also conferring G418 resistance. The complete coding region of full-length SIRPα cDNA was recloned from Expressed Sequence Tag accession numbers AI357578 and BE514786 into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). cDNA for the S32A/S36A mutant of IkBα (super-repressor mutant form of IkB) in pBabePuro expression vector was a gift from Dr. S.

The virus-containing medium from transfected cells was transferred on 2 × 106 NIH3T3 amphotropic packaging cells followed by G418 selection. 5 × 105 G418-resistant NIH3T3 amphotropic cells per plate were treated with TNF (0.01 ng/ml) in the presence of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHI). Virus-containing medium from the cells that survived TNF treatment (8–10% of the infected population) was transferred to 2 × 106 NIH3T3 ecotropic packaging cells that were subjected to the second round of selection. We alternated amphotropic and ecotropic packaging cells in this screening to improve the efficiency of infection with retroviruses (ecotropic packaging cells are resistant to infection with ecotropic virus, as amphotropic packaging cells are to amphotropic virus). The last round of selection was done on NIH3T3 cells that are more sensitive to TNF than packaging cell lines. After 3–4 rounds of selection, a significant increase in the proportion of TNF-resistant cells was observed in the population infected by the library-carrying but not in control insert-free virus. Library inserts from NIH3T3 cells surviving after TNF/CHI treatment were isolated by RT-PCR, using two subsequent PCR reactions with two sets of nested primers to increase specificity of the GSE rescue. The first round of PCR was done with primers specific to the pLNCX vector sequences flanking the inserts, 5′-CCAAGCTTTGTTTACATCGATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGGCGTTAACTTAAGCTGCTT-3′ (antisense), followed with the second PCR that involved the sense-oriented strand of the adapter 5′-AATCATCGATGGATGGATGG-3′. The efficiency of NF-κB transcriptional activity was estimated using reporter plasmid containing minimal promoter of the c-fos gene (20Foos G. Garcia-Ramirez J.J. Galang C.K. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18871-18880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) combined with two oligonucleotides corresponding to NF-κB-binding sites from human immune deficiency virus long terminal repeat (21Paya C.V. Ten R.M. Bessia C. Alcami J. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7826-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection in luciferase assay experiments was estimated by β-galactosidase expression from a co-transfected pcDNA3-lacZ plasmid, and the results of luciferase assays were normalized accordingly. Total protein extracts from 2 × 106 293 cells expressing full-length SIRPα, GSE2–1, GSESIRP, and GSE1FSIRP proteins in 50 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH8.0, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) with the protease inhibitor mixture (SIGMA) were separated by electrophoresis in 4–20% precast polyacrylamide gels with SDS (Novex) and transferred to nylon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes Hybond P (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Biosciences) after incubation with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-SIRPα/SHPS-1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). For Akt phosphorylation analysis, 2 × 106 293 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 125 μm sodium ortovanadate (inhibitor of protein phosphatases) (all from Sigma). Protein concentrations in supernatants were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 40 μg of each protein sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis 4–20% and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal phospho-Akt (Ser473) primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) or, for quantitation, goat polyclonal anti-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and anti-goat antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the membrane was developed with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantitation of the data was performed using Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. The scheme explaining the screening of the retroviral GSE library of normalized fragmented cDNA of NIH3T3 is shown in Fig. 1 A and is fully addressed under “Experimental Procedures.” 2 × 106library-producing NIH3T3-derived packaging cells sensitive to TNF were treated with TNF in the presence of inhibitor of translation CHI under conditions that resulted in killing >90% of the cells. After expansion of the surviving population, virus produced by these cells (and presumably enriched in clones conferring TNF resistance) was transferred to another type of packaging cells permissive for the infection with the isolated virus, and treatment was repeated. Up to four rounds of selection were applied before virus transfer became evidently capable of conferring TNF resistance to NIH3T3 cells as compared with control vector virus subjected to the same selection procedure (20–25% versus 2–3% of TNF-resistant cells among infected NIH3T3). At this stage, selected GSE inserts isolated by RT-PCR were recloned and sequenced. 40% of all rescued GSE clones in one of the lines of screening contained the same sequence, named GSE2. The proportion of this sequence, undetectable in the original GSE population before TNF selection, gradually increased with each next round of selection, as determined by Southern blot hybridization of PCR products of the mixture of cDNA GSE inserts isolated by PCR at different stages of screening (Fig. 1 B). This GSE was subjected to a more detailed analysis. Sequence analysis of GSE2 showed that it represents a sense-oriented fragment of cDNA encoding a cytoplasmic part of a known protein, inhibitory receptor SHPS-1 (accession number NM007547). (The human homologue is named signal regulatory protein α or SIRPα). The SHPS-1/SIRPα corresponding open reading frame in GSE2 starts from the second initiator codon of the adapter and encodes 99 amino acid residues from the cytoplasmic part of SHPS-1, with the exception of the very C-terminal part that includes the last C-terminal tyrosine site for phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). Structurally, SHPS-1/SIRPα belongs to the immunoglobulin family of receptors. When activated by Src-mediated phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue, SHPS-1/SIRPα can affect the signaling pathways between epidermal growth factor receptor and PI3K (22Wu C.J. Chen Z. Ullrich A. Greene M.I. O'Rourke D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) through binding the SH2-domain containing phosphotyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. No connection has been reported so far between SHPS-1/SIRPα and TNF-dependent apoptosis. GSE2 in the selected clone was in sense orientation and could potentially express the majority of the cytoplasmic part of SHPS-1/SIRPα if translated from the second ATG codon of the adapter. However, two other start codons in alternative frames could, in principle, initiate the translation of SHPS-1/SIRPα-unrelated peptides, which could be responsible for the observed effect. To rule out this possibility, we modified the GSE2 sequence to eliminate two alternative initiator codons and cloned it into another retroviral vector (pLXSN) under the control of the long terminal repeat promoter. In parallel, we synthesized by RT-PCR and cloned into the same vector the fragment of SHPS-1/SIRPα cDNA that encodes the entire C-terminal region of the protein, supplying it with the initiator ATG codon (GSE2–1) (Fig. 1 C). All these constructs, including insert-free vector, were converted into retroviruses by transfection of packaging cells and transduced into two mouse cell lines (NIH3T3 and A4) that were then tested for TNF resistance. Only GSE2 and GSE2–1 efficiently protected the infected cells from TNF-specific apoptosis (Fig. 2). Cells infected with GSE2–1 in antisense orientation showed the same sensitivity to TNF as the cells infected with empty pLXSN vector and the original cells. No difference in the potency of TNF protection was found between GSE2 and GSE2–1, indicating that the last tyrosine of SHPS-1/SIRPα, which was reported to be important for SHPS-1/SIRPα function (23Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H. Fukunaga K. Noguchi T. Fujioka Y. Okazaki I. Tsuda M. Yamao T. Ochi F. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9234-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is dispensable in the GSE activity. Thus, biological activity of the isolated GSE is indeed the function of the C-terminal fragment of SHPS-1/SIRPα protein expression. TNF is known to stimulate activation of NF-κB possessing pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions (24Georganas C. Liu H. Perlman H. Hoffmann A. Thimmapaya B. Pope R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7199-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation by TNF and platelet-derived growth factor requires Akt serine-threonine kinase (26Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 27Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). SIRPα was reported to have negative regulatory effects on cellular responses to growth factors (13Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and to inhibit EGF-induced PI3K activation (22Wu C.J. Chen Z. Ullrich A. Greene M.I. O'Rourke D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because SIRPα affects the PI3K/Akt pathway, we speculated that it can modulate TNF signaling through Akt-dependent NF-κB activation. To test this hypothesis we analyzed NF-κB activity in the cells overexpressing GSE2–1 and full-length SIRPα, using specific reporter constructs expressing NF-κB-dependent luciferase. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 3 A. They show that GSE2–1 stimulates basal activity of NF-κB up to 8 times. At the same time, overexpression of the full-length SIRPα protein had the effect opposite to that of the GSE, causing a decrease in the activity of NF-κB (Fig. 3 A). Neither construct had any effect on the expression of luciferase reporter with minimal promoter (data not shown). The mutated form of IκB known as “super-repressor,” which can effectively inhibit NF-κB transcriptional activity at the step of translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (19Miagkov A.V. Kovalenko D.V. Brown C.E. Didsbury J.R. Cogswell J.P. Stimpson S.A. Baldwin A.S. Makarov S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13859-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), has often been used to prove the NF-κB-specificity of the studied effects (19Miagkov A.V. Kovalenko D.V. Brown C.E. Didsbury J.R. Cogswell J.P. Stimpson S.A. Baldwin A.S. Makarov S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13859-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 27Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). We expressed the super-repressor form of IκB in combination with GSE2–1 and found that it can neutralize the NF-κB-activating effect of the GSE as well as the activation of NF-κB by TNF (Fig. 3 B). The activity of full-length SIRPα depends on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic part of the protein by Src tyrosine kinase (13Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar); only the phosphorylated form of SIRPα can bind SHP-1 and -2 protein phosphatases (13Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 22Wu C.J. Chen Z. Ullrich A. Greene M.I. O'Rourke D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We checked whether this phosphorylation is crucial to the NF-κB-inducing activity of the cytoplasmic fragment of SHPS-1/SIRPα. In these experiments we used the construct expressing the human homologue, named GSESIRP, of mouse GSE2–1 that has a similar biological effect on NF-κB. Substitution of tyrosine for phenylalanine within the consensus of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (V/IXYXXV/L) decreased the ability of GSE1FSIRP to activate NF-κB in all cell lines tested (Fig. 4). The mutation form of GSE with three tyrosines changed for phenylalanines completely lost the ability to activate NF-κB (data not shown). It is noteworthy that all the versions of GSE2 and GSESIRP were expressed in our experiments at a level comparable with those of endogenous SHPS-1/SIRPα, whereas ectopic expression of full-length constructs resulted in high levels of SHPS-1/SIRPα that significantly exceeded the level of endogenous protein (Fig. 3 C). Expression of the cytoplasmic portion of SHPS-1/SIRPα protected cells against TNF-induced apoptosis, presumably through its ability to activate NF-κB. On the contrary, ectopic expression of full-length SHPS-1/SIRPα makes cells more sensitive to TNF-stimulated apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). This effect was stronger in HeLa than in NIH3T3 cells because of higher sensitivity of NIH3T3 cells to TNF-specific apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). Consistently, full-length SHPS-1/SIRPα caused an inhibitory effect on NF-κB activity (Fig. 3 A). These observations suggested that the cytoplasmic portion of SHPS-1/SIRPα acts as a dominant negative mutant. In fact, cotransfection of cells with different ratios of plasmids encoding truncated and full-length versions of SHPS-1/SIRPα showed that the excess of full-length SHPS-1/SIRPα decreased the ability of GSE2–1 to activate NF-κB (Fig. 5 B). GSE2–1 did not stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcription in serum-free medium in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 6 A), suggesting the involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling in the GSE activity. We used wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K kinase (26Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), to analyze whether GSE2–1 indeed needs PI3K/Akt to activate NF-κB. Cells were transfected and maintained in serum-free medium overnight. An additional 10% of fetal calf serum activated NF-κB-mediated transcription of the reporter, and the expression of GSE2–1 had an additive effect (Fig. 6 A). Wortmannin completely inhibited NF-κB-mediated transcription caused both by addition of growth factors and by GSE2–1 (Fig. 6 A). The inhibition of PI3K activity suppresses phosphorylation of Akt (26Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). We analyzed the ability of GSE2–1 to regulate phosphorylation of Akt using antibodies specific to the phosphorylated form of Akt. In 293 cells growing in serum-free medium overnight, the medium was changed to serum-free every 30 min 4 times before protein extraction to avoid contamination with 293 cells-secreted factors. The treatment of these cells with 10% fetal serum for 30 min significantly increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). The GSE2–1 transiently transfected cells (60 to 70% of cells were transfected) in fetal serum containing medium showed additional increase of Akt phosphorylation. Treatment of the cells with TNF had an effect on Akt phosphorylation similar to GSE2–1 expression (Fig. 6 B). Expression of GSE2–1 did not protect Akt phosphorylation from the inhibitory activity of wortmannin (Fig. 6 B). In our search for GSEs protecting cells against TNF-induced apoptosis, we isolated a genetic element encoding the cytoplasmic part of an already known protein, SHPS-1/SIRPα. The isolated GSE protected cells from TNF and strongly induced transcriptional activity of NF-κB in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. Because NF-κB is known to protect cells from TNF, GSE-mediated activation of this transcription factor is presumably responsible for the inhibition of TNF-mediated apoptosis. Full-length SHPS-1/SIRPα shows effects opposite to those of the isolated GSE, suggesting that the GSE-encoded truncated form of this protein acts through a dominant negative mechanism, interfering with the function of the full-length protein. What is the mechanism linking SHPS-1/SIRPα to NF-κB? The PI3K/Akt pathway is important for NF-κB activation by TNF (26Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 28Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27740-27744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Activated Akt phosphorylates the IKKβ complex, which phosphorylates NF-κB inhibitor IκB and stimulates its degradation (29Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar), which leads to a release of NF-κB that accumulates in the nucleus and activates transcription of the target genes. The functional connection of SIRPα with the PI3K/Akt pathway was shown. Overexpression of SIRPα, but not of its tyrosineless mutant form, inhibits PI3K activation and stimulation of proliferation by growth factors (13Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 22Wu C.J. Chen Z. Ullrich A. Greene M.I. O'Rourke D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the contrary, ectopic expression of the cytoplasmic portion of SHPS1/SIRPα stimulates growth factor-dependent Akt phosphorylation. NF-κB activation seems to be the result of this effect because it was completely suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Importantly, this effect of the GSE-encoded truncated protein was also dependent on the presence of tyrosine residues. These observations are consistent with the hypothetical model that the truncated dominant negative form of SHPS1/SIRPα competes with the full-length membrane-bound protein for some factors that are bound to these proteins in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. There are two proteins belonging to the same family that are known to bind with SHPS1/SIRPα and mediate its biological functions, tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and -2 (15Sharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 87: 961-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). SHPS1/SIRPα can bind both proteins when its own tyrosine residues in ITIM signals are phosphorylated with Src (13Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 14Veillette A. Thibaudeau E. Latour S. J. Biol.

Despite significant homology between SHP-1 and -2, these proteins have opposite effects on cell viability. SHP-1 is pro-apoptotic and can suppress cell growth (34Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Leber B.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, SHP-2 has an anti-apoptotic effect (38Hideshima T. Nakamura N. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5991-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), stimulating Akt activation by growth factors (16You M. Flick L.M., Yu, D. Feng G.S. J. Exp.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6018-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); its absence inhibits NF-κB activation by TNF (16You M. Flick L.M., Yu, D. Feng G.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity is increased in cells from the Mev strain of mice deficient in SHP-1 (33Massa P.T. Wu C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The opposite biological effect is associated with SHP-2 gene deficiency (16You M. Flick L.M., Yu, D. Feng G.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is linked to NF-κB through modulation of PI3K/Akt signaling. It causes dephosphorylation of tyrosine 688 inside the N-terminal SH2 domain of the regulatory subunit of PI3K p85 that turns it into an inhibitor of the catalytic subunit p110 (40Cuevas B.D., Lu, Y. Mao M. Zhang J. LaPushin R. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27455-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 41Cuevas B., Lu, Y. Watt S. Kumar R. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27583-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The depletion of SHP-1 by the GSE-encoded cytoplasmic portion of SHPS-1/SIRPα might lead to the activation of the p110 subunit of PI3K and phosphorylation of Akt. Thus, dephosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K might be one of the mechanisms through which dominant negative SHPS-1/SIRPα could activate NF-κB and promote TNF resistance. However, in our experiments GSE2 caused only a slight increase in the level of Akt phosphorylation in 293 cells, making it unlikely that this effect is solely responsible for the dramatic activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. There could be additional targets for GSE2 downstream of Akt that remain to be identified. Although the function of SHP-1 is consistent with the observed biological effects, the role of SHP-2 in our model remains less defined. There are contradictory reports on the activity of this phosphatase. There is evidence indicating that inactivation of SHP-2 decreases the transactivating abilities of NF-κB in response to interleukin 1 (16You M. Flick L.M., Yu, D. Feng G.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). At the same time, other reports claim that inactivation of SHP-2 increases the PI3K-dependent Akt activation with EGF (42Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4062-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and that cooperation of SIRPα and SHP-2 had a negative effect on EGF-specific activation of PI3K (22Wu C.J. Chen Z. Ullrich A. Greene M.I. O'Rourke D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). According to these data, the functions of the two phosphatases are similar and titration of SHP-2 by GSE2 could also stimulate EGF/PI3K-dependent activation of NF-κB. This apparent controversy has to be resolved in future experiments. In summary, the biological effects of full-length SHPS-1/SIRPα can be explained through its ability to bind and compartmentalize SHP-1, and possibly SHP-2, with growth factor receptors causing their inactivation. We hypothesize that GSE-encoded proteins act as scavengers of SHP-1 and -2 in the cell, affecting proper targeting of these phosphatases to plasma membrane and thereby interfering with their inhibitory activity against growth factor-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2045651022,"Synaptotagmin IV (Syt IV) is a fourth member of the Syt family and has been shown to regulate some forms of memory and learning by analysis of Syt IV null mutant mice (Ferguson, G. D., Anagnostaras, S. G., Silva, A. J., and Herschman, H. R. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 5598–5603). However, the involvement of Syt IV protein in vesicular trafficking and even its localization in secretory vesicles are still matters of controversy. Here we present several lines of evidence showing that the Syt IV protein in PC12 cells is normally localized in the Golgi or immature vesicles at the cell periphery and is sorted to fusion-competent mature dense-core vesicles in response to short nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation. (i) In undifferentiated PC12 cells, Syt IV protein is mainly localized in the Golgi and small amounts are also present at the cell periphery, but according to the results of an immunocytochemical analysis, they do not colocalize with conventional secretory vesicle markers (Syt I, Syt IX, Rab3A, Rab27A, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2, and synaptophysin) at all. By contrast, limited colocalization of Syt IV protein with dense-core vesicle markers is found in the distal parts of the neurites of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. (ii) Immunoelectron microscopy with highly specific anti-Syt IV antibody revealed that the Syt IV protein in undifferentiated PC12 cells is mainly present on the Golgi membranes and immature secretory vesicles, whereas after NGF stimulation Syt IV protein is also present on the mature dense-core vesicles. (iii) An N-terminal antibody-uptake experiment indicated that Syt IV-containing vesicles in the neurites of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, whereas no uptake of the anti-Syt IV-N antibody was observed in undifferentiated PC12 cells. Our results suggest that Syt IV is a stimulus (e.g. NGF)-dependent regulator for exocytosis of dense-core vesicles. Synaptotagmin IV (Syt IV) is a fourth member of the Syt family and has been shown to regulate some forms of memory and learning by analysis of Syt IV null mutant mice (Ferguson, G.

(iii) An N-terminal antibody-uptake experiment indicated that Syt IV-containing vesicles in the neurites of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, whereas no uptake of the anti-Syt IV-N antibody was observed in undifferentiated PC12 cells. Our results suggest that Syt IV is a stimulus (e.g. NGF)-dependent regulator for exocytosis of dense-core vesicles. synaptotagmin(s) nerve growth factor phosphate buffer vesicle-associated membrane protein solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors Synaptotagmin (Syt)1 is a family of C-terminal-type (C-type) tandem C2 proteins with an N-terminal single transmembrane domain and is thought to regulate membrane traffic (reviewed in Refs. 1Fukuda M.

However, the precise subcellular localizations and functions of other Syt isoforms (Syts III–XIII) are still a matter of controversy (see Discussions in Refs. 23Saegusa C. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J.

Syt IV was first described as a fourth member of the Syt family (25Hilbush B.S. Morgan J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8195-8199Google Scholar), and the syt IV gene was subsequently identified as an immediate early gene induced by membrane depolarization in brain and in PC12 cells (26Vician L. Lim I.K.

Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 425-435Google Scholar) and rapidly changes in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli (31Tocco G., Bi, X. Vician L. Lim I.K. Herschman H. Baudry M. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 229-239Google Scholar, 32Denovan-Wright E.M. Newton R.A. Armstrong J.N. Babity J.M. Robertson H.A. Mol. Brain. Res. 1998; 55: 350-354Google Scholar, 33Glavan G. Zorec R. Babic K.

Stroke. 2001; 32: 168-174Google Scholar). Since Syt IV null mutant mice exhibit abnormalities in motor performance and some forms of memory related to the hipoccampus (36Ferguson G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Silva A.J. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5598-5603Google Scholar), it has been suggested that Syt IV protein is crucial to learning and memory (or synaptic plasticity) (28Ferguson G.D. Vician L. Herschman H.R. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 23: 173-185Google Scholar, 37Ibata K. Hashikawa T. Tsuboi T. Terakawa S. Liang F. Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 401-406Google Scholar). However, the role of Syt IV on the molecular level during learning and memory and its involvement in vesicular trafficking remain to be elucidated. Although Syt IV protein was first proposed to be a synaptic vesicle protein and function in concert with Syt I (38Ferguson G.D. Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. Herschman H.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1821-1831Google Scholar, 39Littleton J.T. Serano T.L. Rubin G.M. Ganetzky B. Chapman E.R. Nature. 1999; 400: 757-760Google Scholar, 40Thomas D.M. Ferguson G.D. Herschman H.R. Elferink L.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2285-2295Google Scholar), recent subcellular fractionation studies and immunoelectron microscopy have clearly demonstrated that rather than being a synaptic vesicle protein, Syt IV is present on uncharacterized vesicular/organelle structures in both axons and dendrites and in the Golgi of developing mouse brain (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 37Ibata K. Hashikawa T. Tsuboi T. Terakawa S. Liang F. Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Neurosci.

Perinuclear localization of Syt IV protein and distinct subcellular localizations of Syts I and IV have also been observed in some endocrine cells (PC12, pituitary AtT-20, and pancreatic α-cells) (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 42Eaton B.A. Haugwitz M. Lau D. Moore H.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7334-7344Google Scholar, 43Gut A. Kiraly C.E. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. Lang J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1709-1716Google Scholar). In addition, Syt IV protein has been shown to be localized on immature vesicles rather than mature secretory vesicles in AtT-20 cells, suggesting a role of Syt IV protein as a keeper of the switch for the change from unregulated to regulated secretory vesicles (42Eaton B.A. Haugwitz M. Lau D. Moore H.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7334-7344Google Scholar). Whether endogenous Syt IV-containing vesicles/organelles fuse plasma membrane in response to Ca2+, however, had never been determined despite this information being important to learning whether Syt IV acts as a positive regulator or negative regulator of exocytosis. In this study, we observed a nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent redistribution of Syt IV protein in PC12 cells and discovered that NGF stimulates the sorting of Syt IV protein to mature dense-core vesicles that undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Based on our findings, we discuss the distinct roles of Syt I and Syt IV in secretory vesicle trafficking in the brain. The anti-Syt I mouse monoclonal antibody (SYA148) was from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The anti-Syt IX-C2A, anti-Syt IX-N, and anti-Syt IV-C2A rabbit polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described previously (21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar, 27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar). The antibody specific for the N-terminal domain of the mouse Syt IV (anti-Syt IV-N) was raised against the following synthetic peptide with a C-terminal artificial Cys residue: MAPITTSRVEFDEC (Syt IV-N amino acids 1–14) (44Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Google Scholar). The antibody was affinity-purified by exposure to the antigenic peptide bound to FMP-activated Cellulofine (Seikagaku Co.) as described previously (44Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody was checked by immunoblotting with recombinant T7-tagged Syts I–XIII expressed in COS-7 cells (21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar, 22Zhang X. Kim-Miller M.J. Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, immunoblotting did not reveal any evidence of cross-reactivity between the anti-Syt IV-N antibody and other Syt isoforms including with closely related isoform Syt XI (46von Poser C. Ichtchenko K. Shao X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14314-14319Google Scholar) (data not shown). The protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a reference. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Google Scholar). The purified anti-Syt IV-N and anti-Syt IX-N antibodies were conjugated with carboxytetramethylrhodamine and carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (11Mikoshiba K. Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Llinás R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10703-10707Google Scholar, 47Sugimori M. Tong C.-K. Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. Llinás R. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 39-51Google Scholar). NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 10% fetal bovine serum on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) coated with collagen type IV (BD Biosciences Labware) (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 45Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Google Scholar). After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with low KCl buffer (5.6 mm KCl, 145 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) or high KCl buffer (56 mmKCl, 95 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) containing either the rhodamine-labeled anti-Syt IV-N or fluorescein-labeled anti-Syt IX-N antibodies (10 μg/ml) (8Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 249-257Google Scholar, 21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar, 23Saegusa C. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24499-24505Google Scholar). The cells were immediately washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer for 20 min at room temperature as described previously (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 45Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Google Scholar). Incorporated antibodies were directly analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (TE300, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) attached to a laser confocal scanner unit CSU 10 (Yokogawa Electric Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and HiSCA CCD camera (C6790, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) (21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar, 45Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Google Scholar) or a confocal fluorescence microscope (FluoView, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were pseudo-colored and superimposed with Adobe Photoshop software (version 7.0). The pre-embedding silver enhancement immunogold method was performed as described by Yoshimoriet al. (48Yoshimori T. Yamagata F. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Kabeya Y. Nara A. Miwako I. Ohashi M. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 747-763Google Scholar) with a slight modification. PC12 cells cultured on collagen type IV-coated plastic coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer (PB) (pH 7.4) for 2 h. The cells were washed in the buffer three times and were incubated for 30 min in PB containing 0.25% saponin and 5% bovine serum albumin and then for 30 min for blocking in PB containing 0.005% saponin, 10% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal goat serum, and 0.1% cold water fish skin gelatin. The cells were then exposed to the anti-Syt IV-C2A rabbit IgG (1/500 dilution) in the blocking solution overnight. After washing in PB containing 0.005% saponin six times for 10 min, cells were incubated with the Fab′ fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG that had been conjugated to colloidal gold (1.4-nm diameter) in the blocking solution for 2 h. The cells were then washed with PB six times for 10 min and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PB for 10 min. After washing, the gold labeling was intensified with a silver enhancement kit for 6 min at 20 °C in the dark. After washing in distilled water, the cells were postfixed in 0.5% OsO4 for 90 min at 4 °C, washed in distilled water, incubated with 50% ethanol for 10 min, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 1 h. The cells were further dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Immunocytochemical analysis of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells was also performed as described previously (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 45Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Google Scholar). Afterward, antibodies were used for immunocytochemical analysis: anti-Syt I (SYA148, 1/250 dilution,StressGen), anti-Syt IX (1/100 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-Rab3A (1/500 dilution, Transduction Laboratories), anti-Rab27A (1/100 dilution, Transduction Laboratories), anti-VAMP-2 (1/1000 dilution, Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), anti-synaptophysin mouse monoclonal antibodies (1/250 dilution, Sigma), and anti-Syt IV-C2A rabbit polyclonal antibody (1.5 μg/ml) (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar). CGAAS-5 cells and their cell lysates were prepared as described previously (49Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses were also performed as described previously (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were captured by Gel Print 2000i/VGA and analyzed with Basic Quantifier software (version 1.0) (BioImage) as described previously (50Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Google Scholar). In a previous study using Syt IV-specific antibody, we showed that endogenous Syt IV protein is mainly present in brefeldin A-sensitive perinuclear regions (probably the Golgi) of undifferentiated PC12 cells (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 51Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Google Scholar). However, when relatively high concentrations of the anti-Syt IV-C2A antibodies (>1.5 μg/ml) were used for immunocytochemical analysis, we also detected weak dot-like Syt IV signals at the cell periphery (Fig. 1 in green), and in some cells, the Syt IV signals were accumulated at the tips of the cellular processes (Fig. 1 A, arrowhead). To investigate whether Syt IV signals at the cell periphery correspond to conventional secretory vesicles (dense-core vesicles and/or synaptic-like microvesicles), we compared the Syt IV signals with six different secretory vesicle markers (21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar, 24Fukuda M. Ogata Y. Saegusa C. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 173-180Google Scholar, 27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 52Fukuda M. Kanno E. Saegusa C. Ogata Y. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39673-39678Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 inred; Rab27A (B and C), Rab3A (E and F), Syt I (H and I), Syt IX (K and L), synaptophysin (N andO), and VAMP-2 (data not shown)). To our surprise, none of the secretory vesicle markers tested colocalized with Syt IV protein even in the cellular processes (Fig. 1 C, inset), indicating that Syt IV protein is unlikely to be present on conventional secretory vesicles in undifferentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 1 C, F, I, L, andO) (53Wang C.T. Grishanin R. Earles C.A. Chang P.Y. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2001; 294: 1111-1115Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we found that the Syt IV expression levels in the CGAAS-5 cell lines that almost completely lack dense-core vesicles (<10% of the number in wild-type PC12 cells) as a result of antisense knock down of chromogranin A (49Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Google Scholar) were almost unchanged (>80% control cell level). By contrast, the expression of Syts I and IX, two major Syt isoforms abundantly expressed on dense-core vesicles (21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar, 22Zhang X. Kim-Miller M.J. Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 599-611Google Scholar), was dramatically reduced to ∼20–30% of their expression levels in the control cells (data not shown). After exposing the PC12 cells to NGF, we observed that Syt IV protein was also localized in the distal parts of neurites where dense-core vesicles are known to be accumulated (Fig. 2 in green), although the majority of the Syt IV signals remained in the perinuclear region. We again compared Syt IV signals with the six secretory vesicle markers, especially focusing on the distal portions of neurites (Fig. 2,insets). It should be noted that only a small population of Syt IV signals colocalized with dense-core vesicle markers (yellow dots in Fig. 2, panels C,F, I, and L) and none with synaptic-like microvesicle markers (Fig. 2 O,synaptophysin, inset), although the majority of the Syt IV signals (green) in the neurites still did not coincide well with the dense-core vesicle markers (red) (Fig. 2, panels C, F, I, andL, insets). These observations were in great contrast to Syt I and Syt IX, two major Syt isoforms in PC12 cells that colocalize well in the neurites (21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar). Because NGF did not increase the protein expression levels of Syt IV (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar), the Syt IV protein in the distal parts of neurites may have been transported from the cell body (i.e. newly forming vesicles from the TGN (trans-Golgi network)) or may have been redistributed locally (i.e. sorting of immature vesicles to dense-core vesicles at the cell periphery) but were unlikely to have been synthesized locally de novo. Therefore, we hypothesized that some populations of Syt IV protein are sorted to dense-core vesicles in response to NGF stimulation, and we tested this hypothesis by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 3) because it is impossible to judge the localization of Syt IV protein on dense-core vesicles by immunocytochemistry alone.Figure 3Localization of synaptotagmin IV protein by immunoelectron microscopy in PC12 cells cultured with and without NGF. Panels show representative views of the perinuclear region containing the Golgi stained with affinity-purified anti-Syt IV-C2A antibody followed by silver enhancement. Note that Syt IV signals (i.e. gold particles) were abundant at the Golgi membranes of both the undifferentiated PC12 cells (A) and NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (B). In the absence of NGF, hardly any Syt IV signals were detected on the mature dense-core vesicles near the plasma membrane (arrowheads, upper inset in A), but some Syt IV signals were associated with immature vesicles (arrowheads, lower insetin A). By contrast, in the presence of NGF, Syt IV signals are often found on the mature dense-core vesicles (arrowheads, inset in B) in the neurites. Scale bars in B and inset inA are 1 μm and 500 nm, respectively. N, nucleus; G, Golgi.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoelectron microscopic analysis was then performed with highly specific anti-Syt IV antibody to reveal the exact localization of Syt IV protein in PC12 cells (27Ibata K. Fukuda M. Hamada T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Google Scholar, 37Ibata K. Hashikawa T. Tsuboi T. Terakawa S. Liang F. Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 401-406Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, Syt IV protein was abundantly localized on the Golgi membrane in undifferentiated PC12 cells, the same as in neocortical neurons of the developing mouse brain (37Ibata K. Hashikawa T. Tsuboi T. Terakawa S. Liang F. Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 401-406Google Scholar). The Syt IV signals were prominent in the cisterns of the trans-Golgi, TGN, and the vacuoles presumably formed from TGN, but some signals were also observed in the cis-Golgi. Consistent with the immunocytochemical findings described above, there were virtually no Syt IV signals on the mature dense-core vesicles around the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 A, upper inset,arrowheads), but in some cases, the Syt IV signals were observed on the lighter vesicles presumably corresponding to immature vesicles (Fig. 3 A, lower inset,arrowheads) (42Eaton B.A. Haugwitz M. Lau D. Moore H.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7334-7344Google Scholar). The majority of the Syt IV signals in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells was still observed around the Golgi membranes (Fig. 3 B), but some Syt IV signals were clearly localized on the dense-core vesicles in addition to the immature vesicles, especially in the distal parts of neurites and around the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 B, arrowheads,inset). Interestingly, in many specimens, the Syt IV-containing dense-core vesicles were much lighter than the non-Syt IV-containing dense-core vesicles, suggesting that Syt IV-containing dense-core vesicles may form immediately after NGF stimulation. Therefore, we concluded that at least some populations of Syt IV protein are indeed sorted to dense-core vesicles in PC12 cells after NGF stimulation. Finally, we attempted to determine whether Syt IV-containing dense-core vesicles in the presence of NGF are fully mature and thus capable of exocytosis in response to Ca2+ stimulation because PC12 cells contain various types of secretory vesicles (54Kasai H. Kishimoto T. Liu T.T. Miyashita Y. Podini P. Grohovaz F. Meldolesi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 945-949Google Scholar). To visualize the dynamics of endogenous Syt IV molecules during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, an N-terminal antibody-uptake experiment was performed as described previously (21Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Google Scholar,23Saegusa C. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24499-24505Google Scholar). Antibodies against the luminal domain of Syt IV (or IX) were added to the extracellular medium, and PC12 cells were stimulated either with a low or high concentration of KCl. If the Syt IV-containing vesicle undergoes exocytosis in response to Ca2+ stimulation, the N terminus of Syt IV would be accessible on the outer surface of the cell membrane and therefore should be recognized by anti-Syt IV-N antibody in the culture medium. The Syt IV-antibody complex would then be incorporated into the cell by endocytosis. The uptake of the anti-Syt IX-N antibody into the cell body and neurites occurred only at depolarizing KCl concentrations regardless of NGF exposure as described previously (Fig. 4, I–L). The high KCl-dependent uptake of the antibody should be Ca"

Electron transfer is accomplished by FMN and a series of iron-sulfur clusters. Its coupling with proton translocation is not yet understood. Here, we report that the redox reaction of the FeS cluster N2 located on subunit NuoB of the Escherichia coli complex I induces a protonation/deprotonation of tyrosine side chains. Electrochemically induced FT-IR difference spectra revealed characteristic tyrosine signals at 1,515 and 1,498 cm−1 for the protonated and deprotonated form, respectively. Mutants of three conserved tyrosines on NuoB were generated by complementing a chromosomal in-frame deletion strain with nuoB on a plasmid. Though the single mutations did not alter the electron transport activity of complex I, the EPR signal of cluster N2 was slightly shifted. The tyrosine signals detected by FT-IR spectroscopy were roughly halved in the mutants Y114C and Y139C while only minor changes were detected in the Y154H mutant. The enzymatic activity of the Y114C/Y139F double mutant was 80% reduced, and FT-IR difference spectra of the double mutant revealed a complete loss the modes characteristic for protonation reactions of tyrosines. Therefore, we propose that tyrosines 114 and 139 on NuoB were protonated upon reduction of cluster N2 and were thus involved in the proton-transfer reaction coupled with its redox reaction.

By this means, complex I establishes a proton motive force required for energy consuming processes (1Weiss H. Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Preis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 563-576Google Scholar, 2Walker J.E. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Google Scholar, 3Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Google Scholar). Homologues of the complex are present in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes (4Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Google Scholar, 5Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Google Scholar). Complex I from bacteria generally consists of 14 different subunits (4Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H.

Seven of these are peripheral proteins including those subunits that bear all known redox groups of complex I, namely one FMN and up to nine iron-sulfur (FeS)1 clusters. The remaining 7 subunits are hydrophobic proteins predicted to fold into 54 α-helices across the membrane (1Weiss H. Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Preis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 563-576Google Scholar, 2Walker J.E. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Google Scholar). They are most likely involved in ubiquinone reduction and proton translocation. The mitochondrial complex I of eukaryotes contains at least 29 extra proteins in addition to the homologues of the 14 prokaryotic complex I subunits (1Weiss H. Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Preis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 563-576Google Scholar, 2Walker J.E. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Google Scholar). The genes of the Escherichia coli complex I are namednuoA to nuoN (7Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Google Scholar). nuoC andD are fused in E. coli giving rise to 13 different subunits assembling the complex (8Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Google Scholar). The preparation of theE. coli complex I contains one non-covalently bound FMN, two binuclear (N1a and N1b), and five tetranuclear (N2, N3, N4, N6a, and N6b) FeS clusters (Refs. 9Leif H. Sled V.D.

Friedrich, unpublished data. 2M. Uhlmann and T. Friedrich, unpublished data. The tetranuclear cluster N5 present in complex I from other species has not yet been detected in this preparation. However, it should be present because of the preservation of the corresponding binding motif (7Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Google Scholar, 12Yano T. Magnitsky S. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 299-305Google Scholar, 13Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Google Scholar). The isolated complex can be split into a so-called NADH dehydrogenase fragment, a connecting fragment, and a membrane fragment (8Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Google Scholar, 9Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar). The soluble NADH dehydrogenase fragment harbors the FMN and the EPR-detectable FeS clusters N1a, N1b, N3, and N4 (Refs. 9Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar, 14Braun M. Bungert S. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1861-1867Google Scholar, and15Bungert S. Krafft B. Schlesinger R. Friedrich T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 207-211Google Scholar).2 The amphipathic connecting fragment contains the FeS clusters N2, N6a, and N6b (9Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar, 11Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Brors B. Kintscher L. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6124-6131Google Scholar), while a chromophore with a yet unknown chemical structure, has been detected in the membrane fragment (16Schulte U. Haupt V. Abelmann A. Fecke W. Brors B. Rasmussen T. Friedrich T. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 569-580Google Scholar, 17Friedrich T. Abelmann A. Brors B. Guénebaut V. Kintscher L. Leonard K. Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Schlitt A. Schulte U. Weiss H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 215-219Google Scholar, 18Friedrich T. Brors B. Hellwig P. Kintscher L. Scheide D. Schulte U. Rasmussen T. Mäntele W. Weiss H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 305-310Google Scholar). The so-called isopotential FeS clusters N1a, N1b, N3, N4, N6a, and N6b show similar midpoint potentials ranging from −0.28 to −0.24 mV. Together with the FMN (Em,7 = −0.26 mV) they form the electron input part of complex I involved in NADH oxidation (4Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Google Scholar). Electrons are transferred further to the high potential cluster N2 (Em,7 = −0.22 mV). Cluster N2 is located on NuoB (11Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Brors B. Kintscher L. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6124-6131Google Scholar, 19Duarte M. Populo H. Videira A. Friedrich T. Schulte U. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 833-839Google Scholar). This subunit contains solely three conserved cysteines as possible ligands (7Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Google Scholar). The fourth ligand of cluster N2, which may even reside on another subunit, remains to be established. The midpoint potential of FeS cluster N2 is, in contrast to most other clusters, pH-dependent (20Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 111-117Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that N2 is the electron donor to quinone and directly involved in proton translocation (13Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Google Scholar, 20Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 111-117Google Scholar). If cluster N2 is involved in proton pumping, its redox reaction should be coupled to a protonation/deprotonation of the cluster itself and/or of surrounding amino acids. Recently, we were able to show that the reduction of N2 is coupled with a deprotonation of an Asp or Glu side chain by means of electrochemically induced FT-IR difference spectra (18Friedrich T. Brors B. Hellwig P. Kintscher L. Scheide D. Schulte U. Rasmussen T. Mäntele W. Weiss H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 305-310Google Scholar, 21Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the reduction of cluster N2 is associated with the protonation of two tyrosine side chains. Mutants of the three conserved tyrosines on NuoB were generated by complementation of a chromosomal nuoB deletion strain with expression ofnuoB from a plasmid. Complementation of the nuoBdeletion strain with either wild-type or mutated nuoBresulted in a fully assembled, active, and stable complex I. EPR spectroscopy of complex I isolated from the mutants revealed a shift in the signal of cluster N2. While the single mutants exhibited wild type NADH oxidase activity, the Y114C/Y139F double mutant showed an 80% reduced activity. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed that tyrosines 114 and 139 on NuoB are both involved in the protonation reaction coupled with the reduction of N2. E. coli strains DH5α (22Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-565Google Scholar), AN387 (23Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Google Scholar), and ANN023 3V. Spehr, T. Bischof, and T. Friedrich, unpublished results. and the plasmids pSTBlue-1 (Novagen) and pBAD33 (24Guzman L. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Scopus (3886) Google Scholar) were used. Strain ANN023 is a derivative of strain AN387 and contains a chromosomal in-frame deletion of nuoB. When required for maintenance of plasmids, chloramphenicol was added to 20 mg/liter and ampicillin to 100 mg/liter. All enzymes used for recombinant DNA techniques were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt), Serva (Heidelberg), or Sigma. E. coli genomic DNA was prepared with the Genomic DNA purification kit (MBI). The entire nuoB gene was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA as template and cloned into pSTBlue-1. Mutations in nuoB were created using either the QuickChange or ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (both from Stratagene) and are given in TableI. Sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pSTBlue-1 containing nuoB was digested with KpnI/SacI, and the resulting 860-bp fragment was cloned into the expression vector pBAD33. The resulting plasmids were named pBAD-B type withtype defining either the wild type gene or the corresponding mutation. The plasmids carrying the mutation were used for transformation of the deletion strain ANN023. Transformants were grown in a 10-liter culture of LB medium at 37 °C. Arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) at an OD600 of approximate 0.5. Three hours after induction, 30–40 g of cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g. Cells were washed with 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0 and stored at −80 °C.Table IOligonucleotides used for genomic amplification and site-directed mutagenesisOligonucleotideSequencenuoB_for5′-AATCTAGAGCTAATCGTCAACGCTAACC-3′nuoB_rev5′-AATCTAGAGCTAATCGTCAACGCTAACC-3′nuoB Y114C_for5′-CCGGTTATTCAGCGTCTGTG TGATCAGATGCTGG-3′nuoB Y139C_for5′-GGTGGTATGTACGATATC TGTTCCGTTGTGCAGGCG-3′nuoB Y139_for5′-GGTGGTATGTACGATATC TTTTCCGTTGTGCAGG-3′nuoB Y154H_for5′-ACATCCCGGGCTGCCGCGC-3′nuoB Y154H_rev5′-GCACATCAACCGGGATGAATTTATCGACGC-3′Underlined positions indicate new restriction sites, bold positions are responsible for the indicated mutation.

In principle, complex I was isolated by means of a procedure developed for a strain overproducing complex I (10Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Google Scholar). However, the membranes of the mutant strains were not washed with NaBr to remove ATP synthase as described due to the lower amount of complex I. Therefore, the preparations contained detectable amounts of ATP synthase, which, however, did not interfere with our assays. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. 60 g of cells were resuspended in 150 ml of 50 mmMES/NaOH, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.0, with 10 μg/ml DNase I and disrupted by a single pass through a French Pressure cell (SLM Aminco) at 110 MPa. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 36,000 × g, and cytoplasmic membranes were obtained by centrifugation for 1 h at 250,000 × g. Membrane proteins were extracted by adding dodecyl maltoside to a final concentration of 3%. The solution was gently homogenized and centrifuged for 1 h at 250,000 ×g. The supernatant was applied to a 60-ml Source 15Q (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 50 mmMES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0. The column was eluted with a 700-ml linear gradient of 50–350 mm NaCl in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0 at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions containing NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were combined, concentrated by precipitation with 9% (w/v; final concentration) polyethylene glycol 4,000 and dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0. The protein was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a 180-ml Ultrogel AcA 34 (Serva) column in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mmNaCl, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 7 ml/h. Peak fractions were pooled and applied to a 10- ml Source 15Q (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated as described above and eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 50–350 mm NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions with NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Complex I from wild type was prepared with the same procedure. The NADH dehydrogenase fragment of the complex was isolated as described (15Bungert S. Krafft B. Schlesinger R. Friedrich T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 207-211Google Scholar). For electrochemistry, the preparations were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon 100, Amicon) to ∼0.2 mm. The ultrathin layer spectroelectrochemical cell for UV/Vis and IR was used as previously described (25Hellwig P. Behr J. Ostermeier C. Richter O.-M.H. Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7390-7399Google Scholar). Sufficient transmission in the 1,800 cm−1 to 1,000 cm−1 range, even in the region of strong water absorbance around 1,645 cm−1, was achieved with the cell pathlength set to 6–8 μm. To avoid protein denaturation, the gold grid-working electrode was chemically modified by a 2 mm cysteamine solution as reported (25Hellwig P. Behr J. Ostermeier C. Richter O.-M.H. Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7390-7399Google Scholar). In order to accelerate the redox reaction, the following mediators were used at a final concentration of 45 μm each: ferrocenyltrimethylammoniumiodide (+645 mV), 1,1′-dicarboxylferrocene (+644 mV), diethyl-3-methylparaphenylenediamine (+367 mV), ferricyanide (+424 mV), dimethylparaphenylenediamine (+371 mV), 1,1′-dimethylferrocene (+341 mV), tetramethylparaphenylenediamine (+270 mV), tetrachlorobenzoquinone (+280 mV), 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (+217 mV), ruthenium hexamine chloride (200 mV), 1,2-naphthoquinone (−145 mV), trimethylhydroquinone (100 mV), menadione (−12 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphtoquinone (−125 mV), anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (−225 mV), neutral red (−307 mV), benzyl viologen (−360 mV), and methyl viologen (−446 mV). At the given concentrations and with the pathlength below 10 μm, no spectral contributions from the mediators in the visible and IR range used were detected in control experiments with samples lacking the protein. Approximately 6–7 μl of the protein solution were sufficient to fill the spectroelectrochemical cell. FT-IR difference spectra as a function of the applied potential were obtained simultaneously from the same sample with a setup combining an IR beam from the interferometer (modified IFS 25, Bruker, Germany) for the 4,000 cm−1 to 1,000 cm−1 range and a dispersive spectrometer for the 400–900-nm range as reported previously (26Mäntele W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 197-202Google Scholar, 27Moss D.A. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 565-572Google Scholar). First, the protein was equilibrated with an initial potential at the electrode and single beam spectra in the visible and IR range were recorded. Then a potential step toward the final potential was applied and single beam spectra of this state were again recorded after equilibration. Difference spectra were calculated from the two single beam spectra with the initial single beam spectrum taken as reference. No smoothing or deconvolution procedures were applied. The equilibration process for each applied potential was followed by monitoring the electrode current and by successively recording spectra in the visible range until no further changes were observed. The equilibration generally took less than 8 min for the full potential step from −0.5 V to 0.0 V. Typically, 128 interferograms at 4 cm−1 resolution were coadded for each single beam IR spectrum and Fourier-transformed using triangular apodization. Up to 5 × 20 difference spectra have been averaged. The presence of atmospheric water vapor was avoided as described (21Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Google Scholar). Low temperature EPR measurements were conducted with a Bruker EMX 1/6 spectrometer. The sample temperature was controlled with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 helium flow cryostat. Complex I at 10 mg/ml was reduced with a 1,000-fold molar excess of NADH in the presence of redox mediators as described (9Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar). The EPR tube was frozen in 5:1 isopentane/methylcyclohexane (v/v) at 150 K. The magnetic field was calibrated using a strong pitch standard. The NADH:decylubiquinone reductase activity of complex I was measured with a Perkin Elmer 156 dual-wavelength spectrophotometer using the wavelength 340 and 400 nm and ε of 6.3 mm−1 cm−1. The assay contained 5 mm MES/NaOH, 0.1 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, and 50 μm NADH and 25 μm decylubiquinone. The reaction was started by addition of 10 μg of complex I (28Böttcher B. Scheide D. Hesterberg M. Nagel-Steger L. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17970-17977Google Scholar). The NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity, and the NADH oxidase activity were measured as described (29Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Ise W. Nehls U. Schmitz B. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 173-180Google Scholar, 30Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R. Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Höfle G. Reichenbach H. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 691-698Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with the biuret method using bovine serum albumin as standard. Sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of 0.2% dodecyl maltoside was performed as described (9Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE protein bands were either stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher und Schüll) according to Ref. 31Towbin H.

Electrochemically-induced FT-IR difference spectra of complex I contain contributions from redox-dependent changes in the protein structure and protonation states of cofactors and individual amino acids. In order to detect changes associated with the redox reaction of FeS cluster N2 we recorded FT-IR spectra of complex I at the potential step from −0.5 to 0.0 V (Fig. 1 A, a). The difference spectrum of complex I obtained for this potential step was compared with difference spectra of the NADH dehydrogenase fragment of complex I for the same potential step (Fig. 1 A,b). The double difference spectrum (Fig. 1 A, c) showed spectral contributions from rearrangement of the polypeptide backbone and contributions of individual amino acids such as the protonation/deprotonation of aspartic or glutamic side chain(s) as reported (21Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Google Scholar). In addition, the spectrum showed contributions at 1,515 and 1,500 cm−1, which were tentatively attributed to tyrosine side chains. From model spectra of the protonated tyrosine (Fig. 1 B, a) the prominent signal at 1,518 cm−1 was attributed to the ν19(CC) ring mode. At 1,249 cm−1 a signal composed of the ν7′a(CO) vibration and the δ(COH) vibration was expected, the position being sensitive to the hydrogen-bonding environment. For deprotonated tyrosine in solution (Fig. 1 B,b) the ν8a/8b(CC) ring mode was identified at 1,560 cm−1 and the ν19(CC) ring mode at 1,499 cm−1, thus reflecting the sensitivity of the ring modes to the protonation state of the phenol group. The ν7′a(CO) mode was present at 1,269 cm−1(32Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. Castresana J. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Google Scholar, 33Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N.

From direct comparison of the signals in the double difference spectrum and in the model compound spectra, a protonation of one or more tyrosine side chains was suggested to be coupled with the reduction of the enzyme. We set out to confirm this tentative assignment by site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved tyrosines on NuoB. Approximately 70% ofnuoB was deleted from the chromosome of wild type strain AN387 without interrupting the reading frame.3 The resulting strain ANN023 was complemented with the wild typenuoB on the plasmid pBAD33, under control of the inducible pBAD promotor. This strain was called ANN023/pBAD33-BWT. The presence of NuoB in the strains AN387, ANN023, and ANN023/pBAD33-BWT was determined by reaction of a specific antibody with blotted membrane proteins after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). NuoB was detected in the membranes of the strains AN387 and ANN023/pBAD33-BWT while it was missing in the membranes of strain ANN023. We tested whether NuoB expressed from the plasmid was able to assemble an intact complex I with the residual complex I subunits encoded on the chromosome by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3). Dodecyl maltoside extracts of cytoplasmic membranes from strains ANN023 and ANN023/pBAD33-BWT were applied on a 12-ml sucrose gradient. Complex I from E. coli typically sediments two thirds of the way through the gradient as detected by its NADH/ferricyanide activity (9Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar, 10Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Google Scholar). No NADH/ferricyanide activity was detectable in the corresponding fractions of strain ANN023 indicating that complex I was not assembled in the absence of NuoB (Fig. 3). Instead, fractions in the first third of the gradient exhibited NADH/ferricyanide activity, which stemmed from the alternative, non-proton pumping NADH dehydrogenase. The expression of this alternative NADH dehydrogenase is increased in the absence of complex I. The sedimentation profile of the extract obtained from strain ANN023/pBAD33-B WT showed NADH/ferricyanide activity in the fractions corresponding to the wild type enzyme (Fig. 3). Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of NuoB in the corresponding fractions (data not shown). Again, the alternative NADH dehydrogenase was detected in the first third of the gradient but in smaller amounts. These data showed that the assembly of complex I was restored by complementation of nuoB on a plasmid. The amount of complex I in the cytoplasmic membranes of these strains was estimated from the (d-) NADH/ferricyanide activity as well as from the (d-) NADH oxidase activity (Table 2). The artificial substrate d-NADH was used to discriminate the two membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenases ofE. coli (30Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R.

While NADH can be used by both NADH dehydrogenases, d-NADH preferently reacts with complex I. The d-NADH/ferricyanide activity as well as the d-NADH oxidase activity was nearly abolished in strain ANN023 lacking an assembled complex I. These activities were restored to wild type level in strain ANN023/pBAD33-B WT (Table 2). The NADH/ferricyanide and NADH oxidase activity of strain ANN023 was decreased to about one-third of the wild type activity due to that of the alternative NADH dehydrogenase. Two-thirds of the NADH oxidase activity was inhibited by 10 μm piericidin A in AN387 and ANN023/pBAD33-BWT. The NADH oxidase activity of strain ANN023 was virtually not inhibited by piericidin A, demonstrating the lack of complex I in this strain.Table IIEnzyme activities of the membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenases of E. coli wild type and various NuoB mutantsStrainNADH/ferricyanide reductase activityd-NADH/ferricyanide reductase activityNADH oxidase activityd-NADH oxidase activityInhibition of the NADH oxidase activity by piericidin Aμmol min −1 mg −1%AN387 (wild type)1.00.80.150.0669ANN023 (ΔnuoB)0.60.10.050<10ANN023/pBAD-BWT0.90.80.080.0567ANN023/pBAD-BY114C0.90.80.070.0566ANN023/pBAD-BY139C0.80.80.080.0465ANN023/pBAD-BY154H0.90.70.080.0567ANN023/pBAD-BY114C/Y139F0.50.40.050.01<10 Open table in a new tab Among all subunits present in complex I from different sources, NuoB shows the highest degree of sequence conservation (4Friedrich T.

Alignment of the homologues of NuoB showed the presence of three tyrosine residues being conserved within all three domains of life (Fig. 4). Involvement of the conserved tyrosines in the protonation/deprotonation induced by the redox reaction of cluster N2 was advanced by constructing site-directed mutants. The mutants Y114C, Y139C, Y154H, and Y114C/Y139F of NuoB were expressed using the system described above. To determine whether complex I was assembled in the mutant strains, the (d-) NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity and the (d-) NADH oxidase activity of cytoplasmic membranes were measured as described above. The strains carrying a single mutation exhibited activities with d-NADH as substrate comparable to the wild type strain AN387 and the complemented strain ANN023/pBAD33-B WT (Table 2) indicating that complex I in the mutants was able to transfer electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. The NADH oxidase activity in these mutant strains was inhibited by about two-thirds by 10 μm piericidin A. Thus, the amount and the activity of complex I in the membranes was not influenced by the mutations introduced. The d-NADH/ferricyanide activity of the strain carrying the Y114C/Y139F double mutation was 50% reduced compared with wild type and this strain showed 20% of the d-NADH oxidase activity. NuoB was detected in the cytoplasmic membranes from this mutants by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). These data suggested that half of the amount of complex I with a strongly reduced activity is present in this strain. For spectroscopic characterization c"

In yeast cells, the unprocessed precursor of each of these mutants is secreted, whereas >90% of the endoproteolytically released single-chain insulin moiety is retained intracellularly; a large portion of the B9D, B10D, and B12E single-chain insulins exhibit abnormally slow mobility upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE, despite normal mobility upon reducing SDS-PAGE. Although no free thiols can be detected, each of these mutants exhibits increased disulfide accessibility to dithiothreitol. After dithiothreitol treatment, a portion of the molecules can reoxidize to a form more compact than the original single-chain insulin mutants formed in vivo (indicating initial disulfide mispairing). Disulfide mispairing of a fraction of B9D, B10D, and B12E mutants also occurs in the context of single-chain insulin and even in authentic proinsulin expressed within the secretory pathway of mammalian cells.

In the latter case, upon ICFP cleavage in the distal secretory pathway by Kex2p endoprotease to liberate the alpha leader peptide, a crystallizable single-chain insulin is produced with a structure essentially isomorphous with that of authentic two-chain insulin (3Kjeldsen T.

We have shown previously that upon expression of ICFP at modest levels, the fraction of molecules remaining unprocessed is secreted rapidly, whereas the other fraction undergoing Kex2p-mediated endoproteolysis results in a single-chain insulin that primarily is not secreted (5Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, this sorting, determined by Kex2p-mediated processing, is saturable. Failure to secrete the single-chain insulin moiety cannot be explained by ICFP endoproteolysis within a “dead-end” compartment from which molecules can no longer be secreted, because simple deletion of the yeast KEX2 gene not only prevents ICFP processing but also increases the quantity of ICFP secreted. It is known that by liberating insulin from its precursor (in either mammalian cells or yeast), cleavage promotes a change in the biophysical properties of the processed product (5Zhang B.-y.

Given that some assembly-deficient B-chain point mutants are thought to exhibit folding stability comparable with that of native insulin (20Kaarsholm N.C., Ko, H.C. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4427-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we have now examined the expression of these B-chain point mutants in the secretory pathway of yeast and in transiently transfected mammalian cells. Although the B28K,B29P double mutant was expressed generally at the lowest levels, each of the B9D, B10D, and B12E mutants produced more than one isomer differing in disulfide bonding, suggesting that these mutants have varying degrees of predisposition for disulfide mispairing during initial folding in the secretory pathway. Polyclonal anti-insulin was made in guinea pigs (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Secondary antibodies and peroxidase conjugates were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); Zysorbin was fromZymed Laboratories Inc., and protein A-agarose was from Sigma. [35S]Cysteine and [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (Expre35S35S) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Methionine/cysteine-deficient mammalian cell culture medium, brefeldin A, and stock chemicals were from Sigma. Unless otherwise indicated, strains employed in this study are isogenic to PA13 (MATa,kss1, ura3–52,leu2–3,112, his3,trp1^63, ade2, GAL+), which has a complete deletion of the PEP4 gene, marked with URA3 (5Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The VPS10 gene was then disrupted by transformation with XhoI and BamHI fragment of pEM10–103 (21Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 579-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) to produce strain PA11D. pMIGLC, a TRP1-marked centromeric plasmid (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bearing the wild-type ICFP sequence is as described previously (with the clarification that the strong promoter/terminator previously reported as belonging to the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene,GPD1, in fact belongs to the promoter of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, known as TDH3, and the terminator of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, known asPGK1) (5Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In one set of experiments examining the effects of vps10, each of the insulin B-chain point mutations was prepared by PCR mutagenesis (of an ∼0.4-kbEcoRI-HindIII PCR-amplified fragment containing the relevant mutation that was used to replace the matchingEcoRI-HindIII fragment of ICFP, confirmed by DNA sequencing) in the context of the pMIGLC vector, and these were transformed into PA11D and the PA13 parental strain. In a second set of experiments, strain AHY63 was employed (the kind gift of Dr. S. Nothwehr, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) which is isogenic with W303-1A (MATa; ura3–1;leu2–3,112; his3–11,15;trp1–1, can1–100; ade2–1) but contains pho8Δ::ADE2 and carries the unmarkedpep4-ΔH3 mutation (23Nothwehr S.F., Ha, S.A. Bruinsma P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The VPS10 gene was then disrupted in this strain (as described above) to produce strain YB136. In addition, the TRP1marker of the pMIGLC series of ICFP expression vectors was replaced by the URA3 marker from a URA3-marked centromeric plasmid (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create a series of vectors called pGMU, bearing each of the insulin B-chain point mutations. These vectors, individually, were transformed into YB136 and the AHY63 parental strain. For experiments examining the nonreducing SDS-PAGE mobility of insulin bearing different B-chain point mutations, the URA3 marker of PA13 was disrupted by insertion of HIS3(pUC119-ura3::HIS3 cut with XmaI) to produce strain YB118. Then, each of the pGMU series of vectors bearing insulin B-chain point mutations was transformed into YB118. Cells were grown to exponential phase in minimal medium supplemented with required amino acids but without methionine and cysteine, using 2% glucose as the carbon source, and then sedimented at 3000 × g for 5 min and resuspended at 4A 600/ml in the same medium plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For pulse labeling, [35S]cysteine was added at 50 μCi/A 600 for 5 min (unless otherwise indicated). The cells were chased in synthetic complete (SC) medium plus 10 mm methionine and cysteine. At 45 min of chase (unless otherwise indicated), 1-ml aliquots were transferred to ice, and 10 mm sodium azide and a protease inhibitor mixture (aprotinin, 0.25 μg/ml; leupeptin, 0.1 mm; pepstatin, 10 μm; EDTA, 5 mm; E64, 10 μm; diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mm, bovine serum albumin 0.02%) were added immediately. Cells were then sedimented at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing secreted proteins was collected for further analysis. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of breaking buffer containing 6 murea, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads and then boiling for 4 min. Samples were diluted 10-fold to a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, precleared with 20 μl of zysorbin for 30 min (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), and then immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of guinea pig anti-insulin plus 20 μl of zysorbin. Immunoprecipitates were digested with PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of reducing conditions as described in the text. For the sample preparation in the experiment shown in Fig. 2, yeast cells were lysed in the absence of detergent, Triton X-100 was added to 0.9%, and the samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin as described above. The immunoprecipitates were then exposed sequentially to 18 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C, to iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 36 mm (37 °C, 5 min), and finally to SDS gel sample buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE. We modified the Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE system (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) as follows. In addition to TEMED and ammonium persulfate as described, the resolving gel contained 11.2% acrylamide, 0.35% bisacrylamide, 10% Prosieve-50 (BioWhittaker), and a final concentration of 6.0 m urea in 0.1% SDS and 1.0m Tris, pH 8.45. Before this was allowed to polymerize, it was overlaid with a small quantity (sufficient for adding 0.2 cm of overlay) of “spacer gel” containing, in addition to TEMED and persulfate, 9.3% acrylamide and 0.6% bisacrylamide without Prosieve or urea in 0.1% SDS and 1.0 m Tris, pH 8.45. 30 min after polymerization of the resolving and spacer gel, a stacking gel was poured containing, in addition to TEMED and persulfate, 3.7% acrylamide and 0.24% bisacrylamide in 0.075% SDS and 0.75m Tris, pH 8.45. None of the gel solutions were degassed before use. The sample buffer we used resulted in a final concentration of 2% SDS, 12% glycerol, and 0.0025% Serva blue in 50 mmTris, pH 6.8. Typically, insulin samples were boiled for 5 min before gel loading, although we found that omitting the boiling step had essentially no effect on the outcome of these experiments. The tank buffers were the same as those described previously: a running buffer of 0.1% SDS in 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m Tricine, pH 8.25, and an anode buffer of 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.9 (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). This gel system was essential to the detection of mobility differences between the insulin species described. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. A cDNA encoding wild-type human proinsulin was cloned into the pcDNA3 (CMV promoter-driven) expression vector (Invitrogen). Each of the insulin B-chain point mutations was prepared by PCR mutagenesis within an ∼0.4-kb PCR-amplified fragment within the pGEM-T vector and then subcloned to replace the appropriate wild-type proinsulin sequence in pcDNA3 with successful completion of the mutagenesis confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pRSV-InsDC plasmid (encoding a preproinsulin in which the C-peptide and endoproteolytic cleavage sites are completely lacking), obtained from Dr. H. P. Moore (University of California, Berkeley), was subcloned to pcDNA3 and used as the template for further PCR mutagenesis to encode an artificial 7-amino acid C-peptide sequence comprising MGGGGGM (Met-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Met). The resulting construct is referred to in this manuscript as SCI (single-chain insulin). The SCI construct was then submitted to additional rounds of PCR mutagenesis to produce the same specific B-chain point mutations as those produced in the yeast ICFP and in proinsulin. Plasmid DNA was transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were metabolically radiolabeled with a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium and chased for 1 h in complete medium. Where indicated, brefeldin A was included during labeling and chase at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. At the end of the chase, the medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Cell lysates and chase media were treated with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), precleared with zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with guinea pig anti-insulin as described above. Zysorbin-bound immunocomplexes were sedimented at 12,000 × g for 1 min, and pellets were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and once in high salt buffer (0.5m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) before analysis by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of reducing conditions as described above. AMS was purchased from Molecular Probes (catalog No. A-485). Immunoprecipitates with anti-insulin, derived either from yeast or mammalian cells, were divided in 50 μl of either 80 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm AMS or an identical buffer without AMS. The samples were then resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. In some cases, identical aliquots of radiolabeled yeast or mammalian cell lysate were incubated with AMS prior to lysis and insulin immunoprecipitation, but the results were identical to those obtained when the AMS reaction was performed after immunoprecipitation. We previously found that in yeast, after Kex2p-mediated endoproteolytic removal of the alpha leader peptide from ICFP (bearing the wild-type B-chain residues 1–29 and A-chain residues 1–21 made contiguous by an AAK tripeptide linker sequence), a single-chain insulin was produced that was not efficiently secreted and instead accumulated intracellularly in a manner dependent upon PEP4, encoding the major yeast vacuolar proteinase (5Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this intracellular targeting was entirely dependent upon the catalytic activity encoded by KEX2, and the sorting function provided by this gene could be replaced in trans by expression of a truncated, membraneless, secretory Kex2p. In contrast, intracellular insulin targeting was not perturbed by deletion of the VPS10 gene encoding a vacuolar sorting receptor. The present study was initiated to examine the effect of B-chain point mutations on the expression and trafficking of insulin. Because substitution of proximal B-chain residues can provoke increased conformational changes of the insulin moiety including increased B-chain flexibility (25Yao Z.P. Zeng Z.H., Li, H.M. Zhang Y.

Dodson G.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the B-subdomain may provide a template to guide folding of the A-chain (27Hua Q.X. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W., Hu, S.Q. Chu Y.C. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12299-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Guo Z.Y. Shen L. Feng Y.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10585-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that such B-chain point mutants might be recognized as misfolded by Vps10p (29Hong E. Davidson A.R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Holkeri H. Makarow M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Jorgensen M.U. Emr S.D. Winther J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We therefore employed a pulse-chase protocol to examine the behavior of ICFP constructs bearing B9D, B10D, B12E, or B28K,B29P point mutations, driven by the strong TDH3promoter, in strains that were (or were not) deleted forVPS10. At this level of substrate expression the processing activity of Kex2p is limiting (5Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom left), for the wild-type insulin sequence the unprocessed ICFP was well secreted, and the processed form was stored (in the vacuole) of pep4 null cells. In agreement with our previous study, introduction of the B5T mutation greatly augmented ICFP expression, but the small amount of cleaved B5T-insulin was not retained efficiently intracellularly (Fig. 1). Each of the other point mutants was expressed (although the B28K,B29P samples had to be overloaded in order to achieve a comparable radioactive protein signal), and in each case, the fusion protein was secreted, whereas the processed insulin mutant was retained efficiently (Fig. 1). For the vps10 mutant strains, there was at most a modest effect observed for B10D, B12E, and B28K,B29P mutants, as the final ratio of unprocessed ICFP in the medium to processed insulin in the cells was not greatly affected. As shown in the enlarged image of the gel analyzing the B10D mutant (Fig. 1, right), only a small decrease in intracellular insulin, coupled with a small increase in secreted ICFP, was detectable. Upon endoproteolytic processing in yeast, the resulting single-chain insulin containing the wild-type sequence has a structure that tends to resist disulfide reduction with DTT under nondenaturing conditions (5Zhang B.-y. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To further explore the stability of single-chain insulins bearing B-chain point mutations, immunoprecipitates from cells expressing various mutant constructs were exposed to 20 mm DTT under nondenaturing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). After such treatment, single-chain insulin without additional B-chain point mutations was largely recovered as a band with an identical mobility to that of a parallel sample not treated with DTT (Fig. 2, open arrow). However, each of the B-chain point mutants exhibited enhanced sensitivity to DTT as demonstrated by diminished recovery of the single-chain insulin band upon SDS-PAGE. These data suggest differences in the conformational stability of the single-chain insulins bearing wild-type and mutant sequences. Although many structural analyses of insulin B-chain point mutants have begun with chemically or bacterially synthesized peptides or otherwise purified material that has been folded or refolded in vitro or purified for structural homogeneity by selection of a specific HPLC peak (32Yuan Y. Wang Z.H. Tang J.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 139-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), relatively few studies have examined the folding of such mutants as they are produced in vivo within the eukaryotic secretory pathway. It is known that substitution of proximal B-chain residues, such as the B9S substitution with a Glu residue, can provoke conformational changes of the B-chain (25Yao Z.P. Zeng Z.H., Li, H.M. Zhang Y. Feng Y.M. Wang D.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1524-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Dodson E.J. Brange J. Dodson G.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that may influence formation of one or more interchain disulfide bonds (33Qiao Z.S. Guo Z.Y. Feng Y.M. Biochem. 2001; 40: 2662-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). (Disulfide mispairing is also known to occur during production of recombinant IGF-1; see “Discussion”.) To study this question, we examined the mobility of intracellular single-chain insulins bearing various B-chain point mutations upon reducing versus nonreducing SDS-PAGE. In short, upon reducing SDS-PAGE, all single-chain insulin constructs exhibited an identical mobility (Fig. 3 A, left). However, upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE, single-chain insulins bearing B9D, B10D, or B12E point mutations consistently exhibited a slower SDS-PAGE mobility (arrows in Fig. 3 A, right). The B28K,B29P double mutant was always more poorly expressed than the other insulin constructs; however, its mobility by nonreducing SDS-PAGE appeared normal (Fig. 3 A). The isoelectric points of the constructs were unlikely to explain the anomalous mobility of the B-chain point mutants, as these parameters did not strictly correlate (Fig. 3 A, and data not shown). To determine whether any of the mutant forms contained unpaired cysteine residues bearing free thiols, each construct was incubated (or not) in the presence of AMS (34Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This compound adds >500 daltons to the molecular mass of the polypeptide upon thiol reaction with an AMS residue, and such a molecular mass increase should be readily detected as loss of the 6-kDa single-chain insulin band (with shift to a higher molecular weight). However, as shown in Fig. 3 B, none of the B-chain point mutants showed detectable reactivity with AMS (unless disulfide bonds were first broken by treatment with dithiothreitol; not shown). Thus, no positive evidence for unpaired cysteine residues could be found for any of the B-chain point mutants studied. Pulse-labeled yeast cells expressing wild-type control ICFP or ICFP bearing B9D, B10D, B12E, or B28K,B29P mutations were chased for 45 min in complete medium, and both the lysed cells and chase media were analyzed by insulin immunoprecipitation and nonreducing SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4(upper panels), in which equal proportions of cell lysate and medium were analyzed, a nearly undetectable quantity of processed insulin was released to the medium (amounting to no more than a few percent) for any of the constructs examined. However, when markedly unequal exposures of these gels were obtained, significantly underexposing the cell lysate insulin while overexposing that recovered in the medium (Fig 4, lower panels), two interesting features became apparent. First, although the bulk of intracellular B9D, B10D, and B12E mutants exhibited abnormal mobility on nonreducing gels, a much smaller quantity of these mutant insulins exhibited a mobility that was indistinguishable from that of the single-chain insulin bearing the wild-type control sequence (Fig. 4,left). Second, for these mutants, the very little processed insulin that was secreted was enriched in a species for which mobility was indistinguishable from that of the single-chain insulin bearing the wild-type control sequence (Fig. 4, right). Together, the data in Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate that for single-chain insulin bearing certain B-chain point mutations, distinct isoforms are detectable upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE, which can no longer be distinguished upon disulfide reduction. Assuming that the faster species co-migrating with single-chain insulin bearing the wild-type control sequence represents a form containing three correct (A6-A11, B7-A7, B19-A20) disulfide pairs, then a substantial portion of these B-chain point mutants is likely to represent an isomeric by-product of equal molecular mass but with one or more disulfide bonds interchanged (33Qiao Z.S. Guo Z.Y. Feng Y.M. Biochem. 2001; 40: 2662-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Sieber P. Eisler K. Kamber B. Riniker B. Rittel W. Marki F. de Gasparo M. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

Biol. 1995; 2: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the processed insulin moiety is very poorly secreted, in the case of these selected B-chain point mutants, the secretion tends to be enriched in the better folded isomer, whereas what is retained intracellularly tends to be enriched in the misfolded isomer. In the course of these studies it was observed that unlike in authentic two-chain insulin, which, after SDS denaturation, is very sensitive to in vitro disulfide reduction because of chain dissociation, it was more difficult to obtain completely reduced and alkylated single-chain insulin in vitro. An example of this for the single-chain insulin bearing the wild-type control sequence is shown in Fig. 5 (right) in which the protein becomes divided into three bands: a fast migrating species identical to the initial mobility under nonreduced conditions and two slower migrating species, the slowest of which migrates in the approximate position of fully reduced single-chain insulin (see Fig. 3 A, left panel). Although this complex pattern of bands could be attributed to incomplete initial insulin reduction with 20 mm DTT (Fig. 5), a remarkable finding was obtained when examining the behavior of processed single-chain insulin recovered from yeast cells bearing ICFP with various B-chain point mutations. Specifically, for the single-chain insulin mutants B9D, B10D, and B12E (which exhibit abnormal mobility upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE), after initial reduction with 20 mm DTT followed by treatment with 40 mm iodoacetamide, intended to alkylate all free sulfhydryls, the same three-species banding pattern was obtained in proportions similar to that observed for the wild-type control protein (Fig. 5). Indeed, the faster migrating isoform (similar to the mobility of the nonreduced wild-type control protein) was actually faster after DTT/iodoacetamide treatments than before. Although these findings do not establish whether initial reduction was complete, the data do establish that (for at least a portion of the molecules) the disulfide reduction is followed by in vitro reoxidation of single-chain insulins. For certain B-chain point mutants, this reoxidation clearly matches a better folded species than that which accumulated in living cells in the first place. Similar reoxidation results were obtained by combining reduced single-chain insulin with glutathione containing mixtures of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GS-SG) species (not shown). These results are consistent with previously published studies of single-chain insulins in vitro(33Qiao Z.S. Guo Z.Y. Feng Y.M. Biochem. 2001; 40: 2662-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The foregoing data are consistent with the possibility that B9D, B10D, and B12E point mutations may have placed conformational stress on the single-chain insulin structure (25Yao Z.P. Zeng Z.H., Li, H.M. Zhang Y. Feng Y.M. Wang D.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1524-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which might lead to disulfide mispairing in the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As the overall oxidoreductase capability of the yeast and mammalian ER may differ (39Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it seemed of interest to examine the folding of single-chain insulin constructs in the context of the mammalian secretory pathway. A cDNA encoding a single-chain insulin (SCI) bearing the wild-type preproinsulin signal peptide, B-chain and A-chain, in which the chains are linked by the 7-amino acid noncleavable sequence MGGGGGM, was constructed. When driven by a CMV promoter and introduced by transient transfection in HEK293 cells, an insulin-immunoprecipitable band was produced that migrated upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE slightly slower than an authentic iodoinsulin standard (Fig. 6 A). This slightly slower mobility was attributable solely to the presence of the linker peptide, as cyanogen bromide excision of the linker caused the SCI to co-migrate precisely with the two-chain insulin standard. 2M. Liu, J. Ramos-Castañeda, and P. Arvan, submitted for publication. The SCI was then mutagenized to include B9D, B10D, or B12E point mutations. As shown in the nonreducing gel of Fig. 6 A, immunoprecipitation of B9D or B12E point mutants produced two monomeric isoforms: a faster species that co-migrated with the wild-type control SCI sequence and a second, slower form (in addition small quantities of dimeric B9D mutant insulin were observed). As in yeast (compare with Fig. 4), less than half of the B9D or B12E mutant monomers migrated with the normal mobility. The B10D point mutant exhibited even greater perturbation of mobility upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Additionally, as has been reported for a known disulfide-mispaired isomer of insulin (38Hua Q.X. Gozani S.N. Chance R.E. Hoffmann J.A. Frank B.H. Weiss M.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), none of the bands was changed by incubation with alkylating agent (+AMS, Fig. 6 B). Once again, these data suggest disulfide mispairing of the B9D, B10D, and B12E mutant SCIs. Remarkably, despite large-scale generation of a single-chain insulin by-product with disulfide interchange, which must constitute significant misfolding, the mutant SCI constructs were secreted with an efficiency comparable with that of SCI bearing the wild-type insulin sequence. Moreover, unlike what was observed in yeast, secretion efficiency was very high and was comparable for both disulfide isomers of mutant SCI. An example of this is shown for the B9D mutant in Fig. 7 (but this was also observed for B10D and B12E mutants; not shown). Following a 1-h pulse labeling plus an additional 1.5-h chase, the majority of the wild-type SCI and both monomeric disulfide isomers of the B9D mutant were released to the medium. This release represents genuine secretion rather than nonspecific release (such as due to impaired cell viability) because it was abolished by treatment of the cells with brefeldin A, which blocks intracellular protein transport through the secretory pathway (Fig. 7). Thus, at least in HEK293 cells, misfolded disulfide isomers of single-chain insulin are apparently invisible both to ER retention/quality control machinery (40Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and to Golgi quality control machinery (13Arvan P. Zhao X. Ramos-Castañeda J. Chang A.

https://openalex.org/W1969636343,"Kar3 is a minus-end directed microtubule motor involved in meiosis and mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisae. Unlike Drosophila Ncd, the other well characterized minus-end directed motor that is a homodimer, Kar3 is a heterodimer with a single motor domain and either the associated polypeptides Cik1 or Vik1. Our mechanistic studies with Ncd showed that both motor domains were required for ATP-dependent motor domain detachment from the microtubule. We have initiated a series of experiments to compare the mechanistic requirements for Kar3 motility in direct comparison to Ncd. The results presented here show that the single motor domain of Kar3 (Met383-Lys729) exhibits characteristics similar to monomeric Ncd. The microtubule-activated steady-state ATPase cycle of Kar3 (k cat = 0.5 s−1) is limited by ADP release (0.4 s−1). Like monomeric Ncd, Kar3 does not readily detach from the microtubule with the addition of MgATP. These results show that the single motor domain of Kar3 is not sufficient for ATP-dependent microtubule dissociation, suggesting that structural elements outside of the catalytic core are required for the cyclic interactions with the microtubule for force generation."

Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition, they are characterized by a highly conserved cytoplasmic segment that contains an ankyrin binding site. The L1 family currently has four members in vertebrates (L1, NrCAM, CHL1, and neurofascin) as well as three invertebrate members, neuroglian in arthropods, Tractin in leech, and LAD-1 in nematodes (1Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Chen L. Ong B. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 841-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although also expressed in other tissues L1 family CAMs are predominantly found in the nervous system where they have been implicated in a number of different cellular processes such as neuronal cell migration, myelination, axonal growth, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance (3Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is that mutations in the human L1 gene on the X chromosome result in a complex human mental retardation syndrome referred to as MASA (4Kamiguchi H. Hlavin M.L. Yamasaki M. Lemmon V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Demyanenko G.P. Tsai A.Y. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4907-4920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the symptoms of which include hydrocephalus, spastic paraplegia, and corpus callosum agenesis (6Wong E.V. Kenwrickm S. Willemsm P. Lemmon V. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 168-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, L1 knockout mice have been generated, which show severe brain abnormalities similar to those observed in humans (7Cohen N.R. Taylor J.S.H. Scott L.B. Guillery R.W. Soriano P. Furley A.J.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 26-33Google Scholar, 8Dahme M. Bartsch U. Martini R. Anliker B. Schachner M. Mantei N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, the actual developmental mechanisms by which mutations in the L1 gene cause these brain defects are not well understood. In humans and mice the severity of the phenotypes observed is highly dependent on the genetic background suggesting the participation of modifier genes (8Dahme M. Bartsch U. Martini R. Anliker B. Schachner M. Mantei N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, the neurological phenotypes of L1 mutations observed in mammals as well as in Drosophila(9Hall S.G. Bieber A.J. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 32: 325-340Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) cannot be accounted for by disruption of L1's adhesive function alone, but is likely to also involve interactions with extracellular ligands and intracellular signaling pathways linked to cytoskeletal elements (3Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Brümmendorf T. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, L1 family CAMs have an array of different protein domains that in addition to participating in homophilic interactions also function in heterophilic interactions with other CAMs, integrins, and extracellular matrix proteins (1Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 3Hortsch M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).The diversity in the structure and potential functional repertoire of neural CAMs is further amplified with the existence of many splice variants and various post-translational modifications such as differential glycosylation and proteolytic processing (11Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene. Expr. 1997; 7: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem.

There is a growing body of evidence that secreted forms of both type I and type II integral membrane proteins including CAMs, growth factor and cytokine receptors, and receptor ligands are derived from selective post-translational proteolysis (14Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The biological function of the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane proteins is still not well characterized and may vary. In some cases it may be a process for rapidly down-regulating the protein from the cell surface, in others it may be to generate a soluble form of the protein that has functional properties different than those of the membrane-bound form (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In some cases the processing may be necessary for biological activity. For example, in order to generate a functional Notch receptor inDrosophila the protein is cleaved constitutively by a furin convertase (15Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israël A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) to form a disulfide-linked heterodimer (16Pan D. Rubin G.M.

Furthermore, loss-of-function mutations in the kuzbaniangene, which codes for a disintegrin metalloprotease inDrosophila embryos show that its proteolytic activity is required for axonal extension (18Fambrough D.F.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that ectodomain shedding of human and mouse L1 can promote cell migration by binding of the secreted ectodomain to integrins (19Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P.

We have provided evidence that the ectodomain of Tractin is constitutively cleaved by a furin-like convertase at a dibasic cleavage site conserved in many L1 family member CAMs. We further demonstrate that the shedded ectodomain can be tethered to the membrane by binding to the cleaved transmembrane fragment and that this interaction promotes homophilic adhesion. We propose that this novel mechanism may be a general feature for tethering the NH2-terminal domain of L1 family CAMs generated by cleavage at this site to the membrane.MATERIALS AND METHODSExperimental PreparationsFor the present experiments we used the two hirudinid leech species Hirudo medicinalis and Haemopis marmorata. The leeches were either captured in the wild or purchased from commercial sources. Dissections of nervous tissue were performed in leech saline solutions with the following composition (in mm): 110, NaCl; 4, KCl; 2, CaCl2; 10, glucose; 10, HEPES; pH. 7.4.AntibodiesThe previously reported Tractin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), Laz6-56, 4G5, 3A11, and 3A12 (20Flaster M.S.

Acta. 2000; 1479: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were used in these studies. In addition a new antibody, 1H4, was made to a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the PGYG domain of Tractin in the pGEX vector system (Amersham Biosciences) encompassing the sequence Thr1184–Pro1662. The correct orientation and frame of the construct was verified by sequencing the insert. The fusion protein was expressed in XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene), harvested, and purified over glutathione-agarose (Sigma) columns according to standard protocols (Amersham Biosciences). Balb C mice were injected with 50 μg of the purified fusion proteins at 21-day intervals. After the third boost spleen cells of the mice were fused with Sp2 myeloma cells and monospecific hybridoma lines established using standard procedures (23Harlow E. Lane E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). All procedures for monoclonal antibody production were performed by the Iowa State University Hybridoma facility. V5 and Fc antibody were obtained from commercial sources (Invitrogen and ICN, respectively).Full-length and Tractin Deletion ConstructsA full-length Tractin construct (M1-V1880) was cloned into the pMT/V5-HisB vector (Invitrogen) using standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A series of deletions of this construct were made in the pMT/V5-HisB vector: ΔAc with the acidic domain deleted from Pro1089–Pro1161, ΔPGYG with the PGYG domain deleted from Gly1197–Leu1656, and ΔAc/PGYG with both the acidic and the PGYG domains deleted from Pro1089–Leu1656. These constructs contain an in-frame V5 tag at the COOH-terminal end. In addition, a series of NH2-terminal sequence deletion constructs were cloned into the pMT/BiP/V5-HisB vector (Invitrogen), which contains theDrosophila BiP secretion signal to ensure the proper processing of the expressed proteins in transfected S2 cells. The CTF construct contained the sequence of Ser905–Val1880 after the first cleavage site, the ΔIg/FN1-3 construct contained the sequence of Pro957–Val1880 after the third FNIII domain, and the ΔIg/FN construct contained the remaining sequence of Pro1092–Val1880 after the fourth FNIII domain. Full-length Tractin (M1-V1880) was also cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for mammalian cell transfections in LoVo (ATCC) and HEK293T (Genehunter) cells. For expression in COS cells (ATCC) the NH2-terminal fragment of Tractin from M1-K890 was ligated in-frame to a human IgG Fc fragment (AF150959) in the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) resulting in the NH2-terminal fragment (NTF)-Fc fusion construct. For control experiments the Fc fragment alone was also cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. For SDS-PAGE mobility comparisons a GST fusion protein containing the sequences of the acidic and the PGYG domain (Glu1093–Thr1660) was made and expressed in the pGEX vector system (Amersham Biosciences) as described above. In addition, a full-length Tractin construct where the sequence RKRRSR was changed to AAAASA was generated by PCR mutagenesis using standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The fidelity of all constructs was verified by sequencing at the Iowa State University Sequencing Facility.Expression of Tractin Constructs in Transfected CellsDrosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells were grown in Shields and Sang M3 insect medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. S2 cells were transfected with Tractin cDNA clones using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen). Stable lines of each Tractin subclone were established by co-transfection with pCoHYGRO (Invitrogen) to confer hygromycin resistance. The stable lines were maintained with 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) in the culture medium. The expression of Tractin subclones was induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4. COS cells and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. LoVo cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS, HEK293T, and LoVo cells were plated overnight to reach 80% confluence and transiently transfected with Tractin/pcDNA3.1, NTF-Fc/pcDNA3.1, or Fc/pcDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells expressing Tractin or modified versions of Tractin were harvested 24–48 h after transfection and pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. For some experiments the supernatant was collected for further analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The pellet was resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 10 min before centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. In some cases the samples were additionally sonicated. The resulting supernatant was collected and analyzed with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. NTF-Fc and Fc protein for cell aggregation assays in cultured S2 cells was obtained by harvesting NTF-Fc- or Fc-expressing COS cells 48 h after transfection. The cells were resuspended and sonicated in S2 cell culture medium at 5 × 106 cells/ml. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and applied to cultured S2 cells expressing various Tractin deletion constructs for cell aggregation analysis. The levels of NTF-Fc and Fc protein in the lysate were verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Biochemical AnalysisSDS-PAGE and ImmunoblottingSDS-PAGE was performed according to standard procedures (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Electroblot transfer was performed as in Towbin et al. (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar) with 1× buffer containing 20% methanol and in most cases including 0.04% SDS. For these experiments we used the Bio-Rad MiniPROTEAN II system, electroblotting to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose, and using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) (1:3000) for visualization of primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in Blotto. The signal was developed with DAB (0.1 mg/ml) and H2O2 (0.03%) and enhanced with 0.008% NiCl2 or visualized using chemiluminescent detection methods (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblots were digitized using an Arcus II scanner (AGFA).ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C. Dissected Hemopis leech nerve cord were homogenized in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.4 containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin from Sigma and the homogenate (20 μl) incubated with the nonspecific mouse IgG conjugated to protein G beads for 2 h. The resulting supernatant was then incubated with anti-Tractin antibody conjugated to protein G beads (10 μl) overnight. For immunoprecipitations from Tractin construct expressing S2 cell lines the cells were harvested and sonicated in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin. Appropriate amounts of antibody were conjugated to 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 2 h on ice. In the case of immunoprecipitations from S2 cell culture medium the cell medium was incubated with antibody-conjugated protein G-Sepharose beads overnight. After a brief spin for 20 s at 2000 rpm the supernatant was discarded and the immunoaffinity matrix resuspended and washed three times with 400 μl of extraction buffer for 15 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before centrifugation and analysis of the supernatant by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.For co-immunoprecipitation experiments with Tractin deletion constructs Laz6-56 antibody was conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads as described above. The resulting Laz6-56-conjugated immunobeads were then incubated for 12 h with 400 μl of culture medium obtained from S2 cells that had expressed full-length Tractin for 12 h. After a brief spin for 20 s at 2000 rpm the supernatant was discarded and the immunobeads resuspended and washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunobeads were then incubated with 200 μl of lysate from ΔIgFN, ΔIgFN1–3, and CTF construct expressing S2 cells for 12 h. The resulting immunoprecipitate was processed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above.Biotinylation AssaysS2 cells transfected with the Tractin/pMT-V5 construct were induced with 0.5 mCuSO4 for 24 h and subsequently washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0). Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in PBS (pH 8.0). Sulfo-NHS-LS-Biotin (Pierce) was added to cells at 1 mg/ml or mock treated for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove any remaining biotinylation reagent. The cells were sonicated in immunoprecipitation buffer as described above at a concentration of 5 × 107cells/ml. The extracts were precleared with protein G beads at 4 °C for 2 h, and the precleared extracts were directly immunoprecipitated with 1H4 antibody conjugated to protein G-Sepharose matrix or incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The next day the beads were washed three times for 10 min with immunoprecipitation buffer at 4 °C. Then the beads were boiled in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Furin InhibitionFor furin convertase inhibition studies decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (cmk) (Bachem, Switzerland) was added to S2 cells expressing the full-length Tractin construct for a final concentration of 50 mm. The cells were induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4 and grown for 12 h before harvesting and analysis as described above.Cell Adhesion AssaysCell aggregation assays were carried out essentially as described in Hortsch et al. (27Hortsch M. O'Shea K.S. Zhao G. Kim F. Vallejo Y. Dubreuil R.R. Cell Adhesion Comm. 1998; 5: 61-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, S2 cells expressing Tractin constructs were plated in 6-well culture dishes at 1.0 × 106 cells/ml, induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4, and grown for 12 h before the cells were aggregated for 2 h at room temperature on a shaking platform at 100 rpm. Digital images of the aggregated cells were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope using a Paultek digital camera. To investigate the role of the interaction between NTF-Fc and CTF in cell adhesion, CTF and ΔIgFN construct-expressing S2 cells were plated at 1.0 × 106 cells/ml. For experimental cultures 100 μl/ml of NTF-Fc lysate obtained from NTF-Fc-expressing COS cells as described above were added. For control cell cultures 100 μl/ml of untransfected COS cell lysate were added. The cells were induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4 and grown for 12 h, and aggregation assays were carried out as described above. For quantification a digital image of a field in the middle of each well was obtained, and the number of aggregates containing more than 10 cells were counted. The difference in the number of aggregates found in experimental and control wells was compared using a Student's t test. In some control experiments 100 μl/ml of lysate from Fc-expressing COS cells were added as described above. That equivalent levels of Fc and NTF-Fc expression were obtained was verified by immunoblotting and labeling with Fc antibody.For homophilic interaction assays Tractin-transfected S2 cells were labeled with DiI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were incubated with 2 μl of 2 mg/ml DiI solution for each milliliter of culture medium at room temperature for 1 h before the cells were washed three times with fresh medium to remove excess dye. Untransfected S2 cells were labeled with DiO using Vybrant DiO cell labeling solution (Molecular Probes). 5 μl of the DiO solution were added for each milliliter of culture medium at room temperature for 1 h before the cells were washed three times with fresh medium. DiI- and DiO-labeled cells were mixed at 1:1 to a final concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml. The cell mixture was induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4 and grown for 12 h, and aggregation assays carried out as described above. Images of the labeled preparations were obtained on a Zeiss Axioskop equipped with the appropriate filter sets and a Paultek digital camera.ImmunohistochemistryTractin-expressing S2 cells were affixed to polylysine-coated slides and fixed for 2 h in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The slides were incubated 3 h at room temperature with diluted antibody in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 and 0.005% sodium azide, washed in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (ICN, 1:200 dilution). After three washes in PBS the fluorescently labeled preparations were mounted in glycerol with 5% n-propyl gallate. A confocal series of images for each of the labeled preparations were obtained with a Leica confocal TCS NT microscope at 1-μm intervals using the appropriate laser lines and filter sets.RESULTSFig. 1 A shows a diagram of the domain structure of Tractin. It contains 6 Ig domains, 4 FNIII-like domains, an acidic domain, 12 repeats of a novel collagen-like proline- and glycine-rich sequence motif, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail with an ankyrin and a PDZ domain binding motif (21Huang Y. Jellies J. Johansen K.M. Johansen J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Jie C., Xu, Y. Wang D. Luiken D. Zipser B. Jellies J. Johansen K.M. Johansen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of Tractin is 198 kDa; however, antibodies to the NH2-terminal sequence of Tractin recognized only a 130-kDa glycosylated fragment on standard immunoblots (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, antibodies to the fourth FNIII- and acidic domains and the PGYG-repeat domain (mAb 3A11, mAb 1H4) both recognize a doublet of bands of ∼165 and 185 kDa whereas an antibody to the intracellular domain (mAb 3A12) recognized only the higher 185-kDa band (Fig. 1 B). This and observations with other domain-specific antibodies suggest that Tractin is cleaved at two sites (Fig. 1 A, arrows), one in the third FNIII domain, and one just proximal to the transmembrane domain (22Jie C., Xu, Y. Wang D. Luiken D. Zipser B. Jellies J. Johansen K.M. Johansen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Previously, a full-length version of the Tractin protein has not been observed on immunoblots of leech central nervous system proteins (21Huang Y. Jellies J. Johansen K.M. Johansen J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,22Jie C., Xu, Y. Wang D. Luiken D. Zipser B. Jellies J. Johansen K.M. Johansen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); however, on greatly overloaded gels the same faint band corresponding to the expected size for the unprocessed protein can be detected with different domain-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 C). The several hundred-fold ratio of cleaved fragments to full-length protein indicate that Tractin is constitutively post-translationally processed in the leech central nervous system.Expression and Processing of Tractin in the S2 Cell LineTo study the processing of Tractin and to determine the ability of Tractin to mediate homophilic and/or heterophilic interactions we transfectedDrosophila S2 cells with Tractin expression constructs under the control of a metallothionein promoter. Fig. 2 shows diagrams of the full-length and the various truncated Tractin constructs with COOH-terminal V5 epitopes employed in these studies. In addition, we generated an Fc fusion construct of the NTF from the starting methionine to the first cleavage site (Fig. 2). Stably transfected S2 cell lines were obtained for the full-length construct as well as for the deletion constructs. Interestingly, the cell line expressing full-length Tractin cleaves Tractin in a pattern identical to that observed in leech nerve cords (compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 1 B). In immunoblots of cell lysate-containing cell membranes, antibodies to the COOH-terminal part of Tractin (3A11 and V5) recognize a 180-kDa band whereas antibodies to the NH2-terminal fragment (Laz6-56) recognize a 110-kDa band (Fig. 3 A). As a consequence of artificial overexpression in the cell culture the full-length protein migrating at ∼290 kDa is relatively more abundant under these conditions than in the in vivo situation (Fig. 3 A). The 110-kDa NH2-terminal fragment is found both in the medium and cell lysate (Fig. 3, A andB). In contrast, the 160-kDa band is only found secreted into the medium and is not recognized by antibodies to either the NH2-terminal fragment or the intracellular domain (Fig. 3 B). That the molecular masses of these bands do not precisely correspond to those from leech nerve cords is due to differences in glycosylation in the S2 cell line and the added V5 tag.Figure 2Diagram of Tractin deletion and expression constructs. The full-length and the COOH-terminal deletion constructs have an in-frame V5 tag (V5), whereas the NTF construct was fused to an Fc tag (Fc). The different domains of Tractin are indicated above the figure:Ig, immunoglobulin domains; FN, FNIII domains;Ac, acidic domain; PGYG, PGYG collagen-like domain; TM, transmembrane domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Proteolytic processing of a full-length Tractin construct in stably transfected S2 cells. A, immunoblot of S2 cell lysate that includes cell membranes. The Tractin construct is tagged with the V5 epitope at the COOH-terminal end. Full-length Tractin is detected as an ∼280-kDa band with both Laz6-56, 3A11, and V5 antibody, the COOH-terminal transmembrane fragment as a 180-kDa band by 3A11 and V5 antibody, whereas the NH2-terminal fragment is detected as a 110-kDa band by the mAb Laz6-56. That the NH2-terminal fragment is found in the cell lysate suggests that it is tethered to the cell surface.B, immunoblot of cell medium from S2 cells expressing full-length Tractin. In the cell medium the secreted middle fragment is detected as a 160-kDa band by mAb 3A11 whereas the secreted form of the NH2-terminal fragment is detected as a 110-kDa band by mAb Laz6-56. No V5-tagged fragments of Tractin are detected in the cell medium by V5 antibody. The migration of molec"

Bel1 directly binds to and activates DNA target sites of viral promoters and those of distinct cellular genes. To determine the contribution of cellular transcription factors to viral transactivation, the viral internal promoter (IP) was analyzed by transient expression, electrophoretic mobility shift assays), and supershifts. Here we report that Bel1-mediated transactivation of the full-length and shortened versions of the Bel1 response element (BRE) were repressed by nuclear factor I (NFI). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from transfected 293T cells revealed that different DNA-protein complexes consisting of DNA target sites of NFI and Bel1 proteins were formed.

The viral transactivators specifically recruit components of the cellular transcription machinery to viral promoters so that cellular transcription programs are specifically affected and even reprogrammed in a way favorable for viral replication (7Coffin J.M.

A key regulator of viral gene expression, the Bel1 transactivator of the human foamy virus (HFV), recently renamed primate foamy virus) binds directly to DNA target sites with no or low sequence conservation that are located in both the 5′-long terminal repeat (LTR) and the internal promoter (IP) (8Rethwilm A. Curr. Top. Micobiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 1-24Google Scholar, 9He F. Blair W.S. Fukushima J. Cullen B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3902-3908Google Scholar, 10Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J.

The IP is a strong early promoter that is crucial for viral replication and critically dependent on Bel1 (11Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. Levy J.A. The Retroviridae. Plenum Press, New York1995: 239-292Google Scholar, 12Löchelt M. Muranyi W. Flügel R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7317-732113Google Scholar, 13Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. Aboud M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 638-645Google Scholar). Expression of Bel1 is initiated at the IP until threshold levels of the Bel1 transactivator are reached which subsequently turn on the 5′-LTR promoter to direct synthesis of virus structural proteins (13Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. Aboud M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 638-645Google Scholar, 14Löchelt M. Yu S.F. Linial M. Flügel R.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 601-610Google Scholar, 15Meyering C.D. Rubio C. May C. Linial M.L.

The transactivator Tas of simian foamy virus type 1 binds to corresponding proximal and distal DNA target sites directly that are not homologous to the Bel1 response element (BRE) of the IP (16Zou J.X. Luciw P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 326-330Google Scholar). Bell 1 was shown to be a nuclear protein (17Keller A. Partin K.M. Löchelt M. Bannert H. Flügel R.M. Cullen B.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2589-2594Google Scholar, 18Bodem J. Löchelt M. Zemba M. Flügel R.M. Virology. 1998; 251: 22-27Google Scholar) that contains at least two domains, a centrally located DNA binding region and a C-terminal activation domain (19He F. Sun S.D. Garrett E.D. Cullen B.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1896-1904Google Scholar). Bel1 has a molecular size of 36 kDa (20Löchelt M. Zentgraf H. Flügel R.M. Virology. 1991; 184: 43-54Google Scholar) and can dimerize and multimerize (21Chang J. Lee K.J. Jang K.L. Lee E.K. Baek G.H. Sung Y.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 801-808Google Scholar). Alignments of Bel1 and Tas proteins from different species result in a remarkably low degree of homology of about 17–237 (22Winkler I. Bodem J. Haas L. Zemba M. Delius H. Flower R. Flügel R.M. Löchelt M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6727-6741Google Scholar). The minimal IP.BRE of 27 bp is capable of directly binding Bel1 and partial transactivation in vitro compared with the full-length IP of 192 bp. High affinity DNA binding of Bel1 and full transactivation of the IP depend upon as yet unidentified cellular factors. Previously, a Kip2-BRE DNA element located within the second exon of the human p57Kip2 gene was identified that mediates a specific Bel1 transactivation (23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the Kip2-BRE primarily consists of direct repeats of three 14 mers that partially overlap with the G base pattern conserved in both the IP.BRE and Kip2-BRE (10Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Google Scholar, 23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar). The Kip2-BRE was bound by proteins in nuclear extracts from 293T cells that had been transfected with Bel1 as shown by EMSA and supershift experiments. A purified glutathioneS-transferase-Bel1 fusion protein was bound specifically to Kip2-BRE, and the formation of the Bel1-Kip2-BRE complexes was effectively blocked by the minimal viral IP.BRE oligonucleotide (10Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Google Scholar, 23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar). Cotransfection with Sp1 expression plasmids enhanced the Bel1-specific transactivation of Kip2-BRE to a limited extent. 2K. Kido and R. M. Flügel, unpublished observation.2K. Kido and R. M. Flügel, unpublished observation. In the present study we aimed to identify cellular transcription factors and their DNA targets that either repress or activate Bel1-mediated transactivation of the viral internal promoter. We analyzed the ability of cellular transcription factors to affect the level of Bel1-driven transactivation with the clear focus on the core IP element from −166 to −116. Our investigations revealed that nuclear factor I (NFI) proteins negatively regulate spumaviral transactivation by binding to distinct core IP DNA target sites. Cotransfection of the infectious HFV DNA genome with a human NFI-X1 expression vector into two different human cell lines almost completely abolished viral gene expression. Human 293T cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 17 penicillin and streptomycin and 107 fetal calf serum. Plasmids pUC18, pCMVॆ-gal, pbel1s (24Venkatesh L.K. Yang C. Theodorakis P.A. Chinnadurai G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 161-169Google Scholar), pGL3-basic-HFV-IP (−192 to −1), pGL3-pro-IP.BRE −166 to −116 and −166 to −140 derivatives (23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar) were transfected into 293T cells using the coprecipitation method of Chen and Okayama (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). In general, 6 ॖg of plasmid DNA were transfected into 293T cells grown in 6-cm Petri dishes. The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 (ATCC number CCL-121) was propagated as described by the supplier and transfected using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). Reporter constructs containing the HFV internal promoter were constructed by PCR-mediated amplification of the defined promoter fragments. Sense primer was: IPs (−192 to −173), 5′-CGTCATGCTTTGGACTGGAC-3′; the antisense primer was: IPas (−1 to −22), 5′-GATAGATCTCAGCTTTTGCTCTTTCAATCTG-3′. PCR reactions using sense primer IPs and antisense primer IPas were done withPfu polymerase (Stratagene) and pHSRV13 (12Löchelt M. Muranyi W. Flügel R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7317-732113Google Scholar). PCR reactions were carried out with the buffer recommended by supplier supplemented for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, 2 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The resulting blunt-ended PCR amplicon was digested with BglII and inserted into the BglII- and Ecl136II-digested reporter plasmid pGL3 basic (Promega). The resulting reporter construct was designated pGL3-basic-HFV-IP. Separately, pGL3-promoter plasmids were constructed. The core IP.BRE (−166 to −116), 5′-AGGCCACTGGTTGCGGAAGAAAGATTGAGCTTTGAGCCACGACTGCCAA-3′ (or the IP.BRE from −166 to −140) was mixed with the corresponding antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, heat-denatured, annealed, and inserted intoEcl136II-digested luc reporter plasmid pGL3-promoter in the sense orientation. These plasmids were designated pGL3-pro-IP.BRE-166 to −116 or −160 to −140, respectively. EMSA experiments were performed according to Soto et al. (26Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Google Scholar, 27Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Google Scholar) and modified as described below. The probes used for EMSAs included the IP.BRE (Fig. 1B, line 3). The oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeled probe was purified by electrophoresis on a 157 polyacrylamide gel. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6420Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay (BioRad). The binding reaction was carried out with 2 ॖg of nuclear extracts that were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in a volume of 40 ॖl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 ng/ॖl poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (Amersham Biosciences) as indicated. Labeled DNA probe, 20,000 cpm, were added and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor oligodeoxynucleotides were added in 1000-fold molar excess at the preincubation period (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6420Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against Bel1 (23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar) and monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) used in supershift assays were added at a 1:80 dilution or 5 ng/ॖl respectively 30 min after addition of the labeled probe and further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Oligodeoxynucleotides FIB2.6, (Fig. 1B) and AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ were used in competition EMSAs (30Chaudhry A.Z. Vitullo A.D. Gronostajstaski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7072-7081Google Scholar). The DNA protein complexes were resolved in a 5.5 or 6.57 non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed for 4 h or overnight to Kodak BioMax MR1 films. Plasmid pCMVॆgal directing ॆ-galactosidase expression from the CMV-IE promoter was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. luc reporter gene assays were performed and quantified as described (23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar) using a Luminoskan TL Plus luminometer (Labsystems, Frankfurt, Germany). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 2 or 3 days after transfection by lysis in 17 SDS, and the protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay (BioRad). Identical amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, reacted with monoclonal serum directed against the HA epitope of the four different HA-tagged NFI proteins (Roche) or against hNFI-X1 protein (sc870X, Santa Crux), or polyclonal sera directed against Bel1/Bet, Gag, or RNase H proteins (23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously (23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar). The minimal HFV IP has been reported to comprise 27 bp but longer promoter regions showed higher activities when assayed by transient expression assays. In the first step of our analysis, we decided to use a longer IP that extends from −192 to the internal transcriptional start site of HFV (Fig. 1A). To analyze Bel1-mediated transactivation of the pGL3-HFV-IP, cotransfections with and without the eukaryotic expression plasmid pbel1s DNA were carried out. Since we had identified putative NFI binding sites within the IP, we tested the ability of NFI transcription factors to affect expression from the IP. The effect of human NFI-X1 (hNFI-X1) was determined by comparing the results of the normalized luc reporter assays in the presence and absence of hNFI-X1 expression (Fig.2A). These data show that hNFI-X1 repressed Bel1-driven transactivation by about 10-fold. Since vectors expressing the products of the four known human NFI genes were not available, this analysis was extended using well characterized vectors that express products of the four murine NFI genes. The results shown in Fig. 2B indicated that the four different NFI proteins, NFI-A1, -B2, -C2, and -X2, each inhibited the Bel1-mediated transactivation of the full-length promoter 4- to 6-fold (lower panel, Fig. 2B). In contrast, transfection of the four different NFI family members separately or alone did not affect the basal activity of the full-length IP.BRE (upper panel, Fig.2B). To assess expression levels of the Bel1 and NFI proteins, aliquots of nuclear extracts from transfected 293T cells were analyzed on Western blots. The results of immunoblotting showed that the expression levels of the four mouse (m) NFI, hNF-X1, and Bel1 proteins were similar under the conditions used (data not shown). This allowed us to compare the level of repression of hNFI-X1 to that of the mNFI-X2 (bottom lines in Fig. 2, A and B). Since this comparison showed that minor differences in repression were not due to differences in expression levels of the four mNFI and Bel1 proteins or to differences of the NFI-X protein sequences (30Chaudhry A.Z. Vitullo A.D. Gronostajstaski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7072-7081Google Scholar), we conclude that NFI-X1 and -X2 proteins from both species repressed Bel1-mediated transactivation to similar degrees. To determine more precisely the region of the IP that is responsible for the NFI-repressive effects, shorter regions of the internal promoter, two IP.BRE DNA fragments from positions −166 to −140 and −166 to −116 were cloned into the corresponding luc reporter plasmid pGL3-pro (Fig. 1A, broken and solid underlining, respectively). When the IP.BRE was shortened to the minimal IP.BRE of 27 bp encompassing the region from −166 to −140, the level of NFI-mediated repression of Bel1-driven transactivation decreased to a relatively very low level compared with the full-length internal promoter (Figs. 2 and3A). To further identify the region of the IP subject to repression by NFI-X, the longer core IP.BRE DNA from −166 to −116 was cloned into the pGL3-pro plasmid and cotransfected with pbel1s and phNFI-X1, and luciferase activity was subsequently determined. Bel1-dependent transactivation of the core IP was about 7-fold higher on the longer core IP.BRE compared with the minimal IP.BRE and was repressed to a much greater extent (Fig.3A and B). When luc reporter assays were done with the core IP as template and the four mNFI plasmids, similar levels of transactivation and repression were obtained after cotransfection with Bel1 (data not shown). We reasoned that the difference in the level of repression between the two different length promoters might be due to a putative additional NFI site 2 (s2) located close to the 3′-end of the IP.BRE at position −122 to −118 (Fig. 1). As the NFI-s2 GCCAA is a perfect consensus NFI half-site, we decided to subject the core IP.BRE from −166 to −116 to a more refined analysis of the repressive effect of NFI to gain more insight into the functional role of this region. To determine whether the longer core IP.BRE region is recognized by NFI proteins, EMSAs were carried out. Nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with vectors expressing NFI proteins, with or without Bel1, were prepared and incubated with the 32P-labeled IP.BRE (−166 to −116) oligodeoxynucleotide. In pilot experiments, we had observed that synthetic polymers poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) instead of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) markedly improved the detection of the different DNA-nuclear protein complexes. In nuclear extracts from Bel1-transfected cells, one intense and broad and another minor and slower migrating, Bel1-IP.BRE bands were clearly detectable (Fig.4A, lanes 3,5, 7, 9, 11, and13, long arrow marked Bel1). The minor Bel1-IP.BRE band of low intensity likely presents a complex consisting of Bel1, DNA, and an unknown endogenous nuclear protein migrating close to the NFI-C2-Bel1-DNA band (see below). Distinct bands were detected in nuclear extracts of cells transfected with vectors expressing mNFI-A1, -B2, -C2, -X2, and hNFI-X1 proteins in the absence of cotransfected Bel1 expression plasmid (Fig.4A, lanes 4, 6, 8,10, and 12 marked by vertical arrowsmarked A1, B2, C2, X2, andX1). After cotransfection with pbel1s, the four individual NFI protein-DNA complexes gave rise to an additional set of complexes with lower mobility (vertical arrows in Fig. 4A, marked A1+ Bel1, C2+ Bel1, X2 +Bel1, and X1+ Bel1). The partial shifts were concomitant with a slight decrease in intensity of the DNA-Bel1 complexes. The Bel1-DNA-NFI-X2 and -X1 complexes migrated as comparatively intense bands (lanes 11 and 13). In contrast, the NFI-B2-DNA complex became detectable only after longer exposure; however, a band corresponding to a Bel1-DNA-NFI-B2 complex was not observed (lane 7). Two additional bands observed in nuclear extracts from transfected cells are considered to be unspecific (lane 2) as reported previously (10Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Google Scholar, 23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar). These results indicate that the different NFI-A1, -C2, -X2, and -X1 proteins bound the core Bel1-IP.BRE DNA (−166 to −116) together with Bel1. To assess the presence of other potential protein-IP.BRE complexes, different conditions with varying buffers and copolymers were used. No evidence for any other complexes than those detected before and shown in Fig.4A was found. To confirm the specificity of the IP.BRE interaction with Bel1 and NFI proteins, a polyclonal Bel1-specific antibody and a monoclonal directed against the HA epitope of the four mNFI proteins was used in supershift assays (Fig. 4B). The intense bands of the Bel1-DNA complexes are marked by short arrows in lanes 3,4, 9, and 10. The HA and Bel1 antibodies unrelated to each other served as specificity controls (lanes 4 and 8). The EMSAs shown in Fig.4B indicate that in the presence of nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with Bel1, the two Bel1-oligonucleotide complexes reacted with antibody directed against Bel1 that resulted in a complete supershift to three bands (lane 5, short arrows marked Bel1 +αBel1, Fig. 4B) as reported previously (10Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Google Scholar, 23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar). Incubation with antibody against the HA epitope located at the N terminus of the NFI-X2 protein resulted in a supershift of the original NFI-X2-oligonucleotide complex to positions marked by the long arrow NFI-X2+αHA (lane 7,inset, lane 9 versus 10). The mobilities of the NFI-X2-DNA complexes (lanes 6,8, and 9) were slightly slower than the Bel1-DNA complexes in lanes 3, 4, 9, and10). In contrast, the NFI-X2-DNA complex resulted in a partial shift to a new position after cotransfection of the Bel1 expression plasmid (inset, lane 9). Clearly, the ternary NFI-X2-DNA-Bel1 complexes were shifted by addition of either anti-HA or anti-Bel1 antibodies (inset, lanes 9,10, and 11). Thus, we defined the upper band (lane 9) as a Bel1-DNA-NFI-X2 complex. Theuppermost band in lane 11 likely presents a DNA complex of NFI-X2 and Bel1-anti-Bel1 that migrated more slowly than the DNA complex of anti-HA-NFI-X2 and Bel1 (lane 10). Similar EMSA evidence of NFI-Bel1-DNA ternary complexes was obtained when the mNFI-C2 expression was used for transfection instead of mNFI-X2 (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of the EMSA assay and anti-HA and antiBel1 antibody supershifts, we carried out EMSA and supershift experiments with a 32P-labeled FIB2.6 oligodeoxynucleotide. FIB 2.6 was reported to bind specifically to NFI proteins with very high affinity (31Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9117-9131Google Scholar). The results of the binding assays in Fig. 4C clearly show that with nuclear extracts from 293 cells cotransfected with Bel1 alone, FIB2.6 was incapable of binding to Bel1 (lanes 3–5). Expression of Bel1 did not lead to any new band (lanes 9–11) even after reaction with Bel1-specific antibodies (lane 11). Both proteins, mNFI-X2 and Bel1, were expressed as confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). The absence of any band shift in lanes 9 and 11 indicates that direct NFI-Bel1 protein interactions are not detected. To determine whether distinct oligonucleotides were able to act as competitors for the formation of the different nuclear protein-IP.BRE complexes, the following oligonucleotides were used: unlabeled core IP.BRE (−166 to −116), FIB2.6 (Fig. 1B) shown previously to strongly bind NFI in vitro (31Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9117-9131Google Scholar) and an unrelated AP-1 site (sequence under 舠Experimental Procedures舡) in the presence of excess of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT). In nuclear extracts from Bel1-transfected cells one major and a minor DNA-Bel1 complex were formed (Fig.5A, lanes 3,5, and 6). The data shown in Fig. 5Arevealed that unlabeled core IP.BRE (−166 to −116) functioned as effective competitor for both the major and minor DNA-Bel1 complexes (lanes 4 and 12) almost as well as for the DNA-NFI-X2 complexes (lanes 8 and 12). It is noteworthy that the unlabeled 26-bp FIB2.6 oligonucleotide effectively competed for the NFI-X2-DNA complex (lanes 9 and13) but not for Bel1-DNA complex (lane 5). Interestingly, the proposed ternary NFI-X2-Bel1-DNA complex was effectively competed out by FIB2.6 (Fig. 5A, lane 13 versus lane 11). FIB2.6 partially blocked the formation of the minor IP.BRE-Bel1 complex (lanes 5 and13). These results indicate that most or all of the upper band in lane 11 contained a NFI protein. By analogy, the modest decrease in intensity of the slowest migrating DNA-Bel1* complex suggests that an endogenous NFI protein may be part of this complex (lanes 5 and 13 compared with lanes 3and 6). These data are in agreement with the results obtained in the supershift assay (Fig. 4B, lane 10). The unrelated AP-1 oligonucleotide did not act as competitor for either of the nuclear protein-DNA complexes as anticipated. The data argue for a specific interaction of the NFI DNA binding sites s1 and s2 of the IP.BRE with NFI proteins. In an effort to further delineate the contributions of individual NFI DNA binding sites to DNA-NFI complex formation, we used an unlabeled 27-bp-long IP.NFI DNA from −142 to −116 as competitor. In addition, three IP.BRE mutants, DNAs of five different NFI sites, and two IP.BREs were used tested for competition (for sequences, see Fig. 1,A and B). The core IP.BRE was used as labeled probe. As shown in Fig. 5B, lane 6, the core IP.BRE was capable of inhibiting formation of the DNA-NFI-X2 complex. In contrast, the minimal IP.BRE (−166–140), IP.BRE mutant 1, and oligonucleotides representing the NFI DNA binding sites s1–s6 did not block formation of the DNA-NFI-X2 complexes (lanes 4,9–13 versus 3). Intriguingly, the IP.NFI (lane 8) was the more effective competitor pointing to an essential role of NFI-s2 or another site that resides in the flanking sequences. A role of NFI-s2 was revealed by the ability of IP.BRE.M2 (lane 6) to compete with the IP.BRE. IP.BRE.M2 contains a mutation in the NFI-s2, which resulted in a detectable competition although slightly less effective than that of the native core IP.BRE (Fig. 5B). To more precisely determine the roles of the potential NFI sites s2 and s7, a double mutant, IP.BRE mutant 3 that contains an additional mutation at s7, was used as competitor (Fig. 1B). It is revealing that the double mutant had almost completely lost its ability to act as competitor (Fig. 5B,lane 7) when compared with IP.BRE −166 to −116 (lane 5). We conclude that the NFI-s2 and -s7 sites play more important roles than the NFI-s1 DNA binding site. To determine the in vivo relevance of NFI-dependent repression, the infectious pHSRV13 DNA plasmid (12Löchelt M. Muranyi W. Flügel R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7317-732113Google Scholar) was transfected with and without the hNFI-X1 expression plasmid into two different cell lines. Immunoblotting of cellular extracts revealed that pHSRV13-transfected cells expressed the viral structural proteins Gag and Pol (Fig. 6,A and B). The viral Gag proteins p70 and p68 migrated as a characteristic double band (marked by thearrow in Fig. 6A) as reported previously (11Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. Levy J.A. The Retroviridae. Plenum Press, New York1995: 239-292Google Scholar, 14Löchelt M. Yu S.F. Linial M. Flügel R.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 601-610Google Scholar), and their expression levels decreased upon cotransfection with the NFI-X1 expression plasmid. The known HFV Pol proteins p127 and p65 (11Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. Levy J.A. The Retroviridae. Plenum Press, New York1995: 239-292Google Scholar) were detected by an anti-RNase H serum (marked by two arrows in B). In extracts from cells cotransfected with hNFI-X1, the relative amounts of these Pol proteins were substantially decreased (as marked by arrows in lanes 2,4, and 6). Importantly, the cellular lysates expressed the 36-kDa Bel1 protein after transfection with pHSRV13 as determined with an anti-Bel1/Bet serum (Fig. 6C,lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, in cellular extracts from 293T cells cotransfected with hNFI-X1 the relative amount of Bel1 protein strongly decreased (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 1 and 3 withlanes 2 and 4). Taken together, the results indicate that in cell cultures that overexpress NFI-X1 proteins, expression of Bel1 was down-regulated in agreement with our transfection data. The present report indicates that NFI-mediated repression of Bel1-driven transactivation and gene expression involves the interaction of NFI transcription factors with the retroviral internal promoter core IP.BRE. This report is the first that describes the identification of a cellular transcription factor that negatively regulates Bel1-mediated transactivation of the core IP.BRE in vitro and in cell cultures. This promoter is transactivated by Bel1, the key regulator of viral expression (7Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1997: 225-230Google Scholar, 11Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. Levy J.A. The Retroviridae. Plenum Press, New York1995: 239-292Google Scholar, 12Löchelt M. Muranyi W. Flügel R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7317-732113Google Scholar, 13Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. Aboud M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 638-645Google Scholar, 14Löchelt M. Yu S.F. Linial M. Flügel R.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 601-610Google Scholar). In transiently transfected 293T cells, different NFI proteins specifically repressed the level of Bel1-driven transactivation as assessed by luc expression assays. The level of activation and repression was dependent on the size of the promoter region. To gain insight into the mechanism of repression, we focused on the core IP.BRE region from −166 to −116 that allowed us to define the roles of NFI and Bel1 proteins in DNA binding by carrying out EMSAs, supershifts, and competition EMSAs. Several groups have reported that Bel1 binds its target sequence directly (10Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Google Scholar, 16Zou J.X. Luciw P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 326-330Google Scholar, 23Kido K. Doerks A. Löchelt M. Flügel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12032-12039Google Scholar). The minimal IP.BRE of 27 bp seems to be the one with a high DNA binding affinity compared with the corresponding LTR BRE (10Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Google Scholar). Our data show that the minimal IP.BRE of 27 bp was transactivated by Bel1 to a limited extent, but it did not efficiently bind NFI proteins. Accordingly, the levels of NFI-mediated repression were relatively low when the minimal IP.BRE was used. In contrast, the core IP.BRE possessed both higher transactivation activity and stronger NFI binding activity as assessed by luc assays and competition EMSAs. Thus, the functional and DNA binding properties of NFI are consistent for both IP.BREs. Apparently, the minimal region for optimal NFI repressor activity resides within the core IP.BRE. It is well known that NFI proteins can act as either activators or repressors depending on the transcriptional context. The complex roles of the NFI gene products in transcription and development have been reviewed (33Gronostajski R.M. Gene. 2000; 249: 31-43Google Scholar, 34Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G. Gronostajstaski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Google Scholar). Expression of NFI proteins can modulate transcription by either transactivation or repression. To account for the multiple in vivo functions of NFI proteins, several models have been put forward (33Gronostajski R.M. Gene. 2000; 249: 31-43Google Scholar). As NFI proteins act as dimers, the models include (i) recruitment of coactivators, corepressors, or RNA polymerase components, (ii) displacement of activators, repressors, or nucleosomes, and (iii) cooperative recruitment by specific NFI isoforms of adjacent DNA binding proteins. Here we will focus the discussion on repression. NFI proteins contain a highly conserved ∼200-residue N-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain. The C-terminal domains of the proteins harbor both repression and transactivation domains including a Pro-rich domain (33Gronostajski R.M. Gene. 2000; 249: 31-43Google Scholar). There are multiple potential models to address the formation of the different NFI-Bel1 complexes. The first is that IP.BRE DNA binds Bel1 and NFI-X2 proteins cooperatively so that the transcriptional factors affect each other; i.e. once NFI protein is bound to its DNA target site, it then affects subsequent Bel1 binding in a way that repression of the Bel1-mediated activation is achieved. This would likely require that the two binding proteins interact directly with each other. Thus, the repressive effect of NFI would be due to affects on Bel1 protein binding. However, our data provided no evidence for any direct NFI-Bel1 interaction. An alternative hypothesis is that the core IP.BRE DNA binds the Bel1 and dimeric NFI-X2 proteins directly but independently at distinct but partially overlapping sites leading to a partial displacement of the Bel1 activator, particularly when NFI proteins were overexpressed. The presence of three different NFI half-sites within the core IP.BRE is in agreement with this assumption as it is well known that NFI proteins binds to half-sites as either homo- or heterodimers (35Gounari F. De Francesco R. Schmitt J. van der Vliet P.C. Cortese R. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 559-566Google Scholar). However again, our data did not indicate that NFI-X2 could displace Bel1 from the full or minimal IP. BRE. A third model would predict that NFI-X2 binds to the promoter in the presence of Bel1 and recruits corepressor molecules that abolish Bel1 activation of the promoter. This model proposes as yet unidentified corepressors that NFI-X2 might recruit to the promoter. The identification of such corepressors will be an important future task. Our data also revealed that one of the DNA-Bel1 complexes might contain unknown endogenous nuclear proteins as well as endogenous NFI proteins (Fig. 5A). In supershift assays, this complex resulted in a partial supershift to a slowly migrating NFI-DNA-Bel1 complex indicating the composite nature of the DNA complexes and the possible presence of both activator and repressor proteins. The influence of other known or unknown cellular transcription factors on Bel1 activation remains to be determined. We can, however, rule out a role for C/EBPα that neither activated nor repressed Bel1-mediated transactivation of the IP.BRE. 3K. Kido, H. Bannert, R. M. Gronostajski, and R. M.
