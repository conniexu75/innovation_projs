https://openalex.org/W2109727228,"Alzheimer's disease constitutes a rising threat to public health. Despite extensive research in cellular and animal models, identifying the pathogenic agent present in the human brain and showing that it confers key features of Alzheimer's disease has not been achieved. We extracted soluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers directly from the cerebral cortex of subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The oligomers potently inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), enhanced long-term depression (LTD) and reduced dendritic spine density in normal rodent hippocampus. Soluble Abeta from Alzheimer's disease brain also disrupted the memory of a learned behavior in normal rats. These various effects were specifically attributable to Abeta dimers. Mechanistically, metabotropic glutamate receptors were required for the LTD enhancement, and N-methyl D-aspartate receptors were required for the spine loss. Co-administering antibodies to the Abeta N-terminus prevented the LTP and LTD deficits, whereas antibodies to the midregion or C-terminus were less effective. Insoluble amyloid plaque cores from Alzheimer's disease cortex did not impair LTP unless they were first solubilized to release Abeta dimers, suggesting that plaque cores are largely inactive but sequester Abeta dimers that are synaptotoxic. We conclude that soluble Abeta oligomers extracted from Alzheimer's disease brains potently impair synapse structure and function and that dimers are the smallest synaptotoxic species."

We report that DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors improve reprogramming efficiency. In particular, valproic acid (VPA), an HDAC inhibitor, improves reprogramming efficiency by more than 100-fold, using Oct4-GFP as a reporter. VPA also enables efficient induction of pluripotent stem cells without introduction of the oncogene c-Myc."
https://openalex.org/W2093806717,"Nonlinear optics plays a central role in the advancement of optical science and laser-based technologies. We report on the confinement of the nonlinear interaction of light with matter to a single wave cycle and demonstrate its utility for time-resolved and strong-field science. The electric field of 3.3-femtosecond, 0.72-micron laser pulses with a controlled and measured waveform ionizes atoms near the crests of the central wave cycle, with ionization being virtually switched off outside this interval. Isolated sub-100-attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light (photon energy ∼ 80 electron volts), containing ∼0.5 nanojoule of energy, emerge from the interaction with a conversion efficiency of ∼10 –6 . These tools enable the study of the precision control of electron motion with light fields and electron-electron interactions with a resolution approaching the atomic unit of time (∼24 attoseconds)."
https://openalex.org/W1964727443,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, localization, and translation are largely determined by sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). We found a conserved increase in expression of mRNAs terminating at upstream polyadenylation sites after activation of primary murine CD4 + T lymphocytes. This program, resulting in shorter 3′UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3′UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3′UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2098590189,"The heart is formed from cardiogenic progenitors expressing the transcription factors Nkx2-5 and Isl1 (refs 1 and 2). These multipotent progenitors give rise to cardiomyocyte, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, the major lineages of the mature heart. Here we identify a novel cardiogenic precursor marked by expression of the transcription factor Wt1 and located within the epicardium-an epithelial sheet overlying the heart. During normal murine heart development, a subset of these Wt1(+) precursors differentiated into fully functional cardiomyocytes. Wt1(+) proepicardial cells arose from progenitors that express Nkx2-5 and Isl1, suggesting that they share a developmental origin with multipotent Nkx2-5(+) and Isl1(+) progenitors. These results identify Wt1(+) epicardial cells as previously unrecognized cardiomyocyte progenitors, and lay the foundation for future efforts to harness the cardiogenic potential of these progenitors for cardiac regeneration and repair."
https://openalex.org/W1989779456,"Tuberous sclerosis is a single-gene disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) gene and is frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy. Even individuals with tuberous sclerosis and a normal intelligence quotient (approximately 50%) are commonly affected with specific neuropsychological problems, including long-term and working memory deficits. Here we report that mice with a heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the Tsc2 gene (Tsc2(+/-) mice) show deficits in learning and memory. Cognitive deficits in Tsc2(+/-) mice emerged in the absence of neuropathology and seizures, demonstrating that other disease mechanisms are involved. We show that hyperactive hippocampal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling led to abnormal long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and consequently to deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning. These deficits included impairments in two spatial learning tasks and in contextual discrimination. Notably, we show that a brief treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in adult mice rescues not only the synaptic plasticity, but also the behavioral deficits in this animal model of tuberous sclerosis. The results presented here reveal a biological basis for some of the cognitive deficits associated with tuberous sclerosis, and they show that treatment with mTOR antagonists ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2017777683,"Genetic sequence alignment is the basis of many evolutionary and comparative studies, and errors in alignments lead to errors in the interpretation of evolutionary information in genomes. Traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard the phylogenetic implications of gap patterns that they create and infer systematically biased alignments with excess deletions and substitutions, too few insertions, and implausible insertion-deletion–event histories. We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the conventional picture of sequence evolution and mechanisms of functional and structural changes."
https://openalex.org/W2051962101,"The last two abrupt warmings at the onset of our present warm interglacial period, interrupted by the Younger Dryas cooling event, were investigated at high temporal resolution from the North Greenland Ice Core Project ice core. The deuterium excess, a proxy of Greenland precipitation moisture source, switched mode within 1 to 3 years over these transitions and initiated a more gradual change (over 50 years) of the Greenland air temperature, as recorded by stable water isotopes. The onsets of both abrupt Greenland warmings were slightly preceded by decreasing Greenland dust deposition, reflecting the wetting of Asian deserts. A northern shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone could be the trigger of these abrupt shifts of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, resulting in changes of 2 to 4 kelvin in Greenland moisture source temperature from one year to the next."
https://openalex.org/W1981403111,"The transcription factor IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) is required during an immune response for lymphocyte activation and the generation of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, has a complex molecular aetiology with several subgroups defined by gene expression profiling and recurrent chromosomal translocations. Moreover, the malignant clone can sustain multiple oncogenic lesions, accumulating genetic damage as the disease progresses. Current therapies for myeloma can extend survival but are not curative. Hence, new therapeutic strategies are needed that target molecular pathways shared by all subtypes of myeloma. Here we show, using a loss-of-function, RNA-interference-based genetic screen, that IRF4 inhibition is toxic to myeloma cell lines, regardless of transforming oncogenic mechanism. Gene expression profiling and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis uncovered an extensive network of IRF4 target genes and identified MYC as a direct target of IRF4 in activated B cells and myeloma. Unexpectedly, IRF4 was itself a direct target of MYC transactivation, generating an autoregulatory circuit in myeloma cells. Although IRF4 is not genetically altered in most myelomas, they are nonetheless addicted to an aberrant IRF4 regulatory network that fuses the gene expression programmes of normal plasma cells and activated B cells."

https://openalex.org/W2026175550,"α-Synuclein (ASYN) is crucial in Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis. Increased levels of wild type (WT) ASYN expression are sufficient to cause PD in humans. The manner of post-transcriptional regulation of ASYN levels is controversial. Previously, we had shown that WT ASYN can be degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in isolated liver lysosomes. Whether this occurs in a cellular and, in particular, in a neuronal cell context is unclear. Using a mutant ASYN form that lacks the CMA recognition motif and RNA interference against the rate-limiting step in the CMA pathway, Lamp2a, we show here that CMA is indeed involved in WT ASYN degradation in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells, and in primary cortical and midbrain neurons. However, the extent of involvement varies between cell types, potentially because of differences in compensatory mechanisms. CMA inhibition leads to an accumulation of soluble high molecular weight and detergent-insoluble species of ASYN, suggesting that CMA dysfunction may play a role in the generation of such aberrant species in PD. ASYN and Lamp2a are developmentally regulated in parallel in cortical neuron cultures and in vivo in the central nervous system, and they physically interact as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation. In contrast to previous reports, inhibition of macroautophagy, but not the proteasome, also leads to WT ASYN accumulation, suggesting that this lysosomal pathway is also involved in normal ASYN turnover.

Initial studies showed that ASYN accumulated in cells upon proteasomal inhibition, suggesting that the proteasome was responsible for ASYN degradation (5Bennett M.C. Bishop J.F. Leng Y. Chock P.B.

Other studies however, including our own, failed to detect accumulation of endogenous or overexpressed ASYN with proteasomal inhibition (9Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Ueda K. Checler F. Neurosci.

In contrast, ASYN appeared to accumulate with general lysosomal inhibition (12Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B.I. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J.

Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). In lysosomes, degradation of cytoplasmic components is achieved through distinct types of autophagic pathways as follows: chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), microautophagy, and macroautophagy (14Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar, 15Cuervo A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 70-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). CMA involves the selective targeting of proteins containing a KFERQ peptide motif to lysosomes. This requires binding to the lysosomal receptor, Lamp2a, the rate-limiting step in CMA (16Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 17Majeski A.E.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2420-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Microautophagy involves the pinocytosis of small quantities of cytosol directly by lysosomes (18Massey A. Kiffin R. Cuervo A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2420-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Muller O. Sattler T. Flotenmeyer M. Schwarz H. Plattner H. Mayer A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy involves the sequestration of cytosolic regions into autophagosomes that deliver their contents to late endosomal and lysosomal compartments for degradation (20Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). Direct assessment of the contribution of macroautophagy to WT ASYN degradation was performed in two studies using the selective macroautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). In both cases (7Webb J.L. Ravikumar B. Atkins J. Skepper J.N. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25009-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 8Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), 3-MA application failed to enhance ASYN levels, suggesting the lack of involvement of macroautophagy in normal ASYN turnover. ASYN contains the pentapeptide motif KFERQ that could target it to the CMA pathway. Analysis in an in vitro system of purified liver lysosomes confirmed that ASYN can be degraded by CMA. Coupled with cellular data, which indicated that rat ASYN is degraded in ventral midbrain cultures by a lysosomal pathway, we had proposed that CMA may be the major pathway used for WT ASYN degradation (13Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct proof that CMA is responsible for ASYN degradation in cells, and in particular neuronal cells; rather this hypothesis is based on the in vitro data with purified liver lysosomes and the exclusion of other degradation pathways. Therefore, molecular techniques targeted specifically toward CMA are needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis that CMA represents a major route for WT ASYN degradation in cellular systems. Ideally, such experiments should be performed in neuronal cells, and particularly those that are most relevant to PD. This is all the more prescient, as the rate-limiting step in CMA, the levels of Lamp2a, have been reported to be very low in the CNS (21Konecki D.S. Foetisch K. Zimmer K.P. Schlotter M. Lichter-Konecki U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Furuta K. Yang X.L. Chen J.S. Hamilton S.R. August J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have undertaken the present study to ascertain whether CMA is indeed responsible for WT ASYN degradation in neuronal cells. Because of the controversy surrounding the issues of proteasomal and macroautophagy-dependent degradation of WT ASYN, we have also examined the contribution of these pathways in various neuronal cell culture systems. Animals—Wistar rats and wild type control or double transgenic C57BI/C3H mice expressing human A53T ASYN under the control of the prion promoter were used. The generation and phenotype of these mice have been described previously (23Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed in the animal facility of the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens in a room with a controlled light-dark cycle (12 h light-12 h dark) and free access to food and water. For immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting experiments, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation; brains were harvested, dissected on ice to obtain the region of interest, and immediately frozen. All animals were processed in a similar manner. Tissue was stored at –80 °C until further use. Genotyping was performed by quantitative Southern dot blot analysis with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide-primed ASYN DNA probe as described previously (23Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of the animals used, according to the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens. Generation of Stable Cell Lines and Transfections—We generated the ΔDQ mutation in the ASYN open reading frame by substituting the amino acids DQ at positions 98–99 with AA, using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, as described previously (13Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Human ASYN in pcDNA3 was used as template (24Stefanis L. Larsen K.E. Rideout H.J. Sulzer D. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9549-9560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Naive SH-SY5Y cells were transfected overnight with the Tet-Off vector (10 μg) (Clontech) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Selection was performed with 500 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Growth medium was changed every 2 days. G418-resistant colonies were picked. Inducibility of each clone was determined by transient transfection of a pTRE-LUC vector, in the presence or absence of doxycycline (dox, 2 μg/ml) TET-approved medium (Clontech). Two clones were finally chosen for tight regulation. Maintenance of the clones was in 250 μg/ml G418. One of the clones was further used for generation of stable pTRE-ASYN expression as described below. Mutant ΔDQ/WT ASYN was generated by PCR from human WT ASYN. PCR products were then cloned into a TOPO-pCRII vector (Invitrogen). WT, ΔDQ/WT ASYN were subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the pTRE-tight vector (Clontech) and transfected along with the pTK-hygromycin vector (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer's recommendations. Selection was with 200 μg/ml G418 and 25 μg/ml (for PC12 cells) or 50 μg/ml (for SH-SY5Y cells) hygromycin B (Roche Diagnostics). Single colonies were isolated and maintained in medium with/without dox (2 μg/ml for PC12 or 3 μg/ml for SH-SY5Y cells) for 4 days. The clones were tested for ASYN expression by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Resistant clones were picked, and ASYN inducibility was examined by immunofluorescence in the presence or absence of dox (2 μg/ml added for 4 days) in Tet-Off approved medium using the monoclonal antibody Syn 211 sc-12767 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Clones with the tightest regulation were further confirmed by Western immunoblotting with the same antibody. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% horse serum (Biowest, Nuaillé, France) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biowest, France) on rat tail collagen-coated plates. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS. Stable cell lines were co-cultured with 200 μg/ml G418 and 25 μg/ml (for PC12 cells) or 50 μg/ml (for SH-SY5Y cells) hygromycin B. For pharmacological studies, 3-methyladenine (3-MA, Sigma), NH4Cl (Sigma), epoxomicin (epx, Sigma), and dox (Clontech) were added at indicated times and concentrations. Serum deprivation in SH-SY5Y cells was in RPMI 1640 medium + 0.5% FBS. All plasticware was from Greiner (Greiner, Bio One GmbH, Germany). RNAi—A 21-nucleotide, small interfering RNA was designed against the rat Lamp2a mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_017068) according to the criteria of Elbashir et al. (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar) and Reynolds et al. (26Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence targeting rat Lamp2a was 5′-AAGCGCCATCATACTGGATAT-3′ (L1) and was subjected to a BLAST search to verify specificity. As a control, we used a scrambled (scr) siRNA containing the 21-nucleotide sequence 5′-AATTTAGCCGATACTGCCTAG-3′. Briefly, PC12 cells were grown in 12-well dishes, and siRNAs (L1 and scr) at a concentration of 25 nm were delivered with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Six hours later, the medium was removed and replaced with normal culture medium. Lamp2a down-regulation was assessed 24 and 48 h post-transfection. Primary Neuronal Cultures—Cultures of rat (embryonic day 18, E18) or mouse (E16) cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (27Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J.

Dissociated cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well or 12-well dishes at a density of ∼150,000–200,000/cm2. Cells were maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), with B27 serum-free supplements (Invitrogen), l-glutamine (0.5 mm), and penicillin/streptomycin (1%). More than 98% of the cells cultured under these conditions represent post-mitotic neurons (11Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rat midbrain cultures derived from postnatal day 1 were prepared using standard procedures (13Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, material dissected form the ventral portion of the midbrain was cleaned free of meningeal tissue, minced, and enzymatically dissociated in a mixture of trypsin/DNase. Dissociated cells were plated at a density of ∼200,000 cells per cm2 on poly-d-lysine-coated plates. The neurons were maintained in neurobasal A medium with B27 serum-free supplements. Intracellular Protein Degradation—Total protein degradation in cultured cells (PC12 cells, cortical neurons) was measured by pulse-chase experiments (13Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T. Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 29Franklin J.L. Johnson E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, confluent PC12 cells or cortical neurons (day 7 in culture) were labeled with [3H]leucine (2 μCi/ml) (leucine, L-3,4,5; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 48 or 24 h respectively. The cultures were then extensively washed with medium and returned in complete growth medium containing 2 mm of unlabeled leucine for 6 h. This medium containing mainly short lived proteins was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing cold leucine, and/or the general lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl (30Hart P.D. Young M.R. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or the inhibitor of macroautophagy 3-MA (31Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) at indicated concentrations. Aliquots of the medium were taken at different times (14 h for PC12 cells and 12 and 24 h after labeling for cortical neurons), and proteins in the medium were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min on ice and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Radioactivity in the supernatant (representing degraded proteins) and pellet (representing undegraded proteins) was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac T414, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At the last time point, cells were lysed with 0.1% NaOH. Proteolysis was expressed as the percentage of the initial total acid-precipitable radioactivity (protein) in the cell lysates transformed to acid-soluble radioactivity (amino acids and small peptides) in the medium during the incubation. Total radioactivity incorporated in cellular proteins was determined in triplicate samples as the amount of acid-precipitable radioactivity in labeled cells. Measurement of Half-lives of WT (Endogenous and Over-expressed) and ΔDQ/WT Synucleins—85% confluent cell cultures were grown in methionine/cysteine-deprived RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) for 10 min and then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (0.2 mCi/ml) (Express Labeling Mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h. For cortical neurons the radiolabeling was performed for 24 h in Neurobasal medium without previous amino acid starvation. After extensive washing with medium, cells were maintained in complete or serum-deprived medium (0.5% FBS) and at the indicated times lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% deoxycholate) with protease inhibitors (complete mini, Roche Diagnostics) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody against ASYN. The antibodies used were the sc-7011 (C-20) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells and the monoclonal Syn 1 antibody (BD Biosciences) for cortical cultures. Protein G+-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%), and the gels were dried and then exposed on a PhosphorImager Screen and quantified using Gel Analyzer version 1.0 software (Biosure, Greece). Western Immunoblotting—PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, and primary neurons were washed twice in cold PBS and then harvested in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The detergent-insoluble pellets were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. Protein concentrations in soluble fractions were determined using the Bradford or Lowry methods (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels or 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with antibodies directed against the following: 1) ASYN, monoclonal Syn 1 (1:1000; BD Biosciences), polyclonal C20 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 2) polyclonal Lamp2a (Igp96), (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.); 3) monoclonal Lamp1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 4) polyclonal ERK (loading control; 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 5) monoclonal GAPDH (1:1000; Chemicon); 6) monoclonal ubiquitin (1:750; Chemicon); 7) monoclonal GFP (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 8) monoclonal β-actin (1:20,000; Sigma); and 9) polyclonal TH (1:1000, Chemicon). Blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), visualized with Western Lightning® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to Super RX film (Fuji Film). After scanning the images, the intensity of each immunoreactive band was estimated by densitometric quantification using the Gel Analyzer version 1.0 software. Immunocytochemistry—Cortical or ventral midbrain neurons grown on 24-well plates were fixed in freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde for 45 min. Blocking was with 10% normal goat serum, 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse anti-ASYN (1:200; BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 1:500; Calbiochem) antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (mouse Cy3, 1:250; rabbit Cy2, 1:150, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added for 1 h. The fluorescent marker Hoechst 33258 (1 μm; Sigma) was used to assess cell nuclei. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cortical neurons 48 and 72 h after infection with the lentiviruses bearing the L1 or the scrambled siRNAs using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was generated with the reverse transcription system (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the cDNA as template. All primer pairs were optimized to be in the log -exponential phase of amplification. The following primers were used: 1) ASYN-forward, ttctgcggaagcctagagag, and ASYN-reverse, tcctccaacatttgtcacttgc (product size = 253 bp); 2) β-actin-forward, tcaccatggatgatgatatcgcc, and β-actin-reverse, ccacacgcagctcattgtagaagg (product size = 282 bp); all primers were from Clough and Stefanis (32Clough R.L. Stefanis L. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Products were subsequently resolved on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide, and the signal intensity was quantified using Gel Analyzer version 1.0 software. Design of siRNAs and Cloning of Small Hairpin RNAs—A stem-loop structure incorporating the 21-nucleotide targeting rat Lamp2a sequence was created based on Rubinson et al. (33Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Zhang M. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), so that small hairpin RNA (shRNA) could be produced from the lentiviral vector PLL3.7 gift from Dr. Dimitrios Thanos (Laboratory for Molecular Biology, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens). Complementary oligonucleotides encoding the shRNAs were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into pLL3.7 vector by ligation into HpaI- and XhoI-digested vector (L1 vector). The pLL3.7 vector carries loxP sites, a cytomegalovirus promoter driving expression of EGFP, and the mouse U6 promoter with downstream restriction sites (HpaI and XhoI) to allow efficient introduction of oligonucleotides encoding shRNAs. Lentivirus Production—The lentiviruses were generated by co-transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with three plasmids using the calcium phosphate method (34Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We cultured HEK 293T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For transfection, 107 cells were plated into 150-cm2 flasks. The next day, the 293T cells were transfected with 50 μg of vector DNA (PLL3.7-L1, PLL3.7-scr), 17.5 μgof pMDG2 (env), and 32.5 μg of R8 91 (gag/pol) plasmids, using calcium-phosphate precipitation (all the plasmids for lentiviral vector packaging were kindly provided by Dr. Dimitrios Thanos). After 16 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and returned to the normal culture medium. Medium containing recombinant lentivectors was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection and centrifuged (400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove cellular debris. After filtration through 0.45-μm filter unit (Millipore), the supernatant from each time point was centrifuged at 75,000 × g or 90 min at 4 °C in Sorvall Discovery TH641 swing bucket rotor. The supernatant was discarded, and the virus (pellet) was resuspended in 50 μl/tube of PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. Lentiviral titers for the viruses collected each day were determined by seeding HeLa cells in 12-well plates at 5 × 104 cells per well, 3–4 h before infection with serial dilutions of the concentrated viral stock. After incubation for 2 days, the medium was removed, and the EGFP-expressing cells were identified using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Titers ranged from 3 to 6 × 107 infectious units (IU/m"
https://openalex.org/W2087575468,"Astrocytes have long been thought to act as a support network for neurons, with little role in information representation or processing. We used two-photon imaging of calcium signals in the ferret visual cortex in vivo to discover that astrocytes, like neurons, respond to visual stimuli, with distinct spatial receptive fields and sharp tuning to visual stimulus features including orientation and spatial frequency. The stimulus-feature preferences of astrocytes were exquisitely mapped across the cortical surface, in close register with neuronal maps. The spatially restricted stimulus-specific component of the intrinsic hemodynamic mapping signal was highly sensitive to astrocyte activation, indicating that astrocytes have a key role in coupling neuronal organization to mapping signals critical for noninvasive brain imaging. Furthermore, blocking astrocyte glutamate transporters influenced the magnitude and duration of adjacent visually driven neuronal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2059706603,"A central question in the study of cell proliferation is, what controls cell-cycle transitions? Although the accumulation of mitotic cyclins drives the transition from the G 2 phase to the M phase in embryonic cells, the trigger for mitotic entry in somatic cells remains unknown. We report that the synergistic action of Bora and the kinase Aurora A (Aur-A) controls the G 2 -M transition. Bora accumulates in the G 2 phase and promotes Aur-A–mediated activation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), leading to the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and mitotic entry. Mechanistically, Bora interacts with Plk1 and controls the accessibility of its activation loop for phosphorylation and activation by Aur-A. Thus, Bora and Aur-A control mitotic entry, which provides a mechanism for one of the most important yet ill-defined events in the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1998907224,"Thrombolytic treatment of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is markedly limited owing to concerns about hemorrhagic complications and the requirement that tPA be administered within 3 h of symptoms. Here we report that tPA activation of latent platelet-derived growth factor-CC (PDGF-CC) may explain these limitations. Intraventricular injection of tPA or active PDGF-CC, in the absence of ischemia, leads to significant increases in cerebrovascular permeability. In contrast, co-injection of neutralizing antibodies to PDGF-CC with tPA blocks this increased permeability, indicating that PDGF-CC is a downstream substrate of tPA within the neurovascular unit. These effects are mediated through activation of PDGF-alpha receptors (PDGFR-alpha) on perivascular astrocytes, and treatment of mice with the PDGFR-alpha antagonist imatinib after ischemic stroke reduces both cerebrovascular permeability and hemorrhagic complications associated with late administration of thrombolytic tPA. These data demonstrate that PDGF signaling regulates blood-brain barrier permeability and suggest potential new strategies for stroke treatment."

We found that the intracellular pathogens Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii use a type IV secretion system to deliver into eukaryotic cells a large number of different bacterial proteins containing ankyrin repeat homology domains called Anks. The L. pneumophila AnkX protein prevented microtubule-dependent vesicular transport to interfere with fusion of the L. pneumophila -containing vacuole with late endosomes after infection of macrophages, which demonstrates that Ank proteins have effector functions important for bacterial infection of eukaryotic host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2019647316,"Beuming and colleagues determined that the binding site for cocaine overlaps with that of dopamine on the dopamine transporter. Detailed modeling and mutagenesis experiments revealed that this site is deeply buried amongst several transmembrane domains. Cocaine is a widely abused substance with psychostimulant effects that are attributed to inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT). We present molecular models for DAT binding of cocaine and cocaine analogs constructed from the high-resolution structure of the bacterial transporter homolog LeuT. Our models suggest that the binding site for cocaine and cocaine analogs is deeply buried between transmembrane segments 1, 3, 6 and 8, and overlaps with the binding sites for the substrates dopamine and amphetamine, as well as for benztropine-like DAT inhibitors. We validated our models by detailed mutagenesis and by trapping the radiolabeled cocaine analog [3H]CFT in the transporter, either by cross-linking engineered cysteines or with an engineered Zn2+-binding site that was situated extracellularly to the predicted common binding pocket. Our data demonstrate the molecular basis for the competitive inhibition of dopamine transport by cocaine."

In Bacillus subtilis, we found that an operon required for biofilm matrix biosynthesis also encoded an inhibitor of motility, EpsE.

The clutch is a simple, rapid, and potentially reversible form of motility control."
https://openalex.org/W2016094469,"Efficient signal communication uses photons. Signal processing, however, uses an optically inactive medium, electrons. Therefore, an interconnection between electronic signal processing and optical communication is required at the integrated circuit level. We demonstrated control of exciton fluxes in an excitonic integrated circuit. The circuit consists of three exciton optoelectronic transistors and performs operations with exciton fluxes, such as directional switching and merging. Photons transform into excitons at the circuit input, and the excitons transform into photons at the circuit output. The exciton flux from the input to the output is controlled by a pattern of the electrode voltages. The direct coupling of photons, used in communication, to excitons, used as the device-operation medium, may lead to the development of efficient exciton-based optoelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2001405671,"Magmatic differentiation helps produce the chemical and petrographic diversity of terrestrial rocks. The extent to which magmatic differentiation fractionates nonradiogenic isotopes is uncertain for some elements. We report analyses of iron isotopes in basalts from Kilauea Iki lava lake, Hawaii. The iron isotopic compositions ( 56 Fe/ 54 Fe) of late-stagemeltveins are 0.2 permil (‰) greater than values for olivine cumulates. Olivine phenocrysts are up to 1.2‰ lighter than those of whole rocks. These results demonstrate that iron isotopes fractionate during magmatic differentiation at both whole-rock and crystal scales. This characteristic of iron relative to the characteristics of magnesium and lithium, for which no fractionation has been found, may be related to its complex redox chemistry in magmatic systems and makes iron a potential tool for studying planetary differentiation."

They formed as molten droplets and, judging from their abundances in chondrites, are the products of one of the most energetic processes that operated in the early inner solar system. The conditions and mechanism of chondrule formation remain poorly understood. Here we show that the abundance of the volatile element sodium remained relatively constant during chondrule formation. Prevention of the evaporation of sodium requires that chondrules formed in regions with much higher solid densities than predicted by known nebular concentration mechanisms. These regions would probably have been self-gravitating. Our model explains many other chemical characteristics of chondrules and also implies that chondrule and planetesimal formation were linked."

In traditional folk medicine, Xanthoxylum plants are referred to as 'toothache trees' because their anesthetic or counter-irritant properties render them useful in the treatment of pain. Psychophysical studies have identified hydroxy-α-sanshool as the compound most responsible for the unique tingling and buzzing sensations produced by Szechuan peppercorns or other Xanthoxylum preparations. Although it is generally agreed that sanshool elicits its effects by activating somatosensory neurons, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain a matter of debate. Here we show that hydroxy-α-sanshool excites two types of sensory neurons, including small-diameter unmyelinated cells that respond to capsaicin (but not mustard oil) as well as large-diameter myelinated neurons that express the neurotrophin receptor TrkC. We found that hydroxy-α-sanshool excites neurons through a unique mechanism involving inhibition of pH- and anesthetic-sensitive two-pore potassium channels (KCNK3, KCNK9 and KCNK18), providing a framework for understanding the unique and complex psychophysical sensations associated with the Szechuan pepper experience."

We demonstrated the natural vulnerability of the ice sheet by using pollen records from marine sediment off southwest Greenland that indicate important changes of the vegetation in Greenland over the past million years. The vegetation that developed over southern Greenland during the last interglacial period is consistent with model experiments, suggesting a reduced volume of the Greenland ice sheet. Abundant spruce pollen indicates that boreal coniferous forest developed some 400,000 years ago during the “warm” interval of marine isotope stage 11, providing a time frame for the development and decline of boreal ecosystems over a nearly ice-free Greenland."

We showed that the bacterial N -(3-oxo-dodecanoyl) homoserine lactone (C12) selectively impairs the regulation of NF-κB functions in activated mammalian cells. The consequence is specific repression of stimulus-mediated induction of NF-κB–responsive genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and other immune regulators. These findings uncover a strategy by which C12-producing opportunistic pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , attenuate the innate immune system to establish and maintain local persistent infection in humans, for example, in cystic fibrosis patients."

https://openalex.org/W2001805967,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) constitutes a highly pathogenic virus that infects lung epithelial cells to cause a wide spectrum of respiratory diseases. Our recent studies have revealed the existence of an interferon-alpha/beta-independent, innate antiviral response against RSV that was dependent on activation of NF-kappaB. We demonstrated that NF-kappaB inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) confers potent antiviral function against RSV in an NF-kappaB-dependent fashion, independent of interferon-alpha/beta. During our efforts to study this pathway, we identified HBD2 (human beta-defensin-2), a soluble secreted cationic protein as an antiviral factor induced during NF-kappaB-dependent innate antiviral activity in human lung epithelial cells. Our results demonstrated that HBD2 is induced by TNF and RSV in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Induction of HBD2 in infected cells was mediated by the paracrine/autocrine action of TNF produced upon RSV infection. HBD2 plays a critical role during host defense, because purified HBD2 drastically inhibited RSV infection. We also show that the antiviral mechanism of HBD2 involves blocking of viral cellular entry possibly because of destabilization/disintegration of the viral envelope. The important role of HBD2 in the innate response was also evident from loss of antiviral activity of TNF upon HBD2 silencing by short interfering RNA. The in vivo physiological relevance of HBD2 in host defense was apparent from induction of murine beta-defensin-4 (murine counterpart of HBD2) in lung tissues of RSV-infected mice. Thus, HBD2 functions as an antiviral molecule during NF-kappaB-dependent innate antiviral immunity mediated by the autocrine/paracrine action of TNF."

However, the mechanisms involved in osteoblast inhibition remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that increased Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1)-mediated degradation of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway signaling proteins mediates reduced bone formation in inflammatory disorders. Osteoblasts derived from bone marrow or long bone samples of adult tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice were used in this study. TNF decreased the steady-state levels of Smad1 and Runx2 protein similarly to those in long bones of TNF-Tg mice. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, TNF increased accumulation of ubiquitinated Smad1 protein. TNF administration over calvarial bones caused decreases in Smad1 and Runx2 protein levels and mRNA expression of osteoblast marker genes in wild-type, but not in Smurf1-/- mice. Vertebral bone volume and strength of TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice were examined by a combination of micro-CT, bone histomorphometry, and biomechanical testing and compared with those from TNF-Tg littermates. TNF-Tg mice had significantly decreased bone volume and biomechanical properties, which were partially rescued in TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice. We conclude that in chronic inflammatory disorders where TNF is increased, TNF induces the expression of ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 and promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Smad1 and Runx2, leading to systemic bone loss.

Small peptides that block Smurf1 from binding to Smads increase osteoblast functions (19Sangadala S. Boden S.D. Viggeswarapu M. Liu Y. Titus L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17212-17219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have used genetic approaches to demonstrate that both overexpression of Smurf1 in osteoblasts by type I collagen promoter or deletion of Smurf1 cause bone phenotypes. Smurf1 transgenic mice have decreased bone volume and reduced bone formation rates at 3–4-month of age (20Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, Smurf1-/- mice have an age-dependent increase in bone mass. Thus, Smurf1 appears to play important roles in regulating bone mass in adult mice under normal physiologic conditions. However, the role of Smurf1 in pathologic bone loss has not been studied. Recently, we observed a significant reduction in bone volume in long bones of TNF transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice with established arthritis and a decrease in mineralized bone nodule formation from cells derived from bone marrow of these mice compared with wild-type (WT) littermates (14Kaneki H. Guo R. Chen D. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Zhang Y.E. Boyce B.F. Xing L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4326-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Along with our previous finding that TNF increases Smurf1 expression in osteoblast cell lines (14Kaneki H. Guo R. Chen D. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Zhang Y.E. Boyce B.F. Xing L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4326-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that in TNF-Tg mice, Smurf1-mediated degradation of BMP signaling proteins is increased in osteoblasts, leading to reduced bone formation. Deletion of Smurf1 prevents bone loss in TNF-Tg mice. In the present studies, we demonstrated that Smurf1 protein expression is significantly increased in bones from TNF-Tg mice, which is associated with decreased Runx2 and Smad1 protein levels. The mice have reduced bone volumes and biomechanical parameters of bone strength. Smurf1 deletion prevents systemic bone loss and improves bone strength in TNF-Tg mice. Thus, our findings provide a novel molecular mechanism of TNF-induced inhibition in osteoblast function and BMP signaling, which involves post-transcriptional regulation of protein levels through Smurf1 E3 ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. Animals—We used 4–8-month-old animals in this study because alteration of bone volume occurs in adult genetic-modified Smurf1 mice and TNF-Tg mice (20Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). TNF-Tg mice (3647 TNF-Tg line) were originally obtained from Dr. G. Kollias and characterized by us (21Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TNF-Tg mice have elevated serum TNF levels when they reach 2 months of age or older (mean concentration is 100 pg/ml, range 48–120) (21Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which is compatible to published (22Di Comite G. Marinosci A. Di Matteo P. Manfredi A. Rovere-Querini P. Baldissera E. Aiello P. Corti A. Sabbadini M.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1069: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) serum TNF concentrations in RA patients (mean concentration was 71.2 pg/ml, range 10.7–556.5), making this model a close mimic of adult RA clinical presentations. They were crossed with C57/BL6 mice for 8 generations. Smurf1-/- mice are in a C57/BL6 background, as we described previously (23Yamashita M. Ying S.X. Zhang G.M. Li C. Cheng S.Y. Deng C.X. Zhang Y.E. Cell. 2005; 121: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice were generated by inter-crossing TNF-Tg and Smurf1+/- mice to generate the TNF-Tg/Smurf1+/- F1 generation; then these F1 mice were crossed with Smurf1+/- mice to generate TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all studies. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies specific for c-Myc and β-Actin were purchased from Sigma; anti-Runx2 monoclonal antibody was from MBL (Woburn, MA); anti-Smad1/5 and anti-Ubiquitin monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-pSmad1/5 polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); and anti-Smurf1 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection Conditions—2T3 osteoblast precursors were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). When cells reached 90% confluence, the cDNA expression plasmid, pCMV-Myc-tagged Smad1 (M-Smad1), and/or a pCMV-FLAG-tagged Smurf1 (F-Smurf1) were transiently transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total amounts of transfected plasmids in each group were equalized by the addition of an empty vector. After transfection, the cells were further cultured in the presence and absence of TNF + the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and subjected to Western blot analysis. Primary Bone Marrow Osteoblast Cultures—To generate bone marrow-derived osteoblasts from mice, bone marrow cells were flushed from femoral and tibial bones and cultured in α-medium plus 20% fetal bovine serum for 7 days to generate mesenchymal stromal cells. The cells were then cultured in osteoblast inducing medium (α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) and treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or TNF (7.5 ng/ml) for various times. For human bone marrow osteoblast cultures, human mesenchymal stromal cells were isolated, as we described previously (24Ito H. Goater J.J. Tiyapatanaputi P. Rubery P.T. O'Keefe R.J. Schwarz E.M. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow aspirates were obtained from the iliac crests of patients during spinal surgery after informed consent under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Rochester Medical Center. These were mixed with equal volumes of PBS. One volume of lymphocyte separation medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) was then slowly layered underneath the aspirate/PBS mixture to isolate mononuclear cells. The mononuclear cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and adherent cells were incubated for further expansion. Second to third passages of these human mesenchymal stromal cells were used in subsequent experiments. Cells were cultured in osteoblast inducing medium in the presence or absence of TNF, as described above. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures or bone samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Bone samples were cut into small pieces and homogenized in TRIzol reagent. Expression levels of Smurf1, Smurf2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, RANKL, osteoprotegrin, and β-actin mRNA were examined using quantitative real-time PCR amplification and sequence-specific primers, as described previously (14Kaneki H.

Kaji Y. Oshika T. Ishii Y. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Long bone samples were cut into small pieces and homogenized in tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce). Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with individual antibodies. Membranes were then washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and visualized by an enhanced chemiluminesence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ubiquitination Assay—2T3 cells were transfected with M-Smad1 and treated with TNF for 72 h + MG132 for the last 4 h of TNF treatment. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc antibody and protein G-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. In some experiments, calvarial pre-osteoblasts were isolated from 3–5-day-old pups from Smurf1-/- and WT mice, as published previously (26Franzoso G. Carlson L. Xing L. Poljak L. Shores E.W. Brown K.D. Leonardi A. Tran T. Boyce B.F. Siebenlist U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with TNF for 72 h plus MG132 for the last 4 h. Total Smad1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, resuspended in 2× reducing sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-ubiquitin antibody, as described previously (14Kaneki H.

Microcomputed Tomography (Micro-CT)—The fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) was used for micro-CT and mechanical testing because our preliminary study demonstrated that L4 gave the smallest inter-sample variation in mechanical testing perhaps due to its large size and ease of dissection compared with L5–7. L4 vertebrae were scanned at high resolution (10.5 μm) on a VivaCT40 micro-CT scanner (Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) using an integration time of 300 ms, energy of 55 kVp, and intensity of 145 μA. A volume of interest for quantitative analysis of trabecular bone was defined, extending from the proximal to the distal end of the vertebrae. The three-dimensional images were generated using a constant threshold of 275 for all samples. For each sample, bone volume fraction, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, and connectivity density were measured. Mechanical Testing—The L4 vertebra was used and mechanical testing was performed according to a published method with a minor modification (28Silva M.J. Brodt M.D. Uthgenannt B.A. Bone. 2004; 35: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, the L4 was dissected of soft tissue and the vertebral body was isolated from the posterior elements by cutting the pedicles with a 10-mm diameter diamond saw. The end plates of the vertebral body were cemented onto small plastic plates using bone cement (DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., Warsaw, IN), to ensure axial alignment of the bodies and to distribute the load evenly on the surface of the cemented end plates. The specimens were then hydrated in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The vertebral bodies were tested in compression at a rate of 1 mm/min until failure using an Instron DynaMight 8841 servo-hydraulic materials testing machine (Instron, Norwood, MA). Maximum compressive load at failure (N), maximum deformation at maximum force (mm), stiffness (N/mm), and energy to failure (area under the curve) (N.mm) were measured from the recorded load-deformation curves using MATLAB software (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). Histology—Paraffin sections were stained with H&E or for TRAP activity. Histomorphometric analyses were performed using an OsteoMeasure program (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA) (21Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Looney R.J. Ritchlin C.T. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Peri-articular inflammation (mm2) and eroded articular surface (%) were measured around knee joints and the number of osteoclast per millimeter bone surface was countered in the proximal tibiae region. Statistics Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D., and all experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Statistical analyses were performed with StatView statistical software (SAS, Cary, NC). Differences between the two groups were compared using un-paired Student's t test and more than two groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance, followed by a Bonferroni/Dunnet test. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Chronic TNF Treatment of Mouse and Human Bone Marrow-derived Osteoblasts Increases Smurf1 and Reduces Basal Smad1 and Runx2 Protein Expression—Systemic osteoporosis occurs often in patients suffering from chronic inflammatory disorders and in TNF-Tg mice that have been chronically exposed to elevated blood TNF levels and have developed RA-like arthritis (14Kaneki H. Guo R. Chen D. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Zhang Y.E. Boyce B.F. Xing L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4326-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that treatment of 2T3 pre-osteoblasts with TNF for 3 days increases Smurf1 expression and proteasomal degradation of Runx2 (14Kaneki H. Guo R. Chen D. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Zhang Y.E. Boyce B.F. Xing L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4326-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), leading to a hypothesis that elevated Smurf1-mediated BMP-signaling protein degradation may contribute to reduced osteoblast function in TNF-Tg mice. To test this hypothesis, we first attempted to establish a culture protocol that mimics the in vivo situation of TNF-Tg mice. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells from 4–8-month-old WT mice were cultured in the osteoblast inducing medium and treated with TNF for 20 days. The expression levels of osteoblast marker genes were examined. TNF decreased the expression of ALP and osteocalcin starting from day 8, which became more significant thereafter, whereas ALP and osteocalcin expression increased markedly in PBS-treated cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, TNF-induced decreased ALP expression occurs usually much earlier in calvaria-derived or 2T3 pre-osteoblast cells (at about 24 h after TNF treatment, data not shown). These findings suggest that primary bone marrow-derived osteoblasts may respond to TNF differently and we decided to use 14-day TNF treatment as a protocol in our subsequent study. Under this culture condition, TNF decreased phosphorylated and total Smad1/5 as well as Runx2 protein levels and increased Smurf1 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether this inhibitory effect of TNF on Smad1/5 and Runx2 protein expression also happened in vivo, we examined long bones of 4–5-month-old TNF-Tg mice, which had developed severe inflammatory arthritis and systemic bone loss. We found that Smurf1 protein expression was increased and phospho-Smad1/5, total Smad1/5, and Runx2 protein levels as well as ALP mRNA expression levels were decreased in bones from TNF-Tg mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2, C and D). To determine whether these inhibitory effects of TNF also occur in human osteoblasts, we treated osteoblasts derived from human bone marrow stromal cells with TNF. TNF increased Smurf1, decreased ALP, and had no effect on Smurf2 mRNA expression in human cells (Fig. 2E). The expression of phospho-Smad1/5, total Smad1/5, and Runx2 protein levels was significantly decreased in TNF-treated cells (Fig. 2F). TNF Promotes Proteasomal Degradation of Smad1 through Smurf1-mediated Ubiquitination—We have demonstrated previously that Smurf1 mediates TNF-induced reduction in Runx2 protein levels in the 2T3 preosteoblast cell line (14Kaneki H. Guo R. Chen D. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Zhang Y.E. Boyce B.F. Xing L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4326-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNF also affects Smad1 protein degradation through Smurf1, we transiently co-transfected 2T3 cells with M-Smad1 and F-Smurf1 expression vectors and treated them with TNF. TNF decreased exogenous Smad1 protein expression, assessed using an anti-c-Myc antibody, to a degree similar to that seen in cells overexpressing Smurf1 (Fig. 3A). To test if this was mediated by promoting ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Smad1, we treated cells with TNF + the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Smad1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc antibody and expression was assessed by Western blot using an anti-Ubiquitin antibody. In the presence of MG132, TNF increased the accumulation of ubiquitinated-Smad1 protein (Fig. 3B), indicating that TNF induces Smad1 ubiquitination and results in its rapid breakdown through proteasomal degradation. TNF-decreased Smad1 Protein Levels Are Attenuated in Smurf1-/- Mice—If Smurf1 mediates TNF-induced inhibition of osteoblast function, the effect should be attenuated or abolished in the absence of Smurf1. To examine this possibility, we generated TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice and examined their bones when they were 7–8 months old. ALP and osteocalcin mRNA and Smads and Runx2 protein levels were examined. ALP and osteocalcin mRNA expression and Smad1/5 and Runx2 protein levels were decreased in TNF-Tg mice and these were restored to the WT levels in TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice (Fig. 4, A and B). To confirm that TNF-induced decrease Smad1 protein levels is through Smurf1-mediated Smad1 ubiquitination in vivo, we treated calvarial pre-osteoblasts from Smurf1-/- and WT mice with TNF and subjected them to a ubiquitination assay. As shown in the 2T3 preosteoblast cell line, TNF increased the ubiquitination of endogenous Smad1 protein, which was prevented in cells from Smurf1-/- mice (Fig. 4C). Smurf1 Deletion Attenuates Reduction in Bone Volume and Strength in TNF-Tg Mice—To determine whether Smurf1 deletion prevents the systemic bone loss in TNF-Tg mice, we analyzed vertebral bones of TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice and compared them with WT, Smurf1-/-, and TNF-Tg mice from the same litters using micro-CT, histology, and mechanical testing. We used vertebral bones in these studies because persistent severe inflammation in the knee and ankle joints of TNF-Tg mice cause deformation and destruction of joints and, in some cases, damage to the epiphyses of femora and tibiae due to massive bone remodeling. This prohibited us from reliably examining the role of Smurf1 deletion in bone loss of the long bones of these mice. Micro-CT analyses of cancellous regions of the vertebrae (Fig. 5, A and B) show that the bone volume of Smurf1-/- mice was significantly increased as previously reported in long bones of these mice (23Yamashita M. Ying S.X. Zhang G.M. Li C. Cheng S.Y. Deng C.X. Zhang Y.E. Cell. 2005; 121: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). TNF-Tg mice had a statistically significant decrease in bone volume, particularly in the middle portions of the vertebral bodies (see box in the Fig. 5A). Bone volume was restored to WT levels in TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice (Fig. 5B). In contrast, micro-CT analysis of cortical regions in the same vertebrae found that both TNF-Tg and TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice had significantly reduced cortical bone thickness compared with WT or Smurf1-/- mice (cortical thickness (mm): 0.236 ± 0.020 in WT, 0.211 ± 0.026 in Smurf1-/-, *0.190 + 0.016 in TNF-Tg, and *0.186 ± 0.012 in TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice; *, p < 0.05 versus WT mice). The micro-CT findings were confirmed histologically (supplemental Fig. S2). Osteoporosis is typically associated with reduced bone strength. To examine if TNF-Tg mice have reduced bone quality and if this can be rescued by Smurf1 deletion, we examined the compressive biomechanical properties of mouse vertebral bones using a modified Instron material testing system (28Silva M.J. Brodt M.D. Uthgenannt B.A. Bone. 2004; 35: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The biomechanical properties measured include maximum deformation, maximum compressive load at failure, energy to failure, and stiffness. Compared with WT littermates, TNF-Tg mice have significantly reduced biomechanical properties except stiffness (Fig. 6, A and B). TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice have improved mechanical strength in certain degrees. The maximum compressive load in TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice was higher than in TNF-Tg mice and restored to the WT levels. Their energy to failure was improved compared with TNF-Tg mice but still lower than in WT mice (Fig. 6B). The maximum deformation was unchanged between TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- and TNF-Tg mice, both of which were significantly lower than WT mice (Fig. 6B). In addition, there were no differences in Smurf1-/- and WT mice vertebral biomechanical properties except stiffness. TNF is known to stimulate osteoclast formation and bone erosion in joints of RA patients and animals (29Goldring S.R. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2003; 42: ii11-ii16PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether partially restored bone mass in TNF-Tg/Smurf1-/- mice is due to potent influence of Smurf1 on osteoclast function, we examined osteoclast number and local bone erosion in knee jo"

We thus combined extensive biochemical and pharmacological approaches to a nanoscale strategy based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to assess the spatial and functional influence of cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered lipid nanodomains on β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) signaling. The data revealed that whereas β2AR did not partition within liquid-ordered lipid phase, a pool of G protein and adenylyl cyclase (AC) were sequestered in these domains. Destabilization of the liquid-ordered phase by cholesterol depletion led to a lateral redistribution of Gαs and AC that favored interactions between the receptor and its signaling partners as assessed by BRET. This resulted in an increased basal and agonist-promoted β2AR-stimulated cAMP production that was partially dampened as a result of constitutive protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of the receptor. This restraining influence of nanodomains on β2AR signaling was further substantiated by showing that liquid-ordered lipid phase stabilization using caveolin overexpression or increasing membrane cholesterol amount led to an inhibition of β2AR-associated signaling. Given the emerging concept that clustering of receptors and effectors into signaling platforms contributes to the efficacy and selectivity of signal transduction, our results support a model whereby cholesterol-promoted liquid-ordered lipid phase-embedding Gs and AC allows their lateral separation from the receptor, thus restraining the basal activity and controlling responsiveness of β2AR signaling machinery within larger signaling platforms.

The determination of the exact role of lateral membrane heterogeneities in signal transduction, however, remains poorly understood. In the last decade, lateral membrane organization, which is governed by an intricate lipid-protein association, has been the subject of intense scrutiny that eventually led to the hypothesis of raft domains (15Harder T.

Lipid rafts have been characterized as dynamic nanometer scale membrane domains of a size most likely less than 10 nm (16Sharma P. Varma R. Sarasij R.C. Ira Gousset K. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao M. Mayor S. Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 17Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Their formation is driven by the tight packing of cholesterol with long and saturated acyl chain lipids that leads to the formation of a liquid-ordered phase segregating the embedded proteins away from the rest of the membrane (15Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 18Mayor S. Rao M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Brown D.A.

Flotation on sucrose gradient and resistance to solubilization by non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 has been commonly used to characterized raft protein and lipid content. Their capacity to be organized in higher order lateral domains, such as caveolae, gave rise to a sophisticated working model of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of actively maintained lateral domains (18Mayor S.

Academic Press, Orlando, FL1990: 295-315Crossref Google Scholar). Several groups have shown that the β2AR is most likely present at the plasma membrane in large protein complexes containing most of the molecular actors necessary for both receptor activity and regulation (22Rybin V.O.

Interestingly, a near field optical microscopy study revealed β2AR clusters of ∼140 nm in diameter, which may represent the structural basis of these signaling complexes (6Ianoul A. Grant D.D.

The link between such signaling platforms, also called a signalosome, and the lipid-mediated lateral segregation of the signaling molecules remains however poorly understood. adrenergic receptor adenylyl cyclase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer caveolin 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin cholera toxin cyanopindolol detergent-resistant membrane γ-aminobutyric acid receptor green fluorescent protein monosialotetrahexosylganglioside guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate hemagglutinin human embryonic kidney 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline protein kinase A Renilla luciferase yellow fluorescent protein wild type. adrenergic receptor adenylyl cyclase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer caveolin 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin cholera toxin cyanopindolol detergent-resistant membrane γ-aminobutyric acid receptor green fluorescent protein monosialotetrahexosylganglioside guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate hemagglutinin human embryonic kidney 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline protein kinase A Renilla luciferase yellow fluorescent protein wild type. Experimental observations made during the last 15 years led researchers to propose that cholesterol-enriched membrane lipid microdomains, and more specifically caveolae, may influence β2AR signal transduction properties by controlling its association with its signaling partners (22Rybin V.O.

However, such a model whereby β2AR signaling machinery confinement inside cholesterol-enriched caveolae promotes signal transduction is difficult to reconcile with the negative role that cholesterol seems to play on β2AR-associated effectors as well as with the rather low percentage of β2AR signalosomes actually localized in caveolae (6Ianoul A. Grant D.D. Rouleau Y. Bani-Yaghoub M. Johnston L.J. Pezacki J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Indeed, cholesterol depletion is generally found to increase β2AR-stimulated cAMP production (22Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 25Miura Y. Hanada K. Jones T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15418-15423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas cholesterol supplementation has the inverse effect (26Scarpace P.J. O'Connor S.W. Abrass I.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Considering the evolution of our understanding of the membrane lateral organization and the inherent multiple nature of membrane domains, one could argue that the role of cholesterol-enriched domains in the regulation of β2AR signaling efficacy may have been difficult to clarify in part because of the different resolution power of the various techniques used for studying signal transduction and to characterized lipid-rafts. To test this possibility, we performed a detailed analysis of the impact of cholesterol on the lateral membrane distribution of the β2AR signaling components as well as their coupling efficacy. For this purpose, we combined pharmacological, biochemical, and biophysical characterizations of the membrane environment of the β2AR and its effectors, Gαs and AC V/VI and of its functional consequences. Constructs—FLAG-β2ARWT cloned into pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Stefano Marullo (Cochin Institute, Paris). HA-β2ARWT was described previously (29Lavoie C. Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Umapathy D.

Plasmid encoding the HA-caveolin-3 (Cav-3) and AC V-YFP constructs were kind gifts from Dr. R. G. Parton (University of Queensland Medical School, Australia) and Dr. Zvi Voegel (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel), respectively. pGFP2-Gαs vector was described previously (32Gales C. Rebois R.V. Hogue M. Trieu P. Breit A. Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293S cells (HEK293) stably expressing FLAG-β2ARWT, HA-β2ARWT, or β2ARPKA- were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 250 μg/ml Geneticin (all from Wisent, St. Bruno, CA). When needed, transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) following the supplier's recommendation. Twenty-four hours after transfection, supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was renewed, and cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Cholesterol Depletion and Complementation—For cholesterol depletion experiments, HEK293 cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (w/v) (CD) or cholesterol oxidase (1 unit/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following depletion treatment, membrane cholesterol concentration was restored by incubating cells with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes for 1 h at 37 °C (33Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Membrane cholesterol content was measured using an Amplex Red™ cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes) following the supplier's recommendation. Membrane Preparation—Cells were rinsed once with PBS, lysed in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA along with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine), and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax; Janke and Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) for 15 s. Homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were then washed twice in the same buffer and centrifuged again. The resulting membrane pellets were finally resuspended in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA and the protease inhibitor mixture. Membranes were immediately used for adenylyl cyclase activity and/or radioligand binding assays. Protein content in the membrane preparation was evaluated using the Bradford protein assay (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad). Radioligand Binding Assay—Radioligand binding assays were performed as described previously (35Chidiac P. Nouet S. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 662-669PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were incubated in a total volume of 0.5 ml in a buffer containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, and varying concentrations of β2AR ligands depending on the type of experiment. For competition experiments, [I125]cyanopindolol (CYP) was used at a concentration of 25 pm and competed by increasing concentrations of isoproterenol, whereas for saturation experiments increasing concentrations of [I125]CYP (2–400 pm) were used. Binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 90 min and terminated by rapid filtration through glass fiber (GF/C) filters (Whatman) using ice-cold 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. In some experiments, the binding reaction was carried out in the presence or absence of 250 μm Gpp(NH)p. Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—Adenylyl cyclase activity was assessed according to the Salomon method (36Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were incubated in the absence or presence of various concentrations of isoproterenol, forskolin, Gpp(NH)p, or MnCl2 along with 0.1 mm cAMP, 53 μm GTP, 2.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 unit of myokinase, 0.2 unit of pyruvate kinase, and 0.12 mm ATP (106 cpm of [α-32P]ATP/assay) (NEN-Mandel) in a total volume of 50 μl. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of a cold stop solution containing 0.4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm cAMP, and [3H]cAMP (50,000 cpm). cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography using a Dowex gel column followed by filtration on an aluminum oxide column. Biochemical Preparation of Light Density Membrane Microdomains—Detergent-free purification of cholesterol-enriched microdomains was carried out according to the protocol described by Song et al. (37Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Briefly, after two washes in cold PBS, cells were scraped into 1 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, and homogenized sequentially using a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts at 24,000 min-1), and a sonicator (three 20-s bursts, Branson Sonifier 250; Branson Ultrasonics). The homogenate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 1 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl), placed at the bottom of an Ultra-Clear centrifuge tube (Beckman Instruments), and overlaid with a 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient (6.5 ml of 35% sucrose/3.5 ml of 5% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate). An alternative detergent-free method of microdomain preparation developed by MacDonald and Pike (38MacDonald J.L. Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was also used to compare the two methods. Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) were obtained by sucrose flotation after solubilization of either whole cells or membrane preparation as indicated in the legends for Figs. 5, 8, and 9. Briefly, cells or membranes where solubilized in ice-cold TKM buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing 1 or 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) (Sigma). The resulting preparations were loaded on a sucrose step gradient as described above, except that sucrose solutions were prepared in TKM instead of MBS buffer.FIGURE 8Effect of cholesterol depletion on AC V/VI and Gαs submembrane distribution and on their respective association with β2AR. A, cells stably expressing 1 pmol/mg β2AR were subjected or not (Control) to cholesterol depletion using 2% CD for 1 h at 37 ° C, and to cholesterol reloading using CD-cholesterol complex (Complementation). Following these treatments, membranes were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and fractionated on a sucrose gradient. An equal volume of fractions from each sucrose gradient was analyzed for the presence of β2AR, Gαs, AC V/VI, and GM1 by Western blot using the appropriate antibodies. B, cells transiently expressing β2AR-RLuc and either GFP2-Gαs or AC V-YFP were cholesterol-depleted and reloaded as described in A. Immediately following treatment, cells were washed in PBS and treated or not (Vehicle) for 1 min with isoproterenol (Iso), and BRET was measured after addition of substrate.

Cells stably expressingβ2AR were transiently transfected with caveolin-3 or the empty vector (pcDNA3). A, the impact of Cav-3 on the membrane distribution of β2AR/Gαs/AC V/VI was determined by performing a Triton X-100-based preparation of light density microdomains. B, the effect of Cav-3 overexpression on the binding properties of β2AR was assessed by competing [I125]CYP binding with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol. C and D, cAMP production in the presence of increasing amount of isoproterenol (C) or a single maximal dose of MnCl2 (D; 100 mm) was measured. All of these pharmacological data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate in the case of binding experiments and in duplicate in the case of the AC assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gradients prepared with the different methods were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16–20 h in an SW 41 rotor (Beckman L70 Ultracentrifuge). Eleven 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradients. The protein content of each fraction was measured using a Nano-Orange™ protein quantification kit (Molecular Probes). Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Equal volumes of each gradient fraction (except for fractions 1–2 and 6–7, which were pooled together) were resolved on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon) (except for CD46, which was detected from a separated gel run under nonreducing condition). For immunodetection, the following antibodies were used: anti-CD46 (clone J4-48) was from Immunotech; anti-β2AR (clone H-20), anti-AC V/VI (Clone C-17), and anti-Cav-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-flotillin-1 and anti-clathrin heavy chain were from Transduction Laboratories; anti-transferrin receptor was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Anti-Gαs antibody was a gift from Dr. Jean-Luc Guillaume (Institut Cochin, Paris), and anti-β2AR phosphoserine-specific antibody (2G3) (39Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was a gift from Richard B. Clark (University of Texas, Houston). Immobilized antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the appropriate species-specific affinity-purified secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and developed using Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GM1 gangliosides were detected by dot-blot using peroxidase-coupled cholera toxin subunit B (CTx; Sigma). GM1 Aggregation and Confocal Microscopy—To induce GM1 aggregation, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated CTx (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) was first applied to the cells for 30 min at 4 °C (40Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) and then washed in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer). A goat anti-CTx antibody (Calbiochem) was then applied for 30 min at 4 °C, and cells were finally incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After three washes in cold PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100, and labeled with the appropriate primary antibody (either anti-HA (clone 12G5), anti-Cav-3, or anti-CD46). Following extensive washing, cells were incubated with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) to reveal these antigens. Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol (Hoechst). Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis was performed on a Leica TCS SP1 confocal microscope, and co-localization was performed by overlaying the images using Leica confocal software (LCS; Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Excitation and emission filters for the different labeled dyes were as follows: YFP (green): λex = 488 nm, λem = 540/25 nm; Texas Red (red): λex = 568 nm, λem = 610/30 nm. BRET Assay—The propensity of the signaling molecules to distribute into liquid-ordered microdomains was determined using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Cells were transiently transfected for 48 h with β2AR C-terminally fused to the Renilla luciferase (β2AR-Rluc), γ-aminobutyric acid receptor 1 (GBR1) C-terminally fused to RLuc in the presence of GBR2 to favor GBR1 plasma membrane expression (41White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), or an RLuc fusion of one of the component of the heterotrimeric G protein (Gγ2 (Gγ2-Rluc) in the presence of its partners, Gαs and Gβ1, as described previously (32Gales C. Rebois R.V. Hogue M. Trieu P. Breit A. Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar)). On the day of the experiment, living cells expressing similar amount of RLuc were fluorescently labeled with increasing concentrations of DiIC16 or FastDiI (Molecular Probes) at 4 °C for 5 min as described previously (42Jiao X. Zhang N. Xu X. Oppenheim J.J. Jin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in order to mark liquid-ordered or disordered membrane regions, respectively. BRET measurements were monitored in PBS following the addition of Coelenterazine h (5 μm, NanoLight Technology) using a multi-well plate reader, Mithras LB 940 (Berthold), which allowed the sequential integration of signals detected in the 480 ± 20 and 530 ± 20 nm windows for donor (Rluc-fused proteins) and acceptor (DiIC16 or FastDiI) light emission, respectively. BRET signal was determined by calculating the ratio of the light intensity emitted by the acceptor over the light intensity emitted by the donor. Values were corrected by subtracting the background BRET signal detected when th"
https://openalex.org/W1996022168,"Antibody diversity occurs randomly as B cells recombine their immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy- and light-chain genes during development. This process inevitably generates reactivity against self structures, and several mechanisms prevent the development of autoreactive B cells. We report here a role for the pre-B cell receptor, composed of Ig heavy and surrogate light chains, in the negative selection of cells expressing Ig heavy chains with the potential to generate autoantibodies. Surrogate light-chain-deficient (SLC-/-) mice harbored elevated levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in their serum and showed evidence of escape of pre-B cells expressing prototypic autoantibody heavy chains from negative selection, leading to mature autoantibody secreting CD21-CD23- B cells in the periphery. Thus, the pre-B cell receptor appears to censor the development of certain autoantibody-secreting cells and may represent an important factor in multifactorial autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2095454953,"Substrates of a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system called the N-end rule pathway include proteins with destabilizing N-terminal residues. N-recognins, the pathway's ubiquitin ligases, contain three substrate-binding sites. The type-1 site is specific for basic N-terminal residues (Arg, Lys, and His). The type-2 site is specific for bulky hydrophobic N-terminal residues (Trp, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Ile). We show here that the type-1/2 sites of UBR1, the sole N-recognin of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are located in the first approximately 700 residues of the 1,950-residue UBR1. These sites are distinct in that they can be selectively inactivated by mutations, identified through a genetic screen. Mutations inactivating the type-1 site are in the previously delineated approximately 70-residue UBR motif characteristic of N-recognins. Fluorescence polarization and surface plasmon resonance were used to determine that UBR1 binds, with a K(d) of approximately 1 microm, to either type-1 or type-2 destabilizing N-terminal residues of reporter peptides but does not bind to a stabilizing N-terminal residue such as Gly. A third substrate-binding site of UBR1 targets an internal degron of CUP9, a transcriptional repressor of peptide import. We show that the previously demonstrated in vivo dependence of CUP9 ubiquitylation on the binding of cognate dipeptides to the type-1/2 sites of UBR1 can be reconstituted in a completely defined in vitro system. We also found that purified UBR1 and CUP9 interact nonspecifically and that specific binding (which involves, in particular, the binding by cognate dipeptides to the UBR1 type-1/2 sites) can be restored either by a chaperone such as EF1A or through macromolecular crowding."
https://openalex.org/W2001957020,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I regulates a mutually exclusive interaction of PP2A and β1 integrin with the WD repeat scaffolding protein RACK1. This interaction is required for the integration of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and adhesion signaling. Here we investigated the nature of the binding site for PP2A and β1 integrin in RACK1. A WD7 deletion mutant of RACK1 did not associate with PP2A but retained some interaction with β1 integrin, whereas a WD6/WD7 mutant lost the ability to bind to both PP2A and β1 integrin. Using immobilized peptide arrays representing the entire RACK1 protein, we identified a common cluster of amino acids (FAGY) at positions 299–302 within WD7 of RACK1 which were essential for binding of both PP2A and β1 integrin to RACK1. PP2A showed a higher level of association with a peptide in which Tyr-302 was phosphorylated compared with an unphosphorylated peptide, whereas β1 integrin binding was not affected by phosphorylation. RACK1 mutants in which either the FAGY cluster or Tyr-302 were mutated to AAAF, or Phe, respectively, did not interact with either PP2A or β1 integrin. These mutants were unable to rescue the decrease in PP2A activity caused by suppression of RACK1 in MCF-7 cells with small interfering RNA. MCF-7 cells and R+ (IGF-IR-overexpressing fibroblasts) expressing these mutants exhibited decreased proliferation and migration, whereas R– cells (IGF-IR null fibroblasts) were unaffected. Taken together, the data demonstrate that Tyr-302 in RACK1 is required for interaction with PP2A and β1 integrin, for regulation of PP2A activity, and for IGF-I-mediated cell migration and proliferation. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I regulates a mutually exclusive interaction of PP2A and β1 integrin with the WD repeat scaffolding protein RACK1.

RACK1 mutants in which either the FAGY cluster or Tyr-302 were mutated to AAAF, or Phe, respectively, did not interact with either PP2A or β1 integrin. These mutants were unable to rescue the decrease in PP2A activity caused by suppression of RACK1 in MCF-7 cells with small interfering RNA. MCF-7 cells and R+ (IGF-IR-overexpressing fibroblasts) expressing these mutants exhibited decreased proliferation and migration, whereas R– cells (IGF-IR null fibroblasts) were unaffected. Taken together, the data demonstrate that Tyr-302 in RACK1 is required for interaction with PP2A and β1 integrin, for regulation of PP2A activity, and for IGF-I-mediated cell migration and proliferation. RACK1 is a highly conserved scaffolding protein with seven WD repeats that functions as a seven-sided propeller protein and displays significant homology to the β subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (1McCahill A.

Neurobiol. 2006; 78: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although RACK1 was originally named for its function in targeting activated C kinases around the cell, it has also been shown to act as a broadly active scaffolding protein in diverse essential cellular functions, including transcription and translation (1McCahill A.

RACK1 scaffolds β1 integrin to a complex at the IGF-IR and promotes recruitment and dissociation of several proteins to this complex in response to IGF-I (9Kiely P.A. Leahy M. O'Gorman D. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7624-7633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These proteins are required for IGF-IR signaling and include IRS-1 and -2, Src, PP2A, Shp-2, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (9Kiely P.A. Leahy M. O'Gorman D. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7624-7633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although RACK1 associates with multiple signaling proteins (1McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), it is not known which proteins or how many proteins interact with RACK1 at any given time to promote integrin or IGF-I signaling. The different kinetics of recruitment and release of these proteins from RACK1 in response to IGF-I stimulation suggests that IGF-I-mediated competitive interaction of signaling proteins with RACK1 may be an important mechanism of its scaffolding function in IGF-I receptor and integrin signaling. We recently demonstrated that IGF-I-mediated cell migration requires a mutually exclusive association of RACK1 with the serine threonine phosphatase PP2A and β1 integrin (14Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PP2A is associated with RACK1 when cells are cultured without serum, but PP2A becomes rapidly released upon IGF-I stimulation at the same time as β1 integrin becomes recruited to the complex. Ligation of integrins is necessary for release of PP2A. The binding site for both of these proteins resides in the C terminus of RACK1 between WD repeats 4 and 7. These observations suggest that β1 integrin competes with and displaces PP2A from binding to RACK1 in response to IGF-I stimulation and that this competition is a necessary component for the integration of IGF-IR and adhesion signaling during the proliferation and migration of tumor cells. PP2A has a well established role in regulating the MAPK pathway (15Rodriguez-Viciana P. Collins C. Fried M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19290-19295Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Zhao W.Q. Feng C. Alkon D.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 14: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Sieburth D.S.

Signal. 1999; 11: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and can negatively regulate growth factor signaling by preventing Shc phosphorylation in response to epidermal growth factor and IGF (19Ugi S. Imamura T. Maegawa H. Egawa K. Yoshizaki T. Shi K. Obata T. Ebina Y. Kashiwagi A. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8778-8789Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 20Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, IGF-I stimulation transiently suppresses total cellular PP2A activity, and overexpression of RACK1 increases PP2A activity. However, whether RACK1 can directly regulate PP2A activity or act to target PP2A to specific locations in the cell remains unknown. To determine if competition between PP2A and β1 integrin for binding to RACK1 is essential for IGF-I signaling, here we aimed to identify the nature of the binding site for PP2A and β1 integrin in RACK1 and to assess if this binding site is essential for the function of RACK1 in the IGF-IR context. We found that both PP2A and β1 integrin bind to a cluster of amino acids within WD7 of RACK1 that encompasses a tyrosine at position 302. Mutation of Tyr-302 was sufficient to disrupt the binding of both PP2A and β1 integrin to RACK1 and was sufficient to abrogate the effects of RACK1 overexpression on increasing IGF-I-mediated cell proliferation, migration, and suppression of PP2A activity. These findings provide a mechanism for IGF-I-mediated regulation of RACK1 function in the integration of IGF-IR and adhesion signaling and suggest that the competitive interaction of proteins with RACK1 may be a general feature of its scaffolding role in signal propagation. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant IGF-I was purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Anti-RACK1 and anti-PP2A monoclonal antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany). Anti-IGF-IR polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-actin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma Ireland Ltd., (Dublin, Ireland). Recombinant PP2A was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-integrin β-1 integrin was purchased from Chemicon (catalog number AB1952), and purified human integrin was purchased from Chemicon (catalog number CC1012). Cell Culture, Transfection, and IGF-I-mediated Stimulation of MCF-7 Cells—The MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line and R+ and R– cell lines (mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from IGF-IR knock-out mice) (21Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker, Verviers, Belgium), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mm l-Glu, and 5 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Where indicated, MCF-7 cells, R+ cells, and R– cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3HA/RACK1 WT, RACK1 FAGY-AAAF, RACK1 Y302F, or empty pcDNA3 vectors (8 μg of DNA) using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h in culture, the transfected cells were seeded into 24-well plates for monitoring cell proliferation. For analysis of PP2A activity, the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and starved from serum for 4 h before being stimulated with IGF-I for the indicated times. RNA Interference—The siRNAs targeted to the untranslated region of RACK1 were purchased from Dharmacon. The sequences were as follows: siRNA utr1 sense, 5′-AGGAGAGGUUGUGGUGCUAGUUUUU; siRNA utr2 sense, 5′-AGAAACUAGCACCACAACCUCUCUU; siRNA utr3 sense, 5′-GAGAGGUUGUGGUGCUAGUUUCUUU. MCF-7 cells were seeded at 50% confluence and were transfected with the indicated siRNA concentration using the Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (14Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for a further 24 h, after which time the cells were assessed for PP2A activity. Alternatively, the cells were retransfected with the pcDNA3 HA-RACK1 vectors described above. siRNA 1 and siRNA 2 have been described previously (14Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RACK1 Truncation Mutations—C-terminal RACK1 truncation mutations were generated by PCR and designed so that they could be cloned “in frame” into a pcDNA3 vector containing the HA coding sequence. HA-RACK1 WT was used as a template using the following primers: RACK1 forward, 5′-ATCGGTCGACCCATGACTGAGCAGATG; ΔWD7, 5′-CATTCTAGATTCATCTACAATGATCTT; RACK1 ΔWD6, 5′-CATTCTAGAGAGATCCCATAACATGGC. After confirmation of the DNA sequence and “in frame” cloning with the HA tag, the RACK1 truncation plasmids pcDNA3 HA-RACK1 ΔWD7 and pcDNA3 HA-RACK1 ΔWD6 were prepared for transfection using Qiagen Midi-prep plasmid preparation kits. FAGY-AAAF and Y302F Mutation—The cloning of pcDNA3 HA-RACK1 has already been described (8Kiely P.A. Sant A. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22581-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For mutation of the FAGY sequence of amino acids in RACK1, the section of RACK1 from BamHI (cut position 610) to the end of RACK1 together with an ApaI site at the 3′-end was synthesized (with FAGY changed to AAAF) and sequenced by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) in the pUC57 plasmid. The BamHI to ApaI fragment (352 bp) was cut from pUC57 and ligated into pcDNA3 HA-RACK1, which had already been digested with BamHI and ApaI to generate pcDNA3 HA-RACK1 AAAF. To generate the Y302F single mutation, a two-step PCR procedure was employed using pcDNA3 HA-RACK1 as a template together with the following primers: Primer 1, 5′ TCTCCAGATGGATCCCTCTGT; Primer 2, 5′ CGAAGGCAAACACCTTTACAC; Primer 3, 5′ GTCCGTGAAGCCAGCAAACAG; Primer 4, 5′ AAGGGCCCCTAGCGTGTGCCAAT. The PCR product was cloned into Gem T-easy for sequencing. When the mutation was confirmed, the BamHI/ApaI piece with the Y302F mutation was digested out and ligated into pcDNA3 HA-RACK1, which had already been digested with BamHI and ApaI to generate pcDNA3 HA-RACK1 Y302F. Preparation of Cellular Protein Extracts and Immunoprecipitation—Cellular protein extracts were prepared by washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraping into lysis buffer consisting of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 (1 mm), and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (1 μm), and aprotinin (1.5 μg/ml). After incubation at 4 °C for 20 min, nuclear and cellular debris were removed by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins, extracts from stimulated or unstimulated cells were initially precleared using bovine serum albumin-coated protein G-agarose beads (15 μl of beads per 400 μg of total protein in 700 μl of lysis buffer) by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. The lysates were recovered from the beads by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min and transferred to fresh tubes for incubation with primary antibody (3 μg of each antibody) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were obtained by adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed (three times) with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the immune complexes were then removed from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—All protein samples for Western blot analysis were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels and then transferred to cellulose membranes, which were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% milk (w/v). All primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody incubations were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Where indicated, membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, 1% SDS, and 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by extensive washing in 0.2% and 0.05% TBS-T. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used for detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal from Pierce) for detection of HA-tagged RACK1 truncations. In all other cases, we used Alexa Fluor 680- and 800-coupled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences Cambridge, UK) for Western blot analyses, and detection was performed using an Odyssey® infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Cambridge, UK). Cell Proliferation and Plating Efficiency Assays—Proliferation rates of MCF-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3HA/RACK1 WT, RACK1 FAGY-AAAF, RACK1 Y302F, or empty pcDNA3 vector were measured in monolayer culture and compared with the untransfected MCF-7 cells. Following a 24-h culture, the cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed with serum-free medium, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at a final density of 3.0 × 104 cells/well in multiple wells of a 24-well plate. At regular intervals (48, 72, and 96 h post-transfection), the cells were removed from triplicate wells, and the viability and numbers were assessed using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer. Spot Synthesis of Peptides and Overlay Analysis—Peptide libraries of RACK1 were produced by automatic SPOT synthesis (22Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar) and synthesized on continuous cellulose membrane supports on Whatman 50 cellulose using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry with the AutoSpot-Robot ASS 222 (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments) (22Kramer A.

Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of the spotted RACK1 peptides with purified β1 integrin and recombinant active PP2A was determined by overlaying the cellulose membranes with 10 μg/ml of recombinant protein, as previously described (25Baillie G.S. Adams D.R. Bhari N. Houslay T.M. Vadrevu S. Meng D. Li X. Dunlop A. Milligan G. Bolger G.B. Klussmann E. Houslay M.D. Biochem.

Bound recombinant PP2A and β1 integrin was detected with specific mouse (PP2A) and rabbit antisera (β1 integrin) and a secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Once the binding site of both PP2A and β1 integrin on the full-length RACK1 array was determined, specific alanine-scanning substitution arrays were generated for the last 19 amino acids of spot C18 as described above. To generate the peptide phosphorylated on Tyr-302, a new array was made, and the tyrosine at position 302 was replaced with a phosphorylated tyrosine residue, and the array was overlaid with test proteins as above. Phosphatase Assays for PP2A Activity—Cellular PP2A phosphatase activity was measured using para-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) as the substrate with the serine/threonine phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Cells (R+ or MCF-7) were serum-starved for 4 h (or, when required, preincubated with okadaic acid (10 nm) for 1 h) prior to stimulation with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin) for 20 min on ice. Nuclear and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Clarified supernatants were incubated with anti-PP2A (3 μg) antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 30 μl of precoated protein G-agarose beads for 3 h. Precoated beads were prepared by incubating beads with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS-Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer and once with assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm calcium chloride) by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min and resuspended in assay buffer containing 2.5 mm nickel chloride and 900 μgof p-NPP/ml and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. The amount of para-nitrophenol produced was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Assays were performed with triplicate samples. Transwell Migration Assays—MCF-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3HA/RACK1 WT, RACK1 FAGY-AAAF, RACK1 Y302F, or empty pcDNA3 vector were cultured in 10-cm plates. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h before removing with trypsin, washed twice, and then resuspended in serum-free medium. The final cell density was determined using a hemocytometer. The lower wells of the Transwell chamber apparatus were loaded with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml IGF-I (final concentration). A 50-μl volume of cell suspension containing 100,000 cells was added to each upper well. The loaded chamber was incubated for 16 or 24 h, at which time the chamber was removed from the incubator and disassembled. Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by scraping so that only cells that had migrated through the membrane remained. The membrane was then fixed with methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and air-dried. Cell counts were obtained by counting all cells, and data are presented as an average of counts from five fields of triplicate wells for each test condition. The WD6 and -7 Domains of RACK1 Contain Binding Sites for PP2A and β1 Integrin—We have previously demonstrated (14Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that both PP2A and β1 integrin associate with the C terminus of RACK1 (WD repeats 4–7) and that they do so in a mutually exclusive manner. In contrast, the IGF-IR was shown to interact within WD repeats 1–4 of RACK1 (14Kiely P.A. O'Gorman D. Luong K. Ron D. O'Connor R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To define the binding site of both PP2A and β1 integrin on RACK1, we initially generated C-terminal truncation mutations of HA-RACK1, in which either the entire WD7 (dWD7) or both the WD6 and WD7 domains (dWD6/7) were deleted (Fig. 1). MCF-7 cells were transfected with dWD7 and dWD6/7 or WT HA-RACK1 as a control. Each protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody and tested for associated PP2A, β1 integrin, and IGF-IR by Western blotting. Results show that both PP2A and β1 integrin associated with HA-RACK1 WT. PP2A did not associate with dWD7, whereas a small amount of β1 integrin was associated with this mutant. However, β1 integrin did not interact with the dWD6/WD7 mutant. The IGF-IR was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with all of the RACK1 proteins, which confirmed that the truncation mutations maintained correct folding inside the cell. Overall, from these results, we conclude that the PP2A binding site resides in WD7 of RACK1 but that β1 integrin has binding sites in both WD6 and WD7 of RACK1. Identification of the Shared Binding Site in RACK1 for PP2A and β1 Integrin as the FAGY Cluster—We next focused on identifying the precise amino acids within WD7 of RACK1 that may constitute a common binding site for PP2A and β1 integrin. To do this, we employed a peptide array analysis procedure that we recently used to identify the binding site for RACK1 on PDE4D5 (26Bolger G.B. Baillie G.S. Li X. Lynch M.J. Herzyk P. Mohamed A. Mitchell L.H. McCahill A. Hundsrucker C. Klussmann E. Adams D.R. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and to identify the interaction sites on β-arrestin 2 for binding of PDE4D5 (25Baillie G.S. Adams D.R. Bhari N. Houslay T.M. Vadrevu S. Meng D. Li X. Dunlop A. Milligan G. Bolger G.B. Klussmann E. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A library of overlapping peptides (25-mers), each shifted by 5 amino acids, encompassing the entire sequence of RACK1 was spot-synthesized on membranes. Duplicate membranes were then probed with purified β1 integrin or with purified active catalytic subunit of PP2A (Fig. 2). Probing the RACK1 peptide library with purified PP2A yielded a positive reaction (indicated by dark spots) with peptide spot C18 (SADGQTLFAGYTDNLVRVW), which corresponded to a sequence in the WD7 domain of RACK1. Probing the RACK1 peptide array with β1 integrin yielded two positive reactions. One was in WD6 (C2), and one was in WD7 (C18), which corresponds to the same site as that for PP2A. These data are in agreement with observations from the RACK1 deletion mutants (Fig. 1), which indicated a requirement of WD7 for both PP2A and β1 integrin interaction and also indicated an additional site in WD6 required for the interaction of β1 integrin with RACK1. To gain further insight into the identity of specific amino acids of RACK1 required for PP2A and β1 integrin binding to RACK1, we next used alanine-scanning arrays. Arrays of peptides derived from the 25-mer parent peptides corresponding to spot C18 (Ser-292 to Trp-310), in which each new peptide had a single alanine substitution in successive amino acids, were again probed with purified PP2A or β1 integrin. The binding of PP2A and β1 integrin to the peptide spots was measured by densitometry and presented as a percentage of the binding of each protein to the control “parent” peptide. Results showed that the binding of both PP2A and β1 integrin to RACK1 was either severely disrupted or lost by alanine substitution of any one of four consecutive amino acids Phe-299, Ala-300, Gly-301, and Tyr-302 (Fig. 3). The binding of PP2A to RACK1 was also decreased when the single isolated amino acids Gly-295, Leu-298, Asn-305, Arg-308, and Trp-310 were substituted for alanine, whereas β1 integrin binding was decreased by substitution of Ala-293, Arg-308, and Trp-310. Since alanine substitution of the consecutive FAGY residues had the most deleterious effect on binding of both PP2A and β1 integrin to RACK1, we co"
https://openalex.org/W2000531252,"A prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of dopamine in the striatum, and many therapeutic interventions for the disease are aimed at restoring dopamine signaling. Dopamine signaling includes the synthesis, storage, release, and recycling of dopamine in the presynaptic terminal and activation of pre- and post-synaptic receptors and various downstream signaling cascades. As an aid that might facilitate our understanding of dopamine dynamics in the pathogenesis and treatment in PD, we have begun to merge currently available information and expert knowledge regarding presynaptic dopamine homeostasis into a computational model, following the guidelines of biochemical systems theory. After subjecting our model to mathematical diagnosis and analysis, we made direct comparisons between model predictions and experimental observations and found that the model exhibited a high degree of predictive capacity with respect to genetic and pharmacological changes in gene expression or function. Our results suggest potential approaches to restoring the dopamine imbalance and the associated generation of oxidative stress. While the proposed model of dopamine metabolism is preliminary, future extensions and refinements may eventually serve as an in silico platform for prescreening potential therapeutics, identifying immediate side effects, screening for biomarkers, and assessing the impact of risk factors of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2062559784,"Halobacterium salinarum sensory rhodopsin I (HsSRI), a dual receptor regulating both negative and positive phototaxis in haloarchaea, transmits light signals through changes in protein-protein interactions with its transducer, halobacterial transducer protein I (HtrI). Haloarchaea also have another sensor pigment, sensory rhodopsin II (SRII), which functions as a receptor regulating negative phototaxis. Compared with HsSRI, the signal relay mechanism of SRII is well characterized because SRII from Natronomonus pharaonis (NpSRII) is much more stable than HsSRI and HsSRII, especially in dilute salt solutions and is much more resistant to detergents. Two genes encoding SRI homologs were identified from the genome sequence of the eubacterium Salinibacter ruber. Those sequences are distantly related to HsSRI (∼40% identity) and contain most of the amino acid residues identified as necessary for its function. To determine whether those genes encode functional protein(s), we cloned and expressed them in Escherichia coli. One of them (SrSRI) was expressed well as a recombinant protein having all-trans retinal as a chromophore. UV-Vis, low-temperature UV-Vis, pH-titration, and flash photolysis experiments revealed that the photochemical properties of SrSRI are similar to those of HsSRI.

Struct. 1997; 26: 223-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The original state of SRI and its long-lived photointermediate (the M-intermediate) are important for positive and negative phototaxis, respectively, and have absorption maxima at 587 and 373 nm, respectively. Sensory rhodopsin II (SRII, also known as phoborhodopsin) is a negative phototaxis receptor in haloarchaea, including H. salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis. Those are called HsSRII and NpSRII, respectively, and their absorption maxima are at about 500 nm (3Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, haloarchaea are attracted to light with wavelengths longer than 520 nm, and they avoid light with wavelengths shorter than 520 nm because of the functions of SRI and SRII (2Hoff W.D. Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 223-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Light >520 nm can activate the ion pumping rhodopsins, bacteriorhodopsin (BR), and halorhodopsin (HR), to obtain light energy, and cells avoid light of shorter wavelengths that contain harmful near-UV radiation (2Hoff W.D. Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 223-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).HsSRI and NpSRII form 2:2 signaling complexes with their cognate halobacterial transducer proteins (Htr), HsHtrI and NpHtrII, in membranes, and transmit light signals through changes in protein-protein interactions (4Sasaki J. Nara T. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 1321-1330PubMed Google Scholar). The excitation light absorbed by HsSRI and NpSRII triggers trans-cis isomerization of the retinal chromophore that is covalently bound to a conserved lysine residue via a protonated Schiff base linkage (5Yan B.

This photoexcitation results in the sequential appearance of various photointermediates (K, L, M, and O) followed by a return to the unphotolyzed form of the protein (2Hoff W.D. Jung K.H.

Upon formation of the K-intermediate, light activates the photoisomerization of retinal in NpSRII, which leads to steric constraint between Thr-204NpSRII and C14-H in the retinal chromophore (12Sudo Y.

Upon formation of the active M-intermediate, helix-F of NpSRII moves toward NpHtrII, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (16Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). At its distal end, activated NpHtrII binds a cytoplasmic histidine kinase, CheA. CheA phosphorylates a phosphoregulator (CheY) that binds to the flagellar motor switch and controls the swimming reversal probability of the cell (19Rudolph J. Tolliday N. Schmitt C. Schuster S.C. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4249-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, compared with HsSRI, the signal relay mechanism of NpSRII is well characterized by various methods (21Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), because NpSRII is much more stable than H. salinarum SRII (22Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), especially in dilute salt solutions, and is much more resistant to detergents whereas HsSRI is unstable under those conditions. Therefore, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) of interactions between SRI and HtrI, about structural changes, or about the signal relay mechanism of positive phototaxis.New genes encoding the sensory rhodopsin I-like protein have been recently discovered through genome sequencing of S. ruber (23Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. Daugherty S. Deboy R.T. Wister J. Khouri H. Weidman J. Walsh D.A. Papke R.T. Sanchez Perez G. Sharma A.K. Nesbo C.L. MacLeod D. Bapteste E. Doolittle W.F. Charlebois R.L. Legault B. Rodriguez-Valera F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18147-18152Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We present here the first characterization of SRI from the eubacterium S. ruber (SrSRI). SrSRI has all-trans retinal as a chromophore, has a longer absorption maximum (558 nm) than does SRII (500 nm), and has a slower photocycle than the light-driven ion-pumping rhodopsins (BR, HR, and proteorhodopsin), indicating similarities to the prototypic SRI (HsSRI) (1Spudich J.L. Bogomolni R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). SrSRI could be expressed in Escherichia coli and shows very high stability, even in detergent micelles, making it possible to prepare large amounts of protein. This also allows preparation of mutant SrSRI, which will allow new approaches to investigate the photosignaling process in the SRI-HtrI system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Strains—S. ruber (a kind gift from Dr. Dyall-Smith) was grown aerobically at 40 °C at pH 7.0 in medium with the following composition (g/liter): NaCl, 195; MgSO4·7H2O, 25; MgCl2·6H2O, 16.3; CaCl2·2H2O, 1.25; KCl, 5.0; NaHCO3, 0.25; NaBr, 0.625; and yeast extract (Difco), 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were stored at –80 °C. Genomic DNA was prepared using the method of Marmur (24Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8956) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α was used as a host for DNA manipulation, and BL21(DE3) was used for expressing the genes. For DNA manipulation, the sensory rhodopsin I gene (SRU_2511) was amplified using PCR from the genomic DNA of S. ruber. The forward primer 5′-CATATGGACCCGATTACGATCGTCTA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGGGCGGCAGACGTGACTGTCGC-3′ were designed (underlining indicates the restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI, respectively). The stop codon was deleted during amplification. The NdeI and XhoI fragment was ligated to NdeI and XhoI sites of pET21c(+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Consequently, the plasmid encodes six histidines at the C terminus, and it was named pTK001. This cloning strategy resulted in the following N- and C-terminal peptide sequences: 1MDPI----TSAA239LEHHHHHH. The constructed plasmid was analyzed using an automated sequencer to confirm the expected nucleotide sequence. Another SRI gene, SRU_2579, was amplified and cloned using almost the same strategy as SRU_2511, except for the use of the restriction site NheI instead of NdeI.Protein Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution into PG Liposomes—Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (final concentration of 100 μg/ml). E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pTK001 was grown to an A660 of 0.3–0.5 in a 30 °C incubator, followed by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 10 μm all-trans retinal. Cells were harvested at 3-h postinduction by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5) containing 4 m NaCl, and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by a low speed centrifugation (5,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). For solubilization of the membranes, 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) was added, and the suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The solubilized membranes were isolated by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was incubated with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) superflow (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 30 min. Thereafter, the Ni-NTA resin was poured into a chromatography column and was washed extensively with buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.0) containing 4 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% w/v DM to remove unspecifically bound proteins. The histidine-tagged proteins were then eluted with buffer (0.1% DM, 4 m NaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 300 mm imidazole). The purified SrSRI sample was then reconstituted into PG liposomes. For reconstitution of l-α-phosphatidylglycerol (Sigma) lipids, the lipids were dissolved in chloroform, and a thin lipid film on the wall of a flask was prepared by careful evaporation of the solvent. SrSRI in buffer (0.1% DM, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 mm imidazole) was added (at an SrSRI:PG molar ratio of 1:50), and the suspension was gently stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Reconstitution by detergent removal was performed using Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad), as previously described (25Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The expression plasmid of HsSRI was constructed essentially as described previously (9Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Kato S. Hasegawa C. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1274-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HsSRI, with a tag of six histidines at the C-terminal end, was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Preparation of crude membranes and purification of protein were done as described previously (25Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Room Temperature and Low Temperature UV-Vis Spectroscopy and HPLC Analysis—Room temperature UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a UV2400PC spectrophotometer with an ISR240A integrating sphere (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The PG-reconstituted sample was washed and resuspended in six buffers (citric acid, MES, HEPES, MOPS, CHES, and CAPS, whose concentrations were 10 mm each) with 1 m NaCl. The buffer composition had the same buffer capacity over a wide range of pH values (2Hoff W.D. Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Nozaki D. Tokutomi S. Kagawa T. Wada M. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8183-8191Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The PG-reconstituted sample with 5 mm NaCl and 2 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was placed on a BaF2 window, and then was dried to a film under reduced pressure with an aspirator. The films were hydrated with water. SrSRIK minus SrSRI difference spectra were measured at 77 K, as follows: Illumination of the SrSRI film with >450 nm light for 2 min, after which at pH 7.0 and 77 K converted SrSRI to SrSRIK, and subsequent illumination with >640 nm light for 1 min forced SrSRIK to revert to SrSRI. SrSRIM minus SrSRI difference spectra were measured at 200 K and pH 7.0 as follows: To convert SrSRI to SrSRIM, the sample was irradiated with >480 nm light for 2 min, after which a subsequent 1-min illumination with UV light-changed SrSRIM back to SrSRI. The difference spectrum was calculated from the spectra before and after the illumination.High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed as described previously (27Shimono K. Ikeura Y. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1515: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The PG-reconstituted sample was analyzed in buffer (1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0). The HPLC system consisted of a PU-2080 pump and a UV-2075 UV/Vis detector (JASCO). The chromatograph was equipped with a silica column (6.0 × 150 mm; YMC-Pack SIL), the solvent was 12% (v/v) ethyl acetate and 0.12% (v/v) ethanol in hexane, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Extraction of retinal oxime from the sample was carried out by hexane after denaturation by methanol and 500 mm hydroxylamine at 4 °C. The molar composition of retinal isomers was calculated from the areas of the peaks monitored at 360 nm. Assignment of each peak was performed by comparing it with the HPLC pattern from retinal oximes of authentic all-trans- and 13-cis-retinals. For the light-adapted SrSRI, the sample was irradiated with >480 nm light for 1 min. Two independent measurements were averaged.Time-resolved Laser Spectroscopy—The purified sample in DM detergent micelles was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% DM, and 1 m NaCl. Flash-induced absorption changes in the 300–700-nm region in the millisecond to second time window with a 10-ms interval were acquired using a commercial flash photolysis system (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Hamamatsu, Japan), which consisted of a CCD linear detector (Photonic Multichannel Spectral Analyzer PMA-11 C8808–01), a CW xenon lamp L8004 as a light source and a sample room (flash photolysis optics C9125). Excitation of the SrSRI samples was done by 556-nm nanosecond laser pulses (FWHM; 3.5 nm) from a Nd-YAG laser apparatus (LS-2134UT-10; LOTIS TII: 355 nm, 7 ns, 60 mJ) through an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) (LT-2214-OPO/PM; LOTIS TII). The repetition rate of the laser pulses was 10 Hz and was reduced to 0.5 Hz using a beam shutter unit (BD-10MN-OPO; LOTIS TII) and a frequency divider to wait for completion of the photocycle of SrSRI. The energy of one laser pulse is 3.8 mJ. Synchronization of data acquisition and laser triggering was performed using a delay pulse generator (DG535; Stanford Research Systems, Location Sunnyvale, CA). For signal-to-noise improvement, twenty photoreactions were averaged for one time slice and 3 sets of time-resolved light-induced difference spectra were recorded and averaged for a sample solution (experiment length of ∼6 h). Two experiments were performed and in all, 6 sets of transient spectra were averaged. The bleach of the sample was negligible (∼5%) in each experiment. The temperature of the sample was kept at 20 °C by circulating water through a thermoregulated bath (NCB-1200; EYELA, Tokyo, Japan).Protein Stability in Low Salt Conditions—Absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer. To monitor the effects of salt concentration on the absorbance of SRI, PG-reconstituted samples were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0. Samples were taken at different time intervals, and the absorption spectra were measured.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTwo Sensory Rhodopsin I-like Proteins in the Genome of S. ruber—The genome sequence of S. ruber contains two genes coding for sensory rhodopsin I (SRU_2511, which are named SrSRI, and SRU_2579). To date, these are the only examples (other than sensory proteorhodopsin from γ-proteobacteria) of an SRI gene discovered outside the Archaea (28Spudich J.L. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 480-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the properties of sensory proteorhodopsin have not been identified yet, because it is not expressed in E. coli, Pichia pastoris, or H. salinarum. The sequences of SRU_2511(SrSRI) and SRU_2579 are distantly related to HsSRI (∼40% identity) (29Yao V.J. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fig. 1 shows the secondary structure of SRI-like proteins from S. ruber. It is well known that the sensory rhodopsins have seven transmembrane domains and that retinal is the chromophore. A lysine (Lys-205) and an aspartate residue (Asp-72), predicted to be necessary for stabilization of the Schiff base and for the binding between protein and retinal, are completely conserved among SRIs (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, His-166, one of the most important residues for active site proton transfer and phototaxis signaling (31Zhang X.N. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1516-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in HsSRI is replaced by Tyr in one of the sensory rhodopsin I-like proteins from S. ruber (SRU_2511). These genes, SRU_2511 and SRU_2579, which have a downstream sequence are immediately followed by the same second gene in a probable operon that is under the control of the same promoter as rhodopsin. These putative transducer genes (SRU_2510, Htr for SRU_2511, and SRU_2580, Htr for SRU_2579) encode a ∼650-residue protein with two transmembrane domains at the N-terminal portion followed by an extensive domain with primarily hydrophilic residues. This topology is similar to that of the Htr transducers from the archaeon H. salinarum (34Seidel R. Scharf B. Gautel M. Kleine K. Oesterhelt D. Engelhard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3036-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The eubacterium, S. ruber, also has two light-driven ion pumps, Xanthorhodopsin and a Halorhodopsin-like protein, making an energy source for living cells (23Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. Daugherty S.

The sensory rhodopsins would function as a positive phototaxis sensor against longer wavelengths of light (where ion pumping rhodopsins can utilize light energy) and as a negative phototaxis sensor against shorter wavelengths of light (which contains harmful UV).Protein Expression, Purification, and Absorption Spectrum—To determine whether the genes encode functional proteins, we cloned and expressed the two sensory rhodopsins, SRU_2511 and SRU_2579, in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Using PCR, we obtained a fragment containing the full-length of the SRU_2511 and SRU_2579 gene coding regions. An NdeI site was created at the translation initiation site in the PCR product using an oligonucleotide primer containing the NdeI site. A XhoI site was created, and the stop codon was deleted during the amplification. The NdeI and XhoI fragment of the PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET21c(+). Induction of E. coli BL21(DE3) with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside caused growth inhibition, suggesting they expressed the desired protein. Actually, upon addition of retinal, a color change of the SRU_2511-transformed cells was recognized, and the color was definitely distinct from cells transformed only by the vector pET21c(+), whereas cells containing SRU_2579 did not show any visible color, implying it was not expressed in the E. coli cells. SRU_2511 is hereafter called SrSRI. Purified SrSRI was reconstituted into PG liposomes, and the absorption spectrum was obtained as shown in Fig. 2. The absorption maximum of SrSRI is located at 558 nm. That maximum wavelength is similar to that of HsSRI (587 nm) (1Spudich J.L. Bogomolni R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and is significantly different from the sensory rhodopsin II whose maximum is located at around 500 nm (36Takahashi T. Yan B.

Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is a candidate nutrient-sensing pathway. We hypothesized that altered nutrient sensing (by HBP) with age may provide a link among aging, nutrient flux, and insulin resistance. Using a hyperinsulinemic clamp in young rats, we show that experimental activation of HBP, through the systemic infusion of glucosamine, induced severe insulin resistance (36% decline in peripheral insulin action; P<0.05), increased adipose tissue gene expression of fat-derived peptides (PAI-1 by 4-fold, angiotensinogen 3-fold, leptin 2-fold, resistin 4-fold, and adiponectin 4-fold; P<0.01 compared with young saline-infused), and enhanced glycosylation of transcription factors, thus mimicking a physiological and biological phenotype of aging. We further demonstrate a greater activation of nutrient-sensing HBP with age in both old ad libitum-fed and calorie-restricted rats. Interestingly, old calorie-restricted animals rapidly develop insulin resistance when exposed to glucosamine, despite their ""young"" phenotype. These results suggest that altered nutrient sensing by HBP with age may be the link among nutrients, insulin resistance, and age-related diabetes."

GroEL is a large cylindrical protein complex comprising two heptameric rings of identical 57-kDa subunits, and these rings are stacked back to back (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C.

Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A large conformational change induced by ATP binding to GroEL promotes the formation of the GroEL-GroES complex (10Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The GroEL ring that binds ATP and GroES is called the cis-ring, and it has a cavity for the encapsulation of the substrate protein (the cis-cavity) (12Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y.

The origin of the asymmetry in the GroEL-GroES complex is explained by the nested cooperativity in the ATP binding, the positive cooperativity within the same GroEL rings, and the negative cooperativity between the two rings (14Horovitz A. Willison K.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The most efficient manner of GroEL-GroES-assisted folding involves the substrate protein (up to ∼57 kDa (15Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

ATP hydrolysis in the cis-ring results in the formation of the asymmetric ADP-bound GroEL-GroES complex (called the “ADP bullet”). Subsequent ATP binding to the opposite side of the GroEL ring (the trans-ring) induces the release of GroES, ADP, and the encapsulated substrate (either folded or not (16Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V.

The availability of the substrate-saturated GroEL prompted us to examine whether the ATP bullet, formed from the substrate-saturated GroEL, retains the bound substrate in the trans-ring because the previous experiment using EL398 started from the GroEL mutant without bound substrates. In this study, we addressed this question and found that the bound substrate in the trans-ring remained bound during the GroEL cycle. In addition, we reevaluated the mechanism of EL398 and unexpectedly found a discrepancy between our results and those from a previous study (20Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We resolved the apparent discrepancy by a careful reexamination of EL398. Revisiting the GroEL cycle model implied an efficient two-stroke mechanism (25Lorimer G. Nature. 1997; 388: 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) via the symmetric football complex.

The trace amount of contaminating ATP in the ADP solution was eliminated by a hexokinase/glucose treatment (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

The following proteins were purified and prepared as described previously: wild-type and mutant GroEL, GroES, and bovine mitochondrial rhodanese (26Motojima F. Makio T. Aoki K. Makino Y. Kuwajima K. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); Rubisco from Rhodospirillum rubrum (19Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z.

Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE Analysis of GroEL-GroES-Substrate Ternary Complexes—GroEL and EL398, which had been saturated with denatured rhodanese, were prepared as described previously (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, rhodanese was heat-denatured at 60 °C for 15 min in HKM buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) containing GroEL. To initiate the GroEL ATPase cycle, the solution containing GroEL (or EL398), which was saturated with rhodanese, and GroES in HKM buffer was mixed with a 2-fold volume of the solution containing ATP and then incubated at 25 °C. The final concentrations of the components in the reaction mixtures were as follows: 1 mm ATP, 0.5 μm GroEL or EL398 saturated with rhodanese, 1.0 μm GroES, 200 mm glucose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Na2S2O3. For the single turnover ATP hydrolysis experiment (denoted “ATPsingle”), the excess ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP by adding hexokinase (final concentration, 0.04 units/μl) to the reaction mixture at 3 s after the initiation of the reaction (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine the amounts of GroES and rhodanese bound to GroEL or EL398, the released GroES and rhodanese were removed by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-100, Millipore). Subsequently, proteinase K (final concentration, 1 μg/ml) was added to an aliquot of the solution. Following an incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the components with molecular masses <100 kDa were removed by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-100). The retained solution was analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE. The intensity of the band staining was quantified using the ImageJ program and was calibrated using known protein concentrations. To quantify the amount of GroES bound to EL398, EL398-GroES complexes formed in the presence of ATP, ADP, ATP with 10 mm NaF and 1 mm BeCl2, or ADP with 10 mm NaF and 1 mm BeCl2 were also analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE as described above. Rhodanese Folding Assay—The folding assays were conducted in HKM buffer including 200 mm glucose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Na2S2O3. The final concentrations were 0.5 μm GroEL or EL398 saturated with rhodanese and 1.5 μm GroES. Folding was initiated by the addition of either ATP or ADP at a final concentration of 1 mm. For the single turnover ATP hydrolysis reactions, the excess ATP was removed by adding hexokinase (final concentration, 0.04 units/μl) to the reaction mixture at 3 s after the initiation of the reaction. For the repeated single turnover experiment (see Fig. 1B), additional ATP (final concentration, 5 mm) was mixed in the reaction mixture at 25 min after the initiation of the first single turnover experiment. At the times indicated, the folding was quenched by mixing aliquots of the solution with 750 μl of a solution containing 100 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm Na2S2O3, and 1 mm EDTA. After the quench, the enzymatic assay was initiated by adding 250 μl of 0.25 m KCN at 25 °C and was stopped by adding 200 μl of 37% formaldehyde after 15 min. After the further addition of 0.5 ml of ferric nitrate reagent (100 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 200 ml of HNO3, brought to 1000 ml with H2O), the rhodanese activity was measured colorimetrically by the absorbance at 460 nm (28Sörbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar), indicating the formation of a complex between the ferric ions and the thiocyanate reaction product. Binding Assay Using Gel Filtration—The ATP bullet and the ATP football complexes of EL398 were formed by mixing 1.5 μm EL398 with 1.5 μm and 3 μm GroES, respectively, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP in HKM buffer to initiate the ATP hydrolysis reaction (t = 0). Following an incubation for 30 s at 25 °C, the complexes were isolated by gel filtration (PD-10 column, GE Healthcare) in the same buffer. The capacity of binding of the complexes or unliganded EL398 to GroES was then examined by mixing 0.5 μm complexes or unliganded EL398 with 1 μm Cy3-GroES in 1 mm ATP at the indicated times following the initiation of ATP hydrolysis. The capacity of binding of the complexes or unliganded EL398 to denatured substrates was examined by mixing 0.5 μm complexes or unliganded EL398 with either 0.25 μm urea-denatured Cy3-rhodanese or 0.25 μm acid-denatured Cy3-Rubisco at the indicated times following the initiation. After a 5-min incubation at 25 °C, the samples were analyzed with a gel filtration HPLC column (G3000SWXL, Tosoh Corp.). Aliquots were loaded onto the column, which was equilibrated with HKM buffer containing 50 mm Na2SO4. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the elution profile was monitored for the Cy3 fluorescence using an in-line fluorometer (excitation at 550 nm and emission at 570 nm). Quantification of Bound Nucleotides—To analyze the bound nucleotides in the EL398-GroES complex, we mixed 2 μm EL398, 4 μm GroES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. After 5 min, aliquots were rapidly subjected to gel filtration using three TSK-GEL guard columns (Tosoh Corp.) connected in series and equilibrated with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 100 mm Na2SO4, and 5 mm MgSO4. The isolated EL398 complexes were treated with perchloric acid (final concentration, 1.0%), and the supernatant was neutralized with K2CO3. The supernatants were applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column (ODS-80Ts, Tosoh Corp.) for the separation of ATP and ADP by monitoring the absorbance at 260 nm (29Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M.

The amount of nucleotide was calculated by the integrated peak area and was calibrated using known nucleotide concentrations. Denatured Rhodanese Bound to the trans-Ring Remains Bound during GroEL-GroES Cycling—We have developed a method to prepare substrate-saturated GroEL, in which the substrates are bound to both of the GroEL rings (22Motojima F.

The addition of ATP and GroES to the substrate-saturated GroEL results in the formation of an ATP-bound asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

What is the fate of the other substrate bound to the trans-ring? Although an earlier key experiment in which the ATP-bound asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex (ATP bullet) could not bind the substrate protein in the trans-ring (20Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) suggested that the other substrate in the trans-ring should be released, no experiments were performed to clarify this point. To address this question, we prepared the substrate-saturated GroEL. The saturation protocol reproducibly resulted in the binding of 2.5∼3 mol of denatured rhodanese/mol of GroEL tetradecamer (Fig. 1A) (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We note that both of the rhodanese-bound GroEL rings efficiently bound GroES as evident from our previous studies (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The rhodanese bound to GroEL was completely digested by proteinase K (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the bound rhodanese was in a protease-susceptible state. ATP was then added in the presence of GroES to initiate the GroEL ATPase cycle. After the reaction proceeded for 3 s, hexokinase was added to the solution (containing glucose) to hydrolyze all of the free ATP to prevent a second GroEL ATPase cycle. After the single turnover experiment (referred to as ATPsingle (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), the GroEL complexes were treated with proteinase K to digest the exposed denatured rhodanese and then subjected to ultrafiltration (100-kDa cutoff membrane) to separate the digested/released rhodanese or GroES. Quantification of GroES based on the band densities revealed that 1.0 mol of GroES/mol of GroEL was retained in the isolated GroEL-GroES complex (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4), confirming the efficient formation of the asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex in the single turnover experiment using the rhodanese-saturated GroEL. The release of bound rhodanese from the trans-ring, as predicted from the current GroEL model, should result in no difference in the band intensity of rhodanese with or without the protease treatment. However, we found that the 2.8 mol of rhodanese preloaded with the GroEL-GroES complex had been reduced to 1.2 mol after the protease treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Because 1.0 mol of GroES was retained in the isolated ternary complex, the protease-protected rhodanese is considered to have been encapsulated in the cis-cavity (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 962-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of the protease-susceptible rhodanese would indicate the retention of the substrate by the trans-ring after the completion of the single turnover experiment. Next, we tested whether the folding of the trans-retained rhodanese is still assisted by GroEL-GroES. As shown in our previous studies (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), ∼2 mol of rhodanese/mol of GroEL tetradecamer was recovered when ATP and GroES were added to the rhodanese-saturated GroEL. In contrast, ADP and GroES did not assist in the folding of rhodanese. The ATPsingle condition resulted in a gradual recovery of the rhodanese activity until it reached a value corresponding to ∼0.8 mol of rhodanese/mol of GroEL (Fig. 1B), showing that the rhodanese encapsulated in the cis-cavity was folded under the ATPsingle condition as reported previously (22Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At 25 min under the ATPsingle condition, ATP was added to the mixture to trigger a second GroEL cycle. The second addition of ATP re-induced the folding of rhodanese, reaching a value of ∼1.4 mol of rhodanese/mol of GroEL, which was almost twice the recovery compared with that before the addition of the second ATP. The second recovery of rhodanese was not inhibited by the inclusion of a trap-GroEL, which binds the substrate but does not release it even in the presence of ATP (12Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), in the solution (data not shown), indicating that the trans-bound substrate was not released into the bulk solution during ATP hydrolysis in the cis-ring. Therefore, we concluded that the trans-ring of the cis-ATP complex retains the substrate that is available for GroEL-GroES-dependent folding. The GroEL(D398A) Mutant Binds Two GroES Heptamers in the Presence of ATP, Producing a Symmetric “ATP Football” Complex—Because the ATPsingle condition experiment was conducted with wild-type GroEL, it was possible that the trans-bound substrate might have been transiently released from the ATP bullet but then bound again to the trans-ring after the formation of the ADP bullet as a result of ATP hydrolysis. To rule out this possibility, we conducted the above protease protection experiment using EL398 because this mutant remains in the ATP-bound form with a half-life of ∼30 min (19Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 20Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), which is long enough to isolate the ATP-bound EL398-GroES complex in our protocol. The release of the trans-bound rhodanese by the ATP-bound EL398 complex should result in the isolation of a trans-free EL398-GroES complex after ultrafiltration. At first, we conducted the ATPsingle condition experiment using EL398 as a control (Fig. 2A). We expected that about half of the bound rhodanese would be digested by proteinase K because the ATPsingle condition should produce the asymmetric ATP bullet complex, which has protease-susceptible rhodanese in the trans-ring. However, we found only a slight reduction in the amount of rhodanese after the protease treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Quantification of the retained rhodanese revealed that 2.7 mol of rhodanese was protected after the protease treatment (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In addition, we noticed that ∼2 mol of GroES/mol of GroEL was bound to the EL398 complex after the completion of a single turnover (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting the formation of a symmetric 1:2 EL398-GroES complex (ATP football). Because the formation of the stable ATP football complex would result in the encapsulation of rhodanese in both cavities, we then compared the recovery of the rhodanese activity using EL398 with that using wild-type GroEL under the ATPsingle condition in the presence of GroES. Strikingly, the recovery of the rhodanese activity assisted by EL398-GroES was almost double that assisted by wild-type GroEL-GroES (Fig. 2B). This means that the EL398-GroES complex has two folding chambers to assist in the folding of ∼2 mol of rhodanese/mol of EL398 tetradecamer, further supporting the formation of the ATP football complex. We next examined whether the substrates are released by the ATP-bound EL398 complex. Separation of the EL398-GroES complex at 1 min after the addition of ATP resulted in the retention of ∼2 mol of the protease-protected rhodanese (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, ∼2 mol of GroES was retained. The retention of both cis- and trans-bound substrates was interpreted as an encapsulation of both substrates in two cis-cavities of the ATP football. The retention of rhodanese was reduced to <1 mol after 120 min (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). This reduction in the amount of retained rhodanese was interpreted as being the consequence of several rounds of EL398 ATPase turnover during the 120-min reaction, resulting in the release of native rhodanese from the EL398-GroES complex. Taken together, our experiments using EL398 strongly suggested the formation of the ATP football complex, which was not observed in previous studies using EL398 (19Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A.

Because our previous experiment using fluoroberyllate (BeFx) revealed that the incubation of GroEL (wild-type) and GroES in the presence of ATP + BeFx and ADP + BeFx resulted in the formation of a stable football (Fig. 3A, lane 4) and a bullet (lane 5), respectively (23Taguchi H.

https://openalex.org/W1987770334,"GroEL is an Escherichia coli chaperonin that is composed of two heptameric rings stacked back-to-back. GroEL assists protein folding with its cochaperonin GroES in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. However, it is still unclear whether GroES binds to both rings of GroEL simultaneously under physiological conditions. In this study, we monitored the GroEL-GroES interaction in the reaction cycle using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We found that nearly equivalent amounts of symmetric GroEL-(GroES)(2) (football-shaped) complex and asymmetric GroEL-GroES (bullet-shaped) complex coexist during the functional reaction cycle. We also found that D398A, an ATP hydrolysis defective mutant of GroEL, forms a football-shaped complex with ATP bound to the two rings. Furthermore, we showed that ADP prevents the association of ATP to the trans-ring of GroEL, and as a consequence, the second GroES cannot bind to GroEL. Considering the concentrations of ADP and ATP in E. coli, ADP is expected to have a small effect on the inhibition of GroES binding to the trans-ring of GroEL in vivo. These results suggest that we should reconsider the chaperonin-mediated protein-folding mechanism that involves the football-shaped complex."
https://openalex.org/W2052329466,"It has been reported previously that inhibitory kappaB kinase (IKK) supports osteoclastogenesis through NF-kappaB-mediated prevention of apoptosis. This finding suggests that the ligand for receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANKL), the master osteoclastogenic cytokine, induces apoptosis of osteoclast precursors (OCPs) in the absence of IKKbeta/NF-kappaB competency. To validate this hypothesis, we sought to determine the pro-apoptotic signaling factors induced by RANKL in IKKbeta-null osteoclast OCPs and to rescue osteoclast differentiation in the absence of IKKbeta through their inhibition. To accomplish this, we generated mice that lack IKKbeta in multiple hematopoietic lineages, including OCPs. We found that these mice possess both in vitro and in vivo defects in osteoclast generation, in concurrence with previous reports, and that this defect is a result of susceptibility to RANKL-mediated apoptosis as a result of gain-of-function of JNK activation. We demonstrate that differentiation of OCPs depends on IKKbeta because reduced IKKbeta mRNA expression correlates with impaired induction of osteoclast differentiation markers in response to RANKL stimulation. We further show that fine-tuned inhibition of JNK activation in these cells inhibits RANKL-induced apoptosis and restores the ability of IKKbeta-null OCPs to become mature osteoclasts. Our data highlight the pro-osteoclastogenic and anti-apoptotic roles of IKKbeta in OCPs and identify a pro-apoptotic mechanism activated within the RANK signalosome."

The present study explores the effects of membrane cholesterol and docosahexaenoic acid content on the peak and magnitude of prestin-associated charge movement in a human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cell model. Increasing membrane cholesterol results in a hyperpolarizing shift in the peak voltage of the nonlinear capacitance (Vpkc) and a decrease in the total charge movement. Both measures depend linearly on membrane cholesterol concentration. Incubation of cholesterol-loaded cells in cholesterol-free media partially restores the Vpkc toward normal values but does not have a compensatory effect on the total charge movement. Decreasing membrane cholesterol results in a depolarizing shift in Vpkc that is restored toward normal values upon incubation in cholesterol-free media. However, cholesterol depletion does not alter the magnitude of charge movement. In contrast, increasing membrane docosahexaenoic acid results in a hyperpolarizing shift in Vpkc that is accompanied by an increase in total charge movement.

After the identification of the role of prestin in OHC electromotility (8Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P.

(Lond.). 2001; 531: 661-666Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated similar Vpkc shifts in prestin-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells with increased turgor pressure. Depolarizing shifts in Vpkc have also been shown in OHCs upon exposure to exogenous fructose (23Geleoc G.S. Casalotti S.O. Forge A. Ashmore J.F. Nat.

Hear Res. 1998; 116: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and HEK cells (29Meltzer J. Santos-Sacchi J. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 313: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with higher temperatures causing depolarizing shifts. Each of these manipulations alters the material properties of the plasma membrane, suggesting that membrane composition itself may be an important factor in prestin function. Cholesterol comprises a significant portion of the plasma membrane of most eukaryotic cells, where the number of cholesterol molecules is nearly the same as the total number of phospholipid molecules (30Cooper G.M.

Cholesterol was shown to influence prestin distribution, self-association, and the voltage dependence of prestin-associated charge movement. Additionally, membrane cholesterol content was found to decrease during OHC maturation, concurrent with the onset and increase in OHC electromotility (14Rajagopalan L. Greeson J.N. Xia A. Liu H.

The effect of cholesterol on prestin function parallels its effect on rhodopsin, a membrane protein that initiates the light cascade in the rod outer segment of the eye (39Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20727-20730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Albert A.D. Boesze-Battaglia K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conversion of rhodopsin to its active form in the stacked disk membranes of the rod outer segment occurs in a gradient that corresponds to the increase in age and decrease in cholesterol content of the disk membranes (41Albert A.D. Boesze-Battaglia K. Paw Z. Watts A. Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin functions optimally in older disks in which membrane cholesterol content is significantly lower (39Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20727-20730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Boesze-Battaglia K. Hennessey T. Albert A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8151-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gradient of increased rhodopsin function also correlates with the presence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (43Mitchell D.C. Straume M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), a polyunsaturated, omega-3 fatty acid (44Zerouga M. Stillwell W. Stone J. Powner A. Jenski L.J. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 2863-2868PubMed Google Scholar). DHA content increases with disk age, concomitant with the increase in rhodopsin function (45Boesze-Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 49: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 46Albert A.D. Young J.E. Paw Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The exact role of membrane composition in rhodopsin function is a topic of active investigation. In the case of prestin, the precise composition of the OHC plasma membrane and its effect on prestin function and hearing remains unknown. In the present study we investigate the effect of changes in membrane cholesterol and DHA content on the magnitude and peak of prestin-associated charge movement in prestin-expressing HEK 293 cells. Prestin Construct and Transfection—Gerbil prestin was cloned into the pIRES-hrGFP vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as a HA-tag fusion protein (HA-prestin) as previously described (15Rajagopalan L. Patel N. Madabushi S. Goddard J.A. Anjan V. Lin F. Shope C. Farrell B. Lichtarge O. Davidson A.L. Brownell W.E. Pereira F.A. J.

Brain Res. 2006; 1091: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). At ∼50–70% confluence, cells were transfected with HA prestin at a 3:2 ratio of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) to DNA. Plates containing transfected cells were incubated for 16–20 h then split into coated microwell Petri dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and incubated for an additional 24–34 h before treatment with lipid-altering agents and performance of electrophysiological measurements. Cholesterol Manipulations—Cholesterol manipulations produce qualitatively similar results in OHCs and prestin-expressing HEK 293 cells, validating the use of HEK 293 cells to study the effects of membrane composition on prestin function (14Rajagopalan L. Greeson J.N. Xia A. Liu H. Sturm A. Raphael R.M. Davidson A.L. Oghalai J.S. Pereira F.A. Brownell W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36659-36670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Steady-state electrophysiological measurements were performed on HA prestin-transfected HEK 293 cells at 40–54 h post-transfection directly after incubation for 30–40 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing either 4 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (Sigma) or water-soluble cholesterol with MβCD as a vehicle (49 mg of cholesterol per gram of cholesterol + MβCD; Sigma). The series of cholesterol concentrations used corresponded to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 mm MβCD concentrations. Additional treatments of cells with altered cholesterol content involved cholesterol manipulation as described above followed by incubation in bathing media composed of cholesterol-free, MβCD-free DMEM. Incubation took place at 37 °C for 60–75 min directly before steady-state electrophysiological measurements. DHA Manipulation—Steady-state electrophysiological measurements were performed on HA prestin-transfected HEK 293 cells at 40–54 h post-transfection directly after incubation for 60–75 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 15 μm DHA (Sigma 6217-54-5) complexed with 5 μm human serum albumin (HSA; Sigma 70024-90-7, St. Louis, MO) as a vehicle. The effects of DHA were followed kinetically by adding DHA to the external solution after the establishment of a whole-cell patch until a final concentration of 75 μm DHA was reached. A higher final concentration of DHA was used to compensate for the lower temperature (room temperature, 23 °C) and shorter incubation timescales of the kinetic experiment. For steady-state treatment with HSA alone, cells were incubated for 60–75 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 5 μm HSA. Kinetic readings were taken with HSA added to the external solution to a 5 μm final concentration after the establishment of a whole cell patch. Electrophysiological Measurements—Electrophysiological data were obtained from cells using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. The recording techniques have been fully described previously (15Rajagopalan L. Patel N. Madabushi S. Goddard J.A. Anjan V. Lin F. Shope C. Farrell B. Lichtarge O. Davidson A.L. Brownell W.E. Pereira F.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12727-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and a brief description follows. Coated microwell Petri dishes containing transfected cells were extensively perfused with an extracellular solution containing Ca2+ and K+ channel blockers (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CoCl2, 1.47 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2) before recording. The dishes were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) under 20× magnification, and all recordings were conducted at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C). Quartz glass patch pipettes with resistances in the range of 1.5–7 megaohms were constructed using a CO2 laser-based micropipette puller (P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Patch pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution containing channel blockers (140 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES) before patching. The pH and osmolality of the external and internal solutions were adjusted to 7.2 ± 0.02 and 300 ± 2 mosm/kg using CsOH or HCl and glucose, respectively. The cell membrane admittance was measured utilizing the patch clamp technique in whole-cell mode. First, an electrical seal >1 gigaohm was formed between the pipette and cell membrane by drawing the two into contact and rapidly applying ∼60 mm Hg negative pressure through the pipette. Next, the compensation circuitry of the amplifier (Axon 200B; Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) was used to correct the pipette capacitance, and whole-cell mode was achieved by gradually increasing the negative pressure through the pipette. Then the cell membrane admittance was measured during a direct current (DC) voltage ramp. The holding potential was 0 mV before and after the ramp and increased at a rate of 300 mV/s during the ramp. The range of the voltage ramp was either −140 to 140 mV or −180 to 140 mV depending on treatment. Voltages were measured relative to an Ag+/AgCl reference electrode in contact with the external solution. The admittance was probed using a dual-frequency stimulus (48Barnett D.W. Misler S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1641-1658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 49Santos-Sacchi J. Kakehata S. Takahashi S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 225-235Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) formed by the sum of two 10-mV (amplitude) sine waves with frequencies of 390.625 Hz and 781.250 Hz. Cell parameters were calculated from the admittance as described previously (50Farrell B. Do Shope C. Brownell W.E. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2006; 73: 041930Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The conductance was also experimentally determined using a DC protocol (15Rajagopalan L. Patel N. Madabushi S. Goddard J.A. Anjan V. Lin F. Shope C. Farrell B. Lichtarge O. Davidson A.L. Brownell W.E. Pereira F.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12727-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 50Farrell B. Do Shope C. Brownell W.E. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2006; 73: 041930Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, a square wave pulse with 10-mV amplitude was applied to the cell through the pipette. At each voltage the current was measured every 10 or 100 μs for a total of 1000 readings (400 points before the pulse, 500 points during the pulse, and 100 points after the pulse), with the longer time intervals used to determine the conductance of cells with high resistances (>4 gigaohms). Conductance was calculated from the change in the steady-state component of measured current relative to the change in voltage. The relationship between current and voltage was also determined using a voltage ramp from −140 to 140 mV in 10-mV steps with 1000 readings taken at 100-μs intervals for each step. A total of 941 HEK 293 cells were patched, and data from 371 cells were used for subsequent analysis. Isolated, non-mobile cells were patched within 60 min of initial exposure to external blocking solution. Data were included or excluded from the final pool based on a combination of parameters; assessment of the patch quality at the time of patching was based on the transient current plot, and the magnitude of the membrane resistance was calculated from the admittance measurements as well as measured directly using the DC protocol. Additional data inclusion criteria included the noise level of the capacitance versus voltage curve, the magnitude of the average membrane resistance (greater than 200 megaohms), the average series resistance (between 2 and 10 megaohms), and the reversal potential (less than −5 mV or greater than +5 mV). The linear capacitance of the cells ranged from 4.8 to 41.6 pF, which based on the specific membrane capacitance for inflated cells (51Solsona C. Innocenti B. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1061-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), represents a range of surface areas from ∼960 to 8300 μm2. Charge density data were excluded if the corresponding Boltzmann fit had an R2 value less than 0.97. For kinetics data, the reversal potential was not used to evaluate the quality of the patch, and assessment was made on a point-by-point rather than cell-by-cell basis, although entire cells were excluded if sufficient data were not present beyond 6 min after patching. For all representations the linear capacitance was subtracted from the calculated capacitance to yield the nonlinear component. This nonlinear component of the capacitance was then normalized relative to the peak capacitance as indicated in the equation below. The linear capacitance was taken as the average capacitance at 5 consecutive voltages centered around 126 mV, where the nonlinear component is negligible. The peak capacitance varied for each cell, Cnorm=C(V)-ClinC(Vpkc)-Clin(Eq. 1) where C(V) is the calculated capacitance at voltage V, C(Vpkc) is the calculated capacitance at peak voltage Vpkc, and Clin is the linear capacitance. Cells in all treatment groups exhibited bell-shaped capacitance versus voltage curves. A Boltzmann function was fit to the NLC curves as described previously (24Oliver D. Fakler B. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the charge density was calculated by dividing the maximum charge transferred (calculated from the area under the Boltzmann curve) by the linear capacitance (15Rajagopalan L. Patel N. Madabushi S. Goddard J.A. Anjan V. Lin F. Shope C. Farrell B. Lichtarge O. Davidson A.L. Brownell W.E. Pereira F.A. J.

Quantification of Cholesterol in HEK 293 Cell Membrane Fractions—HEK 293 cells were cultured in 60-mm poly-d-lysine-coated plates until they were at or close to 100% confluence. Cells were then treated for 30 min at 37 °C with either 10 mm MβCD or 1–10 mm MβCD-cholesterol in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics or left untreated. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then washed with cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Cells were harvested by scraping in 300 μl of lysis buffer, incubated for 10 min on ice, and lysed by syringe extrusion (20 times through a 25½ gauge needle). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the nuclear fraction and cell debris. The supernatant (membrane fraction) was collected and stored. Protein content in the membrane fraction was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay based on the Bradford"
https://openalex.org/W2011318882,"Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is associated with overactive PDGF receptor signal transduction. We show that the phytoalexin resveratrol dose dependently inhibits PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells with an IC(50) of 10 microM without inducing apoptosis. Remarkably, the increased SIRT1 deacetylase activity induced by resveratrol was not necessary for this inhibitory effect. Resveratrol significantly blocked PDGF-stimulated c-Src and Akt kinase activation, resulting in reduced cyclin D1 expression and attenuated pRb phosphorylation and cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) activity. Furthermore, resveratrol inhibited PDGFR phosphorylation at the PI 3 kinase and Grb-2 binding sites tyrosine-751 and tyrosine-716, respectively. This deficiency in PDGFR phosphorylation resulted in significant inhibition of PI 3 kinase and Erk1/2 MAPK activity. Interestingly, resveratrol increased the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, which dephosphorylates PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation at tyrosine-751 and tyrosine-716 on PDGFR with concomitant reduction in Akt and Erk1/2 kinase activity. PTP1B significantly inhibited PDGF-induced DNA synthesis without inducing apoptosis. These results for the first time provide evidence that the stilbene resveratrol targets PTP1B to inhibit PDGFR mitogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2022195500,"Synaptic plasticity underlies the adaptability of the mammalian brain, but has been difficult to study in living animals. Here we imaged the synapses between pre- and postganglionic neurons in the mouse submandibular ganglion in vivo, focusing on the mechanisms that maintain and regulate neurotransmitter receptor density at postsynaptic sites. Normally, synaptic receptor densities were maintained by rapid exchange of receptors with nonsynaptic regions (over minutes) and by continual turnover of cell surface receptors (over hours). However, after ganglion cell axons were crushed, synaptic receptors showed greater lateral mobility and there was a precipitous decline in insertion. These changes led to near-complete loss of synaptic receptors and synaptic depression. Disappearance of postsynaptic spines and presynaptic terminals followed this acute synaptic depression. Therefore, neurotransmitter receptor dynamism associated with rapid changes in synaptic efficacy precedes long-lasting structural changes in synaptic connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1982442831,"Activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3) is one of nine mammalian proteins containing one or more G-protein regulatory (GPR) motifs that stabilize the GDP-bound conformation of Galphai. Such proteins have revealed unexpected functional diversity for the ""G-switch"" in the control of events within the cell independent of the role of heterotrimeric G-proteins as transducers for G-protein-coupled receptors at the cell surface. A key question regarding this class of proteins is what controls their subcellular positioning and interaction with G-proteins. We conducted a series of yeast two-hybrid screens to identify proteins interacting with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) of AGS3, which plays an important role in subcellular positioning of the protein. We report the identification of Frmpd1 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 1) as a regulatory binding partner of AGS3. Frmpd1 binds to the TPR domain of AGS3 and coimmunoprecipitates with AGS3 from cell lysates. Cell fractionation indicated that Frmpd1 stabilizes AGS3 in a membrane fraction. Upon cotransfection of COS7 cells with Frmpd1-GFP and AGS3-mRFP, AGS3-mRFP is observed in regions of the cell cortex and also in membrane extensions or processes where it appears to be colocalized with Frmpd1-GFP based upon the merged fluorescent signals. Frmpd1 knockdown (siRNA) in Cath.a-differentiated neuronal cells decreased the level of endogenous AGS3 in membrane fractions by approximately 50% and enhanced the alpha2-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced increases in cAMP. The coimmunoprecipitation of Frmpd1 with AGS3 is lost as the amount of Galphai3 in the cell is increased and AGS3 apparently switches its binding partner from Frmpd1 to Galphai3 indicating that the interaction of AGS3 with Frmpd1 and Galphai3 is mutually exclusive. Mechanistically, Frmpd1 may position AGS3 in a membrane environment where it then interacts with Galphai in a regulated manner."

https://openalex.org/W2066538266,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene regulates extracellular matrix deposition. In VHL negative renal cancer cells, VHL(-), the lack of fibronectin matrix assembly is thought to promote and maintain tumor angiogenesis allowing vessels to infiltrate tumors. Therefore, and considering the importance of this process in tumor growth, we aimed to study why VHL(-) renal cancer cells fail to form a proper extracellular matrix. Our results showed that VHL(-) cells were not defective in fibronectin production and that the fibronectin produced by these cells was equally functional in promoting cell adhesion and matrix assembly as that produced by VHL+ cells. We have previously reported that VHL(-) cells fail to form beta1 integrin fibrillar adhesions and have a diminished organization of actin stress fibers; therefore, we aimed to study if the small GTPase family is involved in this process. We found that activation of the RhoA GTPase was defective in VHL(-) cells, and this was possibly mediated by an increased activation of its inhibitor, p190RhoGAP. Additionally, the expression of constitutively active RhoA in VHL(-) cells resulted in formation of a fibronectin matrix. These results strongly suggest an important role for RhoA in some of the defects observed in renal cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1987967088,"The olfactory receptor (OR) multigene family is responsible for the sense of smell in vertebrate species. OR genes are scattered widely in our chromosomes and constitute one of the largest gene families in eutherian genomes. Some previous studies revealed that eutherian OR genes diverged mainly during early mammalian evolution. However, the exact period when, and the ecological reason why eutherian ORs strongly diverged has remained unclear. In this study, I performed a strict data mining effort for marsupial opossum OR sequences and bootstrap analyses to estimate the periods of chromosomal migrations and gene duplications of OR genes during tetrapod evolution. The results indicate that chromosomal migrations occurred mainly during early vertebrate evolution before the monotreme-placental split, and that gene duplications occurred mainly during early mammalian evolution between the bird-mammal split and marsupial-placental split, coinciding with the reduction of opsin genes in primitive mammals. It could be thought that the previous chromosomal dispersal allowed the OR genes to subsequently expand easily, and the nocturnal adaptation of early mammals might have triggered the OR gene expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2073355125,"The molecular action of Alexa 594-labeled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli was examined on living peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 mice by total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM), and the molecular kinetics of LPS was analyzed. TIRFM visualization of the action of fluorescence-labeled LPS revealed an increase in the mean fluorescence intensity of LPS on the plasma membrane of wild type macrophages at 60 min after administration, indicating the oligomerization of LPS after binding to the macrophages. Additionally, a time-dependent sharp decrease in the mean diffusion coefficient of LPS was observed. On the other hand, both mean fluorescence intensity and diffusion coefficient of LPS in cases of TLR4–/–, MD2–/–, MyD88–/–, and TRIF–/– macrophages were significantly different from the corresponding values of wild type macrophage, whereas differences were also noticed among these molecule-deficient macrophages. Furthermore, statistical analysis indicated the major role of receptors (TLR4 and MD2) and intracellular signaling molecules (MyD88 and TRIF) in oligomerization and lowering of the diffusion rate of LPS on the plasma membrane of murine macrophages, respectively. The molecular action of Alexa 594-labeled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli was examined on living peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 mice by total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM), and the molecular kinetics of LPS was analyzed. TIRFM visualization of the action of fluorescence-labeled LPS revealed an increase in the mean fluorescence intensity of LPS on the plasma membrane of wild type macrophages at 60 min after administration, indicating the oligomerization of LPS after binding to the macrophages. Additionally, a time-dependent sharp decrease in the mean diffusion coefficient of LPS was observed. On the other hand, both mean fluorescence intensity and diffusion coefficient of LPS in cases of TLR4–/–, MD2–/–, MyD88–/–, and TRIF–/– macrophages were significantly different from the corresponding values of wild type macrophage, whereas differences were also noticed among these molecule-deficient macrophages. Furthermore, statistical analysis indicated the major role of receptors (TLR4 and MD2) and intracellular signaling molecules (MyD88 and TRIF) in oligomerization and lowering of the diffusion rate of LPS on the plasma membrane of murine macrophages, respectively.

The complex of LPS and LPS-binding protein (LBP) interacts with CD14, a receptor on macrophages/monocytes and neutrophils. Membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked molecule anchored on the cell surface, but it can also remain in the circulation as soluble CD14 (1Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). The revelation of importance of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) for the initiation of the intracellular signaling pathways provided insight into the LPS signaling cascade (2Van Amersfoort E.S.

TLR4 is known to require the coexpression of MD2 in the optimal recognition of LPS (1Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar, 2Van Amersfoort E.S. Van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 379-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). According to the available reports, TLR4-mediated response to LPS can be divided into two different cascades: an early MyD88-dependent response through TLR4 and a delayed MyD88-independent response (3Palsson-Mcdermott E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Immunology. 2004; 113: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 4Sato S. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Tomizawa H. Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The early MyD88-dependent response induces an early activation of NF-κB, IRF3, and IFN-β (3Palsson-Mcdermott E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Immunology. 2004; 113: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the delayed MyD88-independent signaling pathway, TRIF has been established as a key adaptor molecule that is responsible for the later activation of NF-κB, IRF3, and is a more potent inducer of IFN-β compared with MyD88 (3Palsson-Mcdermott E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Immunology. 2004; 113: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Although a few studies have alluded to the direct association of LPS with the TLR4-MD2 complex (5Kobayashi M. Saitoh S.I. Tanimura N. Takahashi K. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Fujimoto Y. Fukase K. Akashi-Takamura S. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 6211-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Visintin A. Halmen K.A. Khan N. Monks B.G. Golenbock D.T. Lien E. J.

J. 2004; 381: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the molecular action of LPS on the plasma membrane of living cells is yet to be fully clarified. Reports describing the involvement of LPS signaling molecules in the dynamics of LPS molecule on the living cell surface by direct visualization are lacking. The elucidation of the molecular mechanism of the recognition of LPS by the TLR4-MD2 complex may contribute to the development of the intervention against LPS-induced inflammation. TIRFM is an ideal means to study the molecular dynamics of biological interaction of cellular molecules in vitro. When an excitation light beam passes across a solid (e.g. glass coverslip or tissue culture plastic) incident at a high angle, greater than the critical angle of total internal reflection upon the solid/liquid surface at which the sample adheres, a thin layer of illumination is produced that is called “evanescent field.” This is the unique feature of TIRFM that enables excitation of the fluorophores near the portion of the plasma membrane adhered to coverslip while avoiding excitation of a much larger number of fluorophores farther out in the liquid. TIRFM typically involves very thin (less than 100 nm) optical sectioning, which means that the signal to noise ratio is much better than with confocal images, and cellular photodamage and photobleaching are also minimal. This is one of the most effective ways to reduce background of fluorescence microscopy to achieve single molecule imaging (8Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 9Toomre D. Manstein D.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Various configurations are possible for TIRFM (8Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The principles and set-up of an “objective type” TIRFM, in which the excitation laser beam illuminates the sample through the objective lens, is shown in Fig. 1 (A–C). Although the fluorophores adhered to the glass surface are also excited by the evanescent field of the laser beam, a striking difference can be found in the fluorescent image of the cell membrane and the glass surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1 (D and E), and subtle adjustment of the focus of the objective lens make it possible to observe and analyze the action of fluorescence-labeled molecules pertaining to cell plasma membrane, avoiding the interference of the fluorescence on the glass surface. Funatsu et al. (11Funatsu T. Harada Y. Tokunaga M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Nature. 1995; 374: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) first observed the single fluorescent molecules in aqueous solution using TIRFM. To date the TIRFM technique has been applied for investigations like single molecule detection (12Sako Y. Ichinose J. Morimatsu M. Ohta K. Uyemura T. J. Pharmacol.

We also focused on the respective roles of TLR4/MD2/MyD88/TRIF molecules in dynamics of LPS on the living cell. Reagents and Antibodies—LPS of Escherichia coli, serotype 055:B5, RPMI 1640 medium (with l-glutamine), and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Sigma, and fetal bovine serum was purchased from Invitrogen. Alexa 594-labeled LPS of E. coli, serotype 055:B5, was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Recombinant mouse LBP (rmLBP) was purchased from Cell Sciences (Canton, MA). Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) was purchased from Invitrogen. Sodium pyruvate was purchased from Cambrex. An ELISA kit to detect mouse tumor necrosis factor α was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Preparation of Murine Peritoneal Macrophages—TLR4–/–, MD2–/–, MyD88–/–, and TRIF–/– mice prepared by Dr. Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) were used. CD14–/– mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Wild type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from SLC. All of the mice were of C57BL/6 strain, male, and 6–8 weeks of age. The mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 ml of 4% thioglycollate. After 3 days, the mice were sacrificed, and peritoneal macrophages were harvested using 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 1% sodium pyruvate was added to reduce auto fluorescence of the cells. The cells were spread on an 8-well cover glass chamber (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Nonadherent cells were washed out with HBSS three times just before TIRFM observation. Care of all the animals used in this study was in accordance with our institutional guidelines. Fluorescence Observation on the Plasma Membrane of Cells by TIRFM—For the observation of the fluorescent spot of Alexa 594-labeled LPS on the plasma membrane of mouse peritoneal macrophages, an objective type TIRFM (IX71; Olympus, Japan) was used. The incident light for evanescent illumination was introduced from the objective lens (PlanApo 100×;NA = 1.4) installed on an inverted microscope. For the evanescent wave excitation of the fluorescence image, a 532-nm laser (Coherent Inc.) and a long pass filter (Asahi Spectra Co.) were used. The laser beam was passed through an electromagnetically driven shutter (Hamamatsu Photonics), and fluorescence images were captured with a monochromatic ICCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) combined with an image intensifier (Hamamatsu Photonics). The video images were contrast-enhanced with a digital image processor (AquaCosmos, version 2.6; Hamamatsu Photonics) and were recorded and stored in a computer hard disk. After washing three times with HBSS, the cover glass chamber spread with mice peritoneal macrophages containing 100 μl of HBSS was set on the objective lens. A drop of mineral oil (Olympus) was added to the lens. Then additional an 100 μl of HBSS containing Alexa 594-labeled LPS and rmLBP was put into the well. The final concentrations of Alexa 594-labeled LPS and rmLBP were 20 and 1000 ng/ml, respectively. The cells were then observed by TIRFM with 4000 microwatts of 532-nm laser, and real time fluorescent images were recorded during specified intervals, namely, 5–15, 25–35, and 55–65 min following LPS administration. However, for simplicity, while plotting the graphs, the aforementioned intervals were denoted as 10, 30, and 60 min, after LPS administration, respectively. ELISA—Peritoneal macrophages from 6–8-week-old, male, C57BL/6 strain mice were collected and prepared in the same way as described earlier. The cells were resuspended with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and spread on 48-well plates. Then incubated in 37 °C for 2 h. Non-adherent cells were washed out with phosphate-buffered saline. Then RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added. The cells were stimulated with 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml of Alexa 594-labeled and unlabeled E. coli LPS of same strain and then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was harvested, and tumor necrosis factor α production was analyzed using an ELISA kit. Analysis—All of the images were analyzed using the automatic fluorescent spot analyzer (AquaCosmos, version 2.6; Hamamatsu Photonics). Higher FI and the typical movement of the murine peritoneal macrophages on the plasma membrane distinguished the fluorescence-labeled LPS molecules from the background noise. Controls devoid of LPS facilitated further the proper detection of the LPS molecule. DC was estimated using AquaCosmos software (version 2.6; Hamamatsu Photonics). FI versus DC plots were prepared using Microsoft Excel. Diagrams showing FI versus the number of LPS spots and DC versus the number of LPS spots were prepared using Origin.6 software and Microsoft Excel, respectively. A graph of spots/μm2 of cells versus time was prepared using Microsoft Excel. The number of Alexa 594-labeled LPS spots was counted from the video images of all the studied macrophages, and the number of spots/μm2 area of cells was calculated and then plotted against time. SPSS (version 15.0J; SPSS Japan Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. We analyzed the mean square displacement (MSD) of 100 fluorescence-labeled LPS spots using the following equation.MSD=(x-x0)2+(y-y0)2(Eq. 1) Here, x0 and y0 are the initial coordinates, and x and y are the coordinates at any given time. The data between each group were compared by unpaired t test, and all of the data were considered to be significant at p value <0.01. Immunological Activity of Alexa 594-labeled LPS—We stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages with Alexa 594-labeled LPS and unlabeled LPS of same strain. Our data showed that both fluorescence-labeled and unlabeled LPS triggered almost the same amount of tumor necrosis factor α (Fig. 2). It proves that the fluorescence-labeled LPS that we used in our experiment is immunologically functional. Visualization of the Molecular Dynamics of LPS on the Peritoneal Macrophages of Wild Type Mouse—We first investigated the molecular action of Alexa 594-labeled LPS on the plasma membrane of peritoneal macrophages of 6–8-week-old male C57BL/6 wild type mice. The cells were observed under TIRFM at 4000 microwatts of green laser at 532 nm at different time intervals. The fluorescence as well as the number of LPS spots gradually increased with time after administration of LPS, and accordingly they were easily distinguishable from the background noise (supplemental Movies S1–S3). Fig. 3A shows a typical movement pattern of a fluorescence-labeled single LPS spot on the cell surface, and Fig. 3B demonstrates the gradual decay of FI because of photobleaching a certain period after the initiation of the observation. In the case of the diagram of the MSD of fluorescence-labeled LPS spots versus time (Fig. 3C), when we analyzed MSD of only two Alexa 594-labeled LPS spots against time, our graph showed a linear pattern, but when we calculated the MSD of 100 LPS spots, the graph was not linear. It is likely that an individual LPS spot can move freely on the surface of the cell, when the spots bind with receptors and adaptor molecule diffusion becomes restricted. Fig. 4A shows a time-dependent change of distribution of fluorescence-labeled LPS spots. Compared with 5–15 min after LPS administration, the number of spots in the higher fluorescence range progressively increased at 25–35 and 55–65 min (Fig. 4B) after LPS administration. At 5–15 min the range of FI was 40–70 AU. The range extended up to 75 at 25–35 min along with an apparent decrease in the number of spots with FI levels of ∼60 AU in comparison with the result at 5–15 min after LPS administration, whereas many spots with FI below 55 AU still could be found at 25–35 min. In contrast, at 55–65 min after LPS administration, a striking reduction in the number of spots with FI below 55 AU in addition to a remarkable increase in the number of spots above 70 AU could be found. Compared with the case of 5–15 min after LPS administration, the diagram of number of spots versus FI after 55–65 min of LPS administration (Fig. 4B) showed a more diffused pattern with several distributed peaks, which indicates the formation of larger oligomers at 55–65 min. This change was accompanied by a decrease in the number of spots in the lower fluorescence range and an increase in the number of spots with the lower DC. The statistical analysis of the data at different time intervals confirmed the apparent time-dependent change of both FI and DC (Fig. 5, A and B). The mean FI of 55.73 ± 0.31 AU (n = 520) after 10 min increased to 59.53 ± 0.35 AU (n = 524) after 60 min of LPS administration, whereas the corresponding mean logarithms of DC values expressed in μm2/s were –0.156 ± 0.026 (n = 520) and –0.467 ± 0.036 (n = 524), respectively. It is important to point out here that, Fig. 5A (plotting mean FI) at first glance may give an impression that there was no change in FI up to 30 min. However, although the statistical mean FI was almost the same at 5–15 and 25–35 min, as demonstrated in Fig. 4B, the appearance of spots with FI of 70–75 AU and the apparent reduction of the spots with FI levels of ∼60 AU at 25–35 min compared with the result at 5–15 min show the time-dependent change in FI at 25–35 min. In Fig. 5C the number of fluorescence-labeled LPS spots/μm2 of wild type macrophages showed a gradual increase with time, indicating higher binding of LPS spots with its concerning receptors and adaptor molecules.FIGURE 5Time-dependent changes of molecular dynamics of Alexa 594-labeled LPS on wild type murine peritoneal macrophages.

In our experiments, consistent with the previous reports on the importance of LBP and CD14 in the initiation of cellular response to LPS (18Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S.

Differences in the Molecular Action of LPS in TLR4–/– and MD2–/– Macrophages—Toll-like receptors are a family of pattern recognition receptors of various natural ligands. Among the TLR family, TLR4 is indispensable for LPS-stimulated signal transduction and various proinflammatory cytokines production (1Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar, 21Jeyaseelan S. Young S.K. Fessler M.B. Liu Y. Malcolm K.C. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Worthen G.S. J.

We also observed the differences of movements of LPS molecule in TLR4–/– macrophages (Fig. 7B and supplemental movie S6). Although after 55–65 min of LPS administration, the fluorescence spots ranged in between 40 and 87 AU for wild type macrophage, spots were not found beyond 60 AU for TLR4–/– macrophage (Fig. 7B). In fact the mean FI of LPS at 60 min for TLR4–/– macrophages was the lowest among all the studied deficient macrophages (18% lower than wild type), suggesting the indispensability of TLR4 for the formation of oligomers of LPS on the plasma membrane (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, as seen in Fig. 8B, the mean logarithm of DC of LPS expressed in μm2/s after 60 min in TLR4–/– macrophages was higher (–0.283 ± 0.031, n = 498) than that of the wild type macrophages (–0.467 ± 0.03, n = 524). In Fig. 9 the number of fluorescence-labeled LPS spots/μm2 for TLR4–/– macrophage was only three at 60 min of LPS administration, whereas in wild type macrophages the number was 10 spots/μm2 at the same time point. It is likely that binding of fluorescence-labeled LPS spots with its receptors is the lowest in the case of TLR4–/– among all the studied macrophages. Supplemental Movie S6 shows the motion of fluorescence-labeled LPS molecules on the plasma membrane of TLR4–/– macrophage.FIGURE 8Comparison of time course changes of mean FI and DC of fluorescence-labeled LPS spots on the peritoneal macrophages of wild type and other signaling molecule-deficient macrophages.

In our study, as seen in TLR4–/– macrophages, a narrower range of FI of LPS spots (40–69 AU) in comparison with the case of wild type (40–87 AU) was also observed in the case of MD2–/– macrophages (Fig. 7C). Among all the studied deficient macrophages, the mean FI of LPS after 60 min in the case of MD2–/– macrophages was the second lowest (50.63 ± 0.27 AU, n = 523) (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, as seen in Fig. 8B, the mean logarithm of DC of LPS expressed in μm2/s at 60 min in MD2–/– macrophages (–0.231 ± 0.031, n = 523) was slightly higher than that of TLR4–/– macrophages. Supplemental Movie S7 shows the motion of fluorescence-labeled LPS molecules on the plasma membrane of MD2–/– macrophage. Molecular Action of LPS in MyD88–/– and TRIF–/– Macrophages—A broader range of FI (up to 76 AU) as well as DC of LPS spots in comparison with the cases of LPS receptors (TLR4, MD2) was observed in absence of MyD88 (Fig. 7D). As compared with the wild type macrophage, the specific pattern of the diagram of number of spots versus fluorescence intensity of LPS in MyD88–/– macrophages indicated formation of smaller oligomers. The mean FI of LPS after 60 min was 52.46 ± 0.33 AU (n = 535), the second highest value observed for all the deficient macrophages (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, the mean logarithm of DC of LPS expressed in μm2/s in the case of MyD88–/– macrophages showed the highest value (–0.113 ± 0.033, n = 535), which was 76% higher than the mean value in wild type (Fig. 8B). It is known that LPS signaling consists of both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. MyD88-dependent signaling is essential for the production of inflammatory cytokines (25Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5688-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 26Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J.I. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). In our study, the importance of MyD88 was manifested by a higher diffusion rate of LPS on the cell surface in the case of MyD88–/– macrophages. Supplemental Movie S8 shows the motion of LPS molecules on the plasma membrane of MyD88–/– macrophage. We further examined the dynamics of LPS molecules on the plasma membranes of peritoneal macrophages of TRIF–/– mouse (supplemental Movie S9). TRIF is responsible for MyD88-independent signaling, which is important for the maturation of dendritic cells and induction of IFN-inducible genes (25Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5688-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 26Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J.I. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The diagram of the number of spots versus fluorescence intensity at 55–65 min showed a moderate range (wider than the diagram of TLR4–/– and MD2–/– but narrower than that of wild type) of fluorescence intensities (ranging up to 81 AU). Fewer peaks of higher FI in the same diagram indicated the lower extent of oligomerization than in the case of wild type macrophage (Fig. 7E). Fig. 8A further shows the difference in the values of mean fluorescence intensity in the case of wild type (59.53 ± 0.35 AU, n = 524) and TRIF–/– macrophages (53.40 ± 0.31 AU, n = 540). On the other hand, in contrast to a sharp decrease of DC in the course of time in the case of wild type macrophage, the mean DC of LPS in the case of TRIF–/– macrophages remained virtually unchanged with time. When compared with the macrophages deficient in LPS receptors (TLR4 and MD2), the mean logarithm of DC of LPS expres"
