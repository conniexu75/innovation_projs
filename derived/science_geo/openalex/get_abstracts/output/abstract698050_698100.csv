Nicotine is also aversive at high doses; yet, our knowledge about nicotine’s dose-dependent effects on DA circuits remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that high doses of nicotine, which induce aversion-related behavior in mice, cause biphasic inhibitory and excitatory responses in VTA DA neurons that can be dissociated by distinct projections to lateral and medial nucleus accumben subregions, respectively. Guided by computational modeling, we performed a pharmacological investigation to establish that inhibitory effects of aversive nicotine involve desensitization of α4β2 and activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We identify α7-dependent activation of upstream GABA neurons in the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) as a key regulator of heterogeneous DA release following aversive nicotine. Finally, inhibition of LDT GABA terminals in VTA prevents nicotine aversion. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic circuit-level understanding of nicotine’s dose-dependent effects on reward and aversion.

https://openalex.org/W4289638004,"In nature, plants interact with a wide range of microorganisms, and most of these microorganisms could induce growth through the activation of important molecular pathways. The current study evaluated whether the endophytic bacterium Bacillus aryabhattai encourages plant growth and the transcriptional changes that might be implicated in this effect. The endophytic bacterium promotes the growth of Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. The transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis plants treated with the bacterium were also identified, and the results showed that various genes, such as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, apyrase, thioredoxin H8, benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, indoleacetaldoxime dehydratase, berberine bridge enzyme-like and gibberellin-regulated protein, were highly expressed. Also, endophytic bacterial genes, such as arginine decarboxylase, D-hydantoinase, ATP synthase gamma chain and 2-hydroxyhexa-2,4-dienoate hydratase, were activated during the interaction. These findings demonstrate that the expression of novel plant growth-related genes is induced by interaction with the endophytic bacterium B . aryabhattai and that these changes may promote plant growth in sustainable agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W4289638436,"Sarcopenia, a relatively new syndrome referring to the age-related decline of muscle strength and degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, often resulting in frailty, disability, and mortality. Osteoarthritis, as a prevalent joint degenerative disease, is affecting over 250 million patients worldwide, and it is the fifth leading cause of disability. Despite the high prevalence of osteoarthritis, there are still lack of efficient treatment potions in clinics, partially due to the heterogeneous and complexity of osteoarthritis pathology. Previous studies revealed the association between sarcopenia and osteoarthritis, but the conclusions remain controversial and the prevalence of sarcopenia within osteoarthritis patients still needs to be elucidated. To identify the current evidence on the prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with osteoarthritis across studies, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis that would help us to further confirm the association between these two diseases.Electronic sources including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science will be searched systematically following appropriate strategies to identify relevant studies from inception up to 28 February 2022 with no language restriction. Two investigators will evaluate the preselected studies independently for inclusion, data extraction and quality assessment using a standardized protocol. Meta-analysis will be performed to pool the estimated effect using studies assessing an association between sarcopenia and osteoarthritis. Subgroup analyses will also be performed when data are sufficient. Heterogeneity and publication bias of included studies will be investigated.CRD42020155694."
https://openalex.org/W4289638010,"Ovarian cancer is usually detected at later stages and no effective screening approach, has been identified. Therefore, sensitive and specific biomarkers for detecting ovarian cancer are urgently needed.This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of six biomarkers for the early clinical diagnosis of ovarian cancer.The study included 120 patients (benign ovarian tumors and early and late ovarian carcinoma) and 30 control healthy volunteers. MiRNA-204, CA125, CA19.9, hepcidin, microfibril-associated glycoprotein 2, and ferroportin levels were determined in all patients and control volunteers.The combined area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for miRNA-204, CA125, and CA19.9 were 0.938, 1.000, and 0.998 for benign tumors and early and late ovarian carcinomas, respectively. The sensitivities of miRNA-204, CA125, and CA19.9 were 98.04%, 100.00%, and 96.19% and the specificities were 58.33%, 62.50%, and 57.78%, respectively.The positive predictivity of miRNA-204, CA125, and CA19.9 for ovarian cancer is high (59.57%, 58.24%, and 61.67%, respectively). Thus, the combination of these three biomarkers is a good diagnostic tool for ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4289637608,"We found evidence from two experiments that a simple set of gestural techniques can improve the experience of online meetings. Video conferencing technology has practical benefits, but psychological costs. It has allowed industry, education and social interactions to continue in some form during the covid-19 lockdowns. But it has left many users feeling fatigued and socially isolated, perhaps because the limitations of video conferencing disrupt users' ability to coordinate interactions and foster social affiliation. Video Meeting Signals (VMS™) is a simple technique that uses gestures to overcome some of these limitations. First, we carried out a randomised controlled trial with over 100 students, in which half underwent a short training session in VMS. All participants rated their subjective experience of two weekly seminars, and transcripts were objectively coded for the valence of language used. Compared to controls, students with VMS training rated their personal experience, their feelings toward their seminar group, and their perceived learning outcomes as significantly higher. Also, they were more likely to use positive language and less likely to use negative language. A second, larger experiment replicated the first, and added a condition where groups were given a version of the VMS training but taught to use emoji response buttons rather than gestures to signal the same information. The emoji-trained groups did not experience the same improvement as the VMS groups. By exploiting the specific benefits of gestural communication, VMS has great potential to overcome the psychological problems of group video meetings."
https://openalex.org/W4289638106,"Background Proper implementation of interventions by health professionals has a critical effect on their effectiveness and the quality of care provided, especially in the case of vulnerable pregnant women. It is important, therefore, to assess the implementation of interventions in care settings to serve as input to improve implementation. Objective The aim of this study is to identify factors that influence the implementation of interventions for vulnerable pregnant women in the North of the Netherlands from the perspective of health professionals. In this region, an intergenerational transfer of poverty is apparent, leading to many health problems and the transfer of unhealthy lifestyles and the associated diseases to subsequent generations. Methods We used a qualitative research design. Semi-structured interviews with 39 health professionals were conducted between February 2019 and April 2020. To analyse the findings, the MIDI (Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations) was used, an instrument designed to identify what determinants influence the actual use of a new or existing innovation. Results We found two themes that influence the implementation of interventions: 1. The attitude of health professionals towards vulnerable pregnant women: stereotyped remarks and words expressing the homogenization of vulnerable pregnant women. 2. A theme related to the MIDI determinants, under which we added six determinants. Conclusion Our research showed that many factors influence the implementation of interventions for vulnerable pregnant women, making the optimal implementation of interventions very complex. We highlight the need to challenge stereotypical views and attitudes towards specific groups in order to provide relation-centred care, which is extremely important to provide culturally appropriate care. Health professionals need to reflect on their own significant influence on access to and the use of care by vulnerable groups. They hold the key to creating partnerships with women to obtain the best health for mothers and their babies."
https://openalex.org/W4289638432,"Implicit math = male stereotypes have been found in early childhood and are linked to girls’ disproportionate disengagement from math-related activities and later careers. Yet, little is known about how malleable children’s automatic stereotypes are, especially in response to brief interventions. In a sample of 336 six- to eleven-year-olds, we experimentally tested whether exposure to a brief story vignette intervention with either stereotypical, neutral, or counter-stereotypical content (three conditions: math = boy vs. neutral vs. math = girl) could change implicit math-gender stereotypes. Results suggested that children’s implicit math = male stereotypes were indeed responsive to brief stories that either reinforced or countered the widespread math = male stereotype. Children exposed to the counter-stereotypical stories showed significantly lower (and non-significant) stereotypes compared to children exposed to the stereotypical stories. Critically, exposure to stories that perpetuated math = male stereotypes significantly increased math-gender stereotypes over and above baseline, underscoring that implicit gender biases that are readily formed during this period in childhood and even brief exposure to stereotypical content can strengthen them. As a secondary question, we also examined whether changes in stereotypes might also lead to changes in implicit math self-concept. Evidence for effects on implicit self-concept were not statistically significant."

This study identified the predictors of quality of life in older adults living alone based on mental health and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Methods This secondary data analysis used information from the 2018 Assessing the Requirements of Customized Health Care and Daily Living Support Services survey (N = 1,022), collected from adults aged ≥ 65 living alone in Siheung City, South Korea, from August to October 2018. The exogenous variables were body functions (hand grip strength, timed “up and go” test score, and body mass index), daily living activities (Korean Instrumental Activities of the Daily Living Scale), social activity participation (social activity engagement, neighbor contacts, and family contacts), and participation in economic activity (frequency). The endogenous variables were mental health (Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form—Korean Version and UCLA Loneliness Scale) and quality of life (EuroQoL-5 Dimension-3 Level and EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale). Results After modifying the hypothetical model, which had failed to satisfy the recommended fitness level, the (modified) model had good fitness indices Q (CMIN / df) 2.90, GFI 1, AGFI 1, RMSEA 0.04, CFI 0.90 and PCFI 0.53. Of the nine pathways of the modified model, five were statistically significant. Quality of life was affected by body functions, daily living activities, social activity participation, and mental health. These variables explained 68.2% of the factors affecting quality of life. Conclusions By highlighting the role of mental health, this model provides a useful framework for improving the quality of life of older adults who live alone and function at various levels in the community. Focusing on advancing mental health through body functions, daily living activities, and social activity participation can improve quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4289637505,"Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. However, sufloxaflor (SFX) is thought to act in a different manner and is thus proposed as an alternative in crop protection. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of SFX and its sublethal effect on the honeybee Apis mellifera after acute exposure. In toxicological assay studies, the LD50 value and sublethal dose (corresponding to the NOEL: no observed effect level) were 96 and 15 ng/bee, respectively. Using the proboscis extension response paradigm, we found that an SFX dose of 15 ng/bee significantly impairs learning and memory retrieval when applied 12 h before conditioning or 24 h after olfactory conditioning. SFX had no effect on honeybee olfactory performance when exposure happened after the conditioning. Relative quantitative PCR experiments performed on the six nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits demonstrated that they are differently expressed in the honeybee brain after SFX exposure, whether before or after conditioning. We found that intoxicated bees with learning defects showed a strong expression of the Amelβ1 subunit. They displayed overexpression of Amelα9 and Amelβ2, and down-regulation of Amelα1, Amelα3 and Amelα7 subunits. These results demonstrated for the first time that a sublethal dose of SFX could affect honeybee learning and memory performance and modulate the expression of specific nAChR subunits in the brain."

However, there is limited surveillance data on the epidemiological burden of respiratory pathogens in tropical countries like Malaysia. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of respiratory pathogens causing ARIs among children aged <18 years old in Malaysia and their epidemiological characteristics.Nasopharyngeal swab specimens received at 12 laboratories located in different states of Malaysia from 2015-2019 were studied. Detection of 18 respiratory pathogens were performed using multiplex PCR.Data from a total of 23,306 paediatric patients who presented with ARI over a five-year period was studied. Of these, 18538 (79.5%) were tested positive. The most prevalent respiratory pathogens detected in this study were enterovirus/ rhinovirus (6837/ 23000; 29.7%), influenza virus (5176/ 23000; 22.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3652/ 23000; 15.9%). Throughout the study period, RSV demonstrated the most pronounce seasonality; peak infection occurred during July to September. Whereas the influenza virus was detected year-round in Malaysia. No seasonal variation was noted in other respiratory pathogens. The risk of RSV hospitalisation was found to be significantly higher in children aged less than two years old, whereas hospitalisation rates for the influenza virus peaked at children aged between 3-6 years old.This study provides insight into the epidemiology and the seasonality of the causative pathogens of ARI among the paediatric population in Malaysia. Knowledge of seasonal respiratory pathogens epidemiological dynamics will facilitate the identification of a target window for vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4289638045,"Experimental research on argument structure has reported mixed results regarding the processing of unaccusative and unergative predicates. Using eye tracking in the visual world paradigm, this study seeks to fill a gap in the literature by presenting new evidence of the processing distinction between agent and theme subjects. We considered two hypotheses. First, the Unaccusative Hypothesis states that unaccusative (theme) subjects involve a more complex syntactic representation than unergative (agent) subjects. It predicts a delayed reactivation of unaccusative subjects compared to unergatives after the presentation of the verb. Second, the Agent First Hypothesis states that the first ambiguous NP of a sentence will preferably be interpreted as an agent due to an attentional preference to agents over themes. It predicts a larger reactivation of agent subjects than themes. We monitored the time course of gaze fixations of 44 native speakers across a visual display while processing sentences with unaccusative, unergative and transitive verbs. One of the pictures in the visual display was semantically related to the sentential subject. We analyzed fixation patterns in three different time frames: the verb frame, the post-verb frame, and the global post-verbal frame. Results indicated that sentential subjects across the three conditions were significantly activated when participants heard the verb; this is compatible with observing a post-verbal reactivation effect. Time course and magnitude of the gaze-fixation patterns are fully compatible with the predictions made by the Agent First Hypothesis. Thus, we report new evidence for (a) a processing distinction between unaccusative and unergative predicates in sentence comprehension, and (b) an attentional preference towards agents over themes, reflected by a larger reactivation effect in agent subjects."
https://openalex.org/W4289638362,"This study examines the role of knowledge creation, knowledge sharing and information communication technologies, which are organizational factors that influence the quality of healthcare services. In today’s knowledge-intensive environment, understanding and gaining in-depth knowledge on how to improve the quality of healthcare services is gaining in importance and recognition. Quantitative data collected in 2019 with 151 respondents employed in healthcare organizations was used. Running a series of hierarchical linear regression models, we found a significant positive relationship between knowledge creation and quality of healthcare services, and a significant positive relationship between knowledge sharing and quality of healthcare services. Empirical data additionally provides support for information communication technologies that act as a moderator both in the relationship between knowledge creation and knowledge sharing with quality of healthcare services. With our data, we provide empirical backing for the impact of knowledge creation, knowledge sharing and information communication technologies on the quality of healthcare services that are provided by Montenegrin healthcare organizations. Our paper offers theoretical and practical implications derived from our research study."
https://openalex.org/W4289637448,"Objectives This questionnaire-based validation study investigated if the dental examination of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder is viewed by dentists with key expertise in paediatric dentistry as a challenge or a threat in terms of transactional stress theory. The Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM) was used for this purpose and it‘s feasibility and validity was examined as a first part of a multi-stage process for validation in dentistry with a sample of German dentists. It has hardly been investigated how the treatment of children and adolescents with a disorder from the autism spectrum is perceived by dentists. Methods An online-based survey (39 questions) plus the SAM as an add-on as well as a preceding short story of imagination on the topic (appointment for a dental check-up in a special school) were developed. Via e-mail members of the German Society of Paediatric Dentistry (DGKiZ) received a link which enabled interested members to participate. The majority of the members of the DGKiZ have additional qualifications in the treatment of children and adolescents and further training in the area of special needs care in dentistry. The data analysis was based on the SAM and its subscales. Results Out of the 1.725 members of DGKiZ 92 participants (11 male, 81 female) fully completed the questionnaire and the SAM. All in all the dentists rated their own psychological and physical stress in course of treating children and adolescents with a disorder from the autism spectrum between less and partly stressful. Although the structure of the SAM could not be fully mapped by means of a factor analysis, the different ratings ""challenge"" or ""threat"" could be comprehensibly evaluated after reading the story. The participants rated the situation from the story in general as challenging but not as threatening. Intercorrelations between the subscales of the SAM (e.g threat and centrality) of r = .56 showed that the scales are not clearly independent of one another. According to the transactional stress model, the SAM bases on, stress (perceived stressfulness) arises from appraisal processes (e.g. threat, controllable-by-self) that bring about a comparison between the requirements for the described situation and one’s own possibilities in terms of a person-environment-fit. In the hierarchical regression a variance of R 2 = .48 could be explained with all six subscales (appraisal processes) to predict perceived stressfulness of the SAM within a sample of dentists. Conclusions Due to the response rate the results of the SAM are not representative for all German dentists, but it offers an insight into topics of special needs dentistry in Germany that have not yet been examined. Overall, the feasibility and validity of the SAM in the context of mapping cognitive appraisal processes and stress could be confirmed. Taking into account the result that the treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder is seen as a challenge, it is concluded that there is a need to improve the education of dental students and graduated dentists in Germany in the field of special needs dentistry."
https://openalex.org/W4289637471,"Laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive technique to treat abdominal conditions, has been shown to produce equivalent safety and efficacy with quicker return to normal function compared to open surgery. As such, it is widely accepted as a cost-effective alternative to open surgery for many abdominal conditions. However, access to laparoscopic surgery in rural North-East India is limited, in part due to limited equipment, unreliable supplies of CO2 gas, lack of surgical expertise and a shortage of anaesthetists. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of gasless laparoscopy as a means to increase provision of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for abdominal conditions in rural North-East India. A decision tree model was developed to compare costs, evaluated from a patient perspective, and health outcomes, disability adjusted life years (DALYs), associated with gasless laparoscopy, conventional laparoscopy or open abdominal surgery in rural North-East India. Results indicate that MIS (performed by conventional or gasless laparoscopy) is less costly and produces better outcomes, fewer DALYs, than open surgery. These results were consistent even when gasless laparoscopy was analysed using least favourable data from the literature. Scaling up provision of MIS through increased access to gasless laparoscopy would reduce the cost burden to patients and increase DALYs averted. Based on a sample of 12 facilities in the North-East region, if scale up was achieved so that all essential surgeries amenable to laparoscopic surgery were performed as such (using conventional or gasless laparoscopy), 64% of DALYS related to these surgeries could be averted, equating to an additional 454.8 DALYs averted in these facilities alone. The results indicate that gasless laparoscopy is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to open surgery for abdominal conditions in rural North-East India and provides a possible bridge to the adoption of full laparoscopic services."
https://openalex.org/W4289637499,"Background Refugees are at high risk of alcohol abuse due to experiences in their country of origin, transit camps, and in host countries. Congolese have been the largest group of refugees resettled in the US since 2016 and Babembe represent one of the largest Congolese refugee sub-groups. There is a growing body of literature highlighting substance abuse among refugees resettled in the US, but little is known about Congolese Babembe. This study aimed to explore factors and practices contributing to alcohol abuse among Congolese Babembe refugees. Methods A qualitative research design employing a narrative inquiry approach was used in this study. One focus group discussion was conducted with a semi-structured guide in February 2020.A total of 19 hard-to-reach male refugee participants were recruited through snowball sampling. Audio recordings were translated and transcribed before a thematic content analysis was conducted using Nvivo 10. Results The main themes arose in the focus group analysis. First, the role of war, trauma, and migration in the onset of alcohol abuse in a community that once limited alcohol use to only older men for socialization. Second, refugees viewed alcohol abuse in their community as a result of post- resettlement cultural loss. Third, refugees perceived alcohol as serving a purpose to help cope with stressful conditions in the US and bad news received from loved ones in Africa. Further analysis shows the role of interactions with armed forces and other cultures during war and migration contributed to the adoption of alcohol abuse behavior. Conclusion Findings from this study suggest that factors contributing to alcohol abuse among Congolese Babembe refugees include personal traumatic experiences, loss of cultural identity, and conducive conditions in the host country. Understanding these factors can guide the development of appropriate interventions to prevent alcohol abuse in this vulnerable community. Further research is needed to include Babembe women’s perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W4289637501,"Purpose We describe the rationale for and design of an innovative, nested, tripartite prospective observational cohort study examining whether relative estrogen insufficiency-induced inflammation amplifies HIV-induced inflammation to cause end organ damage and worsen age-related co-morbidities affecting the neuro-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Brain), skeletal (Bone), and cardiovascular (Heart/vessels) organ systems (BBH Study). Methods The BBH parent study is the Multicenter AIDS Cohort/Women’s Interagency HIV Study Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) with participants drawn from the Atlanta MWCCS site. BBH will enroll a single cohort of n = 120 women living with HIV and n = 60 HIV-negative women, equally distributed by menopausal status. The innovative multipart nested study design of BBH, which draws on data collected by the parent study, efficiently leverages resources for maximum research impact and requires extensive oversight and management in addition to careful implementation. The presence of strong infrastructure minimized BBH study disruptions due to changes in the parent study and the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion BBH is poised to provide insight into sex and HIV associations with the neuro-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems despite several major, unexpected challenges."
https://openalex.org/W4289637506,"The management of endometriosis-related infertility is still a challenging issue. Women can be managed with either surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF). The decision is tailored to the patients considering pros and cons of both approaches. Surgery might increase the chances of natural conception and relieve symptoms. IVF may be more effective, but costs are higher and unoperated women face some peculiar additional risks during the procedure and pregnancy. The unavailability of randomized trials comparing the two strategies hampers the possibility to provide precise estimates. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aims at filling this gap. This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial with parallel groups and allocation 1:1. Three Italian Academic Infertility Units will be involved. Main inclusion criteria are infertility for more than one year, age less than 40 years and a sonographic diagnosis of endometriosis (ovarian endometriomas or deep peritoneal lesions). Previous IVF and previous surgery for endometriosis are exclusion criteria. Women will be randomized to either surgery and then natural pregnancy seeking or a standard program of three IVF cycles. The primary aim is the comparison of live birth rate between the two groups (IVF versus surgery) within one year of randomization. The secondary aim is the evaluation of cost-effective profile of the two interventions. The present study can influence the clinical practice of infertility treatment in women with endometriosis. From a public health perspective, information on the more cost-effective clinical management strategy would consent a wiser allocation of resources.

https://openalex.org/W4289637533,"A spatially-resolved understanding of the intensity of a flood hazard is required for accurate predictions of infrastructure reliability and losses in the aftermath. Currently, researchers who wish to predict flood losses or infrastructure reliability following a flood usually rely on computationally intensive hydrodynamic modeling or on flood hazard maps (e.g., the 100-year floodplain) to build a spatially-resolved understanding of the flood’s intensity. However, both have specific limitations. The former requires both subject matter expertise to create the models and significant computation time, while the latter is a static metric that provides no variation among specific events. The objective of this work is to develop an integrated data-driven approach to rapidly predict flood damages using two emerging flood intensity heuristics, namely the Flood Peak Ratio (FPR) and NASA’s Giovanni Flooded Fraction (GFF). This study uses data on flood claims from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to proxy flood damage, along with other well-established flood exposure variables, such as regional slope and population. The approach uses statistical learning methods to generate predictive models at two spatial levels: nationwide and statewide for the entire contiguous United States. A variable importance analysis demonstrates the significance of FPR and GFF data in predicting flood damage. In addition, the model performance at the state-level was higher than the nationwide level analysis, indicating the effectiveness of both FPR and GFF models at the regional level. A data-driven approach to predict flood damage using the FPR and GFF data offer promise considering their relative simplicity, their reliance on publicly accessible data, and their comparatively fast computational speed."
https://openalex.org/W4289637646,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal gynecological malignancy with a five-year survival rate of only 46%. Development of resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy is a common cause of high mortality rates among OC patients. Tumor and transcriptomic heterogeneity are drivers of platinum resistance in OC. Platinum-based chemotherapy enriches for ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) that are chemoresistant and contribute to disease recurrence and relapse. Studies examining the effect of different treatments on subpopulations of HGSOC cell lines are limited. Having previously demonstrated that combined treatment with an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibitor (EZH2i) and a RAC1 GTPase inhibitor (RAC1i) inhibited survival of OCSCs, we investigated EZH2i and RAC1i combination effects on HGSOC heterogeneity using single cell RNA sequencing. We demonstrated that RAC1i reduced expression of stemness and early secretory marker genes, increased expression of an intermediate secretory marker gene and induced inflammatory gene expression. Importantly, RAC1i alone and in combination with EZH2i significantly reduced oxidative phosphorylation and upregulated Sirtuin signaling pathways. Altogether, we demonstrated that combining a RAC1i with an EZH2i promoted differentiation of subpopulations of HGSOC cells, supporting the future development of epigenetic drug combinations as therapeutic approaches in OC."

Eyeglass prescriptions generated using ClickCheckTM and the resulting visual acuity (VA) was compared to SR for accuracy. Inter-rater reliability and agreement were determined using Intra-class correlation and Bland Altman analysis respectively.The 1,079 participants enrolled had a mean (SD) age of 39.02 (17.94) years and 56% were women. Overall, 45.3% of the participants had refractive error greater than ±0.5D. The mean (SD) spherical corrections were -0.66D (1.85) and -0.89D (2.20) in SR and CR respectively. There was high level of agreement between the spherical power measured using SR and CR (ICC: 0.940 (95% CI: 0.933 to 0.947). For the assessment of cylindrical correction, there was moderate level of agreement between SR and CR (ICC: 0.493 (0.100 to 0.715). There was moderate level of agreement between the VA measurements performed by using corrections from SR and CR (ICC: 0.577 (95% CI: 0.521-0.628). The subgroup analysis based on the age categories also showed high level of agreement for spherical corrections between the two approaches (ICC: 0.900). Bland Altman analysis showed good agreement for spherical corrections between SR and CR (Mean difference: 0.224D; 95% LoA: -1.647 D to 2.096 D) without evidence of measurement bias.There was a high level of agreement for spherical power measurement between CR and SR. However, improvements are needed in order to accurately assess the cylindrical power. Being a portable, low-cost and easy-to-use refraction device, ClickCheckTM can be used for first level assessment of refractive errors, thereby enhancing the efficiency of refractive services, especially in low- and-middle-income countries."

The present study explored how shared reading experience influenced predictive brain signals and expressive vocabulary of 12-month-old infants. The predictive brain signals were measured by fNIRS responses in the occipital lobe with an unexpected visual-omission task. The amount of shared reading experience was correlated with the strength of this predictive brain signal and with infants’ expressive vocabulary. Importantly, the predictive brain signal explained unique variance of expressive vocabulary beyond shared reading experience and maternal education. A further mediation analysis showed that the effect of shared reading experience on expressive vocabulary was explained by the infants’ predictive brain signal. This is the first evidence indicating that richer shared reading experience strengthens predictive signals in the infant brain and in turn facilitates expressive vocabulary acquisition."

Of 52 non-secreting macroadenoma patients, 12 had moderate elevation of prolactin secondary to stalk effect. Patients with moderate elevation in prolactin demonstrated increased RNFL thickness compared to patients with normal prolactin levels (p < 0.01). Additionally, a significant positive relation between increasing levels of prolactin and RNFL thickness was identified in patients with moderate prolactin elevation (R = 0.51, p-value = 0.035). No significant difference was identified between prolactinoma patients and those with normal prolactin levels.Moderately increased serum prolactin is associated with increased RNFL thickness when compared to controls. These associations are lost when serum prolactin is < 30 ng/ml or elevated in prolactinomas. This suggests a neuroprotective effect of prolactin at moderately increased levels in preserving retinal function during optic chiasm compression."
https://openalex.org/W4289638233,"An integral part of the courtship sequence of the German cockroach ( Blattella germanica ) involves the male raising his wings to expose tergal glands on his dorsum. When a female cockroach feeds on the secretion of these glands, she is optimally positioned for mating. Core chemical components have been identified, but the effect of male diet on the quality of the tergal gland secretion remains unexplored. After validating the pivotal role of tergal feeding in mating, we starved or fed reproductively mature males for one week. We then paired each male with a sexually receptive female and observed their interactions through an infrared-sensitive camera. While starvation had no effect on male courtship behavior, it did influence the duration of female tergal feeding and mating outcomes. Females fed longer on the gland secretion of fed males, and fed males experienced greater mating success than starved males (73.9% vs. 48.3%, respectively). These results suggest that the quality of the tergal gland secretions, and by association mating success, are dependent on the nutritional condition of the male."
https://openalex.org/W4289638298,"Patient satisfaction is a subjective attitudinal response of a client to a health institution's services and a pillar of quality assurance. Patients who are happy with their treatment are much more likely to stick with it, improve quickly, and function normally. Satisfied patients are more compliant, improve faster, and are more functional. However, there haven't been enough studies conducted across the country, and none have been conducted in this study area. As a result, the purpose of the study was to estimate the size of patient satisfaction and associated determinants at Dilla University Referral Hospital's psychiatry unit in Dilla, 2020.This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study design utilized using a simple random sampling technique. To assess patient satisfaction, we used the 24-item Mental Health Service Satisfaction Scale which was a validated tool in Ethiopia. The link between the outcome and the independent variable was determined using linear regression analysis (P< 0.05).This study enrolled 409 respondents with a response rate of 97%. The overall mean percentage score of patient satisfaction was 55.4% (95% CI (48.4%- 59.2%). Having bipolar disorder diagnosis [β = -2.93, 95% CI (-4.33, -1.96), p = .000], distance from the hospital [β = -2.34), 95% CI (-3.765, -1.735), P = .001], waiting time [β = -2.19, 95% CI (-3.49, -1.10), p = .000], monthly income (2.95, 95% CI (1.65, 5.23) and Urban residence (β = 1.43, 95% CI (1.03-3.43), p = 0.01) were variables significantly associated with perceived patient satisfaction.In this study, more than half of the respondents scored above the mean percentage score of patient satisfaction. The amount of time spent in the waiting area and the distance traveled to the hospital were identified as variables that could be improved by working with different stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W4289638435,"Understanding parents' and children's mental health issues would help design population-specific intervention programs. The present study explored parents' perceived stress and child emotions and behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown among Sri Lankan families.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Sri Lankan parents of children aged 11 to 17 years. Validated instruments (Perceived Stress Scale-PSS and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-SDQ) evaluated parental stress, child emotions, and hyperactivity/inattention. Multiple linear regression assessed the predictors of mental health issues, including the interaction between age and gender.Three hundred fifty-five parents responded to the survey (mothers:76%). One-third of parents experienced difficulties with their children during the pandemic. Emotions and hyperactivity-inattention problems measured via the SDQ scale were high among 38% of children, while the perceived stress was high in 79.2% of parents. Overall, child emotions and hyperactivity-inattention increased with decreasing age, increasing parent stress, having middle-income compared to high-income, and having a family member/close relative tested positive for COVID-19. Hyperactivity-inattention (29.3%) was more than the emotional problems (22%) among children. The emotional problems were reported more with increasing parent stress, while child hyperactivity-inattention alone was reported more with decreasing age, middle-income compared to high-income families, and increasing parent stress. Also, the interaction effect of age and gender indicated that higher age was related to greater parent-reported hyperactivity-inattention problems in males.The findings highlight how the COVID-19 crisis and social isolation have contributed to increased parental stress and child emotional and hyperactivity-inattention problems. In addition to cautioning the healthcare workers, socio-culturally appropriate preventive and supportive mental health programs may help deal with further waves of COVID-19 or any other adverse circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W4289638456,"Existing studies have acknowledged the underutilization of skilled maternal healthcare services among women in rural Nigeria. Consequently, women in rural areas face a disproportionate risk of poor health outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality. Addressing the challenge of non-use of skilled maternal healthcare in rural areas necessitates the involvement of multi-stakeholders across different sectors who have vital roles to play in improving maternal health. This study explores the factors contributing to the non-use of maternal healthcare services in rural areas of Edo, Nigeria from the perspectives of community elders and policymakers.In this qualitative study, data were collected through 10 community conversations (group discussions) with community elders each consisting of 12 to 21 participants, and six key informant interviews with policymakers in rural areas of Edo State, Nigeria. Participants were purposefully selected. Conversations and interviews occurred in English, Pidgin English and the local language; lasted for an average of 9 minutes; were audio-recorded and transcribed to English. Data were manually coded, and data analysis followed the analytical strategies for qualitative description including an iterative process of inductive and deductive approaches.Policymakers and community elders attributed the non-use of maternal health services to poor quality of care. Notions of poor quality of care included shortages in skilled healthcare workers, apathy and abusive behaviours from healthcare providers, lack of life-saving equipment, and lack of safe skilled pregnancy care. Non-use was also attributed to women's complex utilization patterns which involved a combination of different types of healthcare services, including traditional care. Participants also identified affordability and accessibility factors as deterrents to women's use of skilled maternal healthcare.The emerging findings on pregnant women's combined use of different types of care highlight the need to improve the quality, availability, accessibility, and affordability of skilled maternal care for rural women in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4289638458,"Introduction Early childhood experiences have a lifelong impact on a child’s future. Social and environmental experiences and interactions have a profound relational effect on children’s physical and mental health which transfers agency to parents, caregivers and duty-bearers to care for the child’s welfare. In the Australian context early child development indices have been in decline in some communities. Hence, there is a sense of urgency to reverse these trends from an integrated perspective. A multisector, multi component program of interventions named A Good Start in Life is proposed and is being tested in the Australian Capital Territory across suburbs with high levels of early childhood development disadvantage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes and processes related to targeted interventions, designed to integrate child and family services within the local district and embed allied health programs into early childhood education, care services and playgroups. Methods and analysis The Good Start in Life study will use a quasi-experimental design (with a matched control geographical area) consisting of a combination of interventions that will build multisectoral collaboration across education, health and social services that connect and support families with children from birth to 5 years. The control area will be matched on demographic characteristics and early child development outcomes and trends over the pre-intervention period. Evaluation data will be collected at baseline, and then on an annual basis for a further three years. A mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate delivery processes: quantitative (checklists, questionnaires) and qualitative methods (observations, focus groups and key stakeholder interviews). Effectiveness of the programme will be evaluated by comparing early child development outcomes between the comparator areas from the Australian Early Development Census in 2024. The primary focus will be on reducing the number of children who are developmentally vulnerable on at least one early development index (EDI). Separate tests will be conducted for significant differences in the percentage of children at risk in each of the five individual EDI domains. These domains are physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication and general knowledge.

https://openalex.org/W4289638527,"Background Color vision deficiency describes the inability to distinguish certain shades of color. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of having color vision deficiency on the accuracy of distinguishing benign and malignant skin lesions by naked-eye examination. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the period August 2020 to February 2021. We randomly selected a total of 20 nevi and 20 melanoma images from an open access image database. The 40 images were divided into four sets of images, each set contained 5 benign and 5 malignant skin lesion images simulated as if they were seen by a protanope physician, deuteranope physician, tritanope physician, and a set of images presented without simulation. In an online survey, students who were in their final year of medical school or had newly graduated were asked to diagnose each image as benign or malignant. Results A total of 140 participants were included with a mean (SD) age of 24.88 (1.51). We found a significantly higher mean accuracy for non-simulated images compared to deuteranope simulated images (p&lt; 0.001, mean difference = 11.07, 95% CI 8.40 to 13.74). We did not find a significant difference in accuracy classification for protanope simulated images (p = 0.066), nor for tritanope simulated images (p = 0.315). Classification accuracy for malignant lesions was higher than classification accuracy for benign lesions, with the highest difference belonging to deuteranope simulated images, with a difference in mean accuracy of classifying malignant lesions by 32.2 (95% CI 27.0 to 37.6). Conclusion Deuteranope participants (i.e., green color deficiency) had a significantly lower accuracy of distinguishing pigmented skin lesions as benign or malignant, an impact not found for other color vision deficiencies, which was mainly for misdiagnosing benign lesions as malignant."
https://openalex.org/W4289638532,"Background Research on the influences on bike share use and potential favorable relationships between use and obesity is limited, particularly in the U.S. context. Therefore, the aims of this exploratory study were to examine correlates of awareness and use of Boston’s Bluebikes bike share system and assess the association between use and weight status. Methods Students, faculty, and staff (n = 256) at a public urban university completed an online survey that assessed sociodemographic, behavioral, and physical activity characteristics, Bluebikes awareness, and use of Bluebikes and personal bikes. Multivariable logistic regression models were estimated to examine associations between sociodemographic and behavioral factors and bike share awareness and use; and between use and overweight/obesity status. Results Respondents were mostly students (72.2%), female (69.1%), White (62.1%), and the mean age was 32.4±13.8 years. The percentage of respondents classified as aware of Bluebikes was 33.6% with only 12.9% reporting any use of the system. Living in a community where bike share stations were located (odds ratio (OR) = 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10, 3.67), personal bike ownership (OR = 2.27, 95% CI:1.27, 4.45), and not exclusively commuting to campus via car (OR = 3.19, 95% CI:1.63, 6.22) had significant positive associations with awareness. Living in a bike share community (OR = 2.34; 95% CI:1.04, 5.27) and personal bike ownership (OR = 3.09; 95% CI:1.27, 7.52) were positively associated with bike share use. Any reported use of Bluebikes was associated with 60% lower odds of being overweight/obese (OR = 0.40; 95% CI:0.17, 0.93). Conclusions Several environmental and behavioral variables, including access to stations and personal bicycle ownership, were significantly associated with Bluebikes awareness and use. Findings also suggest a potential benefit to bike share users in terms of maintaining a healthy weight, though further longitudinal studies are needed to rule out the possibility that more active and leaner individuals tend to use bike share more frequently."

https://openalex.org/W4283713468,"Despite considerable scholarly attention on the institutional and normative aspects of development cooperation, its longitudinal dynamics unfolding at the global level have rarely been investigated. Focusing on aid, we examine the evolving global structure of development cooperation induced by aid flows in its entirety. Representing annual aid flows between donors and recipients from 1970 to 2013 as a series of networks, we apply hierarchical stochastic block models to extensive aid-flow data that cover not only the aid behavior of the major OECD donors but also that of other emerging donors, including China. Despite a considerable degree of external expansion and internal diversification of aid relations over the years, the analysis has uncovered a temporally persistent structure of aid networks. The latter comprises, on the one hand, a limited number of major donors with far-reaching resources and, on the other hand, a large number of mostly poor but globally well-connected recipients. The results cast doubt on the efficacy of recurrent efforts for ""aid reform"" in substantially changing the global aid flow pattern."
https://openalex.org/W4289637364,"Cattle have a complex social organization, with negative (agonistic) and positive (affiliative) interactions that affect access to environmental resources. Thus, the social behaviour has a major impact on animal production, and it is an important factor to improve the farm animal welfare. The use of data from electronic bins to determine social competition has already been validated; however, the studies used non-free software or did not make the code available. With data from electronic bins is possible to identify when one animal takes the place of another animal, i.e. a replacement occurs, at the feeders or drinkers. However, there is no package for the R environment to detect competitive replacements from electronic bins data. Our general approach consisted in creating a user-friendly R package for social behaviour analysis. The workflow of the socialh package comprises several steps that can be used sequentially or separately, allowing data input from electronic systems, or obtained from the animals' observation. We provide an overview of all functions of the socialh package and demonstrate how this package can be applied using data from electronic feed bins of beef cattle. The socialh package provides support for researchers to determine the social hierarchy of gregarious animals through the synthesis of agonistic interactions (or replacement) in a friendly, versatile, and open-access system, thus contributing to scientific research."
https://openalex.org/W4289637373,"In this paper, an aliasing noise restraint technique and a system identification-based surface electromyography (sEMG)-force prediction model are proposed to realize a type of robust sEMG and muscle force prediction. For signal denoising, a novel non-negative matrix factorization screening empirical mode decomposition (NMFSEMD) and a fast orthogonal search (FOS)-based muscle force prediction model are developed. First, the NMFSEMD model is used to screen the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) results into the noisy intrinsic mode functions (IMF). Then, the noise matrix is computed using IMF translation and superposition, and the matrix is used as the input of NMF to obtain the denoised IMF. Furthermore, the reconstruction outcome of the NMFSEMD method can be used to estimate the denoised sEMG. Finally, a new sEMG muscle force prediction model, which considers a kind of candidate function in derivative form, is constructed, and a data-training-based linear weighted model is obtained. Extensive experimental results validate the suggested method's correction: after the NMFSEMD denoising of raw sEMG signal, the signal-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by about 15.0 dB, and the energy percentage (EP) can be greater than 90.0%. Comparing with the muscle force prediction models using the traditional pretreatment and LSSVM, and the NMFSEMD plus LSSVM-based method, the mean square error (MSE) of our approach can be reduced by at least 1.2%."
https://openalex.org/W4289637418,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the abundance and distribution of psychrophilic microorganisms associated with spoilage in beef slaughterhouse environments after cleaning. The processing lines and equipment used in slaughtering and boning were swabbed, and the microbial count was determined using a TSA and MRS medium and Chromocult ® Coliform agar incubated at 15ºC and 37ºC, respectively. As a result, the brisket saw (handle side) and trolley hook were the most heavily contaminated with microorganisms, with each having a microbial adhesion rate of 66.7%. The microbial adhesion rates of the apron and milling cutter (edge side) were 50%, respectively, and those of the foot cutter (edge and handle side), splitting saw (edge side), and knife (handle side) were 33.3%, respectively. Next, four colonies were randomly isolated from the petri dish used for the bacterial count measurement to identify the predominant microbial species of the microorganisms attached to each equipment. As a result of Sanger sequencing analysis, yeasts such as Candida zeylanoides and Rhodotorula sp. and bacteria including Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp. were identified from the equipment used in the slaughtering line, and it was assumed that these microorganisms were of environmental origin. In contrast, only Pseudomonas sp. and Candida zeylanoides were isolated from the boning line. Despite the use of cleaning operations, this study identified some equipment was contaminated with microorganisms. Since this equipment frequently comes into direct contact with the carcass, it is critical to thoroughly remove the microorganisms through accurate cleaning to prevent the spread of microbial contamination on the carcasses."

We investigated the association between several insulin sensitivity indices (ISIs) and cancer-mortality over 3.5 decades in a cohort of adult men and women. We hypothesized that higher insulin resistance will be associated with greater cancer-mortality risk.A cohort of 1,612 men and women free of diabetes during baseline were followed since 1979 through 2016 according to level of insulin resistance (IR) for cause specific mortality, as part of the Israel study on Glucose Intolerance, Obesity and Hypertension (GOH). IR was defined according to the Mcauley index (MCAi), calculated by fasting insulin and triglycerides, the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), the Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index (MISI), and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), calculated by plasma glucose and insulin.Mean age at baseline was 51.5 ± 8.0 years, 804 (49.9%) were males and 871 (54.0%) had prediabetes. Mean follow-up was 36.7±0.2 years and 47,191 person years were accrued. Cox proportional hazard model and competing risks analysis adjusted for age, sex, country of origin, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking and glycemic status, revealed an increased risk for cancer-mortality, HR = 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p = 0.005) for the MCAi Q1 compared with Q2-4. No statistically significant associations were observed between the other ISIs and cancer-mortality.The MCAi was independently associated with an increased risk for cancer-mortality in adult men and women free of diabetes and should be further studied as an early biomarker for cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W4289637532,"Background Sustained elevated concentration of GHGs is predicted to increase global mortality. With the Australian health sector responsible for 7% of the nation’s GHG emissions, the benefits and costs of various decarbonisation trajectories are currently being investigated. To assist with this effort, we model the impact earlier decarbonisation has on temperature-related mortality. Design We used DICE-EMR, an Integrated Assessment Model with an endogenous mortality response, to simulate Australian GHG trajectories and estimate the temperature-related mortality impact of early decarbonisation. We modelled a linear decline of the Australian health sector’s and economy’s GHG annual emissions to net-zero targets of 2040 and 2050. Main outcome measure Deaths averted and monetary-equivalent welfare gain. Results Decarbonisation of the Australian health sector by 2050 and 2040 is projected to avert an estimated 69,000 and 77,000 global temperature-related deaths respectively in a Baseline global emissions scenario. Australian economy decarbonisation by 2050 and 2040 is projected to avert an estimated 988,000 and 1,101,000 global deaths respectively. Assuming a low discount rate and high global emissions trajectory, we estimate a monetary equivalent welfare gain of $151 billion if the Australian health sector decarbonises by 2040, only accounting for the benefits in reducing temperature-related mortality. Conclusions Earlier decarbonisation has a significant impact on temperature-related mortality. Many uncertainties exist and health impacts other than temperature-related mortality are not captured by this analysis. Nevertheless, such models can help communicate the health risk of climate change and improve climate policy decision making."
https://openalex.org/W4289637595,"Western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, LeConte, is an insect pest that poses a significant threat to the productivity of modern agriculture, causing significant economic and crop losses. The development of genetically modified (GM) crops expressing one or more proteins that confer tolerance to specific insect pests, such as WCR, was a historic breakthrough in agricultural biotechnology and continues to serve as an invaluable tool in pest management. Despite this, evolving resistance to existing insect control proteins expressed in current generation GM crops requires continued identification of new proteins with distinct modes of action while retaining targeted insecticidal efficacy. GM crops expressing insecticidal proteins must undergo extensive safety assessments prior to commercialization to ensure that they pose no increased risk to the health of humans or other animals relative to their non-GM conventional counterparts. As part of these safety evaluations, a weight of evidence approach is utilized to assess the safety of the expressed insecticidal proteins to evaluate any potential risk in the context of dietary exposure. This study describes the food and feed safety assessment of Vpb4Da2, a new Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal protein that confers in planta tolerance to WCR. Vpb4Da2 exhibits structural and functional similarities to other insect control proteins expressed in commercialized GM crops. In addition, the lack of homology to known toxins or allergens, a lack of acute toxicity in mice, inactivation by conditions commonly experienced in the human gut or during cooking/food processing, and the extremely low expected dietary exposure to Vpb4Da2 provide a substantial weight of evidence to demonstrate that the Vpb4Da2 protein poses no indication of a risk to the health of humans or other animals."
https://openalex.org/W4289637604,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading killer of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and almost one-third of deaths in the world are attributed to it and many of these deaths occur in developing countries. Despite these evidences, after the implementation of universal test and treat (UTT) strategy, information regarding the incidence and predictors of tuberculosis among PLHIV is limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of tuberculosis among patients enrolled in Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) after universal test and treat program at St. Peter hospital and Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Institutional-based retrospective cohort study was conducted from November 1 to 30, 2020. Simple random sampling was used to select a total of 539 adults records which was enrolled on ART. Data was collected and entered into EPI DATA 3.1 and analyzed using STATA version 14.1. Time-to-event distributions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Hazards across different categories were compared using log-rank tests. Predictors were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. Variables having P-value < 0.05 from the multivariable analysis were considered as a statistically significant.Among 539 records reviewed, 529 (98%) were included in the final analysis. The total follow-up period was 1529 Person-Year (PY). The incidence rate in this cohort was found to be 4.84 per 100-person year (95%CI,3.83-6.11). CD4 count<200 (AHR: 3.14,95% CI:1.64-7.10), poor adherence (AHR:2.16, 95% CI:1.21-3.85), underweight (AHR:2.42, 95% CI: 1.30-4.51), not taking isoniazid prophylaxis therapy (AHR: 2.78,95% CI: 1.06-7.30), being bedridden 3.06; (AHR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.50-6.24), and baseline WHO stage three or four (AHR:2.33, 95% CI:1.08-5.02) were independent predictors for the incidence of TB among HIV positive patients.In this study, the incidence of tuberculosis is relatively low as compared to studies done before the initiation of test and treat program in Ethiopia. low CD4count, poor level of adherence, low BMI, not taking IPT prophylaxis, bedridden functional status, and being on baseline WHO stage III or IV were found to increase the hazard of tuberculosis. Hence, close follow up, reminders, surveillance, and tracing mechanisms targeting this higher risk group would decrease Tuberculosis among PLHIV."

Children with ADHD are difficult to handle due to the symptoms causing great impairments such as inattention, hyperactivity compared to other childhood mental disorders. Having a child with ADHD is a stressful situation as it impacts the whole family. However, little is known about the experiences and challenges of parents caring for children with ADHD in low and middle-income countries such as Tanzania. Thus, this study explored the experiences and challenges of parents caring for children with ADHD in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods We conducted a qualitative descriptive study involving 16 parents of children with ADHD at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). We used the purposive sampling technique to obtain the participants. In-depth interviews, using a semi-structured interview guide, were used to collect data. Audio-recorded data were transcribed, translated, and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results Parents experienced difficulties in handling the children whose level of functioning was impaired due to abnormal and disruptive behaviour such as not being able to follow parental instructions. Psychological problems were also experienced due to caring demands exacerbated by lack of support and stigma from the community. Moreover, there were disruptions in family functioning and social interactions among family members due to the children’s behaviour. Lastly, too much time and family resources spent to fulfil the needs of these children culminated into disruption in economic activities that negatively affected everyday life. Conclusion Parents struggle to meet and cope with care demands posed by children with ADHD. The disruptive nature of ADHD symptoms presents a unique caring challenge different from those experienced with other childhood mental illnesses. To address these challenges, a collaborative approach among key stakeholders such as the government, health care professionals, and non-governmental organizations, is needed."

While oligodendrocytes have been extensively studied due to their high levels of GALC, the contribution of astrocytes to disease pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two donors with infantile onset Krabbe disease and differentiated them into cultures of astrocytes. Krabbe astrocytes recapitulated many key findings observed in humans and rodent models of the disease, including the accumulation of psychosine and elevated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Unexpectedly, Krabbe astrocytes had higher levels of glucosylceramide and ceramide, and displayed compensatory changes in genes encoding glycosphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting a shunting away from the galactosylceramide and psychosine pathway. In co-culture, Krabbe astrocytes negatively impacted the survival of iPSC-derived human neurons while enhancing survival of iPSC-derived human microglia. Substrate reduction approaches targeting either glucosylceramide synthase or serine palmitoyltransferase to reduce the sphingolipids elevated in Krabbe astrocytes failed to rescue their detrimental impact on neuron survival. Our results suggest that astrocytes may contribute to the progression of Krabbe disease and warrant further exploration into their role as therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W4289637916,"This paper draws on individual-level data from the National Study of Family Growth (NSFG) to identify likely underreporters of abortion and miscarriage and examine their characteristics. The NSFG asks about abortion and miscarriage twice, once in the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) part of the questionnaire and the other in the audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) part. We used two different methods to identify likely underreporters of abortion and miscarriage: direct comparison of answers obtained from CAPI and ACASI and latent class models. The two methods produce very similar results. Although miscarriages are just as prone to underreporting as abortions, characteristics of women underreporting abortion differ somewhat from those misreporting miscarriages. Underreporters of abortions tended to be older, poorer, less likely to be Hispanic or Black, and more likely to have no religion. They also reported more traditional attitudes toward sexual behavior. By contrast, underreporters of miscarriage also tended to be older, poorer, and more likely to be Hispanic or Black, but were also more likely to have children in the household, had fewer pregnancies, and held less traditional attitudes toward marriage."

Methods This was a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed in Google forms and the link was shared through the college WeChat groups. The questionnaire consisted of four parts on socio-demographic, sexual behaviour and contraceptive use, knowledge, and attitude on STIs. All the students under RUB were invited to participate voluntarily in this study. The socio-demography was presented in frequency and proportion. Result A total of 1,283 students participated in this survey and 55.0% (701) were females. Of this, 29.4% (377) were sexually active and 94.4% reported using modern contraception. Commonly used contraceptives were: condoms (83.8%, 316) and emergency contraceptives (20.6%, 78), respectively. The mean knowledge and attitude scores on STI were 9.94 (range 2–20) and 12 (range 2–14), respectively. Good knowledge and attitude on STI were reported in 53.2% (683) and 70.1% (899) of participants. Conclusion Students reported average knowledge and a good attitude towards STI. Contraceptive use among university students was low. There is a need to strengthen health education on STIs in schools and universities. All forms of contraceptives especially condoms should be made easily available to sexually active people."
https://openalex.org/W4289638238,"The purpose of this article is to present the development and validation of a Community Resilience Scale for Youth (CRS-Y) among a Portuguese sample of nearly 4000 young people growing up in regions on the border with Spain. The scale was developed for young people to assess their perception of the resilience of regional communities in terms of positive development and purposeful experiences for young people. Resilient communities, under a social ecological approach, are those able to move forward on social change and transformation. This concept is especially remarkable in more challenging contexts such as border regions of mainland Portugal which are characterised by economic, social, educational, and cultural disadvantages while discovering possibilities of resilience through promising local dynamics. A multi-step approach was used to develop this scale of 12-item scale. Items were generated based on an in-depth literature review and research previously conducted with young people in these contexts. The overall sample was randomly divided into two subsamples of 1828 and 1735 young people each. Principal component analysis was performed with one of the subsamples and yielded a three-factor structure, explaining 61.5% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis performed on the second showed good fit indexes. Furthermore, internal consistency of the three proposed components, gauged either by Cronbach’s alpha or McDonald’s omega, indicated good reliability. Given the results, the CRS-Y is a valid and reliable tool showing adequate psychometric properties. This scale will be useful for schools and policy makers at the local level. Indicators such as the promotion of opportunities to participate and be recognised, collective trust and the promotion of shared values and protection are relevant in assessing regional communities’ resilience and informing youth policies."
https://openalex.org/W4289638343,"Athlete leadership groups (ALGs) are a widely used yet under researched approach to leadership in professional sports teams. Athlete Leadership Groups (ALGs) represent a shared athlete leadership model whereby a small group of players are selected as athlete leaders and appointed to a formal ‘leadership group’ (i.e., an ALG) that shares team leadership responsibilities with the coach. Although athlete leadership has been linked to improved team outcomes, inadequately trained athlete leaders can have a detrimental effect on team functioning and performance. The aim of this study was to provide coach and athlete leader’s perceptions of the development opportunities that have been afforded to players to prepare them for their role in an ALG. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 head coaches and 14 players from leadership groups drawn from 17 teams across four professional football leagues (i.e., Super Rugby, National Rugby League, A League and Australian Football League) in Australia and New Zealand. Results illustrate that athlete leaders benefit from developing enhanced understanding of leadership as a multidimensional relational process, recognising various leadership styles, preferences, and how to leverage their influence with teammates. However, it is evident this theoretical knowledge alone is insufficient to equip players for a professional team ALG role. Players need opportunities to practice their developing leadership skills in authentic and appropriately challenging situations with support and facilitation. Findings point to the importance of systematic, individually tailored leadership development that includes scaffolded, structured experiential learning and meaningful interactions with other successful high-performance leaders. Further, this study reinforces the value of guided reflective practice in leadership development and how this process can enhance learning and transfer from leadership development initiatives. Finally, this study adds weight to calls from other researchers for coaches to be consistently intentional in employing leadership development strategies."

Nature connectedness, or relatedness to natural systems, is associated with increased well-being and mental health. Among urban populations, nature connectedness has been reported as lower. Nature connectedness in urban settings has been somewhat overlooked by researchers. This cross-sectional online study addressed this issue by identifying socio-demographic predictors of urban nature connectedness among 165 students, aged 20 to 40, from the Technical University of Munich. Analysis of the data from 153 female university students was conducted using ordinal regressions, (a) separately and (b) merged with their 12 male counterparts. A separate gender analysis for males could not be performed, due to sample size limitations. Although access to nature and a considerable nature dose in terms of frequency and duration of nature contact were noted, possibly achieved through the engagement in outdoor activities, urban nature connectedness was rather low. Results showed that urban nature connectedness was negatively predicted by living in a rural area and positively predicted by engagement in outdoor activities and increased hours per week spent in nature. This information can help researchers operationalize the construct of urban nature connectedness. Furthermore, it can aid the development of interventions aimed at promoting urban nature connectedness, by encouraging urban inhabitants to (repeatedly) get in contact with and spend time in provided high-quality urban nature (e.g., during outdoor activities). To draw conclusions about causality, further research is required to identify a clear cause-effect relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and urban nature connectedness. Based on a researched dose-response relationship, a(n) (inter)national recommendation for the duration of nature contact should be established to promote urban nature connectedness and, therewith, health in urban inhabitants. Future research should also investigate further potential individual influencing factors, as well as gender and within/between-country differences among urban inhabitants."
https://openalex.org/W4289638375,"This study explores the cultural characteristics of subcontinent students and maps the characteristics to the challenges to their academic success. Interviews of fifty staff from an Australian university indicated that both teaching and professional staff held similar views on the characteristics of subcontinent students. Significant characteristics included respect for teachers, the need for continual guidance, a tendency to group, and a propensity to negotiate. The identified challenges to the academic success of subcontinent students were a lack of engagement with staff, inadequate critical thinking, poor communication skills, academic integrity issues and unrealistic expectations. Armed with a better understanding of the subcontinent student cohort, this study encourages teaching and professional staff to find ways to develop a more inclusive educational environment that builds students up for success."
https://openalex.org/W4289638412,"Smoking is one of the most important causes of socioeconomic disparities in morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine if beliefs about harms of smoking differed across gender, smoking status and education among Norwegian adults born between 1899 and 1969.Using data from a nationally representative survey of smoking habits and a multinomial logit/negative binomial two-stage hurdle model design, we examined (first hurdle) the associations between birth cohort, gender, education and smoking status and four beliefs about cigarette smoking: i) smoking is not harmful, ii) do not know if smoking is harmful, iii) any number of cigarettes per day (CPD) is harmful and iv) smoking more than a given nonzero number of CPD is harmful, and (second hurdle) the predicted number of CPD that could be smoked without causing harm (from outcome iv).The probability of believing that smoking was not harmful was close to zero, regardless of birth cohort, sex, education and smoking status. The probability of not knowing if smoking was harmful decreased from around 0.7 to almost zero across cohorts. The probability of believing that smoking more than zero CPD was harmful increased from less than 0.1 to around 0.7, while the probability of believing that there is some safe level of smoking increased with cohorts born from 1900 to 1930 before declining. Respondents with primary/secondary education consistently believed smoking to be less harmful compared to respondents with tertiary education, but cohort trajectories were similar.The similar birth cohort trajectories in beliefs about the harms of smoking do not support the idea that Norwegian adults with lower education has had qualitatively different beliefs about the harmfulness of smoking compared to those with higher education. The persistent and large socioeconomic gradient is likely a result of other factors."
https://openalex.org/W4289638664,"Although once considered a 'counterfeit paradise', the Amazon Basin is now a region of increasing interest in discussions of pre-colonial tropical land-use and social complexity. Archaeobotany, archaeozoology, remote sensing and palaeoecology have revealed that, by the Late Holocene, populations in different parts of the Amazon Basin were using various domesticated plants, modifying soils, building earthworks, and even forming 'Garden Cities' along the Amazon River and its tributaries. However, there remains a relatively limited understanding as to how diets, environmental management, and social structures varied across this vast area. Here, we apply stable isotope analysis to human remains (n = 4 for collagen, n = 17 for tooth enamel), and associated fauna (n = 61 for collagen, n = 28 for tooth enamel), to directly determine the diets of populations living in the Volta Grande do Rio Xingu, an important region of pre-Columbian cultural interactions, between 390 cal. years BC and 1,675 cal. years AD. Our results highlight an ongoing dietary focus on C3 plants and wild terrestrial fauna and aquatic resources across sites and time periods, with varying integration of C4 plants (i.e. maize). We argue that, when compared to other datasets now available from elsewhere in the Amazon Basin, our study highlights the development of regional adaptations to local watercourses and forest types."
