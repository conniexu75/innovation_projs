https://openalex.org/W3216478751,"During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a variety of mutations have accumulated in the viral genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, at the time of writing, four variants of concern are considered to be potentially hazardous to human society1. The recently emerged B.1.617.2/Delta variant of concern is closely associated with the COVID-19 surge that occurred in India in the spring of 2021 (ref. 2). However, the virological properties of B.1.617.2/Delta remain unclear. Here we show that the B.1.617.2/Delta variant is highly fusogenic and notably more pathogenic than prototypic SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters. The P681R mutation in the spike protein, which is highly conserved in this lineage, facilitates cleavage of the spike protein and enhances viral fusogenicity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the P681R-bearing virus exhibits higher pathogenicity compared with its parental virus. Our data suggest that the P681R mutation is a hallmark of the virological phenotype of the B.1.617.2/Delta variant and is associated with enhanced pathogenicity."

We maximized hole transport across the layers of a metastable Dion-Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite that tuned the orientational arrangements of asymmetric bulky organic molecules. The reduced energy barrier for hole transport increased out-of-plane transport rates by a factor of 4 to 5, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the 2D PSC was 4.9%. With the metastable DJ 2D surface layer, the PCE of three common 3D PSCs was enhanced by approximately 12 to 16% and could reach approximately 24.7%. For a triple-cation–mixed-halide PSC, 90% of the initial PCE was retained after 1000 hours of 1-sun operation at ~40°C in nitrogen."

This approach has inspired researchers to try their hand at twisting two-dimensional (2D) magnets, but such experiments have proven a difficult challenge. Song et al . made structures out of layers of the 2D magnet chromium triiodide with a small twist angle (see the Perspective by Lado). Using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond as a magnetometer, the authors imaged the magnetic domains in both twisted monolayer and twisted trilayer structures. For twisted trilayers, a periodic pattern of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains was revealed. —JS"
https://openalex.org/W3175526778,"Hydroxylation of aryl carbon-hydrogen bonds with transition metal catalysts has proven challenging when oxygen is used as the oxidant. Here, we report a palladium complex bearing a bidentate pyridine/pyridone ligand that efficiently catalyzes this reaction at ring positions adjacent to carboxylic acids. Infrared, x-ray, and computational analysis support a possible role of ligand tautomerization from mono-anionic (L,X) to neutral (L,L) coordination in the catalytic cycle of aerobic carbon-hydrogen hydroxylation reaction. The conventional site selectivity dictated by heterocycles is overturned by this catalyst, thus allowing late-stage modification of compounds of pharmaceutical interest at previously inaccessible sites."

We trained a deep learning model to evaluate the dimensions of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta in 4.6 million cardiac magnetic resonance images from the UK Biobank. We then conducted genome-wide association studies in 39,688 individuals, identifying 82 loci associated with ascending and 47 with descending thoracic aortic diameter, of which 14 loci overlapped. Transcriptome-wide analyses, rare-variant burden tests and human aortic single nucleus RNA sequencing prioritized genes including SVIL, which was strongly associated with descending aortic diameter. A polygenic score for ascending aortic diameter was associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm in 385,621 UK Biobank participants (hazard ratio = 1.43 per s.d., confidence interval 1.32-1.54, P = 3.3 × 10-20). Our results illustrate the potential for rapidly defining quantitative traits with deep learning, an approach that can be broadly applied to biomedical images."
https://openalex.org/W3216928736,"Objectives This study aimed to identify coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine perception, acceptance, confidence, hesitancy, and barriers among health care workers (HCWs). Methods An online national cross-sectional pilot-validated questionnaire was self-administered by HCWs in Saudi Arabia, which is a nation with MERS-CoV experience. The main outcome variable was HCWs’ acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The factors associated with vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis, and the level of anxiety was measured using a validated instrument to measure general anxiety levels. Results Out of the 1512 HCWs who completed the study questionnaire—of which 62.4% were women—70% were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. A logistic regression analysis revealed that male HCWs (ORa = 1.551, 95% CI: 1.122–2.144), HCWs who believe in vaccine safety (ORa = 2.151; 95% CI: 1.708–2.708), HCWs who believe that COVID vaccines are the most likely way to stop the pandemic (ORa = 1.539; 95% CI: 1.259–1.881), and HCWs who rely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for COVID 19 updates (ORa = 1.505, 95% CI: 1.125–2.013) were significantly associated with reporting a willingness to be vaccinated. However, HCWs who believed that the vaccines were rushed without evidence-informed testing were found to be 60% less inclined to accept COVID-19 vaccines (ORa = 0.394, 95% CI: 0.298–0.522). Conclusion Most HCWs are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines once they are available; the satisfactoriness of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs is crucial because health professionals’ knowledge and confidence toward vaccines are important determining factors for not only their own vaccine acceptance but also recommendation for such vaccines to their patients."
https://openalex.org/W3215589136,"Humans differ in their susceptibility to infectious disease, partly owing to variation in the immune response after infection. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify variation in the response to influenza infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from European- and African-ancestry males. Genetic ancestry effects are common but highly cell type specific. Higher levels of European ancestry are associated with increased type I interferon pathway activity in early infection, which predicts reduced viral titers at later time points. Substantial population-associated variation is explained by cis-expression quantitative trait loci that are differentiated by genetic ancestry. Furthermore, genetic ancestry–associated genes are enriched among genes correlated with COVID-19 disease severity, suggesting that the early immune response contributes to ancestry-associated differences for multiple viral infection outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3215162076,"Confocal microscopy1 remains a major workhorse in biomedical optical microscopy owing to its reliability and flexibility in imaging various samples, but suffers from substantial point spread function anisotropy, diffraction-limited resolution, depth-dependent degradation in scattering samples and volumetric bleaching2. Here we address these problems, enhancing confocal microscopy performance from the sub-micrometre to millimetre spatial scale and the millisecond to hour temporal scale, improving both lateral and axial resolution more than twofold while simultaneously reducing phototoxicity. We achieve these gains using an integrated, four-pronged approach: (1) developing compact line scanners that enable sensitive, rapid, diffraction-limited imaging over large areas; (2) combining line-scanning with multiview imaging, developing reconstruction algorithms that improve resolution isotropy and recover signal otherwise lost to scattering; (3) adapting techniques from structured illumination microscopy, achieving super-resolution imaging in densely labelled, thick samples; (4) synergizing deep learning with these advances, further improving imaging speed, resolution and duration. We demonstrate these capabilities on more than 20 distinct fixed and live samples, including protein distributions in single cells; nuclei and developing neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, larvae and adults; myoblasts in imaginal disks of Drosophila wings; and mouse renal, oesophageal, cardiac and brain tissues. A combination of multiview imaging, structured illumination, reconstruction algorithms and deep-learning predictions realizes spatial- and temporal-resolution improvements in fluorescence microscopy to produce super-resolution images from diffraction-limited input images."
https://openalex.org/W3217453691,"Immune and tissue stem cells retain an epigenetic memory of inflammation that intensifies sensitivity to future encounters. We investigated whether and to what consequence stem cells possess and accumulate memories of diverse experiences. Monitoring a choreographed response to wounds, we found that as hair follicle stem cells leave their niche, migrate to repair damaged epidermis, and take up long-term foreign residence there, they accumulate long-lasting epigenetic memories of each experience, culminating in post-repair epigenetic adaptations that sustain the epidermal transcriptional program and surface barrier. Each memory is distinct, separable, and has its own physiological impact, collectively endowing these stem cells with heightened regenerative ability to heal wounds and broadening their tissue-regenerating tasks relative to their naïve counterparts."

Once something works, it may be unclear which specific features underpin the performance. A case in point is the stabilization of palladium(I) dimers, which has relied on a very small class of phosphine ligands. Hueffel et al . used machine learning to search for patterns in this known class of ligands and thereby guide the discovery of variants that likewise stabilize the dimers. The authors were able to synthesize eight previously unreported dimers. —JSY"
https://openalex.org/W3216662041,"Controlling interactions is the key element for the quantum engineering of many-body systems. Using time-periodic driving, a naturally given many-body Hamiltonian of a closed quantum system can be transformed into an effective target Hamiltonian that exhibits vastly different dynamics. We demonstrate such Floquet engineering with a system of spins represented by Rydberg states in an ultracold atomic gas. By applying a sequence of spin manipulations, we change the symmetry properties of the effective Heisenberg XYZ Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the relaxation behavior of the total spin is drastically modified. The observed dynamics can be qualitatively captured by a semiclassical simulation. Engineering a wide range of Hamiltonians opens vast opportunities for implementing quantum simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in a single experimental setting."
https://openalex.org/W3217131733,"Current therapies for Alzheimer's disease seek to correct for defective cholinergic transmission by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, these however have limited clinical efficacy. An alternative approach is to directly activate cholinergic receptors responsible for learning and memory. The M1-muscarinic acetylcholine (M1) receptor is the target of choice but has been hampered by adverse effects. Here we aimed to design the drug properties needed for a well-tolerated M1-agonist with the potential to alleviate cognitive loss by taking a stepwise translational approach from atomic structure, cell/tissue-based assays, evaluation in preclinical species, clinical safety testing, and finally establishing activity in memory centers in humans. Through this approach, we rationally designed the optimal properties, including selectivity and partial agonism, into HTL9936-a potential candidate for the treatment of memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. More broadly, this demonstrates a strategy for targeting difficult GPCR targets from structure to clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3214232062,"Viral-deletion mutants that conditionally replicate and inhibit the wild-type virus (i.e., defective interfering particles, DIPs) have long been proposed as single-administration interventions with high genetic barriers to resistance. However, theories predict that robust, therapeutic DIPs (i.e., therapeutic interfering particles, TIPs) must conditionally spread between cells with R0 >1. Here, we report engineering of TIPs that conditionally replicate with SARS-CoV-2, exhibit R0 >1, and inhibit viral replication 10- to 100-fold. Inhibition occurs via competition for viral replication machinery, and a single administration of TIP RNA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 sustainably in continuous cultures. Strikingly, TIPs maintain efficacy against neutralization-resistant variants (e.g., B.1.351). In hamsters, both prophylactic and therapeutic intranasal administration of lipid-nanoparticle TIPs durably suppressed SARS-CoV-2 by 100-fold in the lungs, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and prevented severe pulmonary edema. These data provide proof of concept for a class of single-administration antivirals that may circumvent current requirements to continually update medical countermeasures against new variants."
https://openalex.org/W3215300077,"Jellyfish are radially symmetric organisms without a brain that arose more than 500 million years ago. They achieve organismal behaviors through coordinated interactions between autonomously functioning body parts. Jellyfish neurons have been studied electrophysiologically, but not at the systems level. We introduce Clytia hemisphaerica as a transparent, genetically tractable jellyfish model for systems and evolutionary neuroscience. We generate stable F1 transgenic lines for cell-type-specific conditional ablation and whole-organism GCaMP imaging. Using these tools and computational analyses, we find that an apparently diffuse network of RFamide-expressing umbrellar neurons is functionally subdivided into a series of spatially localized subassemblies whose synchronous activation controls directional food transfer from the tentacles to the mouth. These data reveal an unanticipated degree of structured neural organization in this species. Clytia affords a platform for systems-level studies of neural function, behavior, and evolution within a clade of marine organisms with growing ecological and economic importance."
https://openalex.org/W3215181653,"Is it possible to reduce crime without exacerbating adversarial relationships between police and citizens? Community policing is a celebrated reform with that aim, which is now adopted on six continents. However, the evidence base is limited, studying reform components in isolation in a limited set of countries, and remaining largely silent on citizen-police trust. We designed six field experiments with Global South police agencies to study locally designed models of community policing using coordinated measures of crime and the attitudes and behaviors of citizens and police. In a preregistered meta-analysis, we found that these interventions led to mixed implementation, largely failed to improve citizen-police relations, and did not reduce crime. Societies may need to implement structural changes first for incremental police reforms such as community policing to succeed."

https://openalex.org/W3216773365,"<h2>Summary</h2> Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors are powerful tools for monitoring biochemical activities in live cells, but their multiplexing capacity is limited by the available spectral space. We overcome this problem by developing a set of barcoding proteins that can generate over 100 barcodes and are spectrally separable from commonly used biosensors. Mixtures of barcoded cells expressing different biosensors are simultaneously imaged and analyzed by deep learning models to achieve massively multiplexed tracking of signaling events. Importantly, different biosensors in cell mixtures show highly coordinated activities, thus facilitating the delineation of their temporal relationship. Simultaneous tracking of multiple biosensors in the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling network reveals distinct mechanisms of effector adaptation, cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects of KRAS mutations, as well as complex interactions in the network. Biosensor barcoding presents a scalable method to expand multiplexing capabilities for deciphering the complexity of signaling networks and their interactions between cells."
https://openalex.org/W3217393517,"During eukaryotic transcription elongation, RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) is regulated by a chorus of factors. Here, we identified a common binary interaction module consisting of TFIIS N-terminal domains (TNDs) and natively unstructured TND-interacting motifs (TIMs). This module was conserved among the elongation machinery and linked complexes including transcription factor TFIIS, Mediator, super elongation complex, elongin, IWS1, SPT6, PP1-PNUTS phosphatase, H3K36me3 readers, and other factors. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, live-cell microscopy, and mass spectrometry, we revealed the structural basis for these interactions and found that TND-TIM sequences were necessary and sufficient to induce strong and specific colocalization in the crowded nuclear environment. Disruption of a single TIM in IWS1 induced robust changes in gene expression and RNAP2 elongation dynamics, which underscores the functional importance of TND-TIM surfaces for transcription elongation."
https://openalex.org/W3215946130,"Fire activity varies substantially at global scales because of the influence of climate, but at broad spatiotemporal scales, the possible effects of herbivory on fire activity are unknown. Here, we used late Quaternary large-bodied herbivore extinctions as a global exclusion experiment to examine the responses of grassy ecosystem paleofire activity (through charcoal proxies) to continental differences in extinction severity. Grassy ecosystem fire activity increased in response to herbivore extinction, with larger increases on continents that suffered the largest losses of grazers; browser declines had no such effect. These shifts suggest that herbivory can have Earth system–scale effects on fire and that herbivore impacts should be explicitly considered when predicting changes in past and future global fire activity."
https://openalex.org/W3215648870,"Cancer cells are dependent upon an abundance of ribosomes to maintain rapid cell growth and proliferation. The rate-limiting step of ribosome biogenesis is ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by RNA polymerase I (Pol I). Therefore, a goal of the cancer therapeutic field is to develop and characterize Pol I inhibitors. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of Pol I inhibition by a first-in-class small-molecule BMH-21. To characterize the effects of BMH-21 on Pol I transcription, we leveraged high-resolution in vitro transcription assays and in vivo native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq). We find that Pol I transcription initiation, promoter escape, and elongation are all inhibited by BMH-21 in vitro. In particular, the transcription elongation phase is highly sensitive to BMH-21 treatment, as it causes a decrease in transcription elongation rate and an increase in paused Pols on the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) template. In vivo NET-seq experiments complement these findings by revealing a reduction in Pol I occupancy on the template and an increase in sequence-specific pausing upstream of G-rich rDNA sequences after BMH-21 treatment.

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) activity accounts for 60% of the transcriptional activity of a growing eukaryotic cell (1Warner J.R. The economics of ribosome biosynthesis in yeast.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Pol I is responsible for synthesizing the majority of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that assembles with ribosomal proteins to form the eukaryotic ribosome. Since Pol I transcription of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is the first, rate-limiting step of ribosome biogenesis (2Kopp K. Gasiorowski J.Z. Chen D. Gilmore R. Norton J.T. Wang C. Leary D.J. Chan E.K.L.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) cells, Pol I transcribes the rDNA that is organized in approximately 200 tandem repeats on chromosome XII. Each 9.1 kb repeat contains the 35S gene, transcribed by Pol I, and the 5S gene, transcribed by Pol III. Transcription of the 35S gene by Pol I yields the precursor 35S rRNA that is co- and post-transcriptionally modified (6Scull C.E. Schneider D.A. Coordinated control of rRNA processing by RNA polymerase I.Trends Genet. 2019; 35: 724-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to generate mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs. The rRNA synthesized by Pols I and III is processed and complexed with ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus. Finally, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm to execute protein synthesis. In most cancers, Pol I transcription is upregulated and drives ribosome biogenesis and subsequent protein synthesis (7Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. Does the ribosome translate cancer?.Nat. Rev.

The effects of BMH-21 on Pol I transcription and the degradation of A190/RPA194 are conserved between yeast and humans, making the yeast system an exceptional tool for defining BMH-21’s mechanism of action. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive analysis of BMH-21’s influence on Pol I catalyzed transcription. In this study, we leveraged high-resolution in vitro and in vivo techniques to elucidate BMH-21’s mechanism of inhibition of Pol I using the yeast model system. We discovered that Pol I transcription initiation, promoter escape, elongation, and occupancy of the rDNA were inhibited by BMH-21. BMH-21 reduced Pol I’s processivity in vitro, evidenced by reduced full-length RNA product synthesis. Additionally, we found that Pol I transcription elongation is the most sensitive step to BMH-21 treatment. Our in vitro conclusions were complemented in vivo with native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq). Pol I occupancy of the rDNA was reduced after acute BMH-21 treatment and Pol I elongation complexes preferentially paused upstream of G-rich sequences. This study reveals the mechanism of action for this small-molecule inhibitor that is supported both in vitro and in vivo. To identify the impact of BMH-21 treatment on transcription catalyzed by Pol I, we utilized a fully reconstituted transcription assay (32Schneider D.A. Michel A. Sikes M.L. Vu L. Dodd J.A. Salgia S. Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase I is linked to efficient rRNA processing and ribosome assembly.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 217-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that includes all the required purified components for Pol I transcription: Pol I, core factor (CF), TATA-binding protein (TBP), and Rrn3 (Fig. 1). The template DNA includes a modified yeast rDNA template, mutated to not encode for C until the +56 position (with respect to the transcription start site). Once all the purified protein components are assembled, the DNA template and NTP substrates (ATP, GTP, α-32P-UTP) are added to allow the polymerase to initiate transcription and transcribe to the +55 position. Heparin is added to sequester unbound Pols to ensure we observe a single round of transcription. Finally, CTP and unlabeled UTP are added, releasing the polymerases from the +55 position to transcribe the remainder of the 800 base pair template. Reactions are run on polyacrylamide gels to resolve resultant RNA products for further analysis. To determine the impact of BMH-21 on different steps in Pol I transcription, we added BMH-21 at different points in the reaction scheme. By varying the order of addition, these assays probe for the influence of BMH-21 on Pol I transcription initiation, promoter escape, and elongation (red stars in Fig. 1). Transcription initiation involves many steps: first, transcription factors bind to the promoter region. Then, Pol I is recruited to form a preinitiation complex. DNA is unwound and initial RNA synthesis begins. The final stage of transcription initiation, promoter escape, occurs when Pol I clears the promoter region and advances on the template. To assay the impact of BMH-21 on transcription initiation, we added BMH-21 (125 nM–4 μM) or vehicle to the template prior to adding Pol I, TBP, CF, and Rrn3. ATP, GTP, and α-32P-UTP (20 μM) were provided for 5 min to allow Pol I to transcribe up to the +55 position. CTP and unlabeled UTP (20 μM) were added to the synchronized polymerases, releasing them from the +55 halt point. Each reaction proceeded for 10 min, allowing all complexes to synthesize full-length RNA products. Reactions were run on polyacrylamide gels and the abundance of full-length RNAs was analyzed (Fig. 2A). The amount of RNA synthesized by Pol I was reduced by increasing concentrations of BMH-21. Data were fit to a single exponential to calculate an IC50 value of 0.81 μM BMH-21 (Fig. 2B). To control for the possibility that reduced full-length RNA products in the presence of BMH-21 (Fig. 2A) resulted from an inhibition of elongation rather than initiation, we treated Pol I transcription reactions during the elongation phase with vehicle or BMH-21 (1 μM) over a time course. Preinitiation complexes were incubated with ATP, GTP, and α-32P-UTP (20 μM) for 5 min. Simultaneously, BMH-21 (1 μM) or vehicle was added to the reactions with CTP and unlabeled UTP (20 μM). Reactions were stopped after 1, 4, and 10 min and run on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. S1). The time courses reveal that BMH-21 caused a delay in accumulation of full-length products, evident at the 4-min time points. However, the amplitude of the full-length products at the 10-min time points was identical between the vehicle- and BMH-21-treated samples (Fig. S1). Therefore, 10-min time points, as shown in Figure 2A, are not sensitive to transcription elongation rate effects. The simplest explanation for these data is that the reduction of full-length products in the presence of BMH-21, shown in Figure 2A, is due to inhibition of transcription initiation. We found a reduced amount of full-length RNA products when BMH-21 was added to the rDNA template, suggesting that BMH-21 inhibits transcription initiation. To determine if promoter escape was specifically inhibited by BMH-21, we formed the preinitiation complexes and added BMH-21 (300 nM) simultaneously with ATP, GTP, and α-32P-UTP (20 μM). Pol I complexes were allowed to synthesize through the promoter region up to the +55 position for 5 min. At t = 0, CTP and unlabeled UTP were added to the reactions and were stopped over time (30 s–4 min). The full-length RNAs were resolved on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3A). If BMH-21 interfered with Pol I’s ability to clear the promoter and move down the template, we would detect a reduction in full-length RNAs. We found that Pol I synthesized less full-length products in the presence of BMH-21 compared with the vehicle control. We observed a suppression of full-length products over the time course in the presence of BMH-21, maximally causing a 49% reduction at 4 min (Fig. 3B). We conclude that multiple steps in transcription initiation are vulnerable to BMH-21. Previously, we found that BMH-21 slows transcription elongation based on the observation that full-length RNA accumulation was slower in the presence of the compound (31Wei T. Najmi S.M. Liu H. Peltonen K. Kucerova A. Schneider D.A. Laiho M. Small-molecule targeting of RNA polymerase I activates a conserved transcription elongation checkpoint.Cell Rep. 2018; 23: 404-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). While strongly suggestive of direct inhibition of Pol I transcription elongation, this approach does not provide quantitative evaluation of transcription elongation kinetics. Here, we deploy a more quantitative assay (33Scull C.E. Ingram Z.M. Lucius A.L. Schneider D.A. A novel assay for RNA polymerase I transcription elongation sheds light on the evolutionary divergence of eukaryotic RNA polymerases.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to directly measure Pol I transcription elongation rate in the presence of increasing concentrations of BMH-21. Preinitiation complexes were formed and incubated with ATP, GTP, and α-32P-UTP (1 mM) for 5 min. At t = 0, CTP and unlabeled UTP (1 mM) were added simultaneously with BMH-21 or vehicle to release synchronized Pols from the +55 position. For each treatment condition (vehicle or 125 nM–4 μM BMH-21), four time points were collected. Reactions were resolved on polyacrylamide gels alongside a reference nucleic acid ladder to calculate the RNA length (nt) of the leading population of synthesized RNAs at each time point (Fig. 4A). Transcription elongation rate was measured by plotting the RNA length as a function of time and calculating the slope of the resultant line (Fig. S2). Transcription elongation rate was reduced by BMH-21 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.43 ± 0.06 μM BMH-21 (Fig. 4B). Additionally, we visualized increased Pol I pausing in the BMH-21-treated reactions, evidenced by shorter RNA bands observed throughout the time courses, but this pausing was absent in the vehicle-treated reactions (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the locations of the pause sites were conserved across the BMH-21 treated reactions. These data suggest that BMH-21 causes sequence-specific pausing of Pol I in vitro. Taken together, these data show that BMH-21 inhibits transcription initiation, promoter escape, and elongation (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). NET-seq probes for polymerase occupancy, which we define here as the positioning of Pol I on the rDNA template, at single-nucleotide resolution in vivo. This technique was first developed to study Pol II (34Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), but we recently adapted and optimized it to detect Pol I occupancy with high reproducibility (35Huffines A.K. Edwards Y.J.K. Schneider D.A. Spt4 promotes pol I processivity and transcription elongation.Genes. 2021; 12: 413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 36Clarke A.M. Engel K.L. Giles K.E. Petit C.M. Schneider D.A. NETSeq reveals heterogeneous nucleotide incorporation by RNA polymerase I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E11633-E11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Scull C.E. Clarke A.M. Lucius A.L. Schneider D.A. Downstream sequence-dependent RNA cleavage and pausing by RNA polymerase I.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 1288-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NET-seq for both vehicle- and BMH-21-treated yeast was performed in biological triplicate. The vehicle-treated libraries were aligned to the yeast genome and the 5′ read ends (which correspond to the 3′ ends of nascent transcripts) were plotted with respect to their position on the 35S gene (Fig. S3A, left panel). At each position, the “counts” value indicates the number of Pol I complexes occupying that position on the rDNA at the time of harvest. A high count value represents a highly occupied position or peak, whereas a low count value can be interpreted as a lesser occupied position or trough. While transcription elongation kinetics cannot be determined from these experiments, it is reasonable to equate peaks with positions where Pol I is stalled on the template, whereas troughs may represent regions of rapid transcription elongation by Pol I. To assess whether the Pol I occupancy patterns displayed for the vehicle-treated replicates were statistically similar, the Spearman correlation test was executed (Fig. S3A, right panel). This test ranks the occupancy in two replicates by count (highest to lowest), compares the ranking between the replicates, and generates a coefficient value. This value indicates the correlation between the two replicates, where 1 represents 100% similarity. The histogram generation and Spearman correlation test analysis were repeated for the BMH-21-treated samples (Fig. S3B), and like the vehicle-treated data, these results also displayed high similarity. Therefore, we concluded that this technique is highly reproducible and is a powerful method to visualize Pol I occupancy under treatment conditions at high resolution in vivo. Using NET-seq, we tested the effect of acute BMH-21 treatment (50 μM for 2 min) on Pol I occupancy in vivo as compared with vehicle treatment. We plotted the median Pol I occupancy across the three replicates for each treatment (Fig. 5). At each position, a t-test was executed to determine the p-value between treatments. A p-value < 0.05 was deemed a significant difference in occupancy and was denoted by either a black (decreased) or green (increased) bar below the histogram, for the BMH-21-treated samples with respect to vehicle-treated. These data indicate that there is a significantly different occupancy pattern between the two treatment groups, as there is a depletion of Pol I especially in the spacer regions [external transcribed spacer 1 (ETS1), internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), external transcribed spacer 2 (ETS2)]. One limitation of the NET-seq technique is that there is unavoidable mature rRNA contamination in the libraries. This is especially evident in Figure 5, where there are still Pol I peaks present in the gene regions of the BMH-21-treated samples, despite the reduction in occupancy in the spacer regions. From previous literature, it has been established that processing/maturation of the rRNA begins to occur co-transcriptionally and results in removal of the spacer RNAs (32Schneider D.A. Michel A. Sikes M.L. Vu L. Dodd J.A. Salgia S. Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase I is linked to efficient rRNA processing and ribosome assembly.Mol.

Furthermore, we performed NET-seq using a strain of yeast containing untagged Pol I to investigate the pattern of contamination in our samples. The data from this untagged Pol I control demonstrate that while there is high signal in the gene regions, reads mapping to the spacer regions were minimal (Fig. S4), confirming that the contamination in our sample is, indeed, mature rRNAs. Therefore, since it is impossible to remove mature rRNA contamination in the experiment, the spacer regions are critically important for observing nascent transcription by Pol I. Thus, we performed an in-depth analysis of Pol I occupancy in these regions (Fig. 6). In all four of the rDNA spacer regions, there was robust reduction in Pol I occupancy in the BMH-21-treated samples as compared with vehicle-tr"

We isolated human 17S U2 snRNP and reconstituted in vitro its adenosine 5´-triphosphate (ATP)–dependent remodeling and binding to the pre–messenger RNA substrate. We determined a series of high-resolution (2.0 to 2.2 angstrom) structures providing snapshots of the BS selection process. The substrate-bound U2 snRNP shows that SF3B6 stabilizes the BS:U2 snRNA duplex, which could aid binding of introns with poor sequence complementarity. ATP-dependent remodeling uncoupled from substrate binding captures U2 snRNA in a conformation that competes with BS recognition, providing a selection mechanism based on branch helix stability."

Therefore, this paper proposes a medical image encryption algorithm based on a new five-dimensional three-leaf chaotic system and genetic operation. And the dynamic analysis of the phase diagram and bifurcation diagram of the five-dimensional three-leaf chaotic system selected in this paper is carried out, and NIST is used to test the randomness of its chaotic sequence. This algorithm follows the diffusion-scrambling framework, especially using the principle of DNA recombination combined with the five-dimensional three-leaf chaotic system to generate a chaotic matrix that participates in the operation. The bit-level DNA mutation operation is introduced in the diffusion, and the scrambling and diffusion effects have been further improved. Algorithm security and randomness have been enhanced. This paper evaluates the efficiency of this algorithm for medical image encryption in terms of security analysis and time performance. Security analysis is carried out from key space, information entropy, histogram, similarity between decrypted image and original image, PSNR, correlation, sensitivity, noise attack, cropping attack and so on. Perform time efficiency analysis from the perspective of time performance. The comparison between this algorithm and the experimental results obtained by some of the latest medical image encryption algorithms shows that this algorithm is superior to the existing medical image encryption algorithms to a certain extent in terms of security and time efficiency."

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the tau microtubule (MT)-binding domain (MBD), which encompasses two hexapeptide motifs that act as critical nucleating regions for tau aggregation, can potentially modulate tau aggregation as well as interactions with MTs and membranes. Here, we characterize the effects of a recently discovered tau PTM, lysine succinylation, on tau-tubulin interactions and compare these to the effects of two previously reported MBD modifications, lysine acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation. As generation of site-specific PTMs in proteins is challenging, we used short synthetic peptides to quantify the effects on tubulin binding of three site-specific PTMs located within the PHF6∗ (paired helical filament [PHF] residues 275-280) and PHF6 (residues 306-311) hexapeptide motifs: K280 acetylation, Y310 phosphorylation, and K311 succinylation. We compared these effects to those observed for MBD PTM-mimetic point mutations K280Q, Y310E, and K311E. Finally, we evaluated the effects of these PTM-mimetic mutations on MBD membrane binding and membrane-induced fibril and oligomer formation. We found that all three PTMs perturb tau MT binding, with Y310 phosphorylation exerting the strongest effect. PTM-mimetic mutations partially recapitulated the effects of the PTMs on MT binding and also disrupted tau membrane binding and membrane-induced oligomer and fibril formation. These results imply that these PTMs, including the novel and Alzheimer's disease-specific succinylation of tau K311, may influence both the physiological and pathological interactions of tau and thus represent targets for therapeutic intervention."

Surprisingly, no clear quantum signatures of roaming have been observed to date, despite the quantum nature of the roaming event. We found evidence of quantum dynamics in the photodissociation of formaldehyde near the roaming threshold. This is ascribed to resonances associated to H+HCO(Ka = 1) that have a profound impact on the CO rotational and translational energy distributions and cause the roaming fraction to vary by a factor of 2 over an energy range of 10 cm–1. The roaming pathway serves both to modulate and report on the complex vibrational dynamics and coupling among the three dissociation pathways in the excited molecule as it decays to products."
https://openalex.org/W3215206847,"In the preparation of commercial conjugate vaccines, capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) must undergo chemical modification to generate the reactive groups necessary for covalent attachment to a protein carrier. One of the most common approaches employed for this derivatization is sodium periodate (NaIO4) oxidation of vicinal diols found within CPS structures. This procedure is largely random and structurally damaging, potentially resulting in significant changes in the CPS structure and therefore its antigenicity. Additionally, periodate activation of CPS often gives rise to heterogeneous conjugate vaccine products with variable efficacy. Here, we explore the use of an alternative agent, galactose oxidase (GOase) isolated from Fusarium sp. in a chemoenzymatic approach to generate a conjugate vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using a colorimetric assay and NMR spectroscopy, we found that GOase generated aldehyde motifs on the CPS of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (Pn14p) in a site-specific and reversible fashion. Direct comparison of Pn14p derivatized by either GOase or NaIO4 illustrates the functionally deleterious role chemical oxidation can have on CPS structures. Immunization with the conjugate synthesized using GOase provided a markedly improved humoral response over the traditional periodate-oxidized group. Further, functional protection was validated in vitro by measure of opsonophagocytic killing and in vivo through a lethality challenge in mice. Overall, this work introduces a strategy for glycoconjugate development that overcomes limitations previously known to play a role in the current approach of vaccine design."

Here, we report that the expression of RecQ family helicases, including RECQL5, is regulated by the deubiquitinase USP28. We found using genetic depletion or a small molecule inhibitor that like RECQL5, USP28 is also essential for TNBC cells to proliferate in vitro and in vivo. Compromising the function of USP28 by shRNA knockdown or the inhibitor caused TNBC cells to arrest in S/G2 phases, concurrent with DNA-damage checkpoint activation.

https://openalex.org/W3215054717,"Nrf2 is an antioxidant transcriptional activator in many types of cells, and its dysfunction plays key roles in a variety of human disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD-affected brain regions. Dopamine treatment of neuronal cells stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases ROS-dependent neuronal apoptosis. In this study, we found that the ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) protein reduces dopamine-induced ROS production of neuronal cells and ROS-dependent apoptosis by stimulating the antioxidant activity of Nrf2. USP10 interacted with the Nrf2 activator p62, increased the phosphorylation of p62, increased the interaction of p62 with the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1, and stimulated Nrf2 antioxidant transcriptional activity. In addition, USP10 augmented dopamine-induced Nrf2 translation. Taken together, these results indicate that USP10 is a key regulator of Nrf2 antioxidant activity in neuronal cells and suggest that USP10 activators are promising therapeutic agents for oxidative stress-related diseases, including PD."

On days 0, 15, 60, and 120 after the first immunization, blood samples were taken to measure immunoglobulins. On the same day of the challenge, the splenocytes were isolated and assayed for the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-10. After vaccinations, the animals were challenged and all of them were affected by the disease which led to their death. The G6 and G8 groups provided 10% protection and the G7 provided 20%. The G3 and G4 groups provided 30% and 40% protection respectively. The peptides showed the production of Total IgG antibodies and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α), indicating a possible activation of the Th1 type response. However, groups G3, G5, G6, and G8 showed production of IL-17. None of the study groups showed IL-10 production.

The observed kinetic and structural mechanisms governing nucleotide misincorporation reveal the general principles likely applicable to other high-fidelity DNA polymerases. The molecular basis for the extraordinary specificity of enzymes has been a longstanding question in enzymology. In 1959, Koshland proposed an induced-fit model to explain enzyme specificity (1Koshland Jr., D.E. Enzyme flexibility and enzyme action.J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1959; 54: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which was a departure from the lock and key model previously proposed by Fischer (2Fischer E. Einfluss der configuration auf die Wirkung der enzyme.Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft. 1894; 27: 2985-2993Crossref Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Koshland proposed that an enzyme active site was “not initially a negative of the substrate but became so only after interaction with substrate. This change in conformation of the protein occurred with the result that the final enzyme-substrate complex had the catalytic groups on the enzyme in the proper alignment with each other and with the bonds to be broken in the substrate molecules.” Today, structural examples of this phenomenon are abundant but the role of induced fit in enzyme specificity has been debated since it was first proposed. Specificity is a kinetic phenomenon that is difficult to resolve from structure alone. Namely, the ability of an enzyme to discriminate between competing substrates is defined by their relative kcat/Km values. Structural studies alone fail to distinguish multiple models positing how enzyme conformational changes might or might not contribute to kcat/Km values because key questions remain unanswered. How fast is the conformational change relative to the rate of the chemical reaction? Is the conformational change rapidly reversible? How do these kinetic parameters change when the enzyme encounters a different potential substrate? DNA polymerases provide an optimal system for understanding enzyme specificity because fidelity and speed of DNA replication are biologically important for maintaining genome integrity, the alternate substrates (mismatched nucleotides as dictated by the template) are well defined, and crystal structures show large conformational changes in the enzyme after nucleotide binding (3Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Crystal structure of a bacteriophage T7 DNA replication complex at 2.2 A resolution.Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Moreover, measurements of free energy changes in DNA duplex formation in solution indicate relatively small differences (0.2–4 kcal/mol) between right and wrong base pairs at 37 °C (4Goodman M.F. Hydrogen bonding revisited: Geometric selection as a principal determinant of DNA replication fidelity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), providing a selectivity of only 5 to 100-fold, which is orders of magnitude lower than the observed fidelity. Therefore, the role of the enzyme in enforcing specificity is profound. While the extraordinarily high specificity of these enzymes is well established, the roles of different steps in the kinetic pathway remain controversial (1Koshland Jr., D.E. Enzyme flexibility and enzyme action.J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1959; 54: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Herschlag D.

Acc. 2012; 131: 1288Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the nucleotide-induced conformational change observed when comparing structures of binary polymerase-DNA complexes to ternary polymerase-DNA-dNTP complexes (3Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Crystal structure of a bacteriophage T7 DNA replication complex at 2.2 A resolution.Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Questions about the role of this conformational change in DNA polymerase fidelity are abundant in the literature and many theoretical arguments have been proposed (7Prasad B.R. Kamerlin S.C.L. Florian J. Warshel A. Prechemistry barriers and checkpoints do not contribute to fidelity and catalysis as long as they are not rate limiting.Theor. Chem.

Conformational coupling in DNA polymerase fidelity.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The contribution of conformational changes to kcat/Km has been controversial partly due to the difficulty of measuring the rates and equilibria governing changes in enzyme structure during a single catalytic turnover. However, there is no shortage of theoretical studies speculating how conformational changes might contribute to specificity, often with conflicting ideas. The original proposal by Koshland (1Koshland Jr., D.E. Enzyme flexibility and enzyme action.J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1959; 54: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) lacked any quantitative rationale for how enzyme structural changes could contribute to specificity as opposed to simply leading to increased rates of catalysis due to alignment of catalysis residues. The central question is how changes in enzyme structure can attenuate kcat/Km values for alternative substrates, not just kcat values. Herschlag attempted to delineate how conformational changes could contribute to specificity in certain cases, such as when the conformational change was rate limiting (5Herschlag D. The role of induced fit and conformational changes of enzymes in specificity and catalysis.Bioorganic Chem. 1988; 16: 62-69Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Fersht asserted that a two-step binding pathway cannot contribute more to fidelity than a thermodynamically equivalent one-step binding (10Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism.3rd ed. Freeman, New York, NY1999Google Scholar), but his analysis assumed a rapid-equilibrium conformational change step. Post and Ray later proposed that a conformational change could still contribute to specificity when the chemical step is rate limiting, but the two conformational states catalyze the reaction through different transition states (6Post C.B. Ray Jr., W.J. Reexamination of induced fit as a determinant of substrate specificity in enzymatic reactions.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15881-15885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Tsai and Johnson provided the first evidence for a new paradigm to understand how a fast substrate-induced conformational change could be the major determinant of specificity even when the chemistry step was rate limiting (11Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. A new paradigm for DNA polymerase specificity.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies on HIV reverse transcriptase (HIVRT) by Kellinger and Johnson provided additional quantitative support for this model (12Kellinger M.W. Johnson K.A. Nucleotide-dependent conformational change governs specificity and analog discrimination by HIV reverse transcriptase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 7734-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Kellinger M.W. Johnson K.A. Role of induced fit in limiting discrimination against AZT by HIV reverse transcriptase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5008-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), including full molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (14Kirmizialtin S. Johnson K.A. Elber R. Enzyme selectivity of HIV reverse transcriptase: Conformations, ligands, and free energy partition.J. Phys. Chem.

How conformational dynamics of DNA polymerase select correct substrates: Experiments and simulations.Structure. 2012; 20: 618-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Countering these results, Warshel argued forcefully that prechemistry barriers and checkpoints cannot contribute to fidelity and catalysis as long as they are not rate limiting (7Prasad B.R. Kamerlin S.C.L. Florian J. Warshel A. Prechemistry barriers and checkpoints do not contribute to fidelity and catalysis as long as they are not rate limiting.Theor. Chem. Acc. 2012; 131: 1288Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, Warshel failed to distinguish rate-limiting steps (kcat) from specificity-determining steps (kcat/Km), which need not be identical. Not all polymerases follow the Tsai–Johnson induced-fit paradigm. In particular, for low-fidelity enzymes, Pol β and Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, the prechemistry conformational changes appear to be rapid-equilibrium steps coupled to nucleotide binding (16Roettger M.P.

Conformational landscapes of DNA polymerase I and mutator derivatives establish fidelity checkpoints for nucleotide insertion.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HIVRT afforded clear data to support the induced-fit paradigm, but it could be argued that HIVRT is unusual because it has only moderate fidelity and must replicate both RNA and DNA. In addition, there are concerns over the validity of the conclusions in the original Tsai–Johnson paper because mutations required to make a cys-light variant to site-specifically label the enzyme altered its fidelity and stability. Therefore, it is especially important to rigorously test the role of enzyme conformational dynamics in specificity using a high-fidelity polymerase that does not require construction of a cys-light variant. T7 DNA polymerase has long been an important, simple model system for understanding fidelity as only two polypeptides (T7 gene product 5 and thioredoxin) are required for robust polymerization and exonuclease proofreading activity (3Doublie S.

We previously reported methods to site specifically incorporate the fluorescent unnatural amino acid (7-hydroxy-4-coumarin-yl)-ethylglycine (7-HCou) into the fingers domain of T7 DNA polymerase. We showed that this variant has similar fidelity to the wild-type enzyme, while the fluorescent amino acid gives a signal to measure the nucleotide-induced conformational change (30Dangerfield T.L.

We determined the complete kinetic pathway of correct nucleotide incorporation, including measurements of the rates of translocation during processive synthesis (31Dangerfield T.L. Johnson K.A.

Chem. 2021; 296: 100143-100161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Full understanding of DNA polymerase fidelity, however, requires parallel analysis of the pathway of misincorporation, including the role of conformational changes, which we address in this paper. Here we examine the kinetics of mismatch formation using an exonuclease-deficient form of the enzyme (D5A/E7A) to measure the innate fidelity during the DNA polymerization step (29Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of processive DNA replication including complete characterization of an exonuclease-deficient mutant.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, we will examine the kinetic basis for selectivity of the proofreading exonuclease to assess its role in overall fidelity. To obtain an estimate for the fidelity for the T7 DNA polymerase, we began by measuring specificity constants (kcat/Km) for each possible misincorporation and then determined the discrimination against each mismatch to calculate the range of fidelity values for the enzyme. We then determined the complete kinetic pathway for T:dTTP misincorporation and extension of this mismatch with dTTP (when the next templating base is an A), including measurement of the dynamics of conformational changes along the pathway. To gain structural insights for bound mismatches at the polymerase active site, we performed all atom MD simulations on three complexes and report the resulting active site structures, along with quantification of hydrogen bond parameters as well as distances from the 3ʹ-OH of the primer to the α-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. These structures highlight the misalignment of catalytic residues and the noncanonical base pairing that occurs with mismatches in the active site of the polymerase. While kcat/Km values for a correct- and a mismatched-nucleotide incorporation have been reported (8Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A.

Are certain mismatches incorporated more efficiently than others? What is the range of discrimination against different mismatch combinations? To address these questions, we performed single turnover kinetic experiments with all 12 possible mismatch combinations to estimate kcat/Km for each. Measurements of the specificity constant (kcat/Km) were used to calculate a discrimination index (D) against each mismatch defined by the ratio of kcat/Km values for correct (measured previously (32Donlin M.J. Johnson K.A. Mutants affecting nucleotide recognition by T7 DNA polymerase.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14908-14917Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) versus mismatched nucleotide incorporation.D=(kcat/Km)correct(kcat/Km)mismatch In our single turnover kinetic experiments, a 27 nt 5ʹ-[6-FAM] (6-carboxyfluorescein) labeled primer was annealed to a 45 nt template containing A, C, G, or T as the templating base at position 18 (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). Since the experiments were performed with an excess of enzyme over DNA, the observed time dependence of product formation defined the rate of reaction at the active site of the enzyme during a single turnover. Various nucleotide concentrations were mixed with the enzyme-DNA complex to start the reaction, then samples were quenched by adding EDTA, and products were resolved and quantified by capillary electrophoresis (see Experimental procedures).Table 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligo nameSequence 5ʹ→ 3ʹExtinction coefficient, 260 nm (M−1 cm−1)27CCGTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAAC245,70027-TCCGTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAACT253,50027-TddCCGTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAACTdd253,500FAM-27[6-FAM]-CCGTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAAC266,660FAM-27-T[6-FAM]-CCGTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAACT269,20045-18AGGACGGCATTGGATCGAAGTTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGACGG437,60045-18CGGACGGCATTGGATCGACGTTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGACGG432,40045-18GGGACGGCATTGGATCGAGGTTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGACGG435,70045-18TGGACGGCATTGGATCGATGTTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGACGG433,700Cy3-28[Cy3]-CCGTGAGTTGGTTGGACGGCTGCGAGGC266,800The bases in bold in the table represent the position of the templating base at position 18 of the template strand when annealed to the 27 nt primer.Here we give the sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study.

To designate various base-pair combinations, we use the shorthand notation X:dNTP where X is the templating base and dNTP is the incoming nucleotide. The A:dCTP misincorporation reaction was chosen as a representative data set to illustrate the results and methods of analysis as shown in Figure 1. Initially data were analyzed by conventional methods by fitting each reaction time course to a single exponential function (Fig. 1A), then plotting the observed rate versus nucleotide concentration (Fig. 1B). The rate versus concentration plot was then fit to a hyperbolic function to estimate kcat/Km. Since mismatch binding is weak, as demonstrated by the lack of significant curvature in the rate versus concentration plot, we cannot extract accurate values for kcat and Km individually, but kcat/Km is well defined from the initial slope of the concentration dependence of the observed rate. Fitting the data by simulation (Fig. 1C) in KinTek Explorer (34Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T.

The data were fit using the kinetic model shown at the top of Figure 1, where kα = kcat/Km and kβ = kcat, respectively.

This analysis was repeated for all possible mismatch combinations to give the results summarized in Table 2. A threshold in χ2min/χ2 equal to 0.85 (based on the number of parameters and data points in the fitting, calculated by the software using the F-distribution) was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval for each parameter.Table 2Kinetic parameters for all possible templating base/dNTP combinationsTemplating basedNTPkcat/Km (M−1s−1)kcat (s−1)Km (mM)DiscriminationAdATP147 ± 20≥1.3≥8.8112,200 ± 24,400dCTP143 ± 15≥1.2≥8.4115,400 ± 23,000dGTP10 ± 1>0.07>6 mM1,650,000 ± 325,000dTTP[1.65 ± 0.28] × 107297 ± 100.018 ± 0.0031CdATP190 ± 25≥0.4≥2.172,100 ± 15,800dCTP1.4 ± 0.2≥0.075≥509,800,000 ± 2,200,000dGTP[1.37 ± 0.24] × 107246 ± 120.018 ± 0.0031dTTP31 ± 4≥0.6≥19442,000 ± 96,200GdATP295 ± 40≥0.7≥2.489,200 ± 17,200dCTP[2.63 ± 0.36] × 107447 ± 300.017 ± 0.0021dGTP61 ± 8≥0.3≥4.9431,000 ± 81,700dTTP195 ± 20≥1.1≥5.6135,000 ± 23,000TdATP[1.56 ± 0.26] × 107280 ± 40.018 ± 0.0031dCTP43 ± 5≥2.1≥48363,000 ± 74,000dGTP265 ± 40≥1.3≥4.959,000 ± 13,000dTTP130 ± 25≥0.5≥3.8120,000 ± 31,000The bases in bold in the table represent the position of the templating base at position 18 of the template strand when annealed to the 27 nt primer.

From the measured kcat/Km values for each mismatched base pair from this study and previously reported kcat/Km values for all correct nucleotide incorporations (32Donlin M.J. Johnson K.A. Mutants affecting nucleotide recognition by T7 DNA polymerase.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14908-14917Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we calculated the discrimination against each mismatch, which can also be thought of as the average number of bases incorporated before an error is made. The highest discrimination index was for the C:dCTP mismatch, with a kcat/Km of 1.4 ± 0.2 M−1s−1 and a discrimination index of 9,800,000. The lowest discrimination was for the T:dGTP mismatch, with a kcat/Km of 265 ± 40 M−1s−1 and a discrimination index of 59,000. Given the wide range of values (Table 2), an average discrimination index (1.1 million) is not very meaningful. Perhaps more useful, the median value of the discrimination index is approximately 130,000. Although this represents a high overall fidelity compared with other polymerases, the true accuracy is a product of the selectivity during polymerization and the subsequent selective removal of mismatches by the proofreading exonuclease, which is largely governed by the extent to which the p"

Information on plant traits is a powerful predictor of ecosystem dynamics and functioning. We reviewed the major ecological traits, such as foliar gas exchange and nutrients, xylem morphology and drought tolerance, of Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa , which are major timber species in East Asia, especially in Japan, by using a recently developed functional trait database for both species (SugiHinokiDB). Empirically, C . obtusa has been planted under drier conditions, whereas C . japonica , which grows faster but thought to be less drought tolerant, has been planted under wetter conditions. Our analysis generally support the empirical knowledge: The maximum photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, foliar nutrient content and soil-to-foliage hydraulic conductance were higher in C . japonica than in C . obtusa . In contrast, the foliar turgor loss point and xylem pressure corresponding to 50% conductivity, which indicate drought tolerance, were lower in C . obtusa and are consistent with the drier habitat of C . obtusa . Ontogenetic shifts were also observed; as the age and height of the trees increased, foliar nutrient concentrations, foliar minimum midday water potential and specific leaf area decreased in C . japonica , suggesting that nutrient and water limitation occurs with the growth. In C . obtusa , the ontogenetic shits of these foliar traits were less pronounced. Among the Cupressaceae worldwide, the drought tolerance of C . obtusa , as well as C . japonica , was not as high. This may be related to the fact that the Japanese archipelago has historically not been subjected to strong dryness. The maximum photosynthetic rate showed intermediate values within the family, indicating that C . japonica and C . obtusa exhibit relatively high growth rates in the Cupressaceae family, and this is thought to be the reason why they have been selected as economically suitable timber species in Japanese forestry. This study clearly demonstrated that the plant trait database provides us a promising opportunity to verify out empirical knowledge of plantation management and helps us to understand effect of climate change on plantation forests by using trait-based modelling."

High-glucose stress has been shown to perturb membrane properties by decreasing membrane fluidity, and the membrane sensor PAQR-2 is required to restore membrane integrity. However, the mechanisms required to respond to elevated dietary glucose are not fully established. In this study, we used a 13C stable isotope-enriched diet and mass spectrometry to better understand the impact of glucose on fatty acid dynamics in the membrane of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found a novel role for monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) in mediating the ability of the nematodes to survive conditions of elevated dietary glucose. This requirement of mmBCFAs is unique to glucose stress and was not observed when the nematode was fed elevated dietary saturated fatty acid. In addition, when worms deficient in elo-5, the major biosynthesis enzyme of mmBCFAs, were fed Bacillus subtilis (a bacteria strain rich in mmBCFAs) in combination with high glucose, their survival rates were rescued to wild-type levels. Finally, the results suggest that mmBCFAs are part of the PAQR-2 signaling response during glucose stress. Taken together, we have identified a novel role for mmBCFAs in stress response in nematodes and have established these fatty acids as critical for adapting to elevated glucose.

In many disease states, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, defects in membrane structure and composition have been identified (1Gianfrancesco M.A. Paquot N. Piette J.

Biological membranes are essential barriers between the intracellular and extracellular environment and are also crucial in the compartmentalization of subcellular organelles. Membranes are not limited to establishing passive barriers, but they also influence numerous and diverse cellular bioactivities such as signaling and regulation (7Budin I. de Rond T. Chen Y.

Although membranes allow a certain degree of variation in their makeup, it is critical to maintain a membrane composition within an acceptable range for optimal cellular function. Several studies have shown that there are regulatory mechanisms, including membrane sensors, that detect perturbations in the biophysical properties of the membrane and can allow membranes to adapt to variations in environmental cues including temperature and dietary composition (12Siliakus M.F. van der Oost J. Kengen S.W.M. Adaptations of archaeal and bacterial membranes to variations in temperature, pH and pressure.Extremophiles. 2017; 21: 651-670Google Scholar, 13Svensk E. Devkota R. Ståhlman M. Ranji P.

Caenorhabditis elegans PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 protect against glucose toxicity by modulating membrane lipid composition.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12e1005982Google Scholar). Model systems including the nematode, Caenorhabitis elegans, have been established in order to probe the regulation of membrane composition and the response to perturbations. In addition to the genetic tools available, C. elegans has the added advantage of being small enough to allow for high isotope enrichment and subsequent detailed measurements of membrane flux. Our lab has developed stable isotope feeding strategies in C. elegans to track the incorporation of new fatty acid molecules into the membrane (14Perez C.L. Van Gilst M.R. A 13C isotope labeling strategy reveals the influence of insulin signaling on lipogenesis in C. elegans.Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 266-274Google Scholar, 15Dancy B.C.R. Chen S. Drechsler R. Gafken P.R. Olsen C.P. 13C- and 15N-labeling strategies combined with mass spectrometry comprehensively quantify phospholipid dynamics in C. elegans.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0141850Google Scholar). Using this technique, we established that the majority of the membrane lipids are replaced or modified within a 24-h period in young animals. This replacement is significantly greater in the phospholipids showing 1.7-fold faster renewal than in neutral lipids used to store fat in the same animals (15Dancy B.C.R. Chen S. Drechsler R. Gafken P.R. Olsen C.P. 13C- and 15N-labeling strategies combined with mass spectrometry comprehensively quantify phospholipid dynamics in C. elegans.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0141850Google Scholar, 16Sultana N. Olsen C.P. Using stable isotope tracers to monitor membrane dynamics in C. elegans.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2020; 233: 104990Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to responding to external and internal stimuli, the phospholipid membrane is a highly dynamic structure with tremendous flux of lipids in and out of the membrane even under basal conditions. Not only is the turnover greatly abundant in membrane lipids, but the rates differ depending on the specific type of lipid, thus allowing for the maintenance of overall membrane composition and adjustment of that content when needed. Monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) are present in plants, bacteria, and animals, and decreased levels of mmBCFAs in humans have been linked to obesity and insulin resistance (17Su X. Magkos F. Zhou D. Eagon J.C. Fabbrini E. Okunade A.L. Klein S. Adipose tissue monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids and insulin sensitivity: Effects of obesity and weight loss.Obesity (Silver Spring). 2015; 23: 329-334Google Scholar). In C. elegans, mmBCFAs are found within the membrane at significant concentrations, accounting for about 5.5% of the relative abundance of FAs. They are synthesized from branched-chain amino acids particularly leucine through the activity of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH), fatty acid synthase (FASN-1), and acetyl-coA carboxylase (POD-2) ultimately resulting in the production of C13iso, which is elongated by elo-5 and elo-6 to make C15iso and C17iso; (18Kniazeva M. Crawford Q.T. Seiber M. Wang C. Han M. Monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids play an essential role in Caenorhabditis elegans development.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E257Google Scholar, 19Kniazeva M.

A branched-chain fatty acid is involved in post-embryonic growth control in parallel to the insulin receptor pathway and its biosynthesis is feedback-regulated in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2102-2110Google Scholar). mmBCFAs are critical for post embryonic growth facilitated in part by activating TORC1 signaling pathway to facilitate nutrient sensing and metabolism in nematodes (20Kniazeva M.

Nomura D.K. et al.Enzyme promiscuity drives branched-chain fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissues.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 1021-1031Google Scholar). In bacteria, the presence of mmBCFAs impacts the packing of the membrane and influences overall membrane fluidity (23Mercier R. Dominguez-Cuevas P. Errington J. Crucial role for membrane fluidity in proliferation of primitive cells.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 417-423Google Scholar, 24Jones S.L. Drouin P. Wilkinson B.J. Morse P.D. Correlation of long-range membrane order with temperature-dependent growth characteristics of parent and a cold-sensitive, branched-chain-fatty-acid-deficient mutant of Listeria monocytogenes.Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 217-222Google Scholar). In fact, two branched-chain fatty acid classes, referred to as iso and anteiso, contain a methyl group at either the penultimate or the antepenultimate carbon, respectively, and are the most prominent fatty acids of cell membranes of some bacteria, especially of the genus Bacillus. The presence of these branched fatty acids has a different impact on membrane properties such as packing, since they mimic properties of both straight-chain saturated and cis-monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The ratio iso/anteiso fatty acids is reduced when the growth temperature is decreased, indicating that anteiso species strongly affect membrane fluidity compared with iso species (25Eibler D. Abdurahman H. Ruoff T. Kaffarnik S. Steingass H. Vetter W. Unexpected formation of low amounts of (R)-configurated anteiso-fatty acids in rumen fluid experiments.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0170788Google Scholar, 26Rilfors L. Difference in packing properties between iso and anteiso methyl-branched fatty acids as revealed by incorporation into the membrane lipids of A choleplasma laidlawii strain A.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 813: 151-160Google Scholar). However, the participation of mmBCFAs in the response to other external stress such as high glucose diet has not yet been described. Altered conditions such as temperature changes require that the membrane composition is adjusted in order to maintain the membrane’s properties. For instance, lower temperatures reduce overall membrane fluidity in poikilotherms and, thus, require an increase in the amount of unsaturated fatty acids provided to the membrane to maintain membrane function (27Holthuis J.C.M. Menon A.K. Lipid landscapes and pipelines in membrane homeostasis.Nature. 2014; 510: 48-57Google Scholar, 28Watts J.L. Ristow M. Lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2017; 207: 413-446Google Scholar). The presence of double bonds in the cis configuration causes kinks or bends in the acyl chain, affecting the overall fatty acid packing and consequently the membrane structure increasing fluidity (29van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: Where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008 Feb; 9: 112-124Google Scholar). The amount of saturated fat within a membrane must be balanced with monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids to tune the biophysical properties of the membrane (30Farine L. Niemann M. Schneider A. Bütikofer P. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by the Kennedy pathway occurs at different sites in Trypanosoma brucei.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 16787Google Scholar). Other fatty acids including mmBCFA contribute to overall membrane fluidity and permeability as well. Glucose homeostasis is critical, and organisms have multiple regulatory mechanisms that allow them to maintain optimum membrane composition when challenged with glucose. For example, PAQR-2 is a protein capable of sensing and responding to the accumulation of saturated fat within the endoplasmic reticulum induced by cold temperature. Additionally, PAQR-2 is required for survival in other conditions that perturb the membrane properties including excess dietary glucose (31Devkota R. Svensk E. Ruiz M. Ståhlman M. Borén J. Pilon M. The adiponectin receptor AdipoR2 and its Caenorhabditis elegans homolog PAQR-2 prevent membrane rigidification by exogenous saturated fatty acids.PLoS Genet. 2017; 13e1007004Google Scholar). In the absence of PAQR-2, nematodes fed glucose accumulate SFAs, have a withered tail, and reduced viability. The most well-characterized role for PAQR-2 is to provide UFA to the membrane through the FAT-7 desaturase, which incorporates the first double bond into the saturated fatty acids. However, it is unclear if PAQR-2 influences the activity of other metabolic pathways that contribute to survival in elevated glucose diets. Although it is clear that membrane composition is impacted by glucose stress, the mechanisms involved in responding to perturbations in membrane properties have not been completely defined. In our studies, we use stable isotope labeling under elevated glucose conditions to monitor the fatty acid populations of the membrane after stress. Our results unveiled a novel role for mmBCFAs in surviving elevated glucose conditions. We have probed these relationships to find that nematodes not producing mmBCFAs show decreased survivorship when stressed with glucose. While it has been established that high-glucose diets require a compensatory metabolic shift in lipid pathways, the specific alterations in the membrane lipids of animals exposed to excess glucose have not been identified. To define the response to dietary glucose, we transferred larval (L4) C. elegans to 15 mM glucose supplementation plates (referred to as “+gluc plates”), which is the concentration where phenotypes are observed in paqr-2 mutant animals with minimal lethality (13Svensk E. Devkota R. Ståhlman M. Ranji P. Rauthan M. Magnusson F. Hammarsten S. Johansson M. Borén J. Pilon M. Caenorhabditis elegans PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 protect against glucose toxicity by modulating membrane lipid composition.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12e1005982Google Scholar). After 12 h on +gluc plates, animals were collected, fatty acid methyl esters were created from the major lipid classes (i.e., phospholipids, neutral lipids, glycolipids) and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to quantify the relative abundance of associated fatty acids (see Experimental procedures) (14Perez C.L. Van Gilst M.R. A 13C isotope labeling strategy reveals the influence of insulin signaling on lipogenesis in C. elegans.Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 266-274Google Scholar). We will use the standard nomenclature (CX:YnZ) to describe the fatty acid populations where X indicates the number of carbons in the fatty acid, and Y shows the number of double bonds at position Z for our analysis. We first examined the changes in phospholipids on +gluc plates focusing on the major fatty acid populations (>1.5% of the total pool). Here, we do not report the fatty acid analysis for the polyunsaturated fatty acids, because they contain more than two double bonds and fragment extensively in the mass spectrometer making them incompatible with the stable isotope studies reported later. We found that there were no significant changes in any major fatty acid species with the exception of a decrease in vaccenate (C18:1n7) from 18.1 ± 0.8% to 15.7 ± 0.6% and a slight increase in palmitate (C16:0) from 3.7 ± 0.2% to 4.8 ± 0.3% (Fig. 1A). The reduction in C18:1n7 levels is likely due to the reduced presence of this species in the bacteria exposed to glucose. The lack of major changes in the phospholipid populations has been previously demonstrated by HPLC-MS-based studies as well (13Svensk E. Devkota R. Ståhlman M. Ranji P. Rauthan M. Magnusson F. Hammarsten S. Johansson M. Borén J. Pilon M. Caenorhabditis elegans PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 protect against glucose toxicity by modulating membrane lipid composition.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12e1005982Google Scholar). The result further supports the presence of maintenance mechanisms to specifically control the fatty acid composition of the membrane lipids under elevated glucose concentrations. These maintenance pathways may be specific to membrane lipids or may regulate lipid metabolism pathways in general. Therefore, to determine whether glucose supplementation impacts the other pools within the nematode, we evaluated the neutral lipid fraction, which represents the stored fat. After extraction and analysis by GC-MS, we found more significant changes in the overall fatty acid profile from neutral lipids. Specifically, there are significant decreases of multiple fatty acid populations including a reduction of vaccenate (C18:1n7) by 22%, oleate (C18:1n9) by 17%. The mmBCFAs, 13-methyl myristic acid (C15iso), and 15-methyl hexadecanoic acid (C17iso) were decreased by 23% and 17% respectively (Fig. 1B). These alterations support the conclusion that glucose supplementation drives changes in lipid metabolism pathways and that the neutral lipid pools are regulated less than phospholipid populations. One potential issue using the GC/MS to analyze the membrane composition is that changes in lipid pools might be diluted by the preexisting large quantities of lipids at the start of the glucose stress. Therefore, we incorporated a global dietary stable isotope tracer to monitor the different types of lipids provided to the membrane immediately following glucose supplementation. The nematodes were fed bacteria enriched with 13C-isotopes by growing the standard laboratory diet (OP50) in Isogro 13C-enriched media (>99% 13C from Sigma-Aldrich) (15Dancy B.C.R. Chen S. Drechsler R. Gafken P.R. Olsen C.P. 13C- and 15N-labeling strategies combined with mass spectrometry comprehensively quantify phospholipid dynamics in C. elegans.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0141850Google Scholar). After the appropriate corrections (defined in the Experimental procedures), the stable isotope labeling was examined in the palmitate (C16:0) population, as previous studies have observed high levels of palmitate in the absence of corrective pathways. There is a significant reduction in the provision of C16:0 to the membrane with 8.6 ± 0.6% of C16:0 being newly incorporated in glucose-fed worms compared with 11.5 ± 0.3% in control animals (Fig. 1C). To determine if this decrease is a common feature of saturated fatty acids, we examined C18:0 and found no significant decrease in C18:0 stable isotope patterns. Thus, we conclude that the downregulation of flux is specific to C16:0 and not all saturated fatty acids. Because of the use of a general stable isotope tracer, we can probe the remaining fatty acid species in the same animals with the exception of the C20 PUFAs that fragment extensively in the mass spectrometer. The dynamics of the C18 mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, namely oleate (C18:1n9) and linoleate (C18:2n6), were not impacted by the glucose supplementation (Fig. 1C). However, we identified a significant increase in the provision of vaccenate (C18:1n7) and the mmBCFA, C17iso, to the membrane (Fig. 1C). This mmBCFA species is not significant component of the diet, and thus this increase likely represents de novo synthesis of these fats. Specifically, the labeled population in C18:1n7 increases by 27% and by 23% in C17iso. Overall, most unsaturated membrane lipids are unchanged from control populations, but there is an overall reduction in the labeling of saturated fatty acids and an increase in mmBCFAs following glucose feeding. We hypothesize that these changes may be important responses to the elevated glucose levels. In order to determine if there is an increase in mmBCFA production, we next examined the expression of the fat-6 and fat-7 desaturases and the mmBCFA elo-5 and elo-6 elongases after glucose feeding. In previous reports, fat-7 has been shown to be upregulated with glucose diets, and the qRT-PCR analysis completed here shows a significant increase in expression with glucose feeding (Fig. 1D). This upregulation is specific to fat-7 as fat-6 mRNA levels are unchanged. There is a significant increase of both elo-5 and elo-6 expression by 1.8 and 1.7-fold indicating that these genes are transcriptionally upregulated to promote mmBCFA synthesis in elevated glucose conditions (Fig. 1D). Because the stable isotope labeling shows increased mmBCFA provision to the membrane following glucose supplementation, we tested if mmBCFAs play a role in responding to the elevated glucose conditions. We compromised their production with elo-5 RNAi because ELO-5 is the elongase essential for the synthesis of both significant mmBCFA species, C15iso and C17iso (Fig. 2A). A 12-h feeding period before elo-5 RNAi treatment was used to prevent the smaller size and shorter life span seen with elo-5 RNAi initiated immediately at L1. After 48 h of growth, L4 animals were placed on 15 mM +gluc plates as in the previous lipid studies or a higher 45 mM +gluc plate to ensure sufficient glucose exposure. At both glucose concentrations, there was significantly more death in the elo-5-treated animals than the controls. Here, we report the highest concentration of glucose where only 6 ± 5% of the elo-5-treated animals were alive at day 4 compared with 82 ± 6% of the controls (Fig. 2B). The fatty acid data generated from labeled N2 animals fed glucose showed a significant change in the provision of C17iso but not C15iso to the membrane. We therefore investigated whether depleting C17iso alone would result in altered survival in high-glucose conditions. To do so, we examined the role of ELO-6, which is only required for C17iso production (Fig. 2A). The elo-6 RNAi-treated animals survived the glucose treatment similarly to wild-type animals with 81 ± 5% alive at day 4 (Fig. 2B) suggesting that the depletion of C17iso at least by 73% is not sufficient to cause death (Fig 2C). In support of this conclusion, the elo-6 RNAi treatment reduces overall mmBCFA levels by 50%, while elo-5 RNAi nearly eliminates the mmBCFAs completely (Fig 2C). To confirm the role of mmBCFAs in directly impacting the response to glucose, we fed nematodes a diet containing 50% Bacillus subtilis, because this bacterial strain contains high levels of mmBCFAs. Consistent with our results indicating a role for mmBCFAs in responding to elevated dietary glucose, B. subtilis feeding restored the survival rates of animals on +gluc plates back to wild-type levels (Fig 2D). The levels of mmBCFAs in B. subtilis are 11.2 ± 0.3% C15iso and 5.2 ± 0.1% C17iso Fig 2E) compared with OP50 where mmBCFAs are completely absent (Fig 2E). Additionally, B. subtilis contains a high percentage of anteiso mmBCFA species that terminates in an isobutyl and not an isopropyl as in the iso species. Consistent with our results indicating a role for mmBCFAs in responding to elevated dietary glucose, B. subtilis feeding restored the survival rates of animals on +gluc plates back to wild-type levels (Fig. 2D). To ensure that this rescue of nematode viability with B. subtilis supplementation was not due to elo-5 RNAi bacteria dilution, we fed wild-type nematodes a L4440/elo-5 mixture to confirm sufficient RNAi knockdown with a diluted RNAi bacterial diet. Animals fed the L4440/elo-5 mixture show high mortality under glucose stress, confirming our data presented previously (Fig. S1). Thus, B. subtilis can rescue phenotypes caused by the absence of ELO-5, and we conclude that the incorporation of new mmBCFAs from synthesis or from the diet is critical for glucose stress survival. To further examine the relationship of mmBCFA in survival with glucose stress, we tested whether mmBCFA production was actively needed on +gluc plates or simply the presence of mmBCFAs synthesized prior to glucose exposure. We tested it by compromising mmBCFA synthesis only during adulthood and assessed the viability on +gluc plates. The elo-5 knockdown was initiated concurrently with the glucose stress in day 1 adults. In the adult-only elo-5 RNAi treatment, there is significantly reduced survival compared with controls with treated animals showing 50% of viability in day 9 as opposed to controls reaching 50% of viability in day 11 (Fig. 2F). The reduced survival on +gluc plates demonstrates that there is an active role for mmBCFA synthesis in responding to glucose that is independent of the abundance of mmBCFAs accumulated during development. Finally, we confirmed that elo-5 (gk208) mutants also died prematurely on +gluc plates with 27% ± 10% alive at day 4 compared with 76 ± 5% alive in control animals (Fig. 2G). These experiments demonstrate for the first time a critical role for mmBCFAs in surviving glucose stress and elucidate a novel function for these unique fatty acids in adult animals. Previous studies characterize this seven-transmembrane protein PAQR-2 as an important membrane sensor that responds to decreased membrane fluidity resulting from excess glucose. Because of the high mortality of elo-5 knockdown animals on +gluc plates (Fig. 2B), we hypothesized that the elo-5 elongase could be activated by PAQR-2 as part of the metabolic response to glucose stress. To probe this relationship, we assessed the membrane composition of paqr-2 (tm3410) mutants immediately after glucose stress and analyzed their mmBCFAs abundance with GC/MS. We found significantly less mmBCFAs (C15iso and C17iso) in the membranes of paqr-2 animals on +gluc plates compared with paqr-2 animals on control plates (Fig. 3A). Specifically, C15iso was depleted from 1.7 ± 0.1% to 1.1 ± 0.1% and C17iso from 5.3 ± 0.3% to 3.0 ± 0.2% with glucose treatment, demonstrating that PAQR-2 may be required to maintain mmBCFA levels under glucose stress. To further investigate the impact of PAQR-2 in the response to elevated glucose, we analyzed the membrane dynamics of paqr-2 mutants with stable isotope labeling as previously described. In paqr-2 mutant animals, there is a significant reduction in the labeling of mmBCFAs with C15iso levels decreasing from 8.6 ± 0.6% to 5.6 ± 0.7% and C17iso from 6.1 ± 0.3% to 2.5 ± 0.3%, indicating that PAQR-2 may be required for the upregulation of ELO-5. Furthermore, the analysis of the other fatty acid species in the membrane indicates a global reduction in the turnover of all species in paqr-2 mutant animals on +gluc plates with the greatest decrease observed in linoleate (C18:2n6) (71% reduction) (Fig. 3B). It is important to note that the paqr-2 mutants are unhealthy on glucose plates, so the reduction in turnover may be a consequence of their compromised health (13Svensk E. Devkota R. Ståhlman M. Ranji P. Rauthan M. Magnusson F. Hammarsten S. Johansson M. Borén J. Pilon M. Caenorhabditis elegans PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 protect against glucose toxicity by modulating membrane lipid composition.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12e1005982Google Scholar). However, PAQR-2 has been found to regulate fat-7 expression, and reduction of fat-7 by RNAi results in a global reduction of fatty acid flux, presumably to mitigate the impact of the compromised fatty acid pool on the membrane (15Dancy B.C.R. Chen S. Drechsler R. Gafken P.R. Olsen C.P. 13C- and 15N-labeling strategies combined with mass spectrometry comprehensively quantify phospholipid dynamics in C. elegans.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0141850Google Scholar). Since PAQR-2 is known to impact transcription of metabolic genes, we sought to examine the expression of elo-5 in these mutants with and without glucose. First, we confirmed the requirement of PAQR-2 to induce fat-7 expression with glucose and found that fat-7 is expressed at 0.4 the levels of control animals (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, fat-7 in PAQR-2 animals is at approximately 80% of wild-type expression in the"

Thus, an understanding of the drivers of the structure of communities inhabiting alpine lakes is important to predict potential changes in the future. To this end, we sampled benthic macroinvertebrate communities and measured environmental variables (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, nitrate, turbidity, blue-green algal phycocyanin, chlorophyll-a) as well as structural parameters (habitat type, lake size, maximum depth) in 28 lakes within Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria, between altitudes of 2,000 and 2,700 m a.s.l. The most abundant macroinvertebrate taxa that we found were Chironomidae and Oligochaeta. Individuals of Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Tricladida, Trombidiformes, Veneroida were found across the lakes and determined to family level. Oligochaeta were not determined further. Generalized linear modeling and permanova were used to identify the impact of measured parameters on macroinvertebrate communities. We found that where rocky habitats dominated the lake littoral, total macroinvertebrate abundance and family richness were lower while the ratio of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) was higher. Zoo- and phytoplankton densities were measured in a subset of lakes but were not closely associated with macroinvertebrate abundance or family richness. With increasing elevation, macroinvertebrate abundances in small and medium-sized lakes increased while they decreased in large lakes, with a clear shift in community composition (based on families). Our results show that habitat parameters (lake size, habitat type) have a major influence on benthic macroinvertebrate community structure whereas elevation itself did not show any significant effects on communities. However, even habitat parameters are likely to change under climate change scenarios (e.g. via increased erosion) and this may affect alpine lake macroinvertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W3214774067,"Gendered economic and social systems can enable relational power disparities for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), and undercut autonomy to negotiate sex and contraceptive use. Less is known about their accumulation and interplay. This study characterizes relationship power imbalances (age disparity, intimate partner violence [IPV], partner-related fear, transactional sex, and transactional partnerships), and evaluates associations with modern contraceptive use, and sexual/reproductive autonomy threats (condom removal/""stealthing"", reproductive coercion, ability to refuse sex, and contraceptive confidence).Cross-sectional surveys were conducted with unmarried, currently-partnered AGYW aged 15-24 recruited via respondent-driven sampling in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (n = 555; 2018-19), Nairobi, Kenya (n = 332; 2019), and Lagos, Nigeria (n = 179; 2020). Descriptive statistics, Venn diagrams, and multivariate regression models characterized relationship power imbalances, and associations with reproductive autonomy threats and contraceptive use.Relationship power imbalances were complex and concurrent. In current partnerships, partner-related fears were common (50.4%Nairobi; 54.5%Abidjan; 55.7%Lagos) and physical IPV varied (14.5%Nairobi; 22.1%Abidjan; 9.6%Lagos). IPV was associated with reproductive coercion in Nairobi and Abidjan. Age disparate relationships undermined confidence in contraception in Nairobi. In Nairobi and Lagos, transactional sex outside the relationship was associated with condom stealthing.AGYW face simultaneous gendered power differentials, against the backdrop of gendered social and economic systems. Power imbalances were linked with coercive sexual/reproductive health experiences which are often underrecognized yet represent a potent link between gendered social systems and poor health. Pregnancy prevention efforts for AGYW must address reproductive autonomy threats, and the relational power imbalances and broader gendered systems that enable them."
https://openalex.org/W3216926879,"The G-quadruplex (G4) resolvase RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element (RHAU) possesses the ability to unwind G4 structures in both DNA and RNA molecules. Previously, we revealed that RHAU plays a critical role in embryonic heart development and postnatal heart function through modulating mRNA translation and stability. However, whether RHAU functions to resolve DNA G4 in the regulation of cardiac physiology is still elusive. Here, we identified a phenotype of noncompaction cardiomyopathy in cardiomyocyte-specific Rhau deletion mice, including such symptoms as spongiform cardiomyopathy, heart dilation, and death at young ages. We also observed reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and advanced sarcomere maturation in Rhau mutant mice. Further studies demonstrated that RHAU regulates the expression levels of several genes associated with ventricular trabeculation and compaction, including the Nkx2-5 and Hey2 that encode cardiac transcription factors of NKX2-5 and Hey2, and the myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7) whose protein product is MYH7. While RHAU modulates Nkx2-5 mRNA and Hey2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level, we uncovered that RHAU facilitates the transcription of Myh7 through unwinding of the G4 structures in its promoter. These findings demonstrated that RHAU regulates ventricular chamber development through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. These results contribute to a knowledge base that will help to understand the pathogenesis of diseases such as noncompaction cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3215156757,"Glycoproteins are difficult to crystallize because they have heterogeneous glycans composed of multiple monosaccharides with considerable rotational freedom about their O-glycosidic linkages. Crystallographers studying N-glycoproteins often circumvent this problem by using β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (MGAT1)-deficient mammalian cell lines, which produce recombinant glycoproteins with immature N-glycans. These glycans support protein folding and quality control but can be removed using endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H). Many crystallographers also use the baculovirus-insect cell system (BICS) to produce recombinant proteins for their work but have no access to an MGAT1-deficient insect cell line to facilitate glycoprotein crystallization in this system. Thus, we used BICS-specific CRISPR-Cas9 vectors to edit the Mgat1 gene of a rhabdovirus-negative Spodoptera frugiperda cell line (Sf-RVN) and isolated a subclone with multiple Mgat1 deletions, which we named Sf-RVNLec1. We found that Sf-RVN and Sf-RVNLec1 cells had identical growth properties and served equally well as hosts for baculovirus-mediated recombinant glycoprotein production. N-glycan profiling showed that a total endogenous glycoprotein fraction isolated from Sf-RVNLec1 cells had only immature and high mannose-type N-glycans. Finally, N-glycan profiling and endoglycosidase analyses showed that the vast majority of the N-glycans on three recombinant glycoproteins produced by Sf-RVNLec1 cells were Endo H-cleavable Man5GlcNAc2 structures. Thus, this study yielded a new insect cell line for the BICS that can be used to produce recombinant glycoproteins with Endo H-cleavable N-glycans. This will enable researchers to combine the high productivity of the BICS with the ability to deglycosylate recombinant glycoproteins, which will facilitate efforts to determine glycoprotein structures by X-ray crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W3217218464,"The Escherichia coli yobA-yebZ-yebY (AZY) operon encodes the proteins YobA, YebZ, and YebY. YobA and YebZ are homologs of the CopC periplasmic copper-binding protein and the CopD putative copper importer, respectively, whereas YebY belongs to the uncharacterized Domain of Unknown Function 2511 family. Despite numerous studies of E. coli copper homeostasis and the existence of the AZY operon in a range of bacteria, the operon's proteins and their functional roles have not been explored. In this study, we present the first biochemical and functional studies of the AZY proteins. Biochemical characterization and structural modeling indicate that YobA binds a single Cu2+ ion with high affinity. Bioinformatics analysis shows that YebY is widespread and encoded either in AZY operons or in other genetic contexts unrelated to copper homeostasis. We also determined the 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of E. coli YebY, which closely resembles that of the lantibiotic self-resistance protein MlbQ. Two strictly conserved cysteine residues form a disulfide bond, consistent with the observed periplasmic localization of YebY. Upon treatment with reductants, YebY binds Cu+ and Cu2+ with low affinity, as demonstrated by metal-binding analysis and tryptophan fluorescence. Finally, genetic manipulations show that the AZY operon is not involved in copper tolerance or antioxidant defense. Instead, YebY and YobA are required for the activity of the copper-related NADH dehydrogenase II. These results are consistent with a potential role of the AZY operon in copper delivery to membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W3217723047,"The catabolism of pectin from plant cell walls plays a crucial role in the virulence of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii. In particular, the timely expression of pel genes encoding major pectate lyases is essential to circumvent the plant defense systems and induce massive pectinolytic activity during the maceration phase. Previous studies identified the role of a positive feedback loop specific to the pectin-degradation pathway, whereas the precise signals controlling the dynamics of pectate lyase expression were unclear. Here, we show that the latter is controlled by a metabolic switch involving both glucose and pectin. We measured the HPLC concentration profiles of the key metabolites related to these two sources of carbon, cAMP and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, and developed a dynamic and quantitative model of the process integrating the associated regulators, cAMP receptor protein and KdgR. The model describes the regulatory events occurring at the promoters of two major pel genes, pelE and pelD. It highlights that their activity is controlled by a mechanism of carbon catabolite repression, which directly controls the virulence of D. dadantii. The model also shows that quantitative differences in the binding properties of common regulators at these two promoters resulted in a qualitatively different role of pelD and pelE in the metabolic switch, and also likely in conditions of infection, justifying their evolutionary conservation as separate genes in this species."
