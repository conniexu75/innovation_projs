https://openalex.org/W1991432514,"Haematopoietic stem cells are found to be regulated differently in male and female mice — haematopoietic stem cells in females divide more frequently than in males in response to oestrogen and this difference depends on the ovaries but not the testes; using a genetic approach, it is shown that the effect is dependent on expression of oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) in stem cells. The extent to which stem cells are regulated by long-range signals versus local signals within tissues is a fundamental question in stem-cell biology. Much recent research has focused on how the stem-cell niche responds to local signals within tissues. But in conditions such as starvation or pregnancy it is likely that systemic signals will modulate stem-cell function in multiple tissues, and this study demonstrates a long-range effect of oestrogen on haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in pregnant mice. Using a genetic approach, the authors show that HSC stimulation, which would help the mother to meet increased haematopoietic demands, is dependent on expression of the oestrogen receptor (ERα). Hormonal levels differ in males and females but so too do the HSC cells — stem cells in female mice divide significantly more frequently than those in male mice in response to oestrogen. Sexually dimorphic mammalian tissues, including sexual organs and the brain, contain stem cells that are directly or indirectly regulated by sex hormones1,2,3,4,5,6. An important question is whether stem cells also exhibit sex differences in physiological function and hormonal regulation in tissues that do not show sex-specific morphological differences. The terminal differentiation and function of some haematopoietic cells are regulated by sex hormones7,8,9,10, but haematopoietic stem-cell function is thought to be similar in both sexes. Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem cells exhibit sex differences in cell-cycle regulation by oestrogen. Haematopoietic stem cells in female mice divide significantly more frequently than in male mice. This difference depends on the ovaries but not the testes. Administration of oestradiol, a hormone produced mainly in the ovaries, increased haematopoietic stem-cell division in males and females. Oestrogen levels increased during pregnancy, increasing haematopoietic stem-cell division, haematopoietic stem-cell frequency, cellularity, and erythropoiesis in the spleen. Haematopoietic stem cells expressed high levels of oestrogen receptor-α (ERα). Conditional deletion of ERα from haematopoietic stem cells reduced haematopoietic stem-cell division in female, but not male, mice and attenuated the increases in haematopoietic stem-cell division, haematopoietic stem-cell frequency, and erythropoiesis during pregnancy. Oestrogen/ERα signalling promotes haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal, expanding splenic haematopoietic stem cells and erythropoiesis during pregnancy."

https://openalex.org/W2014555485,"Enzyme stability is an important issue for protein engineers. Understanding how rigidity in the active site affects protein kinetic stability will provide new insight into enzyme stabilization. In this study, we demonstrated enhanced kinetic stability of Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB) by mutating the structurally flexible residues within the active site. Six residues within 10 Å of the catalytic Ser(105) residue with a high B factor were selected for iterative saturation mutagenesis. After screening 2200 colonies, we obtained the D223G/L278M mutant, which exhibited a 13-fold increase in half-life at 48 °C and a 12 °C higher T50(15), the temperature at which enzyme activity is reduced to 50% after a 15-min heat treatment. Further characterization showed that global unfolding resistance against both thermal and chemical denaturation also improved. Analysis of the crystal structures of wild-type CalB and the D223G/L278M mutant revealed that the latter formed an extra main chain hydrogen bond network with seven structurally coupled residues within the flexible α10 helix that are primarily involved in forming the active site. Further investigation of the relative B factor profile and molecular dynamics simulation confirmed that the enhanced rigidity decreased fluctuation of the active site residues at high temperature. These results indicate that enhancing the rigidity of the flexible segment within the active site may provide an efficient method for improving enzyme kinetic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2066497226,This article addresses the boundary layer flow and heat transfer in third grade fluid over an unsteady permeable stretching sheet. The transverse magnetic and electric fields in the momentum equations are considered. Thermal boundary layer equation includes both viscous and Ohmic dissipations. The related nonlinear partial differential system is reduced first into ordinary differential system and then solved for the series solutions. The dependence of velocity and temperature profiles on the various parameters are shown and discussed by sketching graphs. Expressions of skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are calculated and analyzed. Numerical values of skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number are tabulated and examined. It is observed that both velocity and temperature increases in presence of electric field. Further the temperature is increased due to the radiation parameter. Thermal boundary layer thickness increases by increasing Eckert number.
https://openalex.org/W2036449456,"Cancer cells are characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, which are produced mainly by the mitochondria. The dismutase SOD2 localizes in the matrix and is a major antioxidant. The activity of SOD2 is regulated by the deacetylase SIRT3. Recent studies indicated that SIRT3 is decreased in 87% of breast cancers, implying that the activity of SOD2 is compromised. The resulting elevation in reactive oxygen species was shown to be essential for the metabolic reprograming toward glycolysis. Here, we show that SOD2 itself is down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines. Further, activation of oncogenes, such as Ras, promotes the rapid down-regulation of SOD2. Because in the absence of SOD2, superoxide levels are elevated in the matrix, we reasoned that mechanisms must exist to retain low levels of superoxide in other cellular compartments especially in the intermembrane space of the mitochondrial to avoid irreversible damage. The dismutase SOD1 also acts as an antioxidant, but it localizes to the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. We report here that loss of SOD2 correlates with the overexpression of SOD1. Further, we show that mitochondrial SOD1 is the main dismutase activity in breast cancer cells but not in non-transformed cells. In addition, we show that the SOD1 inhibitor LCS-1 leads to a drastic fragmentation and swelling of the matrix, suggesting that in the absence of SOD2, SOD1 is required to maintain the integrity of the organelle. We propose that by analogy to the cadherin switch during epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer cells also undergo a SOD switch during transformation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and in the case of chronic bronchitis represents an inflammatory response of the airways that is associated with mucus hypersecretion and obstruction of small airways. Recently, it has emerged that exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) leads to an inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel, causing airway surface liquid dehydration, which may play a role in the development of chronic bronchitis. CS rapidly clears CFTR from the plasma membrane and causes it to be deposited into aggresome-like compartments. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) responsible for the internalization of CFTR following CS exposure. Our studies revealed that CS triggered a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ that may have emanated from lysosomes. Furthermore, chelation of cytoplasmic Ca2+, but not inhibition of protein kinases/phosphatases, prevented CS-induced CFTR internalization. The macrolide antibiotic bafilomycin A1 inhibited CS-induced Ca2+ release and prevented CFTR clearance from the plasma membrane, further linking cytoplasmic Ca2+ and CFTR internalization. We hypothesize that CS-induced Ca2+ release prevents normal sorting/degradation of CFTR and causes internalized CFTR to reroute to aggresomes.

https://openalex.org/W2071937747,"TLR4 signaling induces down-regulation of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI), which enhances TGF-β signaling during hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. We investigated the mechanism by which TLR4 signaling down-regulates BAMBI expression in HSCs and found that TLR4- and TNF-α-mediated BAMBI down-regulation is dependent on regulation of BAMBI promoter activity through the interaction with NF-κBp50 and HDAC1 in HSCs. Bambi was predominantly expressed in HSCs, at high levels in quiescent HSCs but at low levels in in vivo-activated and LPS-stimulated HSCs. In human HSCs, BAMBI expression was down-regulated in response to LPS and TNF-α. A BAMBI reporter assay demonstrated that the regulatory element to repress BAMBI transcription is located between 3384 and 1560 bp upstream from the transcription start site. LPS stimulation down-regulated BAMBI expression in cells with NF-κBp65 knockdown. However, it failed to down-regulate BAMBI in cells with inactivation of NF-κB or NF-κBp50 silencing, indicating that NF-κBp50 is a factor for BAMBI down-regulation. ChIP analysis revealed that LPS and TNF-α induced binding of the NF-κBp50/p50 homodimer to the BAMBI promoter region. We also found that HDAC1 is bound to this region as part of the NF-κBp50-HDAC1 complex, repressing transcriptional activity of the BAMBI promoter. Finally, we confirmed that LPS does not repress BAMBI reporter activity using a BAMBI reporter construct with a mutation at 3166 bp upstream of the coding region. In summary, our study demonstrates that LPS- and TNF-α-induced NF-κBp50-HDAC1 interaction represses BAMBI transcriptional activity, which contributes to TLR4-mediated enhancement of TGF-β signaling in HSCs during liver fibrosis.

Liver fibrosis and its end stage, cirrhosis, are major public health problems worldwide. Cirrhosis causes life-threatening complications such as portal hypertension and liver failure and increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (1Lee U.E. Friedman S.L.

Cirrhosis resulting from chronic liver inflammation, and fibrosis is characterized by the deposition of excessive extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen fibers and regenerative nodules (4De Minicis S.

In the past decade, notable advances have been made toward a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, moving closer to the treatment of liver fibrosis. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 2The abbreviations used are:HSChepatic stellate cellBAMBIBMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitorBMPbone morphogenic proteinhHSChuman hepatic stellate celllucluciferaseAbantibodyAdadenovirusIκBsrIκB superrepressorHDAChistone deacetylaseqPCRquantitative PCRTSAtrichostatin A. is a crucial step in the development of liver fibrosis. Therefore, the HSC is an attractive target for the development of new antifibrotic drugs (5Friedman S.L. Stellate cells. A moving target in hepatic fibrogenesis.Hepatology. 2004; 40: 1041-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). hepatic stellate cell BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor bone morphogenic protein human hepatic stellate cell luciferase antibody adenovirus IκB superrepressor histone deacetylase quantitative PCR trichostatin A. We have reported previously that TLR4 enhances TGF-β signaling in HSCs, HSC activation, and hepatic fibrosis (6Seki E. De, Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. TLR4 enhances TGF-β signaling and hepatic fibrosis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). TLR4-mutant mice had a significant reduction in liver fibrosis upon bile duct ligation and chronic carbon tetrachloride treatment compared with their respective wild-type controls. We showed that HSCs express high levels of TLR4 in the quiescent and activated states and that LPS, a TLR4 ligand, directly activates TLR4-dependent signaling pathways. LPS stimulation alone was insufficient to activate HSCs, but pretreatment with LPS enhanced the response of HSCs to profibrogenic cytokine TGF-β. We identified that the TGF-β pseudoreceptor, BAMBI, is the only TGF-β-related gene changed among 121 LPS-regulated genes in HSCs by gene profiling analysis. TGF-β is the best characterized fibrogenic mediator, and BAMBI is a functional inhibitor for the TGF-β receptor. The loss of BAMBI expression could amplify fibrogenic signaling. Thus, BAMBI plays a role in liver inflammation and fibrogenesis (7Luedde T. Trautwein C. A molecular link between inflammation and fibrogenesis.

A deer in the headlights. BAMBI meets liver fibrosis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1281-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which BAMBI is down-regulated in HSCs is unclear. This study demonstrates that BAMBI mRNA decreases in response to LPS and TNF-α in the human HSC cell line and primary HSCs. We found that the LPS and TNF-α-induced NF-κBp50 homodimer, in association with HDAC1, contributes to transcriptional repression of BAMBI expression in HSCs. The human HSC cell line LX-2 was provided by Dr. Scott Friedman (Mount Sinai Medical School, New York, NY) and cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. Primary human HSCs (hHSCs) were isolated from wedge sections of normal human liver tissue unsuitable for transplantation by collagenase-Pronase digestion and centrifugation on Nicodenz gradients. The procedures used for cell isolation and characterization have been described extensively elsewhere (9Schwabe R.F. Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Human hepatic stellate cells express CCR5 and RANTES to induce proliferation and migration.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver. Physiol. 2003; 285: G949-G958Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). hHSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, subcultured when confluent at a 1:3 split ratio, and used between passages 4 and 7. The procedures involving human materials were approved by the Investigational Review Board of the University of California San Diego. LPS (Sigma; Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5), recombinant human TNF-α (R&D Systems), and trichostatin A (TSA) (catalog no. T8552, Sigma) were used in this study. The antibodies used for the ChIP assay, Western blot analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation are p50 (catalog no. sc-8414x), HDAC1 (catalog no. sc-7872x), BAMBI (catalog no. sc-100681), and P-Smad2/3 (catalog no. sc-11769), all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. siRNA p50 (catalog no. sc-29407), siRNA HDAC1 (catalog no. sc-29343), siRNA p65, siRNA BAMBI (catalog no. sc-60243), and control siRNA (catalog no. sc-36869) were also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Lipofectamine 2000 transfection regent was purchased from Invitrogen. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (catalog no. E1910) was purchased from Promega. The BAMBI reporter constructs −3384/+82-luc, −1560/+82-luc, −1016/+82-luc, −586/+82-luc, −255/+82-luc, and −176/+82-luc were provided by Dr. Akiyama (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) (10Sekiya T.

Commun. 2004; 320: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mutation was introduced to the κB binding site of the BAMBI promoter. GGG in the BAMBI promoter were converted to CTC using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The adenovirus NF-κB supersuppressor expression construct has been described previously (6Seki E. De, Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. TLR4 enhances TGF-β signaling and hepatic fibrosis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). For luciferase assays, the human HSC cell line LX-2 was transfected with the BAMBI reporter-driven firefly luciferase plasmid and control reporter-driven Renilla luciferase by Lipofectamine 2000. LX2 cells were plated on 24-well plates 18 h prior to transfection. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Six hours after transfection of reporter plasmids, LX-2 cells were stimulated with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) and TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 18 h. The cells were washed twice in PBS and then lysed in passive lysis buffer for 15 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. A luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system following the protocol of the manufacturer and measured in a microplate luminometer (Veritas, Turner Biosystems). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The BAMBI promoter sequences were obtained from Ensembl. We used rVista2.0. to analyze the BAMBI promoter sequence for their predicted transcription factor binding sites. siRNA transfection was done according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The control (scrambled) siRNA and NF-κBp50 siRNA, p65 siRNA, HDAC1 siRNA, and BAMBI siRNA were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 at a final concentration of 80 pmol/liter in medium. mRNA and protein expression was determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis using a specific antibody to p50, p65, HDAC1, and BAMBI to confirm the significant reduction of p50, p65, HDAC1, and BAMBI 72 h after transfection. Total RNA was extracted from LX2 and primary hHSCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification was conducted in 10 μl of solution containing 3 μl of cDNA, 5 μl of SYBR mixture, 1.6 μl of H2O, and 0.4 μl of primer (10 μm). The primers used were as follows: hBAMBI, 5′-GGCAGCATCACAGTAGCATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATCGCCACTCCAGCTACAT-3′ (reverse); 18 S rRNA, 5′-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGATCCGAGGGCCTCACTA-3′ (reverse). Amplification steps consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 55 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 40 s using a DNA cycler (Bio Rad) CFX96 real-time system. Cell samples were collected in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was measured using a BCA commercial kit (Thermo). Protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science) were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk buffer and incubated with antibodies against human pSmad2/3. Secondary antibody was used for chemiluminescent detection. The loading accuracy was evaluated by monoclonal antibodies against β-actin. Cross-linking was performed by adding 1% formaldehyde directly into plates of cultured cells, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected, and pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min to lyse the nuclei. Then they were further sonicated to obtain 200- to 500-bp fragments of chromatin. Immunoprecipitation was carried out according to the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, chromatin was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer. A small amount of chromatin was kept aside at this step to be used as an input control in subsequent PCR reactions. Antibodies p50 (catalog no. sc-8414x) and HDAC1 (catalog no. sc-7872x) were incubated with diluted chromatin at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitation was also carried out with normal IgG Ab. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) blocked with sheared salmon sperm DNA was used to collect Ab-chromatin complexes. Immune complexes were then washed once with low-salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 150 mm NaCl), once with high-salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and 150 mm NaCl), once with LiCl immune complex wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)), and twice with sterile Tris-EDTA buffer. The chromatin was eluted with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3), followed by reverse cross-linking with 0.3 m NaCl at 65 °C overnight. DNA was then recovered by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, followed by PCR amplification. The PCR conditions used were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C (30 s), 58 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (30 s). The primers used to amplify the BAMBI promoter for the −3166 κB binding site were 5′-gtttctttgggttgcaagga-3′ and 5′-cacctgtctgcagaggaaga-3′. For immunoprecipitation of p50 and HDAC1, LX2 cells were grown in 15-cm dishes to 85% confluence. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and collected. The samples were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Then the samples were shaken for 40 min at 4 °C to lyse the protein completely. After lysis, the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The extracts were precleared with a 50% Sepharose A slurry (Millipore) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of either the p50 polyclonal antibody (catalog no. sc-8414x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or HDAC1 (catalog no. sc-7872x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody. Antibody-protein complexes were collected with the 50% Sepharose A slurry, washed, and then boiled in sample buffer to remove the antibody-protein complex from the protein A slurry. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Differences between two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U test or two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Differences between multiple groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). p <0.05 was considered significant. We initially investigated the responsible cell types expressing Bambi in mouse liver. As shown in Fig. 1A, Bambi mRNA was expressed at higher levels in HSCs than in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Among different activation states of HSCs, Bambi mRNA decreased to a low level in in vivo-activated HSCs isolated from mice after bile duct ligation and chronic CCl4 treatment and in LPS-treated quiescent HSCs but not in culture-activated HSCs (Fig. 1B), suggesting that TLR4-mediated Bambi down-regulation is crucial for HSC activation in vivo. Next, we investigated whether BAMBI mRNA expression can be down-regulated in a human HSC cell line and in primary human HSCs in response to LPS or TNF-α. BAMBI mRNA was down-regulated 0.4- to 0.5-fold in LX2 cells in response to LPS and TNF-α compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1C). More dramatically, BAMBI mRNA decreased 0.21-fold in hHSCs in response to LPS compared with untreated hHSCs (Fig. 1D). Quiescent HSCs express BAMBI at high levels, and LPS stimulation down-regulates BAMBI mRNA expression. To characterize the crucial elements for repression in the BAMBI promoter region after LPS and TNF-α stimulation, LX2 cells were transfected with hBAMBI promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids containing the hBAMBI transcriptional start site, the complete 82-bp untranslated region, and the 3384 region upstream of the coding region. The promoter activity analysis showed that the relative luciferase activity in the −3384 + 82-luc construct decreased significantly (p < 0.001) with LPS or TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the relative luciferase activity in shorter deletion constructs was not reduced by either LPS or TNF-α stimulation. Luciferase activity in the −176 + 82-luc construct was significantly lower than that of longer constructs in untreated cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the regulatory element for repression of BAMBI transcription is located between −3384 and −1560 upstream from the BAMBI coding region and that the BAMBI promoter region between −255 and −176 is responsible for constitutive expression of BAMBI in hHSCs. Because both TNF-α and LPS are strong activators of NF-κB, we hypothesized that NF-κB binds to a specific element on the BAMBI promoter region that is associated with the suppression of BAMBI gene transcription. We assessed the contribution of NF-κB activation to BAMBI repression by using an adenovirus that expresses an IκB superrepressor (IκBsr), a potent and specific inhibitor of NF-κB activation (6Seki E. De, Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. TLR4 enhances TGF-β signaling and hepatic fibrosis.Nat.

In the presence of the NF-κB inhibitor adenovirus (Ad)-IκBsr, we observed the BAMBI mRNA levels after LPS and TNF-α treatment to be approximately equivalent to that of the untreated levels in both LX2 cells and hHSCs (Fig. 3, A–D), suggesting that NF-κB activation participates in BAMBI gene down-regulation. To determine which subunit of NF-κB is associated with BAMBI down-regulation in HSCs, we selectively inhibited p50 and p65 translation using p50- and p65-specific siRNA (Fig. 3, E and F). We stimulated p50 and p65 knockdown LX2 cells or control siRNA-transfected LX2 cells with LPS and TNF-α and measured BAMBI mRNA (Fig. 3, E and F). In LX2 cells transfected with control siRNAs, LPS and TNF-α stimulation induced a 50–60% reduction of BAMBI mRNA expression compared with untreated LX2 cells (Fig. 3, E and F). The LPS-treated, p50-silenced LX2 cells showed similar levels of BAMBI mRNA as untreated cells (Fig. 3E). Of note, BAMBI mRNA was still reduced by LPS and TNF- α in p65-silenced LX2 cells (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that NF-κBp50, but not the p65 subunit, is required for the suppression of LPS- and TNF-α-induced down-regulation of BAMBI mRNA expression in LX2 cells. Given that the NF-κBp50 subunit participates in BAMBI mRNA down-regulation in response to LPS and TNF-α, we investigated whether p50 is directly involved in BAMBI promoter activity using siRNA for p50 and BAMBI −3384/+82-luc. The relative luciferase activity was decreased in control siRNA-transfected LX2 cells in response to LPS and TNF-α (Fig. 3G). However, the relative luciferase activity did not decrease in LX2 cells transfected with siRNA for p50 in response to LPS and TNF-α treatment compared with cells transfected with p50 siRNA without LPS or TNF-α treatment. It has been reported that the p50 homodimer negatively regulates gene expression (11Cao S. Zhang X. Edwards J.P. Mosser D.M.

Our data strongly support the capability of the NF-κBp50 homodimer to suppress the BAMBI gene transcription upon LPS and TNF-α treatment. Sequence analysis of the human BAMBI promoter (-3384 to −1560) predicted two regions as p50-binding sites (Fig. 3H). ChIP analysis of the promoter using primers for these two regions showed that NF-κBp50 binds to the −3166 region (Fig. 3I). In LX2 cells and hHSCs, LPS and TNF-α stimulation increased p50 binding to the −3166 binding site (Fig. 3I) compared with untreated cells. However, p50 recruitment was decreased in Ad-IκBsr-infected cells in response to LPS and TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 3J), indicating that LPS and TNF-α induce p50 binding to the BAMBI promoter region. It has been reported previously that NF-κBp50 associates with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) that inhibits gene expression (14Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Verdin E. Greene W.C. NF-κB p50 promotes HIV latency through HDAC recruitment and repression of transcriptional initiation.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 15Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. The phosphorylation status of nuclear NF-κB determines its association with CBP/p300 or HDAC-1.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 16Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. The p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB interacts with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressors HDAC1 and HDAC2 to negatively regulate gene expression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether HDAC1 participates in BAMBI mRNA regulation. When we knocked down HDAC1 in LX2 cells, the expression of BAMBI mRNA did not decrease in response to LPS and TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that HDAC1 is associated with BAMBI down-regulation in response to LPS and TNF-α stimulation. To identify whether HDAC1 binding to p50 contributes to BAMBI gene regulation, we carried out a ChIP analysis using anti-HDAC1 antibody directed at the −3166 κB-binding site. We observed that LPS and TNF-α stimulation led to higher HDAC1 binding to this κB-binding site of the BAMBI promoter in LX2 cells and hHSCs (Fig. 4C). Treatment with the HDAC1 inhibitor TSA inhibited LPS- or TNF-α-induced HDAC1 binding to the BAMBI promoter (Fig. 4D). As expected, LPS- or TNF-α-induced HDAC1 binding to the BAMBI promoter was also inhibited when NF-κB activation was inhibited in LX2 cells infected with Ad-IκBsr (Fig. 4E), indicating that NF-κB activation is required for binding of HDAC1 to the BAMBI promoter. Interestingly, TSA treatment prevented LPS- or TNF-α-induced binding of NF-κBp50 to the BAMBI promoter (Fig. 4F), suggesting that the HDAC1 activity is also required for NF-κBp50 binding to the BAMBI promoter. Finally, we tested the direct interaction between HDAC1 and NF-κBp50 by coimmunoprecipitation. This confirmed the interaction of HDAC1 with p50 in LX2 cells after LPS or TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 4G). To further validate NF-κBp50 and BAMBI promoter interaction at the −3166 κB site, we created luciferase constructs of BAMBI with a mutated −3166 κB site (Fig. 5A). A luciferase reporter assay revealed that LPS and TNF-α-induced suppression of BAMBI reporter activity was not observed in cells transfected with BAMBI reporter constructs with a mutation at the −3166 site, indicating the importance of the −3166 binding κB site for the down-regulation of gene expression. As expected, TGF-β treatment increased phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in LX2 cells (Fig. 6A). In the context of down-regulation of BAMBI, LPS and TNF-α treatment further increased TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in LX2 cells (Fig. 6A). Also, TGF-β-induced COL1A1 expression was further enhanced by pretreatment with LPS or TNF-α (Fig. 6B) in control adenovirus-infected LX2 cells. Consistently, inhibition of NF-κB decreased the enhancement of TGF-β-induced COL1A1 expression by pretreatment with LPS and TNF-α (Fig. 6B), suggesting that NF-κB-mediated BAMBI down-regulation is associated with LPS or TNF-α-mediated enhancement of TGF-β-induced COL1A1 expression. Lastly, we investigated the biological function of BAMBI in TGF-β signaling in human LX-2 HSC. TGF-β increased COL1A1 mRNA expression in control siRNA-transfected LX2 cells (Fig. 6C). COL1A1 mRNA was further increased after TGF-β stimulation in cells transfected with siRNA for BAMBI, confirming that BAMBI is a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling in human HSCs. Liver fibrosis is a complex pathological entity in which multiple components, including various proinflammatory cytokines and fibrotic matrix proteins, participate actively (17Wynn T.A. Ramalingam T.R. Mechanisms of fibrosis. Therapeutic translation for fibrotic disease.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 1028-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). There is overwhelming evidence that activated HSCs are the major producers of the fibrotic matrix (1Lee U.E. Friedman S.L. Mechanisms of hepatic fibrogenesis.Best. Pract. Res. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2011; 25: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 2Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin.

CX3CL1-CX3CR1 interaction prevents carbon tetrachloride-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis in mice.Hepatology. 2010; 52: 1390-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). TGF-β is the key cytokine that mediates HSC activation, but the current model of TGF-β-dependent HSC activation does not account for the contribution of inflammatory mediators to hepatic fibrogenesis (6Seki E. De, Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. TLR4 enhances TGF-β signaling and hepatic fibrosis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar), and extensive studies are aimed to establish a mechanistic link between inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disease (6Seki E. De, Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. TLR4 enhances TGF-β signaling and hepatic fibrosis.Nat.

Kupffer cells are associated with apoptosis, inflammation and fibrotic effects in hepatic fibrosis in rats.Lab. Invest. 2010; 90: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that BAMBI links inflammation and liver fibrosis via TLR4-dependent modification of TGF-β signaling in HSC. BAMBI plays an important role in HSC activation. However, the mechanism of the regulation of BAMBI gene expression was unknown. In this study, we determined the molecular mechanism of BAMBI down-regulation in response to LPS and TNF-α stimulation in human HSCs. We demonstrated that BAMBI is mainly expressed in HSCs but not Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. TLR4 and TNF receptor signaling induce NF-κBp50 homodimer/HDAC1 binding to the −3166 site in the BAMBI promoter to down-regulate gene transcription. BAMBI is a transmembrane glycoprotein structurally related to the TGF-β type I receptor, but it lacks the intracellular kinase domain (19Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massagué J. Niehrs C. Silencing of TGF-β signalling by the pseudoreceptor BAMBI.Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Several investigators have recognized the important role of BAMBI in recent years. BAMBI protects the murine heart from pressure overload biomechanical stress by restraining TGF-β signaling (20Villar A.V. García R. Llano M. Cobo M. Merino D. Lantero A. Tramullas M. Hurlé J.M. Hurlé M.A. Nistal J.F. BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor) protects the murine heart from pressure-overload biomechanical stress by restraining TGF-β signaling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1832: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). BAMBI has also been reported as a negative regulator of adipogenesis and modulator of the anti- and proadipogenic effects of TGF-β (21Luo X. Hutley L.J. Webster J.A. Kim Y.H. Liu D.F. Newell F.S. Widberg C.H. Bachmann A. Turner N. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Prins J.B. Yang G.S. Whitehead J.P. Identification of BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) as a potent negative regulator of adipogenesis and modulator of autocrine/paracrine adipogenic factors.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). BAMBI blocks the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts via inhibition of TGF-β signaling (22Shangguan L. Ti X. Krause U. Hai B. Zhao Y. Yang Z. Liu F. Inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling by BAMBI blocks differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and abolishes their protumor effects.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). BAMBI is coexpressed with TGF-β receptor family members during development and in cancer. It has been proposed that BAMBI may play a role in embryonic development (23Grotewold L. Plum M. Dildrop R. Peters T. Rüther U. Bambi is co-expressed with Bmp-4 during mouse embryogenesis.Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in tumor growth and metastasis (24Sekiya T. Adachi S. Kohu K. Yamada T. Higuchi O. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura T.

Identification of BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI), an inhibitor of transforming growth factor-β signaling, as a target of the β-catenin pathway in colorectal tumor cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6840-6846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Elevation of BAMBI expression may attenuate TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas (25Yan X. Lin Z. Chen F. Zhao X. Chen H. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. Human BAMBI cooperates with Smad7 to inhibit transforming growth factor-β signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30097-30104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and induction of cell growth and invasion of human gastric cancer (26Fritzmann J. Morkel M. Besser D. Budczies J. Kosel F. Brembeck F.H. Stein U. Fichtner I. Schlag P.M. Birchmeier W. A colorectal cancer expression profile that includes transforming growth factor β inhibitor BAMBI predicts metastatic potential.Gastroenterology. 2009; 137: 165-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although BAMBI plays an important physiological and pathological role in the liver, heart, and cancer, its transcriptional regulation has not been studied intensively. Previous reports showed that BAMBI transcription is regulated by TGF-β signaling through direct binding of SMAD3 and SMAD4 to the BAMBI promoter in HepG2 cells (10Sekiya T. Oda T. Matsuura K. Akiyama T. Transcriptional regulation of the TGF-β pseudoreceptor BAMBI by TGF-β signaling.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, our results showed that BAMBI is expressed in HSCs but not in hepatocytes. NF-κB is a critical transcription factor induced by inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α and LPS (27Hatano E. Bennett B.L. Manning A.M. Qian T. Lemasters J.J. Brenner D.A. NF-κB stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase to protect mouse hepatocytes from TNF-α- and Fas-mediated apoptosis.Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1251-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that inhibition of NF-κB prevented LPS and TNF-α from inhibiting BAMBI expression, suggesting that NF-κB participates in BAMBI down-regulation in human HSCs. In fact, BAMBI mRNA levels, in response to LPS and TNF-α, were slightly higher in Ad-IκBsr-treated cells compared with untreated cells, suggesting that BAMBI might be constitutively transcribed independently of NF-κB or be regulated at the posttranscriptional level (28Xavier S. Gilbert V. Rastaldi M.P. Krick S. Kollins D. Reddy A. Bottinger E. Cohen C.D. Schlondorff D. BAMBI is expressed in endothelial cells and is regulated by lysosomal/autolysosomal degradation.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The stability of mRNA is regulated by degradation and, in part, by specific proteins binding to defined adenylate-uridylate-rich base sequences in the 3′ UTR. Our luciferase activity analysis showed that the relative luciferase activity decreased after LPS stimulation with transfection of a pBAMBI-3′ UTR reporter plasmid, 3C. Liu, D. A. Brenner, and E. Seki, unpublished observations. suggesting that other mechanisms, such as miRNA, also participate in the regulation of BAMBI expression. Different forms of NF-κB are known to have distinct functions in the inflammatory response (29O'Hara S.P. Splinter P.L. Gajdos G.B. Trussoni C.E. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Chen X.M. LaRusso N.F. NF-κB p50-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ)-mediated transcriptional repression of microRNA let-7i following microbial infection.J. Biol.

Inactivation of NF-κB p50 leads to insulin sensitization in liver through post-translational inhibition of p70S6K.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18368-18376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The most abundant form of NF-κB in cells is a heterodimer of the p50 and p65 subunits. Our results showed that BAMBI mRNA still decreased after knocking down NF-κBp65, indicating that the NF-κBp65/p50 heterodimer is not important for BAMBI down-regulation in human HSCs in response to LPS and TNF-α treatment. This was also demonstrated by ChIP analysis. In contrast, when knocking down p50, BAMBI mRNA levels were protected from LPS or TNF-α stimulation, suggesting that the p50 homodimer, but not the p65/p50 heterodimer, participates in BAMBI repression by LPS or TNF-α. Generally, low levels of NF-κB, particularly the p50 homodimer, can be detected in the nuclei of most unstimulated cells. Following stimulation, the p50/p65 heterodimer containing phosphorylated p65 enters the nucleus and displaces the DNA-bound p50 homodimer (14Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Verdin E. Greene W.C. NF-κB p50 promotes HIV latency through HDAC recruitment and repression of transcriptional initiation.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, our ChIP analysis showed that LPS and TNF-α increased p50 binding to the BAMBI promoter region. It is probable that the different κB sites exhibit a preference for specific subsets of NF-κB complexes (31Baer M. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Sedon C. Nedospasov S. Johnson P.F. Tumor necrosis factor α transcription in macrophages is attenuated by an autocrine factor that preferentially induces NF-κB p50.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5678-5689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, the regulatory region of the IL-8 gene contains a κB element that binds p65, c-Rel, and the p52 homodimer but not the p50 homodimer or p50/p65 heterodimer (32Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. NF-κ B subunit-specific regulation of the interleukin-8 promoter.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, induction of the ICAM-1 gene occurs in response to inflammatory signals, such as TNF-α, that act through an NF-κB site in the proximal promoter region. This site binds only the p65 homodimer and p50/p65 heterodimer (33Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. Transcriptional regulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene by inflammatory cytokines in human endothelial cells. Essential roles of a variant NF-κ B site and p65 homodimers.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). p65 homodimer appears to be the transcriptionally active NF-κB complex for the ICAM-1 promoter, suggesting that p50/p65 may be excluded from binding (33Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. Transcriptional regulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene by inflammatory cytokines in human endothelial cells. Essential roles of a variant NF-κ B site and p65 homodimers.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the p50 homodimer inhibits gene expression is unknown, although it is unlikely that p50 subunits are intrinsically incapable to drive transcription. One possible mechanism is that nuclear p50 may interact with inhibitory proteins that recruit corepressor complexes containing HDACs to gene promoters (15Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. The phosphorylation status of nuclear NF-κB determines its association with CBP/p300 or HDAC-1.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Our experiments depleting HDAC1 and using TSA strongly suggest that the activity of HDAC1 maintains the transcriptional repression through a p50-HDAC1 complex because inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA blocks the repression of BAMBI mRNA expression. This is also supported by our ChIP analysis demonstrating that inhibition of HDAC1 activity by TSA treatment blocks HDAC1 binding to the promoter region induced by LPS and TNF-α. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-κB activation or silencing of p50 by siRNA inhibited HDAC1 binding to p50 and the BAMBI promoter region, indicating that NF-κB activation is required for the formation of the p50-HDAC1 complex (15Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. The phosphorylation status of nuclear NF-κB determines its association with CBP/p300 or HDAC-1.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC1 activity by TSA treatment decreased p50 binding to the BAMBI promoter region, suggesting that HDAC1 activity is required for the formation of the p50-HDAC1 complex and binding of this complex to the BAMBI promoter region. In summary, BAMBI is predominantly expressed in HSCs in the liver. TNF-α or LPS stimulation generates an NF-κBp50 homodimer that interacts with HDAC1 to repress BAMBI transcription in human HSCs, which, in turn, increases the sensitivity to TGF-β signaling."

Enzymes characterized as cellulases are found in 17 families of the classification initiated in 1991 by Henrissat et al. (3Henrissat B. Claeyssens M. Tomme P. Lemesle L. Mornon J.P. Cellulase families revealed by hydrophobic cluster analysis.Gene. 1989; 81: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In contrast to family-5, some families like family-9 and -48 are more homogeneous in terms of specificities because they almost exclusively contain cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4, EC 3.2.1.91, and EC 3.2.1.176). Indeed, 13 of the 14 GH48 enzymes characterized to date were described as cellulases, and only one as a chitinase. Similarly, the 132 characterized GH9 enzymes (out of the 1,525 sequences classified in family 9) were identified as cellulases except for one enzyme from Photobacterium profundum that was found to be more active on chito-oligosaccharides than on cellodextrins (4Honda Y.

Naturally, many GH9 cellulases also display side activities on related polysaccharides such as β1,3–1,4-glycans (5Arai T. Araki R. Tanaka A. Karita S. Kimura T. Sakka K. Ohmiya K.

In addition to their catalytic domains, a large proportion of known GH9 enzymes contain ancillary modules/domains like carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) (8Gal L. Gaudin C. Belaich A. Pages S.

GH9-encoding genes are widespread among cellulolytic microorganisms (except aerobic fungi) and plants, but the genes coding this family of enzymes are particularly abundant in anaerobic bacteria producing cellulosomes. The cellulosomes are heterogeneous large extracellular complexes that efficiently degrade cellulose and related plant cell wall polysaccharides. The simplest cellulosomes such as those produced by mesophilic and cellulolytic clostridia are composed of a single major scaffolding protein hosting a CBM displaying affinity for cellulose and a series of cohesin modules that strongly interact with a complementary module, the dockerin, borne by the catalytic subunits. In other cellulolytic bacteria, such as Clostridium thermocellum and rumen bacteria, several interacting scaffoldins are synthesized, and different types of specific cohesin/dockerin devices are used to assemble and attach to the cell surface these intricate cellulosomes (13Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. Cellulosomes: highly efficient nanomachines designed to deconstruct plant cell wall complex carbohydrates.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 655-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The genome of cellulosome-producing bacteria usually contains only one or two genes coding for a cellulosomal GH48 enzyme, whereas GH9-encoding genes are plethoric. Thus, 15, 13, 8, and 12 genes that putatively encode cellulosomal (i.e. appended with a dockerin) GH9 were discovered in the sequenced genomes of C. thermocellum (DSM 1313) (14Feinberg L. Foden J.

Furthermore, one or few genes encoding noncellulosomal GH9 were also found in these bacterial genomes. In the case of C. cellulolyticum, the 12 GH9-encoding genes would account for 70% of the genes predicted to code for cellulosomal cellulases. Moreover, former studies (16Blouzard J.C. Coutinho P.M.

This observation indicates that all dockerin-bearing GH9 enzymes are recurrent components of the cellulosomes, in contrast to other cellulosomal catalytic subunits whose synthesis and participation to the cellulosomes are substrate-dependent (16Blouzard J.C.

As for other cellulolytic clostridia, only few C. cellulolyticum GH9 enzymes displaying very different organizations were selected to date for characterization. Thus, Cel9G (8Gal L. Gaudin C.

In this study, the multiplicity and the diversity of GH9 enzymes in bacterial cellulosomes were investigated by overproducing, purifying, and establishing the catalytic properties of all uncharacterized GH9 enzymes from C. cellulolyticum. Their contribution to cellulosome efficiency was evaluated using the cellulosome chimera technology by complexation of the GH9 enzymes with pivotal cellulosomal cellulases onto hybrid scaffoldins. The sole noncellulosomal GH9 of C. cellulolyticum was also studied, as well as an engineered form of this enzyme displaying a dockerin module. Genomic DNA from C. cellulolyticum ATCC 35319 served as template for amplification by PCR of the DNA encoding the mature form of the various GH9s. A list of primers used in this study is provided in supplemental Table 1. The amplicons were cloned in pET28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) at NcoI/XhoI sites, except for the gene encoding Cel9R which was cloned in pET23(+) at NheI/XhoI sites. In all cases, six His codons were introduced at the 3′ extremity of the coding sequence. Positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. The BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Novagen) was used as production strain.

The BL21(DE3) overproducing the various GH9 enzymes were grown in 2.5-liter toxin flasks at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with glycerol (12 g/liter) and the appropriate antibiotic until A600 = 1.5–2. To prevent the formation of inclusion bodies, the cultures were then cooled down, and induction of the expression was performed overnight at 16 °C with 50 μm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside for the strains BL21(DE3) carrying pET28a-Cel9H, pET28a-Cel9J, pET28a-Cel9Q, pET28a-Cel9T, pET23a-Cel9R, pET28a-Cel9X, and pET28a-Cel9V and 80 μm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside for the strains containing the vectors pET28a-Cel9W and pET28a-Cel9Wc, and 100 μm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside for the strain carrying pET28a-Cel9P and pET28a-Cel9U. After 16 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 15 min) and resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, supplemented with a few milligrams of DNase I (Roche Applied Science), and broken in a French press. The crude extract was centrifuged 15 min at 10,000 × g and loaded on 2–5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Vanloo, The Netherlands) equilibrated in the same buffer. The proteins of interest were then eluted with 100 mm imidazole in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2. The purification of the recombinant proteins was achieved on Q-Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2. The proteins of interest were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2. In the case of Cel9Vc, an alternative purification procedure was also used. After the first purification step on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, the fraction containing the protein of interest was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 2 ml, and purification was achieved by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl. The purified proteins were dialyzed by ultrafiltration against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of the proteins was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, using the program ProtParam tool.

Interacting protein components (enzymes bearing a dockerin and scaffoldin) were mixed at a final concentration of 10 μm at room temperature in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 4 μl were subjected to PAGE (4–15% gradient) using a Phastsystem apparatus (GE Healthcare). In the case of Scaf6-based heterogeneous mixtures with variable GH9 enzyme occupying the C. cellulolyticum cohesin, each of the 11 GH9 enzymes (bearing a C. cellulolyticum dockerin) was at final concentration of 0.91 μm, whereas Scaf6, the cellulase appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin (Cel48Ft), and the cellulase hosting a Ruminococcus flavefaciens dockerin (Cel9Gf) were at 10 μm. Hydrolytic activity on soluble polysaccharides like carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) medium viscosity, laminarin (Sigma), arabinan (sugar beet), and xyloglucan (Megazyme, Wiclow, Ireland) was determined by mixing 4 ml of substrate solution at 10 g/liter (CMC) or 3.5 g/liter (laminarin, arabinan, and xyloglucan) in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (w/v) azide with 40 μl of an appropriate dilution of enzyme (final enzyme concentration ranging from 1 to 100 nm) at 37 °C.

Released sugars were in some cases also analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) (see below). Phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) was prepared as described previously (24Wood T.M.

One IU corresponds to 1 μmol of pNP (using pNP from Sigma as the standard) released per min. Kinetics on cellodextrins ranging from cellobiose to cellohexaose were performed by incubating at 37 °C 10 μl of enzyme (1 μm) with 90 μl of substrate at 1.11 mm in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide. Samples (20 μl) were extracted at specific intervals and analyzed by HPAEC-PAD. HPAEC-PAD analyses of the released soluble sugars were performed in a Dionex ICS 3000 (Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector. 200 μl of sample (or 10 times diluted sample in distilled water) were mixed with 50 μl of 0.5 m NaOH, and 25 μl were applied to a Dionex CarboPac PA1 column (4 × 250 mm) preceded by the corresponding guard column (4 × 50 mm). Sugars were eluted with the buffers 0.1 m NaOH and 0.5 m sodium acetate + 0.1 m NaOH as the eluants A and B, respectively, using for cellodextrins the multistep procedure as follows: isochratic separation (5 min, 95% A + 5% B), separation gradient (8 min, 10–37% B), column wash (2 min, 99% B), and subsequent column equilibration (2.5 min, 95% A + 5% B). For analysis of xyloglucan dextrins, the same A and B buffers were used, but a multistep procedure was as follows: isochratic separation (5 min, 95% A + 5% B), separation gradient (25.5 min, 10–99% B), column wash (2 min, 99% B), and subsequent column equilibration (2.5 min, 95% A + 5% B).

The relative fluidity ΔF was determined as (To/(T − To)) − (To/(To′ − To)), where To, To′, and T correspond to the flow time of buffer, the flow time of CMC or xyloglucan solutions without enzyme, and the flow time of substrate with enzyme, respectively. In parallel, the reducing sugars content of the samples was determined using the Park and Johnson method (23Park J.T. Johnson M.J. A submicrodetermination of glucose.J. Biol.

The suspension was subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C (10,000 × g), and the supernatant was collected. Ten μl of supernatant were mixed with 5 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The cellulose-containing pellet was subsequently washed twice with 200 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, resuspended in 200 μl of diluted loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The sample was again centrifuged 10 min at 4 °C (10,000 × g), and the supernatant was collected. Samples (first and last supernatants) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using precast gels 4–15% (Bio-Rad).

https://openalex.org/W2108690908,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an opportunistic, bacterial pathogen causing persistent and frequently fatal infections of the lung in patients with cystic fibrosis. Isolates from chronic infections differ from laboratory and environmental strains in a range of traits and this is widely interpreted as the result of adaptation to the lung environment. Typically, chronic strains carry mutations in global regulation factors that could effect reduced expression of social traits, raising the possibility that competitive dynamics between cooperative and selfish, cheating strains could also drive changes in P. aeruginosa infections. We compared the expression of cooperative traits - biofilm formation, secretion of exo-products and quorum sensing (QS) - in P. aeruginosa isolates that were estimated to have spent different lengths of time in the lung based on clinical information. All three exo-products involved in nutrient acquisition were produced in significantly smaller quantities with increased duration of infection, and patterns across four QS signal molecules were consistent with accumulation over time of mutations in lasR, which are known to disrupt the ability of cells to respond to QS signal. Pyocyanin production, and the proportion of cells in biofilm relative to motile, free-living cells in liquid culture, did not change. Overall, our results confirm that the loss of social behaviour is a consistent trend with time spent in the lung and suggest that social dynamics are potentially relevant to understanding the behaviour of P. aeruginosa in lung infections."
https://openalex.org/W1999442315,"The Doc toxin from bacteriophage P1 (of the phd-doc toxin-antitoxin system) has served as a model for the family of Doc toxins, many of which are harbored in the genomes of pathogens. We have shown previously that the mode of action of this toxin is distinct from the majority derived from toxin-antitoxin systems: it does not cleave RNA; in fact P1 Doc expression leads to mRNA stabilization. However, the molecular triggers that lead to translation arrest are not understood. The presence of a Fic domain, albeit slightly altered in length and at the catalytic site, provided a clue to the mechanism of P1 Doc action, as most proteins with this conserved domain inactivate GTPases through addition of an adenylyl group (also referred to as AMPylation). We demonstrated that P1 Doc added a single phosphate group to the essential translation elongation factor and GTPase, elongation factor (EF)-Tu. The phosphorylation site was at a highly conserved threonine, Thr-382, which was blocked when EF-Tu was treated with the antibiotic kirromycin. Therefore, we have established that Fic domain proteins can function as kinases. This distinct enzymatic activity exhibited by P1 Doc also solves the mystery of the degenerate Fic motif unique to the Doc family of toxins. Moreover, we have established that all characterized Fic domain proteins, even those that phosphorylate, target pivotal GTPases for inactivation through a post-translational modification at a single functionally critical acceptor site. The Doc toxin from bacteriophage P1 (of the phd-doc toxin-antitoxin system) has served as a model for the family of Doc toxins, many of which are harbored in the genomes of pathogens. We have shown previously that the mode of action of this toxin is distinct from the majority derived from toxin-antitoxin systems: it does not cleave RNA; in fact P1 Doc expression leads to mRNA stabilization. However, the molecular triggers that lead to translation arrest are not understood.

TA systems can be harbored in bacterial genomes, on extrachromosomal bacterial plasmids, or in bacteriophages. They are associated with, or implicated in, several clinically important phenomena: biofilm formation, bacterial persistence during antibiotic treatment, and bacterial pathogenesis (1Dawson C.C.

On plasmids, TA systems ensure maintenance through postsegregational killing. For example, after infection the bacteriophage P1 circularizes and enters either a lysogenic or lytic program (5Łobocka M.B. Rose D.J. Plunkett 3rd, G. Rusin M. Samojedny A. Lehnherr H.

The P1 phd-doc TA system comprising the Phd (prevents host death) antitoxin (8.1 kDa) and the Doc (death on curing) toxin (13.6 kDa) is involved in maintenance of the P1 prophage as a stable plasmid in response to environmental cues that direct the cell to the lysogenic state. P1 phd-doc has served as the model for the function of all phd-doc TA systems, many of which reside in the chromosomes of pathogens (6Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V.

By comparison, the consensus for the Fic motif in all Doc toxins is slightly different, HXFX(D/N)(A/G)NKR. Alterations to this motif can result in changes to the enzymatic activity of the protein. In the case of Doc, individual mutations within its Fic motif 66HIFNDANKRTAL77 (H66Y, H66R, D70N, and A76E) result in the loss of toxicity (13Magnuson R. Yarmolinsky M.B. Corepression of the P1 addiction operon by Phd and Doc.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6342-6351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of action of P1 Doc illuminates the function of the Doc family of toxins as a whole. Because many phd-doc TA systems are harbored in the genomes of pathogenic bacteria, they also serve as attractive antibiotic targets (23Williams J.J. Hergenrother P.J. Artificial activation of toxin-antitoxin systems as an antibacterial strategy.Trends Microbiol. 2012; 20: 291-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here we determined that Doc acts in a manner distinct from other characterized Fic domain proteins. Doc is a protein kinase that blocks translation elongation through phosphorylation of Thr-382 of the essential elongation factor EF-Tu. These studies are in agreement with those recently reported by Castro-Roa et al. (24Castro-Roa D. Garcia-Pino A. De Gieter S. van Nuland N.A. Loris R. Zenkin N. The Fic protein Doc uses an inverted substrate to phosphorylate and inactivate EF-Tu.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, we also demonstrated that phosphorylation of EF-Tu alone is sufficient for translation inhibition and that the antibiotic kirromycin prevents phosphorylation by Doc. Finally, our functional data are complemented with molecular models that inform the mechanism of kirromycin-mediated phosphorylation inhibition and provide alternate mechanisms for Doc toxin binding to EF-Tu. The Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) (F- ompT hsdSβ(rβ-mβ) dcm gal (DE3) tonA) (Novagen) and BW25113 (lacIq rrnBT14 Δlac-ZWJ16 hsdR514 ΔaraBADAH33 ΔrhaBADLD78) were used for all protein expression and toxicity studies. E. coli K-12 Mach1 T1 cells (ΔrecA1398 endA1 tonA Φ80ΔlacM15 ΔlacX74 hsdR(rk+mk+); Invitrogen) were used for all cloning experiments. The pBAD33-doc clone used in this work and our earlier publication (17Liu M. Zhang Y. Inouye M. Woychik N.A. Bacterial addiction module toxin Doc inhibits translation elongation through its association with the 30S ribosomal subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5885-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) contained the doc open reading frame as a PCR-amplified 5′BamHI/HindIII3′ fragment that was cloned into the corresponding sites of pET21c to create pET21c-doc. Plasmid pET21c-doc was digested with 5′XbaI/HindIII3′ and subcloned into pBAD33 to create pBAD33-doc (17Liu M. Zhang Y. Inouye M. Woychik N.A.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5885-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This cloning strategy yields relatively low expression levels of wild type doc. The docH66Y mutant was created by PCR-mediated mutagenesis with 5′BamHI/HindIII3′ ends and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET21c to create pET21c-docH66Y. pBAD33-docH66Y mutant plasmid was created after digestion of pET21c-docH66Y with 5′XbaI/HindIII3′ and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBAD33. The docH66Y open reading frame was PCR-amplified as an 5′NdeI/XhoI3′ fragment and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET21c to create pET21c-docH66Y. The phd open reading frame was PCR-amplified with 5′NdeI/XhoI3′ ends and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET21c to create pET21c-phd. tufAT382A was created by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and cloned into pET21c with 5′NdeI/XhoI3′ ends to create pET21c-tufAT382A. The DNA sequences of PCR fragments used for cloning were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. One liter of M9 liquid medium supplemented with 0.21% glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.001% (w/v) thiamine, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with pET21c-phd in BL21(DE3) and grown to an A600 of 0.9. The culture was induced with 1 mm IPTG and expressed for 4 h. Cells were subsequently disrupted by sonication and the proteins purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as recommended. EF-Tu was purified by New England Biolabs (NEB) in the absence of GDP and stored in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 7 mm β-ME, and 50% glycerol. pET21c-tufAT382A was transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells. Transformants were used to inoculate 500 ml of M9 liquid medium and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Expression of protein was induced by addition of 1 mm IPTG for 4 h. Cells were subsequently disrupted by sonication, and the protein extracts were applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column to purify the proteins as recommended by Qiagen. BL21 Gold (DE3) pLysS cells (Agilent) containing pET21c-phd-doc were grown at 37 °C in M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids, 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.001% (w/v) thiamine, and 200 μg/ml ampicillin. At A600 of 0.5–0.7, expression was induced with 0.4 mm IPTG for 3 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation and ruptured by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-ME, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.1% Triton X-100. The sonicated mixture was subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the Phd-Doc-His6 complex was applied to a HisTrapTM FF Crude Ni2+-SepharoseTM column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a binding buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-ME, and 20 mm imidazole. After the lysate was loaded, the column was washed for an additional 20 column volumes (CVs) with binding buffer. Denaturing buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 6 m guanidine-HCl was then applied for 15 CVs to remove Phd antitoxin. Denatured Doc-His6 was on-column refolded by gradually reducing the concentration of guanidine-HCl to 0 mm by exchanging the column solution back to the binding buffer, in 20 CVs over 8 h. Doc-His6 was eluted from the column with elution buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-ME, and 300 mm imidazole). Fractions containing Doc-His6 were combined and applied to a Sephadex 75 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-ME. BL21 Gold (DE3) pLysS cells containing pET21c-docH66Y were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5–0.7 and induced with 0.4 mm IPTG. Cultures were grown for 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and ruptured by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-ME, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The sonicated mixture was centrifuged to obtain the supernatant containing Doc H66Y-His6. The cleared lysate was applied to a HisTrapTM FF Crude Ni2+-Sepharose column equilibrated with a binding buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-ME, and 20 mm imidazole. After the lysate was loaded, the column was washed for 20 CVs with binding buffer, followed by additional washes (10 CV each) with 1 m KCl followed by 2 m KCl. Doc H66Y-His6 was eluted from the column with elution buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-ME, and 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing Doc H66Y-His6 were combined and applied to Sephadex 75 16/60 gel filtration column with a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-ME. The kinase activity of Doc in Fig. 2, A and B, was tested using the complete reaction mixture (solution A + solution B) from the PURExpress kit (NEB). Briefly, reaction mixtures were prepared as specified with or without the addition of 3.8 μm (38 pmol in 10 μl) purified Doc protein. To neutralize toxin activity, 7.5 μm (75 pmol) Phd was preincubated with 3.8 μm (38 pmol) Doc at 37 °C for 15 min. Within the 10-μl reaction volume for each sample, we used 0.5 μl of 1.7 μm γ-32P (6000 Ci/mmol) or α-32P (3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The activity of Doc against whole cell lysates was also determined. Whole cell lysates used for Fig. 2C were obtained by growing E. coli BL21(DE3) cells in M9 liquid medium to an A600 of 1.4. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole and lysed by sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged and the supernatant used as cell lysate. The ability of Doc to phosphorylate components of this cell lysate was tested by adding 1.0 μm (30 pmol) wild-type or Doc H66Y to 9.5 μl of cell lysate, 3 μl of 10× reaction buffer, and 2 μl of 0.17 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). The total reaction volume was brought up to 30 μl, yielding 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). In lysate plus Phd samples, 2.0 μm (60 pmol) Phd was added in place of Doc. To neutralize toxin activity, Phd and Doc were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 20, and 80 min. To all samples in experiments described above, at the appropriate time an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to terminate the kinase reaction. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to separation on a 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylation of pure EF-Tu (NEB) was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT. 4.0 μm (120 pmol) EF-Tu, 1.0 μm (30 pmol) Doc, and 2.0 μm (60 pmol) Phd were added to the reactions as indicated to a 30-μl reaction. 2 μl of 0.17 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was added to all reactions. Phd neutralization of Doc was performed by preincubation of the two proteins at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 20, and 40 min. At the times indicated, an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to terminate the kinase reaction. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to separation on a 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Also at the times indicated, 1 μl of sample was removed and added to 14 μl of 4.0 n formic acid for analysis by TLC. Samples were spotted onto PEI-cellulose (EMD Millipore) and resolved using 0.4 m sodium phosphate. 23 μm EF-Tu was added to a reaction containing 250 μm GDP, GTP, GTPγS, or GMP-PNP in GTP loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 7.5 mm EDTA) for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 50 mm. A 10-fold excess of GDP, GTP, or GTP analog was used to favor formation of the desired form of EF-Tu. This preloaded EF-Tu was then used in the reactions described under “Kinase Assays” above. In the kirromycin experiments, kirromycin diluted in HPLC-grade methanol was added to the appropriate reactions to a final concentration of 10 μm. Alexander et al. established that maximal inhibition of EF-Tu phosphorylation was achieved at this concentration (38Alexander C. Bilgin N. Lindschau C. Mesters J.R. Kraal B. Hilgenfeld R. Erdmann V.A. Lippmann C. Phosphorylation of elongation factor Tu prevents ternary complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14541-14547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In reactions lacking kirromycin an identical amount of methanol was added to make sure that it did not have an effect on the reaction. To test whether addition of EF-Tu could rescue translation activity after inhibition by Doc (Fig. 5) we used the PURExpress kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Specifically, to the complete reaction mixture (solution A + solution B) Doc was added to 3.8 μm, incubated for 1.5 h, then Phd was added to 7.6 μm for 15 min to inhibit Doc activity. An equal volume of EF-Tu (to 25 μm) or water was added and incubated for 1.75 h to reconstitute translation activity. An equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to terminate the translation reaction. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to separation on a 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Production of the dihydrofolate reductase protein (∼20 kDa) was assessed via [35S]methionine incorporation. To maximize sequence coverage, three equivalently loaded and excised gel bands of EF-Tu were digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase, respectively. Peptide sequence analysis of each digestion mixture was performed by microcapillary reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (μLC-MS/MS) on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The Orbitrap repetitively surveyed an m/z range from 395 to 1600, whereas data-dependent MS/MS spectra on the 20 most abundant ions in each survey scan were acquired in the linear ion trap. MS/MS spectra were acquired with relative collision energy of 30%, 2.5-Da isolation width, and recurring ions dynamically excluded for 60 s. Preliminary sequencing of peptides was facilitated with the SEQUEST algorithm with a 30 ppm mass tolerance against the Uniprot Knowledgebase E. coli K12 reference proteome supplemented with a database of common laboratory contaminants, concatenated to a reverse decoy database. Using a custom version of Proteomics Browser Suite (PBS v.2.7, ThermoFisher Scientific) peptide-spectrum matches were accepted with mass error <2.5 ppm and score thresholds to attain an estimated false discovery rate of ∼1%. Data sets for all digest results were combined in silico, culled of minor contaminant peptide-spectrum matches, and re-searched with SEQUEST against the EF-Tu sequence without taking into account enzyme specificity and with differential modifications of phosphorylated tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues. The discovery of phosphopeptides and subsequent manual confirmation of their MS/MS spectra were facilitated by in-house versions of programs MuQuest, GraphMod, and FuzzyIons (Proteomics Browser Suite, ThermoFisher Scientific). Docking simulations between Doc and EF-Tu were performed by first implementing a Global search using the program GRAMM-X (25Tovchigrechko A. Vakser I.A. GRAMM-X public web server for protein-protein docking.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W310-W314Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) between Doc protein (PDB ID 3K33, chain A) and E. coli EF-Tu from the ternary complex of EF-Tu·tRNA·GTP complex (PDB ID 1OB2, chain A) or EF-Tu·GDP complex (PDB ID 1EFC, chain A). Both EF-Tu starting models were used because there are large conformational changes that occur upon tRNA-GTP binding (26Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Crystal structure of the ternary complex of Phe-tRNAPhe, EF-Tu, and a GTP analog.Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The simulation was performed for each set independently between two proteins that were arbitrarily placed, however, with the one criterion that EF-Tu Thr-382 and His-66 of Doc protein are in proximity.

https://openalex.org/W2075359233,"Sirtuin-1 (SirT1), a member of the NAD(+)-dependent class III histone deacetylase family, is inactivated in vitro by oxidation of critical cysteine thiols. In a model of metabolic syndrome, SirT1 activation attenuated apoptosis of hepatocytes and improved liver function including lipid metabolism. We show in SirT1-overexpressing HepG2 cells that oxidants (nitrosocysteine and hydrogen peroxide) or metabolic stress (high palmitate and high glucose) inactivated SirT1 by reversible oxidative post-translational modifications (OPTMs) on three cysteines. Mutating these oxidation-sensitive cysteines to serine preserved SirT1 activity and abolished reversible OPTMs. Overexpressed mutant SirT1 maintained deacetylase activity and attenuated proapoptotic signaling, whereas overexpressed wild type SirT1 was less protective in metabolically or oxidant-stressed cells. To prove that OPTMs of SirT1 are glutathione (GSH) adducts, glutaredoxin-1 was overexpressed to remove this modification. Glutaredoxin-1 overexpression maintained endogenous SirT1 activity and prevented proapoptotic signaling in metabolically stressed HepG2 cells. The in vivo significance of oxidative inactivation of SirT1 was investigated in livers of high fat diet-fed C57/B6J mice. SirT1 deacetylase activity was decreased in the absence of changes in SirT1 expression and associated with a marked increase in OPTMs. These results indicate that glutathione adducts on specific SirT1 thiols may be responsible for dysfunctional SirT1 associated with liver disease in metabolic syndrome."

We first sought out examples of workarounds, such as delayed data entry, entering data in wrong places and individuals using the EHR while logged in as a colleague, then identified possible reasons for the reported workarounds. Our analysis identified four main categories of factors contributing to workarounds (i.e., operational, cultural, organisational and technical). Operational factors included poor system integration with existing workflows and the system not meeting users' perceived needs. Cultural factors involved users' competence with IT and resistance to change. Organisational factors referred to insufficient organisational resources and training, while technical factors included inadequate local technical infrastructure. Many of these factors, such as integrating the EHR system with day-to-day operational processes, staff training and adequate local IT infrastructure, were likely to apply to system implementations in various settings, but we also identified factors that related particularly to implementing EHRs in mental health hospitals, for example: EHR system incompatibility with IT systems used by mental health-related sectors, notably social services; the EHR system lacking specific, mental health functionalities and options; and clinicians feeling unable to use computers while attending to distressed psychiatric patients.A better conceptual model of reasons for workarounds should help with designing, and supporting the implementation and adoption of, EHRs for use in hospital mental health settings."
https://openalex.org/W2080722894,"The interferon-induced dynamin-like MxA protein has broad antiviral activity against many viruses, including orthomyxoviruses such as influenza A and Thogoto virus and bunyaviruses such as La Crosse virus. MxA consists of an N-terminal globular GTPase domain, a connecting bundle signaling element, and the C-terminal stalk that mediates oligomerization and antiviral specificity. We previously reported that the disordered loop L4 that protrudes from the compact stalk is a key determinant of antiviral specificity against influenza A and Thogoto virus. However, the role of individual amino acids for viral target recognition remained largely undefined. By mutational analyses, we identified two regions in the C-terminal part of L4 that contribute to an antiviral interface. Mutations in the proximal motif, at positions 561 and 562, abolished antiviral activity against orthomyxoviruses but not bunyaviruses. In contrast, mutations in the distal motif, around position 577, abolished antiviral activity against both viruses. These results indicate that at least two structural elements in L4 are responsible for antiviral activity and that the proximal motif determines specificity for orthomyxoviruses, whereas the distal sequence serves a conserved structural function."

To provide direct visual evidence for the in situ dimerization and function of multiple normal and mutant ZnTs, we applied here the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technique, which enables direct visualization of specific protein-protein interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2045826354,"Background Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a synthetic material that has been widely used in industrial applications for decades. Exposure to PFOS has been associated with decreased adult testosterone level, and Leydig cell impairment during the time of adulthood. However, little is known about PFOS effects in utero on fetal Leydig cells (FLC). Methods and Results The present study investigated effects of PFOS on FLC function. Pregnant Sprague Dawley female rats received vehicle (0.05% Tween20) or PFOS (5, 20 mg/kg) by oral gavage from gestational day (GD) 11–19. At GD20, testosterone (T) production, FLC numbers and ultrastructure, testicular gene and protein expression levels were examined. The results indicate that exposures to PFOS have affected FLC function as evidenced by decreased T production, impaired FLC, reduced FLC number, and decreased steroidogenic capacity and cholesterol level in utero. Conclusion The present study shows that PFOS is an endocrine disruptor of male reproductive system as it causes reduction of T production and impairment of rat fetal Leydig cells."
https://openalex.org/W2135745360,"In mammalian cells, mitochondria receive most incoming iron, yet no entry pathway for iron at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) has been characterized. Our results show that the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) occurs in the OMM. Immunoblots detected DMT1 in mitochondria from a pneumocyte cell model in their OMM. Using the split-ubiquitin yeast 2-hybrid system, we found that cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COXII) and the translocase of OMM 6-kDa subunit (Tom6) homologue interact with DMT1. COXII coimmunoprecipitates with DMT1. There are 4 DMT1 isoforms that differ at the N and C termini. Using HEK293 cells that inducibly express all of the 4 ends of DMT1, we found all of them in the OMM, as detected by immunoblots after cell fractionation, and in isolated mitochondria, as detected by immunofluorescence. Immunoblot analysis of purified cell fractions from rat renal cortex confirmed and extended these results to the kidney, which expressed high levels of DMT1. Immunogold labeling detected DMT1 colocalization in mitochondria with the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-1, which is expressed in the OMM.

https://openalex.org/W2160936387,"Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1; Ad4BP/NR5A1) plays key roles in gonadal development. Initially, the Sf1 gene is expressed in mouse fetal gonads of both sexes, but later is up-regulated in testes and down-regulated in ovaries. While Sf1 expression is activated and maintained by Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and LIM homeobox 9 (LHX9), the mechanism of sex-specific regulation remains unclear. We hypothesized that Sf1 is repressed by the transcription factor Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) during ovarian development. In an in vitro system (TM3 cells), up-regulation of Sf1 by the WT1 splice variant WT1-KTS was antagonized by FOXL2, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Using reporter assays, we localized the Sf1 proximal promoter region involved in this antagonism to a 674-bp interval. A conserved FOXL2 binding site was identified in this interval by in vitro chromatin immunoprecipitation. Introducing mutations into this site abolished negative regulation by FOXL2 in reporter assays. Finally, in Foxl2-null mice, Sf1 expression was increased 2-fold relative to wild-type XX fetal gonads. Our results support the hypothesis that FOXL2 negatively regulates Sf1 expression by antagonizing WT1-KTS during early ovarian development in mice."

Despite the global importance, little is known about the pathogenesis mechanisms of F. virguliforme. Thus, we applied Next-Generation DNA Sequencing to reveal the draft F. virguliforme genome sequence and identified putative pathogenicity genes to facilitate discovering the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause this disease.We have generated the draft genome sequence of F. virguliforme by conducting whole-genome shotgun sequencing on a 454 GS-FLX Titanium sequencer. Initially, single-end reads of a 400-bp shotgun library were assembled using the PCAP program. Paired end sequences from 3 and 20 Kb DNA fragments and approximately 100 Kb inserts of 1,400 BAC clones were used to generate the assembled genome. The assembled genome sequence was 51 Mb. The N50 scaffold number was 11 with an N50 Scaffold length of 1,263 Kb. The AUGUSTUS gene prediction program predicted 14,845 putative genes, which were annotated with Pfam and GO databases. Gene distributions were uniform in all but one of the major scaffolds. Phylogenic analyses revealed that F. virguliforme was closely related to the pea pathogen, Nectria haematococca. Of the 14,845 F. virguliforme genes, 11,043 were conserved among five Fusarium species: F. virguliforme, F. graminearum, F. verticillioides, F. oxysporum and N. haematococca; and 1,332 F. virguliforme-specific genes, which may include pathogenicity genes. Additionally, searches for candidate F. virguliforme pathogenicity genes using gene sequences of the pathogen-host interaction database identified 358 genes.The F. virguliforme genome sequence and putative pathogenicity genes presented here will facilitate identification of pathogenicity mechanisms involved in SDS development. Together, these resources will expedite our efforts towards discovering pathogenicity mechanisms in F. virguliforme. This will ultimately lead to improvement of SDS resistance in soybean."

The specimen is one of the best preserved crocodyliforms from Paleocene deposits recovered so far and represents a sebecosuchian, one of the few clades that survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene biotic crisis. The new taxon is found in the same deposit as an alligatoroid, a group that experienced large diversification in the Paleogene. The sebecosuchian record suggests that after the Cretaceous-Paleogene biotic crisis, the less specialized members of this clade characterized by a higher number of teeth compared to the baurusuchid sebecosuchians survived, some having terrestrial habits while others developed a semi-aquatic life style (e.g., Lorosuchus). Starting in the Eocene, sebecid sebecosuchians became specialized with a more accentuated oreinirostry as observed in Sebecus and in Langstonia, but not showing the typical reduced dentition developed by the Cretaceous baurusuchid sebecosuchians. The basal position of Barinasuchus arveloi, a high-snouted Miocene sebecid, indicates the occurrence of an independent lineage sometime after the K-Pg biotic crisis that developed accentuated oreinirostry, suggesting a more complex history of the post-K-Pg crocodyliform radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2055036194,"Purpose Uveal melanoma (UM) is associated with a high risk of metastases and lack of efficient therapies. Reduced capacity for apoptosis induction by chemotherapies is one obstacle to efficient treatments. Human UM is characterized by high expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Consequently, regulators of apoptosis such as Bcl-2 family inhibitors may constitute an attractive approach to UM therapeutics. In this aim, we have investigated the efficacy of the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor S44563 on 4 UM Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) and derived-cell lines. Experimental Design Four well characterized UM PDXs were used for in vivo experiments. S44563 was administered alone or combined with fotemustine either concomitantly or after the alkylating agent. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 expressions after S44563 administration were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results S44563 administered alone by at 50 and 100 mg/kg i.p. induced a significant tumour growth inhibition in only one xenograft model with a clear dose effect. However, when S44563 was concomitantly administered with fotemustine, we observed a synergistic activity in 3 out of the 4 tested models. In addition, S44563 administered after fotemustine induced a tumour growth delay in 2 out of 3 tested xenografts. Finally, IHC analyses showed that Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 expression were not modified after S44563 administration. Conclusion The novel anti-apoptotic experimental compound S44563, despite a relative low efficacy when administered alone, increased the efficacy of fotemustine in either concomitant or sequential combinations or indeed subsequent to fotemustine. These data support further exploration of potential therapeutic effect of Bcl-2/Bcl-xl inhibition in human UM."
https://openalex.org/W1998590756,"Recent research indicates that hundreds of thousands of G-rich sequences within the human genome have the potential to form secondary structures known as G-quadruplexes. Telomeric regions, consisting of long arrays of TTAGGG/AATCCC repeats, are among the most likely areas in which these structures might form. Since G-quadruplexes assemble from certain G-rich single-stranded sequences, they might arise when duplex DNA is unwound such as during replication. Coincidentally, these bulky structures when present in the DNA template might also hinder the action of DNA polymerases. In this study, single-stranded telomeric templates with the potential to form G-quadruplexes were examined for their effects on a variety of replicative and translesion DNA polymerases from humans and lower organisms. Our results demonstrate that single-stranded templates containing four telomeric GGG runs fold into intramolecular G-quadruplex structures. These intramolecular G quadruplexes are somewhat dynamic in nature and stabilized by increasing KCl concentrations and decreasing temperatures. Furthermore, the presence of these intramolecular G-quadruplexes in the template dramatically inhibits DNA synthesis by various DNA polymerases, including the human polymerase δ employed during lagging strand replication of G-rich telomeric strands and several human translesion DNA polymerases potentially recruited to sites of replication blockage. Notably, misincorporation of nucleotides is observed when certain translesion polymerases are employed on substrates containing intramolecular G-quadruplexes, as is extension of the resulting mismatched base pairs upon dynamic unfolding of this secondary structure. These findings reveal the potential for blockage of DNA replication and genetic changes related to sequences capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplexes."

We sought to determine the function of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating Npr1 (coding for GC-A/NPRA) gene transcription, using primary mouse mesangial cells treated with class-specific HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). Trichostatin A, a pan inhibitor, and mocetinostat (MGCD0103), a class I HDAC inhibitor, significantly enhanced Npr1 promoter activity (by 8- and 10-fold, respectively), mRNA levels (4- and 5.3-fold, respectively), and NPRA protein (2.7- and 3.5-fold, respectively). However, MC1568 (class II HDAC inhibitor) had no discernible effect. Overexpression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 significantly attenuated Npr1 promoter activity, whereas HDAC3 and HDAC8 had no effect. HDACi-treated cultured cells in vitro and intact animals in vivo showed significantly reduced binding of HDAC1 and -2 and increased accumulation of acetylated H3-K9/14 and H4-K12 at the Npr1 promoter. Deletional analyses of the Npr1 promoter along with ectopic overexpression and inhibition of Sp1 confirmed that HDACi-induced Npr1 gene transcription is accomplished by Sp1 activation. Furthermore, HDACi attenuated the interaction of Sp1 with HDAC1/2 and promoted Sp1 association with p300 and p300/cAMP-binding protein-associated factor; it also promoted the recruitment of p300 and p300/cAMP-binding protein-associated factor to the Npr1 promoter. Our results demonstrate that trichostatin A and MGCD0103 enhanced Npr1 gene expression through inhibition of HDAC1/2 and increased both acetylation of histones (H3-K9/14, H4-K12) and Sp1 by p300, and their recruitment to Npr1 promoter. Our findings define a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism that governs Npr1 gene transcription."

Nevertheless, the potential mechanism has not been explored yet. Here we demonstrate that YHL-14 inhibits bladder and colon cancer cell growth through up-regulation of p21 expression in an Sp1-dependent manner. We found that YHL-14 treatment resulted in up-regulation of p21 expression and a significant G2/M phase arrest in T24T and HCT116 cells without affecting p53 protein expression and activation. Further studies indicate that p21 induction by YHL-14 occurs at the transcriptional level via up-regulation of Sp1 protein expression. Moreover, our results show that p38 is essential for YHL-14-mediated Sp1 protein stabilization, G2/M growth arrest induction, and anchorage-independent growth inhibition of cancer cells. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a novel mechanism of YHL-14 against cancer cell growth in bladder and colon cancer cell lines, which provides valuable information for the design and synthesis of other new conformation-constrained derivatives on the basis of the structure of YHL-14 for cancer therapy."

A new region of the hydrophobic pocket could be exploited for drug design.J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 7768-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we show that LT175 differentially activated PPARγ target genes involved in fatty acid esterification and storage in 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes. This resulted in a less severe lipid accumulation compared with that triggered by rosiglitazone, suggesting that LT175 may have a lower adipogenic activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vivo administration of LT175 to mice fed a high-fat diet decreased body weight, adipocyte size, and white adipose tissue mass, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, LT175 significantly reduced plasma glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol and increased circulating adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor 21 levels. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed that the compound improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the peculiar interaction of LT175 with PPARγ affected the recruitment of the coregulators cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein-binding protein and nuclear corepressor 1 (NCoR1), fundamentals for the PPARγ-mediated adipogenic program. In conclusion, our results describe a new PPAR ligand, modulating lipid and glucose metabolism with reduced adipogenic activity, that may be used as a model for a series of novel molecules with an improved pharmacological profile for the treatment of dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. Ongoing drug discovery programs aim to develop dual PPARα/γ agonists devoid of the side effects of the marketed antidiabetic agents thiazolidinediones and the dual agonists glitazars. Recently, we described a new dual PPARα/γ ligand, LT175, with a partial agonist profile against PPARγ and interacting with a newly identified region of the PPARγ-ligand binding domain (1Montanari R.

Crystal structure of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligand binding domain complexed with a novel partial agonist. A new region of the hydrophobic pocket could be exploited for drug design.J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 7768-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we show that LT175 differentially activated PPARγ target genes involved in fatty acid esterification and storage in 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes. This resulted in a less severe lipid accumulation compared with that triggered by rosiglitazone, suggesting that LT175 may have a lower adipogenic activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vivo administration of LT175 to mice fed a high-fat diet decreased body weight, adipocyte size, and white adipose tissue mass, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, LT175 significantly reduced plasma glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol and increased circulating adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor 21 levels. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed that the compound improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the peculiar interaction of LT175 with PPARγ affected the recruitment of the coregulators cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein-binding protein and nuclear corepressor 1 (NCoR1), fundamentals for the PPARγ-mediated adipogenic program. In conclusion, our results describe a new PPAR ligand, modulating lipid and glucose metabolism with reduced adipogenic activity, that may be used as a model for a series of novel molecules with an improved pharmacological profile for the treatment of dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1992443804,"Metabolomics, the systematic analysis of potential metabolites in a biological specimen, has been increasingly applied to discovering biomarkers, identifying perturbed pathways, measuring therapeutic targets, and discovering new drugs. By analyzing and verifying the significant difference in metabolic profiles and changes of metabolite biomarkers, metabolomics enables us to better understand substance metabolic pathways which can clarify the mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM). Corydalis yanhusuo alkaloid (CA) is a major component of Qizhiweitong (QZWT) prescription which has been used for treating gastric ulcer for centuries and its mechanism remains unclear completely. Metabolite profiling was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-TOF-MS) and in conjunction with multivariate data analysis and pathway analysis. The statistic software Mass Profiller Prossional (MPP) and statistic method including ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA) were used for discovering novel potential biomarkers to clarify mechanism of CA in treating acid injected rats with gastric ulcer. The changes in metabolic profiling were restored to their base-line values after CA treatment according to the PCA score plots. Ten different potential biomarkers and seven key metabolic pathways contributing to the treatment of gastric ulcer were discovered and identified. Among the pathways, sphingophospholipid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism related network were acutely perturbed. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis were performed to evaluate the expression of genes related to the two pathways for verifying the above results. The results show that changed biomarkers and pathways may provide evidence to insight into drug action mechanisms and enable us to increase research productivity toward metabolomics drug discovery."

In this study, two different deletion mutants, rCD226-ECD1 (the first extracellular domain) and rCD226-ECD (full extracellular domains), were recombinantly expressed. We observed that rCD226-ECD1, similar to rCD226-ECD, specifically bound to ligand-positive cell lines and that this interaction could be competitively blocked by an anti-CD226 mAb.

https://openalex.org/W2046899172,"The type III protein secretion system is an important pathogenicity factor of enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli pathotypes. The genes encoding this apparatus are located on a pathogenicity island (the locus of enterocyte effacement) and are transcriptionally activated by the master regulator Ler. In each pathotype Ler is also known to regulate genes located elsewhere on the chromosome, but the full extent of the Ler regulon is unclear, especially for enteropathogenic E. coli. The Ler regulon was defined for two strains of E. coli: E2348/69 (enteropathogenic) and EDL933 (enterohaemorrhagic) in mid and late log phases of growth by DNA microarray analysis of the transcriptomes of wild-type and ler mutant versions of each strain. In both strains the Ler regulon is focused on the locus of enterocyte effacement – all major transcriptional units of which are activated by Ler, with the sole exception of the LEE1 operon during mid-log phase growth in E2348/69. However, the Ler regulon does extend more widely and also includes unlinked pathogenicity genes: in E2348/69 more than 50 genes outside of this locus were regulated, including a number of known or potential pathogenicity determinants; in EDL933 only 4 extra-LEE genes, again including known pathogenicity factors, were activated. In E2348/69, where the Ler regulon is clearly growth phase dependent, a number of genes including the plasmid-encoded regulator operon perABC, were found to be negatively regulated by Ler. Negative regulation by Ler of PerC, itself a positive regulator of the ler promoter, suggests a negative feedback loop involving these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2073408049,"We explored the role played by plasma membrane calcium ATPase-4 (PMCA4) and its alternative splice variants in the cell cycle of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). A novel variant (PMCA4e) was discovered. Quantitative real-time-PCR-quantified PMCA4 splice variant proportions differed in specific organs. The PMCA4a:4b ratio in uninjured carotid arteries (∼1:1) was significantly reduced by wire denudation injury (to ∼1:3) by modulation of alternative splicing, as confirmed by novel antibodies against PMCA4a/e and PMCA4b. Laser capture microdissection localized this shift to the media and adventitia. Primary carotid VSMC from PMCA4 knock-out (P4KO) mice showed impaired [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and G1 phase arrest as compared with wild type (P4WT). Electroporation of expression constructs encoding PMCA4a, PMCA4b, and a PMCA4b mutant lacking PDZ binding rescued this phenotype of P4KO cells, whereas a mutant with only 10% of normal Ca(2+) efflux activity could not. Microarray of early G1-synchronized VSMC showed 39-fold higher Rgs16 (NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) target; MAPK inhibitor) and 69-fold higher Decorin (G1 arrest marker) expression in P4KO versus P4WT. Validation by Western blot also revealed decreased levels of Cyclin D1 and NFATc3 in P4KO. Microarrays of P4KO VSMC rescued by PMCA4a or PMCA4b expression showed reversal of perturbed Rgs16, Decorin, and NFATc3 expression levels. However, PMCA4a rescue caused a 44-fold reduction in AP-2β, a known anti-proliferative transcription factor, whereas PMCA4b rescue resulted in a 50-fold reduction in p15 (Cyclin D1/Cdk4 inhibitor). We conclude that Ca(2+) efflux activity of PMCA4 underlies G1 progression in VSMC and that PMCA4a and PMCA4b differentially regulate specific downstream mediators."

https://openalex.org/W2078569799,"Background Prognostic biomarkers are needed for superficial gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) to predict clinical outcomes and select therapy. Although recurrent mutations have been characterized in EAC, little is known about their clinical and prognostic significance. Aneuploidy is predictive of clinical outcome in many malignancies but has not been evaluated in superficial EAC. Methods We quantified copy number changes in 41 superficial EAC using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays. We identified recurrent chromosomal gains and losses and calculated the total copy number abnormality (CNA) count for each tumor as a measure of aneuploidy. We correlated CNA count with overall survival and time to first recurrence in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Recurrent segmental gains and losses involved multiple genes, including: HER2, EGFR, MET, CDK6, KRAS (recurrent gains); and FHIT, WWOX, CDKN2A/B, SMAD4, RUNX1 (recurrent losses). There was a 40-fold variation in CNA count across all cases. Tumors with the lowest and highest quartile CNA count had significantly better overall survival (p = 0.032) and time to first recurrence (p = 0.010) compared to those with intermediate CNA counts. These associations persisted when controlling for other prognostic variables. Significance SNP arrays facilitate the assessment of recurrent chromosomal gain and loss and allow high resolution, quantitative assessment of segmental aneuploidy (total CNA count). The non-monotonic association of segmental aneuploidy with survival has been described in other tumors. The degree of aneuploidy is a promising prognostic biomarker in a potentially curable form of EAC."
https://openalex.org/W2088228166,"Previous studies have shown that aldosterone, which activates the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), promotes thrombosis in animal models. Our objective was to determine whether MR activation/expression in the vascular endothelium could modify thrombotic risk in vivo and to examine thrombin generation at the surface of aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). MR was conditionally overexpressed in vivo in vascular endothelial cells in mice (MR-EC mice) or stimulated with aldosterone in HAECs. Thrombosis after ferric chloride injury was delayed in MR-EC mice compared with controls as well as in wild-type FVB/NRj mice treated with aldosterone (60 μg/kg/d for 21 d). Thrombin generation in platelet-poor plasma did not differ between MR-EC mice and controls. In MR-EC mice, aortic endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) expression was increased. Aldosterone (10(-8) M) attenuated thrombin generation at the surface of cultured HAECs, and this effect was associated with up-regulation of expression of EPCR, which promotes formation of activated protein C. Aldosterone increases EPCR expression via a transcriptional mechanism involving interaction of MR with the specificity protein 1 site. These findings demonstrate that MR activation acts on endothelial cells to protect against thrombosis in physiological conditions and that MR-mediated EPCR overexpression drives this antithrombotic property through enhancing protein C activation."
https://openalex.org/W2041762633,"Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are continuously exposed to shear stress (SS) generated by blood flow. Such stress plays a key role in regulation of various aspects of EC function including cell proliferation and motility as well as changes in cell morphology. Vascular endothelial-protein-tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) is an R3-subtype PTP that possesses multiple fibronectin type III-like domains in its extracellular region and is expressed specifically in ECs. The role of VE-PTP in EC responses to SS has remained unknown, however. Here we show that VE-PTP is diffusely localized in ECs maintained under static culture conditions, whereas it undergoes rapid accumulation at the downstream edge of the cells relative to the direction of flow in response to SS. This redistribution of VE-PTP triggered by SS was found to require its extracellular and transmembrane regions and was promoted by integrin engagement of extracellular matrix ligands. Inhibition of actin polymerization or of Cdc42, Rab5, or Arf6 activities attenuated the SS-induced redistribution of VE-PTP. VE-PTP also underwent endocytosis in the static and SS conditions. SS induced the polarized distribution of internalized VE-PTP. Such an effect was promoted by integrin engagement of fibronectin but prevented by inhibition of Cdc42 activity or of actin polymerization. In addition, depletion of VE-PTP by RNA interference in human umbilical vein ECs blocked cell elongation in the direction of flow induced by SS. Our results suggest that the polarized redistribution of VE-PTP in response to SS plays an important role in the regulation of EC function by blood flow."
https://openalex.org/W1982675308,"We examined the relationship between transmembrane domain (TM) 10 and TM11/12 in NKCC1, testing homology models based on the structure of AdiC in the same transporter superfamily. We hypothesized that introduced cysteine pairs would be close enough for disulfide formation and would alter transport function: indeed, evidence for cross-link formation with low micromolar concentrations of copper phenanthroline or iodine was found in 3 of 8 initially tested pairs and in 1 of 26 additionally tested pairs. Inhibition of transport was observed with copper phenanthroline and iodine treatment of P676C/A734C and I677C/A734C, consistent with the proximity of these residues and with movement of TM10 during the occlusion step of ion transport. We also found Cu(2+) inhibition of the single-cysteine mutant A675C, suggesting that this residue and Met(382) of TM3 are involved in a Cu(2+)-binding site. Surprisingly, cross-linking of P676C/I730C was found to prevent rapid deactivation of the transporter while not affecting the dephosphorylation rate, thus uncoupling the phosphorylation and activation steps. Consistent with this, (a) cross-linking of P676C/I730C was dependent on activation state, and (b) mutants lacking the phosphoregulatory domain could still be activated by cross-linking. These results suggest a model of NKCC activation that involves movement of TM12 relative to TM10, which is likely tied to movement of the large C terminus, a process somehow triggered by phosphorylation of the regulatory domain in the N terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2169124033,"HCN channels are important regulators of neuronal excitability. The proper function of these channels is governed by various mechanisms, including post-translational modifications of channel subunits. Here, we provide evidence that ubiquitination via a ubiquitin ligase, neuronal precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated (Nedd)-4-2, is involved in the regulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. We identified a PY motif (L/PPxY), the characteristic binding motif for Nedd4-2 in the C terminus of the HCN1 subunit, and showed that HCN1 and Nedd4-2 interacted both in vivo (rat hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum) and in vitro [human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells], resulting in increased HCN1 ubiquitination. Elimination of the PY motif reduced, but did not abolish, Nedd4-2 binding, which further involved a stretch of ∼100 aa downstream in the HCN1 C terminus. Coexpression of Nedd4-2 and HCN1 drastically reduced the HCN1-mediated h-current amplitude (85-92%) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and reduced surface expression (34%) of HCN1 channels in HEK293 cells, thereby opposing effects of tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b interacting protein (TRIP8b)-(1a-4), an auxiliary subunit that promotes HCN1 surface expression. Regulation may further include N-glycosylation of HCN1 channels, which is significantly enhanced by TRIP8b(1a-4), but may be reduced by Nedd4-2. Taken together, our data indicate that Nedd4-2 plays an important role in the regulation of HCN1 trafficking and may compete with TRIP8b(1a-4) in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2040751790,"Background Polymicrobial bloodstream infections (PBSIs) have been associated with complex underlying medical conditions and a high incidence of specific microorganisms in several settings, but the relevant data are scarce in neonates. Methods Positive blood cultures from January 2004 to December 2011 in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) were reviewed. Each neonate with PBSI (case episode) was matched to two episodes of monomicrobial BSI (control episode) by birth weight, gestational age and gender. Records were reviewed to compare their underlying medical conditions, organisms isolated, adequacy of therapy, clinical characteristics and outcomes. Results Forty-five episodes of PBSI (4.4% of all neonatal BSIs) were identified in 43 neonates. Gram-negative organisms constituted 59.8% of all PBSI pathogens, and 33 (73.3%) of PBSIs were caused by at least one Gram-negative organism. PBSIs were significantly more likely to be the recurrent episode and have endotracheal tube in place. No significant difference was found between PBSIs and controls in terms of demographics and most chronic conditions. PBSIs were significantly associated with a higher severity of illness, a longer duration of septic symptoms, and a higher rate of modification of antimicrobial regimens than monomicrobial BSIs. However, the sepsis-attributable mortality rates were comparable between these two groups. Conclusions In the NICU, PBSIs were more often caused by Gram-negative bacilli, and often occurred in neonates without any chronic conditions. The clinical significance of PBSIs included a more severe illness, longer duration of septic symptoms and a higher rate of modification of antimicrobial regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2158734739,"Enzyme or gene replacement therapy with acid α-glucosidase (GAA) has achieved only partial efficacy in Pompe disease. We evaluated the effect of adjunctive clenbuterol treatment on cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR)-mediated uptake and intracellular trafficking of GAA during muscle-specific GAA expression with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector in GAA-knockout (KO) mice. Clenbuterol, which increases expression of CI-MPR in muscle, was administered with the AAV vector. This combination therapy increased latency during rotarod and wirehang testing at 12 wk, in comparison with vector alone. The mean urinary glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4), a urinary biomarker, was lower in GAA-KO mice following combination therapy, compared with vector alone. Similarly, glycogen content was lower in cardiac and skeletal muscle following 12 wk of combination therapy in heart, quadriceps, diaphragm, and soleus, compared with vector alone. These data suggested that clenbuterol treatment enhanced trafficking of GAA to lysosomes, given that GAA was expressed within myofibers. The integral role of CI-MPR was demonstrated by the lack of effectiveness from clenbuterol in GAA-KO mice that lacked CI-MPR in muscle, where it failed to reverse the high glycogen content of the heart and diaphragm or impaired wirehang performance. However, the glycogen content of skeletal muscle was reduced by the addition of clenbuterol in the absence of CI-MPR, as was lysosomal vacuolation, which correlated with increased AKT signaling. In summary, β2-agonist treatment enhanced CI-MPR-mediated uptake and trafficking of GAA in mice with Pompe disease, and a similarly enhanced benefit might be expected in other lysosomal storage disorders.—Farah, B.

Here, we show that postnatal MDSCs could be transdifferentiated into Schwann cell-like cells upon the combined treatment of three neurotrophic factors (PDGF, NT-3 and IGF-2). The transdifferentiation of MDSCs was initially induced by Schwann cell (SC) conditioned medium. MDSCs adopted a spindle-like morphology similar to SCs after the transdifferentiation. Immunocytochemistry and immunoblot showed clearly that the SC markers S100, GFAP and p75 were expressed highly only after the transdifferentiation. Flow cytometry assay showed that the portion of S100 expressed cells was more than 60 percent and over one fourth of the transdifferentiated cells expressed all the three SC markers, indicating an efficient transdifferentiation. We then tested neurotrophic factors in the conditioned medium and found it was PDGF, NT-3 and IGF-2 in combination that conducted the transdifferentiation. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to use specific neurotrophic factors to transdifferentiate MDSCs into Schwann cell-like cells, which might be therapeutically useful for clinical applications."

In contrast, MORF4 was initially cloned and characterized as a senescence gene because cellular expression of MORF4 produces massive cell death and senescence (5Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E.

MORF4L1 was cloned from chromosome 15 as a paralogue of MORF4, and it is also termed mortality factor-related gene on chromosome 15 (MRG15) (7Matsuoka Y. Matsuoka Y. Shibata S. Ban T. Toratani N.

However, MORF4 lacks a chromodomain located within the NH2 terminus of MORF4L1 (8Tominaga K. Pereira-Smith O.M.

Between the CD and MRG domain, a stretch of amino acids of about 20 residues may act as a nuclear localization signal to shift MORF4L1 from the cytoplasmic compartment into the nucleus to exert its epigenetic function. chromodomain histone deacetylase murine lung epithelial MORF4-related gene. Homodimeric formation of MORF4L1 is important in regulating its acetyltransferase activity (22Kumar G.S. Xie T. Zhang Y. Radhakrishnan I. Solution structure of the mSin3A PAH2-Pf1 SID1 complex.

Interestingly, the 20-amino acid span between the CD and MRG domain contains several lysine residues typical of a nuclear localization signal. We observed that several residues within this region are necessary for MORF4L1 homodimerization. In particular, a lysine residue (Lys-148) within this region serves as a major acetylation site of MORF4L1 and is critical for its homodimerization. Importantly, reversible acetylation at this acceptor site serves as a molecular signature in the maintenance of the MORF4L1 homodimeric formation and function. Murine lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells were maintained with HITES medium (500 ml of DMEM/F12, 2.5 mg of insulin, transferrin, sodim selenite, 2.5 mg of transferrin, 10 μm hydrocortisone, 10 μm β-estradiol, 10 mm Hepes, and 2 mm l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% FBS in a 37 °C incubator and 5% CO2 as described previously (26Zou C.

V5 antibody was from Invitrogen. Acetyl-lysine antibody, HDAC2 antibody, and PF1 antibody were from Sigma. HDAC2 shRNA retroviral plasmid was from Origene (Rockville, MD). Cells were nucleofected with plasmids as described previously (16Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics Consortium A genome-wide association study in Europeans and South Asians identifies five new loci for coronary artery disease.Nat.

Briefly, 1 million MLE cells in their exponential growth stage were suspended in 100 μl of nucleofection buffer (20 mm of Hepes in PBS buffer) and well mixed with 3 μg of plasmid DNA in an electroporation cuvette. Electroporation was performed with preset program T-013 in the NucleofectionTM II system (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD), and the cells were cultured in 2 ml of complete HITES medium for 48 h. For gene silencing, a retroviral shRNA plasmid was also delivered into cells by using nucleofection with the same protocol, and 4 μg of retroviral shRNA plasmid was used in each nucleofection. In some experiments, cells were first nucleofected with shRNA plasmid for 24 h and followed by coexpression of V5- or Myc-tagged MORF4L1 plasmids for an extra 24 h. After 48 h of incubation, cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Zou C. Butler P.L. Coon T.A. Smith R.M.

Cell lysates were prepared by brief sonication of harvested cells in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.025% sodium azide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and appropriate amounts of protease inhibitor mixture (pH 7.4)). The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Images were obtained with a Carestream Kodak in vivo Image F Pro System. Antibodies were diluted 1:1000 except when specifically indicated. Cells expressed with wild-type or the mutant MORF4L1 plasmid were harvested and lysed with buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were subjected to size exclusion spin column fractionation (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following the protocol of the manufacturer. Fractions of less than 50 kDa, 50–100 kDa, and more than 100 kDa were collected for immunoblot analysis. Recombinant NH2 terminus-truncated MORF4L1 (amino acids 130–362) was expressed and purified following the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, MORF4L1 recombinant protein expression was conducted by introducing the pcDNA3.1/MOF4L1 (amino acids 130–362) plasmid into Escherichia coli strain BL21. Recombinant protein was purified with NI60 his-resin. The elution was separated by electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue stain. Recombinant proteins of V5-tagged or Myc-tagged wild-type MORF4L1 and the cysteine mutants C19S, C30S, and C19S/C30S were generated by using a TnT® coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The recombinant proteins were mixed together in pulldown buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture) and rotated in 4 °C for 2 h. V5 antibody conjugated with agarose beads (30 μl) was added to the mixture and incubated overnight. Beads were spun down and washed with pulldown buffer three times. The precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. MLE cells during exponential growth were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were subjected to sonication, and samples were spun at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell lysates (containing 1 mg of protein) were incubated and rotated with 2 μg of V5 antibody at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads for another 3 h, beads were spun down and washed with lysis buffer three times. The immunoprecipitates were mixed with 50 μl of SDS loading dye (containing 1% SDS and 10 mm DTT) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Human MORF4L1 cDNA was purchased from Origene, and the coding region of the gene was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 by PCR using the forward primer 5′-atggcgccgaagcaggacccg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-cacagctttccgatggtactcagg-3′.

Cell proliferation was assayed as described previously (27Zou C. Chen Y. Smith R.M. Snavely C. Li J. Coon T.A. Chen B.B. Zhao Y. Mallampalli R.K.

The cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/ml in 6-well plates and allowed to grow in a standard cell culture incubator. For each cell line, three independent wells were harvested after 48 h post-seeding. The cells were counted using a T10 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). All data were statistically analyzed by Student's t test and presented as mean ± S.E. Gel filtration and size exclusion chromatographic studies reported that histone acetyltransferase MORF4L1 is located in two fractions: one is around 70 kDa and another approximately 700 kDa (20Hayakawa T. Ohtani Y. Hayakawa N. Shinmyozu K. Saito M. Ishikawa F. Nakayama J.

Proteomics. 2013; 12: 3851-3873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of MORF4L1 is comprised of 362 amino acids. Crystallographic studies show that MORF4L1 is a homodimer and that MORF4L1 forms a complex with other transcription factors to exert its epigenetic function (22Kumar G.S. Xie T. Zhang Y. Radhakrishnan I. Solution structure of the mSin3A PAH2-Pf1 SID1 complex. A Mad1/Mxd1-like interaction disrupted by MRG15 in the Rpd3S/Sin3S complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 408: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To confirm these observations, we fractioned the cell lysates with a size exclusion spin column followed by immunoblot analysis. Low levels of MORF4L1 were detected in a monomeric form. MORF4L1 was predominately detected in the fractions of 50–100 kDa and a more than 100-kDa-size fraction (Fig. 1A). These data are consistent with published observations, indicating that MORF4L1 may be a homodimer, as reflected by its size (50–100 kDa), and a component of the large corepressor complex (20Hayakawa T. Ohtani Y. Hayakawa N. Shinmyozu K. Saito M. Ishikawa F. Nakayama J. RBP2 is an MRG15 complex component and down-regulates intragenic histone H3 lysine 4 methylation.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 811-826PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kirkwood K.J. Ahmad Y. Larance M. Lamond A.I.

Proteomics. 2013; 12: 3851-3873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To further test this hypothesis, we constructed V5-tagged and Myc-tagged MORF4L1 expression plasmids, coexpressed the plasmids in MLE cells, and subjected the cell lysates to coimmunoprecipitation analysis. Results from V5 immunoprecipitation showed that Myc-tagged MORF4L1 interacts with V5-tagged MORF4L1 (Fig. 1B). We then synthesized V5-tagged and Myc-tagged recombinant MORF4L1 proteins for in vitro binding assays. Pulldown assays proved that V5-tagged recombinant MORF4L1 interacts with Myc-tagged MORF4L1 protein (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that MORF4L1 exists as a dimer and a component in the high molecular complex under normal culture conditions. Because MORF4L1 appears to form a homodimer, we examined the mechanism of its homodimeric formation. In general, cysteine residues within a protein play a crucial role in dimerization. In the NH2 terminus of MORF4L1, there are two cysteine residues, Cys-19 and Cys-30. To assess the contribution of these molecular sites in MORF4L1 homodimerization, we generated MORF4L1-V5 cysteine point mutant plasmids and expressed the plasmids in cells. The immunoprecipitation results indicate that MORF4L1 interacts with each cysteine variant (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the C19S mutant, a C30S mutant, and a C19S/C30S double mutant each bind to wild-type MORF4L1 at lower but comparable levels as wild-type MORF4L1. These data suggest that two cysteine residues within MORF4L1 do not play essential roles in MORF4L1 homodimerization. To explore further molecular elements that may impact MORF4L1 homodimerization, we generated MORF4L1 deletion mutant plasmids, expressed them in cells, and performed coimmunoprecipitation to better define the self-interaction region within MORF4L1 (Fig. 2B). The results showed that deletion of the first 130 amino acids of the NH2-terminal chromodomain does not affect its homodimerization (Fig. 2C). We then deleted an additional 10 amino acids within the NH2 terminus of MORF4L1 and found that deletion of 140 amino acids slightly affected its homodimerization. Notably, deletion of 150 amino acids in its NH2 terminus completely abolished MORF4L1 homodimeric formation (Fig. 2C). In these studies, cotransfection of V5-truncated MORF4L1 mutants with Myc-tagged, wild-type MORF4L1 plasmids resulted in a lower level of expression of the truncated variant plasmids. However, the absence of any V5 signal despite modest expression of the 150–362 MORF4L1 variant (Fig. 2C, top row, right lane versus bottom row) strongly suggests that a region harbors molecular signatures important in protein dimerization. This region between the chromodomain and the MRG domain contains a stretch of amino acids of ∼20 amino acids in length. In addition, we expressed and purified a NH2-terminal truncated MORF4L1 (amino acids 130–362). The recombinant protein was separated by electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue stain (Fig. 2D). The results show that the NH2 terminus-truncated MORF4L1 efficiently forms a dimer. These results suggest that the amino acids from 140–150 are necessary for MORF4L1 homodimerization. The 20 amino acids between the chromodomain and"

In this study, we studied cardiac phosphoinositide levels in both cells and whole animals under the stimulation of norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (Ang II), and other physiologically relevant interventions. The results demonstrated that activation of membrane receptors related to NE or Ang II caused an initial increase and a later fall in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels in the primary cultured cardiomyocytes from adult rats. The possible mechanism underlying this increase in PIP2 was found to be through an enhanced activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ, which was mediated by an up-regulated interaction between phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ and PKC; the increased activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase γ was also involved for NE-induced increase of PIP2. When the systolic functions of the NE/Ang II-treated cells were measured, a maintained or failed contractility was found to be correlated with a rise or fall in corresponding PIP2 levels. In two animal models of cardiac hypertrophy, PIP2 levels were significantly reduced in hypertrophic hearts induced by isoprenaline but not in those induced by swimming exercise. This study describes a novel mechanism for phosphoinositide metabolism and modulation of cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W2027332239,"The vaccinia viral protein A27 in mature viruses specifically interacts with heparan sulfate for cell surface attachment. In addition, A27 associates with the viral membrane protein A17 to anchor to the viral membrane; however, the specific interaction between A27 and A17 remains largely unclear. To uncover the active binding sites and the underlying binding mechanism, we expressed and purified the N-terminal (18-50 residues) and C-terminal (162-203 residues) fragments of A17, which are denoted A17-N and A17-C. Through surface plasmon resonance, the binding affinity of A27/A17-N (KA = 3.40 × 10(8) m(-1)) was determined to be approximately 3 orders of magnitude stronger than that of A27/A17-C (KA = 3.40 × 10(5) m(-1)), indicating that A27 prefers to interact with A17-N rather than A17-C. Despite the disordered nature of A17-N, the A27-A17 interaction is mediated by a specific and cooperative binding mechanism that includes two active binding sites, namely (32)SFMPK(36) (denoted as F1 binding) and (20)LDKDLFTEEQ(29) (F2). Further analysis showed that F1 has stronger binding affinity and is more resistant to acidic conditions than is F2. Furthermore, A27 mutant proteins that retained partial activity to interact with the F1 and F2 sites of the A17 protein were packaged into mature virus particles at a reduced level, demonstrating that the F1/F2 interaction plays a critical role in vivo. Using these results in combination with site-directed mutagenesis data, we established a computer model to explain the specific A27-A17 binding mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2059787636,"Two-way selection is a common phenomenon in nature and society. It appears in the processes like choosing a mate between men and women, making contracts between job hunters and recruiters, and trading between buyers and sellers. In this paper, we propose a model of two-way selection system, and present its analytical solution for the expectation of successful matching total and the regular pattern that the matching rate trends toward an inverse proportion to either the ratio between the two sides or the ratio of the state total to the smaller group's people number. The proposed model is verified by empirical data of the matchmaking fairs. Results indicate that the model well predicts this typical real-world two-way selection behavior to the bounded error extent, thus it is helpful for understanding the dynamics mechanism of the real-world two-way selection system."
https://openalex.org/W2102972548,"Background Little is known about the contribution of school contextual factors to individual student body mass index (BMI). We set out to determine if school characteristics/resources: (1) are associated with student BMI; (2) explain racial/ethnic disparities in student BMI; and (3) explain school-level differences in student BMI. Methods Using gender-stratified multi-level modeling strategies we examined the association of school characteristics/resources and individual BMI in 4,387 5th graders in the Healthy Passages Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Additionally, we examined the association of race/ethnicity and individual BMI as well as the between-school variance in BMI before and after adding individual and school characteristics to test for attenuation. Results The school-level median household income, but not physical activity or nutrition resources, was inversely associated with female BMI (β = −0.12, CI: −0.21,−0.02). Neither school demographics nor physical activity/nutrition resources were predictive of individual BMI in males. In Black females, school characteristics attenuated the association of race/ethnicity and BMI. Individual student characteristics—not school characteristics/resources-reduced the between-school variation in BMI in males by nearly one-third and eliminated it in females. Conclusions In this cohort of 5th graders, school SES was inversely associated with female BMI while school characteristics and resources largely explained Black/White disparities in female weight status. Between-school differences in average student weight status were largely explained by the composition of the student body not by school characteristics or programming."
https://openalex.org/W2089023455,"Backgrounds In insects, cholesterol is one of the membrane components in cells and a precursor of ecdysteroid biosynthesis. Because insects lack two key enzymes, squalene synthase and lanosterol synthase, in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, they cannot autonomously synthesize cholesterol de novo from simple compounds and therefore have to obtain sterols from their diet. Sterol carrier protein (SCP) is a cholesterol-binding protein responsible for cholesterol absorption and transport. Results In this study, a model of the three-dimensional structure of SlSCPx-2 in Spodoptera litura, a destructive polyphagous agricultural pest insect in tropical and subtropical areas, was constructed. Docking of sterol and fatty acid ligands to SlSCPx-2 and ANS fluorescent replacement assay showed that SlSCPx-2 was able to bind with relatively high affinities to cholesterol, stearic acid, linoleic acid, stigmasterol, oleic acid, palmitic acid and arachidonate, implying that SlSCPx may play an important role in absorption and transport of these cholesterol and fatty acids from host plants. Site-directed mutation assay of SlSCPx-2 suggests that amino acid residues F53, W66, F89, F110, I115, T128 and Q131 are critical for the ligand-binding activity of the SlSCPx-2 protein. Virtual ligand screening resulted in identification of several lead compounds which are potential inhibitors of SlSCPx-2. Bioassay for inhibitory effect of five selected compounds showed that AH-487/41731687, AG-664/14117324, AG-205/36813059 and AG-205/07775053 inhibited the growth of S. litura larvae. Conclusions Compounds AH-487/41731687, AG-664/14117324, AG-205/36813059 and AG-205/07775053 selected based on structural modeling showed binding affinity to SlSCPx-2 protein and inhibitory effect on the growth of S. litura larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2069802043,"The membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenase (MBH) supports growth of Ralstonia eutropha H16 with H2 as the sole energy source. The enzyme undergoes a complex biosynthesis process that proceeds during cell growth even at ambient O2 levels and involves 14 specific maturation proteins. One of these is a rubredoxin-like protein, which is essential for biosynthesis of active MBH at high oxygen concentrations but dispensable under microaerobic growth conditions. To obtain insights into the function of HoxR, we investigated the MBH protein purified from the cytoplasmic membrane of hoxR mutant cells. Compared with wild-type MBH, the mutant enzyme displayed severely decreased hydrogenase activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopic analyses revealed features resembling those of O2-sensitive [NiFe] hydrogenases and/or oxidatively damaged protein. The catalytic center resided partially in an inactive Niu-A-like state, and the electron transfer chain consisting of three different Fe-S clusters showed marked alterations compared with wild-type enzyme. Purification of HoxR protein from its original host, R. eutropha, revealed only low protein amounts. Therefore, recombinant HoxR protein was isolated from Escherichia coli. Unlike common rubredoxins, the HoxR protein was colorless, rather unstable, and essentially metal-free. Conversion of the atypical iron-binding motif into a canonical one through genetic engineering led to a stable reddish rubredoxin. Remarkably, the modified HoxR protein did not support MBH-dependent growth at high O2. Analysis of MBH-associated protein complexes points toward a specific interaction of HoxR with the Fe-S cluster-bearing small subunit. This supports the previously made notion that HoxR avoids oxidative damage of the metal centers of the MBH, in particular the unprecedented Cys6[4Fe-3S] cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1982471859,"Tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide (As4S4) is an arsenic compound with anti-tumor activity, especially in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that are resistant to retinoic acid (RA). Although recent studies revealed that the therapeutic action of As4S4 is closely associated with the induction of cellular apoptosis, the exact molecular mechanism of action of As4S4 in RA-resistant APL remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that As4S4-induced apoptosis was accompanied by reduced mRNA and protein expression of SET gene in RA-resistant NB4-R1 cells. Moreover, RNAi knockdown of SET gene further promoted As4S4-induced apoptosis, while SET over-expression inhibited it, suggesting that As4S4 induces apoptosis through the reduction of SET protein in NB4-R1 cells. We also demonstrated that the knockdown of SET gene resulted in the upregulation of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) expression and the downregulation of promyelocytic leukemia and retinoic acid receptor α fusion gene (PML-RARα) expression, which were enhanced by As4S4 treatments. By contrast, over-expression of SET gene resulted in PP2A downregulation and PML-RARα upregulation, which were abolished by As4S4 pretreatment. Since PP2A is a pro-apoptotic factor and PMLRARα is an anti-apoptotic factor, our results suggest that As4S4-induced apoptosis in NB4-R1 cells is through the downregulation of SET protein expression, which in turn increases PP2A and reduces PML-RARα expressions to lead to cell apoptosis."
