https://openalex.org/W1994635899,"Homogenates of mouse liver and brain at 37 degrees C spontaneously formed lipid peroxides and simultaneously evolved ethane. alpha-Tocopherol, a lipid antioxidant, blocked ethane formation. When mice were injected with carbon tetrachloride (a liquid prooxidant for liver), the animals produced ethane. Ethane evolution in vivo was stimulated by prior administration of phenobarbital and it was diminished by prior injection of alpha-tocopherol. These data suggest that ethane production may be a useful index of lipid peroxidation in tissue homogenates and in intact animals."

Stimulation of multiple electrodes allowed one patient to recognize simple patterns, including letters. Both patients made an uneventful recovery, and the success of these experiments reinforces the hope that a functional visual prosthesis can be developed, although many problems remain to be solved."
https://openalex.org/W1531765158,"Complete activation of prothrombin (mol wt 72,000 to 74,000) by activated Factor X, Factor V, and phospholipid results in the formation of thrombin (mol wt 37,000) and two activation fragments (Fragment 1 and Fragment 2) which cannot be activated to thrombin. Partial activation of prothrombin with activated Factor X allows the isolation of two products which can be further activated to thrombin. These products are designated Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2. Incubation of prothrombin with thrombin results in the formation of Intermediate 1 (mol wt 48,000 to 50,000) and Fragment 1 (mol wt 22,000 to 24,000). Intermediate 1 activation requires two proteolytic cleavages. The first cleavage of Intermediate 1 by activated Factor X results in the formation of Intermediate 2 (mol wt 37,000 to 38,000) and Fragment 2 (mol wt 12,800). The second cleavage by activated Factor X forms the A and B chains of thrombin. The two activation fragments generated in the presence of activated Factor X alone are indistinguishable from those generated in the presence of activated Factor X, Factor V, and phospholipid by the criteria of disc gel electrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, ion exchange chromatography, and amino acid composition."
https://openalex.org/W1559122076,"Abstract Golgi apparatus fractions from rat liver contained all glycosyltransferases which catalyze the in vitro biosynthesis of N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide (Gm3), (N-acetylneuraminyl)2-galactosylglucosylceramide (Gd3), N-acetylgalactosaminyl-(N-acetylneuraminyl)-galactosylglucosylceramide (Gm2), galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-(N-acetylneuraminyl)-galactosyglucosylceramide (Gm1), and N-acetylneuraminylgalactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-(N-acetylneuraminyl)-galactosylglucosylceramide (Gd1a) from the corresponding precursors. Relative to total particulate fractions, these transferases were enriched 22 to 27 times in Golgi apparatus. Rough endoplasmic reticulum fractions also contained a full complement of these glycolipid glycosyltransferases; specific activities with endoplasmic reticulum were 2 to 4 times those of total particulate fractions. Plasma membrane fractions displayed negligible glycolipid glycosytransferase activities. The combined Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum fractions accounted for more than 80% of the total homogenate glycolipid glycosyltransferase activities. The results show that gangliosides are not synthesized at the surface membrane. As with membrane glycoproteins, gangliosides appear to be glycosylated in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus during transport to the surface membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1979332105,"The effect of a mixed Western, high meat diet or a nonmeat diet on the intestinal bacterial beta-glucuronidase activity was studied in human volunteers. This enzyme was significantly higher in stools of subjects on a high meat diet as compared to the nonmeat regimen. Thus, intestinal flora of subjects on a high meat diet was more able to hydrolyze glucuronide conjugates than that of individuals on a nonmeat diet. This, in turn, may raise the amount of substances, such as carcinogens, within the colonic lumen."

https://openalex.org/W1503442259,"Abstract The reduced form of thioredoxin, a low molecular weight hydrogen transport protein, was isolated from calf liver. The purification involved heat treatment and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-50, and CM-cellulose, and it resulted in an apparently pure protein after a 4,000-fold purification with a final yield of 30%. The thioredoxin preparation obtained was homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the presence of valine as the only NH2-terminal amino acid. Chromatography on Sephadex indicated a molecular weight of approximately 12,000 for liver thioredoxin and amino acid analysis showed a content of 103 amino acid residues, including 4 half-cystine residues. Oxidation in vitro of the reduced form of calf liver thioredoxin indicated that only 2 of the half-cystine residues formed an oxidation-reduction-active disulfide bridge."
https://openalex.org/W1504028921,"Abstract Prothrombin is activated by activated Factor X ± (Factor V and phospholipid) in the presence of diisopropylfluorophosphate which preferentially inhibits thrombin. Under these conditions a single activation fragment, designated Fragment 1·2, is released which represents the complete nonthrombin portion of the prothrombin molecule. The same fragment is seen as a transient species in the absence of diisopropylfluorophosphate when the activation reaction is monitored by disc electrophoresis in 8 m urea. The NH2terminal residue of both prothrombin and Fragment 1·2 is alanine, suggesting that Fragment 1·2 is derived from the NH2-terminal end of the prothrombin molecule. Fragment 1·2 is not cleaved by activated Factor X ± (Factor V and phospholipid), but is cleaved by thrombin to form two fragments which are identical by electrophoresis, ion exchange chromatography, and amino acid composition to Fragment 1, the fragment released from prothrombin on incubation with thrombin, and Fragment 2, the fragment released by activated Factor X when Intermediate 1 is converted to Intermediate 2 (Paper I; Owen, W. G., Esmon, C. T., and Jackson, C. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 594–605). It is proposed that the formation of Intermediate 1 during prothrombin activation is solely the result of thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis of prothrombin."

Upon reduction to the ferrous form the Soret band shifts to 411 nm, and on addition of CO, to 446 nm. An enzymatically inactive cytochrome forms on treatment of P-450cam with mercurial compounds, acetone, sodium deoxycholate, or urea; all possess ferrous CO Soret absorption at 420 nm. All these biologically inactive forms are termed P-420. They are reconverted to the catalytically active P-450cam by treatment with sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine, thioglycolic acid, β-mercaptoethanol, or dithioerythritol. Six sulfhydryl groups can be titrated with p-chloromercuribenzoate, corresponding to the total of 6 cysteine residues found by amino acid analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2006626988,"The activity of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in plasma ranged from 2 to 100 units per liter of plasma in 82 apparently healthy subjects (ages 22 to 35 years). A nonnormal pattern of distribution was evident: 62 subjects had values below 35 units (18 +/- 1), while 13 of the remaining 20 subjects had values above 60 units (80 +/- 5). Those with low DBH activity had lower values for urinary catecholamine excretion (31 +/- 3 micrograms), with normal and stable blood pressure; those with high DBH activity had higher values for urinary catecholamine excretion (72 +/- 6 micrograms), with greater lability of arterial blood pressure. The DBH activity was significantly elevated in patients with labile (74 +/- 2 mm-Hg) or fixed (57 +/- 2 mm-Hg) essential hypertension. The results indicate that plasma DBH activity is low and that it falls within a narrow range in young adults with normal and stable blood pressure."

Chrysene and the six isomeric methylchrysenes were obtained in high purity (> 99.9 percent); they were tested on mouse skin for tumor initiating activity and carcinogenicity.

https://openalex.org/W1481851611,"Abstract Factor VII has been purified up to 330,000-fold from bovine plasma by adsorption on, and elution from, barium sulfate, anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography on benzamidine coupled to Sepharose. The purified material is inhibited by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate both in its native state and after the formation of a complex with tissue factor in the presence of calcium ions. The Factor VII-tissue factor complex, unlike native Factor VII, has coagulant activity; this activity results in a complex proteolytic activation of Factor X to Xa, as shown by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and by assay of the Factor Xa produced. It has been concluded that Factor VII, unlike Factor X and prothrombin, circulates in the plasma as an active enzyme which has an absolute requirement for tissue factor in order to develop proteolytic activity towards Factor X."

https://openalex.org/W1511614262,"Abstract The iodination of zinc-free insulin was catalyzed by lactoperoxidase, and monoiodoinsulin was purified from the reaction mixture by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex (A-25). This fraction was demonstrated to be essentially pure by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, specific radioactivity, and neutron activation analysis for iodine content. This derivative demonstrated the ultraviolet absorption characteristics expected of a monoiodotyrosyl insulin. Circular dichroic and immunological studies indicated no significant perturbations in the insulin molecule due to the attachment of iodine. Basic hydrolysis and subsequent amino acid analysis demonstrated that 85 to 90% of the total iodine was associated with 3-monoiodotyrosine, with the remaining iodine apparently associated with hydrolytic degradation products of 3-monoiodotyrosine. Oxidative sulfitolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the S-sulfo A and B chains indicated that this monoiodoinsulin was substituted predominantly (76%) on the tyrosine at position 14 of the A chain. The biological activity of monoiodoinsulin was indistinguishable from that of native insulin by the criterion of blood sugar depression in alloxan diabetic mice, and was 70 to 80% relative to insulin in the mouse convulsion assay. It therefore seems likely that the absolute integrity of tyrosine A14 is not required for the expression of the biological activity of insulin. A marked effect of zinc on both the immunological reactivity and near ultraviolet circular dichroism of insulin was noted during the course of this work. In addition, the effect of pH on the position of iodine substitution was examined, and a method is presented for the characterization of iodination reaction mixtures by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1601759090,"Abstract Adenylosuccinate synthetase has been purified more than 250-fold from extracts of rabbit muscle acetone powder by heating to 60°, ammonium sulfate fractionation, phosphocellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography, and Sephadex G-150 gel filtration. Crystals have been obtained by dialysis against 60 to 67% ammonium sulfate. Enzyme activity is stable for about 2 weeks in phosphate buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol; for longer periods, dialysis against saturated ammonium sulfate is preferable. The enzyme is quite basic, has a molecular weight of approximately 54,000, and does not appear to dissociate into subunits upon treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate or mercaptoethanol. A broad maximum in enzyme activity occurs at pH ∼ 6.6, and the kinetic parameters of the enzyme differ significantly from those of the Escherichia coli or Ehrlich ascites-tumor cell enzymes. Km values for IMP, GTP, and l-aspartate are 2 x 10-4 m, 1 x 10-5 m, and 3 x 10-4 m, respectively, for the muscle enzyme. GDP, AMP, adenylosuccinate, argininosuccinate, phosphate, arsenate, and sulfate inhibit enzyme activity. Enzyme activity is unaffected by incubation for 24 hours with EDTA, azide, and phenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride, but is completely destroyed by freezing or by 18-hours incubation with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Adenylosuccinate synthetase activity has also been found in crude extracts of acetone powders of rabbit heart, liver, kidney, brain, and lung."

https://openalex.org/W1552325000,"Abstract Amylosucrase (EC 2.4.1.4) was solubilized and purified more than 100-fold from Neisseria perflava cells. Preparations had a specific activity of about 3 i.u. per mg of protein, were free of maltase and α-glucan phosphorylase activity, and converted sucrose to an amylaceous α-glucan, fructose, and minor amounts of maltosaccharides (Keq = 33, ΔG° = -2.1 Cal). Sugar nucleotide mediation was absent. Added UDP or ADP did not affect the conversion rate, or provide UDP- or ADP-[14C]glucose from [14C]sucrose even when polymerization was prevented by α-amylase. The α-glucan formed from sucrose was glycogen-like (e.g. 48% hydrolyzed to maltose by β-amylase). The branches may be produced in the usual way, assuming the amylosucrase preparations were contaminated with a dextrinyl transferring (branching) enzyme. It is possible, however, that amylosucrase itself may produce the entire glucan structure by a distinctive process involving α-d-glucosyl (monomer) transfer exclusively. Specificity of the enzyme for monomer was apparent as only α-d-glucosyl was transferred from amylopectin, maltoheptaose, and sucrose to [14C]fructose (forming labeled sucrose). The C4-linked α-maltosyl, α-maltotriosyl, etc., terminal segmers of the first two compounds and the α-maltosyl group of 4g α-d-glucosyl-sucrose were not transferred. α-Glucan synthesis by amylosucrase was found to require a primer. Onset of synthesis from sucrose free of amylaceous impurities was long delayed, and this delay was abolished by amylopectin or glycogen, 3 to 6 x 10-6 m end groups. Sucrose, with a donor affinity of Ks = 17 mm, appears to bind nonproductively at the acceptor site since high concentrations greatly depressed α-glucan synthesis (Kss = 0.3 m). In action on [14C]sucrose, amylosucrose produced α-glucan comprising 99.6% [14C]glucose and 0.4% primer; such evidence for [14C]glucose polymerization is lacking in reports of starch synthesis from sucrose by plant enzyme systems."

https://openalex.org/W1639831386,"The general picture that emerges from this study is that the woman microbiologist, upon entering the professional job market, faces (i) slower advancement; (ii) restricted extramural recognition; and (iii) fewer positions of a supervisory or administrative nature, when compared to men. Most striking is the salary differential, which increases with increasing educational level, with increasing rank, and with increasing seniority. From the beginning of her professional training, the woman microbiologist feels handicapped by lack of encouragement and proper role models. She generally receives little advice regarding her professional future and rarely feels pushed to take the most challenging position. Should she be married, she feels that her mobility is severely restricted. Even though the subjective nature of these feelings may be interpreted as projections of failure, subtle inducements for women to stay at lower levels may well exist, in addition to more objective measurements, such as lower salary levels and slower professional advancement. Despite these handicaps, professional women continue to work. As a group, they work for the same reasons that men do, they work as long and as hard as men do, and they remain at their positions as long as men do. Women and men rate themselves equally as to job performance, degree of independence, and publication rate. On the basis of this study, it should not be surprising that women professionals are less visible than men and that only a small proportion of women become what is considered successful by the usual external criteria. If women were to receive continued encouragement, scientific contact, and professional recognition at each stage of their professional lives, they would undoubtedly become more visible. The lack of encouragement and selfconfidence leading to isolation, which then leads to lack of recognition, is a vicious circle that must be broken for the woman professional. This can be done most easily for the beginning student. For older women, there must be increased placement in positions of responsibility and visibility. Protective practices that discourage women from entering arenas of competition can only be viewed as discrimination on the basis of sex, since women professionals are rarely given the choice between being protected and being independent. Unexpectedly, this study illustrates the lower status of another group of individuals who are considered deviants from the expected roles of the established society-single men with doctorates, who were found in the positions predominately filled by women. In conclusion, this study of a select group of scientists probably has general applicability to all women professionals in their roles vis-à-vis men. Examination and documentation of discriminatory practices based on sex points to the areas in which women must direct their demands for equality."
https://openalex.org/W1656438110,"Abstract Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase purified from Clostridium cylindrosporum and Clostridium acidi-urici exists as a catalytically active tetramer in the presence of specific monovalent cations or as an inactive monomer in their absence. Addition of monovalent cations to the dissociated enzyme causes the monomers to reassociate to the tetramer. The order of cation effectiveness is NH4+ g T1+ g Rb+ ∼ K+ g Cs+ g Na+ ∼ Li+. The rate and the extent of reactivation is influenced by the counter ion. Sulfate and phosphate, for example, stimulate reassociation while thiocyanate, trichloroacetate, and perchlorate completely inhibit the reaction. This effect is attributed to the ability of the anion to alter the iceberg structure of water which exists about exposed hydrophobic residues on the monomer. Increasing the ionic strength of the reaction medium results in an increase in both the rate and the extent of reassociation. Difference spectroscopy experiments suggest that aromatic amino acids are buried during reassociation. An investigation of the kinetics of cation-dependent subunit reassociation indicates that reactivation of monomers from C. cylindrosporum is second order with respect to monomer concentration, while reactivation of C. acidi-urici monomers is a first order process. It is proposed that the rate-determining step in the C. cylindrosporum case is the combination of two subunits to form a dimer; in the C. acidiurici case, a conformational change in the subunit, which is rate-limiting, must occur before reassociation is possible. The presence of MgATP at concentrations near its Michaelis constant greatly increases the rate of reassociation of monomers from C. acidi-urici. Preincubation of the monomers with MgATP results in a change in the kinetic order of cation-dependent reassociation from first to second order. This substrate, by binding to the monomer, evidently produces the conformational alteration required for reactivation. Low concentrations of MgATP have no effect on the reactivation of C. cylindrosporum monomers."
