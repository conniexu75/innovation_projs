https://openalex.org/W2084888861,"Nanog is a transcription factor required for maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and is not expressed in most normal adult tissues. However, recent studies have indicated that Nanog is overexpressed in many types of human cancers, including breast cancer. To elucidate the physiological roles of Nanog in tumorigenesis, we developed an inducible Nanog transgenic mouse model, in which the expression of Nanog in adult tissues can be induced via LoxP/Cre-mediated deletion. Our findings indicate that overexpression of Nanog in the mammary gland is not sufficient to induce mammary tumor. However, when coexpressed with Wnt-1 in the mouse mammary gland, it promotes mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this context, Nanog promotes the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Microarray analysis has shown that the ectopic expression of Nanog deregulates the expression of numerous genes associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis, such as the PDGFRα gene. Our findings demonstrate the involvement of Nanog in breast cancer metastasis, and provide the basis for the reported correlation between Nanog expression and poor prognosis of human breast cancer patients. As Nanog is not expressed in most adult tissues, these findings identify Nanog as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of Nanog-expressing metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2164166000,"Disruption of the histone modification patterns is one of the most common features of human tumors. However, few genetic alterations in the histone modifier genes have been described in tumorigenesis. Herein we show that the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 undergoes gene amplification in non-small and small lung cancer cell lines and primary tumors. The existence of additional copies of the SETDB1 gene in these transformed cells is associated with higher levels of the corresponding mRNA and protein. From a functional standpoint, the depletion of SETDB1 expression in amplified cells reduces cancer growth in cell culture and nude mice models, whereas its overexpression increases the tumor invasiveness. The increased gene dosage of SETDB1 is also associated with enhanced sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effect mediated by the SETDB1-interfering drug mithramycin. Overall, the findings identify SETDB1 as a bona fide oncogene undergoing gene amplification-associated activation in lung cancer and suggest its potential for new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2006566285,"DNA hypomethylation is a characteristic feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) immune cells. Numerous reports have implicated the involvement of the MEK/ERK pathway in the reduction of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression, hence inducing the transcription of methylation-sensitive genes in SLE patients. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac), which is overexpressed in SLE T-cells, contributes to reduced DNA methylation. We show that both chemical suppression and siRNA silencing of PP2Ac in T-cells resulted in sustained phosphorylation of MEK and ERK following stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. Furthermore, PP2Ac suppression resulted in increased DNMT enzyme activity, DNA hypermethylation, and decreased expression of methylation-sensitive genes. Similarly, in SLE T-cells, suppression of PP2Ac resulted in increased MEK/ERK phosphorylation, enhanced DNMT1 expression and suppressed expression of the methylation-sensitive CD70 gene. Our results demonstrate that PP2A regulates DNA methylation by influencing the phosphorylation of MEK/ERK. We propose that enhanced PP2Ac in SLE T-cells may dephosphorylate and activate the signaling pathway upstream of DNMT1, thus disturbing the tight control of methylation-sensitive genes, which are involved in SLE pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2013396614,"There are increasing reports of cognitive and psychological declines related to occupational stress in subjects without psychiatric premorbidity or major life trauma. The underlying neurobiology is unknown, and many question the notion that the described disabilities represent a medical condition. Using PET we recently found that persons suffering from chronic occupational stress had limbic reductions in the 5-HT1A receptor binding potential. Here we examine whether chronic work-related stress is also associated with changes in brain structure. We performed MRI-based voxel-based morphometry and structural volumetry in stressed subjects and unstressed controls focusing on gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes, and the volumes of hippocampus, caudate, and putamen – structures known to be susceptible to neurotoxic changes. Stressed subjects exhibited significant reductions in the GM volumes of the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, their caudate and putamen volumes were reduced, and the volumes correlated inversely to the degree of perceived stress. Our results add to previous data on chronic psychosocial stress, and indicate a morphological involvement of the frontostriatal circuits. The present findings of morphological changes in these regions confirm our previous conclusion that symptoms from occupational stress merit careful investigations and targeted treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2023948580,"There is considerable evidence to suggest that drug actions at the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) may represent a means to control pain perception and modulate reward thresholds. As a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the activation of KOR promotes Gαi/o protein coupling and the recruitment of β-arrestins. It has become increasingly evident that GPCRs can transduce signals that originate independently via G protein pathways and β-arrestin pathways; the ligand-dependent bifurcation of such signaling is referred to as “functional selectivity” or “signaling bias.” Recently, a KOR agonist, 6′-guanidinonaltrindole (6′-GNTI), was shown to display bias toward the activation of G protein-mediated signaling over β-arrestin2 recruitment. Therefore, we investigated whether such ligand bias was preserved in striatal neurons. Although the reference KOR agonist U69,593 induces the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, 6′-GNTI only activates the Akt pathway in striatal neurons. Using pharmacological tools and β-arrestin2 knock-out mice, we show that KOR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in striatal neurons requires β-arrestin2, whereas Akt activation depends upon G protein signaling. These findings reveal a point of KOR signal bifurcation that can be observed in an endogenous neuronal setting and may prove to be an important indicator when developing biased agonists at the KOR.Background: 6′-Guanidinonaltrindole (6′-GNTI) activates G protein coupling to κ-opioid receptors (KOR) without β-arrestin2 recruitment in transfected cells.Results: In striatal neurons, 6′-GNTI activates Akt but not ERK1/2; U69,593 activates both kinases.Conclusion: In neurons, U69,593-induced activation of ERK1/2 is β-arrestin2-dependent, whereas activation of Akt is G protein-mediated.Significance: Identification of KOR signaling pathways in endogenous systems will inform the development of KOR-directed medications.

In particular, the dynorphin/KOR system has been shown to modulate dopaminergic and serotonergic tone in the CNS and therefore has become a favorable target for drug discovery efforts aimed at treating addiction and mood disorders. Current KOR ligands are limited by unwanted side effects and unusual pharmacodynamics. KOR agonists, for example, have been shown to decrease the reinforcing and rewarding effects of abused drugs (1.Glick S.D. Maisonneuve I.M. Raucci J. Archer S.

Therefore, the question remains as to how this receptor should be acted upon to mediate the desired effects while limiting undesired consequences, whether that be through the use of partial agonists or functionally selective agonists or antagonists. Functional selectivity, biased agonism, and ligand-directed signaling conceptually describe the condition wherein ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) promotes receptor coupling to certain signaling cascades preferentially over others (16.Kenakin T.

Sci. 2007; 28: 390-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and evidence of ligand-directed signaling at the KOR has been reported. For example, U69,593 and MOM-salvinorin B differ in their ability to induce astrocyte proliferation and in the temporal activation of ERK1/2 observed in astrocytes following drug treatment. In these cells, U69,593 activates ERK1/2 via both early phase G protein-dependent and later β-arrestin2-dependent mechanisms, the latter of which was correlated with astrocyte proliferation. In contrast, MOM-salvinorin B only activates the early G protein-dependent ERK1/2 pathway and does not induce astrocyte proliferation (21.McLennan G.P. Kiss A. Miyatake M. Belcheva M.M. Chambers K.T.

Neurochem. 2008; 107: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In another demonstration of functional selectivity at KOR, the classic KOR antagonists norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) and JDTic were shown to antagonize G protein coupling but activate the MAP kinase JNK in a KOR-mediated manner (22.Bruchas M.R. Yang T. Schreiber S. Defino M. Kwan S.C. Li S. Chavkin C. Long-acting kappa opioid antagonists disrupt receptor signaling and produce noncompetitive effects by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase.J.

It is currently hypothesized that functional selectivity results from ligands directly influencing the conformation of the receptor and thereby directing selective interactions with particular second messenger systems. When coupled with molecular modeling studies and the introduction of the recent crystal structure of KOR, the characterization of KOR ligands that promote distinct pharmacological profiles may lead to structure-function-inspired drug design (23.Negri A.

Jones R.M. Metzger T.G. Ferguson D.M. Portoghese P.S. Transformation of a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist to a kappa-agonist by transfer of a guanidinium group from the 5′- to 6′-position of naltrindole.J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as a guanidino derivative of the selective δ-opioid receptor (DOR) antagonist naltrindole. Interestingly, the addition of a guanidino group to naltrindole converts it to a KOR-selective compound, and moving the guanidino group from the 5′ to 6′ position changes the ligand from a KOR antagonist (5′-GNTI) to a KOR agonist (6′-GNTI). Initially, 6′-GNTI agonist activity at KOR was demonstrated by showing that 6′-GNTI-induced inhibition of smooth muscle contraction in the guinea pig ileum could be selectively blocked by nor-BNI (26.Sharma S.K. Jones R.M. Metzger T.G. Ferguson D.M. Portoghese P.S. Transformation of a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist to a kappa-agonist by transfer of a guanidinium group from the 5′- to 6′-position of naltrindole.J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, 6′-GNTI was reported to partially activate G protein-mediated signaling pathways without inducing β-arrestin2 recruitment in HEK-293 cells (27.Rives M.L. Rossillo M. Liu-Chen L.Y. Javitch J.A. 6′-Guanidinonaltrindole (6′-GNTI) is a G protein-biased κ-opioid receptor agonist that inhibits arrestin recruitment.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27050-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These findings make 6′-GNTI of great interest for dissecting the roles of different KOR signaling cascades as well as KOR drug development for the treatment of pain and addiction. In the present study, we sought to further characterize the pharmacological properties of 6′-GNTI in multiple signaling pathways in both KOR-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and primary neuronal cultures where the KOR is expressed endogenously. We confirm that in CHO cells, 6′-GNTI is a potent partial agonist in G protein signaling and that it antagonizes β-arrestin2 recruitment to the KOR and receptor internalization (27.Rives M.L. Rossillo M. Liu-Chen L.Y. Javitch J.A. 6′-Guanidinonaltrindole (6′-GNTI) is a G protein-biased κ-opioid receptor agonist that inhibits arrestin recruitment.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27050-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although 6′-GNTI does not recruit β-arrestins, it does induce the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, suggesting that these kinases are activated independent of KOR/β-arrestin2 interactions. However, when we assessed kinase activation profiles in primary striatal neurons, we found that only U69,593 is able to induce ERK1/2 activation and it does so in a β-arrestin2-dependent and pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Conversely, both U69,593 and 6′-GNTI induce Akt phosphorylation in striatal neurons, activation that is blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. These results indicate that 6′-GNTI is a functionally selective ligand at the endogenously expressed KOR. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human KOR in pcDNA3.1(+) (Gene ID 4986, Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center, Rolla, MO) by electroporation (GenePulser XCell, Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were selected via HA-antibody cell sorting by flow cytometry (FACSAria and LSRII, BD Biosciences), and the top 3% expression level cell population was used for all experiments. CHO-KOR cells were characterized for KOR membrane expression via confocal microscopy and total receptor number determined by [3H]U69,593 saturation binding (KD ∼ 0.6 nm, Bmax ∼ 1800 fmol/mg protein) (28.Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T. Enhanced morphine analgesia in mice lacking beta-arrestin 2.Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). For all experiments with the CHO-KOR line, untransfected CHO cells served as negative controls (data not shown). U69,593 was obtained from Sigma, and nor-BNI dihydrochloride, 5′-GNTI ditrifluoroacetate, and 6′-GNTI ditrifluoroacetate were all obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). U69,593 was prepared in ethanol, 6′-GNTI and 5′-GNTI were prepared in DMSO, and nor-BNI was prepared in dH2O. In all cases, vehicle contained 1% DMSO and 1% ethanol in PBS (unless stated otherwise in the figure legends). Pertussis toxin from Bordetella pertussis was obtained from Sigma. β-Arrestin2 knock-out (βarr2-KO) and wild-type (WT) littermates were used to assess [35S]GTPγS coupling in mouse brain and for the culturing of primary neurons (28.Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T. Enhanced morphine analgesia in mice lacking beta-arrestin 2.Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Scripps Research Institute. CHO-KOR cells were collected, and membrane pellets were prepared by homogenization with a polytronic Tissue-Tearor in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) followed by 20,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min. The resultant membrane pellet was resuspended in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 40 μm GDP) via Teflon-on-glass Dounce homogenizer. Fifteen μg of membrane protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of drug and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 30 °C in a total reaction volume of 200 μl. For antagonist experiments, protein was preincubated with test compounds for 15 min prior to the addition of 100 nm U69,593 and [35S]GTPγS. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration using a 96-well plate Brandel cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) followed by washes with ice cold water. Microscint-20 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the plates after drying, and radioactivity was read with a TopCount NXT HTS microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All compounds were run in parallel assays in duplicate for comparison. For coupling in mouse brain, striata were isolated from 4–5-month-old male WT mice. Tissue was homogenized, and membranes were prepared as described above. Coupling reactions, containing 2.5 μg of protein, 20 μm GDP, and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS, were incubated at room temperature for 2 h prior to harvesting, as described above. To visually assess β-arrestin2 translocation to the KOR, CHO-KOR cells were transiently transfected with βarr2-GFP (5 μg) by electroporation and plated on collagen-coated glass-bottom confocal dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for 1 h in serum-free MEM without phenol red (Invitrogen). Drugs were added, and live cell images were obtained at the time points indicated using an Olympus FluoView IX81 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) as described previously (29.Bohn L.M. Dykstra L.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Relative opioid efficacy is determined by the complements of the G protein-coupled receptor desensitization machinery.Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2 translocation was also studied using the PathHunter® β-arrestin assay in CHO-K1 cells expressing the KOR (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with agonist for 90 min prior to assessment of enzyme complementation. For antagonist experiments, the cells were incubated with the antagonist for 60 min prior to agonist addition. Luminescence values were obtained using a Synergy HT luminometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All compounds were run in parallel experiments in duplicate. To qualitatively determine agonist-induced receptor internalization, CHO-KOR cells were plated on collagen-coated glass-bottom confocal dishes and serum-starved for 30 min prior to the experiment. The KOR was labeled in live cells by incubation with an anti-HA-AlexaFluor 488 antibody (1:100, Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C. Following washes, drug (10 μm) was added, and the cells were monitored by confocal imaging for HA-KOR internalization over the times indicated (29.Bohn L.M. Dykstra L.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G.

Agonist-induced KOR internalization was also assessed in CHO-KOR cells using a cell surface biotinylation assay. This assay was performed as described previously (30.Groer C.E. Tidgewell K.

Drug was added at 10 μm, and cells were treated for 30 min or 1 h (30 min for the antagonist and then 30 min for the agonist, where applicable). The remaining surface biotinylation was removed by glutathione-stripping buffer, and the protected biotinylation was immunoprecipitated by streptavidin-coated beads. Western blots were performed as described previously with 10% bis-Tris NuPage gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (18.Schmid C.L. Bohn L.M.

Blots were imaged using the Odyssey infrared imager, and densitometry of bands was measured using Odyssey 2.1 software (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). The -fold stimulation over vehicle was calculated by dividing the densitometry values of the treated groups by the average value of the vehicle-treated group. To assess agonist-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation via In-cell Western assay (Li-Cor), CHO-KOR cells were plated into 384-well clear-bottom, black-walled plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 15,000 cells/well. The cells were serum-starved for 1 h prior to treatment with increasing drug concentrations for 10 min. The cells were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS), washed in 0.1 m glycine, permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100), and blocked with Li-Cor blocking buffer in PBS (Li-Cor). Cells were then incubated with both phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 primary antibodies (p-ERK1/2, catalog No. 4370, at 1:300, and t-ERK1/2, catalog No. 4696, at 1:200; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) overnight in Li-Cor blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IRDye800 and anti-mouse IRDye680, both at 1:500; Li-Cor) were added in Li-Cor blocking buffer + 0.025% Tween 20. Fluorescence was determined using the Odyssey infrared imager. The -fold ERK1/2 phosphorylation over vehicle levels was determined by first normalizing phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels to total ERK1/2 levels within each well and then normalizing to the average of the vehicle treated cells within each experiment. All compounds were run in parallel with 6 replicate wells per point. CHO-KOR cells were plated in 6-well dishes and serum-starved for 1 h in serum-free medium prior to treatment. Concentrations and durations of treatment are indicated in the legends for FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5. For antagonist studies, nor-BNI was added during the last 15 min of the serum starvation. For pertussis toxin pretreatment studies, 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin was added to the complete medium at ∼24 h prior to the assay. Following treatment, cells were washed once in PBS, and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors). Western blots were performed to assess phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog No. 4370), total ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog No. 4696), phospho-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog No. 2965), and total Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog No. 2920) levels as described above.FIGURE 46′-GNTI-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in CHO-KOR cells is pertussis toxin-sensitive. CHO-KOR cells were serum-starved for 1 h prior to drug treatment and the determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Representative images of plates or Western blots and densitometric analyses are provided. For each sample, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) was first normalized to total ERK1/2 (t-ERK1/2) and the -fold stimulation over vehicle or basal is provided (mean ± S.E.). A, following treatment with increasing concentrations of drug for 10 min, -fold stimulation was determined by immunocytochemistry in a 384-well plate format (In-cell Western). 6′-GNTI induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation to a similar extent as U69,593 (two-way ANOVA for drug: F(1,108) = 0.07, p = 0.7919; for concentration: F(7,108) = 79.85, p < 0.0001). 5′-GNTI does not induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation (n = 9 (U69,593 and 6′-GNTI) and n = 5 (5′-GNTI) performed in replicates of six). B, both U69,593-induced (U69, 10 μm for 10 min) and 6′-GNTI-induced (6′, 10 μm for 10 min) ERK1/2 phosphorylation are sensitive to pretreatment with nor-BNI (Nor; 10 μm for 15 min) as determined by Western blot analysis (one-way ANOVA: F(5,41) = 79.49, p < 0.0001; Bonferroni's post hoc test: vehicle versus drug treatment, ***, p < 0.001, U69,593 versus nor-BNI+U69,593, ^^^, p < 0.001, 6′-GNTI versus nor-BNI+6′-GNTI, ###, p < 0.001; n = 4 independent experiments). C, time course analysis of the 10 μm concentrations of U69,593 and 6′-GNTI reveals that ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels remain elevated for up to 2 h post-treatment with either ligand (one-way ANOVA: for U69,593, F(5,27) = 7.886, p < 0.0001; for 6′-GNTI, F(5,27) = 9.619, p < 0.0001; Bonferroni's post hoc test: basal versus U69,593, *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001, basal versus 6′-GNTI, ^, p < 0.05, ^^^, p < 0.001). U69,593 and 6′-GNTI do not induce any significant differences between their time courses of activation (two-way ANOVA for drug: F(1,54) = 3.17, p = 0.0805; for time: F(5,54) = 16.65, p < 0.0001; n = 4 independent experiments). D, U69,593- and 6′-GNTI-induced (10 μm for 10 min) ERK1/2 phosphorylation can be blocked by an overnight pretreatment (100 ng/ml) with pertussis toxin (PTX) (Student's t test: vehicle (veh) versus drug treatment, ***, p < 0.001; n = 3 independent experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Primary striatal neuronal cultures were generated from postnatal day 1 mouse neonates obtained from homozygous breeding of βarr2-KO and WT mice.

https://openalex.org/W2113825185,"There is extensive evidence implicating the intestinal microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], but no microbial agent has been identified as a sole causative agent. Bacteroidales are numerically dominant intestinal organisms that associate with the mucosal surface and have properties that both positively and negatively affect the host. To determine precise numbers and species of Bacteroidales adherent to the mucosal surface in IBD patients, we performed a comprehensive culture based analysis of intestinal biopsies from pediatric Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative colitis [UC], and control subjects. We obtained biopsies from 94 patients and used multiplex PCR or 16S rDNA sequencing of Bacteroidales isolates for species identification. Eighteen different Bacteroidales species were identified in the study group, with up to ten different species per biopsy, a number higher than demonstrated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. Species diversity was decreased in IBD compared to controls and with increasingly inflamed tissue. There were significant differences in predominant Bacteroidales species between biopsies from the three groups and from inflamed and uninflamed sites. Parabacteroides distasonis significantly decreased in inflamed tissue. All 373 Bacteroidales isolates collected in this study grew with mucin as the only utilizable carbon source suggesting this is a non-pathogenic feature of this bacterial order. Bacteroides fragilis isolates with the enterotoxin gene [bft], previously associated with flares of colitis, were not found more often at inflamed colonic sites or within IBD subjects. B. fragilis isolates with the ability to synthesize the immunomodulatory polysaccharide A [PSA], previously shown to be protective in murine models of colitis, were not detected more often from healthy versus inflamed tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2076501098,"Animal movement and behaviour is fundamental for ecosystem functioning. The process of seed dispersal by frugivorous animals is a showcase for this paradigm since their behaviour shapes the spatial patterns of the earliest stage of plant regeneration. However, we still lack a general understanding of how intrinsic (frugivore and plant species traits) and extrinsic (landscape features) factors interact to determine how seeds of a given species are more likely to be deposited in some places more than in others. We develop a multi-species mechanistic model of seed dispersal based on frugivore behavioural responses to landscape heterogeneity. The model was fitted to data from three-years of spatially-explicit field observations on the behaviour of six frugivorous thrushes and the fruiting patterns of three fleshy-fruited trees in a secondary forest of the Cantabrian range (N Spain). With such model we explore how seed rain patterns arise from the interaction between animal behaviour and landscape heterogeneity. We show that different species of thrushes respond differently to landscape heterogeneity even though they belong to the same genus, and that provide complementary seed dispersal functions. Simulated seed rain patterns are only realistic when at least some landscape heterogeneity (forest cover and fruit abundance) is taken into account. The common and simple approach of re-sampling movement data to quantify seed dispersal produces biases in both the distance and the habitat at which seeds arrive. Movement behaviour not only affects dispersal distance and seed rain patterns but also can affect frugivore diet composition even if there is no built-in preference for fruiting species. In summary, the fate of seeds produced by a given plant species is strongly affected by both the composition of the frugivore assemblage and the landscape-scale context of the plant location, including the presence of fruits from other plants (from the same or different species)."
https://openalex.org/W2079819818,"The ribosomal gene RPS14 is associated with the cancer-prone 5q-syndrome, which is caused by an interstitial deletion of the long arm of human chromosome 5. Previously, we found that ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14) binds to and inactivates MDM2, consequently leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and growth inhibition. However, it remains elusive whether RPS14 regulates cell proliferation in a p53-independent manner. Here, we show that RPS14 interacts with the Myc homology box II (MBII) and the C-terminal basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) domains of the oncoprotein c-Myc. Further, RPS14 inhibited c-Myc transcriptional activity by preventing the recruitment of c-Myc and its cofactor, TRRAP, to the target gene promoters, as thus suppressing c-Myc-induced cell proliferation. Also, siRNA-mediated RPS14 depletion elevated c-Myc transcriptional activity determined by its target gene, Nucleolin, expression. Interestingly, RPS14 depletion also resulted in the induction of c-Myc mRNA and subsequent protein levels. Consistent with this, RPS14 promoted c-Myc mRNA turnover through an Argonaute 2 (Ago2)- and microRNA-mediated pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates that RPS14 negates c-Myc functions by directly inhibiting its transcriptional activity and mediating its mRNA degradation via miRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2094201432,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) recurrence can be due to reinfection or relapse. The contribution of each to TB incidence and the factors associated with recurrence are not well known. Effectiveness of TB control programs is assessed in part by recurrence rates. The aim of this study was to establish the recurrence rate of TB in Barcelona, the associated risk factors and the role of reinfection. Methods A population-based retrospective longitudinal study was performed in Barcelona, Spain. TB patients with positive culture results who completed treatment between Jan 1st, 2003 and Dec 31st, 2006 were followed-up until December 31st, 2009 by the TB Control Program. The incidence rate of recurrence was calculated per person-year of follow-up (py). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used for the survival analysis by calculating the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of the 1,823 TB cases identified, 971 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 13 (1.3%) had recurrent TB. The recurrence rate was 341 cases per 100,000 py, 13 times higher than the TB incidence of the general population. Likelihood of TB recurrence at the 1st, 3rd and 5th year of follow-up was 0.1%, 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. Factors associated with recurrence were HIV infection (HR: 4.7, CI: 1.4–15.7), living in the inner city district (HR: 3.9, CI: 1.3–11.8) and history of TB treatment (HR: 5.2, CI: 1.7–16.2). Genotyping results of recurrent cases were available for 6 patients (3 reinfections and 3 relapses). Conclusion The rate of TB recurrence in Barcelona is low and most episodes occur within the first three years. Patients at higher risk of recurrence are co-infected with HIV, living in neighborhoods with high TB incidence or with a history of TB treatment. When available, genotyping results help determine whether the recurrence is due to reinfection or relapse."
https://openalex.org/W1977295940,"Material punishment has been suggested to play a key role in sustaining human cooperation. Experimental findings, however, show that inflicting mere material costs does not always increase cooperation and may even have detrimental effects. Indeed, ethnographic evidence suggests that the most typical punishing strategies in human ecologies (e.g., gossip, derision, blame and criticism) naturally combine normative information with material punishment. Using laboratory experiments with humans, we show that the interaction of norm communication and material punishment leads to higher and more stable cooperation at a lower cost for the group than when used separately. In this work, we argue and provide experimental evidence that successful human cooperation is the outcome of the interaction between instrumental decision-making and the norm psychology humans are provided with. Norm psychology is a cognitive machinery to detect and reason upon norms that is characterized by a salience mechanism devoted to track how much a norm is prominent within a group. We test our hypothesis both in the laboratory and with an agent-based model. The agent-based model incorporates fundamental aspects of norm psychology absent from previous work. The combination of these methods allows us to provide an explanation for the proximate mechanisms behind the observed cooperative behaviour. The consistency between the two sources of data supports our hypothesis that cooperation is a product of norm psychology solicited by norm-signalling and coercive devices."
https://openalex.org/W2090052787,"Members of the rhodophytan order Cyanidiales are unique among phototrophs in their ability to live in extremely low pH levels and moderately high temperatures. The photosynthetic apparatus of the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae represents an intermediate type between cyanobacteria and higher plants, suggesting that this alga may provide the evolutionary link between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs. Although we now have a detailed structural model of photosystem II (PSII) from cyanobacteria at an atomic resolution, no corresponding structure of the eukaryotic PSII complex has been published to date. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a highly active and robust dimeric PSII complex from C. merolae. We show that this complex is highly stable across a range of extreme light, temperature, and pH conditions. By measuring fluorescence quenching properties of the isolated C. merolae PSII complex, we provide the first direct evidence of pH-dependent non-photochemical quenching in the red algal PSII reaction center. This type of quenching, together with high zeaxanthin content, appears to underlie photoprotection mechanisms that are efficiently employed by this robust natural water-splitting complex under excess irradiance. In order to provide structural details of this eukaryotic form of PSII, we have employed electron microscopy and single particle analyses to obtain a 17 Å map of the C. merolae PSII dimer in which we locate the position of the protein mass corresponding to the additional extrinsic protein stabilizing the oxygen-evolving complex, PsbQ'. We conclude that this lumenal subunit is present in the vicinity of the CP43 protein, close to the membrane plane."
https://openalex.org/W1969831116,"Sclerotinia rot caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is one of the most serious diseases of oilseed rape. To understand the resistance mechanisms in the Brassica napus to S. sclerotiorum, comparative disease progression, histological and proteomic studies were conducted of two B. napus genotypes (resistant cv. Charlton, susceptible cv. RQ001-02M2). At 72 and 96 h post inoculation (hpi), lesion size on cotyledons was significantly (P≤0.001) smaller in the resistant Charlton. Anatomical investigations revealed impeded fungal growth (at 24 hpi and onwards) and hyphal disintegration only on resistant Charlton. Temporal changes (12, 24, 48 and 72 hpi) in protein profile showed certain enzymes up-regulated only in resistant Charlton, such as those related to primary metabolic pathways, antioxidant defence, ethylene biosynthesis, pathogenesis related proteins, protein synthesis and protein folding, play a role in mediating defence responses against S. sclerotiorum. Similarly a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A enzyme with increased abundance in susceptible RQ001-02M2 and decreased levels in resistant Charlton has a role in increased susceptibility to this pathogen. This is the first time that the expression of these enzymes has been shown to be associated with mediating the defence response against S. sclerotinia in cotyledon tissue of a resistant cultivar of B. napus at a proteomics level. This study not only provides important new insights into the resistance mechanisms within B. napus against S. sclerotiorum, but opens the way for novel engineering of new B. napus varieties that over-express these key enzymes as a strategy to enhance resistance and better manage this devastating pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1972495045,"Responses to low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) are essential to maintain homeostasis. During the hypoxic response, gene expression is altered by various transcription factors. The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), plays a central role in the hypoxic response. The α subunit of HIF, which is actively degraded during normoxia, becomes stabilized during hypoxia, which leads to HIF activation. A microarray analysis of HeLa cells showed that expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) was markedly induced during prolonged hypoxia. CREB and NF-κB binding sites were identified in the MMP1 promoter region between 1945 and 1896 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. Assays with luciferase reporters demonstrated that HIF activity was induced during the early phase of hypoxia, whereas CREB and NF-κB were activated during the later (prolonged) phase. Depletion of CREB and/or NF-κB reduced MMP1 induction during prolonged hypoxia both at the mRNA and protein levels. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated binding of CREB and NF-κB to the MMP1 promoter. Finally, cell migration and invasion on a collagen matrix and pulmonary metastasis in nude mice were inhibited after depletion of CREB and NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the cooperative action of CREB and NF-κB plays an important role to induce MMP1 expression during prolonged hypoxia and regulates cell migration and invasion in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2154565292,"Caveolin-1 exhibits a stage-dependent, functional fluctuation during pancreatic cancer development, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that cavin-1, a structural protein of caveolae, modulates the oncogenic function of caveolin-1 and cooperates with caveolin-1 to enhance pancreatic cancer aggressiveness. Cavin-1 expression is associated with caveolin-1 in pancreatic cancer tissue samples and cell lines, and predicts the metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer. Interactome analyses further revealed the physical interaction of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 and their colocalization in pancreatic cancer cells. Cavin-1 stabilizes caveolin-1 expression or activity by inhibiting its internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation. More in-depth functional experiments showed that caveolin-1-enhanced aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer cells is dependent on the presence of cavin-1. In contrast, cavin-1 depletion inhibited the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells, which could not be restored by caveolin-1-rescue construct. Tissue microarray analyses in two independent clinic cohorts also supported the augment of cavin-1 on the prognostic potency of caveolin-1, and showed that combination of cavin-1 with caveolin-1 predicted worse survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Of note, the phenotypes because of cavin-1 could not be achieved by other cavins such as cavin-2, and the tumor-promoting role of cavin-1 in pancreatic cancer was found to be largely dependent on caveolin-1 expression, which highlights the critical role of cavin-1/caveoin-1 in pancreatic cancer progression, and suggests that the interruption of cavin-1/caveolin-1 interaction is a promising therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2063047521,"Background Adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater are classified as biliary cancers, though the exact epithelium of origin for these cancers is not known. We sought to molecularly classify ampullary adenocarcinomas in comparison to known adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, bile duct, and duodenum by gene expression analysis. Methods We analyzed 32 fresh-frozen resected, untreated periampullary adenocarcinomas (8 pancreatic, 2 extrahepatic biliary, 8 duodenal, and 14 ampullary) using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 genome array. Unsupervised and supervised hierarchical clustering identified two subtypes of ampullary carcinomas that were molecularly and histologically characterized. Results Hierarchical clustering of periampullary carcinomas segregated ampullary carcinomas into two subgroups, which were distinctly different from pancreatic carcinomas. Non-pancreatic periampullary adenocarcinomas were segregated into two subgroups with differing prognoses: 5 year RFS (77% vs. 0%, p = 0.007) and 5 year OS (100% vs. 35%, p = 0.005). Unsupervised clustering analysis of the 14 ampullary samples also identified two subgroups: a good prognosis intestinal-like subgroup and a poor prognosis biliary-like subgroup with 5 year OS of 70% vs. 28%, P = 0.09. Expression of CK7+/CK20- but not CDX-2 correlated with these two subgroups. Activation of the AKT and MAPK pathways were both increased in the poor prognostic biliary-like subgroup. In an independent 80 patient ampullary validation dataset only histological subtype (intestinal vs. pancreaticobiliary) was significantly associated with OS in both univariate (p = 0.006) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.04). Conclusions Gene expression analysis discriminated pancreatic adenocarcinomas from other periampullary carcinomas and identified two prognostically relevant subgroups of ampullary adenocarcinomas. Histological subtype was an independent prognostic factor in ampullary adenocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2159175063,"Delusions are the persistent and often bizarre beliefs that characterise psychosis. Previous studies have suggested that their emergence may be explained by disturbances in prediction error-dependent learning. Here we set up complementary studies in order to examine whether such a disturbance also modulates memory reconsolidation and hence explains their remarkable persistence. First, we quantified individual brain responses to prediction error in a causal learning task in 18 human subjects (8 female). Next, a placebo-controlled within-subjects study of the impact of ketamine was set up on the same individuals. We determined the influence of this NMDA receptor antagonist (previously shown to induce aberrant prediction error signal and lead to transient alterations in perception and belief) on the evolution of a fear memory over a 72 hour period: they initially underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning; 24 hours later, during ketamine or placebo administration, the conditioned stimulus (CS) was presented once, without reinforcement; memory strength was then tested again 24 hours later. Re-presentation of the CS under ketamine led to a stronger subsequent memory than under placebo. Moreover, the degree of strengthening correlated with individual vulnerability to ketamine's psychotogenic effects and with prediction error brain signal. This finding was partially replicated in an independent sample with an appetitive learning procedure (in 8 human subjects, 4 female). These results suggest a link between altered prediction error, memory strength and psychosis. They point to a core disruption that may explain not only the emergence of delusional beliefs but also their persistence."

Identification of new molecular mechanisms that regulate PCa initiation and progression would provide targets for the development of new cancer treatments. The Foxm1 transcription factor is highly up-regulated in tumor cells, inflammatory cells, and cells of tumor microenvironment. However, its functions in different cell populations of PCa lesions are unknown. To determine the role of Foxm1 in tumor cells during PCa development, we generated two novel transgenic mouse models, one exhibiting Foxm1 gain-of-function and one exhibiting Foxm1 loss-of-function under control of the prostate epithelial-specific Probasin promoter. In the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model of PCa that uses SV40 large T antigen to induce PCa, loss of Foxm1 decreased tumor growth and metastasis. Decreased prostate tumorigenesis was associated with a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and the down-regulation of genes critical for cell proliferation and tumor metastasis, including Cdc25b, Cyclin B1, Plk-1, Lox, and Versican. In addition, tumor-associated angiogenesis was decreased, coinciding with reduced Vegf-A expression.

Significance: Foxm1 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer in human patients. Development of cancer is a multistep process involving gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes leading to increased cell proliferation and survival (1.McCormick F. Signalling networks that cause cancer.Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M53-M56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cancer progression also requires inactivation of tumor suppressor genes that arrest cell proliferation in response to oncogenic stimuli (2.Sherr C.J. McCormick F.

Altered cell-cycle control is therefore likely to play a role in progression of disease, whereas deregulation of apoptosis may be more important for advanced carcinoma.

Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway drives cell cycle progression by regulating the temporal expression of cyclin regulatory subunits that activate their corresponding cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) through complex formation. Cdk-cyclin complexes phosphorylate and activate a variety of cell cycle regulatory proteins, including Foxm1 (1.McCormick F.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells, expression of the Foxm1 is induced during the G1/S-phase of the cell cycle and its expression continues throughout mitosis. Foxm1 directly stimulates the transcription of genes essential for progression into DNA replication and mitosis, including Cyclin B1, Cdc25B phosphatase, Aurora B kinase, and Polo-like kinase 1 (12.Costa R.H.

Prostate cancer (PCa) continues to be the most common malignancy diagnosed in American men and the second leading cause of male cancer mortality (20.Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Murray T. Thun M.J. Cancer statistics, 2008.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2008; 58: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10205) Google Scholar). Major efforts have been directed toward identifying early detection and prognostic markers for PCa. In contrast, significantly less research has been devoted to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa pathogenesis. Identification of genes regulating the initiation and/or progression of PCa would provide novel targets for diagnosis and treatment of human PCa. The transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) recapitulates multiple stages of human PCa by using the probasin promoter to drive the expression of the SV40 virus large T antigen (Tag) oncoprotein specifically in prostate epithelial cells (21.Abate-Shen C.

At early stages, TRAMP mice develop prostate epithelial cell hyperplasia and PIN, that progress to histopathologically invasive PCa (21.Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M.

Both the reproducibility and progressive nature of PCa development in the TRAMP mouse model has provided a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in PCa development and progression (25.Kasper S.

Indeed, overexpression of Foxm1 using the ubiquitous Rosa26 promoter accelerated tumor growth induced by SV40 T large/small t antigens (29.Kalin T.V. Wang I.C. Ackerson T.J. Major M.L. Detrisac C.J.

However, given that expression of the Rosa26-Foxm1 transgene was ubiquitous, the specific requirements for Foxm1 in different cell types of PCa remain unknown. The present study was designed to determine the cell autonomous role of Foxm1 in prostate epithelial cells during formation of prostate adenocarcinomas in vivo. Foxm1fl/fl mice (32.Krupczak-Hollis K.

Pb-Cretg/−/Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP mice were fertile with no obvious abnormalities. Pb-Cretg/−/Foxm1fl/fl, Foxm1fl/fl, and Pb-Cretg/−/TRAMP, TRAMP littermates were used as controls. Mouse prostate glands were harvested 8 and 23 weeks after birth and used for isolation of total prostate mRNA or for immunohistochemistry. Animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation. Transgenic mice with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Foxm1 expression (TetO-GFP-Foxm1-ΔN) were previously generated (34.Wang I.C. Snyder J. Zhang Y. Lander J. Nakafuku Y. Lin J. Chen G. Kalin T.V.

The TetO-GFP-FoxM1-ΔN mice were bred with Pb-Cretg/+/LoxP-stop-LoxP-rtTA(Rosa26)tg/tg mice, the latter of which contained a reverse tetracycline activator (rtTA) knocked into Rosa26 locus (35.Belteki G.

Conditional and inducible transgene expression in mice through the combinatorial use of Cre-mediated recombination and tetracycline induction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In Pb-Cretg/+/LoxP-stop-LoxP-rtTA(Rosa26)tg/+/TetO-GFP-FoxM1-ΔNtg/+ mice (abbreviated as Pb-Foxm1-ΔN), Dox treatment results in prostate epithelial-specific expression of the FoxM1-ΔN transgene due to excision of LoxP-stop-LoxP cassette by the Cre recombinase. To induce Foxm1-ΔN expression, mice were given Dox in food chow beginning at 4 weeks of age and kept on Dox until the end of the experiment. Dox-treated TetO-Foxm1-ΔN littermates lacking the Pb-Cre transgene were used as control for Pb-Foxm1-ΔN transgenic mice. Further controls included Pb-Cretg/−/TetO-Foxm1-ΔNtg/− or Pb-Foxm1-ΔN mice without Dox treatment. Pb-Foxm1-ΔN mice were bred with p19ARF−/− mice to generate Pb-Foxm1-ΔN/p19ARF+/− and Pb- Foxm1-ΔN/p19ARF−/− mice. To induce Foxm1 transgene, mice were given Dox at 6 weeks of age. Homozygous Pb-Foxm1-ΔN/p19ARF−/− mice developed aggressive lymphomas without Dox treatment (data not shown) and were not used to study prostate carcinogenesis. Heterozygous Pb-Foxm1-ΔN/p19ARF+]/− mice were treated with Dox for 23 weeks and harvested along with control Pb-Foxm1-ΔN and p19ARF+/− mice. The orthotopic model of prostate cancer, which uses Myc-CaP tumor cells, was previously described (36.Watson P.A. Ellwood-Yen K. King J.C. Wongvipat J. Lebeau M.M. Sawyers C.L.

Total RNA was prepared from prostates, and analyzed by qRT-PCR using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were amplified with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) combined with inventoried TaqMan mouse gene expression assays: Foxm1, Mm00514924_m1; β-Actin, Mm00607939_g1; Cdc25b, Mm00499136_m1; Cyclin B1, Mm00838401_g1; Plk1, Mm00440924_g1; Vegf-a, Mm00437304_m1; Foxf1, Mm00487497_m1; Hif1a, Mm00468869_m1; Spdef, Mm01306245_m1; Igf-1, Mm00439560_m1; Fzd1, Mm00445405_s1; CxcR4, Mm01996749_s1; AR, Mm00442688_m1; CxcL12, Mm00442688_m1; p19ARF, Mm00494449_m1. Human (transgenic) Foxm1-ΔN was amplified using Hs00153543_m1 primers. Reactions were analyzed in triplicates and expression levels were normalized to β-Actin. Cells were transfected using following Foxm1-specific siRNAs: siRNA #1, 5′-GGA CCA CUU CCC UUA CUU U-3′; siRNA #2, 5′-UAA UUA UGU CAA GAU GAUA-3′; siRNA #3, 5′-CCA UUA GGA AGA AGA AAU-3′ (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO). Cells were also transduced with shFoxm1 lentivirus (clone ID: V3LMM_457621, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg PA). TRAMP C2 mouse prostate adenocarcinoma cells were transfected with either CMV-Foxm1 or CMV-empty plasmids using the Neon transfection system following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde, sonicated, and used for immunoprecipitation with a Foxm1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (37.Balli D. Zhang Y. Snyder J. Kalinichenko V.V. Kalin T.V. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of transcription factor FoxM1 increases urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were between 500 and 1000 bp in size. Reversed cross-linked ChIP DNA samples were subjected to qPCR using oligonucleotides specific to promoter regions of mouse 11β-Hsd2: −706/−873 (5′-GAG ATG GAA AGG TCA ATG AAG GC-3′and 5′-CAT ACA CAC AGG GAG GGA AAT GC-3′) and −2366/−2480 (5′-GGA AAA GCA AGA AAG TGG AGC G-3′ and 5′-GGA GCC GAG ACA AAG GAT TCA G-3′). Binding of Foxm1 was normalized to DNA of the samples immunoprecipitated with isotype control serum. We used PCR of mouse genomic DNA to amplify the −2757 to −57 bp region of mouse 11β-Hsd2 promoter (GenBank number NC_000074.6) using the following primers: 5′-ctg agg tac ctg gtg cta gtg agt tac tgg tca c-3′ and 5′-GAC TCG AGG CTA GGA CAC GGA ATG-3′. To create the deletion mutants of the −2757 bp 11β-Hsd2 promoter region we used the following primers: −2267 bp, 5′-ctg agg tac cgg tct cct gac tta gaa aat ggg g-3′ and 5′-GAC TCG AGG CTA GGA CAC GGA ATG-3′; −1263 bp, 5′-ctg agg tac cgc tgt gat aag gaa tct atg acc c-3′ and 5′-GAC TCG AGG CTA GGA CAC GGA ATG-3′; −649 bp, 5′-ctg agg tac cta cca ggg acc taa ggc cat gcct-3′ and 5′-GAC TCG AGG CTA GGA CAC GGA ATG-3′. To mutate the potential Foxm1 binding site in the −879 to −892 bp region (5′-aca cac aaacaag-3′) of the mouse 11β-Hsd2 promoter we utilized the GeneArt Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) to completely eliminate the site without affecting neighboring sequences. The following primers were used: 5′-TGG CGC AGG GTG CCA GGC CAG GAC CTT CAT ACA CAC AGG GA-3′and 5′-TCC CTG TGT GTA TGA AGG TCC TGG CCT GGC ACC CTG CGC CA-3′. The PCR products was cloned into a pGL2-Basic firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) and verified by DNA sequencing. TRAMP C2 cells were transfected with CMV-Foxm1b or CMV-empty plasmids, as well as with LUC reporter driven by the −2.7-kb 11β-Hsd2 promoter region (11β-Hsd2-LUC) or the deletion mutants. CMV-Renilla was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. A dual luciferase assay (Promega) was performed 24 h after transfection as described previously (38.Kalin T.V.

We used Microsoft Excel to calculate S.D. and statistically significant differences between samples using the Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To investigate the role of Foxm1 in prostate epithelial cells during PCa formation, we generated transgenic mice containing LoxP-flanked exons 4–7 of the Foxm1 gene (Foxm1fl/fl) and the Probasin-Cre transgene (Pb-Cretg/−/Foxm1fl/fl mice). In Pb-Cretg/−/Foxm1fl/fl mice (Fig. 1A), Cre recombinase is specifically expressed in prostate epithelial cells under control of rat probasin (PB) promoter (33.Maddison L.A. Nahm H. DeMayo F.

To determine the efficiency of Foxm1 deletion, total prostate RNA from 8-week-old Pb-Cre/Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP male mice was examined by qRT-PCR. Compared with control Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP tissues, a 90% decrease in Foxm1 mRNA was only observed in prostate tissue, but not in lung tissues from Pb-Cre/Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP mice (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the deletion of Foxm1 was prostate-specific. The number of Foxm1-positive epithelial cells in Pb-Cre/Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP prostates was greatly reduced, confirming the efficient Foxm1 deletion by the Cre recombinase (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Moreover, the total number of Ki-67 positive cells and the number of Ki-67/Foxm1 double-positive epithelial cell were significantly decreased in Pb-Cre/Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP prostates (Fig. 1D, bottom panel), consistent with a down-regulation in cell proliferation. There were no differences in the number of apoptotic cells in Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP and Pb-Cre/Foxm1fl/fl/TRAMP prostates (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1976343688,"The competitive inhibitor cocaine and the non-competitive inhibitor ibogaine induce different conformational states of the human serotonin transporter. It has been shown from accessibility experiments that cocaine mainly induces an outward-facing conformation, while the non-competitive inhibitor ibogaine, and its active metabolite noribogaine, have been proposed to induce an inward-facing conformation of the human serotonin transporter similar to what has been observed for the endogenous substrate, serotonin. The ligand induced conformational changes within the human serotonin transporter caused by these three different types of ligands, substrate, non-competitive and competitive inhibitors, are studied from multiple atomistic molecular dynamics simulations initiated from a homology model of the human serotonin transporter. The results reveal that diverse conformations of the human serotonin transporter are captured from the molecular dynamics simulations depending on the type of the ligand bound. The inward-facing conformation of the human serotonin transporter is reached with noribogaine bound, and this state resembles a previously identified inward-facing conformation of the human serotonin transporter obtained from molecular dynamics simulation with bound substrate, but also a recently published inward-facing conformation of a bacterial homolog, the leucine transporter from Aquifex Aoelicus. The differences observed in ligand induced behavior are found to originate from different interaction patterns between the ligands and the protein. Such atomic-level understanding of how an inhibitor can dictate the conformational response of a transporter by ligand binding may be of great importance for future drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1966072670,"Across the animal kingdom, the involvement of insulin-like peptide (ILP) signaling in sex-related differentiation processes is attracting increasing attention. Recently, a gender-specific ILP was identified as the androgenic sex hormone in Crustacea. However, moieties modulating the actions of this androgenic insulin-like growth factor were yet to be revealed. Through molecular screening of an androgenic gland (AG) cDNA library prepared from the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus, we have identified a novel insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP) termed Cq-IGFBP. Based on bioinformatics analyses, the deduced Cq-IGFBP was shown to share high sequence homology with IGFBP family members from both invertebrates and vertebrates. The protein also includes a sequence determinant proven crucial for ligand binding, which according to three-dimensional modeling is assigned to the exposed outer surface of the protein. Recombinant Cq-IGFBP (rCq-IGFBP) protein was produced and, using a ""pulldown"" methodology, was shown to specifically interact with the insulin-like AG hormone of the crayfish (Cq-IAG). Particularly, using both mass spectral analysis and an immunological tool, rCq-IGFBP was shown to bind the Cq-IAG prohormone. Furthermore, a peptide corresponding to residues 23-38 of the Cq-IAG A-chain was found sufficient for in vitro recognition by rCq-IGFBP. Cq-IGFBP is the first IGFBP family member shown to specifically interact with a gender-specific ILP. Unlike their ILP ligands, IGFBPs are highly conserved across evolution, from ancient arthropods, like crustaceans, to humans. Such conservation places ILP signaling at the center of sex-related phenomena in early animal development."
https://openalex.org/W2035286023,"Objective Immune imbalance between regulatory T (Treg) and Th17 cells is a characteristic of systemic sclerosis (SSc). The functional heterogeneity among Treg can be elucidated by separating Treg into different subsets based on the expression of FoxP3 and CD45RA. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Treg subsets in the immune imbalance in naïve SSc. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 31 SSc patients and 33 healthy controls were analyzed for the expression of CD4, CD25, CD45RA, CTLA-4, FoxP3, and IL-17 using flow cytometry. Treg immunesuppression capacity was measured in co-culture experiments. The expression of FoxP3, CTLA-4, IL-17A, and RORC mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. Results The frequency of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells was significantly elevated in patients with SSc (3.62±1.14 vs 1.97±0.75, p<0.001) with diminished immunosuppression capacity. In SSc, the proportion of FoxP3highCD45RA− activated Treg cells (aTreg) was decreased, the proportion of FoxP3lowCD45RA− T cells was increased, and the proportion of FoxP3lowCD45RA+ resting Treg cells (rTreg) was decreased. The immune suppression capacity of aTreg and rTreg was diminished, while FoxP3lowCD45RA− T cells exhibited a lack of suppression capacity. The immune dysfunction of aTreg was accompanied by the abnormal expression of CTLA-4. Th17 cell numbers were elevated in SSc, FoxP3lowCD45RA− T cells produced IL-17, confirming their Th17 potential, which was consistent with the elevated levels of FoxP3+IL-17+ cells in SSc. Conclusion A decrease in aTreg levels, along with functional deficiency, and an increase in the proportion of FoxP3lowCD45RA− T cells, was the reason for the increase in dysfunctional Treg in SSc patients, potentially causing the immune imbalance between Treg and Th17 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2164047955,"Nrf2 is a redox-responsive transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of DC immune function. Loss of Nrf2 results in increased co-stimulatory molecule expression, enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in murine immature DCs (iDCs). It is unknown whether altered immune function of Nrf2-deficient DCs (Nrf2−/− iDCs) is due to elevated ROS levels. Furthermore, it is unclear which intracellular signaling pathways are involved in Nrf2-mediated regulation of DC function. Using antioxidant vitamins to reset ROS levels in Nrf2−/− iDCs, we show that elevated ROS is not responsible for the altered phenotype and function of these DCs. Pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the role of key MAPKs in mediating the altered phenotype and function in Nrf2−/− iDCs. We demonstrate that the increased co-stimulatory molecule expression (MHC II and CD86) and antigen-specific T cell activation capacity observed in Nrf2−/− iDCs was reversed by inhibition of p38 MAPK but not JNK. Importantly, we provide evidence for increased phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), transcription factors that are downstream of p38 MAPK.

Immature DCs (iDCs) express low levels of MHC II and other co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86, and CD40, with limited capacity to induce antigen-specific T-cell activation. DC maturation is associated with up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production, renders the DCs competent in T cell activation and elicitation of an immune response (1.Steinman R.M. Some interfaces of dendritic cell biology.APMIS. 2003; 111: 675-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The MAPKs represent vital intracellular signaling pathways that regulate a variety of cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. There are at least three distinct MAPK pathways in mammals, including extracellular signal-regulated 1/2 kinases (ERK1/2), JNK, and p38 MAPK (2.Chang L. Karin M.

However, it is not known whether the elevated ROS level, in the absence of Nrf2, is responsible for the changes in the DC immune function. Furthermore, it is not clear what signaling pathways are involved in mediating the changes observed in the absence of Nrf2. In this study, using Nrf2-deficient iDCs, we demonstrate that elevated ROS levels do not underlie altered immune function in these DCs. We also show that functional changes associated with the loss of Nrf2 in iDCs is sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK but not JNK activity. Importantly, we demonstrate that CREB and ATF1 are hyperphosphorylated in the absence of Nrf2. Our results also show that CREB and ATF1 hyperphosphorylation can be induced through inhibition of HO-1 activity. Our findings highlight the importance of the p38 MAPK-CREB signaling axis in Nrf2-mediated regulation of DC immune function. All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. FCS (Invitrogen), SB203580 and PD98059 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and tin protoporphyrin IX dichloride (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) were also purchased for the study. Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice were purchased from Riken BioResource Center (Ibaraki, Japan) and maintained at the Biomedical Services Unit, University of Liverpool (27.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S.

Protocols described herein were undertaken in accordance with criteria outlined in license granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (PPL 40/3379). Bone marrow-derived iDCs were generated from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice according to published protocol (28.Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rössner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. An advanced culture method for generating large quantities of highly pure dendritic cells from mouse bone marrow.J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). On day 6 cells were harvested, and CD11c-positive DCs were isolated using magnetic beads by positive selection according to the manufacturer's instructions (MiltenyiBiotec, Surrey, UK). The purity of the isolated DC population was >90% as determined by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). DCs were stained with fluorescent αCD11cTC (Invitrogen) and αCD86FITC, or αMHCIIPE (BD Biosciences) antibodies for 30 min on ice, washed, acquired on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and analyzed using Cyflogic software (version 1.2.1, CyFlo, Ltd.). Basal or vitamin-treated iDCs from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice were stained using fluorescent ROS indicator, dihydroethidium, according to Ref. 29.Bindokas V.P. Jordán J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. Superoxide production in rat hippocampal neurons: selective imaging with hydroethidine.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and analyzed by flow cytometry. F5 CD8 T cell proliferation was quantified as described previously (30.Johnson K.G. LeRoy F.G. Borysiewicz L.K. Matthews R.J. TCR signaling thresholds regulating T cell development and activation are dependent upon SHP-1.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3802-3813PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− iDCs were pulsed with a dose range of antigenic peptide (NP68), washed, and co-cultured with F5 CD8 T cells for 72 h. [3H]Thymidine was added for the last 16 h. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filter mats and read on a scintillation counter (MicroBetaTrilux; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− iDCs were lysed, and 20 μg of lysate protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare), blocked, and probed for the indicated proteins using the appropriate primary antibodies; phospho-p38, p38, phospho-CREB, CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); and α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and visualized using the ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell-free culture supernatants were used for measuring IL-10 cytokine concentrations by sandwich ELISA (Quantikine, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). On day 6, DCs were seeded onto 24-well plates in duplicates at a density of 8 × 105 DCs per ml at 2 ml/well. After 48 h, cell-free supernatants from SB203580 untreated and treated groups with or without the Toll-like receptor agonist LPS were collected and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Raw data obtained were analyzed using the unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Loss of Nrf2 leads to increased co-stimulatory molecule expression, T cell stimulatory potential, and elevated ROS levels in iDCs (14.Rangasamy T. Williams M.A. Bauer S. Trush M.A. Emo J. Georas S.N.

We investigated whether the elevated ROS contributed to increased co-stimulatory molecules expression by reducing ROS to normal levels using antioxidants in these cells. Vitamins C and E have antioxidant activity and are known to reduce ROS levels (31.Jeong Y.J. Hong S.W. Kim J.H. Jin D.H. Kang J.S. Lee W.J. Hwang Y.I.

Toxicol. 2009; 25: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− iDCs were treated with vitamins C and E for 48 h, and ROS levels measured by flow cytometry using the fluorescent ROS indicator dihydroethidium. A significant reduction in ROS levels was observed in vitamin-treated Nrf2−/− iDCs compared with untreated controls (mean fluorescence intensity, 2079 versus 938, p < 0.05) as shown in Fig. 1A. A slight reduction in the ROS levels was also seen in vitamin-treated Nrf2+/+ iDCs, which was not statistically significant (mean fluorescence intensity 1230 versus 878, p > 0.05) (Fig. 1A). It is important to note that the ROS levels in vitamin-treated Nrf2−/− iDCs was equivalent to that in untreated Nrf2+/+ iDCs (Fig. 1A). To test whether elevated intracellular redox levels is responsible for increased DC co-stimulatory molecule expression, we measured MHC II and CD86 expression in Nrf2−/− iDCs following vitamins treatment. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression of MHC II and CD86 under basal condition was significantly higher in the Nrf2−/− iDCs compared with Nrf2+/+ iDCs (MHC II 43.2% versus 23.1%, p < 0.05; CD86 34.8% versus 18.4%, p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the co-stimulatory molecules expression between untreated controls and vitamins treatment groups in both Nrf2+/+ (MHC II 23.1% versus 21.2% p > 0.05; CD86 18.4% versus 17.2%, p > 0.05) and Nrf2−/− iDCs (MHC II 43.2% versus 42.6% p > 0.05; CD86 34.8% versus 35.2%, p > 0.05). This result indicates that restoring ROS levels in Nrf2−/− to Nrf2+/+ status did not reverse co-stimulatory molecule expression. We further investigated whether the lack of change in co-stimulatory molecule expression in Nrf2−/− iDCs to ROS reset is also reflected in its ability to induce antigen-specific T cell activation. To determine this, we utilized a TCR transgenic mouse model wherein the CD8 T cells express a T cell receptor (F5 TCR) that responds to an antigenic peptide, NP68, when presented by DCs (33.Mamalaki C. Norton T. Tanaka Y. Townsend A.R. Chandler P. Simpson E. Kioussis D. Thymic depletion and peripheral activation of class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells by soluble peptide in T-cell receptor transgenic mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 11342-11346Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using this system, we have previously shown that NP68-bearing Nrf2−/− iDCs stimulated F5 CD8 T cell proliferation more potently than its wild type counterpart (26.Aw Yeang H.X. Hamdam J.M. Al-Huseini L.M. Sethu S. Djouhri L. Walsh J. Kitteringham N. Park B.K. Goldring C.E. Sathish J.G.

Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10556-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings, antigenic peptide-bearing Nrf2−/− iDCs induced higher F5 CD8 T cell proliferation compared with Nrf2+/+ iDCs (Fig. 1C). Lowering of ROS levels by vitamin treatment did not reduce the potential of NP68-bearing Nrf2−/− iDCs to stimulate F5 CD8 T cell proliferation (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that altered ROS status associated with loss of Nrf2 does not contribute to increased co-stimulatory molecules expression and T cell stimulatory potential of DCs. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling comprising of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK pathways coordinate DCs co-stimulatory molecules expression and DC-mediated T cell activation (5.Arrighi J.F.

In the current study, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK and JNK in this context using synthetic inhibitors of JNK and p38 MAPK (JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125; p38 activity inhibitor, SB203580). JNK inhibition did not reverse the enhanced co-stimulatory molecules expression in Nrf2−/− iDCs to that of the wild type levels (MHC II, 42.8% versus 47.0%; p > 0.05; CD86, 44.0% versus 51.8%; p > 0.05 in Nrf2−/− iDCs; and MHC II, 21.3% versus 20.5%, p > 0.05; CD86, 20.0% versus 21.0%, p > 0.05 in Nrf2+/+ iDCs) as indicated in Fig. 2A. The iDC-mediated antigen-specific CD8 T cell proliferation also remained unaltered following JNK inhibition in Nrf2−/− and Nrf2+/+ iDCs (Fig. 2B). However, inhibition of p38 MAPK activity caused a significant reduction in co-stimulatory molecule expression in Nrf2−/− iDCs (Fig. 3A) (MHC II, 41.0% versus 32.3%, p < 0.05; CD86, 38.6% versus 27.8%, p < 0.05). Inhibition of p38 MAPK in Nrf2+/+ iDCs resulted in only a slight, statistically insignificant reduction in co-stimulatory molecules expression (MHC II, 17.2% versus 13.0%, p > 0.05; CD86, 17.2% versus 14.0%, p > 0.05). Consistent with the changes in co-stimulatory molecule expression, inhibition of p38 MAPK resulted in significant reductions in DC-mediated antigen-specific CD8 T cell proliferation in Nrf2−/− iDCs with less pronounced effects on Nrf2+/+ iDCs (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest the contribution of p38 MAPK but not JNK in the Nrf2-dependent modulation of DC immune functions.FIGURE 3Contribution of p38 MAPK activity toward altered phenotype and function of Nrf2−/− iDCs. Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− iDCs treated with or without 20 μm of p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (SB) for 48 h.

Western blotting analysis revealed marginal differences in p38 MAPK phosphorylation between Nrf2−/− and Nrf2+/+ iDCs (Fig. 4A). Major downstream effectors of p38 MAPK are the transcription factors, CREB and ATF1. Serine phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1 by upstream MAPKs is required for their activation. We measured the phosphorylation state of CREB and ATF1 and observed that CREB and ATF1 were hyperphosphorylated under basal conditions in Nrf2−/− iDCs (Fig. 4B). A significant reduction in the phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1 was observed upon inhibiting p38 MAPK activity using a pharmacological inhibitor (SB203580) as seen in Fig. 4C. This suggests that CREB and ATF1 phosphorylation in DCs are dependent on p38 MAPK activity"

Because pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) serves as a coenzyme in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, and neurotransmitters, as well as in aspects of one-carbon metabolism, vitamin B-6 deficiency could have many effects. Healthy men and women (age: 20-40 y; n = 23) were fed a 2-day controlled, nutritionally adequate diet followed by a 28-day low-vitamin B-6 diet (<0.5 mg/d) to induce marginal deficiency, as reflected by a decline of plasma PLP from 52.6±14.1 (mean ± SD) to 21.5±4.6 nmol/L (P<0.0001) and increased cystathionine from 131±65 to 199±56 nmol/L (P<0.001). Fasting plasma samples obtained before and after vitamin B6 restriction were analyzed by 1H-NMR with and without filtration and by targeted quantitative analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). Multilevel partial least squares-discriminant analysis and S-plots of NMR spectra showed that NMR is effective in classifying samples according to vitamin B-6 status and identified discriminating features. NMR spectral features of selected metabolites indicated that vitamin B-6 restriction significantly increased the ratios of glutamine/glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate/glutamate (P<0.001) and tended to increase concentrations of acetate, pyruvate, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (adjusted P<0.05). Tandem MS showed significantly greater plasma proline after vitamin B-6 restriction (adjusted P<0.05), but there were no effects on the profile of 14 other amino acids and 45 acylcarnitines. These findings demonstrate that marginal vitamin B-6 deficiency has widespread metabolic perturbations and illustrate the utility of metabolomics in evaluating complex effects of altered vitamin B-6 intake."

We use a spatially-explicit modeling tool, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), to estimate how changes in land use and land cover (LULC), including public land acquisitions for conservation, influence the joint provision and value of multiple ecosystem services. We calculate the ROI of a public conservation acquisition as the ratio of the present value of ecosystem services generated by the conservation to the cost of the conservation. For the land scenarios analyzed, carbon sequestration services generated the greatest benefits followed by water quality improvements and recreation opportunities. We found ROI values ranged from 0.21 to 5.28 depending on assumptions about future land use change, service values, and discount rate. Our study suggests conservation is a good investment as long as investments are targeted to areas with low land costs and high service values."
https://openalex.org/W2031291239,"Intermediate amyloidogenic states along the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) aggregation pathway have been shown to be linked to neurotoxicity. To shed more light on the different structures that may arise during Aβ aggregation, we here investigate surfactant-induced Aβ aggregation. This process leads to co-aggregates featuring a β-structure motif that is characteristic for mature amyloid-like structures. Surfactants induce secondary structure in Aβ in a concentration-dependent manner, from predominantly random coil at low surfactant concentration, via β-structure to the fully formed α-helical state at high surfactant concentration. The β-rich state is the most aggregation-prone as monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence. Small angle x-ray scattering reveals initial globular structures of surfactant-Aβ co-aggregated oligomers and formation of elongated fibrils during a slow aggregation process. Alongside this slow (minutes to hours time scale) fibrillation process, much faster dynamic exchange (k(ex) ∼1100 s(-1)) takes place between free and co-aggregate-bound peptide. The two hydrophobic segments of the peptide are directly involved in the chemical exchange and interact with the hydrophobic part of the co-aggregates. Our findings suggest a model for surfactant-induced aggregation where free peptide and surfactant initially co-aggregate to dynamic globular oligomers and eventually form elongated fibrils. When interacting with β-structure promoting substances, such as surfactants, Aβ is kinetically driven toward an aggregation-prone state."

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction is a crucial defense mechanism during oxidant challenges, such as hyperoxia. The role of lung endothelial HO-1during hyperoxia in vivo is not well defined. We engineered lentiviral vectors with microRNA (miRNA) sequences controlled by vascular endothelium cadherin (VE-cad) to study the specific role of lung endothelial HO-1. Wild-type (WT) murine lung endothelial cells (MLECs) or WT mice were treated with lentivirus and exposed to hyperoxia (95% oxygen). We detected HO-1 knockdown (~55%) specifically in the lung endothelium. MLECs and lungs showed approximately a 2-fold increase in apoptosis and ROS generation after HO-1 silencing. We also demonstrate for the first time that silencing endothelial HO-1 has the same effect on lung injury and survival as silencing HO-1 in multiple lung cell types and that HO-1 regulates caspase 3 activation and autophagy in endothelium during hyperoxia.

https://openalex.org/W1983263560,"The zymogen prothrombin is composed of fragment 1 containing a Gla domain and kringle-1, fragment 2 containing kringle-2, and a protease domain containing A and B chains. The prothrombinase complex assembled on the surface of platelets converts prothrombin to thrombin by cleaving at Arg-271 and Arg-320. The three-dimensional architecture of prothrombin and the molecular basis of its activation remain elusive. Here we report the first x-ray crystal structure of prothrombin as a Gla-domainless construct carrying an Ala replacement of the catalytic Ser-525. Prothrombin features a conformation 80 Å long, with fragment 1 positioned at a 36° angle relative to the main axis of fragment 2 coaxial to the protease domain. High flexibility of the linker connecting the two kringles suggests multiple arrangements for kringle-1 relative to the rest of the prothrombin molecule. Luminescence resonance energy transfer measurements detect two distinct conformations of prothrombin in solution, in a 3:2 ratio, with the distance between the two kringles either fully extended (54 ± 2 Å) or partially collapsed (≤34 Å) as seen in the crystal structure. A molecular mechanism of prothrombin activation emerges from the structure. Of the two sites of cleavage, Arg-271 is located in a disordered region connecting kringle-2 to the A chain, but Arg-320 is well defined within the activation domain and is not accessible to proteolysis in solution. Burial of Arg-320 prevents prothrombin autoactivation and directs prothrombinase to cleave at Arg-271 first. Reversal of the local electrostatic potential then redirects prothrombinase toward Arg-320, leading to thrombin generation via the prethrombin-2 intermediate."

Post-fusion, the complex is disassembled by an AAA+ ATPase called N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). We present evidence that NSF uses a processive unwinding mechanism to disassemble SNARE proteins. Using a real-time disassembly assay based on fluorescence dequenching, we correlate NSF-driven disassembly rates with the SNARE-activated ATPase activity of NSF. Neuronal SNAREs activate the ATPase rate of NSF by ∼26-fold. One SNARE complex takes an average of ∼5 s to disassemble in a process that consumes ∼50 ATP. Investigations of substrate requirements show that NSF is capable of disassembling a truncated SNARE substrate consisting of only the core SNARE domain, but not an unrelated four-stranded coiled-coil.

https://openalex.org/W1997888635,"Background Many children can be exposed to multiple adversities in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) placing them at potential risk of psychological problems. However, there is a paucity of research using large representative cohorts examining the psychological adjustment of children in school settings in these countries. Children’s psychological adjustment has been shown to affect educational progress which is critical for their future. This study, based in a rural, socio-economically disadvantaged area of South Africa, aimed to examine the prevalence of children’s psychological problems as well as possible risk and protective factors. Methods Rates of psychological problems in 10–12 year olds were examined using teacher- and child-report questionnaires. Data on children from 10 rural primary schools, selected by stratified random sampling, were linked to individual and household data from the Agincourt health and socio-demographic surveillance system collected from households over 15 years. Results A total of 1,025 children were assessed. Teachers identified high levels of behavioural and emotional problems (41%). Children reported lower, but substantial rates of anxiety/depression (14%), and significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (24%); almost a quarter felt unsafe in school. Risk factors included being a second-generation former refugee and being from a large household. Protective factors highlight the importance of maternal factors, such as being more educated and in a stable partnership. Conclusion The high levels of psychological problems identified by teachers are a serious public health concern, as they are likely to impact negatively on children’s education, particularly given the large class sizes and limited resources in rural LMIC settings. Despite the high levels of risk, a proportion of children were managing well and research to understand resilience could inform interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2160418500,"In both rodents and humans, excessive consumption of a typical Western diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol is known to result in disruption of energy metabolism and development of obesity and insulin resistance. However, how these high-fat, energy-dense diets affect bone development, morphology, and modeling is poorly understood. Here we show that male weanling rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet containing 45% fat and 0.5% cholesterol made with casein (HF-Cas) for 6 wk displayed a significant increase in bone marrow adiposity and insulin resistance. Substitution of casein with soy protein isolate (SPI) in the HF diet (HF-SPI) prevented these effects. Maintenance of bone quantity in the SPI-fed rats was associated with increased undercarboxylated osteocalcin secretion and altered JNK/IRS1/Akt insulin signaling in osteoblasts. The HF-Cas group had significantly greater serum nonesterified free fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations than controls, whereas the HF-SPI prevented this increase. In vitro treatment of osteoblasts or mesenchymal stromal ST2 cells with NEFAs significantly decreased insulin signaling. An isoflavone mixture similar to that found in serum of HF-SPI rats significantly increased in vitro osteoblast proliferation and blocked significantly reduced NEFA-induced insulin resistance. Finally, insulin/IGF1 was able to increase both osteoblast activity and differentiation in a set of in vitro studies. These results suggest that high-fat feeding may disrupt bone development and modeling; high concentrations of NEFAs and insulin resistance occurring with high fat intake are mediators of reduced osteoblast activity and differentiation; diets high in soy protein may help prevent high dietary fat-induced bone impairments; and the molecular mechanisms underlying the SPI-protective effects involve isoflavone-induced normalization of insulin signaling in bone."
https://openalex.org/W1989411035,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is central to the onset of protein synthesis and its modulation in response to physiological demands. eIF2, a heterotrimeric G-protein, is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange to deliver the initiator methionyl-tRNA to the ribosome. Here we report that assembly of the eIF2 complex in vivo depends on Cdc123, a cell proliferation protein conserved among eukaryotes. Mutations of CDC123 in budding yeast reduced the association of eIF2 subunits, diminished polysome levels, and increased GCN4 expression indicating that Cdc123 is critical for eIF2 activity. Cdc123 bound the unassembled eIF2γ subunit, but not the eIF2 complex, and the C-terminal domain III region of eIF2γ was both necessary and sufficient for Cdc123 binding. Alterations of the binding site revealed a strict correlation between Cdc123 binding, the biological function of eIF2γ, and its ability to assemble with eIF2α and eIF2β. Interestingly, high levels of Cdc123 neutralized the assembly defect and restored the biological function of an eIF2γ mutant. Moreover, the combined overexpression of eIF2 subunits rescued an otherwise inviable cdc123 deletion mutant. Thus, Cdc123 is a specific eIF2 assembly factor indispensable for the onset of protein synthesis. Human Cdc123 is encoded by a disease risk locus, and, therefore, eIF2 biogenesis control by Cdc123 may prove relevant for normal cell physiology and human health. This work identifies a novel step in the eukaryotic translation initiation pathway and assigns a biochemical function to a protein that is essential for growth and viability of eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050969897,"Glioblastoma (GB) is the highest grade of primary adult brain tumors, characterized by a poorly defined and highly invasive cell population. Importantly, these invading cells are attributed with having a decreased sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy. TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)-Fn14 ligand-receptor signaling is one mechanism in GB that promotes cell invasiveness and survival and is dependent upon the activity of multiple Rho GTPases, including Rac1. Here we report that Src homology 3 domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SGEF), a RhoG-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is overexpressed in GB tumors and promotes TWEAK-Fn14-mediated glioma invasion. Importantly, levels of SGEF expression in GB tumors inversely correlate with patient survival. SGEF mRNA expression is increased in GB cells at the invasive rim relative to those in the tumor core, and knockdown of SGEF expression by shRNA decreases glioma cell migration in vitro and invasion ex vivo. Furthermore, we showed that, upon TWEAK stimulation, SGEF is recruited to the Fn14 cytoplasmic tail via TRAF2. Mutation of the Fn14-TRAF domain site or depletion of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) expression by siRNA oligonucleotides blocked SGEF recruitment to Fn14 and inhibited SGEF activity and subsequent GB cell migration. We also showed that knockdown of either SGEF or RhoG diminished TWEAK activation of Rac1 and subsequent lamellipodia formation. Together, these results indicate that SGEF-RhoG is an important downstream regulator of TWEAK-Fn14-driven GB cell migration and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1973516258,"Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies play a fundamental role in allergic disease and are a target for therapeutic intervention. IgE functions principally through two receptors, FcεRI and CD23 (FcεRII). Minute amounts of allergen trigger mast cell or basophil degranulation by cross-linking IgE-bound FcεRI, leading to an inflammatory response. The interaction between IgE and CD23 on B-cells regulates IgE synthesis. CD23 is unique among Ig receptors in that it belongs to the C-type (calcium-dependent) lectin-like superfamily. Although the interaction of CD23 with IgE is carbohydrate-independent, calcium has been reported to increase the affinity for IgE, but the structural basis for this activity has previously been unknown. We have determined the crystal structures of the human lectin-like head domain of CD23 in its Ca(2+)-free and Ca(2+)-bound forms, as well as the crystal structure of the Ca(2+)-bound head domain of CD23 in complex with a subfragment of IgE-Fc consisting of the dimer of Cε3 and Cε4 domains (Fcε3-4). Together with site-directed mutagenesis, the crystal structures of four Ca(2+) ligand mutants, isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, and stopped-flow analysis, we demonstrate that Ca(2+) binds at the principal and evolutionarily conserved binding site in CD23. Ca(2+) binding drives Pro-250, at the base of an IgE-binding loop (loop 4), from the trans to the cis configuration with a concomitant conformational change and ordering of residues in the loop. These Ca(2+)-induced structural changes in CD23 lead to additional interactions with IgE, a more entropically favorable interaction, and a 30-fold increase in affinity of a single head domain of CD23 for IgE. Taken together, these results suggest that binding of Ca(2+) brings an extra degree of modulation to CD23 function."
https://openalex.org/W2087128374,"In vitro, ferrous deoxy-hemes in hemoglobin (Hb) react with nitrite to generate nitric oxide (NO) through a nitrite reductase reaction. In vivo studies indicate Hb with nitrite can be a source of NO bioactivity. The nitrite reductase reaction does not appear to account fully for this activity because free NO is short lived especially within the red blood cell. Thus, the exporting of NO bioactivity both out of the RBC and over a large distance requires an additional mechanism. A nitrite anhydrase (NA) reaction in which N2O3, a potent S-nitrosating agent, is produced through the reaction of NO with ferric heme-bound nitrite has been proposed (Basu, S., Grubina, R., Huang, J., Conradie, J., Huang, Z., Jeffers, A., Jiang, A., He, X., Azarov, I., Seibert, R., Mehta, A., Patel, R., King, S. B., Hogg, N., Ghosh, A., Gladwin, M. T., and Kim-Shapiro, D. B. (2007) Nat. Chem. Biol. 3, 785-794) as a possible mechanism. Legitimate concerns, including physiological relevance and the nature of the mechanism, have been raised concerning the NA reaction. This study addresses these concerns demonstrating NO and nitrite with ferric hemes under near physiological conditions yield an intermediate having the properties of the purported NA heme-bound N2O3 intermediate. The results indicate that ferric heme sites, traditionally viewed as a source of potential toxicity, can be functionally significant, especially for partially oxygenated/partially met-R state Hb that arises from the NO dioxygenation reaction. In the presence of low levels of nitrite and either NO or a suitable reductant such as L-cysteine, these ferric heme sites can function as a generator for the formation of S-nitrosothiols such as S-nitrosoglutathione and, as such, should be considered as a source of RBC-derived and exportable bioactive NO."
https://openalex.org/W2156486579,"Normally siRNA has to be chemically stabilized in therapeutic applications. It is a challenge to obtain optimal stabilizing effects while maintaining full silencing activity due to a lack of understanding of how different chemical modifications would influence the efficacy of siRNA. In the current study, the effect of single 2‘-sugar modifications was profiled across the length of the siRNA guide strand. This led to the surprising finding that a single 2‘-OMe modification at position 14 of the siRNA guide strand substantially compromised its gene-silencing activity in a manner that was independent of the nucleotide identity at this site or the sequence context around it. We found that modification at position 14 of the siRNA guide strand reduced its RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading tremendously, whereas the loading of the siRNA sense strand was only marginally affected. When comparing the silencing potency of 14th position-modified siRNA (transfected at 16.7 nM) and native control (transfected at 1 nM) at equivalent Ago2 loading levels, the silencing potency of modified siRNA was much lower, even lower than the level of native siRNA transfected at 0.1 nM. These data indicated that modification at position 14 of the siRNA guide strand abolishes its gene-silencing activity by decreasing both RISC loading and target degradation. Using a computational modeling approach, we demonstrated an intimate interaction between the 14th nucleotide of guide strand and the amino acid Q675 in the AGO protein, which is located in a highly conserved loop of PIWI domain. In addition to gaining insights into siRNA-AGO interactions, this study of structure-activity relationship further established a general principle for siRNA modification in siRNA drug development.— Zheng, J., Zhang, L., Zhang, J., Wang, X., Ye, K., Xi, Z., Du, Q., Liang, Z., Single modification at position 14 of siRNA strand abolishes its gene-silencing activity by decreasing both RISC loading and target degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2023674030,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition is one of the critical cellular programs that facilitate the progression of breast cancer to an invasive disease. We have observed that the expression of N-myc interactor (NMI) decreases significantly during progression of breast cancer, specifically in invasive and metastatic stages. Recapitulation of this loss in breast cell lines with epithelial morphology (MCF10A (non-tumorigenic) and T47D (tumorigenic)) by silencing NMI expression causes mesenchymal-like morphological changes in 3D growth, accompanied by upregulation of SLUG and ZEB2 and increased invasive properties. Conversely, we found that restoring NMI expression attenuated the mesenchymal attributes of metastatic breast cancer cells, accompanied by distinctly circumscribed 3D growth with basement membrane deposition and decreased invasion. Further investigations into the downstream signaling modulated by NMI revealed that NMI expression negatively regulates SMAD signaling, which is a key regulator of cellular plasticity. We demonstrate that NMI blocks TGF-β/SMAD signaling via upregulation of SMAD7, a negative feedback regulator of the pathway. We also provide evidence that NMI activates STAT signaling, which negatively modulates TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of NMI during breast cancer progression could be one of the driving factors that enhance the invasive ability of breast cancer by aberrant activation of TGF-β/SMAD signaling."

Present data link estrogen:ERα-driven transcription with cell cycle progression. Although liganded ERα induces many genes within 1–4 h, gene activation after 6 h is thought to be indirect. Here, we identify SKP2 as a late-acting coactivator that drives ERα targets to promote G1-to-S progression. Data support a model in which estrogen-activated cyclin E-CDK2 binds and phosphorylates ERαS341, to prime ERα-SCFSKP2 binding via SKP2-L248QTLL252 in late G1. SKP2 activates ERα ubiquitylation and proteolysis. Putative late ERα targets were identified by expression profiling. SKP2 knockdown attenuated E2F-1 and BLM induction. SKP2 overexpression, but not coactivator motif mutant SKP2-L248QTAA252, enhanced estrogen-induced E2F-1 and BLM expression. SKP2 knockdown impaired estrogen-stimulated ERα, SKP2, SRC3 and RNA polymerase II recruitment to E2F-1 and BLM promoters. This work not only identifies these late-activated genes as bona fide ERα targets but describes a novel mechanism for their periodic activation. SKP2 serves as dual ERα E3 ligase/coactivator for late-activated target genes, revealing a novel mechanism whereby ERα/SCFSKP2 transactivation of E2F-1 feeds forward to drive G1-to-S."
https://openalex.org/W2079163873,"SMC1 and SMC3 form a high-affinity heterodimer, which provides an open backbone of the cohesin ring, to be closed by a kleisin protein. RNAi mediated knock-down of either one heterodimer partner, SMC1 or SMC3, is expected to cause very similar if not identical phenotypes. However, we observed highly distinct, protein-specific phenotypes. Upon knock-down of human SMC1, much of SMC3 remains stable, accumulates in the cytoplasm and does not associate with other cohesin proteins. Most of the excess nuclear SMC3 is highly mobile and not or only weakly chromosome-associated. In contrast, human SMC3 knock-down rendered SMC1 instable without cytoplasmic accumulation. As observed by differential protein extraction and in FRAP experiments the remaining SMC1 or SMC3 proteins in the respective SMC1 or SMC3 knock-down experiments constituted a cohesin pool, which is associated with chromatin with highest affinity, likely the least expendable. Expression of bovine EGFP-SMC1 or mouse EGFP-SMC3 in human cells under conditions of human SMC1 or SMC3 knock-down rescued the respective phenotypes, but in untreated cells over-expressed exogenous SMC proteins mis-localized. Paucity of either one of the SMC proteins causes RAD21 degradation. These results argue for great caution in interpreting SMC1 and SMC3 RNAi or over-expression experiments. Under challenged conditions these two proteins unexpectedly behave differently, which may have biological consequences for regulation of cohesin-associated functions and for human cohesin pathologies."

Live cell imaging using a GFP biosensor revealed rapid PTEN-dependent depression of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels in the growth cone induced by the repellent myelin-associated glycoprotein. Moreover, down-regulating PTEN expression blocked negative remodeling of β1-integrin adhesions triggered by myelin-associated glycoprotein, yet permitted integrin clustering by a positive chemotropic treatment. Thus, PTEN negatively regulates growth cone phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels and mediates chemorepulsion, whereas chemoattraction is PTEN-independent. Regenerative therapies targeting PTEN may therefore suppress growth cone repulsion to soluble cues while permitting attractive guidance, an essential feature for re-forming functional neural circuits.Background: The phosphatase PTEN is implicated in suppressing neuroregeneration following injury.Results: Chemorepulsion of axons by distinct cues, but not chemoattraction, correlates with PTEN activity, depression of phosphatidylinositol signaling, and remodeling of integrin adhesions.Conclusion: PTEN mediates chemorepulsion selectively.Significance: Suppressing PTEN activity may block repulsion by negative cues after injury while permitting attractive guidance of regenerating axons. Negatively targeting the tumor suppressor and phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) promotes axon regrowth after injury. How PTEN functions in axon guidance has remained unknown. Here we report the differential role of PTEN in chemotactic guidance of axonal growth cones.

https://openalex.org/W1970998802,"In cells of the innate immune system, pathological increases in intracellular cAMP attenuate immune responses and contribute to infections by bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis. In this work, cAMP from B. anthracis edema toxin (ET) is found to activate the Notch signaling pathway in both mouse macrophages and human monocytes. ET as well as a cell-permeable activator of PKA induce Notch target genes (HES1, HEY1, IL2RA, and IL7R) and are able to significantly enhance the induction of these Notch target genes by a Toll-like receptor ligand. Elevated cAMP also resulted in increased levels of Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of Split (TLE) and led to increased amounts of a transcriptional repressor complex consisting of TLE and the Notch target Hes1. To address the mechanism used by ET to activate Notch signaling, components of Notch signaling were examined, and results revealed that ET increased levels of recombinant recognition sequence binding protein at the Jκ site (RBP-J), a DNA binding protein and principal transcriptional regulator of Notch signaling. Overexpression studies indicated that RBP-J was sufficient to activate Notch signaling and potentiate LPS-induced Notch signaling. Further examination of the mechanism used by ET to activate Notch signaling revealed that C/EBP β, a transcription factor activated by cAMP, helped activate Notch signaling and up-regulated RBP-J. These studies demonstrate that cAMP activates Notch signaling and increases the expression of TLE, which could be an important mechanism utilized by cAMP to suppress immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2016895522,"Duck viral enteritis (DVE) is an acute, contagious herpesvirus infection of ducks, geese, and swans of all ages and species. This disease has been responsible for significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin in specific plants and exhibits inhibitory activity against many kinds of virus. In this paper, resveratrol was found to inhibit duck enteritis virus (DEV) replication in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition concentration of 3.85 μg/mL. The inhibition in virus multiplication in the presence of resveratrol was not attributed to direct inactivation or inhibition of virus attachment to the host cells, but to the inhibition of viral multiplication in host cells. The assay of the time of addition limited the drug effect during the first 8 h of infection. This conclusion was supported by the ultrastructure images of the early stage of DEV infection, which showed that the replication of virus nucleic acid and the formation of the capsid in the cell nucleus were suppressed. In the indirect immunofluorescence assay, proteins expression in DEV infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) within 24 h post-infection (p.i.) was also effectively suppressed by resveratrol. In summary, the resveratrol has a good activity against DEV infection in vitro, which could be attributed to that fact that several essential immediate early viral proteins for virus replication were impacted by resveratrol."

Here, we describe the biochemical characterization of Hpa2 and Hpa3 as bona fide acetyltransferases with different substrate specificities. Mutational and MALDI-TOF analyses showed that Hpa3 translation initiates primarily from Met-19 rather than the annotated start site, Met-1, with a minor product starting at Met-27. When expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed in vitro, Hpa2 and Hpa3 (from Met-19) acetylated histones and polyamines.

https://openalex.org/W1992781212,"Previous studies suggested Ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene (ATDC) as an oncogene in many types of cancer. However, its expression and biological functions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. Herein, we investigated its expression pattern in 109 cases of human NSCLC samples by immunohistochemistry and found that ATDC was overexpressed in 62 of 109 NSCLC samples (56.88%). ATDC overexpression correlated with histological type (p<0.0001), tumor status (p = 0.0227) and histological differentiation (p = 0.0002). Next, we overexpressed ATDC in normal human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE and depleted its expression in NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299. MTT and colony formation assay showed that ATDC overexpression promoted cell proliferation while its depletion inhibited cell growth. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis showed that ATDC overexpression decreased the percentage of cells in G1 phase and increased the percentage of cells in S phase, while ATDC siRNA treatment increased the G1 phase percentage and decreased the S phase percentage. Further study revealed that ATDC overexpression could up-regulate cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression in HBE cells while its depletion down-regulated cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression in A549 and H1299 cells. In addition, ATDC overexpression was also associated with an increased proliferation index, cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression in human NSCLC samples. Further experiments demonstrated that ATDC up-regulated cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression independent of wnt/β-catenin or p53 signaling pathway. Interestingly, ATDC overexpression increased NF-κB reporter luciferase activity and p-IκB protein level. Correspondingly, NF-κB inhibitor blocked the effect of ATDC on up-regulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ATDC could promote lung cancer proliferation through NF-κB induced up-regulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc."
https://openalex.org/W2075487997,"The transcription factor MafA is a key regulator of insulin gene expression and maturation of islet β cells. Despite its importance, the regulatory mechanism of MafA gene expression is still unclear. To identify the transcriptional regulators of MafA, we examined various transcription factors, which are potentially involved in β cell differentiation. An adenovirus-mediated overexpression study clearly demonstrated that Onecut1 suppresses the promoter activity of MafA through the Foxa2-binding cis-element on the MafA enhancer region (named area A). However, ChIP analysis showed that Foxa2 but not Onecut1 could directly bind to area A. Furthermore, overexpression of Onecut1 inhibited the binding of Foxa2 onto area A upon ChIP analysis. Importantly, insertion of a mutation in the Foxa2-binding site of area A significantly decreased the promoter activity of MafA. These findings suggest that Onecut1 suppresses MafA gene expression through the Foxa2-binding site. In the mouse pancreas, MafA expression was first detected at the latest stage of β cell differentiation and was scarcely observed in Onecut1-positive cells during pancreas development. In addition, Onecut1 expression was significantly increased in the islets of diabetic db/db mice, whereas MafA expression was markedly decreased. The improved glucose levels of db/db mice with insulin injections significantly reduced Onecut1 expression and rescued the reduction of MafA expression. These in vivo experiments also suggest that Onecut1 is a negative regulator of MafA gene expression. This study implicates the novel role of Onecut1 in the control of normal β cell differentiation and its involvement in β cell dysfunction under diabetic conditions by suppressing MafA gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1964793603,"Background The efficacy of antihypertensive (AH) treatment after stroke has been investigated in several randomized clinical trials. However, non-adherence to AH medication is common for stroke patients in “real world” setting. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of persistence with AH agents on ischemic stroke (IS) outcomes. Methods and Results Using the China National Stroke Registry, we analyzed data from 8409 IS patients with hypertension. Persistence with AH therapy (high persistence ≥75%, low persistence <75%) was measured by patient self-report at 3, 6, and 12 months after stroke. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between persistence and IS outcomes (stroke recurrence, combined vascular events and death) at 12 months. Of the 8409 patients in this study, 40.0% were female and the mean age at study entry was 66.7 years. 31.6% of patients had high persistence with AH drugs, and 68.4% had low persistence during 1 year after stroke onset. High persistence with AH drugs significantly decreased the risk of stroke recurrence (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.89), combined vascular events (0.71; 0.63–0.81) and death (0.44; 0.36–0.53) compared with low persistence. Conclusions Our study reinforces the benefits of AH medications in routine clinical practice and highlights the importance of persistence with AH therapy among IS patients known to be hypertensive within the first year of an event."
https://openalex.org/W2081613891,"Background Legume-rhizobium symbiosis is a complex process that is regulated in the host plant cell through gene expression network. Many nodulin genes that are upregulated during different stages of nodulation have been identified in leguminous herbs. However, no nodulin genes in woody legume trees, such as black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), have yet been reported. Methodology/Principal findings To identify the nodulin genes involved in R. pseudoacacia-Mesorhizobium amorphae CCNWGS0123 symbiosis, a suppressive subtractive hybridization approach was applied to reveal profiling of differentially expressed genes and two subtracted cDNA libraries each containing 600 clones were constructed. Then, 114 unigenes were identified from forward SSH library by differential screening and the putative functions of these translational products were classified into 13 categories. With a particular interest in regulatory genes, twenty-one upregulated genes encoding potential regulatory proteins were selected based on the result of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. They included nine putative transcription genes, eight putative post-translational regulator genes and four membrane protein genes. The expression patterns of these genes were further analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR at different stages of nodule development. Conclusions The data presented here offer the first insights into the molecular foundation underlying R. pseudoacacia–M. amorphae symbiosis. A number of regulatory genes screened in the present study revealed a high level of regulatory complexity (transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational) that is likely essential to develop symbiosis. In addition, the possible roles of these genes in black locust nodulation are discussed."

The dat-1;lgc-55 double KOs were created by crossing the lgc-55(n4331)V with the BY326 strain. The BY326 animals are dat-1 KOs expressing the GFP transcriptional fusion (Pdat-1::GFP), and were kindly donated by Dr. R. Blakely from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Double deletion of the dat-1;lgc-55 mutants was verified by single and multiple worm PCR. Both SWIP and head immobilization assays were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C).

Experiments including tyramine (Sigma) were performed by including 500 μm of ascorbic acid to prevent tyramine oxidation. The same concentration of ascorbic acid was included in the relative controls. Paralyzed animals were counted every minute using an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The number of paralyzed animals was reported as a percentage of the total number of animals observed in each test ± S.E.

No other mutant tested showed basal SWIP. At least 100 animals were tested per group in at least 5 independent trials. Head immobilization assessments were performed on young adults (24 h post-larva 4). Individual animals were transferred into a 60 × 15 mm agar plate supplemented with each drug and 2 mm of glacial acetic acid or 2 mm glacial acetic acid alone. Drug containing plates were prepared by autoclaving 1.7% agar in water, cooling to about 55 °C and adding glacial acetic acid and 30 mm of tyramine or Amph. Animals were observed under a Zeiss stereoscope and scored each minute for 10 min as previous reports showed that lgc-55-mediated head immobilization reached saturation within 5 min (23.Pirri J.K.

Complementary RNAs (cRNA) were synthesized using T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). cRNA was then purified and run on denaturating agarose gels for size and integrity verification. cRNA quantification was performed spectroscopically. Stage V-VI oocytes were selected among multi-staged oocytes dissected by 2-hour collagenase (Sigma) treatment (2 mg/ml in Ca2+-free OR2 solution) from Xenopus laevis ovaries. Oocytes were injected with 50 ng/oocyte of cRNA and incubated in OR2 medium, which consists of 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter polyvinyl pyrolidone, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 2 mm Na-pyruvate at 20 °C for 2–3 days before recordings.

Electrodes (0.2–0.5 MΩ) were filled with 3 m KCl, and oocytes were perfused with a solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.2. For current-voltage relationship (I-V) analyses, 500 ms long voltage steps in 20 mV increments were applied from −160 to 100 mV. The holding potential was −30 mV. Reversal potentials were calculated by determining the x intercept of the linear regression line of each I-V curve. In dose-response experiments, currents were normalized to the mean maximum current measured for each drug. Ion selectivity was determined by substituting 96 mm NaCl with 96 mm Na-gluconate or NMDG-Cl. We used the pCLAMP10.3 suite of programs (Axon Instruments) and Origin 8.5 for data acquisition and analysis. Data were acquired and filtered at 1 and 0.2 kHz. Data were collected from 106 oocytes isolated from 4 different frogs. Amph I-V data plots were subtracted by basal currents (no Amph). Previously, we reported that Amph-induced DA release through the DAT inhibits C. elegans swimming (21.Carvelli L. Matthies D.S. Galli A. Molecular mechanisms of amphetamine actions in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We named this behavior swimming-induced paralysis (SWIP) (22.McDonald P.W. Hardie S.L. Jessen T.N. Carvelli L. Matthies D.S. Blakely R.D. Vigorous motor activity in Caenorhabditis elegans requires efficient clearance of dopamine mediated by synaptic localization of the dopamine transporter DAT-1.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14216-14227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). WT animals treated for 4 min with 0.1 mm Amph exhibited SWIP, whereas DAT KO animals (dat-1) showed a basal level of SWIP, which could not be further enhanced by exposure to 0.1 mm Amph (21.Carvelli L. Matthies D.S. Galli A. Molecular mechanisms of amphetamine actions in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the SWIP phenotype using higher (0.3–1 mm) but still physiologically relevant concentrations of Amph (24.Tallóczy Z. Martinez J. Joset D. Ray Y. Gácser A. Toussi S. Mizushima N. Nosanchuk J.D. Goldstein H. Loike J. Sulzer D. Santambrogio L. Methamphetamine inhibits antigen processing, presentation and phagocytosis.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e28Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) for longer treatment periods (10 min). As seen at lower Amph concentrations (21.Carvelli L. Matthies D.S. Galli A. Molecular mechanisms of amphetamine actions in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), high concentrations of Amph increased SWIP as a function of exposure time (filled symbols in Fig. 1A). Specifically, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 mm Amph generated 36, 72 and 92% SWIP, respectively after 10 min treatment. All Amph concentrations tested were statistically different with respect to control-treated animals (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA; n = 456). Interestingly, significant increases in SWIP were also seen in dat-1 KO animals treated with 0.5 and 1 mm Amph (● and ■ in Fig. 1B). These effects were more pronounced after extensive periods of treatment. For instance, 0, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 mm Amph generated 40, 52, 61, and 78% SWIP, respectively after 10 min treatment. Therefore, 0.5 (●) and 1 mm (■) Amph caused a significant increase in SWIP (21 ± 2% and 38 ± 1%, respectively) over dat-1 KO animals treated with vehicle (□; p ≤ 0.001, two-way ANOVA Bonferroni post-test; n = 503). These results reveal that Amph acts on targets other than the DAT to generate SWIP in the dat-1 KO genetic background. Previously, in vitro studies showed that Amph activates the trace amine-associated receptors (19.Bunzow J.R. Sonders M.S. Arttamangkul S. Harrison L.M. Zhang G. Quigley D.I. Darland T. Suchland K.L. Pasumamula S. Kennedy J.L. Olson S.B. Magenis R.E. Amara S.G. Grandy D.K. Amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, lysergic Acid diethylamide, and metabolites of the catecholamine neurotransmitters are agonists of a rat trace amine receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To test whether these receptors were recruited by Amph in our behavioral paradigm, we measured SWIP in animals lacking expression of ser-2, ser-3, or tyra-3, which encode homologues of octopamine and tyramine/octopamine and tyramine receptors, respectively (25.Chase D.L. Koelle M.R. Biogenic amine neurotransmitters in C. elegans.WormBook. 2007; : 1-15PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Tsalik E.L. Niacaris T. Wenick A.S. Pau K. Avery L. Hobert O. LIM homeobox gene-dependent expression of biogenic amine receptors in restricted regions of the C. elegans nervous system.Dev. Biol. 2003; 263: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After 10 min, Amph-induced SWIP measured in ser-3, ser-2, and tyra-3 KOs (Fig. 1C, white bars) were not statistically different than those measured in WT animals (Fig. 1C, gray bar), suggesting that these trace amine receptors are not recruited by Amph to cause SWIP. In C. elegans, serotonin signaling inhibits locomotion on solid plates (27.Sawin E.R. Ranganathan R. Horvitz H.R. C. elegans locomotory rate is modulated by the environment through a dopaminergic pathway and by experience through a serotonergic pathway.Neuron. 2000; 26: 619-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the metabotropic SER-4 and ionotropic MOD-1 serotonin receptors were involved in Amph-induced SWIP. As shown in Fig. 1C, Amph-induced SWIP was not affected by lack of expression of SER-4 or MOD-1 (oblique line bars). In fact, Amph-induced SWIP measured in SER-4 and MOD-1 KO animals (ser-4 and mod-1) were not statistically different than those measured in WT animals. These data demonstrate that these serotonin receptors are not involved in Amph-induced SWIP. Recently, the two novel amine-activated receptors, LGC-53 and LGC-55 have been identified in C. elegans (23.Pirri J.K. McPherson A.D. Donnelly J.L. Francis M.M. Alkema M.J. A tyramine-gated chloride channel coordinates distinct motor programs of a Caenorhabditis elegans escape response.Neuron. 2009; 62: 526-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28.Ringstad N. Abe N. Horvitz H.R. Ligand-gated chloride channels are receptors for biogenic amines in C. elegans.Science. 2009; 325: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These receptors function as ligand-gated ion channels activated by DA (Km = 4.4 μm) and tyramine (Km = 6 μm), respectively. Since the molecular structures of tyramine, DA, and Amph are similar we tested whether Amph-induced SWIP was dependent on LGC-53 and/or LGC-55. As shown in Fig. 1C (vertical line bar), lgc-53 KO (lgc-53) animals showed a 30% reduction in SWIP with respect to WT animals after 10 min of Amph treatment (*, p ≤ 0.05; n = 100). Interestingly, when animals lacking the LGC-55 channels (lgc-55) were tested a stronger (54%) and more significant reduction (***, p ≤ 0.0001, n = 114) in SWIP with respect to WT animals was observed (horizontal bar, Fig. 1C). A further investigation of the lgc-55 KO animals showed that after 2 to 10 min treatment with all Amph concentrations tested (0.3–1 mm), SWIP was significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.0001, two-way ANOVA Bonferroni post-test; n = 425) with respect to WT animals (compare Figs. 2A and 1A). For example, 17 ± 3% and 33 ± 2% lgc-55 KO animals exhibited SWIP after 5 and 10 min of 0.5 mm Amph treatment, whereas at the same time points, WT animals showed 37 ± 3% and 72 ± 4% SWIP, respectively (compare Figs. 2A and 1A). On the other hand, the lgc-53 KOs (●) did not show any difference in Amph-induced SWIP with respect to WT animals (□) after 5 min, 34 ± 5% and 37 ± 3%, respectively (inset, Fig. 2A). Only after 10 min of 0.5 mm Amph treatment the lgc-53 KOs showed a significant 30% reduction in SWIP with respect to WT, 45 ± 3% and 72 ± 4%, respectively (inset Fig. 2A). Because the LGC-55 played a more prominent role in Amph-induced SWIP we focused our studies on the LGC-55 channels. Our results suggest that Amph-induced SWIP mainly depends on the DAT (Fig. 1B) and the LGC-55 channel (Fig. 2A). If the DAT and the LGC-55 are independent and parallel targets of Amph, then the effect of each of these targets should be additive. Thus animals lacking both the DAT and the LGC-55 channels should not respond to Amph. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated dat-1;lgc-55 double KO animals and tested them for SWIP behavior. When treated with vehicle for 10 min, the dat-1;lgc-55 double KOs exhibited higher basal SWIP with respect to dat-1 KO animals, 63 ± 5% (n = 102) and 40 ± 2% (n = 137), respectively (compare □ in Figs. 2B and 1B), even though the lgc-55 KO animals did not show basal SWIP. Currently, we do not know the mechanism underling the increase of SWIP in the dat-1;lgc-55 double KOs. Notably though, when treated with 0.5 and 1 mm Amph the dat-1;lgc-55 double KOs did not exhibit further SWIP (● and ■ Fig. 2B). Thus, as summarized in Fig. 2C, the ΔSWIP measured after 10 min of Amph treatments in the lgc-55 (33 ± 5%, n = 100), dat-1 (20 ± 1%, n = 137), or dat-1;lgc-55 (−15 ± 20%, n = 100) KOs were substantially lower than those measured in WT animals (72 ± 12%, *, p ≤ 0.0001; n = 156). Additionally, the ΔSWIP in the dat-1;lgc-55 double KOs was further reduced as compared with the ΔSWIP measured in each single KO (# and & p ≤ 0.0001). Based on these results, we conclude that Amph engages both the DAT and the amine-gated channels, LGC-55 to cause SWIP in C. elegans. The main endogenous ligand of the LGC-55 is tyramine (23.Pirri J.K. McPherson A.D. Donnelly J.L. Francis M.M. Alkema M.J. A tyramine-gated chloride channel coordinates distinct motor programs of a Caenorhabditis elegans escape response.Neuron. 2009; 62: 526-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28.Ringstad N. Abe N. Horvitz H.R. Ligand-gated chloride channels are receptors for biogenic amines in C. elegans.Science. 2009; 325: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested animals for SWIP behavior upon treatment with exogenous tyramine. Similarly to Amph, tyramine-induced SWIP increased in a dose-dependent manner (black bars, Fig. 2D). However, after 10 min of 0.3, 0.5, and 1 mm tyramine treatment only 5 ± 6%, 20 ± 6%, and 43 ± 9% animals (n = 300) were paralyzed respectively, in contrast to Amph (n = 356) where 10 min treatment resulted in a significant increase in SWIP (36 ± 7%, 72 ± 4%, and 92 ± 3%, respectively). This result demonstrates that tyramine is less potent than Amph in generating SWIP likely because tyramine engages only the LGC-55 whereas Amph engages both the LGC-55 and DAT. Another possible explanation is that since tyramine is more charged than Amph it may simply permeate the worm cuticle less efficiently than Amph, and thus exhibits reduced apparent potency. Our data suggest that the effect of Amph on swimming behavior is partly mediated by the LGC-55 channels. One possibility is that Amph directly activates these channels. To test this hypothesis, we performed two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) experiments in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the LGC-55. In lgc-55 injected oocytes, Amph perfusion evoked reproducible currents when the oocyte membrane potential was stepped from a holding membrane potential of −30 mV to various test potentials between −160 to 100 mV (Fig. 3, A–C). No current was observed in mock injected oocytes (n = 7). When the membrane potential was clamped at −60 mV, concentration of Amph ranging from 0.05 to 1 mm generated inward currents that reached saturation at 0.5 mm Amph (Fig. 3, D and E). Cocaine, a psychostimulant and blocker of the DAT, failed to elicit any response (n = 5) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the LGC-55 channels are specifically activated by phenylethylamine compounds. At −60 mV, the dose-response curve of Amph-induced currents was well fitted by a Michael-Menten equation with a Km of 152 ± 29 μm (Fig. 3E). This value was higher than the Km = 4.1 ± 1 we calculated for tyramine-induced currents (Fig. 4A; (23.Pirri J.K. McPherson A.D. Donnelly J.L. Francis M.M. Alkema M.J.

Abe N. Horvitz H.R. Ligand-gated chloride channels are receptors for biogenic amines in C. elegans.Science. 2009; 325: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). Moreover, saturating concentrations (250 μm) of tyramine and Amph generated statistically different currents (**, p ≤ 0.001; t test, n = 6) of 3 ± 0.5 and 0.4 ± 0.09 μA, respectively (Fig. 4B). Thus, these data demonstrate that Amph activates the LGC-55 channels with lower affinity and generates smaller currents than tyramine.FIGURE 4Amph activates smaller LGC-55 currents than tyramine.

https://openalex.org/W1972947050,"Intrusive thoughts and attempts to suppress them are common, but while suppression may be effective in the short-term, it can increase thought recurrence in the long-term. Because intentional suppression involves controlled processing, and many aspects of controlled processing decline with age, age differences in thought suppression outcomes may emerge, especially over repeated thought suppression attempts as cognitive resources are expended. Using multilevel modeling, we examined age differences in reactions to thought suppression attempts across four thought suppression sequences in 40 older and 42 younger adults. As expected, age differences were more prevalent during suppression than during free monitoring periods, with younger adults indicating longer, more frequent thought recurrences and greater suppression difficulty. Further, younger adults' thought suppression outcomes changed over time, while trajectories for older adults' were relatively stable. Results are discussed in terms of older adults' reduced thought recurrence, which was potentially afforded by age-related changes in reactive control and distractibility."
https://openalex.org/W1992760825,"Purpose The causal genes for congenital cataract are good candidates for the genetic susceptibility for age-related cataract (ARC). The aim of this study was to investigate association between the polymorphisms in the causal genes for congenital cataract and ARC in a Chinese population. Meanwhile, we performed the replication study for previous identified risk genes for ARC. Methods We recruited 212 sporadic Han Chinese patients with age-related cataracts (ARC) and 172 normal controls in this study. We analyzed 31 SNPs from 13 genes which mostly possible contributes the progress of ARC in a Chinese population, comprising 212 cataract patients and 172 controls. Polymorphism-spanning fragments were amplified by using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyped using primer extension method in MassARRAY platform. Allelic and haplotypic difference in the frequencies were estimated using the SHEsis software platform. P-value was adjusted by the Bonferroni correction. Results There was no difference in the frequencies of the genotype and allele of the all SNPs between the patients with ARC and the controls. In the haplotypic analysis, the haplotypes consisting of rs7154572, rs7150141 and rs12432994 in Kinesin Light Chain 1 Gene (KLC1) showed significant association with ARC (p = 0.000878). A rare haplotype CGT was more frequent in patients (p = 0.000106, and p = 0.00795 after corrected for 75 tests). Conclusions Our study provides evidence that the combined effect of three variants within the KLC1 gene may predispose to ARC, but the precise mechanism needs further investigating."
https://openalex.org/W1982312784,"Remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils can be performed both in situ and ex situ using chemical oxidants such as sodium persulfate. Standard methods for quantifying persulfate require either centrifugation or prolonged settling times. An optimized soil extraction procedure was developed for persulfate involving simple water extraction using a modified disposable syringe. This allows considerable saving of time and removes the need for centrifugation. The extraction time was reduced to only 5 min compared to 15 min for the standard approach. A comparison of the two approaches demonstrated that each provides comparable results. Comparisons were made using high (93 g kg−1 soil) and low (9.3 g kg−1 soil) additions of sodium persulfate to a petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, as well as sand spiked with diesel. Recoveries of 95±1% and 96±10% were observed with the higher application rate in the contaminated soil and spiked sand, respectively. Corresponding recoveries of 86±5% and 117±19% were measured for the lower application rate. Results were obtained in only 25 min and the method is well suited to batch analyses. In addition, it is suitable for application in a small field laboratory or even a mobile, vehicle-based system, as it requires minimal equipment and reagents."
