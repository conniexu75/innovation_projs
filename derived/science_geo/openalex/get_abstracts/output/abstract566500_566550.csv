Postnatal ablation of insulin receptors (IRs) in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells affects hypothalamic astrocyte morphology, mitochondrial function, and circuit connectivity. Accordingly, astrocytic IR ablation reduces glucose-induced activation of hypothalamic pro-opio-melanocortin (POMC) neurons and impairs physiological responses to changes in glucose availability. Hypothalamus-specific knockout of astrocytic IRs, as well as postnatal ablation by targeting glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST)-expressing cells, replicates such alterations. A normal response to altering directly CNS glucose levels in mice lacking astrocytic IRs indicates a role in glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This was confirmed in vivo in GFAP-IR KO mice by using positron emission tomography and glucose monitoring in cerebral spinal fluid. We conclude that insulin signaling in hypothalamic astrocytes co-controls CNS glucose sensing and systemic glucose metabolism via regulation of glucose uptake across the BBB.

We conclude that insulin signaling in hypothalamic astrocytes co-controls CNS glucose sensing and systemic glucose metabolism via regulation of glucose uptake across the BBB. Glucose availability in the CNS is critical for neuronal function, and glucose levels in the brain regulate local neuronal activity and whole-body energy metabolism. Although glucose handling in the brain has been considered an insulin-independent process (Cranston et al., 1998Cranston I. Marsden P. Matyka K. Evans M. Lomas J. Sonksen P. Maisey M. Amiel S.A.

Several lines of evidence suggest that insulin signaling regulates central and systemic metabolic homeostasis (Brüning et al., 2000Brüning J.C. Gautam D. Burks D.J. Gillette J. Schubert M. Orban P.C.

However, the molecular mechanisms and the main cellular targets mediating central actions of insulin are far from being completely understood. Interestingly, alterations in the insulin-CNS axis have been associated with the progression of some neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (Kleinridders et al., 2014Kleinridders A.

Invest. 2008; 118: 2132-2147PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that an inappropriate control of central insulin signaling might be relevant for pathological conditions affecting neuronal integrity and function. Insulin receptors (IRs) are widely distributed in the CNS (Havrankova et al., 1978Havrankova J. Roth J. Brownstein M. Insulin receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system of the rat.Nature. 1978; 272: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) and abundantly expressed in epithelial cells in the choroid plexus and in brain endothelial cells (Frank et al., 1986Frank H.J. Pardridge W.M. Morris W.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Choi T.B. Binding and internalization of insulin and insulin-like growth factors by isolated brain microvessels.Diabetes. 1986; 35: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cerebral blood vessels are ensheathed by endothelial cells that interact with adjacent astrocytes, the combination regulating the entry of nutrients, such as glucose, by changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability (Alvarez et al., 2013Alvarez J.I. Katayama T. Prat A. Glial influence on the blood brain barrier.Glia. 2013; 61: 1939-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Importantly, regulation of blood glucose supply to and within the brain is controlled via glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 (Abbott et al., 2006Abbott N.J. Rönnbäck L. Hansson E.

Although GLUT-1 is highly expressed along the BBB in both endothelial cells and astrocytes (Barros et al., 2007Barros L.F. Bittner C.X. Loaiza A. Porras O.H.

Koehler-Stec E.M. Vannucci S.J. Smith Q.R. Blood-brain barrier glucose transporter: effects of hypo- and hyperglycemia revisited.J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the brain, and they provide a nurturing environment regulating all aspects of neuronal function, including synaptic plasticity, survival, development, metabolism, and neurotransmission, among others. In fact, astrocytes are able to respond to local levels of nutrients, acting as metabolic sensors and expressing specific receptors and transporters extending throughout their membrane surface (García-Cáceres et al., 2012García-Cáceres C. Fuente-Martín E. Argente J. Chowen J.A. Emerging role of glial cells in the control of body weight.Mol. Metab. 2012; 1: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, astrocytes are located at the interface between vessels and neurons, putting them in a privileged position to control glucose fluxes between the periphery and the CNS. However, the possibility that insulin signaling in astrocytes plays a functional role in systemic metabolism has never been studied. We therefore used a series of glia-specific loss-of-function models to uncover the function of astrocytic insulin signaling in the brain and, more specifically, for hypothalamic glucose sensing. To uncover the role of IRs in astrocytes, we used a Cre/lox approach to genetically remove IRs exclusively from human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP)- and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST)-positive cells. Because glial cells act as neuronal progenitor cells during brain development (Goldman, 2003Goldman S.

Using Rosa26 ACTB-tdTomato/EGFP (tdTomato/eGFP) reporter mice, we confirmed that Cre-mediated recombination occurred following intraperitoneal (i.p.) tamoxifen (Tx) injection (Figure S1A). In agreement with previous studies demonstrating that both hGFAPCreERT2 (Kim et al., 2014Kim J.G. Suyama S. Koch M. Jin S. Argente-Arizon P. Argente J. Liu Z.W. Zimmer M.R. Jeong J.K.

Inducible gene deletion in astroglia and radial glia--a valuable tool for functional and lineage analysis.Glia. 2006; 54: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) mouse models are suitable to achieve Cre-mediated recombination in astrocytes, we observed that virtually all of the Cre-recombined cells in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) exhibited the stellated morphology characteristic of astrocytes, as well as immunoreactivity for GFAP and S100β after Tx administration (Figure S1B; Table 1). To demonstrate IR deletion in cells undergoing Cre-recombination, we crossed hGFAP-CreERT2:IRf/f and IRf/f mice with hGFAP-eGFP mice in which the fluorescent protein GFP was placed under control of the human GFAP promoter (Nolte et al., 2001Nolte C.

Using this reporter mouse model, we purified hGFAP-GFP+ cells from brains of adult mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confirmed that IR expression was significantly reduced exclusively in the brains of hGFAP-CreERT2:IRf/f mice treated with Tx (named GFAP-IR KO mice; Figure 1A). IR mRNA expression was absent from GFP-targeted astrocytes in the hypothalamus of GLAST-IR KO mice (GLASTCreERT2:IRf/f mice injected with Tx) and crossed with tdTomato/eGFP mice, whereas IR mRNA was present in astrocytes of GLAST-IR wild-type (WT) mice (Figures 1B and S1C).Table 1Specificity and Efficiency of Inducible Cre-Mediated Recombination in Adult Mice Heterozygous for GLASTCreERT:tdTomato/eGFP Treated with TamoxifenSpecificity (%/Section)Hypothalamus (%)% GFAP/GFP61.8 ± 6.5 (n = 11)% S100β/GFP45.7 ± 2.4 (n = 9)Efficiency (%/Section)Hypothalamus (%)% GFP/GFAP27.0 ± 8.5 (n = 11)% GFP/S100β54.9 ± 3.3 (n = 21) Open table in a new tab Figure 1In Vivo and Ex Vivo Ablation of Astrocytic IRs Reduces Insulin Signaling and Glucose Availability in AstrocytesShow full caption(A) Insulin receptor (IR) mRNA expression levels in purified GFAP-positive cells from brains of adult IR flox/flox (f/f) mice or hGFAP-CreERT2:IRf/f mice after administration with (+) or without (−) tamoxifen (Tx) injection (n = 3–10/group).(B) In situ hybridization combined with immunofluorescence for the visualization of IR mRNA (empty arrows; red, Alexa 647) in the GFP-expressing astrocytes under the promoter of GLAST (green fluorescence) from hypothalamic sections of GLAST-IR WT mice and GLAST-IR KO mice crossed with tdTomato/eGFP reporter mice (see also Figure S1; Table 1).(C) Percentage of positive colocalization of pAkt and GFAP-positive cells quantified in the hypothalamus of GFAP-IR WT mice and GFAP-IR KO mice 15 min after vehicle (saline) or insulin injection (i.p.; 3 IU/kg bw) (n = 4 mice/group) (see also Figure S2 for peripheral tissue).(D) Protein levels of IRβ and GAPDH in primary hypothalamic astrocytes of IRf/f male mice treated with adenovirus-driven GFP expression (WT; n = 3) or driven Cre recombinase with GFP expression (KO; n = 3).(E) IR mRNA expression levels in primary hypothalamic astrocytes with (WT) or without (KO) IRs (n = 6/ group).(F and G) Western blots (F) and quantification (G) of the ratio between phosphorylated Akt in serine 473 (pAktSer473) and total Akt protein levels in primary hypothalamic astrocytes with (WT) or without (KO) IRs 5 min after vehicle or insulin stimulation (1 μM; n = 3/group).(H–K) Cellular accumulation of 2-DG6P (in pmol/5 μg of protein; n = 6–8/group) (H), glycolytic rate (n = 35 replicates/group from four different experimental cultures) (I), L-Lactate production levels in medium (in mM; n = 4/group) (J), and glycogen content (ng of glycogen/μg of protein; n = 4/group) in primary hypothalamic astrocytes with (WT) or without (KO) IRs (K).(L and M) Basal mitochondrial respiration (OCR; pmo of oxygen/min per 1 μg of DNA: n = 35 replicates/group from four different experimental cultures) (L) and CPT1C expression levels (n = 4/group) in primary hypothalamic astrocytes with (WT) or without (KO) IRs (M).(N and O) Etomoxir effect on basal mitochondrial respiration (OCR) (N) or maximal substrate oxidation (pmol of oxygen/min per 1 μg of DNA) (O) in hypothalamic astrocytes with (WT) or without (KO) IRs treated with vehicle (veh) or etomoxir (etomox: 40 μm) (n = 12–36 replicates/4 different experimental cultures) (see also Figure S3A).Akt, protein kinase B; CPT1C, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GLAST, glutamate aspartate transporter; IR, insulin receptor; OCR, oxygen consumption rate; pAkt, phosphorylation in Serine 473 of Akt; Tx, tamoxifen. ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001; ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗p < 0.05.

Finally, we confirmed that insulin treatment enhanced protein kinase B (Akt) activation in hypothalamic GFAP-positive cells of GFAP-IR WT mice (IRf/f mice treated with Tx), but not in GFAP-IR KO mice (Figure 1C). In contrast, similar levels of Akt activation were observed in peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues (e.g., liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue) of mice with or without IRs in astrocytes (Figure S2), demonstrating that the loss of IRs in astrocytes uniquely reduced insulin signaling activation in astrocytes of the brain. Next, we assessed the impact of IR ablation on glucose availability in astrocyte cultures from the hypothalamus of IRf/f male pups at postnatal day 1 in which IR deletion was induced by adenovirus Cre-mediated recombination. First, we confirmed that adenoviral-based vectors mediated Cre-recombination widely in astrocyte cultures, succeeding in reducing IRβ protein levels (Figure 1D), IR expression levels (Figure 1E), and the ability of astrocytes to phosphorylate Akt following insulin administration (Figures 1F and 1G). Moreover, the loss of IRs in astrocytes resulted in a lower glucose uptake upon stimulation with glucose (Figure 1H), consistent with a reduced glycolytic rate (Figure 1I), lower GLUT-1 expression levels (WT: 1.00 ± 0.09, n = 6 versus KO: 0.63% ± 0.09% of WT values, n = 6; p < 0.02) and decreased L-lactate efflux (Figure 1J) in those glial cells. However, no differences were observed in cellular glycogen content among experimental groups (Figure 1K). Despite having a lower glycolytic flux, astrocytes without IRs exhibited higher basal mitochondrial respiration (Figure 1L), and this was associated with higher expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C), the key enzyme responsible for long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria (Figure 1M). To corroborate that the lack of IRs in astrocytes elevated mitochondrial fatty acid (beta)-oxidation for compensation of reduced glucose uptake, we used etomoxir to inhibit CPT1C and thus fatty acid oxidation. Indeed, etomoxir reduced basal mitochondrial respiration (Figure 1N) and maximal substrate oxidation (Figure 1O), without causing changes in glycolytic rate (Figure S3A). Next, we examined whether insulin signaling in astrocytes controls mitochondrial responses to glucose. We found that hypothalamic astrocytes of GFAP-IR WT mice responded to elevated systemic glucose levels by reducing the overall mitochondrial area, whereas there was no such significant change in hypothalamic astrocytes of GFAP-IR KO mice (Figure S3B). Despite having no reduced cytosolic mitochondria area, astrocytes from the hypothalamus of GFAP-IR KO mice did have a reduced mitochondrial aspect ratio, a parameter reflecting mitochondrial length, due to fewer elongated mitochondria (asterisks; Figures 2A and 2B ), and an increase in the presence of autophagosomes (arrows; Figures 2C and 2D) in response to elevated blood glucose. Both parameters remained unchanged in GFAP-IR WT mice. To verify a morphological impact following loss of astrocytic IRs in vivo, and given the effect of insulin-related peptides on astroglial differentiation (Toran-Allerand et al., 1991Toran-Allerand C.D. Bentham W. Miranda R.C. Anderson J.P. Insulin influences astroglial morphology and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in organotypic cultures.Brain Res. 1991; 558: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the morphology of hypothalamic astrocytes was affected following loss of IRs in vivo. While postnatal astrocyte-specific loss of IRs did not alter the total number of hypothalamic GFAP-positive cells (GFAP-IR WT: 93.7 ± 4.4: n = 39 versus GFAP-IRKO: 80.7 ± 5.6: n = 39 astrocyte number /field), fewer (Figure 2E) and shorter (Figure 2F) primary astrocyte processes were quantified in GFAP-IR KO mice compared to levels in GFAP-IR WT mice (Figure 2G), indicating a potentially altered interaction with surrounding cells. A comparable reduction in the number of primary projections was also seen in extra-hypothalamic areas, such as the hippocampus (Figure S3C), whereas no changes were detected in the length of the astrocyte processes in this area (Figure S3D). To evaluate glucose sensing in the hypothalamus in response to systemic glucose fluctuations, we examined c-Fos immunoreactivity in specific hypothalamic areas following intraperitoneal (i.p.) glucose injection. GFAP-IR KO mice had a reduced number of glucose-induced, activated (c-Fos) cells in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) (Figures 3A and 3B ). No significant differences were observed in response to elevated blood glucose levels in the number of c-Fos immunoreactive cells in other hypothalamic areas analyzed, including the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) (Figure 3B). Even though peripheral glucose injection increased the total number of c-Fos-labeled cells in the ARC of both groups, mice lacking astrocytic IRs had less of an increase in the number of glucose-activated pro-opio-melanocortin (POMC) neurons (c-Fos-immunoreactive) in response to i.p. glucose (Figures 3C and 3D). Cellular adaptations to fluctuations in nutrient availability involve the regulation of mitochondrial function, a process intimately associated with changes in neuron-mitochondrial network complexity (Baltzer et al., 2010Baltzer C. Tiefenböck S.K. Frei C. Mitochondria in response to nutrients and nutrient-sensitive pathways.Mitochondrion. 2010; 10: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Mandl et al., 2009Mandl J.

Metab. 2009; 20: 194-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that POMC neurons of mice lacking IRs in astrocytes had reduced mitochondrial density (Figure S3E) and mitochondrial coverage (Figure S3F) in response to high peripheral glucose levels, whereas no differences were found in GFAP-IR WT mice. Both groups had an elevated mitochondrial aspect ratio in POMC neurons in response to i.p. glucose injection (Figure S3G). GFAP-IR KO mice had an increase in the number of autophagosomes (asterisks; Figures 4A and 4B ) and disrupted mitochondria (arrows; mitochondria in autophagic processes) in the cytosol of POMC neurons (Figures 4C and 4D). Finally, we examined the number of ER-mitochondrial contacts of POMC neurons, contacts essential for structural support and functional interorganellar communication regulating Ca2+ homeostasis, metabolism of glucose, phospholipids, and cholesterol (Tubbs et al., 2014Tubbs E. Theurey P. Vial G. Bendridi N. Bravard A. Chauvin M.A. Ji-Cao J. Zoulim F. Bartosch B. Ovize M. et al.Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) integrity is required for insulin signaling and is implicated in hepatic insulin resistance.Diabetes. 2014; 63: 3279-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). After peripheral glucose administration, GFAP-IR KO mice had higher number of ER-mitochondrial contacts in POMC neurons relative to GFAP-IR WT mice (arrows; Figures 4E and 4F). Taken together, these findings suggest that the lack of IRs in astrocytes induces alterations in neural-mitochondrial network responses to glucose, which may impair POMC neurons to appropriately respond to cellular metabolic needs. To evaluate whether our observed changes in astrocyte morphology and c-Fos activation affect hypothalamic neural circuits controlling systemic glucose homeostasis, we analyzed the patterns of glial ensheathment of perikaryal membranes of immunoreactive POMC neurons in the hypothalamus. Mice lacking IRs exclusively in astrocytes responded to peripheral glucose injection by less glial coverage of POMC neurons than occurred in control mice (Figure 5A), as indicated by using electron (Figure 5B) or confocal microscopy (Figure 5C; GFAP-IR WT + glucose i.p.: 26.81 ± 2.2; n = 15 versus GFAP-IR KO + glucose i.p.: 11.8% ± 1.9% of astrocyte coverage per POMC cell; n = 12; p < 0.002). Finally, we analyzed the impact of glial coverage changes on the number and type of synaptic profiles on POMC neurons. There was an increase in the number of symmetric synapses (Figure S3H) and no change in the number of asymmetric synapses (Figure S3I) in response to peripheral glucose injection in both groups. However, the overall changes in the synaptic profile of POMC neurons in GFAP-IR KO mice resulted in an elevated number of total synapses on POMC perikarya (Figures 5D and 5E). To determine whether astrocyte-specific IRs are involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis, we examined dynamic feeding behavior and glucose regulatory responses to altered systemic glucose availability. First, mice with or without astrocytic IRs were subjected to a fasting-induced hyperphagia paradigm to generate a physiological situation of reduced glucose availability. GFAP-IR KO mice were unable to appropriately curb the hyperphagic response to fasting, likely due to insufficient availability or delayed appearance of glucose in the brain (Figure 6A). Consistent with that possibility, GFAP-IR KO mice had a reduced suppression of fasting-induced hyperphagia in response to the administration of peripheral glucose (Figure 6B), a finding which may reflect reduced activation of POMC neurons. We also observed that GFAP-IR KO mice failed to efficiently readjust systemic glucose levels when subjected to hyperglycemia induced by peripheral glucose injection (Figure 6C). This effect was associated with a delayed response to increased peripheral insulin levels (Figure 6D). Consistent with that, those mice exhibited a higher area under the curve (AUC) of blood glucose levels in response to peripheral insulin injection (Figure 6E). Next, we evaluated feeding in response to a peripheral glucose deficiency elicited by the glucoprivic agent, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) (Smith and Epstein, 1969Smith G.P. Epstein A.N. Increased feeding in response to decreased glucose utilization in the rat and monkey.Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 217: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The expected physiological hyperphagic response was absent in mice lacking astrocytic insulin signaling (Figure 6F), demonstrating that astrocyte-specific loss of IRs impacts in vivo glucose metabolism. GFAP-positive astrocytes only represent one subpopulation of astrocytes in the brain. We assessed whether the functional role of astrocytic insulin signaling in regulating glucose metabolism is restricted to the GFAP astrocyte-specific population or is also relevant for other astroglial populations such as GLAST-expressing astrocytes.

We show that methylation is a PTM of dynamic microtubules and that the histone methyltransferase SET-domain-containing 2 (SETD2), which is responsible for H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) of histones, also methylates α-tubulin at lysine 40, the same lysine that is marked by acetylation on microtubules. Methylation of microtubules occurs during mitosis and cytokinesis and can be ablated by SETD2 deletion, which causes mitotic spindle and cytokinesis defects, micronuclei, and polyploidy. These data now identify SETD2 as a dual-function methyltransferase for both chromatin and the cytoskeleton and show a requirement for methylation in maintenance of genomic stability and the integrity of both the tubulin and histone codes.

SET-domain-containing 2 (SETD2), also known as HYPB and KMT3A, is a histone methyltransferase responsible for histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) of chromatin, an epigenetic mark associated with gene transcription (Edmunds et al., 2008Edmunds J.W.

SETD2 is able to add a methyl group to a di-methylated lysine to generate a trimethyl mark, as well as de novo mono- and di-methylation to generate a trimethyl mark on histone H3 (Wagner and Carpenter, 2012Wagner E.J.

Sun X.J. Zhang Y.L. Kuang Y. Hu C.Q. Wu W.L. Shen S.H. Du T.T. Li H. He F. et al.Histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase Hypb/Setd2 is required for embryonic vascular remodeling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently, the concept of the “histone code” has been parlayed into a “tubulin code” hypothesis to describe how PTMs distinctly mark subsets of microtubules in the cytoskeleton (Verhey and Gaertig, 2007Verhey K.J. Gaertig J. The tubulin code.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2152-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The cytoskeleton is a network of fibers that maintains cell shape, allows cells to move and divide, and forms specialized structures such as cilia and microvilli. Although the name implies a stable structure, many parts of the cytoskeleton are dynamic and constantly remodeled, with some parts assembled while others are dismantled. An important component of the cytoskeleton is microtubules, which are built from heterodimers of α- and β-tubulin and are required for many diverse functions such as mitosis, where they form the mitotic spindle and participate in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (Walczak and Heald, 2008Walczak C.E. Heald R. Mechanisms of mitotic spindle assembly and function.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2008; 265: 111-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The “tubulin code” hypothesis posits that PTMs of specific tubulin subunits within the polymer direct microtubule-based functions at that location (Verhey and Gaertig, 2007Verhey K.J. Gaertig J. The tubulin code.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2152-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Indeed, PTMs including phosphorylation, detyrosination, polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, and acetylation are enriched on specialized microtubule structures such as centrioles and basal bodies, neuronal axons, and primary cilia (Janke, 2014Janke C. The tubulin code: molecular components, readout mechanisms, and functions.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 206: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, Song and Brady, 2015Song Y. Brady S.T. Post-translational modifications of tubulin: pathways to functional diversity of microtubules.Trends Cell Biol. 2015; 25: 125-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Most microtubule PTMs have been discovered serendipitously, usually as the result of generation of antibodies later found to react with specific modified residues of α- or β-tubulin (Magiera and Janke, 2013Magiera M.M. Janke C. Investigating tubulin posttranslational modifications with specific antibodies.Methods Cell Biol. 2013; 115: 247-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and as a result, the complete repertoire of microtubule PTMs has yet to be fully elucidated. PTMs of microtubules serve many functions, such as recognition by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which can regulate microtubule dynamics and function. These modifications play important roles during mitosis, where, for example, detyrosination guides chromosome congression (Barisic et al., 2015Barisic M. Silva e Sousa R. Tripathy S.K. Magiera M.M. Zaytsev A.V. Pereira A.L. Janke C. Grishchuk E.L. Maiato H. Mitosis. Microtubule detyrosination guides chromosomes during mitosis.Science. 2015; 348: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, for many PTMs, the underlying functionality is still undetermined (Janke, 2014Janke C. The tubulin code: molecular components, readout mechanisms, and functions.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 206: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, Song and Brady, 2015Song Y. Brady S.T. Post-translational modifications of tubulin: pathways to functional diversity of microtubules.Trends Cell Biol. 2015; 25: 125-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Compared to PTMs that specify stable cytoplasmic microtubules, which are easily detected by purification or immunoreactivity with PTM-specific antibodies, little is known about PTMs associated with mitotic spindle and midbody microtubules that direct their dynamic polymerization and depolymerization during mitosis (Kwok and Kapoor, 2007Kwok B.H. Kapoor T.M. Microtubule flux: drivers wanted.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Walczak and Heald, 2008Walczak C.E. Heald R. Mechanisms of mitotic spindle assembly and function.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2008; 265: 111-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Importantly, the readers, writers, and erasers of the histone and tubulin codes identified to date have been distinct, even for PTMs such as acetylation that occur on both histones and microtubules. As a result, in settings such as cancer, where defects in chromatin remodelers such as SETD2 occur with a high frequency, research to understand how loss of readers, writers, and erasers such as SETD2 contribute to disease pathogenesis has focused on chromatin and the impact of loss of H3K36me3 on the epigenome. We have now found that SETD2 is required for the integrity of both the histone and tubulin codes, providing evidence for cross-talk between the epigenome and cytoskeleton. We show that methylation is a PTM of mitotic microtubules and that SETD2 binds to and methylates α-tubulin. Methylation occurs at lysine 40 (α-TubK40me3), the same residue that is acetylated on microtubules (α-TubK40ac). Methylation occurs on the spindle during mitosis and the midbody during cytokinesis, and SETD2-null cells exhibit loss of spindle and midbody methylation and numerous mitotic and cytokinesis defects, identifying a role for microtubule methylation by SETD2 in genomic stability. We found that endogenous SETD2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with α-tubulin in SETD2-proficient human 786-0 cells (Figure 1A). A direct interaction between SETD2 and α-tubulin was demonstrated by incubating SETD2 protein immunopurified using a SETD2-specific antibody with human recombinant α-tubulin protein (TUBA1A), followed by co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) of α-tubulin (Figure 1B). SETD2 binding and H3K36 methylation of histone tails coincides with histone acetylation at active genes (Edmunds et al., 2008Edmunds J.W. Mahadevan L.C. Clayton A.L. Dynamic histone H3 methylation during gene induction: HYPB/Setd2 mediates all H3K36 trimethylation.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 406-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), leading us to ask if acetylation, which is known to occur on microtubules, might play a role in SETD2 binding to α-tubulin. Treatment of cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that selectively inhibits class I and II mammalian HDACs, including the α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 (Matsuyama et al., 2002Matsuyama A. Shimazu T. Sumida Y. Saito A. Yoshimatsu Y. Seigneurin-Berny D. Osada H. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Khochbin S. et al.In vivo destabilization of dynamic microtubules by HDAC6-mediated deacetylation.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6820-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), had no effect on SETD2 binding to α-tubulin (data not shown), and co-expression of wild-type EGFP-α-tubulin and mutant EGFP-K40R α-tubulin (which cannot be acetylated) with full-length SETD2 revealed that SETD2 could co-immunoprecipitate with both wild-type and K40R mutant α-tubulins, indicating that the interaction of SETD2 with α-tubulin did not require acetylation of K40 (Figure 1C). To determine the α-tubulin binding domain of SETD2, we constructed a series of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing human SETD2 fragments purified from Escherichia coli (Figures 1D and 1E). While SETD2 protein levels expressed from various constructs differed, we consistently observed that the presence of the SET (Drosophila Su(var)3–9 and “Enhancer of zeste” proteins) domain was required for binding to α-tubulin. As shown in Figure 1E, GST pull-down assays revealed that the SET domain was sufficient for binding to α-tubulin, consistent with an enzyme-substrate relationship. To identify potential sites for methylation on lysine residue(s) of tubulin, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of α-tubulin for motifs that fit the structural requirements for substrates of SETD2 and its corresponding demethylase, JMJD2A (also known as KDM4A, JHDM3A, and TDRD14A). The catalytic domain of both SETD2 and JMJD2A requires a curved or flexible structure containing Pro at +2 or Gly-Gly at +3 and +4 after the substrate lysine residue (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z. Zang J. Kappler J. Hong X. Crawford F. Wang Q. Lan F. Jiang C. Whetstine J. Dai S. et al.Structural basis of the recognition of a methylated histone tail by JMJD2A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10818-10823Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Nelson et al., 2006Nelson C.J. Santos-Rosa H. Kouzarides T. Proline isomerization of histone H3 regulates lysine methylation and gene expression.Cell. 2006; 126: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We found only one candidate lysine within α-tubulin that met these structural requirements, K40, where the sequence “KTIGG” is a good fit as a structural motif for a SETD2 or JMJD2A substrate. A biotin-tagged peptide around this region, IQPDGGMPSDKTIGGGDDSF-biotin, could co-immunoprecipitate a GST-tagged SET domain (Figure 1F). An antibody raised against the H3K36me3 epitope also could immunoprecipitate α-tubulin (Figure S1A), supporting this as a potential recognition site for SETD2 methylation. To further confirm these data, we generated a polyclonal antibody against trimethylated K40 peptide of α-tubulin (α-TubK40me3). This antibody had minimal cross-reactivity with a di-methylated K40 peptide and no detectable cross reactivity with mono- or un-methylated K40 peptides (Figure S1B). We found that similar to the commercially available H3K36me3 antibody, the α-TubK40me3-specific antibody generated to the K40 peptide also detected and immunoprecipitated native α-tubulin (Figure S1A), indicating similarity between the trimethyl SETD2-epitope of chromatin and the methyl-specific epitope recognized by the α-TubK40me3-specific antibody. The specificity of the α-TubK40me3 antibody was demonstrated using a peptide competition assay where an α-TubK40me3 peptide strongly, and α-TubK40me2 peptide modestly, competed for binding of the α-TubK40me3-specific antibody to α-tubulin, with little loss of immunoreactivity seen with mono-methylated, acetylated, or unmethylated α-TubK40 peptides (Figure S1C). Because binding of the SET domain to α-tubulin and recognition by both H3K36me3 and α-TubK40me3-specific antibodies suggested that SETD2 could be methylating microtubules, we immunostained mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using either the α-TubK40me3-specific or H3K36me3 antibodies together with either α-tubulin (Figures 2A and 2B ) or acetylated α-tubulin (Figures S2A and S2B). In mitotic cells, in addition to the expected immunostaining of chromatin, we observed distinct immunoreactivity with both the α-TubK40me3 and H3K36me3 antibodies on spindle microtubules, but not astral microtubules (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). During metaphase, methylation of spindle microtubules was concentrated near the spindle poles as shown in Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B and illustrated with a line profile through a representative metaphase spindle stained with α-TubK40me3 and α-tubulin antibodies (Figure S2C). Methylation at the minus ends of bundled microtubules becomes especially evident when the spindle midzone compacts into the midbody during cytokinesis (Figures 2A–2C, S2A, and S2B).Figure S2Microtubule Methylation during Mitosis and Cytokinesis in MEFs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Representative images of cells stained using acetylated α-tubulin (red) and H3K36me3 (green) antibodies, counterstained with DAPI (blue).

The fluorescent intensities of all three channels along the white line are depicted on the corresponding color curves. To further investigate the methylation state of spindle microtubules, we stained cells with a series of pan mono-, di-, and trimethyl lysine antibodies (Guo et al., 2014Guo A. Gu H. Zhou J. Mulhern D. Wang Y. Lee K.A. Yang V. Aguiar M. Kornhauser J. Jia X. et al.Immunoaffinity enrichment and mass spectrometry analysis of protein methylation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition to the expected mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of chromatin (Figures 2, S2, and S3), we also observed immunoreactivity of spindle and midbody microtubules using a pan tri-methyl lysine (Kme3) antibody (Figure S3A), but not, however, with the pan mono-methyl (Kme1) or di-methyl (Kme2) lysine antibodies (Figures S3B and S3C). Antibodies to methyl lysine marks made by the other histone methyltransferases H3K4me3 (COMPASS complex) or H3K27me3 (EZH2) showed no immunoreactivity for these microtubule structures (Figure S3D). Together, these data identify a methylated epitope on mitotic microtubules recognized by the α-TubK40me3, H3K36me3, and pan-Kme3 antibodies rather than non-specific association of histones/chromatin with this structure. A striking feature of microtubule trimethylation was the apparently exclusive relationship between trimethylation and the well-known α-tubulin K40ac mark, particularly during the later stages of mitosis. Co-staining with α-TubK40me3 and H3K36me3 and α-tubulin antibodies showed trimethylation on the distal, minus ends of midbodies distinct from chromatin H3K36me3 staining (Figures 2A–2C), while co-staining with α-TubK40me3, H3K36me3, and acetylated α-tubulin showed the methyl mark occurred more distally on the midbody than the acetyl mark (Figures S2A and S2B). As shown in Figure 2C, quantification (n = 66) of the fluorescence intensity of trimethyl- and acetyl-specific antibody staining along the length of the midbody revealed an inverse relationship between acetylation and trimethylation. This suggested the possibility that microtubule acetylation and methylation were reciprocal marks, and focused our attention on the site for microtubule acetylation, lysine 40 of α-tubulin (Janke, 2014Janke C. The tubulin code: molecular components, readout mechanisms, and functions.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 206: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, Verhey and Gaertig, 2007Verhey K.J. Gaertig J. The tubulin code.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2152-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To examine whether methylation at K40 of α-tubulin occurs in vivo, we used mass spectrometry to analyze human myc-tagged α-tubulin (TUBA1B-myc) proteins purified from HEK293T cells. Trimethylation at K40 of α-tubulin was recognized by peaks corresponding to calculated molecular weights from the N and C terminus of the peptide (Figure 3A). We next determined if α-tubulin could be directly methylated by SETD2. SETD2 is able to add a methyl group to di-methylated lysine to generate H3K36me3, but is also capable of de novo mono- and di-methylation to generate a trimethyl mark (Wagner and Carpenter, 2012Wagner E.J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 15701-15707Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), indicating SETD2 substrate recognition is not confined to di-methylated lysine residues. Using purified α-tubulin, bovine microtubules, or histones (control) as substrates, in vitro methylation assays revealed that recombinant SETD2 was able to methylate both tubulin proteins and histones (Figures 3B and S4A). Polymerization of microtubules was not required for methylation by SETD2, since SETD2 methylated both soluble tubulin and polymerized microtubules, as well as recombinant α-tubulin protein (Figures 3B and S4A). Together, these data demonstrate that trimethylation of α-tubulin is a new PTM of microtubules and identify SETD2 as a dual-function methyltransferase that can directly methylate both histones and α-tubulin.Figure S4Tubulin Methylation by SETD2, Related to Figures 3B and 4AShow full caption(A) In vitro methylation of recombinant α-tubulin.

To definitively determine if SETD2 methylates mitotic microtubules, we generated a line of Setd2flox/flox mice, isolated Setd2flox/flox MEFs, transfected these cells with a tamoxifen-inducible ER-Cre expression vector, and isolated stable Cre-expressing cells after selection with blasticidin. Setd2flox/flox;ER-Cre MEFs were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen or vehicle, and loss of SETD2 activity was observed by the absence of SETD2 protein (Figure S4B), loss of α-TubK40me3-immunoreactivity of α-tubulin (Figure S4B), and loss of nuclear H3K36me3 immunoreactivity (Figure 4A). Immunostaining with H3K36me3 and α-TubK40me3 antibodies confirmed that methylation of microtubules was lost in Setd2-knockout MEFs (Figure 4A). To examine the impact of loss of Setd2 during mitosis, we clonally selected stable Setd2flox/flox;ER-Cre MEFs and carried out live-cell imaging. In control cells, the average time in mitosis was 1.4 hr (SD = 0.57, n = 63, and illustrated using time-lapse images in Figure 4B). However, after 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment and excision of Setd2, the average time in mitosis was increased to 2.0 hr (SD = 0.68, n = 37, and illustrated using time-lapse images in Figure 4B), with Setd2-null cells taking significantly longer to complete mitosis (p ≤ 0.0001, unpaired Welch t test) and often failing to undergo cytokinesis, resulting in retained cytoplasmic bridges (Figure 4B) and binucleation (Movie S1). This phenotype suggested that acute loss of Setd2 function caused mitotic and/or cytokinesis defects. Consistent with induction of the tetraploid checkpoint (Ganem and Pellman, 2007Ganem N.J. Pellman D. Limiting the proliferation of polyploid cells.Cell. 2007; 131: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), tamoxifen-induced excision of Setd2 caused dramatic increase in the sub-G1 population, and death of Setd2-null cells (Figure S5A). When we analyzed the DNA content of clonally derived Setd2flox/flox MEFs stably expressing tamoxifen-inducible ER-Cre (S4 cells) by flow cytometry after exclusion of the majority of the sub-G1 population (Figures S5B and S5C), we observed increased ploidy, with ∼30% of S4 cells becoming polyploid (>4N complement of DNA) upon loss of Setd2 compared to ∼14% of controls (Figure 5A). To eliminate the possibility that the observed increase in >4N DNA was due to cell aggregation, we used automated confocal microscopy to capture images from 3,000 cells 72 hr after Cre-mediated excision of Setd2 and quantitated DAPI fluorescence intensities and DAPI staining area by dot plot using algorithms developed in Pipeline Pilot (Accelrys) (Figure 5B). Consistent with the flow cytometry data, polyploidy in Setd2-knockout cells (∼41%) was significantly higher than controls (∼10% and 17% in pharmacologic and genetic controls). To rule out artifacts associated with clonal selection, we also assessed polynucleation in a pool of stably expressing Setd2flox/flox;ER-Cre MEFs after tamoxifen-induced Cre-mediated excision of Setd2. In three biological replicates counting 500 cells each (1,500 cells), polynucleation in Setd2 knockout cells was significantly higher than pharmacological and genetic controls (Figures 5C and 5D). Together, these data demonstrated that loss of Setd2 led to an increase in ploidy and polynucleation.Figure 5Loss of Setd2 Induces PolyploidyShow full caption(A) FACS analysis of Setd2−/− cells (red) and Setd2+/+ controls (blue).

https://openalex.org/W2516993644,"Regulation of stem and progenitor cell populations is critical in the development, maintenance, and regeneration of tissues. Here, we define a novel mechanism by which a niche-secreted RNase, angiogenin (ANG), distinctively alters the functional characteristics of primitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) compared with lineage-committed myeloid-restricted progenitor (MyePro) cells. Specifically, ANG reduces the proliferative capacity of HSPC while simultaneously increasing proliferation of MyePro cells. Mechanistically, ANG induces cell-type-specific RNA-processing events: tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNA (tiRNA) generation in HSPCs and rRNA induction in MyePro cells, leading to respective reduction and increase in protein synthesis. Recombinant ANG protein improves survival of irradiated animals and enhances hematopoietic regeneration of mouse and human HSPCs in transplantation. Thus, ANG plays a non-cell-autonomous role in regulation of hematopoiesis by simultaneously preserving HSPC stemness and promoting MyePro proliferation. These cell-type-specific functions of ANG suggest considerable therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2517005034,"Classically, hormones elicit specific cellular responses by activating dedicated receptors. Nevertheless, the biosynthesis and turnover of many of these hormone molecules also produce chemically related metabolites. These molecules may also possess hormonal activities; therefore, one or more may contribute to the adaptive plasticity of signaling outcomes in host organisms. Here, we show that a catabolite of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), namely phaseic acid (PA), likely emerged in seed plants as a signaling molecule that fine-tunes plant physiology, environmental adaptation, and development. This trait was facilitated by both the emergence-selection of a PA reductase that modulates PA concentrations and by the functional diversification of the ABA receptor family to perceive and respond to PA. Our results suggest that PA serves as a hormone in seed plants through activation of a subset of ABA receptors. This study demonstrates that the co-evolution of hormone metabolism and signaling networks can expand organismal resilience."

Here we describe the high resolution structures of tubulin in complex with both monomethyl auristatin E and F and unambiguously define the trans-configuration of both ligands at the Val-Dil amide bond in their tubulin bound state. Moreover, we illustrate how peptidic vinca-site agents carrying terminal carboxylate residues may exploit an observed extended hydrogen bond network with the M-loop Arg278 to greatly improve the affinity of the corresponding analogs and to maintain the M-loop in an incompatible conformation for productive lateral tubulin-tubulin contacts in microtubules. Our results highlight a potential, previously undescribed molecular mechanism by which peptidic vinca-site agents maintain unparalleled potency as microtubule-destabilizing agents."
https://openalex.org/W2511561561,"Background Plasmodium falciparum encoded histidine rich protein (HRP2) based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used in India. Deletion of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes contributes to false negative test results, and large numbers of such deletions have been reported from South America, highlighting the importance of surveillance to detect such deletions. Methods This is the first prospective field study carried out at 16 sites located in eight endemic states of India to assess the performance of PfHRP2 based RDT kits used in the national malaria control programme. In this study, microscopically confirmed P. falciparum but RDT negative samples were assessed for presence of pfhrp2, pfhrp3, and their flanking genes using PCR. Results Among 1521 microscopically positive P. falciparum samples screened, 50 were negative by HRP2 based RDT test. Molecular testing was carried out using these 50 RDT negative samples by assuming that 1471 RDT positive samples carried pfhrp2 gene. It was found that 2.4% (36/1521) and 1.8% (27/1521) of samples were negative for pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, respectively. However, the frequency of pfhrp2 deletions varied between the sites ranging from 0–25% (2.4, 95% CI; 1.6–3.3). The frequency of both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion varied from 0–8% (1.6, 95% CI; 1.0–2.4). Conclusion This study provides evidence for low level presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deleted P. falciparum parasites in different endemic regions of India, and periodic surveillance is warranted for reliable use of PfHRP2 based RDTs."
https://openalex.org/W2510306467,"Background Class specific deprescribing guidelines could help clinicians taper and stop medications no longer needed or which may be causing more harm than benefit. We set out to develop methodology to create such guidelines using evidence-based methods for guideline development, evidence synthesis and recommendation rating. Methods and Findings Using a comprehensive checklist for a successful guideline enterprise, we conducted a national modified Delphi consensus process to identify priorities for deprescribing guidelines, then conducted scoping exercises to identify feasible topics, and sequentially developed three deprescribing guidelines. We selected guideline development team members for clinical expertise; a GRADE member worked with staff to ensure guideline development processes were followed. We conducted or used systematic searches and reviews of deprescribing trials of selected drug classes, reviews or systematic reviews of drug class effectiveness, reviews of reviews of drug class harm and narrative syntheses of contextual questions to inform recommendations and guideline development. Our 8 step process for guideline development included defining scope and purpose, developing a logic model to guide the process and generate key clinical questions, setting criteria for admissible evidence and conducting systematic reviews, synthesizing evidence considering additional contextual information and performing quality estimates, formulating recommendations and providing strength estimations, adding clinical considerations, conducting clinical and stakeholder review and finally updating content pre-publication. Innovative aspects of the guideline development process included synthesizing evidence for outcomes of tapering or stopping medication, and incorporating evidence for medication harm into the recommendation strength rating. Through the development of three deprescribing guidelines (for proton pump inhibitors, benzodiazepine receptor agonists and antipsychotics) and associated decision-support algorithms, we were able to gradually hone the methodology; each guideline will be published separately. Conclusion Our methodology demonstrates the importance of searching for short and long-term outcomes, showing the benefits of deprescribing and studying patient preferences. This publication will support development of future deprescribing guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2518102671,"Introduction This study evaluated an intervention for people with aphasia delivered in a novel virtual reality platform called EVA Park. EVA Park contains a number of functional and fantastic locations and allows for interactive communication between multiple users. Twenty people with aphasia had 5 weeks’ intervention, during which they received daily language stimulation sessions in EVA Park from a support worker. The study employed a quasi randomised design, which compared a group that received immediate intervention with a waitlist control group. Outcome measures explored the effects of intervention on communication and language skills, communicative confidence and feelings of social isolation. Compliance with the intervention was also explored through attrition and usage data. Results There was excellent compliance with the intervention, with no participants lost to follow up and most (18/20) receiving at least 88% of the intended treatment dose. Intervention brought about significant gains on a measure of functional communication. Gains were achieved by both groups of participants, once intervention was received, and were well maintained. Changes on the measures of communicative confidence and feelings of social isolation were not achieved. Results are discussed with reference to previous aphasia therapy findings."
https://openalex.org/W2509580098,"Objective(s) Describe unintentional drowning deaths in rivers, creeks and streams (rivers) in Australia and identify risk factors to inform prevention. Design & Setting This study is a cross-sectional, total population audit of all unintentional fatal drownings in Australian rivers between 1-July-2002 and 30-June-2012 using Australian coronial data. A modified Bonferroni test has been applied, deeming statistical significance p<0.03 and p<0.04 respectively. Results Rivers (n = 770; 26.6%) were the leading location among the 2,892 people who died from unintentional fatal drowning. This is a rate of 0.37/100,000 people / annum. Within river drowning deaths common groups include; males (80.4%), adults (85.3%), adults who have consumed alcohol (25.5%), people who fell in (21.3%), people involved in non-aquatic transport incidents (18.2%) and locals (74.0%). Children were 1.75 times more likely than adults (p<0.04) to drown in rivers as a result of a fall and adults 1.50 times more likely to drown in rivers as a result of watercraft incidents when compared to children. When compared to males, females were 2.27 and 4.45 times respectively more likely to drown in rivers as a result of incidents involving non-aquatic transport (p<0.04) and being swept away by floodwaters (p<0.04). Males were 2.66 and 4.27 times respectively more likely to drown in rivers as a result of watercraft incidents (p<0.04) and as a result of jumping in (p<0.04) when compared to females. Conclusion(s) While rivers are the leading location for drowning in Australia, little is understood about the risks. This study has identified key groups (males, adults, locals) and activities. While males were more likely to drown, the risk profile for females differed."
https://openalex.org/W2514776927,"Crown rot (Phytophthora cactorum) causes significant economic losses in strawberry production. The best control strategy would be to use resistant cultivars, but polygenically inherited resistance makes the breeding of the garden strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) challenging. The diploid wild strawberry Fragaria vesca Hawaii 4 genotype was shown previously to have resistance against crown rot. To explore the resistance mechanisms, we inoculated the roots of Hawaii 4 with P. cactorum in a novel in vitro hydroponic system to minimize interference caused by other microbes. Major reprogramming of the root transcriptome occurred, involving 30% of the genes. The surveillance system of the plant shifted from the development mode to the defense mode. Furthermore, the immune responses as well as many genes involved in the biosynthesis of the defense hormones jasmonic acid, ethylene and salicylic acid were up-regulated. Several major allergen-like genes encoding PR-10 proteins were highly expressed in the inoculated plants, suggesting that they also have a crucial role in the defense responses against P. cactorum. Additionally, flavonoids and terpenoids may be of vital importance, as several genes involved in their biosynthesis were up-regulated. The cell wall biosynthesis and developmental processes were down-regulated, possibly as a result of the down-regulation of the key genes involved in the biosynthesis of growth-promoting hormones brassinosteroids and auxin. Of particular interest was the expression of potential resistance genes in the recently identified P. cactorum resistance locus RPc-1. These new findings help to target the breeding efforts aiming at more resistant strawberry cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2513087893,"Image texture analysis is a noninvasive technique for quantifying intratumoral heterogeneity, with derived texture features reported to be closely related to the treatment outcome of tumors. Gastric cancer is one of the most common tumors and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although trastuzumab is associated with a survival gain among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric cancer, optimal patient selection is challenging. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CT texture features of HER2-positive gastric cancer were related to the survival rate after trastuzumab treatment.Patients diagnosed with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer from February 2007 to August 2014 were retrospectively selected. Using in-house built software, histogram features (kurtosis and skewness) and gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) features (angular second moment [ASM], contrast, entropy, variance, and correlation) were derived from the CT images of HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer in 26 patients. All the patients were followed up for more than 6 months, with no confirmed deaths. The patients were dichotomized into a good and poor survival group based on cutoff points of overall survival of 12 months. A receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to test the ability of each texture parameter to identify the good survival group. Kaplan-Meier curves for patients above and below each threshold were constructed. Using a threshold of >265.8480 for contrast, >488.3150 for variance, and ≤0.1319×10-3. for correlation, all of the area under the ROC curves showed fair accuracy (>0.7). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed statistically significant survival difference between two groups according to optimal cutoff values of contrast, variance, correlation and ASM. However, as this study had a small number of patients, a further study with a larger population will be needed to validate the results.Heterogeneous texture features on CT images were associated with better survival in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer who received trastuzumab-based treatment. Therefore, texture analysis shows potential to be a clinically useful imaging biomarker providing additional prognostic information for patient selection."
https://openalex.org/W2508148629,"This study aimed to identify the computed tomography characteristics of treatment-naïve patients with lung adenocarcinoma and known driver mutations in EGFR, KRAS, or ALK. Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB–IV) and known mutations in EGFR, KRAS, or ALK were assessed. The radiological findings for the main tumor and intra-thoracic status were retrospectively analyzed in each group, and the groups’ characteristics were compared. We identified 265 treatment-naïve patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, who had EGFR mutations (n = 159), KRAS mutations (n = 55), or ALK rearrangements (n = 51). Among the three groups, we evaluated only patients with stage IIIB–IV lung adenocarcinoma who had EGFR mutations (n = 126), KRAS mutations (n = 35), or ALK rearrangements (n = 47). We found that ground-glass opacity at the main tumor was significantly more common among EGFR-positive patients, compared to ALK-positive patients (p = 0.009). Lymphadenopathy was significantly more common among ALK-positive patients, compared to EGFR-positive patients (p = 0.003). Extranodal invasion was significantly more common among ALK-positive patients, compared to EGFR-positive patients and KRAS-positive patients (p = 0.001 and p = 0.049, respectively). Lymphangitis was significantly more common among ALK-positive patients, compared to EGFR-positive patients (p = 0.049). Pleural effusion was significantly less common among KRAS-positive patients, compared to EGFR-positive patients and ALK-positive patients (p = 0.046 and p = 0.026, respectively). Lung metastases were significantly more common among EGFR-positive patients, compared to KRAS-positive patients and ALK-positive patients (p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively). In conclusion, EGFR mutations were associated with ground-glass opacity, KRAS-positive tumors were generally solid and less likely to metastasize to the lung and pleura, and ALK-positive tumors tended to present with lymphadenopathy, extranodal invasion, and lymphangitis. These mutation-specific imaging characteristics may be related to the biological differences between these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2510707473,"Confocal microscopy is widely used to visualize gene expression patterns and developmental processes in plants. However, the imaging of plant tissue can be challenging due to its opacity, which often makes previous immersion in a clearing agent necessary. Many commonly-used chemicals suffer either from their incompatibility with fluorescent proteins or their complex and lengthy application. 2,2'-thiodiethanol (TDE) has recently been described as a clearing agent with an emphasis on high resolution microscopy due to its potential to adjust the refractive index. Here, we evaluate the use of TDE-based clearing for confocal as well as two-photon microscopy in various Arabidopsis thaliana tissue types. We demonstrate that tissue fixation is a mandatory prerequisite for the use of TDE, in order to preserve tissue integrity and fluorescent protein activity. TDE concentrations between 50-70% are a good compromise for imaging of technically challenging tissue to achieve good clearing without affecting fluorescent protein activity. TDE-based clearing is simple and rapid to use and allows for a flexible experimental setup while facilitating high quality imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2515985107,"Brain glucose hypometabolism is a common feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that cognition is improved by providing AD patients with an alternate energy source: ketones derived from either ketogenic diet or supplementation with medium chain triglycerides (MCT). Recently, data on the neuroprotective capacity of MCT-derived medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) suggest 8-carbon and 10-carbon MCFA may have cognition-enhancing properties which are not related to ketone production. We investigated the effect of 8 week treatment with MCT8, MCT10 or sunflower oil supplementation (5% by weight of chow diet) in 21 month old Wistar rats. Both MCT diets increased ketones plasma similarly compared to control diet, but MCT diets did not increase ketones in the brain. Treatment with MCT10, but not MCT8, significantly improved novel object recognition memory compared to control diet, while social recognition increased in both MCT groups. MCT8 and MCT10 diets decreased weight compared to control diet, where MCFA plasma levels were higher in MCT10 groups than in MCT8 groups. Both MCT diets increased IRS-1 (612) phosphorylation and decreased S6K phosphorylation (240/244) but only MCT10 increased Akt phosphorylation (473). MCT8 supplementation increased synaptophysin, but not PSD-95, in contrast MCT10 had no effect on either synaptic marker. Expression of Ube3a, which controls synaptic stability, was increased by both MCT diets. Cortex transcription via qPCR showed that immediate early genes related to synaptic plasticity (arc, plk3, junb, egr2, nr4a1) were downregulated by both MCT diets while MCT8 additionally down-regulated fosb and egr1 but upregulated grin1 and gba2. These results demonstrate that treatment of 8- and 10-carbon length MCTs in aged rats have slight differential effects on synaptic stability, protein synthesis and behavior that may be independent of brain ketone levels."
https://openalex.org/W2510882680,"Purpose To investigate the influence of overexposure to light emitting diode (LED)-derived light with various wavelengths on mouse ocular surface. Methods LEDs with various wavelengths were used to irradiate C57BL/6 mice at an energy dose of 50 J/cm2, twice a day, for 10 consecutive days. The red, green, and blue groups represented wavelengths of 630 nm, 525 nm, and 410 nm, respectively. The untouched group (UT) was not exposed to LED light and served as the untreated control. Tear volume, tear film break-up time (TBUT), and corneal fluorescein staining scores were measured on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured in the cornea and conjunctiva using a multiplex immunobead assay at day 10. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Flow cytometry, 2’7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay, histologic analysis, immunohistochemistry with 4-hydroxynonenal, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were also performed. Results TBUT of the blue group showed significant decreases at days 7 and 10, compared with the UT and red groups. Corneal fluorescein staining scores significantly increased in the blue group when compared with UT, red, and green groups at days 5, 7, and 10. A significant increase in the corneal levels of IL-1β and IL-6 was observed in the blue group, compared with the other groups. The blue group showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species production in the DCF-DA assay and increased inflammatory T cells in the flow cytometry. A significantly increased TUNEL positive cells was identified in the blue group. Conclusions Overexposure to blue light with short wavelengths can induce oxidative damage and apoptosis to the cornea, which may manifest as increased ocular surface inflammation and resultant dry eye."
https://openalex.org/W2515929107,"Rationale Infants born to diabetic or obese mothers are at risk of respiratory distress and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), conceivably through fuel-mediated pathogenic mechanisms. Prior research and preventative measures focus on controlling maternal hyperglycemia, but growing evidence suggests a role for additional circulating fuels including lipids. Little is known about the individual or additive effects of a maternal high-fat diet on fetal lung development. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a maternal high-fat diet, alone and alongside late-gestation diabetes, on lung alveologenesis and vasculogenesis, as well as to ascertain if consequences persist beyond the perinatal period. Methods A rat model was used to study lung development in offspring from control, diabetes-exposed, high-fat diet-exposed and combination-exposed pregnancies via morphometric, histologic (alveolarization and vasculogenesis) and physiologic (echocardiography, pulmonary function) analyses at birth and 3 weeks of age. Outcomes were interrogated for diet, diabetes and interaction effect using ANOVA with significance set at p≤0.05. Findings prompted additional mechanistic inquiry of key molecular pathways. Results Offspring exposed to maternal diabetes or high-fat diet, alone and in combination, had smaller lungs and larger hearts at birth. High-fat diet-exposed, but not diabetes-exposed offspring, had a higher perinatal death rate and echocardiographic evidence of PPHN at birth. Alveolar mean linear intercept, septal thickness, and airspace area (D2) were not significantly different between the groups; however, markers of lung maturity were. Both diabetes-exposed and diet-exposed offspring expressed more T1α protein, a marker of type I cells. Diet-exposed newborn pups expressed less surfactant protein B and had fewer pulmonary vessels enumerated. Mechanistic inquiry revealed alterations in AKT activation, higher endothelin-1 expression, and an impaired Txnip/VEGF pathway that are important for vessel growth and migration. After 3 weeks, mortality remained highest and static lung compliance and hysteresis were lowest in combination-exposed offspring. Conclusion This study emphasizes the effects of a maternal high-fat diet, especially alongside late-gestation diabetes, on pulmonary vasculogenesis, demonstrates adverse consequences beyond the perinatal period and directs attention to mechanistic pathways of interest. Findings provide a foundation for additional investigation of preventative and therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing pulmonary morbidity in at-risk infants."
https://openalex.org/W2518386440,"An organism's phenotype is the product of its environment and genotype, but an ancestor's environment can also be a contributing factor. The recent increase in caloric intake and decrease in physical activity of developed nations' populations is contributing to deteriorating health and making the study of the longer term impacts of a changing lifestyle a priority. The dietary habits of ancestors have been shown to affect phenotype in several organisms, including humans, mice, and the fruit fly. Whether the ancestral dietary effect is purely environmental or if there is a genetic interaction with the environment passed down for multiple generations, has not been determined previously. Here we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate the genetic, sex-specific, and environmental effects of a high fat diet for three generations' on pupal body weights across ten genotypes. We also tested for genotype-specific transgenerational effects on metabolic pools and egg size across three genotypes. We showed that there were substantial differences in transgenerational responses to ancestral diet between genotypes and sexes through both first and second descendant generations. Additionally, there were differences in phenotypes between maternally and paternally inherited dietary effects. We also found a treated organism's reaction to a high fat diet was not a consistent predictor of its untreated descendants' phenotype. The implication of these results is that, given our interest in understanding and preventing metabolic diseases like obesity, we need to consider the contribution of ancestral environmental experiences. However, we need to be cautious when drawing population-level generalization from small studies because transgenerational effects are likely to exhibit substantial sex and genotype specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2515269559,"Pharmacotherapy is an effective therapeutic option for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Understanding the patterns of medication treatment is crucial for clinical practice. This study employed nationwide population-based data to elucidate the initiation and persistence of pharmacotherapy (immediate-release methylphenidate [IR-MPH], osmotic controlled-release formulations of methylphenidate [OROS-MPH] and atomoxetine [ATX]) for youths with ADHD in Taiwan.Patients first receiving an ADHD diagnosis at age 18 or younger between January 2000 and December 2009 (n = 112,140; mean age at ADHD diagnosis: 7.7 years) were selected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. All patients were monitored through December 31, 2011, with an average follow-up time of 5.8 years. The initiation of ADHD drug therapy was defined as the first patient prescription, and discontinuation was defined as the cessation of ADHD medication for 180 days or longer.Within the first year after ADHD diagnosis, 47.3%, 14.4%, and 0.8% of the patients were prescribed IR-MPH, OROS-MPH, and ATX, respectively. Regarding the patients prescribed IR-MPH, OROS-MPH, and ATX, 17.8%, 12.6%, and 18.8%, respectively, received the prescription only once and never returned for a drug refill, and 51.0%, 38.9%, and 58.8%, respectively, discontinued drug therapy within 1 year after the first prescription. Male sex and neuropsychiatric comorbidities were associated with higher probabilities of being prescribed one of the medications. An older age at first prescription and a higher daily dose of prescription were significant predictors of early discontinuation of ADHD medication.The current findings suggest that IR-MPH is the most frequently prescribed drug for ADHD treatment in Taiwan. Patients treated with OROS-MPH possessed the highest persistence rate, whereas those treated with ATX had the lowest persistence rate. The results provide insight into the delivery of pediatric mental health services and have crucial implications for ADHD medication treatment in real clinical settings."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of different G. lamblia assemblages and detect mixed infections among patients with giardiasis.The cross-section survey was conducted among patients attending the FIOCRUZ in Rio de Janeiro. In order to discriminate the genetic assemblages/sub-assemblages, G. lamblia isolates were characterized by PCR-RFLP and qPCR using four loci genes (bg, gdh, tpi and orfC4). Of the 65 positive samples, 41 (63.1%) were successfully amplified by nested-PCR of bg and gdh genes. Among them, 16 were typed as sub-assemblage AII, 7 as BIII, 4 as BIV and 8 as a mixture of BIII and BIV. After the analysis by qPCR assay, a total of 55 (84.6%) samples were amplified using at least one locus: bg gene was amplified in 38 (58.5%) samples, gdh in 41 (63.1%), tpi in 39 (60%), and orfC4 in 39 (60%). Multilocus genotyping results showed that 29 (52.7%) samples belonged to Assemblage A and 26 (47.3%) samples belonged to Assemblage B. In 2011 and 2012, 20 (74.1%) samples belonged to Assemblage A and 7 (25.9%) belonged to Assemblage B. In subsequent years (2013-2015) there was a predominance of Assemblage B, 19 (67.9%) versus 9 (32.1%) Assemblage A.This is the first time that Assemblage B of G. lamblia was reported in human clinical samples from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and is the first report about genetic characterization using four genes. The qPCR assemblage-specific showed no mixed infections by Assemblages A and B. A switch in genetic profile over the years was observed, firstly predominance of Assemblage A and lastly of Assemblage B."
https://openalex.org/W2507406994,"Exploring the interplay between information spreading and epidemic spreading is a topic that has been receiving increasing attention. As an efficient means of depicting the spreading of information, which manifests as a cascade phenomenon, awareness cascading is utilized to investigate this coupled transmission. Because in reality, different individuals facing the same epidemic will exhibit distinct behaviors according to their own experiences and attributes, it is important for us to consider the heterogeneity of individuals. Consequently, we propose a heterogeneous spreading model. To describe the heterogeneity, two of the most important but radically different methods for this purpose, the degree and k-core measures, are studied in this paper through three models based on different assumptions. Adopting a Markov chain approach, we succeed in predicting the epidemic threshold trend. Furthermore, we find that when the k-core measure is used to classify individuals, the spreading process is robust to these models, meaning that regardless of the model used, the spreading process is nearly identical at the macroscopic level. In addition, the k-core measure leads to a much larger final epidemic size than the degree measure. These results are cross-checked through numerous simulations, not only of a synthetic network but also of a real multiplex network. The presented findings provide a better understanding of k-core individuals and reveal the importance of considering network structure when investigating various dynamic processes."

This study assessed malaria related perceptions, care seeking behavior and anti-malarial drug use in malaria endemic settings of Ethiopia.Data were generated from a community based cross-sectional study conducted among 798 households during January 2014 as part of a larger household behavioral study in three malaria endemic districts of Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed using SPSS 17.0 and STATA 12.0.In this study, only 76.1% of the respondents associated malaria to mosquito bite, and incorrect beliefs and perceptions were noted. Despite moderate level of knowledge (estimated mean = 62.2, Std Err = 0.7, 95% CI: 60.6-63.8%), quite high favorable attitude (overall estimated mean = 91.5, Std Err = 0.6, 95% CI: 90.1-92.9%) were recorded towards malaria preventive measures. The mean attitude score for prompt care seeking, appropriate use of anti-malarial drugs, LLIN use and Indoor Residual Spray acceptance was 98.5 (Std Err = 0.4, 95% CI:97.5-99.4), 92.7 (Std Err = 0.6 95% CI:91.5-93.9), 88.8 (Std Err = 0.5, 95% CI:85.5-92.1) and 86.5 (Std Err = 1.2, 95% CI: 83.9-89.1), respectively. The prevalence of fever was 2.9% (116/4107) and of the study participants with fever, 71.9% (95% CI: 65.5-78.3%) sought care and all of them consulted formal health care system. However, only 17 (19.8%) sought care within 24 hours after onset of fever. The frequency of care seeking was higher (77.8%, n = 21/27) and more prompt (28.6%, 6/21) for children under five as compared to old age groups despite it was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, higher median time of seeking first care was observed among Muslims and people who did not attend school (p < 0.05). Of those who used anti-malarial drugs, 9.1% indicated that they used it inappropriately through saving and/or sharing. Irregular availability of anti-malarial drugs; irregular presence of frontline health workers and misconceptions were mentioned to contribute to delayed care seeking and irrational use of anti-malarial drugs.Although care seeking behavior for febrile illness was quite high in this community, the habit of prompt care seeking was very limited. Thus, malaria prevention and control programs need to take into account local misconceptions and wrong perceptions, and health system factors to achieve optimal health seeking behavior in such malaria endemic settings."
https://openalex.org/W2517534835,"It remains unknown to what extent the human visual system interprets information about complex scenes without conscious analysis. Here we used visual masking techniques to assess whether illusory contours (Kanizsa shapes) are perceived when the inducing context creating this illusion does not reach awareness. In the first experiment we tested perception directly by having participants discriminate the orientation of an illusory contour. In the second experiment, we exploited the fact that the presence of an illusory contour enhances performance on a spatial localization task. Moreover, in the latter experiment we also used a different masking method to rule out the effect of stimulus duration. Our results suggest that participants do not perceive illusory contours when they are unaware of the inducing context. This is consistent with theories of a multistage, recurrent process of perceptual integration. Our findings thus challenge some reports, including those from neurophysiological experiments in anaesthetized animals. Furthermore, we discuss the importance to test the presence of the phenomenal percept directly with appropriate methods."

https://openalex.org/W2508482379,"Supernumerary teeth and tooth agenesis are common morphological anomalies in humans. We previously obtained evidence that supernumerary maxillary incisors form as a result of the successive development of the rudimentary maxillary incisor tooth germ in Usag-1 null mice. The development of tooth germs is arrested in Runx2 null mice, and such mice also exhibit lingual epithelial buds associated with the upper molars and incisors. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential crosstalk between Usag-1 and Runx2 during tooth development. In the present study, three interesting phenomena were observed in double null Usag-1-/-/Runx2-/- mice: the prevalence of supernumerary teeth was lower than in Usag-1 null mice; tooth development progressed further compared than in Runx2 null mice; and the frequency of molar lingual buds was lower than in Runx2 null mice. Therefore, we suggest that RUNX2 and USAG-1 act in an antagonistic manner. The lingual bud was completely filled with odontogenic epithelial Sox2-positive cells in the Usag-1+/+/Runx2-/- mice, whereas almost no odontogenic epithelial Sox2-positive cells contributed to supernumerary tooth formation in the rudimentary maxillary incisors of the Usag-1-/-/Runx2+/+ mice. Our findings suggest that RUNX2 directly or indirectly prevents the differentiation and/or proliferation of odontogenic epithelial Sox2-positive cells. We hypothesize that RUNX2 inhibits the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and/or Wnt signaling pathways regulated by USAG-1, whereas RUNX2 expression is induced by BMP signaling independently of USAG-1."
https://openalex.org/W2510197353,"Despite the significant responsibility that physicians have in healthcare delivery, we know surprisingly little about why physician practice styles vary within or across institutions. Estimating variation in physician practice styles is complicated by the fact that patients are rarely randomly assigned to physicians. This paper uses the quasi-random assignment of patients to physicians in emergency departments (EDs) to show how physicians vary in their treatment of patients with minor injuries. The results reveal a considerable degree of variation in practice styles within EDs; physicians at the 75th percentile of the spending distribution spend 20% more than physicians at the 25th percentile. Observable physician characteristics do not explain much of the variation across physicians, but there is a significant degree of sorting between physicians and EDs over time, with high-cost physicians sorting into high-cost EDs as they gain experience. The results may shed light on why some EDs remain persistently higher-cost than others."
https://openalex.org/W2513550761,"In the last years, the interactions of flavonoids with protein kinases (PKs) have been described by using crystallographic experiments. Interestingly, different orientations have been found for one flavonoid inside different PKs and different chemical substitutions lead to different orientations of the flavonoid scaffold inside one PK. Accordingly, orientation predictions of novel analogues could help to the design of flavonoids with high PK inhibitory activities. With this in mind, we studied the binding modes of 37 flavonoids (flavones and chalcones) inside the cyclin-dependent PK CDK1 using docking experiments. We found that the compounds under study adopted two different orientations into the active site of CDK1 (orientations I and II in the manuscript). In addition, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models using CoMFA and CoMSIA methodologies were constructed to explain the trend of the CDK1 inhibitory activities for the studied flavonoids. Template-based and docking-based alignments were used. Models developed starting from docking-based alignment were applied for describing the whole dataset and compounds with orientation I. Adequate R2 and Q2 values were obtained by each method; interestingly, only hydrophobic and hydrogen bond donor fields describe the differential potency of the flavonoids as CDK1 inhibitors for both defined alignments and subsets. Our current application of docking and QSAR together reveals important elements to be drawn for the design of novel flavonoids with increased PK inhibitory activities."
https://openalex.org/W2510728719,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a zinc-dependent enzyme, and plays a crucial role in extracellular matrix degeneration, inflammation and tissue remodeling. However, the relationship between MMP-9 and somatic cell count (SCC) in goat milk and the role of MMP-9 in the regulation of mastitis are still unknown. In this study, we found MMP-9 was predominantly expressed in the spleen, intestine and mammary gland. The SCC in goat milk was positively correlated with MMP-9 expression, and staphylococcus aureus could markedly increase MMP-9 expression in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) in dosage and time dependent manner. We also demonstrated that SB-3CT, an inhibitor of MMP-9, promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in GMEC. Thus, MMP-9 may emerge as an easily measurable and sensitive parameter that reflects the number of somatic cells present in milk and a regulatory factor of apoptosis in GMEC."
https://openalex.org/W2511341418,"The NEIL1 DNA glycosylase is one of eleven mammalian DNA glycosylases that partake in the first step of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. NEIL1 recognizes and cleaves mainly oxidized pyrimidines from DNA. The past decade has witnessed the identification of an increasing number of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in BER enzymes including phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation, which modulate enzyme function. In this work, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of phosphorylation sites in human NEIL1 expressed in human cells. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed phosphorylation at three serine residues: S207, S306, and a third novel site, S61. We expressed, purified, and characterized phosphomimetic (glutamate) and phosphoablating (alanine) mutants of the three phosphorylation sites in NEIL1 revealed by the MS analysis. All mutant enzymes were active and bound tightly to DNA, indicating that phosphorylation does not affect DNA binding and enzyme activity at these three serine sites. We also characterized phosphomimetic mutants of two other sites of phosphorylation, Y263 and S269, reported previously, and observed that mutation of Y263 to E yielded a completely inactive enzyme. Furthermore, based on sequence motifs and kinase prediction algorithms, we identified the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) as the kinase involved in the phosphorylation of NEIL1. JNK1, a member of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, was detected in NEIL1 immunoprecipitates, interacted with NEIL1 in vitro, and was able to phosphorylate the enzyme at residues S207, S306, and S61."
https://openalex.org/W2517320120,"Climbing fibres and parallel fibres compete for dendritic space on Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Normally, climbing fibres populate the proximal dendrites, where they suppress the multiple small spines typical of parallel fibres, leading to their replacement by the few large spines that contact climbing fibres. Previous work has shown that ephrins acting via EphA4 are a signal for this change in spine type and density. We have used an in vitro culture model in which to investigate the ephrin effect on Purkinje cell dendritic spines and the role of integrins in these changes. We found that integrins α3, α5 and β4 are present in many of the dendritic spines of cultured Purkinje cells. pFAK, the main downstream signalling molecule from integrins, has a similar distribution, although the intenstity of pFAK staining and the percentage of pFAK+ spines was consistently higher in the proximal dendrites. Activating integrins with Mg2+ led to an increase in the intensity of pFAK staining and an increase in the proportion of pFAK+ spines in both the proximal and distal dendrites, but no change in spine length, density or morphology. Blocking integrin binding with an RGD-containing peptide led to a reduction in spine length, with more stubby spines on both proximal and distal dendrites. Treatment of the cultures with ephrinA3-Fc chimera suppressed dendritic spines specifically on the proximal dendrites and there was also a decrease of pFAK in spines on this domain. This effect was blocked by simultaneous activation of integrins with Mn2+. We conclude that Eph/ephrin signaling regulates proximal dendritic spines in Purkinje cells by inactivating integrin downstream signalling."

The patients are receiving immunosuppressive therapy to reduce graft rejection, but differential side effects have been related to calcineurin and mTOR inhibitor administration regarding tumor recurrence and nephrotoxicity. The in vitro studies showed that Tacrolimus exerted a more potent pro-apoptotic effect than Everolimus (Huh 7>Hep 3B>HepG2), being sirolimus only active in Hep3B cell line. Tacrolimus and Everolimus exerted potent antiproliferative properties in Huh 7 and Hep3B in which cells Sirolimus was inactive. Interestingly, Tacrolimus- and Everolimus-dependent G0/G1 cell accumulation occurred as a consequence of drastic reduction in S, as well as in S and G2+M phases, respectively. The in vivo studies support data on the more effective antitumoral properties of Everolimus, eventual risk of pro-angiogenic tumoral properties and nephrotoxicity of Tacrolimus, and pro-proliferative properties of Sirolimus in tumors developed in nude mice."
https://openalex.org/W2514253507,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a disease of high importance to global public health. Studies into the population structure of MTB have become vital to monitoring possible outbreaks and also to develop strategies regarding disease control. Although Chile has a low incidence of MTB, the current rates of migration have the potential to change this scenario. We collected and analyzed a total of 458 M. tuberculosis isolates (1 isolate per patient) originating from all 15 regions of Chile. The isolates were genotyped using the spoligotyping method and the data obtained were analyzed and compared with the SITVIT2 database. A total of 169 different patterns were identified, of which, 119 patterns (408 strains) corresponded to Spoligotype International Types (SITs) and 50 patterns corresponded to orphan strains. The most abundantly represented SITs/lineages were: SIT53/T1 (11.57%), SIT33/LAM3 (9.6%), SIT42/LAM9 (9.39%), SIT50/H3 (5.9%), SIT37/T3 (5%); analysis of the spoligotyping minimum spanning tree as well as spoligoforest were suggestive of a recent expansion of SIT42, SIT50 and SIT37; all of which potentially evolved from SIT53. The most abundantly represented lineages were LAM (40.6%), T (34.1%) and Haarlem (13.5%). LAM was more prevalent in the Santiago (43.6%) and Concepción (44.1%) isolates, rather than the Iquique (29.4%) strains. The proportion of X lineage was appreciably higher in Iquique and Concepción (11.7% in both) as compared to Santiago (1.6%). Global analysis of MTB lineage distribution in Chile versus neighboring countries showed that evolutionary recent lineages (LAM, T and Haarlem) accounted together for 88.2% of isolates in Chile, a pattern which mirrored MTB lineage distribution in neighboring countries (n = 7378 isolates recorded in SITVIT2 database for Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina; and published studies), highlighting epidemiological advantage of Euro-American lineages in this region. Finally, we also observed exclusive emergence of patterns SIT4014/X1 and SIT4015 (unknown lineage signature) that have hitherto been found exclusively in Chile, indicating that conditions specific to Chile, along with the unique genetic makeup of the Chilean population, might have allowed for a possible co-evolution leading to the success of these emerging genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2512813865,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation. CD4(+) T-helper 9 (Th9) cells are closely linked to asthma, helping to regulate inflammation and immunity. Epidemiological studies showed that mycobacteria infections are negatively associated with asthma. Our previous research showed that inactivated Mycobacterium phlei nebulization alleviated the airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation of asthma. However, the relationship between Th9 cells and mycobacteria remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the relationship between Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization and Th9 cells in asthmatic mice. Eighteen Balb/c mice were randomized into 3 groups of 6 mice each (normal control group, asthma control group, and nebulization asthma group [Neb. group]). The Neb. group was nebulized with M. vaccae one month before establishment of the asthmatic model with ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization, and the normal and asthma control groups were nebulized with phosphate-buffered saline. The hyperresponsiveness of the mouse airways was assessed using a non-invasive lung function machine. Lung airway inflammation was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining. Cytokine interlukin-9 (IL-9) concentration and OVA-specific IgE in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The percentages of γδTCR+ CD3+, IL-9+CD3+, IL-10+CD3+ lymphocytes, and IL9+γδT and IL-10+γδT cells were detected by flow cytometry. The airway inflammation and concentration of IL-9 and OVA-specific IgE were significantly reduced in the Neb. group compared to the asthma control group. The Neb. group had lower airway hyperresponsiveness, percentages of γδTCR+CD3+ and IL-9+CD3+ lymphocytes, and IL9+γδT cells, and higher percentages of IL-10+CD3+ lymphocytes and IL-10+γδT cells compared to the asthma control group. Thus, mouse bronchial asthma could be prevented by M. vaccae nebulization. The mechanism could involve M. vaccae-mediated effects on induction of IL-9 secretion and suppression of IL-10 secretion from γδT cells. γδT cells showed prominent IL-10 expression, indicating that they possibly belong to the Th9 family."
https://openalex.org/W2514759889,"The roles of mitochondria in various physiological functions of vascular endothelial cells have been investigated extensively. Morphological studies in relation to physiological functions have been performed. However, there have been few reports of morphological investigations related to stem cell differentiation. This was the first morphological study of mitochondria in relation to endothelial differentiation and focused on quantitative analysis of changes in mitochondrial morphology, number, area, and length during differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into endothelial-like cells. To induce differentiation, we engaged vascular endothelial growth factors and flow-induced shear stress. Cells were classified according to the expression of von Willebrand factor as hMSCs, differentiating cells, and almost fully differentiated cells. Based on imaging analysis, we investigated changes in mitochondrial number, area, and length. In addition, mitochondrial networks were quantified on a single-mitochondrion basis by introducing a branch form factor. The data indicated that the mitochondrial number, area per cell, and length were decreased with differentiation. The mitochondrial morphology became simpler with progression of differentiation. These findings could be explained in view of energy level during differentiation; a higher level of energy is needed during differentiation, with larger numbers of mitochondria with branches. Application of this method to differentiation into other lineages will explain the energy levels required to control stem cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2507896428,"In living organisms, ageing is widely considered to be the result of a multifaceted process consisting of the progressive accumulation of damage over time, having implications both in terms of function and survival. The study of ageing presents several challenges, from the different mechanisms implicated to the great diversity of systems affected over time. In the current study, we set out to identify genes involved in the functional decline of the brain with age and study its relevance in a tissue dependent manner using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Here we report the age-dependent upregulation of genes involved in the metabolic process of fatty acid β-oxidation in the nervous tissue of female wild-type flies. Downregulation of CG10814, dHNF4 and lipid mobilizing genes bmm and dAkh rescues the functional decline of the brain with age, both at the cellular and behaviour level, while over-expression worsens performance. Our data proposes the occurrence of a metabolic alteration in the fly brain with age, whereby the process of β-oxidation of fatty acids experiences a genetic gain-of-function. This event proved to be one of the main causes contributing to the functional decline of the brain with age."

Little is known about public perceptions of these policies and factors that predict their support or opposition. Methods Using a sample of US adults from Amazon Mechanical Turk in May 2015, this paper identifies beliefs about the benefits and costs of regulating e-cigarettes and identifies which of these beliefs predict support for e-cigarette restricting policies. Results A higher proportion of respondents agreed with 8 different reasons to regulate e-cigarettes (48.5% to 83.3% agreement) versus 7 reasons not to regulate e-cigarettes (11.5% to 18.9%). The majority of participants agreed with 7 out of 8 reasons for regulation. When all reasons to regulate or not were included in a final multivariable model, beliefs about protecting people from secondhand vapor and protecting youth from trying e-cigarettes significantly predicted stronger support for e-cigarette restricting policies, whereas concern about government intrusion into individual choices was associated with reduced support. Discussion This research identifies key beliefs that may underlie public support or opposition to policies designed to regulate the marketing and use of e-cigarettes. Advocates on both sides of the issue may find this research valuable in developing strategic campaigns related to the issue. Implications Specific beliefs of potential benefits and costs of e-cigarette regulation (protecting youth, preventing exposure to secondhand vapor, and government intrusion into individual choices) may be effectively deployed by policy makers or health advocates in communicating with the public."
https://openalex.org/W2512702381,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely resistant towards pharmacological therapy. To date, the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib is the only available therapeutic agent with the potential to prolong patient survival. Using the human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Huh7, we analyzed anti-cancer activities of 6 purified havanensin type limonoids isolated from the traditional African medicinal plant Trichilia rubescens Oliv. Our results show that two of the compounds, TR4 (TS3) and TR9 (Rubescin E) reduced hepatoma cell viability, but not primary hepatocyte viability, at TC50s of 5 to 10 μM. These were significantly lower than the TC50s for Sorafenib, the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA or 5-Fluoruracil. In comparison, TR3 (Rubescin D), a limonoid isolated in parallel and structurally highly similar to TR4 and TR9, did not interfere with hepatoma cell viability. Both, TR4 and TR9, but not TR3, induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells and interfered with NF-κB activation. TR4 as well as TR9 significantly supported anti-cancer activities of Sorafenib. In summary, the limonoids TR4 and TR9 exhibit anti-cancer activities and support Sorafenib effects in vitro, having the potential to support future HCC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2512429335,"ChIP-seq experiments detect the chromatin occupancy of known transcription factors in a genome-wide fashion. The comparisons of several species-specific ChIP-seq libraries done for different transcription factors have revealed a complex combinatorial and context-specific co-localization behavior for the identified binding regions. In this study we have investigated human derived ChIP-seq data to identify common cis-regulatory principles for the human transcription factor c-Fos. We found that in four different cell lines, c-Fos targeted proximal and distal genomic intervals show prevalences for either AP-1 motifs or CCAAT boxes as known binding motifs for the transcription factor NF-Y, and thereby act in a mutually exclusive manner. For proximal regions of co-localized c-Fos and NF-YB binding, we gathered evidence that a characteristic configuration of repeating CCAAT motifs may be responsible for attracting c-Fos, probably provided by a nearby AP-1 bound enhancer. Our results suggest a novel regulatory function of NF-Y in gene-proximal regions. Specific CCAAT dimer repeats bound by the transcription factor NF-Y define this novel cis-regulatory module. Based on this behavior we propose a new enhancer promoter interaction model based on AP-1 motif defined enhancers which interact with CCAAT-box characterized promoter regions."
https://openalex.org/W2511694071,"There are quite a number of different metrics of network robustness. This paper addresses the rationality of four metrics of network robustness (the algebraic connectivity, the effective resistance, the average edge betweenness, and the efficiency) by investigating the robust growth of generalized meshes (GMs). First, a heuristic growth algorithm (the Proximity-Growth algorithm) is proposed. The resulting proximity-optimal GMs are intuitively robust and hence are adopted as the benchmark. Then, a generalized mesh (GM) is grown up by stepwise optimizing a given measure of network robustness. The following findings are presented: (1) The algebraic connectivity-optimal GMs deviate quickly from the proximity-optimal GMs, yielding a number of less robust GMs. This hints that the rationality of the algebraic connectivity as a measure of network robustness is still in doubt. (2) The effective resistace-optimal GMs and the average edge betweenness-optimal GMs are in line with the proximity-optimal GMs. This partly justifies the two quantities as metrics of network robustness. (3) The efficiency-optimal GMs deviate gradually from the proximity-optimal GMs, yielding some less robust GMs. This suggests the limited utility of the efficiency as a measure of network robustness."
https://openalex.org/W2509226172,"γ-crystallins are major components of the vertebrate lens but show expression in other tissues as well. Their extralenticular functions remain so far unclear. Here, we explored such roles in the rodent superior olivary complex in which previous analysis demonstrated developmentally regulated expression of Crygd, Cryge and Crygn. Immunohistochemistry with novel antibodies against Crygd/e and Crygn indicate that expression of Crygd/e was moderate and varied between the perinatal superior olivary complex of mice, rats, and gerbils. Crygn-immunoreactivity was more robust and consistently highest in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, but also present in other nuclei of the superior olivary complex. To analyze the function of Crygn in the auditory hindbrain, we used a Crygn allele with a floxed exon 2. Upon pairing with Egr2::Cre mice, exon 2, encoding the first two greek key motifs of Crygn, was deleted in the developing auditory hindbrain. Anatomical analysis of these mice revealed a 20% volume reduction in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and a 7% reduction in the lateral superior olive at postnatal day 25. This was due to cell loss between postnatal days 4 and 25, whereas cell size was unaffected. Auditory brainstem responses showed normal threshold but a significant increase in the amplitude of wave IV. Crygn is hence required for postmigratory survival and proper function of auditory hindbrain neurons. These results ascertain for the first time an essential extralenticular role for γ-crystallins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2516603656,"The transfer of Pb from the soil to crops is a serious food hygiene security problem in China because of industrial, agricultural, and historical contamination. In this study, the characteristics of exogenous Pb transfer from 17 Chinese soils to a popular wheat variety (Xiaoyan 22) were investigated. In addition, bioaccumulation prediction models of Pb in grain were obtained based on soil properties. The results of the analysis showed that pH and OC were the most important factors contributing to Pb uptake by wheat grain. Using a cross-species extrapolation approach, the Pb uptake prediction models for cultivar Xiaoyan 22 in different soil Pb levels were satisfactorily applied to six additional non-modeled wheat varieties to develop a prediction model for each variety. Normalization of the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) to specific soil physico-chemistry is essential, because doing so could significantly reduce the intra-species variation of different wheat cultivars in predicted Pb transfer and eliminate the influence of soil properties on ecotoxicity parameters for organisms of interest. Finally, the prediction models were successfully verified against published data (including other wheat varieties and crops) and used to evaluate the ecological risk of Pb for wheat in contaminated agricultural soils."

https://openalex.org/W2508362561,"Objectives To explain the use of feedback reports for quality improvements by the reasons to participate in quality measuring projects and to identify barriers and facilitators. Design Mixed methods design. Methods In 2009–2011 a national audit and feedback system for physical therapy (Qualiphy) was initiated in the Netherlands. After each data collection round, an evaluation survey was held amongst its participants. The evaluation survey data was used to explain the use of feedback reports by studying the reasons to participate with Qualiphy with correlation measures and logistic regression. Semi-structured interviews with PTs served to seek confirmation and disentangle barriers and facilitators. Results Analysis of 257 surveys (response rate: 42.8%) showed that therapists with only financial reasons were less likely to use feedback reports (OR = 0.24;95%CI = 0.11–0.52) compared to therapists with a mixture of reasons. PTs in 2009 and 2010 were more likely to use the feedback reports for quality improvement than PTs in 2011 (OR = 2.41;95%CI = 1.25–4.64 respectively OR = 3.28;95%CI = 1.51–7.10). Changing circumstances in 2011, i.e. using EHRs and financial incentives, had a negative effect on the use of feedback reports (OR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.20–0.78). Interviews with 12 physical therapists showed that feedback reports could serve as a tool to support and structure quality improvement plans. Barriers were distrust and perceived self-reporting bias on indicator scores. Conclusions Implementing financial incentives that are not well-specified and well-targeted can have an adverse effect on using feedback reports to improve quality of care. Distrust is a major barrier to implementing quality systems."
https://openalex.org/W2512539714,"In testing the hypothesis that long-term potentiation (LTP) maintenance depends on triggered protein synthesis, we found no effect of protein synthesis inhibitors (PSIs) on LTP stabilization. Similarly, some studies reported a lack of effect of PSIs on long-term depression (LTD); the lack of effect on LTD has been suggested to be resulting from the short time recordings. If this proposal were true, LTD might exhibit sensitivity to PSIs when the recording intervals were enough long. We firstly induced LTD by a standard protocol involving low frequency stimulation, which is suitable for eliciting NMDAR-LTD in CA1 area of hippocampal slices obtained from juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats. This LTD was persistent for intervals in range of 8–10 h. Treating slices with anisomycin, however, did not interfere with the magnitude and persistence of this form of LTD. The failure of anisomycin to block synaptic-LTD might be relied on the age of animal, the type of protein synthesis inhibitors and/or the inducing protocol. To verify whether those variables altogether were determinant, NMDA or DHPG was used to chemically elicit LTD recorded up to 10 h on hippocampal slices obtained from middle-aged rats. In either form of LTD, cycloheximide did not interfere with LTD stabilization. Furthermore, DHPG application did show an increase in the global protein synthesis as assayed by radiolabeled methodology indicating that though triggered protein synthesis can occur but not necessarily required for LTD expression. The findings confirm that stabilized LTD in either juvenile, or middle-aged rats can be independent of triggered protein synthesis. Although the processes responsible for the independence of LTD stabilization on the triggered protein synthesis are not yet defined, these findings raise the possibility that de novo protein synthesis is not universally necessary."

Molecular modeling performed for Cu(II)-NSFRY-NH2 complex indicated that the cation-π interactions between Tyr and Cu(II), and also between Phe-Arg led to specific conformation defined as peptide box, in which the metal cation is isolated from the solvent by peptide ligand. Voltammetry experiments enabled to compare the redox properties and stability of copper(II) complexes with NSFRY-NH2 and its analogues (namely: NSFRA-NH2, NSFRF-NH2, NSAAY-NH2, NSAAA-NH2, AAAAA-NH2) as well as to evaluate the contribution of individual amino acid residues to these properties. The obtained results led to the conclusion, that cation-π interactions play a crucial role in the effective stabilization of copper(II) complexes with the fragments of ANF peptide hormone and therefore could control the redox processes in other metalloproteins."

It is unclear whether Cree births are at greater elevated risk of perinatal and infant mortality than other First Nations relative to non-Aboriginal births in Quebec, and if macrosomia may be related.This was a population-based retrospective birth cohort study using the linked birth-infant death database for singleton births to mothers from Cree (n = 5,340), other First Nations (n = 10,810) and non-Aboriginal (n = 229,960) communities in Quebec, 1996-2010. Community type was ascertained by residential postal code and municipality name. The primary outcomes were perinatal and infant mortality.Macrosomia (birth weight for gestational age >90th percentile) was substantially more frequent in Cree (38.0%) and other First Nations (21.9%) vs non-Aboriginal (9.4%) communities. Comparing Cree and other First Nations vs non-Aboriginal communities, perinatal mortality rates were 1.52 (95% confidence intervals 1.17, 1.98) and 1.34 (1.10, 1.64) times higher, and infant mortality rates 2.27 (1.71, 3.02) and 1.49 (1.16, 1.91) times higher, respectively. The risk elevations in perinatal and infant death in Cree communities attenuated after adjusting for maternal characteristics (age, education, marital status, parity), but became greater after further adjustment for birth weight (small, appropriate, or large for gestational age).Cree communities had greater risk elevations in perinatal and infant mortality than other First Nations relative to non-Aboriginal communities in Quebec. High prevalence of macrosomia did not explain the elevated risk of perinatal and infant mortality in Cree communities."
https://openalex.org/W2509666927,"Recombinant expression of proteins has become an indispensable tool in modern day research. The large yields of recombinantly expressed proteins accelerate the structural and functional characterization of proteins. Nevertheless, there are literature reported that the recombinant proteins show some differences in structure and function as compared with the native ones. Now there have been more than 100,000 structures (from both recombinant and native sources) publicly available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive, which makes it possible to investigate if there exist any proteins in the RCSB PDB archive that have identical sequence but have some difference in structures. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic comparative study of the 3D structures of identical naturally purified versus recombinantly expressed proteins. The structural data and sequence information of the proteins were mined from the RCSB PDB archive. The combinatorial extension (CE), FATCAT-flexible and TM-Align methods were employed to align the protein structures. The root-mean-square distance (RMSD), TM-score, P-value, Z-score, secondary structural elements and hydrogen bonds were used to assess the structure similarity. A thorough analysis of the PDB archive generated five-hundred-seventeen pairs of native and recombinant proteins that have identical sequence. There were no pairs of proteins that had the same sequence and significantly different structural fold, which support the hypothesis that expression in a heterologous host usually could fold correctly into their native forms."

In the present study, we aimed to determine if the management of European-derived honey bees (A. mellifera sspp.) could reduce the relative abundance of African-matriline drones at regional mating sites known as drone congregation areas (DCAs). We collected 2,400 drones at six DCAs either 0.25 km or >2.8 km from managed European-derived honey bee apiaries. The maternal ancestry of each drone was determined by Bgl II enzyme digestion of an amplified portion of the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene. Furthermore, sibship reconstruction via nuclear microsatellites was conducted for a subset of 1,200 drones to estimate the number of colonies contributing drones to each DCA. Results indicate that DCAs distant to managed European apiaries (>2.8 km) had significantly more African-matriline drones (34.33% of the collected drones had African mitochondrial DNA) than did DCAs close (0.25 km) to managed European apiaries (1.83% of the collected drones had African mitochondrial DNA). Furthermore, nuclear sibship reconstruction demonstrated that the reduction in the proportion of African matriline drones at DCAs near apiaries was not simply an increase in the number of European matriline drones at the DCAs but also the result of fewer African matriline colonies contributing drones to the DCAs. Our data demonstrate that the management of European honey bee colonies can dramatically influence the proportion of drones with African matrilines at nearby drone congregation areas, and would likely decreasing the probability that virgin European queens will mate with African drones at those drone congregation areas."
https://openalex.org/W2517287401,"Dark adaptation can induce a rapid functional shift in the retina, and after that, the retinal function is believed to remain stable during the continuous dark exposure. However, we found that electroretinograms (ERG) b-waves gradually shifted during 24 hours' dark exposure in rodents. Detailed experiments were designed to explore this non-classical dark adaptation.In vivo ERG recording in adult and developing rodents after light manipulations.We revealed a five-fold decrease in ERG b-waves in adult rats that were dark exposed for 24 hours. The ERG b-waves significantly increased within the first hour's dark exposure, but after that decreased continuously and finally attained steady state after 1 day's dark exposure. After 3 repetitive, 10 minutes' light exposure, the dark exposed rats fully recovered. This recovery effect was eye-specific, and light exposure to one eye could not restore the ERGs in the non-exposed eye. The prolonged dark exposure-induced functional shift was also reflected in the down-regulation on the amplitude of intensity-ERG response curve, but the dynamic range of the responsive light intensity remained largely stable. Furthermore, the ERG b-wave shifts occurred in and beyond classical critical period, and in both rats and mice. Importantly, when ERG b-wave greatly shifted, the amplitude of ERG a-wave did not change significantly after the prolonged dark exposure.This rapid age-independent ERG change demonstrates a generally existing functional shift in the retina, which is at the entry level of visual system."
