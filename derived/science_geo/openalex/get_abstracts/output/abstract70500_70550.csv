https://openalex.org/W2063930716,A group of nonsesquiterpenoid compounds currently used commercially as insecticide synergists possesses a high order of juvenile hormone activity and species specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2048485416,"Many proteins are fully denatured and separated into component polypeptide chains in 6M guanidine hydrochloride containing mercaptoethanol and a chelating agent. In this and similar denaturing solvents, polypeptide chains of molecular weights from 2,000 to 100,000 can be eluted from 6 percent agarose columns and separated according to molecular weight. By this procedure molecular weights may be assigned to proteins (including many normally insoluble in nondenaturing solvents) without the uncertainties that arise when native molecules of unknown shape are studied."

These findings are comparable to the right-ear superiority demonstrated with normal speech sounds, and contrast with the left-ear superiority for musical and other non-speech sounds. It is suggested that the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of speech and non-speech sounds are not differentiated along the dimension of conceptual content."

Pressure measurements in the retial efferent arteries supplying the brain revealed relatively nonpulsatile pressure profiles. These measurements in the anesthetized dolphin demonstrate the pressure-damping effect of the retia mirabile."
https://openalex.org/W1979556458,"A DECREASE in the incidence of pregnancy is caused by exposing recently inseminated female mice to the presence of strange males1. This “Bruce effect” has been demonstrated in the albino mouse, Mus musculus, and the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii2, both of which are spontaneous ovulators3,4. The reduction in the number of pregnancies has been shown to be a consequence of the failure of the fertilized ova to implant and the effect of the strange male is mediated by olfactory stimuli5,6. Other environmental factors can also block pregnancy2."
https://openalex.org/W2058564546,The activity of uroporphyrinogen III cosynthetase is much lower in hemolyzates from mature cattle with congenital erythropoietic porphyria than in hemolyzates from mature normal cattle. The porphyric hemolyzates do not inhibit the cosynthetase activity present in normal hemolyzates or in extracts of mouse spleen.
https://openalex.org/W2009898359,"Puromycin, in dosages that inhibit cerebral protein synthesis and expression of memory in mice, produces swelling of neuronal mitochondria. Acetoxycycloheximide, which inhibits cerebral protein synthesis to the same extent as puromycin, fails to produce swelling of neuronal mitochondria. Puromycin and heximide mixtures produce severe inhibition of protein synthesis, but result in a minimal swelling of neuronal mitochondria and in a decrease of peptidylpuromycin complexes to a level of 30 percent of that following the injection of puromycin alone. It is concluded that swelling of neuronal mitochondria in the presence of puromycin is not due to inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis per se, but is related to a specific action of puromycin on ribosomal protein synthesis. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that peptidyl-puromycin complexes are responsible for mitochondrial swelling."

We describe the theory and experimental demonstration of the superior separation achieved with this new rotor."

https://openalex.org/W2002641660,"Concentration of the radio nuclide beryllium-7, produced by cosmic rays, was measured in waters collected from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This short-lived nuclide is well suited as a tracer for interactions at the air-sea interface and for the measurement of rapid mixing processes in the surface layer of the ocean."

I have shown3–5 that holograms can be produced with ultrasonic waves, and have recently suggested (refs. 6 and 7 and my unpublished results) that some biological information processes can be interpreted on this basis."

https://openalex.org/W2030706874,"WHILE investigating some fundamental interactions of amino-acids with nucleotides, we became interested in the possibility of attaching adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) to an insoluble support. If AMP could be bound to a polymer frame by means of the phosphate function, the result would be a reactive site (template) which bears some resemblance to the amino-acid acceptor terminus of a transfer (soluble) ribonucleic acid (tRNA)1. The similarity is represented schematically in Fig. 1."

https://openalex.org/W2086978141,"STUDIES of the final stages of glycolysis and the initial stages of the citric acid cycle in progressive muscular dystrophy have used indirect methods, such as the determination of serum levels of corresponding metabolites. In this context two facts are interesting: the increase of pyruvicaemia1–4 simultaneous with the decrease of citric acid3,4, and the normality of lactate, α-cetoglutarate and oxalacetate serum values3,4. Only the decrease in the concentration of citric acid would be exclusively specific to progressive muscular dystrophy3,4."
https://openalex.org/W2061227725,"Migratory animals (such as waterfowl, fish, whales, and seals) and large land animals (such as deer, elephant, bear, and cattle) that were hunted for food by aboriginal peoples may be struck, but not killed, by projectile weapons which remain imbedded in the body. Individuals which survive may be killed elsewhere, and the projectile weapon tips may be recovered. Numerous instances are cited. Such exotic artifacts can be mistakenly attributed to cultural contact between distant human groups unless archeologists are aware of this special kind of diffusion process."
