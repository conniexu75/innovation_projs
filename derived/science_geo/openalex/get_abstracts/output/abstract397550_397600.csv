https://openalex.org/W2162943945,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ is a nuclear receptor central to glucose and lipid homeostasis. PPARγ role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is controversial because PPARγ over-expression is a general property of steatotic livers, but its activation by thiazolidinediones reduces hepatic steatosis. Here, we investigated hepatic PPARγ function by using Cre-loxP technology to generate hepatocyte (PPARγΔhep)- and macrophage (PPARγΔmac)-specific PPARγ-knockout mice. Targeted deletion of PPARγ in hepatocytes, and to a lesser extent in macrophages, protected mice against high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Down-regulated expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (SCD1, SREBP-1c, and ACC), lipid transport (CD36/FAT, L-FABP, and MTP), and β-oxidation (PPARα and ACO) was observed in PPARγΔhep mice. Moreover, PPARγΔhep mice showed improved glucose tolerance and reduced PEPCK expression without changes in Pcx, Fbp1, and G6Pc expression and CREB and JNK phosphorylation. In precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs) and hepatocytes, rosiglitazone either alone or in combination with oleic acid increased triglyceride accumulation, an effect that was blocked by the PPARγ antagonist biphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE). PCLSs and hepatocytes from PPARγΔhep mice showed blunted responses to rosiglitazone and oleic acid, whereas the response to these compounds remained intact in PCLSs from PPARγΔmac mice. Collectively, these findings establish PPARγ expression in hepatocytes as a prosteatotic factor in fatty liver disease.—Morán-Salvador, E., López-Parra, M., García-Alonso, V., Titos, E., Martínez-Clemente, M., González-Périz, A., López-Vicario, C., Barak, Y., Arroyo, V., Clària, J.

https://openalex.org/W2066445380,"NAD is a vital redox carrier, and its degradation is a key element of important regulatory pathways. NAD-mediated functions are compartmentalized and have to be fueled by specific biosynthetic routes. However, little is known about the different pathways, their subcellular distribution, and regulation in human cells. In particular, the route(s) to generate mitochondrial NAD, the largest subcellular pool, is still unknown. To visualize organellar NAD changes in cells, we targeted poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity into the mitochondrial matrix. This activity synthesized immunodetectable poly(ADP-ribose) depending on mitochondrial NAD availability. Based on this novel detector system, detailed subcellular enzyme localizations, and pharmacological inhibitors, we identified extracellular NAD precursors, their cytosolic conversions, and the pathway of mitochondrial NAD generation. Our results demonstrate that, besides nicotinamide and nicotinic acid, only the corresponding nucleosides readily enter the cells. Nucleotides (e.g. NAD and NMN) undergo extracellular degradation resulting in the formation of permeable precursors. These precursors can all be converted to cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD. For mitochondrial NAD synthesis, precursors are converted to NMN in the cytosol. When taken up into the organelles, NMN (together with ATP) serves as substrate of NMNAT3 to form NAD. NMNAT3 was conclusively localized to the mitochondrial matrix and is the only known enzyme of NAD synthesis residing within these organelles. We thus present a comprehensive dissection of mammalian NAD biosynthesis, the groundwork to understand regulation of NAD-mediated processes, and the organismal homeostasis of this fundamental molecule."

The newly identified New Delhi MBL (NDM-1) is a new member of this family that shows tight binding to penicillin and cephalosporins. The rapid dissemination of NDM-1 in clinically relevant bacteria has become a global concern. However, no clinically useful inhibitors against MBLs exist, partly due to the lack of knowledge about the catalysis mechanism of this kind of enzyme. Here we report the crystal structure of this novel enzyme in complex with a hydrolyzed ampicillin at its active site at 1.3-Å resolution. Structural comparison with other MBLs revealed a new hydrolysis mechanism applicable to all three subclasses of MBLs, which might help the design of mechanism based inhibitors.—Zhang, H.-M., Hao, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2171427413,"Notch signaling is often and aberrantly activated by hypoxia during tumor progression; however, the exact pathological role of hypoxia-induced Notch signaling in tumor metastasis is as yet poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to define the mechanism of Notch-ligand activation by hypoxia in both primary tumor and bone stromal cells in the metastatic niche and to clarify their roles in tumor progression. We have analyzed the expression profiles of various Notch ligands in 779 breast cancer patients in GEO database and found that the expression of Jagged2 among all five ligands is most significantly correlated with the overall- and metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. The results of our immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for Jagged2 in 61 clinical samples also revealed that both Jagged2 and Notch signaling were strongly upregulated at the hypoxic invasive front. Activation of Jagged2 by hypoxia in tumor cells induced EMT and also promoted cell survival in vitro. Notably, a γ-secretase inhibitor significantly blocked Notch-mediated invasion and survival under hypoxia by promoting expression of E-cadherin and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation. Importantly, Jagged2 was also found to be upregulated in bone marrow stroma under hypoxia and promoted the growth of cancer stem-like cells by activating their Notch signaling. Therefore, hypoxia-induced Jagged2 activation in both tumor invasive front and normal bone stroma has a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis, and Jagged2 is considered to be a valuable prognostic marker and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2088154229,"In response to viral infection, many prokaryotes incorporate fragments of virus-derived DNA into loci called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). The loci are then transcribed, and the processed CRISPR transcripts are used to target invading viral DNA and RNA. The <i>Escherichia coli</i> ""CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense"" (CASCADE) is central in targeting invading DNA. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of an archaeal CASCADE (aCASCADE) from <i>Sulfolobus solfataricus.</i> Tagged Csa2 (Cas7) expressed in <i>S. solfataricus</i> co-purifies with Cas5a-, Cas6-, Csa5-, and Cas6-processed CRISPR-RNA (crRNA). Csa2, the dominant protein in aCASCADE, forms a stable complex with Cas5a. Transmission electron microscopy reveals a helical complex of variable length, perhaps due to substoichiometric amounts of other CASCADE components. A recombinant Csa2-Cas5a complex is sufficient to bind crRNA and complementary ssDNA. The structure of Csa2 reveals a crescent-shaped structure unexpectedly composed of a modified RNA-recognition motif and two additional domains present as insertions in the RNA-recognition motif. Conserved residues indicate potential crRNA- and target DNA-binding sites, and the H160A variant shows significantly reduced affinity for crRNA. We propose a general subunit architecture for CASCADE in other bacteria and Archaea."
https://openalex.org/W1977492069,"Cancer cells recruit monocytes, macrophages and other inflammatory cells by producing abundant chemoattractants and growth factors, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF/CSF-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), to promote tumor growth and dissemination. An understanding of the mechanisms that target cancer cells and regulate tumor microenvironment is essential in designing anticancer therapies. Here, we showed that serum amyloid-A (SAA) and cathelicidin (LL-37) stimulated M-CSF and MCP-1 expression with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration; conversely, lipoxin-A4 (LXA4) and annexin-A1 (ANXA1) inhibited LPS-induced M-CSF and MCP-1 production by human (HepG2) and mouse (H22) hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). The effects of LXA4, ANXA1, SAA and LL-37 were dependent on the activation of their mutual cell-surface receptor formyl peptide receptor-2 (FPR2) and subsequent ROS–MAPK–NF-kB signalings. Furthermore, our results indicated that LPS switched macrophages into an IL-10lowIL-12high M1 profile, whereas M-CSF+MCP-1 and FPR2 agonists skewed them into M2 (IL-10highIL-12low). In that respect, through modulating the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), LXA4 and ANXA1 induced monocyte differentiation into M2a+M2c-like cells and showed antitumorigenetic activities, whereas SAA, LL-37 and M-CSF+MCP-1 led to M2b- or M2d-like polarization, which exacerbated HCC invasion in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Our results suggest that FPR2 has an appreciable pleiotropic regulator role in tumor immunoediting."
https://openalex.org/W1972323332,"Annular protofibrils (APFs) represent a new and distinct class of amyloid structures formed by disease-associated proteins. In vitro, these pore-like structures have been implicated in membrane permeabilization and ion homeostasis via pore formation. Still, evidence for their formation and relevance in vivo is lacking. Herein, we report that APFs are in a distinct pathway from fibril formation in vitro and in vivo. In human Alzheimer disease brain samples, amyloid-β APFs were associated with diffuse plaques, but not compact plaques; moreover, we show the formation of intracellular APFs. Our results together with previous studies suggest that the prevention of amyloid-β annular protofibril formation could be a relevant target for the prevention of amyloid-β toxicity in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2076800824,"Phytosulfokines (PSKs) are sulfated pentapeptides that stimulate plant growth and differentiation mediated by the PSK receptor (PSKR1), which is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase. We identified a putative guanylate cyclase (GC) catalytic center in PSKR1 that is embedded within the kinase domain and hypothesized that the GC works in conjunction with the kinase in downstream PSK signaling. We expressed the recombinant complete kinase (cytoplasmic) domain of AtPSKR1 and show that it has serine/threonine kinase activity using the Ser/Thr peptide 1 as a substrate with an approximate Km of 7.5 μm and Vmax of 1800 nmol min−1 mg−1 of protein. This same recombinant protein also has GC activity in vitro that is dependent on the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Overexpression of the full-length AtPSKR1 receptor in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts raised the endogenous basal cGMP levels over 20-fold, indicating that the receptor has GC activity in vivo. In addition, PSK-α itself, but not the non-sulfated backbone, induces rapid increases in cGMP levels in protoplasts. Together these results indicate that the PSKR1 contains dual GC and kinase catalytic activities that operate in vivo and that this receptor constitutes a novel class of enzymes with overlapping catalytic domains.

(EC 4.6.1.2) are the enzymes that generate production of cyclic GMP (cGMP), which is a key signaling intermediate in eukaryotes. In higher plants, cGMP has been identified as an important molecule involved in regulating a wide variety of physiological effects ranging from chloroplast development and plant hormone-dependent responses to the induction of plant defense responses (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kaplan B. Sherman T. Fromm H. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 2Newton R.P. Roef L. Witters E. Van Onckelen H.

Nitric oxide signaling is thought to stimulate cGMP production in defense and stress responses, but how it generates cGMP is still uncertain (4Leitner M. Vandelle E. Gaupels F. Bellin D. Delledonne M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Wilson I.D. Neill S.J. Hancock J.T. Plant Cell Environ. 2008; 31: 622-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP acts on cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (6Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Yao W. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), various other downstream molecules, and the transcriptome (1Kaplan B. Sherman T. Fromm H. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Maathuis F.J. Plant J. 2006; 45: 700-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to modulate plant responses. As such a diverse group of plant responses has shown direct or indirect dependence on cGMP, we hypothesized that several different functional GCs exist in higher plants and have undertaken to search for them. The strategy we used was based on the assumption that the catalytic center of known GCs was at least in part conserved across the different kingdoms. Consequently, we designed and tested a search motif based on several functionally assigned amino acids in the catalytic domain of known GCs from lower eukaryotes and animals (see Fig. 1A) and identified and experimentally confirmed the first three molecules with GC activity in higher plants (8Kwezi L. Meier S. Mungur L. Ruzvidzo O. Irving H. Gehring C. PLoS one. 2007; 2: e449Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Ludidi N. Gehring C. J. Biol.

PLoS one. 2010; 5: e8904Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). AtGC1 is a soluble protein with the GC domain toward the N terminus but does not contain a heme binding motif essential for nitric oxide binding (9Ludidi N. Gehring C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6490-6494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), indicating that other GCs are likely to be present. Recently, a GC1 homologue has been characterized in Pharbitis nil (morning glory), and the expression of this molecule is regulated by light (11Szmidt-Jaworska A. Jaworski K. Pawelek A. Kocewicz J. J. Plant Growth Regul. 2009; 28: 367-380Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The second functional GC was identified by relaxing the initial search motif and surprisingly is the brassinosteroid receptor AtBRI1. The GC domain is found within the intracellular kinase domain, and it is this region that has been shown to have functional activity in vitro (8Kwezi L. Meier S. Mungur L. Ruzvidzo O. Irving H. Gehring C. PLoS one. 2007; 2: e449Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). AtBRI1 is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR RLK) with both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activity (EC 2.7.12.1) (12Oh M.H. Wang X. Kota U. Goshe M.B. Clouse S.D. Huber S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and was one of several LRR RLKs identified in the screen that all shared a similar kinase-GC domain structure (8Kwezi L. Meier S. Mungur L. Ruzvidzo O. Irving H. Gehring C. PLoS one. 2007; 2: e449Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, another membrane-associated kinase molecule, the wall-associated kinase-like 10 (WAKL10), has also recently been reported to have GC activity in vitro as well as being transcriptionally up-regulated in response to biotic stress (10Meier S. Ruzvidzo O. Morse M. Donaldson L. Kwezi L. Gehring C. PLoS one. 2010; 5: e8904Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). guanylate cyclase BRI1-associated kinase 1 brassinosteroid receptor flagellin sensing 2 kinase domain leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase phytosulfokine PSK receptor wall-associated kinase-like 10 small ubiquitin-like modifier non-sulfated PSK. Among the other LRR RLKs detected in this screen for novel GCs, we identified the phytosulfokine (PSK) receptor AtPSKR1, and its domain organization is shown in Fig. 1B. AtPSKR1 is a typical LRR RLK with an island that binds PSK in its extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, a single transmembrane-spanning domain, and an intracellular kinase domain (13Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Kihara H. Niwa M. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1470-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). PSKR has been identified in several other species where the GC domain is also present (see Fig. 1C), indicating that it is of widespread occurrence. Mutant studies indicate that AtPSKR1 is involved in regulating root elongation (13Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Kihara H. Niwa M. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PSK-α is the natural ligand for AtPSKR1, and it is a pentapeptide that is sulfated on its two tyrosine residues (Y(SO3H)IY(SO3H)TQ). PSK-α was first discovered as a cell proliferation agent essential for low density cell cultures (15Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Several precursor proteins for PSK have been identified in different species that contain an N-terminal secretory signal sequence and a PSK sequence near the C terminus (16Lorbiecke R. Sauter M. Plant Sci. 2002; 163: 321-332Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Yang H. Matsubayashi Y. Nakamura K. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Yang H. Matsubayashi Y. Nakamura K. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cellular activity depends on sulfation of the tyrosine residues (15Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and it is likely that PSK precursor protein is sulfated by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase as the protein is processed through the Golgi network (19Hanai H. Nakayama D. Yang H. Matsubayashi Y. Hirota Y. Sakagami Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) before secretion. Specific subtilisin serine proteases in the apoplast cleave PSK precursor protein at dibasic residues upstream from the PSK sequence (20Srivastava R. Liu J.X. Howell S.H. Plant J. 2008; 56: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) before further processing to the active pentapeptide. Like other secreted peptide signaling molecules in plants, PSK acts in a paracrine or autocrine fashion on nearby cells expressing the receptor (21Wheeler J.I. Irving H.R. Funct. Plant Biol. 2010; 37: 382-394Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This is most clearly shown in roots, where PSK enhances root elongation by controlling cell size (13Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Kihara H. Niwa M. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Kutschmar A. Rzewuski G. Stührwohldt N. Beemster G.T. Inzé D. Sauter M. New Phytol. 2009; 181: 820-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PSKs also have a role in attenuating expression of stress response genes during differentiation of tracheary elements (23Motose H. Iwamoto K. Endo S. Demura T. Sakagami Y. Matsubayashi Y. Moore K.L. Fukuda H. Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The signaling processes activated by PSK-α binding to PSKR have not been resolved, although it is speculated that the receptor kinase is activated to stimulate a phosphorylation cascade. Because we had identified a putative GC catalytic center in PSKR, we hypothesized that this worked in conjunction with the kinase to signal downstream events. Here we show that the kinase domain of AtPSKR1 has kinase and also GC activity in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate that PSK-α itself induces small and rapid increases in cGMP levels and that overexpression of AtPSKR1 in protoplasts raises endogenous basal cGMP levels. Together these results indicate that AtPSKR1 contains dual functioning GC and kinase catalytic activity that operates in vivo and represents a novel class of kinases with overlapping catalytic domains. The AtPSKR1-KD1 encoding the cytoplasmic domain of AtPSKR1 (AT2G02220) was prepared using cDNA synthesized from RNA freshly isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (Col) as a template with the gene-specific primers AtPskR1-F and AtPskR1-R (supplemental Table 1). The PCR product was cloned into pTOPO and confirmed by sequencing. The AtPSKR1-KD3 (wild type and mutant) constructs were prepared from AtPSKR1-KD1 and cloned into pET SUMO. The mutant (glycine to lysine) was generated using the Expand High Fidelity system (Roche Applied Science), where amplimers A and B were generated to contain the mutation at the catalytic site using the primers AtPskR1-F and amplimer A-rev or amplimer B-for and AtPskR1-Rns (supplemental Table 1), respectively. Amplimer A and B were used as the template in another PCR reaction that contained AtPskR1-F and AtPskR1-Rns as primers to create the mutant construct cloned into pET SUMO. Gateway cloning was used to prepare full-length receptor and cytoplasmic domain (AtPSKR1-KD2) constructs of the AtPSKR1 (AT2G02220) gene. Because AtPSKR1 is intronless, genomic DNA was used as the source material and amplified with KAPA HiFi DNA polymerase (Kapa Biosystems). Primers AtPSKR1-fwd and AtPSKR1-rev (supplemental Table 1) were used to amplify the gene, and then nested gateway primers (AtPSKR1-f-fwd-gw or AtPSKR1-cd-fwd-gw with AtPSKR1-rev-gw-stop) were used to amplify AtPSKR1 full-length and cytoplasmic domain fragments and constructs cloned into pDONR207. The cytoplasmic domain of AtPSKR1 was recombined into pDEST17 (Invitrogen) and used to prepare recombinant protein (pDEST-PSKR1-KD2). The full-length receptor was cloned into the high copy number destination vector p2GW7.0 (24Karimi M. Inzé D. Depicker A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 193-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar) and used in transient transfection studies (p2GW7.0-PSKR1-fl-s). For expression of the recombinant AtPSKR1-KD1 and AtPSKR1-KD3 proteins (wild type or mutant), the appropriate constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) and induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) and grown for a further 3 h at 37 °C. The recombinant protein(s) was purified by preparing a cleared cell lysate under denaturing conditions essentially as described in Protocols 10 and 17 of the QIAexpressionist manual (Qiagen) but with some slight modifications described in the supplemental methods. The eluted protein was subsequently desalted and concentrated using Centriplus filtration devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with a molecular mass cut-off point of 3000 Da. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) before the recombinant protein was stored at −20 °C. The AtPSKR1-KD2 (pDEST-PSKR1-KD2) was transformed into BL21-A1 cells (Invitrogen), and AtPSKR1-KD2 protein expression was induced by 0.2% arabinose for 3 h or with both 0.2% arabinose and 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as the vector contains an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible promoter and the host cells contain an arabinose-inducible promoter. Soluble proteins were purified under native conditions on a nickel column following Protocol 12 in the QIAexpressionist manual (Qiagen) in the presence of 1 mm PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 45 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was concentrated using Centriplus filtration columns (3000 molecular mass cut-off point) by centrifugation (2 h at 4300 × g at 5 °C) and desalted with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF) at 4300 × g for 60 min at 5 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a Quant-iTTM protein assay kit (Invitrogen) in a Qubit® fluorometer (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen), and RNA was digested with DNase I (Ambion) for 1 h at 37 °C. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT)15 primers according to the manufacturer's specifications in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR reaction mixtures contained 1 μl of cDNA (or negative RT reaction), 1× PCR coral load buffer (Qiagen), 0.1 μm primers, 200 μm dNTPs, and 0.2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) per 20-μl reaction. The primers used are described in supplemental Table 1, and the product from the amplification for AtPSKR1 is expected to be 220 bp. All tubes were denatured at 94 °C for 3 min, and then 35 cycles of amplification were performed (60 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 60 s of annealing at 52 °C, and 60 s of extension at 72 °C) with a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min in a MyCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The quality of cDNA produced was assessed by amplifying cDNA for the UBQ-10 gene (expected product: 122 bp), which is a suitable reference gene as it is expressed relatively stably (26Czechowski T. Stitt M. Altmann T. Udvardi M.K. Scheible W.R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). After PCR amplification, equal volumes of PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. The GC activity of AtPSKR1-KD(1–3) was measured in vitro by incubating 2–10 μg of protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 5 mm MgCl2 or 5 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm GTP in a final volume of 100 μl (27Thorpe D.S. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14717-14720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residual cGMP levels resulting from non-GC activity were measured in tubes that contained the incubation medium, but no protein was added. Incubations were performed for 5, 15, and 20 min at room temperature (∼24 °C) and terminated by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. Tubes were then boiled for 3 min, cooled on ice for 2 min, and centrifuged at 2300 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was kept to assay cGMP content. Cyclic GMP was also measured in protoplasts isolated from A. thaliana leaves and treated with PSK-α or non-sulfated PSK (see below). In other cases, protoplasts were transiently transfected as described (28Yoo S.D. Cho Y.H. Sheen J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar) with empty vector (p2GW7.0) or full-length AtPSKR1 (p2GW7.0-PSKR1-fl-s) and incubated for at least 2 h to express protein. Immediately following treatments, protoplasts were placed in liquid nitrogen to stop any further reactions and stored at −80 °C. The cGMP content from recombinant protein and protoplast assays was analyzed using the Amersham Biosciences cGMP enzyme immunoassay Biotrak system following the standard (Protocol 2) or the total cellular cGMP (Protocol 4) acetylation protocols as described in the supplier's manual (GE Healthcare, code RPN226). The optical density was read at 450 nm using an Envision 2101 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cyclic GMP levels were then calculated as fmol/μg of protein or fmol/105 protoplasts. The anti-cGMP antibody is highly specific for cGMP and has ∼106 times lower affinity for cAMP. All assays in the described experiments were carried out in triplicate independent and representative experiments. Mass spectrometry using a Waters API Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Waters Microsep, Johannesburg, South Africa) in the W-mode was used to validate results obtained with the enzyme immunoassay by measuring cGMP levels generated in vitro by recombinant AtPSKR1-KD1. Recombinant protein (10 μg) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 5 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm GTP for 20 min at room temperature (24 °C). Samples were introduced with a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters Microsep) at a flow rate of 180 μl min−1, and separation was achieved by a Phenomenex Synergi (Torrance, CA) 4-μm Fusion-RP (250 × 2.0 mm) column. A gradient of solvent A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid) and solvent B (100% (v/v) acetonitrile) over 18 min was applied. During the first 7 min, the solvent composition was kept at 100% (v/v) (solvent A) followed by a linear gradient of 3 min to 80% (v/v) (solvent B) and re-equilibration to the initial conditions. Electrospray ionization in the negative mode was used at a cone voltage of 35 V. Mass spectrometry was also used to assess substrate specificity of AtPSKR1-GC for GTP, where 1 mm ATP was used as an alternative substrate. The resultant cAMP levels generated from this reaction system were analyzed by the Waters API Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer as described for the cGMP levels. The sulfated PSK-α was synthesized by solid phase synthesis using FmocTyr(SO3Na)OH (where Fmoc is N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) as described (29Kitagawa K. Aida C. Fujiwara H. Yagami T. Futaki S. Kogire M. Ida J. Inoue K. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), non-sulfated PSK (nPSK) was synthesized as outlined (30Matsubayashi Y. Hanai H. Hara O. Sakagami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the products were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Synthesized phytosulfokines were used in protoplast assays. A. thaliana (Col-0) plants were grown, and leaves from 5–6-week-old plants were used to prepare protoplasts as described previously (31Wang Y.H. Gehring C. Cahill D.M. Irving H.R. Funct. Plant Biol. 2007; 34: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated protoplasts (2.5 × 105/treatment) were used directly or in some instances pretreated for 45 min with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor dipyridamole (100 μm) before a 15-min treatment with PSK-α or nPSK and then placed in liquid nitrogen to stop any further reactions and stored at −80 °C before measuring cGMP production. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). The serine/threonine kinase activity of the full cytoplasmic domain of the AtPSKR was measured using the fluorescent Omnia® kinase assay (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, where phosphorylation is detected as an increase in fluorescence of the Sox fluorophore (32Shults M.D. Imperiali B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14248-14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The Ser/Thr peptide 1 (Invitrogen catalogue number KNZ1011) was used as a substrate, and the reaction mix contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, and 1 μg of recombinant kinase in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were set up in white FluoroNunc Maxisorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and fluorescence was measured with an Envision 2101 plate reader (PerkinElmer, Melbourne, Australia) with excitation at 405 nm and emission at 492 nm. Experiments were undertaken in triplicate. The domain organization of PSKR1 is typical of LRR RLKs with a highly conserved leucine-rich repeat domain in the extracellular space, a transmembrane domain, and a kinase domain that forms the majority of the intracellular protein. Unusually, a putative GC catalytic center is also found in the latter part of the kinase domain just downstream of the key kinase catalytic residues and the predicted activation loop (Fig. 1D). To test whether the putative GC domain was functional, we first prepared a construct that contained the complete cytoplasmic domain of PSKR amino acids 683–1008 in pTOPO, which we called AtPSKR1-KD1. We expressed AtPSKR1-KD1 in BL21 (DE3) cells and purified the recombinant protein. We assessed the ability of AtPSKR1-KD1 to generate cGMP using mass spectrometry as we had previously shown that Q-TOF mass spectrometry detected fmol amounts of cGMP (8Kwezi L. Meier S. Mungur L. Ruzvidzo O. Irving H. Gehring C. PLoS one. 2007; 2: e449Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Meier S. Ruzvidzo O. Morse M. Donaldson L. Kwezi L. Gehring C. PLoS one. 2010; 5: e8904Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recombinant AtPSKR1-KD1 catalyzed the production of cGMP (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we undertook a series of tests to determine whether AtPSKR1 also functioned as an adenylate cyclase. No cAMP production was detected (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that AtPSKR1-KD1 acts as a GC only. To test whether the kinase and GC domain were both functional, we prepared another construct that contained the cytoplasmic part of AtPSKR1 in pDEST17 named AtPSKR1-KD2, which included the kinase domain but was 3 amino acids shorter than AtPSKR1-KD1 at the N terminus of the kinase domain (Fig. 1D). The recombinant protein was expressed in BL21-AI cells as an N-terminal His tag protein with a predicted molecular mass of 38.9 kDa and used in both GC and phosphorylation in vitro studies. Firstly, we demonstrated that AtPSKR1-KD2 also exhibited GC activity that showed no preference in metal ion selectivity between Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions; however, the presence of one or the other metal ions was essential to observe activity (Fig. 2B). In a second set of experiments, we used a separately prepared construct in pET SUMO that was 3 amino acids longer than AtPSKR1-KD2 with a kinase domain identical to AtPSKR2-KD1 and termed At-PSKR1-KD3. The recombinant protein was expressed as a His-tagged SUMO fusion protein in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells and has a predicted molecular mass of 50.3 kDa. To test whether the GC search motif present was essential for the observed GC activity, we mutated the glycine residue in position 3 of the search motif to a lysine residue (Fig. 1D) as the glycine is predicted to face the purine and determine substrate specificity for GTP rather than ATP (33Schaap P. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1485-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The recombinant AtPSKR1-KD3 mutant protein exhibited reduced ability to generate cGMP (Fig. 2C), indicating that the glycine residue is necessary for this function. Using the Omnia kinase assay, we also showed that AtPSKR1-KD2 has serine/threonine kinase activity using the Ser/Thr peptide 1 as a substrate. Under these conditions, AtPSKR1-KD2 has an approximate Km of ∼7.5 μm and a Vmax of ∼1800 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein (supplemental Fig. 2 and Fig. 3A). To our knowledge, this is the first reported kinetic value for AtPSKR1 kinase activity, and it is similar to the Km values reported for WAKL10-KD using the same substrate (10Meier S. Ruzvidzo O. Morse M. Donaldson L. Kwezi L. Gehring C. PLoS one. 2010; 5: e8904Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, AtPSKR1-KD2 can use GTP as an alternative substrate to ATP to phosphorylate Ser/Thr peptide 1 (Fig. 3B). Because the AtPSKR1-KD2 also produced cGMP (Fig. 2B), we tested the effects of cGMP on its kinase activity and show that cGMP suppresses kinase activity (Fig. 3C). If the GC activity observed in vitro for AtPSKR1 has a biological role in general and a signaling function in particular, then we might expect to observe it in vivo. To test this possibility, we isolated protoplasts from Arabidopsis leaves, transfected them, and transiently expressed the full-length AtPSKR1 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to overexpress the receptor. The protoplasts were then incubated for at least 2 h to allow expression of the protein before they were harvested. The protoplasts expressing the full-length receptor contained markedly higher basal levels of cGMP than protoplasts transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 4A). Because strong overexpression of AtPSKR1 resulted in increased cGMP levels, it suggested that PSK-α may stimulate AtPSKR1 GC activity as part of its signaling cascade. Protoplasts have been suggested as an ideal tissue to carry out investigations into the roles of cyclic nucleotide signaling as they can respond rapidly to extracellular signals (36Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Firstly, we determined that young Arabidopsis leaves and our protoplast preparations were expressing AtPSKR1 RNA (Fig. 4B) and so could conceivably respond to PSK-α treatment by inducing cGMP production. We prepared PSK-α and the relatively inactive nPSK to test whether these peptides could induce cGMP production in protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis leaves. In the presence of PSK-α but not nPSK, cGMP levels were raised in protoplasts. This increase in cGMP levels was measured in the absence of any phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Fig. 4C). The inhibitor dipyridamole has been used successfully in plants to decrease basal phosphodiesterase activity (37Szmidt-Jaworska A. Jaworski K. Kopcewicz J. J. Plant Physiol. 2008; 165: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and when it was present, we observed a 3-fold increase in cGMP levels over control and nPSK treatment (Fig. 4D). The levels of cGMP detected in the protoplasts are in the normal range reported for plants (e.g. (31Wang Y.H. Gehring C. Cahill D.M. Irving H.R. Funct.

https://openalex.org/W2005999729,"HMGCS2 (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase 2), the gene that regulates ketone body production, is barely expressed in cultured cell lines. In this study, we restored HMGCS2 expression and activity in HepG2 cells, thus showing that the wild type enzyme can induce fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant C166A did not generate either process. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α expression also induces fatty acid β-oxidation and endogenous HMGCS2 expression. Interestingly, PPARα-mediated induction was abolished when HMGCS2 expression was down-regulated by RNAi. These results indicate that HMGCS2 expression is both sufficient and necessary to the control of fatty acid oxidation in these cells. Next, we examined the expression pattern of several PPARα target genes in this now “ketogenic” HepG2 cell line. FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) expression was specifically induced by HMGCS2 activity or by the inclusion of the oxidized form of ketone bodies (acetoacetate) in the culture medium. This effect was blunted by SirT1 (sirtuin 1) RNAi, so we propose a SirT1-dependent mechanism for FGF21 induction by acetoacetate. These data suggest a novel feed-forward mechanism by which HMGCS2 could regulate adaptive metabolic responses during fasting. This mechanism could be physiologically relevant, because fasting-mediated induction of liver FGF21 was dependent on SirT1 activity in vivo.

These data suggest a novel feed-forward mechanism by which HMGCS2 could regulate adaptive metabolic responses during fasting. This mechanism could be physiologically relevant, because fasting-mediated induction of liver FGF21 was dependent on SirT1 activity in vivo. IntroductionThe liver plays a central role in the adaptive response to fasting. The plasma hormone profile in this situation, low insulin and high glucagon, induces the release of large amounts of fatty acids from the adipose tissue to be used by peripheral tissues to spare glucose consumption. Therefore, the liver of a starved animal actively oxidizes fatty acid, which provides the energy necessary to sustain gluconeogenesis. It also supplies the acetyl-CoA needed for active ketone body synthesis, which replaces glucose as the energy substrate for the brain and other tissues (1McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar).Two enzymes determine the metabolic fate of fatty acids in the liver of starved animals: carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) A (EC 2.3.1.21) and hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) (EC 4.1.3.5). CPT1A encodes a malonyl-CoA-sensitive protein that regulates mitochondrial long chain fatty acid oxidation (1McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), whereas HMGCS2 encodes a mitochondrial protein that controls the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) 5The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA3-HB3-hydroxybutyrateAcAcacetoacetate. cycle, by which acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and NAD+ are generated (2Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The expression of both genes is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (3Napal L. Marrero P.F.

Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Another gene directly regulated by PPARα in liver is FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21), a signaling molecule induced in the ketotic state (8Inagaki T. Dutchak P. Zhao G. Ding X. Gautron L. Parameswara V. Li Y. Goetz R. Mohammadi M. Esser V. Elmquist J.K. Gerard R.D. Burgess S.C. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A.

Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The hypoglycemia is due to a reduced capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis secondary to a 70% lower rate of fatty acid oxidation (10Le May C. Pineau T. Bigot K. Kohl C. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the decrease in fatty acid oxidation is not due to inappropriate expression of hepatic CPT1A, which is similar in both genotypes, but to impaired HMGCS2 expression in the PPARα null mouse liver (10Le May C. Pineau T. Bigot K. Kohl C. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that HMGCS2 interacts with PPARα and acts as a co-activator to up-regulate transcription from the PPRE of its own gene (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The HMGCS2-PPARα interaction is enhanced by HMGCS2 palmitoylation (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), underlying a putative mechanism by which PPARα is activated by one of its target gene products when fatty acids are available. However, this is a specific mechanism for HMGCS2, because other PPARα target genes are not co-activated by HMGCS2 expression (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In addition to this network of genes regulated by PPARα activation, another enzyme may contribute to the metabolic adaptation to fasting: SirT1 (sirtuin 1). This NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase is a general regulator of energy homeostasis in response to nutrient availability (13Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Hepatic deletion of SIRT1 alters PPARα signaling, especially the induction of FGF21 mRNA by PPARα ligands (14Purushotham A. Schug T.T. Xu Q. Surapureddi S. Guo X. Li X. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar).A common feature in hepatoma cell lines is the low capacity for long chain fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production, which correlates with low expression of HMGCS2 (15Prip-Buus C. Bouthillier-Voisin A.C. Kohl C. Demaugre F. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PPARα in HepG2 cell can restore the expression of this and other genes, and it induces fatty acid β-oxidation (6Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27950-27958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether PPARα-mediated expression of HMGCS2 acts as co-activator of this process.In this paper we show that, in HepG2 cells, wild type human HMGCS2 expression induces both fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Using shRNAs, we also show that HMGCS2 expression is necessary for PPARα-mediated induction of fatty acid oxidation. In addition, we show that HMGCS2 expression stimulates FGF21 expression. We also report that FGF21 is induced by starvation by a mechanism involving SirT1 activity. Finally, we show that these events are dependent on HMGCS2 activity, because a catalytic dead mutant (C166A) failed to induce either fatty acid β-oxidation or FGF21 expression, whereas acetoacetate (an oxidized form of ketone bodies) can stimulate FGF21 mRNA induction by a SirT1-dependent mechanism. We propose a feed-forward model in which ketogenesis activates a SirT1-mediated response and long chain fatty acid oxidation.DISCUSSIONFatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis are induced during fasting or lactation (1McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and also in pathological situations such as diabetes (reviewed in Ref. 29Eledrisi M.S. Alshanti M.S. Shah M.F. Brolosy B. Jaha N. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2006; 331: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PPARα mediates the induction of genes responsible for controlling both processes. The HMGCS2 gene controls ketogenesis (2Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and is a PPARα target (4Rodríguez J.C. Gil-Gómez G. Hegardt F.G. Haro D. J. Biol.

Therefore, in this paper, we generated two adenoviruses expressing wild type and a catalytically inactive mutant (C166A; Fig. 1A) of the human HMGCS2. When HMGCS2 activity was expressed, HepG2 cells become ketogenic (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we also observed that these cells had a greater capacity to oxidize long chain fatty acids. The β-oxidation induction was similar to that seen in PPARα-infected cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that expression of the gene not only controls ketogenesis but can also control the β-oxidation pathway in certain circumstances.Recombinant PPARα expression in HepG2 cells induces β-oxidation of fatty acids and the expression of genes such as FGF21, HMGCS2, and CPT1A (Ref. 6Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27950-27958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and Table 1). It has been proposed that HMGCS2 is a co-activator of PPARα (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) through a mechanism involving the HMGCS2 palmitoylation of Cys-166 (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, we found that expression of HMGCS2 was involved in the induction of fatty acid oxidation mediated by PPARα (Fig. 2). However, our data do not support the role of HMGCS2 as a PPARα co-activator. We did not observe an interaction between PPARα and HMGCS2 nor a nuclear co-localization of both proteins (Fig. 4). In addition, no effect of co-activation was observed at the level of reporter gene even for HMGCS2, which was proposed (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as the target of PPARα co-activation (data not shown). Therefore, we have sought an alternative hypothesis to explain the role of HMGCS2 in controlling fatty acid oxidation.Liver synthesizes acetoacetate through the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) cycle, which is driven by the three mitochondrial located enzymes acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2; EC 4.1.3.5), and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4) and produces 1 mol of acetoacetate, 1 mol of acetyl-CoA, and 2 mol of free CoA from three molecules of acetyl-CoA (2Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Acetoacetate is further reduced to β-hydroxybutyrate through mitochondrial β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30), driven by high levels of NADH in hepatic mitochondria. Interestingly, in humans (30Guo K. Lukacik P. Papagrigoriou E. Meier M. Lee W.H. Adamski J. Oppermann U. J. Biol.

J. 1970; 119: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a cytosolic isotype of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase has been characterized, suggesting a reversible conversion between acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate depending on the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio. In addition, diet manipulation, like caloric restriction, affects the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio in liver and muscle (18Chen D. Bruno J. Easlon E. Lin S.J. Cheng H.L. Alt F.W. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In this study we hypothesized that HMGCS2, widely expressed in human tissues (16Mascaró C. Buesa C. Ortiz J.A. Haro D. Hegardt F.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), could modulate [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio by feed-forward ketogenesis. HMGCS2 activity specifically induces FGF21 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas other PPARα target genes remained unaffected (Table 1). Also, knockdown of HMGCS2 clearly affected FGF21 expression and its induction by PPARα (Fig. 3B). FGF21 has been shown to be highly sensitive to SirT1 activity on ligand-dependent PPARα transactivation (14Purushotham A. Schug T.T. Xu Q. Surapureddi S. Guo X. Li X. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and our data clearly indicate that fasting-induced expression of FGF21 was blunted in SirT1 liver-specific knock-out, whereas other PPARα target genes were unaffected in this experimental condition (Fig. 5). This result indicates that FGF21, in terms of mRNA levels or the circulating protein, is highly sensitive to SirT1 activity during fasting.To explain our data, we propose that under certain circumstances HMGCS2 activity, through acetoacetate generation, could modulate the cytosolic [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio and therefore SirT1 activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the addition of acetoacetate, but not β-hydroxybutyrate, to the HepG2 cell medium induces FGF21 expression in a mechanism dependent on SirT1 (Fig. 6). Therefore, HMGCS2 seems to have a specific effect on gene expression, which does not depend on PPARα co-activation. However, our results do not fully explain why HMGCS2 expression is necessary for the induction of β-oxidation mediated by PPARα. It is possible that changes in the mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio are also partly responsible for this phenomenon. However, it is also possible that removal of acetyl-CoA, as acetoacetate, accelerates the catabolic process and that both FGF21 mRNA expression and β-oxidation are stimulated by HMGCS2 through independent mechanisms.Proliferating cells do not express HMGCS2 activity (10Le May C.

The human gene is a target of c-Myc, and its expression is characteristic of differentiated cells of the colon (24Camarero N. Mascaró C. Mayordomo C. Vilardell F. Haro D. Marrero P.F. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The role of oxidative metabolism in cell transformation has recently been highlighted (reviewed in Ref. 32DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been found that p53 up-regulates fatty acid oxidation induced by glucose starvation (33Ide T. Brown-Endres L. Chu K. Ongusaha P.P. Ohtsuka T. El-Deiry W.S. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 379-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and it is proposed that this effect would be part of its role as a tumor suppressor gene because active β-oxidation would protect the cell from Warburg effect (reviewed in Ref. 34Levine A.J. Puzio-Kuter A.M. Science. 2010; 330: 1340-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). We have not observed a clear effect of HMGCS2 gene expression on cell proliferation, a target gene of p53 (data not shown). However, we have shown how HMGCS2 expression produces metabolic effects capable of inducing the expression of genes such as FGF21 and altering the oxidative flux of long chain fatty acids.In conclusion, our results suggest that HMGCS2 expression affects the PPARα-mediated response. However, we propose an alternative mechanism to the previously proposed co-activation of PPARα (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our mechanism would be related to changes in the metabolites of the cell induced by the acceleration of ketogenesis, although these changes could be related to factors other than SirT1 activity. IntroductionThe liver plays a central role in the adaptive response to fasting. The plasma hormone profile in this situation, low insulin and high glucagon, induces the release of large amounts of fatty acids from the adipose tissue to be used by peripheral tissues to spare glucose consumption. Therefore, the liver of a starved animal actively oxidizes fatty acid, which provides the energy necessary to sustain gluconeogenesis. It also supplies the acetyl-CoA needed for active ketone body synthesis, which replaces glucose as the energy substrate for the brain and other tissues (1McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar).Two enzymes determine the metabolic fate of fatty acids in the liver of starved animals: carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) A (EC 2.3.1.21) and hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) (EC 4.1.3.5). CPT1A encodes a malonyl-CoA-sensitive protein that regulates mitochondrial long chain fatty acid oxidation (1McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), whereas HMGCS2 encodes a mitochondrial protein that controls the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) 5The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA3-HB3-hydroxybutyrateAcAcacetoacetate. cycle, by which acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and NAD+ are generated (2Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The expression of both genes is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (3Napal L. Marrero P.F.

Another gene directly regulated by PPARα in liver is FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21), a signaling molecule induced in the ketotic state (8Inagaki T. Dutchak P. Zhao G. Ding X. Gautron L. Parameswara V. Li Y. Goetz R. Mohammadi M. Esser V. Elmquist J.K. Gerard R.D. Burgess S.C. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A.

Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The hypoglycemia is due to a reduced capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis secondary to a 70% lower rate of fatty acid oxidation (10Le May C. Pineau T. Bigot K. Kohl C. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the decrease in fatty acid oxidation is not due to inappropriate expression of hepatic CPT1A, which is similar in both genotypes, but to impaired HMGCS2 expression in the PPARα null mouse liver (10Le May C. Pineau T. Bigot K. Kohl C. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that HMGCS2 interacts with PPARα and acts as a co-activator to up-regulate transcription from the PPRE of its own gene (11Meertens L.M.

FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The HMGCS2-PPARα interaction is enhanced by HMGCS2 palmitoylation (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), underlying a putative mechanism by which PPARα is activated by one of its target gene products when fatty acids are available. However, this is a specific mechanism for HMGCS2, because other PPARα target genes are not co-activated by HMGCS2 expression (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In addition to this network of genes regulated by PPARα activation, another enzyme may contribute to the metabolic adaptation to fasting: SirT1 (sirtuin 1). This NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase is a general regulator of energy homeostasis in response to nutrient availability (13Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Hepatic deletion of SIRT1 alters PPARα signaling, especially the induction of FGF21 mRNA by PPARα ligands (14Purushotham A. Schug T.T. Xu Q. Surapureddi S. Guo X. Li X. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar).A common feature in hepatoma cell lines is the low capacity for long chain fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production, which correlates with low expression of HMGCS2 (15Prip-Buus C. Bouthillier-Voisin A.C. Kohl C. Demaugre F. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PPARα in HepG2 cell can restore the expression of this and other genes, and it induces fatty acid β-oxidation (6Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27950-27958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether PPARα-mediated expression of HMGCS2 acts as co-activator of this process.In this paper we show that, in HepG2 cells, wild type human HMGCS2 expression induces both fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Using shRNAs, we also show that HMGCS2 expression is necessary for PPARα-mediated induction of fatty acid oxidation. In addition, we show that HMGCS2 expression stimulates FGF21 expression. We also report that FGF21 is induced by starvation by a mechanism involving SirT1 activity. Finally, we show that these events are dependent on HMGCS2 activity, because a catalytic dead mutant (C166A) failed to induce either fatty acid β-oxidation or FGF21 expression, whereas acetoacetate (an oxidized form of ketone bodies) can stimulate FGF21 mRNA induction by a SirT1-dependent mechanism. We propose a feed-forward model in which ketogenesis activates a SirT1-mediated response and long chain fatty acid oxidation. The liver plays a central role in the adaptive response to fasting. The plasma hormone profile in this situation, low insulin and high glucagon, induces the release of large amounts of fatty acids from the adipose tissue to be used by peripheral tissues to spare glucose consumption.

Therefore, in this paper, we generated two adenoviruses expressing wild type and a catalytically inactive mutant (C166A; Fig. 1A) of the human HMGCS2. When HMGCS2 activity was expressed, HepG2 cells become ketogenic (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we also observed that these cells had a greater capacity to oxidize long chain fatty acids. The β-oxidation induction was similar to that seen in PPARα-infected cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that expression of the gene not only controls ketogenesis but can also control the β-oxidation pathway in certain circumstances.Recombinant PPARα expression in HepG2 cells induces β-oxidation of fatty acids and the expression of genes such as FGF21, HMGCS2, and CPT1A (Ref. 6Hsu M.H.

It has been proposed that HMGCS2 is a co-activator of PPARα (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) through a mechanism involving the HMGCS2 palmitoylation of Cys-166 (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, we found that expression of HMGCS2 was involved in the induction of fatty acid oxidation mediated by PPARα (Fig. 2). However, our data do not support the role of HMGCS2 as a PPARα co-activator. We did not observe an interaction between PPARα and HMGCS2 nor a nuclear co-localization of both proteins (Fig. 4). In addition, no effect of co-activation was observed at the level of reporter gene even for HMGCS2, which was proposed (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as the target of PPARα co-activation (data not shown). Therefore, we have sought an alternative hypothesis to explain the role of HMGCS2 in controlling fatty acid oxidation.Liver synthesizes acetoacetate through the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) cycle, which is driven by the three mitochondrial located enzymes acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2; EC 4.1.3.5), and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4) and produces 1 mol of acetoacetate, 1 mol of acetyl-CoA, and 2 mol of free CoA from three molecules of acetyl-CoA (2Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Acetoacetate is further reduced to β-hydroxybutyrate through mitochondrial β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30), driven by high levels of NADH in hepatic mitochondria. Interestingly, in humans (30Guo K. Lukacik P. Papagrigoriou E. Meier M. Lee W.H. Adamski J. Oppermann U. J. Biol.

J. 1970; 119: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a cytosolic isotype of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase has been characterized, suggesting a reversible conversion between acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate depending on the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio. In addition, diet manipulation, like caloric restriction, affects the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio in liver and muscle (18Chen D. Bruno J. Easlon E. Lin S.J. Cheng H.L. Alt F.W. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In this study we hypothesized that HMGCS2, widely expressed in human tissues (16Mascaró C. Buesa C. Ortiz J.A. Haro D. Hegardt F.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), could modulate [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio by feed-forward ketogenesis. HMGCS2 activity specifically induces FGF21 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas other PPARα target genes remained unaffected (Table 1). Also, knockdown of HMGCS2 clearly affected FGF21 expression and its induction by PPARα (Fig. 3B). FGF21 has been shown to be highly sensitive to SirT1 activity on ligand-dependent PPARα transactivation (14Purushotham A. Schug T.T. Xu Q. Surapureddi S. Guo X. Li X. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and our data clearly indicate that fasting-induced expression of FGF21 was blunted in SirT1 liver-specific knock-out, whereas other PPARα target genes were unaffected in this experimental condition (Fig. 5). This result indicates that FGF21, in terms of mRNA levels or the circulating protein, is highly sensitive to SirT1 activity during fasting.To explain our data, we propose that under certain circumstances HMGCS2 activity, through acetoacetate generation, could modulate the cytosolic [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio and therefore SirT1 activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the addition of acetoacetate, but not β-hydroxybutyrate, to the HepG2 cell medium induces FGF21 expression in a mechanism dependent on SirT1 (Fig. 6). Therefore, HMGCS2 seems to have a specific effect on gene expression, which does not depend on PPARα co-activation. However, our results do not fully explain why HMGCS2 expression is necessary for the induction of β-oxidation mediated by PPARα. It is possible that changes in the mitochondrial [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio are also partly responsible for this phenomenon. However, it is also possible that removal of acetyl-CoA, as acetoacetate, accelerates the catabolic process and that both FGF21 mRNA expression and β-oxidation are stimulated by HMGCS2 through independent mechanisms.Proliferating cells do not express HMGCS2 activity (10Le May C.

The human gene is a target of c-Myc, and its expression is characteristic of differentiated cells of the colon (24Camarero N. Mascaró C. Mayordomo C. Vilardell F. Haro D. Marrero P.F. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The role of oxidative metabolism in cell transformation has recently been highlighted (reviewed in Ref. 32DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been found that p53 up-regulates fatty acid oxidation induced by glucose starvation (33Ide T. Brown-Endres L. Chu K. Ongusaha P.P. Ohtsuka T. El-Deiry W.S. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Mol.

Puzio-Kuter A.M. Science. 2010; 330: 1340-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). We have not observed a clear effect of HMGCS2 gene expression on cell proliferation, a target gene of p53 (data not shown). However, we have shown how HMGCS2 expression produces metabolic effects capable of inducing the expression of genes such as FGF21 and altering the oxidative flux of long chain fatty acids.In conclusion, our results suggest that HMGCS2 expression affects the PPARα-mediated response. However, we propose an alternative mechanism to the previously proposed co-activation of PPARα (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P.

Our mechanism would be related to changes in the metabolites of the cell induced by the acceleration of ketogenesis, although these changes could be related to factors other than SirT1 activity. Fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis are induced during fasting or lactation (1McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev.

Therefore, in this paper, we generated two adenoviruses expressing wild type and a catalytically inactive mutant (C166A; Fig. 1A) of the human HMGCS2. When HMGCS2 activity was expressed, HepG2 cells become ketogenic (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we also observed that these cells had a greater capacity to oxidize long chain fatty acids. The β-oxidation induction was similar to that seen in PPARα-infected cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that expression of the gene not only controls ketogenesis but can also control the β-oxidation pathway in certain circumstances. Recombinant PPARα expression in HepG2 cells induces β-oxidation of fatty acids and the expression of genes such as FGF21, HMGCS2, and CPT1A (Ref. 6Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27950-27958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and Table 1). It has been proposed that HMGCS2 is a co-activator of PPARα (11Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) through a mechanism involving the HMGCS2 palmitoylation of Cys-166 (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, we found that expression of HMGCS2 was involved in the induction of fatty acid oxidation mediated by PPARα (Fig. 2). However, our data do not support the role of HMGCS2 as a PPARα co-activator. We did not observe an interaction between PPARα and HMGCS2 nor a nuclear co-localization of both proteins (Fig. 4). In addition, no effect of co-activation was observed at the level of reporter gene even for HMGCS2, which was proposed (12Kostiuk M.A. Keller B.O. Berthiaume L.G. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1914-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as the target of PPARα co-activation (data not shown). Therefore, we have sought an alternative hypothesis to explain the role of HMGCS2 in controlling fatty acid oxidation. Liver synthesizes acetoacetate through the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) cycle, which is driven by the three mitochondrial located enzymes acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2; EC 4.1.3.5), and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4) and produces 1 mol of acetoacetate, 1 mol of acetyl-CoA, and 2 mol of free CoA from three molecules of acetyl-CoA (2Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Acetoacetate is further reduced to β-hydroxybutyrate through mitochondrial β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30), driven by high levels of NADH in hepatic mitochondria. Interestingly, in humans (30Guo K. Lukacik P. Papagrigoriou E. Meier M. Lee W.H. Adamski J. Oppermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10291-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and other mammals (31Koundakjian P.P. Snoswell A.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a cytosolic isotype of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase has been characterized, suggesting a reversible conversion between acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate depending on the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio. In addition, diet manipulation, like caloric restriction, affects the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio in liver and muscle (18Chen D. Bruno J. Easlon E. Lin S.J. Cheng H.L. Alt F.W. Guarente L.

https://openalex.org/W2091434928,"In plant organelles, RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism that converts specific cytidines to uridines in RNA of both mitochondria and plastids, altering the information encoded by the gene. The cytidine to be edited is determined by a cis-element surrounding the editing site that is specifically recognized and bound by a trans-acting factor. All the trans-acting editing factors identified so far in plant organelles are members of a large protein family, the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. We have identified the Organelle Transcript Processing 87 (OTP87) gene, which is required for RNA editing of the nad7-C24 and atp1-C1178 sites in Arabidopsis mitochondria. OTP87 encodes an E-subclass PPR protein with an unusually short E-domain. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli specifically binds to RNAs comprising 30 nucleotides upstream and 10 nucleotides downstream of the nad7-C24 and atp1-C1178 editing sites. The loss-of-function of OTP87 results in small plants with growth and developmental delays. In the otp87 mutant, the amount of assembled respiratory complex V (ATP synthase) is highly reduced compared with the wild type suggesting that the amino acid alteration in ATP1 caused by loss of editing at the atp1-C1178 site affects complex V assembly in mitochondria."

Suitable biomarkers for detection of tumors at an early curable stage would significantly improve patient survival. Here, we show that the SPG20 (spastic paraplegia-20) promoter, encoding the multifunctional Spartin protein, is hypermethylated in 89% of colorectal carcinomas, 78% of adenomas and only 1% of normal mucosa samples. SPG20 methylation was also present in a pilot series of stool samples and corresponding tumors from colorectal cancer patients. SPG20 promoter hypermethylation resulted in loss of mRNA expression in various cancer types and subsequent depletion of Spartin. We further showed that Spartin downregulation in cancer cells resulted in cytokinesis arrest, which was reversed when SPG20 methylation was inhibited. The present study identifies SPG20 promoter hypermethylation as a biomarker suitable for non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer, and a possible mechanism for cytokinesis arrest in colorectal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2110116062,"Epidemiological and experimental evidence indicates that nicotine is protective for Parkinson disease vulnerable dopamine neurons, but the underlying mechanism of this effect remains only partly characterized. To address this question, we established rat midbrain cultures maintained in experimental conditions that favor the selective and spontaneous loss of dopamine neurons. We report here that nicotine afforded neuroprotection to dopamine neurons (EC50 = 0.32 μM) but only in a situation where cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca2+cyt) was slightly and chronically elevated above control levels by concurrent depolarizing treatments. By a pharmacological approach, we demonstrated that the rise in Ca2+ cyt was necessary to sensitize dopamine neurons to the action of nicotine through a mechanism involving α-bungarotoxin-sensitive (presumably α7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and secondarily T-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Confirming the role played by α7 nAChRs in this effect, nicotine had no protective action in midbrain cultures prepared from genetically engineered mice lacking this receptor subtype. Signaling studies revealed that Ca2+ cyt elevations evoked by nicotine and concomitant depolarizing treatments served to activate a survival pathway involving the calcium effector protein calmodulin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Collectively, our data support the idea that the protective action of nicotine for dopamine neurons is activity-dependent and gated by Ca2+cyt.—Toulorge, D., Guerreiro, S., Hild, A., Maskos, U., Hirsch, E.

DUSP6 is a critical regulator of the ERK signaling cascade and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor. We report here experimental evidences that DUSP6 is transcriptionally upregulated in primary and long-term cultures of human glioblastoma, as assayed by northern hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR, producing constitutive high level of protein expression. Functional assays were performed with adenovirus-mediated expression of DUSP6 in glioblastoma cultures. Protein overexpression inhibits growth by inducing G1-phase delay and increased mitogenic/anchorage dependence and clonogenic potential in vitro. Changes in cell morphology were associated with an increased tumor growth in vivo. Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure and poor outcome in human glioblastomas. Importantly, DUSP6 overexpression increased resistance to cisplatin-mediated cell death in vitro and in vivo. Antisense-mediated depletion of DUSP6 acted in lowering the threshold to anticancer DNA-damaging drugs. We conclude that upregulation of DUSP6 exerts a tumor-promoting role in human glioblastomas exacerbating the malignant phenotype."

Although many of its functions are attributable to the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, the AT1AR is known to affect a number of other intracellular pathways through less well defined signal transduction mechanisms. These include transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (1Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F.

The AT1AR plays a pathophysiologic role in several cardiovascular diseases, such as essential hypertension, atherosclerosis, and maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy. Little is known, however, about the role of non-classical AT1R signaling in the genesis of these conditions. The term “functional selectivity” refers to the property of some ligands to selectively couple a GPCR to different effectors, producing a ligand-specific signaling profile that is distinct from that of the native agonist. This phenomenon is hypothesized to result from the ligand-dependent stabilization of receptor conformations that favor coupling to only a subset of all possible downstream effectors. Such “biased” agonists have been described for several GPCRs, among them the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor, δ-opioid receptor, β2 adrenergic receptor, and the AT1AR. The synthetic congener of AngII, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (SII), is an arrestin pathway-selective biased agonist for the AT1AR. SII was originally described as an AT1AR antagonist that possessed the novel property of promoting receptor internalization without activating G-protein signaling (4Holloway A.C. Qian H. Pipolo L. Ziogas J. Miura S. Karnik S. Southwell B.R. Lew M.J. Thomas W.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It was later demonstrated that SII activates ERK1/2 using β-arrestin as a ligand-regulated scaffold for the assembly of an ERK1/2 activation complex (5Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Unlike G-protein-mediated ERK1/2 activation, ERK1/2 activated by SII remains associated with the receptor-arrestin signalsome complex in the cytosol, where it presumably performs distinct functions. This reversal of efficacy, wherein SII behaves as a competitive antagonist of AT1AR-G protein coupling but as an agonist for arrestin-dependent receptor internalization and signaling, defines it as an arrestin pathway-selective biased AT1AR agonist. Not surprisingly, the in vivo efficacy of SII appears to differ from both AngII and conventional AT1AR antagonists. Despite its antagonism of AngII-mediated calcium signaling, SII has been reported to increase cardiomyocyte inotropy and lusotropy (6Rajagopal K. Whalen E.J. Violin J.D. Stiber J.A. Rosenberg P.B.

Although it is now recognized that β-arrestins bind a diverse set of catalytically active proteins, enabling them to recruit protein and lipid kinase, phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and ubiquitin ligase activity into the receptor-arrestin complexes (9Kendall R.T. Luttrell L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2953-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Luttrell L.M. Gesty-Palmer D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 305-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), there is limited information about how these signalsome functions integrate into the broader scope of cellular metabolism. The goal of the present study was to employ SII as a tool to investigate the G-protein-independent AT1AR signal transduction network using gel-based proteomics to identify downstream targets of AT1AR-arrestin signalsomes. Using a limited two-dimensional gel-based phosphoproteomic screen coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectroscopy, we demonstrated that SII stimulates a robust signaling response with surprisingly limited overlap with AngII. We found that two previously unreported SII-induced protein phosphorylation events, phosphorylation of I2PP2A and PGES3, are associated with arrestin-dependent changes in the activity of these proteins and their downstream targets. These results indicate that the AT1AR regulates a robust G-protein-independent signaling network that affects protein phosphorylation and autocrine/paracrine prostaglandin production, and that these pathways can be selectively modulated by biased ligands that induce signalsome formation.

Expression plasmids encoding PGES3 and cyclooxygenase (Cox)1 were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). HEK293 cells stably expressing the HA epitope-tagged AT1AR (HEK-AT1AR) or GFP-tagged AT1AR were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was performed at 50% confluence in 10-cm dishes using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA per dish and 3 μl FuGENE per μg DNA. Proteins were allowed to express for 72 h before the assay. Prior to each experiment, transfected cells were seeded into multi-well plates as appropriate, and monolayers were incubated for 2–24 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and antibiotic/antimycotic. Primary rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells were prepared and cultured as described previously (12Morinelli T.A. Kendall R.T. Luttrell L.M. Walker L.P. Ullian M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2009; 330: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle cells were used between the fifth and eighth passages and were serum-deprived for 72 h before experimentation. Simultaneous silencing of β-arrestin 1 and 2 was performed using 19-nucleotide duplex RNA with 3′ dTdT overhangs. The siRNA sequence was 5′-ACCUGCGCCUUCCGCUAUGTT-3′. The non-silencing RNA duplex 5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCAC GU-3′ was used for the negative control. HEK293 cells at 50% confluence in 10-cm plates were transfected with 20 μg of control or β-arrestin 1/2-targeted siRNA using 50 μl of GeneSilencer transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed 72 h after gene silencing. Silencing of β-arrestin expression was confirmed by immunoblotting whole cell lysates using rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin IgG with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. For experiments requiring both siRNA silencing and transient transfection, the medium was replaced 24 h after siRNA transfection, and cells were transfected with plasmid cDNA encoding PGES3 and/or Cox1 using FuGENE 6. Assays were performed 72 h after FuGENE transfection. Stock solutions (100×) of SII were prepared in 10 mm acetic acid, 154 mm NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The Kd of SII for the AT1AR is ∼0.3 μm compared with 0.1 nm for AngII. To ensure full receptor occupancy, stimulations were performed using SII and AngII at ∼100-fold greater than Kd (50 μm SII and 100 nm AngII). Non-stimulated controls were exposed to vehicle only for the equivalent times. HEK-AT1AR cells were seeded in 96-well clear-bottom black plates at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h before overnight serum starvation. Prior to assay, the cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 2 μm calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester, in Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm probenecid and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and exposed to agonists. Intracellular calcium flux was measured using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR1TM, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Acquired data were analyzed using system software. To visualize AT1AR internalization, HEK293 stably expressing GFP-tagged AT1AR were plated onto collagen-coated 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes, serum-starved overnight, stimulated as described in the figure legends, washed with Hank's balanced salt solution, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63× 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens and 488 nm excitation and 515–540 nm emission filter sets. Five confluent 10-cm plates of HEK-AT1AR cells were used for each sample. Cells were serum-starved for 2 h before a 5-min stimulation with SII, AngII, or vehicle. Monolayers were washed once with ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution and lysed with 0.4 ml/plate ice-cold Pro Q lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture composed of 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm vanadium oxide. The lysates were sonicated, incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing for 1 min every 10 min, clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and then diluted to 10 ml with ice-cold Pro Q Diamond wash buffer. The diluted lysates were applied 1 ml at a time to a washed and equilibrated Pro Q Diamond column containing 1.5 ml resin. The column was washed with 4.5 ml ice-cold wash buffer before elution with 1.75 ml Pro Q Diamond elution buffer. The eluates were concentrated, the buffer was exchanged with 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate buffer, and enriched phosphoproteins were precipitated according to the Pro Q Diamond protocol. Phosphoproteins were resuspended in 60 μl of DIGE buffer (7 M urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 10 mm Tris (pH 7)) plus 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm NaF. Sample protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay, and samples were stored unfrozen at 4 °C until electrophoresis. Enriched phosphoprotein samples were diluted to the desired concentration with DIGE buffer without Tris, supplemented with 0.2% Biolytes (pH 3–10) and 50 mm DTT, and clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. 200 μg/gel of sample proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing using ZOOM® (pH 4–7) strips according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isoelectric focusing strips were equilibrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis buffer and loaded onto 4–20% Tris-glycine ZOOM® gels for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. The two-dimensional gels were stained with the fluorescent phosphoprotein-specific stain Pro Q Diamond according to the manufacturer's protocol. Spot matching and image analysis were performed using PD Quest software. Spots with a 2-fold or greater difference relative to the non-stimulated sample were selected for identification by tandem mass spectrometry. Tryptic peptides were analyzed using a 4800 MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The top 20 ions were selected for MS/MS, and the data were queried in MASCOT (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) against the NCBI mammalian database. The protein modifications that were allowed included phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine; oxidation of methionine; carbamidomethylation of cysteine; acetylation of lysine; and one missed tryptic cleavage. To detect endogenous β-arrestin 2-binding proteins, HEK-AT1AR cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin 2 expression plasmid. 10-cm plates of subconfluent cells were serum-starved for 2 h; stimulated with SII, AngII, or vehicle for 5 min; and lysed with 0.4 ml ice-cold glycerol lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and FLAG-β-arrestin 2 was immunoprecipitated using 30 μl of a 50% slurry of EZ view red M2 anti-FLAG affinity resin with 2 h of tumbling at 4 °C. The affinity resin was washed twice in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer for resolution by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation of I1PP2A, I2PP2A, and PGES3 was performed similarly, using rabbit polyclonal primary IgG and collecting immune complexes on 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-G plus/protein A-agarose. Immunoblots of phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, GAPDH, I2PP2A, and β-arrestin 1/2 were performed using rabbit polyclonal IgG with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Immunoblots of FLAG-epitope, PP2A, I1PP2A, and PGES3 were performed using mouse monoclonal IgG with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Immunoblots of phospho-Ser and phospho-Ser/Thr were performed using HRP-conjugated primary mouse monoclonal IgG. Whole cell and β-arrestin 2-associated PP2A activity was assayed using the Millipore PP2A activity assay kit. For whole cell activity, appropriately stimulated subconfluent 10-cm plates of serum-starved HEK-AT1AR cells were washed in Hank's balanced salt solution, lysed with 500 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 2 mm ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, 2 mm ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated. The PP2A catalytic subunit was immunoprecipitated as described, and phosphatase activity was determined following the kit manufacturer's protocol. β-Arrestin 2-associated PP2A activity was determined by assaying phosphatase activity in FLAG-β-arrestin 2 immunoprecipitates. To confirm the source of FLAG-β-arrestin 2-associated phosphatase activity, some assays were performed in the presence of 2 nm okadaic acid, a specific PP2A inhibitor. Appropriately transfected HEK-AT1AR or primary rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells in 6-well plates were serum starved for 2 h and then exposed to SII, AngII, or vehicle for 30 min in fresh serum starvation media. Prostaglandin synthase activity was determined by measuring PGE2 release into the culture medium using the Cayman prostaglandin E2 monoclonal enzyme-linked immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The AT1AR couples primarily to Gq/11 proteins that stimulate a PLCβ-inositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate pathway, leading to release of calcium from intracellular stores. As shown in Fig. 1A, AngII, but not SII, provokes a rapid increase in intracellular calcium in HEK-AT1AR cells. Despite its inability to produce Gq/11 signaling, SII has been shown to promote β-arrestin binding, AT1AR receptor internalization, and β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation (4Holloway A.C. Qian H.

Fig. 1B demonstrates the effects of AngII and SII on the cellular distribution of AT1AR-GFP. Both ligands promote receptor internalization, as demonstrated by the loss of cell surface receptors after 30 min of agonist exposure. The effect of SII is reversed in the presence of the neutral AT1AR antagonist losartan, demonstrating that its actions are mediated through binding to the AT1AR orthosteric ligand binding site. As shown in Fig. 1C, both SII and AngII stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-AT1AR cells. As reported previously (5Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 2088-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), this effect of SII is β-arrestin-dependent because it is blocked by siRNA silencing of β-arrestin 1/2 expression. In contrast, AngII-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was not significantly affected by β-arrestin silencing, likely because of the preservation of G-protein-dependent signaling pathways (11Lee M.H. El-Shewy H.M. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2088-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, AngII acts as a conventional GPCR agonist in our system, activating G-protein signaling and promoting β-arrestin-dependent receptor internalization, whereas SII behaves as an arrestin pathway-selective biased agonist, producing receptor internalization and β-arrestin-dependent signaling without detectable Gq/11 activation. To gain insight into the G-protein-independent AT1AR signaling network, we performed a two-dimensional gel-based analysis of changes in protein phosphorylation upon SII stimulation. HEK-AT1AR cells were stimulated for 5 min with either AngII or SII, and whole cell phosphoproteins were enriched by column chromatography on Pro Q Diamond resin. Equal protein amounts of enriched sample were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and phosphoproteins were visualized using a Pro Q Diamond fluorescent stain with Sypro Ruby counterstaining for total protein. Fig. 2A depicts representative Pro Q Diamond-stained two-dimensional gels from vehicle-, SII-, and AngII-stimulated cells. Protein spots that differed in Pro Q Diamond staining intensity by a minimum of 2-fold were selected for identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF peptide mass fingerprinting. Of 63 individual phospho-protein spots matched across gels, 34 displayed a 2-fold or greater increase or decrease in intensity in response to either SII or AngII. Of these, 28 were identified by mass spectroscopy on the basis of at least six individual tryptic peptide fragments per protein. Fig. 2A (overlay) depicts the position of selected identified proteins on a gel overlay generated using PD Quest. Table 1 lists all protein identifications, along with the relative magnitude of change observed in SII- or AngII-treated samples.TABLE 1Phosphoprotein quantificationProteinSpot intensityNon-stimulatedRatioAngRatioSIIRatioANP32B105.91164.91.613363126.18aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.RBM8B105.917402.269.9aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.7692.972.64aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.Prohibitin (PHB1)105.91164.91.66807.664.28aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.RPLP0105.913352.231.7aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.6191.458.46aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.Actin105.9111,377.9107.4aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.5076.547.93aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.HBGB1105.91164.91.64277.640.39aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.I1PP2A105.91164.91.63307.231.23aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.Calreticulin105.915299.750.0aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.2508.323.68aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.CK2β105.913843.136.3aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.1243.311.74aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.I2PP2A3266.214663.31.421,299.76.52aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.Vimentin111213956.13.6aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.3257.12.93aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.NAP1L11064.511719.81.63086.62.9aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.HNRPC4838.1159721.213,761.12.84aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.Sds22806.912276.92.8aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.1933.42.4aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.β-Actin955.51887.80.92291.42.4aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.α-Tubulin 24858.613613.60.711,613.22.39aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.RPLP115,49218692.90.6360942.33aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.PDCD52407.116346.32.6aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.5577.72.32aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.I1PP2A2629.41164.90.1bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.3509.51.33HSP90α9082.6119,608.42.2aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.90190.99PGES342,875184,582.92.0aSpots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.20,539.80.91β-Tubulin14,98317147.20.5bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.12,146.20.81HSP70-2353413125.30.91581.40.45bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.I1PP2A13,332112,096.40.93390.40.25bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.HSP90β20,406124,046.81.25054.30.25bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.I1PP2A9354.514009.60.4bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.22560.24bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.α-Tubulin7281.117041.31.01628.20.22bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.NDUFS37613.716331.10.81170.02bSpots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated.a Spots with >2-fold increased intensity relative to non-stimulated.b Spots with >2-fold decreased intensity relative to non-stimulated. Open table in a new tab Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis offers only limited coverage of transmembrane proteins, proteins with high molecular weight, or proteins with a highly basic pI. Despite this limited window, comparison of the global changes in protein phosphorylation revealed surprising differences between AngII and SII. As shown in Fig. 2B, only 10 of 34 phosphoprotein spots changed in response to both AngII and SII, whereas an additional 16 appeared to be responsive only to SII. It is unclear whether this is due to limitations in the detection threshold of our assay or to qualitative differences in signaling by SII-bound AT1AR. Nonetheless, it is clear that SII elicited a robust protein phosphorylation response despite its failure to activate G-protein signaling. The list of 28 identified pho"
https://openalex.org/W2054850848,"Development of targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major challenge. We have recently identified an elevated expression of the fifth subunit of COP9 signalosome (CSN5) in early HCC as compared with dysplastic stage. In the present study, we explored the possibility of CSN5 being a potential therapeutic target for HCC. Our results show that CSN5 knockdown by small-interfering (si) RNA caused a strong induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell-cycle progression in HCC cells in vitro. The down-regulation of CSN5 was sufficient to interfere with CSN function as evidenced by the accumulation of neddylated Cullin 1 and changes in the protein levels of CSN-controlled substrates SKP2, p53, p27 and nuclear factor-κB, albeit to a different degree depending on the HCC cell line, which could account for the CSN5 knockdown phenotype. The transcriptomic analysis of CSN5 knockdown signature showed that the anti-proliferative effect was driven by a common subset of molecular alterations including down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and integrin β1 (ITGB1), which were functionally interconnected with key oncogenic regulators MYC and TGFβ1 involved in the control of proliferation, apoptotic cell death and HCC progression. Consistent with microarray analysis, western blotting revealed that CSN5 depletion increased phosphorylation of Smad 2/3, key mediators of TGFβ1 signaling, decreased the protein levels of ITGB1, CDK6 and cyclin D1 and caused reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, while elevating the levels of pro-apoptotic Bak. A chemically modified variant of CSN5 siRNA was then selected for in vivo application based on the growth inhibitory effect and minimal induction of unwanted immune response. Systemic delivery of the CSN5 3/8 variant by stable-nucleic-acid-lipid particles significantly suppressed the tumor growth in Huh7-luc+ orthotopic xenograft model. Taken together, these results indicate that CSN5 has a pivotal role in HCC pathogenesis and maybe an attractive molecular target for systemic HCC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1973665513,"Histone H4 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs) at its N-terminal tail. Many of these PTMs profoundly affect the on and off status of gene transcription. The molecular mechanism by which histone PTMs modulate genetic and epigenetic processes is not fully understood. In particular, how a PTM mark affects the presence and level of other histone modification marks needs to be addressed and is essential for better understanding the molecular basis of histone code hypothesis. To dissect the interplaying relationship between different histone modification marks, we investigated how individual lysine acetylations and their different combinations at the H4 tail affect Arg-3 methylation in cis. Our data reveal that the effect of lysine acetylation on arginine methylation depends on the site of acetylation and the type of methylation. Although certain acetylations present a repressive impact on PRMT1-mediated methylation (type I methylation), lysine acetylation generally is correlated with enhanced methylation by PRMT5 (type II dimethylation). In particular, Lys-5 acetylation decreases the activity of PRMT1 but increases that of PRMT5. Furthermore, circular dichroism study and computer simulation demonstrate that hyperacetylation increases the content of ordered secondary structures at the H4 tail region. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of Arg-3 methylation by H4 acetylation and unravel the complex intercommunications that exist between different the PTM marks in cis. The divergent activities of PRMT1 and PRMT5 with respect to different acetyl-H4 substrates suggest that type I and type II protein-arginine methyltransferases use distinct molecular determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2089749994,"The Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II (AgI/II) is a cell surface-localized protein that adheres to salivary components and extracellular matrix molecules. Here we report the 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of the complete C-terminal region of AgI/II. The C-terminal region is comprised of three major domains: C(1), C(2), and C(3). Each domain adopts a DE-variant IgG fold, with two β-sheets whose A and F strands are linked through an intramolecular isopeptide bond. The adherence of the C-terminal AgI/II fragments to the putative tooth surface receptor salivary agglutinin (SAG), as monitored by surface plasmon resonance, indicated that the minimal region of binding was contained within the first and second DE-variant-IgG domains (C(1) and C(2)) of the C terminus. The minimal C-terminal region that could inhibit S. mutans adherence to SAG was also confirmed to be within the C(1) and C(2) domains. Competition experiments demonstrated that the C- and N-terminal regions of AgI/II adhere to distinct sites on SAG. A cleft formed at the intersection between these C(1) and C(2) domains bound glucose molecules from the cryo-protectant solution, revealing a putative binding site for its highly glycosylated receptor SAG. Finally, electron microscopy images confirmed the elongated structure of AgI/II and enabled building a composite tertiary model that encompasses its two distinct binding regions."
https://openalex.org/W2044137980,"Recently, mitochondria have been suggested to act in tumor suppression. However, the underlying mechanisms by which mitochondria suppress tumorigenesis are far from being clear. In this study, we have investigated the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the tumor suppressor protein p53 using a set of respiration-deficient (Res−) mammalian cell mutants with impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Our data suggest that normal mitochondrial function is required for γ-irradiation (γIR)-induced cell death, which is mainly a p53-dependent process. The Res− cells are protected against γIR-induced cell death due to impaired p53 expression/function. We find that the loss of complex I biogenesis in the absence of the MWFE subunit reduces the steady-state level of the p53 protein, although there is no effect on the p53 protein level in the absence of the ESSS subunit that is also essential for complex I assembly. The p53 protein level was also reduced to undetectable levels in Res− cells with severely impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis. This suggests that p53 protein expression is differentially regulated depending upon the type of electron transport chain/respiratory chain deficiency. Moreover, irrespective of the differences in the p53 protein expression profile, γIR-induced p53 activity is compromised in all Res− cells. Using two different conditional systems for complex I assembly, we also show that the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on p53 expression/function is a reversible phenomenon. We believe that these findings will have major implications in the understanding of cancer development and therapy. Recently, mitochondria have been suggested to act in tumor suppression. However, the underlying mechanisms by which mitochondria suppress tumorigenesis are far from being clear. In this study, we have investigated the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the tumor suppressor protein p53 using a set of respiration-deficient (Res−) mammalian cell mutants with impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Our data suggest that normal mitochondrial function is required for γ-irradiation (γIR)-induced cell death, which is mainly a p53-dependent process. The Res− cells are protected against γIR-induced cell death due to impaired p53 expression/function. We find that the loss of complex I biogenesis in the absence of the MWFE subunit reduces the steady-state level of the p53 protein, although there is no effect on the p53 protein level in the absence of the ESSS subunit that is also essential for complex I assembly. The p53 protein level was also reduced to undetectable levels in Res− cells with severely impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis. This suggests that p53 protein expression is differentially regulated depending upon the type of electron transport chain/respiratory chain deficiency. Moreover, irrespective of the differences in the p53 protein expression profile, γIR-induced p53 activity is compromised in all Res− cells. Using two different conditional systems for complex I assembly, we also show that the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on p53 expression/function is a reversible phenomenon. We believe that these findings will have major implications in the understanding of cancer development and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2085347056,"Elevated production of the matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is strongly implicated in epithelial tumor progression. Inhibition of synthesis of the hyaluronan precursor UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) therefore presents an emerging target for cancer therapy. Human UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (hUGDH) catalyzes, in two NAD(+)-dependent steps without release of intermediate aldehyde, the biosynthetic oxidation of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) to UDP-GlcUA. Here, we present a structural characterization of the hUGDH reaction coordinate using crystal structures of the apoenzyme and ternary complexes of the enzyme bound with UDP-Glc/NADH and UDP-GlcUA/NAD(+). The quaternary structure of hUGDH is a disc-shaped trimer of homodimers whose subunits consist of two discrete α/β domains with the active site located in the interdomain cleft. Ternary complex formation is accompanied by rigid-body and restrained movement of the N-terminal NAD(+) binding domain, sequestering substrate and coenzyme in their reactive positions through interdomain closure. By alternating between conformations in and out of the active site during domain motion, Tyr(14), Glu(161), and Glu(165) participate in control of coenzyme binding and release during 2-fold oxidation. The proposed mechanism of hUGDH involves formation and breakdown of thiohemiacetal and thioester intermediates whereby Cys(276) functions as the catalytic nucleophile. Stopped-flow kinetic data capture the essential deprotonation of Cys(276) in the course of the first oxidation step, allowing the thiolate side chain to act as a trap of the incipient aldehyde. Because thiohemiacetal intermediate accumulates at steady state under physiological reaction conditions, hUGDH inhibition might best explore ligand binding to the NAD(+) binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1985848631,"Ion channel trafficking and gating are often influenced by interactions with auxiliary subunits. Tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b) is an auxiliary subunit for neuronal hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. TRIP8b interacts directly with two distinct sites of HCN channel pore-forming subunits to control channel trafficking and gating. Here we use mutagenesis combined with electrophysiological studies to define and distinguish the functional importance of the HCN/TRIP8b interaction sites. Interaction with the last three amino acids of the HCN1 C terminus governed the effect of TRIP8b on channel trafficking, whereas TRIP8b interaction with the HCN1 cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) affected trafficking and gating. Biochemical studies revealed that direct interaction between TRIP8b and the HCN1 CNBD was disrupted by cAMP and that TRIP8b binding to the CNBD required an arginine residue also necessary for cAMP binding. In accord, increasing cAMP levels in cells antagonized the up-regulation of HCN1 channels mediated by a TRIP8b construct binding the CNBD exclusively. These data illustrate the distinct roles of the two TRIP8b-HCN interaction domains and suggest that TRIP8b and cAMP may directly compete for binding the HCN CNBD to control HCN channel gating, kinetics, and trafficking."

The identification of the residues of ILY and hCD59 that form their binding interface revealed a remarkably deep correspondence between the hCD59 binding site for ILY and that for the MAC proteins C8α and C9. ILY disengages from hCD59 during the prepore to pore transition, suggesting that loss of this interaction is necessary to accommodate specific structural changes associated with this transition. Consistent with this scenario, mutants of hCD59 or ILY that increased the affinity of this interaction decreased the cytolytic activity by slowing the transition of the prepore to pore but not the assembly of the prepore oligomer. A signature motif was also identified in the hCD59 binding CDCs that revealed a new hCD59-binding member of the CDC family. Although the binding site on hCD59 for ILY, C8α, and C9 exhibits significant homology, no similarity exists in their binding sites for hCD59.

https://openalex.org/W2171372056,"Two related ER oxidation 1 (ERO1) proteins, ERO1α and ERO1β, dynamically regulate the redox environment in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Redox changes in cysteine residues on intralumenal loops of calcium release and reuptake channels have been implicated in altered calcium release and reuptake. These findings led us to hypothesize that altered ERO1 activity may affect cardiac functions that are dependent on intracellular calcium flux. We established mouse lines with loss of function insertion mutations in Ero1l and Ero1lb encoding ERO1α and ERO1β. The peak amplitude of calcium transients in homozygous Ero1α, mutant adult cardiomyocytes was reduced to 42.0 ± 2.2% (n=10, P≤0.01) of values recorded in wild-type cardiomyocytes. Decreased ERO1 activity blunted cardiomyocyte inotropic response to adrenergic stimulation and sensitized mice to adrenergic blockade. Whereas all 12 wild-type mice survived challenge with 4 mg/kg esmolol, 6 of 8 compound Ero1l and Ero1lb mutant mice succumbed to this level of β adrenergic blockade (P≤0.01). In addition, mice lacking ERO1α were partially protected against progressive heart failure in a transaortic constriction model [at 10 wk postprocedure, fractional shortening was 0.31 ±0.02 in the mutant (n=20) vs. 0.23±0.03 in the wild type (n=18); P≤0.01]. These findings establish a role for ERO1 in calcium homeostasis and suggest that modifying the lumenal redox environment may affect the progression of heart failure.—Chin, K.

https://openalex.org/W2086761225,"Plant pathogenic fungi use a wide range of different strategies to gain access to the carbon sources of their host plants. The hemibiotrophic maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola (teleomorph Glomerella graminicola) colonizes its host plants, and, after a short biotrophic phase, switches to destructive, necrotrophic development. Here we present the identification of five hexose transporter genes from C. graminicola, CgHXT1 to CgHXT5, the functional characterization of the encoded proteins, and detailed expression studies for these genes during vegetative and pathogenic development. Whereas CgHXT4 is expressed under all conditions analyzed, transcript abundances of CgHXT1 and CgHXT3 are transiently up-regulated during the biotrophic phase, and CgHXT2 and CgHXT5 are expressed exclusively during necrotrophic development. Analyses of the encoded proteins characterized CgHXT5 as a low-affinity/high-capacity hexose transporter with a narrow substrate specificity for glucose and mannose. In contrast, CgHXT1 to CgHXT3 are high affinity/low capacity transporters that also accept other substrates, including fructose, galactose, or xylose. CgHXT4, the largest of the identified proteins, has only little transport activity and may function as a sugar sensor. Phylogenetic studies revealed hexose transporters closely related to the five CgHXT proteins also in other pathogenic fungi suggesting conserved functions of these proteins during fungal pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999076503,"2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) is a five-carbon alcohol produced and emitted in large quantities by many species of pine native to western North America. MBO is structurally and biosynthetically related to isoprene and can have an important impact on regional atmospheric chemistry. The gene for MBO synthase was identified from Pinus sabiniana, and the protein encoded was functionally characterized. MBO synthase is a bifunctional enzyme that produces both MBO and isoprene in a ratio of ∼90:1. Divalent cations are required for activity, whereas monovalent cations are not. MBO production is enhanced by K+, whereas isoprene production is inhibited by K+ such that, at physiologically relevant [K+], little or no isoprene emission should be detected from MBO-emitting trees. The Km of MBO synthase for dimethylallyl diphosphate (20 mm) is comparable with that observed for angiosperm isoprene synthases and 3 orders of magnitude higher than that observed for monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MBO synthase falls into the TPS-d1 group (gymnosperm monoterpene synthases) and is most closely related to linalool synthase from Picea abies. Structural modeling showed that up to three phenylalanine residues restrict the size of the active site and may be responsible for making this a hemiterpene synthase rather than a monoterpene synthase. One of these residues is homologous to a Phe residue found in the active site of isoprene synthases. The remaining two Phe residues do not have homologs in isoprene synthases but occupy the same space as a second Phe residue that closes off the isoprene synthase active site. 2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) is a five-carbon alcohol produced and emitted in large quantities by many species of pine native to western North America.

Both groups of isoprene synthases closely resemble angiosperm monoterpene synthases in sequence and structure (9Sharkey T.D. Yeh S. Wiberley A.E. Falbel T.G. Gong D. Fernandez D.E.

The plant terpene synthase (TPS) gene family consists of several different subfamilies (14Bohlmann J. Meyer-Gauen G. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 15Chen F. Tholl D. Bohlmann J. Pichersky E. Plant J. 2011; 66: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In angiosperms, monoterpene synthases group together in the TPS-b subfamily and typically have a functional C-terminal α-domain and a vestigial N-terminal β-domain (13Köksal M. Zimmer I. Schnitzler J.P. Christianson D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 402: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Chen F. Tholl D. Bohlmann J. Pichersky E. Plant J. 2011; 66: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Isoprene synthases from angiosperms (flowering plants) group in the TPS-b subfamily, possess both α- and β-domains, and share the same intron/exon organization (six introns and seven exons) found in the TPS-b subfamily (9Sharkey T.D. Yeh S. Wiberley A.E. Falbel T.G. Gong D. Fernandez D.E. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 700-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15Chen F. Tholl D. Bohlmann J. Pichersky E. Plant J. 2011; 66: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The TPS-b subfamily is found only in the angiosperms and is absent in the gymnosperms. Gymnosperms contain a diverse assemblage of monoterpene synthases, which represent a distinct lineage of genes that are distantly related to the monoterpene synthase genes (TPS-b) found in angiosperms (14Bohlmann J. Meyer-Gauen G. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 15Chen F. Tholl D. Bohlmann J. Pichersky E.

Gymnosperm terpene synthases belong to the TPS-d subfamily (17Martin D.M. Fäldt J. Bohlmann J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1908-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 18Keeling C.I. Weisshaar S. Ralph S.G. Jancsik S. Hamberger B. Dullat H.K. Bohlmann J. BMC Plant Biol. 2011; 11: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is further subdivided into the d1 (mostly monoterpene synthases), d2 (mostly sesquiterpene synthases), and d3 (mostly diterpene synthases) groups. Structurally, genes in the TPS-d1 family share the α- and β-domains found in the angiosperm TPS-b family but have different intron/exon structures (six introns and seven exons in TPS-b and nine introns and 10 exons in TPS-d1). The sequence and structure of hemiterpene synthases found in gymnosperms and the other major taxonomic groups, which do not have TPS-b genes, are unknown. There are numerous examples of similar catalytic activities arising in parallel within the angiosperms and gymnosperms from enzymes that share little sequence identity (15Chen F. Tholl D. Bohlmann J. Pichersky E. Plant J. 2011; 66: 212-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). If such a pattern of parallel evolution also occurs with the hemiterpene synthases of gymnosperms, these genes might demonstrate sequences, structures, and mechanisms of forming hemiterpenes that have not been observed in angiosperms. We set out to find and clone the MBO synthase gene from pines 1) to provide insight into the relationship between hemiterpene synthases in angiosperms and gymnosperms and 2) to investigate the sequence and structural features that distinguish the catalytic activity of MBO synthase from that of monoterpene and isoprene synthases. Understanding the features that distinguish hemiterpene from monoterpene synthases and isoprene from MBO synthases may lead to an understanding of why hemiterpene synthases have evolved in only a small subset of plant taxa. Total RNA was extracted from needles of Pinus sabiniana using a procedure adapted from Chang et al. (19Chang S. Puryear J. Cairney J. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1993; 11: 113-116Crossref Scopus (2949) Google Scholar) to incorporate 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 4% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and 4% β-mercaptoethanol into cetyltrimethylammonium bromide detergent buffer. Purified RNA was stored at −80 °C until used in cDNA synthesis. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used to initiate cDNA synthesis are listed in supplemental Table S1. Degenerate primers targeting conserved regions of known conifer monoterpene synthase genes were used in various combinations to prime PCRs with the cDNA template. PCR was performed in 30-μl volumes using 1.25 units of GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), 0.25 μl of cDNA, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.6 μm each primer, and the manufacturer's buffer at 1× concentration. Amplification was carried out with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35–45 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 9 min. Reactions producing bands of the expected size (determined by gel electrophoresis) were prepared for direct sequencing using a PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen). Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730 genetic analyzer at the Michigan State University Research Technology Support Center. The resulting sequence information was analyzed by BLAST (20Altschul S.F.

Primers used in the RACE procedures are listed in supplemental Table S1. To obtain 5′-ends, a pair of nested gene-specific reverse primers (pon3.1R and pon4.1R) were designed for the target sequence. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using the outer primer (pon3.1R). A poly(A) tail was added to the 3′-end of the single-stranded cDNA using terminal transferase (Invitrogen) and served as an anchor primer for subsequent PCR in which template and primer concentrations were varied over a 10-fold range to find the optimal reaction conditions. Amplification was carried out in two steps with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by one cycle of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 48 °C for 5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 40 min and 35–45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55–65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 9 min. Reactions yielding positive PCR hits were purified and sequenced directly as described above. Primers designed for the 5′-UTR and 3′-end of the candidate MBO synthase sequence (supplemental Table S1) were used to amplify the full-length gene from cDNA using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnlabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were gel-purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and single overhanging A residues were attached by incubation with dATP and Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs), ligated into pGEM-T (Promega), and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α for plasmid amplification. Plasmids containing inserts were sequenced to confirm sequence fidelity and the absence of internal stop codons. The sequence for a codon-optimized gene was designed using the Gene Designer software package and synthesized by DNA2.0, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA), ligated into pJexpress 401, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). This construct coded for the MBO synthase amino acid sequence without the predicted plastid transport sequence and with a C-terminal His6 tag. Cell cultures of transformed cell lines were grown in LB medium to A600 = 0.8 in 500-ml Erlenmeyer baffle flasks at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for an additional 4 h at 30 °C for protein expression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4000 × g, 4 °C). To extract proteins, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 40% glycerol), sonicated, and centrifuged to pellet cell fragments (45 min, 5000 × g, 4 °C). This lysate was used in enzyme assays, frozen at −80 °C for storage, or purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose (Qiagen). His-tagged proteins were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose columns with all steps performed at 4 °C. Cell lysate was loaded onto a column equilibrated with lysis buffer, and non-His-tagged proteins were eluted with 4 volumes of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, 40% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole). His-tagged proteins bound to Ni-NTA-agarose were eluted with 4 volumes of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, 50% glycerol, and 250 mm imidazole). Fractions (0.5 ml) of the eluate were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining to identify fractions containing the eluted protein. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Enzyme assays were performed in 20-μl total reaction volumes contained in 2-ml screw cap vials. Reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 20 mm DTT, 40% glycerol, and 5 μl of crude extract or purified enzyme, with concentrations of substrate, cofactors, and pH varied for specific assays. Vials were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, after which a 2-ml gas sample was withdrawn from the headspace of the vial using a syringe and manually injected onto a stainless steel cryotrapping sample loop immersed in liquid nitrogen and purged with helium. The cryoconcentrated sample was flash-desorbed and injected onto the column of a Shimadzu GC17A chromatograph equipped with a photoionization detector. Separation was performed on a DB1 column (30 m, 0.32 mm inner diameter, 5-μm film; J&W Scientific) held isothermally at 60 °C with a head pressure of 23 p.s.i. Headspace concentrations of volatiles were determined from 4-point standard curves run daily by injecting various amounts of 100 ppm isoprene and MBO from standard tanks obtained from Scott-Marrin (Riverside, CA). We corrected for partitioning of MBO into the liquid phase using the Henry's constant of 65 m/atmosphere (23Iraci L.T. Baker B.M. Tyndall G.S. Orlando J.J. J. Atmos.

Chem. 1999; 33: 321-330Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, it was calculated that 16 times more MBO was in the liquid phase than the gas phase in our system. Because the Henry's constant of isoprene (24Copolovici L.O. Niinemets U. Chemosphere. 2005; 61: 1390-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) predicts very little partitioning into water, no correction was applied. Amino acid sequence data for angiosperm and gymnosperm terpene synthases were obtained from GenBankTM (NCBI), combined with the sequence we obtained for MBO synthase, and aligned with the Espresso module of Tcoffee (25Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5405) Google Scholar) using the crystal structures of Protein Data Bank codes 2J5C, 3N0F, and 5EAU to provide structural information for the alignment process. The resulting alignment was edited by hand to correct minor misalignments and yielded a final alignment containing 1105 sites. Sequences were analyzed in a Bayesian framework using MrBayes 3.1 (26Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19060) Google Scholar, 27Ronquist F. Huelsenbeck J.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1572-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24943) Google Scholar). Five independent runs each with three heated chains (temperature parameter 0.2) and one cold chain were extended for one million generations with rate variation across sites modeled as an invariant γ-distribution. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm sampled several amino acid substitution matrices and always selected the Jones matrix (28Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). Trees were sampled every 1000 generations, yielding 1000 trees/run. Homology models were constructed using the SWISS-MODEL automated mode (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar, 30Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of bornyl diphosphate synthase (Protein Data Bank code 1N20) as a template. This structure was used in preference to the isoprene synthase structure (13Köksal M. Zimmer I. Schnitzler J.P. Christianson D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 402: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) because 1N20 had greater resolution (2.0 versus 2.8 Å), features helix H3 in the closed conformation, and has both the J-K loop and N-terminal arm fully resolved. Magnesium atoms and substrates were manually docked into the resulting models in positions corresponding to those observed in the 1N20 structure using PyMOL v1.3. Active site residues were identified by searching for atoms within 6 Å of the docked substrate. Using degenerate PCR primers designed to match conserved regions of conifer monoterpene synthase genes, we amplified a series of sequence fragments from cDNA derived from the needles of P. sabiniana. One of these sequences encodes a phenylalanine seven residues upstream of the magnesium-binding site (DDXXD) in a position homologous to that occupied by a Phe residue in angiosperm isoprene synthases (9Sharkey T.D. Yeh S. Wiberley A.E. Falbel T.G. Gong D. Fernandez D.E. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 700-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Following 3′- and 5′-RACE procedures, a complete sequence (GenBankTM accession number JF719039) coding for a peptide 614 amino acids in length with a 40-amino acid plastid transport sequence predicted by ChloroP was obtained (32Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Expression of a codon-optimized sequence in E. coli (with the predicted plastid transport sequence omitted) gave good expression of a soluble 70-kDa protein that could be purified on Ni-NTA-agarose. Enzyme function was assayed by incubating extracts with DMADP and analyzing the products released into the reaction vial headspace. GC revealed the presence of two peaks with retention times identical to those of authentic isoprene and MBO standards (supplemental Fig. S1). The products were confirmed to be isoprene and MBO by GC/MS (supplemental Fig. S2). Assays of extracts from non-induced E. coli and on boiled purified protein showed only trace levels of isoprene or MBO, whereas those run on crude and purified extracts yielded large amounts of both MBO and isoprene in a ratio of ≈90:1 (Fig. 1). MBO synthase exhibited a broad pH optimum that was nearly flat from pH 6 to 9.5. Incubation at varying pH values had no impact on the relative amounts of isoprene and MBO produced. Divalent cations were required for enzyme activity (Fig. 2). Isoprene production increased with Mg2+ to saturation at 7.5 mm and remained constant at Mg2+ concentrations up to 100 mm, whereas MBO production increased to a peak at 25 mm Mg2+ and declined at higher concentrations (Fig. 2, upper panel). Enzyme activity peaked at lower concentrations of manganese (2 mm) for both MBO and isoprene production and exhibited inhibition at Mn2+ concentrations greater than 50 mm (Fig. 2, middle panel). Although MBO synthase activity peaked at lower concentrations of Mn2+, MBO synthase activity was 33–35% higher using Mg2+ as a cofactor compared with using Mn2+ (Fig. 2, lower panel). MBO synthase did not require a monovalent cation for activity; however, some monovalent cations could alter both enzyme activity and the MBO/isoprene product ratio (Fig. 3, upper panel). Most monovalent cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ as chloride salts) inhibited isoprene production. Li+ and Cs+ strongly inhibited MBO production, whereas NH4+ and Na+ inhibited MBO production slightly. In contrast, K+ and Rb+ strongly enhanced MBO production. MBO production was 3.1 times higher when incubated with K+ (100 mm) and 2.4 times higher when incubated with Rb+ (100 mm) than in the absence of a monovalent cation. K+ was the preferred cation for MBO production, with MBO synthase exhibiting 22% more activity with K+ than with Rb+. MBO production by MBO synthase exhibited a type II response (33Page M.J. Di Cera E. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1049-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) to K+, with saturation occurring above 100 mm (Fig. 3, lower panel). However, at higher K+ concentrations, isoprene production exhibited an exponential decline, which mirrored the shape of the rise in MBO production (Fig. 3, lower panel). However, because of the nearly 100-fold different scales of MBO and isoprene production, the mirrored curves do not represent a 1:1 trade-off in response to increasing K+. MBO synthase activity increased with DMADP concentration to a maximum of ∼16 mm for both MBO and isoprene production, but higher concentrations of substrate inhibited enzyme activity (Fig. 4). The ratio of MBO to isoprene produced remained constant over the range of DMADP concentrations examined. Incubating MBO synthase with either geranyl diphosphate (GDP) or isopentenyl diphosphate did not result in the detectable formation of monoterpene or hemiterpene products. A modified Michaelis-Menten equation that allows for cooperativity and substrate inhibition was fitted to the MBO and isoprene production data in Fig. 4 (Equation 1),V=Vmax1+KmHSH+SXKisXEq. 1 where H is the Hill coefficient describing cooperativity, Kis is the binding affinity of the substrate for the enzyme-substrate complex, and x is the number of substrate molecules that could bind to and inactivate the enzyme-substrate complex (see supplemental Fig. S3 for the complete kinetic model) (34Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 519-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35LiCata V.J. Allewell N.M. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fitting by finding the minimum of the sum of squared errors yielded a Km of 20.0 mm DMADP and a Vmax of 212 pmol mg−1 s−1 for MBO production and a Km of 18.2 mm DMADP and a Vmax of 5.6 pmol mg−1 s−1 for isoprene production. The Hill coefficients were 1.2 and 1.4 for MBO and isoprene, respectively, indicating little cooperativity for MBO synthase. A simpler fitting procedure fitting only the data showing no obvious substrate inhibition but allowing for cooperativity gave a Km of 10.3 mm DMADP, a Vmax of 116 pmol mg−1 s−1, and a Hill coefficient of 1.2 for MBO production. The enzyme kinetic parameters for MBO synthase are compared with those of isoprene synthases and other terpene synthases in Table 1. With the exception of a larger Hill coefficient in the kudzu isoprene synthase, hemiterpene synthases behave similarly, with kcat values comparable with those reported for both monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases.TABLE 1Comparison of selected terpene synthase enzyme kinetic parametersEnzymeProductkcatKmHill coefficientRef.s−1Malus domestica farnesene synthaseFarnesene0.055310–25 μmaThis is the concentration used in the assay when the Km was not reported.37Green S.

Open table in a new tab A gene tree was constructed to examine the placement of MBO synthase within the broader terpene synthase gene family (Fig. 5). The gene most closely related to MBO synthase is a linalool synthase from Picea abies, with which MBO synthase shares 82% amino acid identity. Also closely related to MBO synthase are farnesene synthases from P. abies and Pinus taeda. Together, these enzymes form a strongly supported clade (posterior probability of 96%) of related enzymes producing an acyclic hemiterpene alcohol (MBO), an acyclic monoterpene alcohol (linalool), and an acyclic sesquiterpene (E-α-farnesene) nested within what is otherwise a clade dominated by enzymes producing cyclic monoterpenes. Comparison of the placement of MBO synthase with the placement of the isoprene synthases found in angiosperms shows that these two hemiterpene-forming enzymes are distantly related. MBO synthase shares only 33–34% amino acid identity with the Populus alba and Pueraria montana (kudzu) isoprene synthases. MBO synthase nes"

IntroductionThe progression of replication forks is often stalled due to DNA damage or intrinsic DNA secondary structures. The stalled replication forks must be properly resolved to accurately complete DNA replication and prevent genomic instability. At stalled replication forks, single-strand DNA (ssDNA) is generated and extended by helicases. These ssDNA regions are bound by replication protein A, which not only protects these ssDNA regions from nucleolytic digestions but also recruits checkpoint proteins to initiate replication checkpoint signaling (3Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 4Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Haaf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One way that RPA 2The abbreviations used are: RPAreplication protein ASFBS protein, FLAG, and streptavidin-binding peptideHUhydroxyurea.-ssDNA complex promotes checkpoint signaling is through its recruitment and interaction with ATRIP/ATR to facilitate ATR-dependent signal transduction (5Cimprich K.A.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In addition, RPA-ssDNA complex also recruits RAD51 and other recombination factors to initiate homologous recombination processes (8Jackson S.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 9Stauffer M.E. Chazin W.J. J. Biol.

Recently, several studies have also revealed a physical and functional interaction between RPA and an annealing helicase SMARCAL1/HARP, which facilitates replication fork stabilization (10Bansbach C.E. Bétous R. Lovejoy C.A. Glick G.G. Cortez D. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2405-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Ciccia A. Bredemeyer A.L. Sowa M.E. Terret M.E. Jallepalli P.V. Harper J.W.

Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2400-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, the RPA complex, which consists of three subunits of RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3, acts as a platform to mediate multiple protein-protein interactions at ongoing or stalled replication forks that play an essential role in DNA replication, DNA repair, and recombination (1Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Here we showed that an E3 ligase RFWD3 interacts directly with RPA2 and is recruited to stalled replication forks in response to replication stress. Moreover, depletion of RFWD3 leads to defective Chk1 activation after replication stress. These results suggest that RFWD3 is a new player involved in DNA replication checkpoint control.DISCUSSIONThe RPA complex plays an essential role in DNA replication, DNA repair, and the initiation of DNA damage and replication checkpoints (16Golub E.I. Gupta R.C. Haaf T. Wold M.S. Radding C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5388-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 77: 593-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is proposed that these diverse functions of RPA come from its abilities to interact with many binding partners. It has been reported that RPA interacts with RAD9, RAD17, and ATRIP, which are involved in the assembly of the 9-1-1 complex at stalled replication forks, and the activation of ATR signaling during DNA replication checkpoint (6Zou L.

In this study we demonstrated that RFWD3 is a new binding partner of RPA.RFWD3 was first identified as a substrate of kinase ATM/ATR in a large-scale proteomic analysis of proteins phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (24Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z. Solimini N. Lerenthal Y. Shiloh Y. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 17330-17334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RFWD3 contains an SQ-rich region in the N terminus, a RING domain, a coil-coil domain, and a WD40 domain in the C terminus. It has been suggested that RFWD3 displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and forms a RFWD3-Mdm2-p53 complex to regulate p53 degradation in response to DNA damage (15Fu X. Yucer N. Liu S. Li M. Yi P. Mu J.J. Yang T. Chu J. Jung S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Gu W. Qin J. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that RFWD3 directly interacts with RPA2, a subunit of the RPA complex. The region containing the coiled-coil motif of RFWD3 is required for its binding to RPA2. Furthermore, RFWD3 is recruited to stalled replication forks and co-localizes with RPA2 in response to replication stress. Functional analysis revealed that RFWD3 is important for Chk1 activation after replication stress. In addition, deletion of RPA2 binding region on RFWD3 impairs its localization to stalled replication forks and Chk1 activation upon replication stress. Together, these data strongly support that RFWD3 is a new component involved in replication checkpoint control.The precise function of RFWD3 at stalled replication forks remains to be elucidated. We showed that deletion of the RING domain of RFWD3 failed to rescue HU-induced Chk1 activation, indicating that this domain and its associated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity are likely to be required for RFWD3 function in replication checkpoint. We propose that in response to replication stress, ssDNA regions generated at stalled replication forks are coated by RPA. Through its interaction with RPA, RFWD3 is recruited to these stalled replication forks and exerts its E3 ligase activity to ubiquitinate yet-to-be-identified substrates, which is required for replication checkpoint control (Fig. 4D). The future studies will focus on the identification of these RFWD3 substrates, which will allow us to understand the complex regulation of replication checkpoint pathway.

Recently, several studies have also revealed a physical and functional interaction between RPA and an annealing helicase SMARCAL1/HARP, which facilitates replication fork stabilization (10Bansbach C.E.

Thus, the RPA complex, which consists of three subunits of RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3, acts as a platform to mediate multiple protein-protein interactions at ongoing or stalled replication forks that play an essential role in DNA replication, DNA repair, and recombination (1Fanning E.

Here we showed that an E3 ligase RFWD3 interacts directly with RPA2 and is recruited to stalled replication forks in response to replication stress. Moreover, depletion of RFWD3 leads to defective Chk1 activation after replication stress.

DISCUSSIONThe RPA complex plays an essential role in DNA replication, DNA repair, and the initiation of DNA damage and replication checkpoints (16Golub E.I. Gupta R.C. Haaf T. Wold M.S. Radding C.M.

It has been reported that RPA interacts with RAD9, RAD17, and ATRIP, which are involved in the assembly of the 9-1-1 complex at stalled replication forks, and the activation of ATR signaling during DNA replication checkpoint (6Zou L.

In this study we demonstrated that RFWD3 is a new binding partner of RPA.RFWD3 was first identified as a substrate of kinase ATM/ATR in a large-scale proteomic analysis of proteins phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (24Matsuoka S.

RFWD3 contains an SQ-rich region in the N terminus, a RING domain, a coil-coil domain, and a WD40 domain in the C terminus. It has been suggested that RFWD3 displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and forms a RFWD3-Mdm2-p53 complex to regulate p53 degradation in response to DNA damage (15Fu X. Yucer N. Liu S. Li M. Yi P. Mu J.J. Yang T. Chu J. Jung S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Gu W. Qin J. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that RFWD3 directly interacts with RPA2, a subunit of the RPA complex. The region containing the coiled-coil motif of RFWD3 is required for its binding to RPA2. Furthermore, RFWD3 is recruited to stalled replication forks and co-localizes with RPA2 in response to replication stress. Functional analysis revealed that RFWD3 is important for Chk1 activation after replication stress. In addition, deletion of RPA2 binding region on RFWD3 impairs its localization to stalled replication forks and Chk1 activation upon replication stress. Together, these data strongly support that RFWD3 is a new component involved in replication checkpoint control.The precise function of RFWD3 at stalled replication forks remains to be elucidated. We showed that deletion of the RING domain of RFWD3 failed to rescue HU-induced Chk1 activation, indicating that this domain and its associated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity are likely to be required for RFWD3 function in replication checkpoint. We propose that in response to replication stress, ssDNA regions generated at stalled replication forks are coated by RPA. Through its interaction with RPA, RFWD3 is recruited to these stalled replication forks and exerts its E3 ligase activity to ubiquitinate yet-to-be-identified substrates, which is required for replication checkpoint control (Fig. 4D). The future studies will focus on the identification of these RFWD3 substrates, which will allow us to understand the complex regulation of replication checkpoint pathway.

The virus contains an antisense RNA genome divided into three segments, and named according to lengths as the S, M, and L (for Small, Medium, and Large) segments (4Schmaljohn C.S. Hooper J.W. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Bunyaviridae: the Viruses and Their Replication. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). The viral proteins are the nucleocapsid protein, two membrane glycoproteins Gn and Gc (also referred to as G1 and G2 in other Bunyaviridae) (5Sanchez A.J. Vincent M.J. Nichol S.T. J.

Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). In the mature virion, the Gn glycoprotein contains a 176 residue ectodomain followed by a 24 residue transmembrane region and terminates in a long cytoplasmic tail consisting of ∼100 residues (5Sanchez A.J. Vincent M.J. Nichol S.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7263-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Altamura L.A. Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. Teigler J. Paragas J. Schmaljohn C.S. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6632-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Recent results from other related Bunyaviridae viruses suggest the role of the Gn tail in viral assembly. For example, alanine mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic tails of Uukuniemi virus (genus Phlebovirus) (8Overby A.K. Pettersson R.F. Neve E.P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3198-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Bunyamwera virus (genus Orthobunyavirus) (9Shi X. Kohl A. Li P. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10151-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) affect the ability of virus-like particles (VLPs) to effectively incorporate ribonucleoproteins, thus intimating a role for Gn tails in genome packaging. More recently, the Gn tail of Puumala virus (genus Hantavirus) was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the Puumala nucleocapsid protein (10Hepojoki J.M. Strandin T. Wang H. Vapalahti O. Vaheri A. Lankinen H. J. Gen. Virol. 2010; 91: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the CCHF virus Gn tail plays an equally important role in viral assembly of genus Nairovirus.The sequence of the CCHF virus cytoplasmic tail is somewhat variable in Nairoviruses (∼24% identity) and even more so when compared with other Bunyaviruses (12% identity with Hantavirus Gn tails). However, one characteristic feature present in four of the five genera of Bunyaviridae is a conserved dual C-X-C-X-H-X-C motifs of cysteine and histidine residues with X representing any amino acid (Fig. 1). Others have suggested that the high cysteine content of the CCHF virus Gn tail could be due to extensive disulfide bonding (5Sanchez A.J. Vincent M.J. Nichol S.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7263-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the cysteines in the Andes hantavirus Gn tail fold into a novel arrangement of back-to-back classical ββα zinc fingers (11Estrada D.F. Boudreaux D.M. Zhong D. St Jeor S.C. De Guzman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8654-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite low sequence identity between the Gn tail of Nairoviruses and Hantaviruses, the spacing of the dual CCHC motif in the CCHF virus most closely resembles that of Hantaviruses, suggesting the presence of a similar dual zinc finger structure. To test this hypothesis, we determined the NMR structure of the CCHF virus Gn cytoplasmic tail from residues 729–805. We report here the first known atomic structure of any protein component of the CCHF virus and demonstrate that the high cysteine content of the Gn cytoplasmic tail is partly due to the presence of dual, back to back ββα-type zinc fingers similar to those found in Hantaviruses. Unlike Hantaviral zinc fingers, however, the electrostatic surface of the CCHF virus zinc finger reveals a clear distribution of conserved electrostatic charges. Moreover, we demonstrate using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) that these conserved electrostatics may play a role in forming a surface for binding viral RNA. Together, these data provide insight into the role of the Gn tail in Nairovirus assembly.DISCUSSIONWe report here that an envelope glycoprotein of a Nairovirus contains a dual CCHC-type zinc finger (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) domain that binds RNA. Although zinc fingers have been known in viruses, in particular, the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein zinc fingers (33De Guzman R.N. Wu Z.R. Stalling C.C. Pappalardo L. Borer P.N. Summers M.F. Science. 1998; 279: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) are critical in RNA packaging and viral assembly, zinc fingers are rarely found in viral envelope glycoproteins. Including the zinc finger in this report, there are currently only three known structures of viral envelope glycoprotein zinc fingers. First is the zinc finger of the Hantavirus G1 envelope glycoprotein (11Estrada D.F. Boudreaux D.M. Zhong D. St Jeor S.C. De Guzman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8654-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and second is the zinc finger of the Junin virus envelope glycoprotein (34Briknarová K. Thomas C.J. York J. Nunberg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1528-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (also an RNA virus, of family Arenaviridae). In all three cases, the cytoplasmic tails of the envelope glycoproteins contain the zinc finger domains. The Junin virus zinc fingers (34Briknarová K. Thomas C.J. York J. Nunberg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1528-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) form a unique fold that do not show any structural nor sequence similarity with the Nairovirus and Hantavirus zinc fingers. Although the Nairovirus and the Hantavirus zinc fingers (11Estrada D.F. Boudreaux D.M. Zhong D. St Jeor S.C. De Guzman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8654-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which both belong to family Bunyaviridae (Fig. 1), show an overall similar global fold (supplemental Fig. S3), they also have major structural differences (Fig. 6) and properties (Fig. 7).Key Differences between Nairovirus and Hantavirus Gn Zinc FingersExamination of the surface electrostatics of the CCHF virus Gn tail reveals key differences when compared with the Andes hantavirus structure (Fig. 6). Whereas the CCHF Gn tail displays sharp clustering of conserved charges that form a large contiguous swath on the protein surface, the Andes hantavirus zinc fingers display charges that are predominately negative and apparently randomly dispersed (Fig. 6). The variation in charge conservation is also evident in the sequence analysis (supplemental Fig. S3). Whereas the spacing of CCHC motif is mostly conserved, the spacing between conserved charges is highly variable. The CCHF virus displays conserved negative charges on ZF1 and conserved positive charges on ZF2. The Andes hantavirus sequence, however, displays clustering of conserved positive charges on the sequences flanking the negatively charged core zinc finger structure.Moreover, the CCHF virus Gn tail contains a structural motif that is absent in the Andes hantavirus structure. Helices α2 and α3 (Fig. 3B), residues Leu-773 to Leu-792, form a helix-kink-helix motif due the positioning of the conserved helix breaker Pro-781. While not an uncommon motif, this structural aspect in the CCHF Gn tail forms the core scaffold for a large positively charged surface partly composed of the conserved charges at Arg-775, Lys-782, and Lys-786 (Fig. 6A). By contrast, the Andes hantavirus structure contains neither the corresponding proline nor the charges to support a similar motif (Fig. 1). Instead, it contains the non-conserved helix breaker Gly-598 followed by conserved charges exclusively on the C-terminal end of ZF2 (Fig. 1). In this respect, the surface electrostatics of the CCHF virus Gn tail may more closely resemble that of Orthobunyaviruses, with conserved helix breakers flanked by conserved basic charges (Fig. 1). Perhaps not coincidentally, Nairoviruses and Orthobunyaviruses are both arthropod-borne, whereas Hantaviruses are rodent-borne (3Elliott R.M. Bouloy M. Calisher C.H. Goldbach R. Moyer J.T. Nichol S.T. Pettersson R. Plyusnin A. Schmaljohn C. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Carsten E.B. Estes M.K. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J. Mayo M.A. McGeoch D.J. Pringle C.R. Wickner R.B. Bunyaviridae. Academic Press, San Diego2000Google Scholar). Overall, the general preservation of the fold indicates that the dual zinc finger motif plays a general but important role in the life cycle of both Nairoviruses and Hantaviruses. However, the major differences in the surface electrostatics of the CCHF virus and Hantavirus cytoplasmic tail structures (Fig. 6) also suggests that while general, the function of the tail may be species specific.Proposed Role in Viral AssemblyGiven the data available regarding the Bunyaviridae Gn role in viral assembly (8Overby A.K. Pettersson R.F. Neve E.P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3198-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Shi X. Kohl A. Li P. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10151-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Hepojoki J.M. Strandin T. Wang H. Vapalahti O. Vaheri A. Lankinen H. J. Gen. Virol. 2010; 91: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is likely that the surface electrostatics play an important role in assembly of the CCHF virus, presumably via direct interaction with some component of the ribonucleoprotein. The large positively charged surface of the Gn tail would suggest RNA binding, as is the traditional role for zinc fingers in retroviruses (33De Guzman R.N. Wu Z.R. Stalling C.C. Pappalardo L. Borer P.N. Summers M.F. Science. 1998; 279: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 35D'Souza V. Summers M.F. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Our EMSA results (Fig. 7) suggest that this may in fact be the case. Using increasing amounts of Gn729–805 revealed the migration of an additional RNA band (Fig. 7B), which likely represents a protein-RNA complex consisting of Gn729–805 and the hairpin-like M segment panhandle. While the observed complex is weakly bound and therefore likely to be nonspecific, these results suggest RNA interaction mediated by some of the conserved residues in the Gn tail. Additionally, these results suggest the possibility of an interaction between the Gn tail and the RNA component of the ribonucleoproteins (Fig. 7C). A reverse genetics system for studying the CCHF virus has only recently been developed (36Flick R. Flick K. Feldmann H. Elgh F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5997-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), thus allowing testing of this model in the future.In summary, we present the NMR structure of a zinc finger domain in the Gn tail of the CCHF virus. Currently, this is the only available atomic structure for a protein component of the Nairovirus genus. The global fold of this zinc finger is similar to that of the Hantavirus zinc finger, which represents a unique fold of two classical-type ββα-zinc fingers that are stuck together (in contrast, individual classical ββα-zinc fingers behave as independent domains, like beads-on-a-string). We also demonstrated that the CCHF virus Gn tail binds RNA in vitro, thus suggesting the possibility of an interaction between the Gn tail with the viral RNA. Taken together, our results contribute novel mechanistic insight toward understanding the CCHF virus life cycle.

In the mature virion, the Gn glycoprotein contains a 176 residue ectodomain followed by a 24 residue transmembrane region and terminates in a long cytoplasmic tail consisting of ∼100 residues (5Sanchez A.J.

For example, alanine mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic tails of Uukuniemi virus (genus Phlebovirus) (8Overby A.K. Pettersson R.F. Neve E.P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3198-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Bunyamwera virus (genus Orthobunyavirus) (9Shi X. Kohl A. Li P. Elliott R.M. J.

More recently, the Gn tail of Puumala virus (genus Hantavirus) was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the Puumala nucleocapsid protein (10Hepojoki J.M. Strandin T. Wang H. Vapalahti O. Vaheri A. Lankinen H. J. Gen. Virol. 2010; 91: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the CCHF virus Gn tail plays an equally important role in viral assembly of genus Nairovirus.The sequence of the CCHF virus cytoplasmic tail is somewhat variable in Nairoviruses (∼24% identity) and even more so when compared with other Bunyaviruses (12% identity with Hantavirus Gn tails). However, one characteristic feature present in four of the five genera of Bunyaviridae is a conserved dual C-X-C-X-H-X-C motifs of cysteine and histidine residues with X representing any amino acid (Fig. 1). Others have suggested that the high cysteine content of the CCHF virus Gn tail could be due to extensive disulfide bonding (5Sanchez A.J. Vincent M.J. Nichol S.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7263-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the cysteines in the Andes hantavirus Gn tail fold into a novel arrangement of back-to-back classical ββα zinc fingers (11Estrada D.F. Boudreaux D.M. Zhong D. St Jeor S.C.

Despite low sequence identity between the Gn tail of Nairoviruses and Hantaviruses, the spacing of the dual CCHC motif in the CCHF virus most closely resembles that of Hantaviruses, suggesting the presence of a similar dual zinc finger structure. To test this hypothesis, we determined the NMR structure of the CCHF virus Gn cytoplasmic tail from residues 729–805. We report here the first known atomic structure of any protein component of the CCHF virus and demonstrate that the high cysteine content of the Gn cytoplasmic tail is partly due to the presence of dual, back to back ββα-type zinc fingers similar to those found in Hantaviruses. Unlike Hantaviral zinc fingers, however, the electrostatic surface of the CCHF virus zinc finger reveals a clear distribution of conserved electrostatic charges. Moreover, we demonstrate using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) that these conserved electrostatics may play a role in forming a surface for binding viral RNA.

Here, we show that in addition to its well defined role in transcription, LXRβ directly binds to the C-terminal region (2247LTSFL2251) of ABCA1 to mediate its post-translational regulation. In the absence of cholesterol accumulation in the macrophage-like cell line THP-1, the ABCA1-LXRβ complex stably localizes to the plasma membrane, but apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) binding or cholesterol efflux does not occur. Exogenously added LXR ligands, which mimic cholesterol accumulation, cause LXRβ to dissociate from ABCA1, thus freeing ABCA1 for apoA-I binding and subsequent cholesterol efflux. Photoaffinity labeling experiments with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP showed that the interaction of LXRβ with ABCA1 inhibits ATP binding by ABCA1. This is the first study to show that a protein-protein interaction with the endogenous protein suppresses the function of ABC proteins by inhibiting ATP binding.

However, the precise mechanism(s) by which ABCA1 activity is regulated post-translationally remains unclear.We previously reported (16Hozoji M. Munehira Y. Ikeda Y. Makishima M. Matsuo M. Kioka N.

In WI-38 and THP-1 cells, endogenous LXRβ interacts with ABCA1 under conditions in which LXR ligands do not accumulate, i.e. when cholesterol is not in excess. LXRβ suppresses ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. However, the mechanism by which LXRβ suppresses ABCA1 functions was not clear. In this study, we identified two leucine residues in the C-terminal region of ABCA1 responsible for the interaction with LXRβ and showed that LXRβ interaction suppresses ATP binding to ABCA1 and thereby keeps ABCA1 standby on the plasma membrane for acute cholesterol accumulation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we showed that LXRβ interacts directly with ABCA1 and that the interaction with ABCA1 recruits LXRβ in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in the absence of LXR ligands, i.e. when cholesterol is not in excess in cells. By the addition of LXR ligands, LXR dissociates from ABCA1 and disappears from the vicinity of the plasma membrane. LXRβ interaction blocks apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol loading by ABCA1 onto apoA-I, thus keeping ABCA1 standby on the plasma membrane.We first identified two leucine residues, Leu2247 and Leu2251, responsible for the interaction with LXRβ. These are contained within a motif (2247LTSFL2251) with similarities to the φXXφφ (26Métivier R. Stark A. Flouriot G. Hübner M.R. Brand H. Penot G. Manu D. Denger S. Reid G. Kos M. Russell R.B.

Because apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux by ABCA1, blocked by LXRβ interaction, are both ATP-dependent processes (25Nagao K. Zhao Y. Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of the LXRβ on the ATP binding/hydrolysis activity of ABCA1. LXRβ interaction blocked ATP binding at 0 °C or the formation of stable complex with ATP at 37 °C.When multidrug transporters, MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (ABCC2) hydrolyze ATP, γ-phosphate dissociates from the catalytic site before ADP does, and they trap Mg-ADP in the presence of orthovanadate, an analog of phosphate, and form a stable inhibitory intermediate during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Therefore, these proteins can be specifically photoaffinity-labeled when these proteins in crude membranes were reacted with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP at 37 °C in the presence of orthovanadate (27Hashimoto K.

However, ABCA1 forms a stable complex with nucleotide even in the absence of orthovanadate when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). ABCA1 was originally proposed not to be an active transporter but a regulator in apoA-I-dependent cholesterol release based on this unique ATP-binding feature (31Szakács G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orsó E. Schmitz G. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Now it was reported that ABCA1 functions as a receptor for apoA-I as well as an active lipid transporter (25Nagao K. Zhao Y. Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This unique ATP-binding feature of ABCA1 could be related to the unique functions of ABCA1. LXRβ interaction with two leucine residues, Leu2247 and Leu2251, of ABCCA1 probably causes some drastic conformational changes in ABCA1, which block ATP binding to two ATP binding domains of ABCA1 and thereby block apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol loading by ABCA1 onto apoA-I.Current models predict that ABCA1 expression on the cell surface should promote cholesterol efflux, but when THP-1 cells were cultured under control conditions, no apoA-I binding or no cholesterol efflux was observed despite significant expression of ABCA1 on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, no ATP binding by ABCA1 was observed, suggesting that ABCA1 expressed on the cell surface is nonfunctional in THP-1 cells under these conditions. Addition of LXR agonists led to ATP binding by ABCA1, substantial cell binding by apoA-I, and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux by ABCA1. We previously reported that endogenous cytosolically localized LXRβ in THP-I cells interacted with ABCA1 on the plasma membrane under conditions in which cholesterol does not accumulate. Taken together, these results indicate that ABCA1 on the plasma membrane of THP-1 cells is nonfunctional under normal conditions because LXRβ interaction with ABCA1 suppressed ATP binding to ABCA1 and that the increase of LXR ligands immediately triggers apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and subsequent cholesterol efflux before de novo ABCA1 transcription in THP-1 cells.The half-life of ABCA1 is 1–2 h (13Munehira Y.

Thus, if cells relied solely on the transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 to modulate cholesterol efflux, there could be a substantial delay between the detection of increased cellular cholesterol levels and increased protein expression of ABCA1. This delay could be detrimental for macrophages during acute cholesterol accumulation following the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. We propose that LXRβ, whose expression does not change during cholesterol accumulation (26Métivier R. Stark A. Flouriot G. Hübner M.R. Brand H. Penot G. Manu D. Denger S. Reid G. Kos M. Russell R.B.

As illustrated in Fig. 7, in the absence of excess cholesterol, LXRβ, probably as a heterodimer with RXR as reported (16Hozoji M. Munehira Y. Ikeda Y. Makishima M. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30057-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), binds to the C-terminal region (2247LTSFL2251) of ABCA1.ABCA1-LXRβ/RXR complex stably localizes to the plasma membrane, but ATP binding to the nucleotide binding domain of ABCA1 is blocked by LXRβ/RXR, and consequently apoA-I binding or cholesterol efflux does not occur. When cholesterol accumulates, oxysterols bind to LXRβ leading to its dissociation from ABCA1. This allows ABCA1 immediately to become functional, leading apoA-I binding and the release of excess cholesterol. Thus, LXRβ exerts an immediate effect to rid the cell of excess cholesterol, and it also promotes a slower transcriptional response leading to changes in gene expression that allow for a robust cellular response to cholesterol accumulation. It has been reported that a protein, US6, of the human cytomegalovirus, prevents ATP binding to the ABC transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and inhibits the function of TAP to evade immune surveillance (37Hewitt E.W. Gupta S.S. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This is the first study to show that a protein-protein interaction of the endogenous protein suppresses the function of ABCA1 by inhibiting ATP binding, and LXRβ acts as both a transcriptional and post-translational regulator of ABCA1 activity.

In this study, we identified two leucine residues in the C-terminal region of ABCA1 responsible for the interaction with LXRβ and showed that LXRβ interaction suppresses ATP binding to ABCA1 and thereby keeps ABCA1 standby on the plasma membrane for acute cholesterol accumulation. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we showed that LXRβ interacts directly with ABCA1 and that the interaction with ABCA1 recruits LXRβ in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in the absence of LXR ligands, i.e. when cholesterol is not in excess in cells. By the addition of LXR ligands, LXR dissociates from ABCA1 and disappears from the vicinity of the plasma membrane. LXRβ interaction blocks apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol loading by ABCA1 onto apoA-I, thus keeping ABCA1 standby on the plasma membrane.We first identified two leucine residues, Leu2247 and Leu2251, responsible for the interaction with LXRβ. These are contained within a motif (2247LTSFL2251) with similarities to the φXXφφ (26Métivier R. Stark A. Flouriot G. Hübner M.R. Brand H. Penot G. Manu D. Denger S. Reid G. Kos M. Russell R.B.

Because apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux by ABCA1, blocked by LXRβ interaction, are both ATP-dependent processes (25Nagao K. Zhao Y. Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of the LXRβ on the ATP binding/hydrolysis activity of ABCA1. LXRβ interaction blocked ATP binding at 0 °C or the formation of stable complex with ATP at 37 °C.When multidrug transporters, MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (ABCC2) hydrolyze ATP, γ-phosphate dissociates from the catalytic site before ADP does, and they trap Mg-ADP in the presence of orthovanadate, an analog of phosphate, and form a stable inhibitory intermediate during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Therefore, these proteins can be specifically photoaffinity-labeled when these proteins in crude membranes were reacted with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP at 37 °C in the presence of orthovanadate (27Hashimoto K. Uchiumi T. Konno T. Ebihara T. Nakamura T. Wada M. Sakisaka S. Maniwa F. Amachi T. Ueda K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1236-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Taguchi Y.

However, ABCA1 forms a stable complex with nucleotide even in the absence of orthovanadate when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). ABCA1 was originally proposed not to be an active transporter but a regulator in apoA-I-dependent cholesterol release based on this unique ATP-binding feature (31Szakács G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orsó E. Schmitz G. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Now it was reported that ABCA1 functions as a receptor for apoA-I as well as an active lipid transporter (25Nagao K. Zhao Y. Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This unique ATP-binding feature of ABCA1 could be related to the unique functions of ABCA1. LXRβ interaction with two leucine residues, Leu2247 and Leu2251, of ABCCA1 probably causes some drastic conformational changes in ABCA1, which block ATP binding to two ATP binding domains of ABCA1 and thereby block apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol loading by ABCA1 onto apoA-I.Current models predict that ABCA1 expression on the cell surface should promote cholesterol efflux, but when THP-1 cells were cultured under control conditions, no apoA-I binding or no cholesterol efflux was observed despite significant expression of ABCA1 on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, no ATP binding by ABCA1 was observed, suggesting that ABCA1 expressed on the cell surface is nonfunctional in THP-1 cells under these conditions. Addition of LXR agonists led to ATP binding by ABCA1, substantial cell binding by apoA-I, and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux by ABCA1. We previously reported that endogenous cytosolically localized LXRβ in THP-I cells interacted with ABCA1 on the plasma membrane under conditions in which cholesterol does not accumulate. Taken together, these results indicate that ABCA1 on the plasma membrane of THP-1 cells is nonfunctional under normal conditions because LXRβ interaction with ABCA1 suppressed ATP binding to ABCA1 and that the increase of LXR ligands immediately triggers apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and subsequent cholesterol efflux before de novo ABCA1 transcription in THP-1 cells.The half-life of ABCA1 is 1–2 h (13Munehira Y.

This delay could be detrimental for macrophages during acute cholesterol accumulation following the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. We propose that LXRβ, whose expression does not change during cholesterol accumulation (26Métivier R. Stark A. Flouriot G. Hübner M.R. Brand H. Penot G. Manu D. Denger S. Reid G. Kos M. Russell R.B.

As illustrated in Fig. 7, in the absence of excess cholesterol, LXRβ, probably as a heterodimer with RXR as reported (16Hozoji M. Munehira Y. Ikeda Y. Makishima M. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol.

When cholesterol accumulates, oxysterols bind to LXRβ leading to its dissociation from ABCA1. This allows ABCA1 immediately to become functional, leading apoA-I binding and the release of excess cholesterol. Thus, LXRβ exerts an immediate effect to rid the cell of excess cholesterol, and it also promotes a slower transcriptional response leading to changes in gene expression that allow for a robust cellular response to cholesterol accumulation. It has been reported that a protein, US6, of the human cytomegalovirus, prevents ATP binding to the ABC transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and inhibits the function of TAP to evade immune surveillance (37Hewitt E.W. Gupta S.S. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This is the first study to show that a protein-protein interaction of the endogenous protein suppresses the function of ABCA1 by inhibiting ATP binding, and LXRβ acts as both a transcriptional and post-translational regulator of ABCA1 activity. In this study, we showed that LXRβ interacts directly with ABCA1 and that the interaction with ABCA1 recruits LXRβ in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in the absence of LXR ligands, i.e. when cholesterol is not in excess in cells. By the addition of LXR ligands, LXR dissociates from ABCA1 and disappears from the vicinity of the plasma membrane. LXRβ interaction blocks apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol loading by ABCA1 onto apoA-I, thus keeping ABCA1 standby on the plasma membrane. We first identified two leucine residues, Leu2247 and Leu2251, responsible for the interaction with LXRβ. These are contained within a motif (2247LTSFL2251) with similarities to the φXXφφ (26Métivier R. Stark A. Flouriot G. Hübner M.R. Brand H. Penot G. Manu D. Denger S. Reid G. Kos M. Russell R.B.

Because apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux by ABCA1, blocked by LXRβ interaction, are both ATP-dependent processes (25Nagao K. Zhao Y. Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of the LXRβ on the ATP binding/hydrolysis activity of ABCA1. LXRβ interaction blocked ATP binding at 0 °C or the formation of stable complex with ATP at 37 °C. When multidrug transporters, MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (ABCC2) hydrolyze ATP, γ-phosphate dissociates from the catalytic site before ADP does, and they trap Mg-ADP in the presence of orthovanadate, an analog of phosphate, and form a stable inhibitory intermediate during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Therefore, these proteins can be specifically photoaffinity-labeled when these proteins in crude membranes were reacted with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP at 37 °C in the presence of orthovanadate (27Hashimoto K. Uchiumi T. Konno T. Ebihara T. Nakamura T. Wada M. Sakisaka S. Maniwa F. Amachi T. Ueda K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1236-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Taguchi Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, ABCA1 forms a stable complex with nucleotide even in the absence of orthovanadate when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). ABCA1 was originally proposed not to be an active transporter but a regulator in apoA-I-dependent cholesterol release based on this unique ATP-binding feature (31Szakács G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orsó E. Schmitz G. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Now it was reported that ABCA1 functions as a receptor for apoA-I as well as an active lipid transporter (25Nagao K. Zhao Y. Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Ueda K. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1165-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This unique ATP-binding feature of ABCA1 could be related to the unique functions of ABCA1. LXRβ interaction with two leucine residues, Leu2247 and Leu2251, of ABCCA1 probably causes some drastic conformational changes in ABCA1, which block ATP binding to two ATP binding domains of ABCA1 and thereby block apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and cholesterol loading by ABCA1 onto apoA-I. Current models predict that ABCA1 expression on the cell surface should promote cholesterol efflux, but when THP-1 cells were cultured under control conditions, no apoA-I binding or no cholesterol efflux was observed despite significant expression of ABCA1 on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, no ATP binding by ABCA1 was observed, suggesting that ABCA1 expressed on the cell surface is nonfunctional in THP-1 cells under these conditions. Addition of LXR agonists led to ATP binding by ABCA1, substantial cell binding by apoA-I, and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux by ABCA1. We previously reported that endogenous cytosolically localized LXRβ in THP-I cells interacted with ABCA1 on the plasma membrane under conditions in which cholesterol does not accumulate. Taken together, these results indicate that ABCA1 on the plasma membrane of THP-1 cells is nonfunctional under normal conditions because LXRβ interaction with ABCA1 suppressed ATP binding to ABCA1 and that the increase of LXR ligands immediately triggers apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and subsequent cholesterol efflux before de novo ABCA1 transcription in THP-1 cells. The half-life of ABCA1 is 1–2 h (13Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S. Furuya A. Shitara K. Imamura M. Yokota T. Takeda S. Amachi T. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol.

Two TD hydrolysis products, 2-phthalimidoglutaramic acid (PGMA) and 2-phthalimidoglutaric acid (PGA), were similarly embryopathic, attenuating otic vesicle (ear) and limb bud formation by up to 36 and 77%, respectively (P<0.05). TD, PGMA, and PGA all increased embryonic DNA oxidation measured as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) by up to 2-fold (P<0.05). Co- or pretreatment with the PHS inhibitors eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), or the free-radical spin trap phenylbutylnitrone (PBN), completely blocked embryonic 8-oxoG formation and/or embryopathies initiated by TD, PGMA, and PGA. This is the first demonstration of limb bud embryopathies initiated by TD, as well as its hydrolysis products, in a mammalian embryo culture model of a species susceptible to TD in vivo, indicating that all likely contribute to TD teratogenicity in vivo, in part through PHS-dependent, ROS-mediated mechanisms.—Lee, C.

https://openalex.org/W1983495719,"Most clock-controlled genes (CCGs) lack the specific E-box response element necessary for direct circadian regulation. This is the case for the prolactin (Prl) gene, the expression of which oscillates in individual lactotrope pituitary cells. To characterize the processes underlying this oscillation, we used a lactotrope cell line (GH4C1 cells). In these cells, Prl gene expression fluctuated significantly during 24 h (P=0.0418). Circadian Prl transcription depended on an interaction between the pituitary-specific transcription factor, PIT-1, and the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, shown here to bind the Prl promoter on an E-box that differs from the specific E-box preferentially bound by clock proteins. Circadian Prl transcription was further accompanied by marked daily chromatin transitions. While neither HLTF nor PIT-1 was rhythmically expressed, NONO and SFPQ, identified as HLTF-associated proteins by mass spectrometry, displayed a circadian pattern and bound rhythmically to the Prl promoter. Furthermore, NONO and SFPQ were functionally involved in circadian Prl transcription since overexpression of both proteins greatly reduced Prl promoter activity (P<0.001) and disrupted its circadian pattern. A mechanism involving a rhythm in paraspeckle protein recruitment is proposed to explain how the core oscillator can generate a circadian pattern of CCGs lacking the specific E-box response element.—Guillaumond, F., Boyer, B., Becquet, D., Guillen, S., Kuhn, L., Garin, J., Belghazi, M., Bosler, O., Franc, J.

https://openalex.org/W1997223018,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export and cell surface transport of nascent G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have just begun to be revealed and previous studies have shown that hydrophobic motifs in the putative amphipathic 8(th) α-helical region within the membrane-proximal C termini play an important role. In this study, we demonstrate that di-acidic motifs in the membrane-distal, nonstructural C-terminal portions are required for the exit from the ER and transport to the plasma membrane of angiotensin II receptors, but not adrenergic receptors. More interestingly, distinct di-acidic motifs dictate optimal export trafficking of different angiotensin II receptors and export ability of each acidic residue in the di-acidic motifs cannot be fully substituted by other acidic residue. Moreover, the function of the di-acidic motifs is likely mediated through facilitating the recruitment of the receptors onto the ER-derived COPII transport vesicles. Therefore, the di-acidic motifs located in the membrane-distal C termini may represent the first linear motifs which recruit selective GPCRs onto the COPII vesicles to control their export from the ER."

CaMKK phosphorylates and activates CaMKI and CaMKIV, which directly activate transcription factors. In this study, we determined the 2.4 Å crystal structure of the catalytic kinase domain of the human CaMKKβ isoform complexed with its selective inhibitor, STO-609. The structure revealed that CaMKKβ lacks the αD helix and that the equivalent region displays a hydrophobic molecular surface, which may reflect its unique substrate recognition and autoinhibition. Although CaMKKβ lacks the activation loop phosphorylation site, the activation loop is folded in an active-state conformation, which is stabilized by a number of interactions between amino acid residues conserved among the CaMKK isoforms. An in vitro analysis of the kinase activity confirmed the intrinsic activity of the CaMKKβ kinase domain. Structure and sequence analyses of the STO-609-binding site revealed amino acid replacements that may affect the inhibitor binding. Indeed, mutagenesis demonstrated that the CaMKKβ residue Pro(274), which replaces the conserved acidic residue of other protein kinases, is an important determinant for the selective inhibition by STO-609. Therefore, the present structure provides a molecular basis for clarifying the known biochemical properties of CaMKKβ and for designing novel inhibitors targeting CaMKKβ and the related protein kinases."

However, there are some indications that the ATR-mediated checkpoint can be activated by other mechanisms. Here, using the well defined Escherichia coli lac repressor/operator system, we have found that directly tethering the ATR activator topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) to DNA is sufficient to induce ATR phosphorylation of Chk1 in an in vitro system as well as in vivo in mammalian cells. In addition, we find synergistic activation of ATR phosphorylation of Chk1 when the mediator protein Claspin is also tethered to the DNA with TopBP1.

It is comprised of three proteins: the translocase component, protective antigen (PA, 83 kDa); and two enzyme components, lethal factor (LF, 91 kDa) and edema factor (EF, 89 kDa). These secreted proteins must assemble into holotoxin complexes either on the surface of cells or in the blood serum (13Kintzer A.F. Sterling H.J. Tang I.I. Abdul-Gader A. Miles A.J. Wallace B.A. Williams E.R. Krantz B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 399: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In each assembly mechanism, PA is initially cleaved by a protease, allowing a small 20-kDa portion to dissociate. The remaining 63-kDa PA fragment can then self-assemble into either a ring-shaped homoheptamer, PA7 (14Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Binding occurs at the top of the prechannel and in a deep amphipathic cleft, termed the α clamp, which also aids in unfolding the substrate (17Feld G.K. Thoren K.L. Kintzer A.F. Sterling H.J. Tang I.I. Greenberg S.G. Williams E.R. Krantz B.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The complex is then endocytosed by the target host cell, and subsequent acidification of the endosome causes the PA oligomer to convert into a transmembrane channel. Moreover, the ΔpH generated by the acidification of the endosome facilitates the unfolding (11Krantz B.A. Trivedi A.D. Cunningham K. Christensen K.A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and translocation of LF and EF through PA (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol.

Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The Φ clamp is located inside the PA channel (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol.

It is comprised of a narrowly apposed ring of seven or eight Phe427 residues, where one Phe is contributed by each PA monomer in the oligomer (2Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The Φ clamp prefers to make interactions with hydrophobic and aromatic groups, and its activity facilitates translocation (2Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) by helping to unfold the substrate (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). How the Φ clamp stimulates (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) ΔpH-driven translocation is unclear. Although a ΔpH can drive translocation, the groups that are protonated and/or deprotonated in the substrate and/or channel are unknown. One clue is provided by the known cation selectivity of the PA channel (18Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 2209-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This selectivity is likely due to the ∼100–150 glutamic and aspartic acid residues (depending upon the oligomeric state of PA) known to be located inside the PA channel (2Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 19Nassi S. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This cation selectivity is unusual given the acidic isoelectric points of both LF and EF (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus we previously proposed a ΔpH-driven charge state Brownian ratchet translocation mechanism (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which is based upon the theoretical work of Feynman et al. (20Feynman R.P. Leighton R.B. Sands M. The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA1963: 46-1-46-9Google Scholar), Oster and co-workers (21Simon S.M. Peskin C.S. Oster G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3770-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and Astumian (22Astumian R.D. Science. 1997; 276: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the large available thermal energy of the translocating protein is biased in a useful and directed way by the proton gradient, thereby supporting productive translocation. Because the channel is cation-selective and, therefore, anion-repulsive, we expect that anionic residues within the portion of LF or EF passing through the channel must be protonated, thus making the translocating chain net cationic. The segment of LF within the channel is in fact net positive, as shown by Δψ-dependent measurements, which report positive z values (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Once the Brownian thermal energy of the translocating protein causes the substrate to exit to the higher pH cytosolic side of the membrane, deprotonation to a more anionic state is favored. The resulting charge repulsion can then enforce directionality during translocation by preventing backward movement through the anionic channel. This process then repeats in multiple cycles toward completion. In this report, we investigate how ΔpH-driven translocation depends upon charged residues in the substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange procedure. WT PA was expressed and purified as described (2Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). PA7 oligomers were produced as described (12Kintzer A.F. Thoren K.L. Sterling H.J. Dong K.C. Feld G.K. Tang I.I. Zhang T.T. Williams E.R. Berger J.M. Krantz B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). His6-LFN (residues 1–263 of LF) and mutants thereof were purified from overexpressing bacteria using standard Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography, when required (GE Healthcare) (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When indicated, His6 tags, which are amino-terminal, 17-residue leaders containing a hexahistidine sequence, MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPR, were removed from His6-LFN with bovine α-thrombin treatment (0.5 units/mg of protein) for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 m glucose at pH 8.0. Note that after thrombin cleavage, an additional GSHM sequence was left at the amino terminus of all cleaved LFN constructs derived from the pET15b plasmid. More complex synthetic LFN constructs were made using a three-step, gene synthesis procedure, according to the following scheme: HM1AGGHGDVGM10HVKEKEKNKD20ENKRKDEERN30KTQEEHLKEI40MKHIVKIEVK50GEEAVKKEAA60EKLLEKVPSD70VLEMYKAIGG80KIYIVD. The underlined pairs of amino acids on either end were encoded by the restriction sites, NdeI and a silent SalI site (Val84 and Asp85), respectively, which were used for cloning. Superscripted numbers indicate the numbering convention of LF residues in PDB ID 1J7N (23Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the desired sequences with the amino-terminal replacement were synthesized (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Hayward, CA) and amplified by two rounds of PCR. In Round I, 22 nm of nested oligonucleotides with consistent annealing temperatures of ∼55 °C were amplified in a standard PCR. In Round II, 1 μl of the PCR product made in Round I was amplified with the two outermost PCR primers (1 μm each) to make the synthetic double-stranded DNA fragment. These LFN synthetic DNA fragments were ligated via a 5′ NdeI site and 3′ SalI site into the pET15b-LFN(SalI) construct, which contains an in-frame, silent SalI restriction site in LFN at Val84 and Asp85. The synthetic LFN constructs were overexpressed and purified, and their His6 tags were subsequently removed as described above (when required). Planar lipid bilayer currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Membrane bilayers were painted onto a 100-μm aperture of a 1-ml polyethersulfone cup with 3% 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in neat n-decane. Cis (side to which the PA oligomer is added) and trans chambers were bathed in the indicated buffers as required. By convention, Δψ ≡ ψcis − ψtrans (ψtrans ≡ 0 V), and ΔpH ≡ pHtrans − pHcis. Translocation experiments were carried out as described (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Kintzer A.F. Thoren K.L. Sterling H.J. Dong K.C. Feld G.K. Tang I.I. Zhang T.T. Williams E.R. Berger J.M. Krantz B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) generally using a universal pH bilayer buffer system (UBB: 10 mm oxalic acid, 10 mm phosphoric acid, 10 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA). However, for translocations requiring a pH > 7.5, we used an altered UBB (6 mm oxalic acid, 6 mm phosphoric acid, 6 mm MES, 6 mm boric acid, 6 mm TAPS, 1 mm EDTA), which is better at buffering in the 7.5–9 range. We found that these two types of buffers produced consistent translocation results. Generally, an additional 100 mm equivalent of KCl was added to the UBB and maintained symmetrically in most translocation experiments, excepting when translocation kinetics were monitored in the absence of a Δψ. In that case, additional KCl was only added to the cis-side buffer. The pHcis was generally 5.6 unless indicated otherwise. In a typical experiment, we first inserted PA7 channels into a planar bilayer by adding the prechannel oligomeric form to the cis-side of the membrane under a small Δψ of 20 mV. Insertion was observed as an increase in current. Then WT or a mutant LFN was added also to the cis-side of the membrane, and a decrease in current was observed. Excess LFN in the cis-compartment was removed by perfusion, and the translocation process was initiated by either raising the Δψ or by creating a ΔpH by raising the pH of the trans chamber. When translocation is initiated by raising the pH of the trans chamber, we set the time when 1% of maximum translocation occurs as t = 0 s to control for different mixing times. An alternative method of creating a proton gradient was also used and provided similar results: the pHcis and pHtrans buffers were preadjusted to their final conditions; after substrate binding to the channel was complete, then the cis buffer was perfused at ∼0 mV at pH 5.6 to maintain the ΔpH, and then the voltage was raised to the final voltage upon the completion of perfusion (after ∼30 s). Single-channel LFN docking experiments were performed as described (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Kintzer A.F. Thoren K.L. Sterling H.J. Dong K.C. Feld G.K. Tang I.I. Zhang T.T. Williams E.R. Berger J.M. Krantz B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Planar lipid bilayers were bathed in symmetric buffer (100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm succinic acid, pH 5.6). PA oligomer was applied directly to membranes at ∼10−16 m. Single channel insertion was observed by a discrete step in current under an applied voltage. Once a single channel had inserted into the membrane, LFN was added to the cis-side of the membrane at 200 pm. Blocking events were recorded at a constant Δψ of 20 mV for various LFN mutants with and without their His6 tag. The data were acquired at 400 Hz using a low pass filter of 200 Hz. For LFN that stably blocked a PA channel, the voltage was reversed to −80 mV after several minutes of conductance block to clear the substrate from the channel; this procedure verified that the channel was still present. Histograms of the current versus time data were fit to a two or three Gaussian function to obtain the relative percentages of time spent in the open, blocked, and partly blocked states. To study translocation, we used planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and a model substrate, LFN, the amino-terminal, 263-residue, PA-binding domain of LF (24Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Fouassier A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3006-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this assay, a planar lipid bilayer separated two aqueous chambers (called cis and trans). We first inserted PA channels into a planar bilayer by adding the prechannel heptameric form of PA to the cis-side of the membrane under a Δψ of 20 mV (Δψ ≡ ψcis − ψtrans, where ψtrans ≡ 0 V). Channel formation, observed as an increase in current, then stabilized, and either wild type (WT) LFN or an LFN mutant (MUT) was added also to the cis-side of the membrane. Subsequently, an exponential decrease in current was observed as the amino-terminal presequence of LFN inserted into the ion-conducting channel and blocked ion flow (25Zhang S. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16756-16761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Excess LFN in the cis compartment was removed by perfusion, and the translocation process was initiated by either changing the Δψ and/or ΔpH. The ensuing current increase that was generally observed resulted from LFN translocation to the trans-side of the membrane, as inferred by control experiments (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Zhang S. Udho E. Wu Z. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus two types of parameters can be obtained from translocation records: the time for half of the protein to translocate (t½, measured in seconds) and the efficiency of translocation, which is equivalent to the fraction of LFN that successfully translocates. Although a ΔpH can drive substrate translocation in the presence of a small, positive Δψ (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it has not yet been shown whether a ΔpH alone is sufficient. To test this possibility, we set up the bilayer with a potassium chloride gradient; this procedure allowed current to flow when Δψ is 0 mV. It should be noted that by design, the voltage-clamp amplifier maintained the system at 0 mV even under a ΔpH, which we defined as ΔpH ≡ pHtrans − pHcis. At a Δψ of 0 mV and positive ΔpH values, we found that both the rate and efficiency of LFN translocation increased with larger positive ΔpH gradients (Fig. 1, inset). We estimated the activation energy of translocation (ΔG‡) using the following relationship, ΔG‡ = RT ln(t½/c), where c is an arbitrary constant of 1 s. The ΔpH dependence of the ΔG‡ for LFN translocation was biphasic with two different limiting slopes (Fig. 1). This dependence is similar to what has been observed under varying ΔpH conditions with a constant, nonzero Δψ (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The relationship fits to a two-barrier model,ΔG‡(ΔpH)=RTIn[exp((ΔG‡o1-2.3n1ΔpH)/RT)+exp((ΔG‡o2-2.3n2ΔpH)/RT)]Eq. 1 where the indexed ΔG‡o and n values are the activation energy and number of protons required to cross each barrier, respectively (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The steeper ΔpH dependence of the ΔG‡ on the left-hand side of the graph (less than 1.2 ΔpH, n1 value of 4.0 (±0.5)) corresponds to a barrier limited by LFN unfolding (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas the shallower ΔpH dependence on the right-hand side (at higher ΔpH values, n2 value of 0.22 (±0.03)) may correspond to a barrier limited by a yet uncharacterized translocation process (6Thoren K.L. Worden E.J. Yassif J.M. Krantz B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21555-21560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We concluded that the chemical potential component of the PMF was sufficient to drive LFN translocation. The charge state Brownian ratchet model (1Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) predicted that negatively charged acidic residues in the substrate are critical to ΔpH-driven translocation. To test this model, we replaced the unstructured amino-terminal presequence of LFN (residues 1–27) with a randomized neutral/uncharged background comprised of Gly, Ser and Thr residues (Fig. 2A). We call this neutral mutant background LFN Syn°. This sequence was still polar and flexible but lacked charged residues. We found that LFN Syn° translocated more slowly than LFN WT under conditions of ΔpH = −0.6 to 1.0, pHcis = 5.6, and Δψ = 60 mV (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the construct possessed a significantly reduced ΔpH dependence (LFN WT: n1 = 1.9 (±0.2); LFN Syn°: n = 0.59 (±0.06); Fig. 2B). (It should be noted that we included the amino-terminal His6 tag in these LFN constructs because of defects in channel blocking for certain constructs, an effect that we explore more fully below. To our knowledge, the His6 tag does not obfuscate our results or interpretations, because we were looking at effects relative to similarly His6-tagged control constructs.) Initially, we predicted that acidic residues alone would be sufficient to restore the defect of LFN Syn° in translocation rate and its weaker ΔpH dependence; however, we found this was not the case. LFN Syn−, which has acidic residues restored at their WT positions, further reduced the rate and efficiency of translocation relative to LFN Syn° and had essentially no ΔpH dependence (n value of 0.0 (±0.1); Fig. 2B). Restoring only basic residues in the LFN Syn+ construct increased the translocation rate relativ"
https://openalex.org/W2094949914,"Predatory marine cone snails (genus Conus) utilize complex venoms mainly composed of small peptide toxins that target voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in their prey. Although the venoms of a number of cone snail species have been intensively profiled and functionally characterized, nothing is known about the initiation of venom expression at an early developmental stage. Here, we report on the expression of venom mRNA in embryos of Conus victoriae and the identification of novel α- and O-conotoxin sequences. Embryonic toxin mRNA expression is initiated well before differentiation of the venom gland, the organ of venom biosynthesis. Structural and functional studies revealed that the embryonic α-conotoxins exhibit the same basic three-dimensional structure as the most abundant adult toxin but significantly differ in their neurological targets. Based on these findings, we postulate that the venom repertoire of cone snails undergoes ontogenetic changes most likely reflecting differences in the biotic interactions of these animals with their prey, predators, or competitors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show toxin mRNA transcripts in embryos, a finding that extends our understanding of the early onset of venom expression in animals and may suggest alternative functions of peptide toxins during development."
https://openalex.org/W1969479370,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is important in numerous normal and pathological processes, including the angiogenic switch during tumor development and tumor metastasis. Whereas TNF-α and other cytokines up-regulate MMP-9 expression, interferons (IFNs) inhibit MMP-9 expression. We found that IFN-γ treatment or forced expression of the IFN-induced GTPase, mGBP-2, inhibit TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. The NF-κB transcription factor is required for full induction of MMP-9 by TNF-α. Both IFN-γ and mGBP-2 inhibit the transcription of a NF-κB-dependent reporter construct, suggesting that mGBP-2 inhibits MMP-9 induction via inhibition of NF-κB-mediated transcription. Interestingly, mGBP-2 does not inhibit TNF-α-induced degradation of IκBα or p65/RelA translocation into the nucleus. However, mGBP-2 inhibits p65 binding to a κB oligonucleotide probe in gel shift assays and to the MMP-9 promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, TNF-α activation of NF-κB in NIH 3T3 cells is dependent on Rac activation, as evidenced by the inhibition of TNF-α induction of NF-κB-mediated transcription by a dominant inhibitory form of Rac1. A role for Rac in the inhibitory action of mGBP-2 on NF-κB is further shown by the findings that mGBP-2 inhibits TNF-α activation of endogenous Rac and constitutively activate Rac can restore NF-κB transcription in the presence of mGBP-2. This is a novel mechanism by which IFNs can inhibit the cytokine induction of MMP-9 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1980863657,"Voltage-dependent calcium channels constitute the main entry pathway for calcium into excitable cells. They are heteromultimers formed by an α1 pore-forming subunit (CaVα1) and accessory subunits. To achieve a precise coordination of calcium signals, the expression and activity of these channels is tightly controlled. The accessory β-subunit (CaVβ), a membrane associated guanylate kinase containing one guanylate kinase (β-GK) and one Src homology 3 (β-SH3) domain, has antagonistic effects on calcium currents by regulating different aspects of channel function. Although β-GK binds to a conserved site within the α1-pore-forming subunit and facilitates channel opening, β-SH3 binds to dynamin and promotes endocytosis. Here, we investigated the molecular switch underlying the functional duality of this modular protein. We show that β-SH3 homodimerizes through a single disulfide bond. Substitution of the only cysteine residue abolishes dimerization and impairs internalization of l-type CaV1.2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes while preserving dynamin binding. Covalent linkage of the β-SH3 dimerization-deficient mutant yields a concatamer that binds to dynamin and restores endocytosis. Moreover, using FRET analysis, we show in living cells that CaVβ form oligomers and that this interaction is reduced by CaVα1. Association of CaVβ with a polypeptide encoding the binding motif in CaVα1 inhibited endocytosis. Together, these findings reveal that β-SH3 dimerization is crucial for endocytosis and suggest that channel activation and internalization are two mutually exclusive functions of CaVβ. We propose that a change in the oligomeric state of CaVβ is the functional switch between channel activator and channel internalizer. Voltage-dependent calcium channels constitute the main entry pathway for calcium into excitable cells. They are heteromultimers formed by an α1 pore-forming subunit (CaVα1) and accessory subunits. To achieve a precise coordination of calcium signals, the expression and activity of these channels is tightly controlled. The accessory β-subunit (CaVβ), a membrane associated guanylate kinase containing one guanylate kinase (β-GK) and one Src homology 3 (β-SH3) domain, has antagonistic effects on calcium currents by regulating different aspects of channel function. Although β-GK binds to a conserved site within the α1-pore-forming subunit and facilitates channel opening, β-SH3 binds to dynamin and promotes endocytosis. Here, we investigated the molecular switch underlying the functional duality of this modular protein. We show that β-SH3 homodimerizes through a single disulfide bond.

In most prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes these two enzymes are encoded by separate genes, whereas in mammals they are expressed as a bifunctional gene product called UMP synthase (UMPS), with OPRT at the N terminus and OMPDC at the C terminus. Leishmania and some closely related organisms also express a bifunctional enzyme for these two steps, but the domain order is reversed relative to mammalian UMPS. In this work we demonstrate that L. donovani UMPS (LdUMPS) is an essential enzyme in promastigotes and that it is sequestered in the parasite glycosome. We also present the crystal structure of the LdUMPS in complex with its product, UMP. This structure reveals an unusual tetramer with two head to head and two tail to tail interactions, resulting in two dimeric OMPDC and two dimeric OPRT functional domains. In addition, we provide structural and biochemical evidence that oligomerization of LdUMPS is controlled by product binding at the OPRT active site. We propose a model for the assembly of the catalytically relevant LdUMPS tetramer and discuss the implications for the structure of mammalian UMPS.

https://openalex.org/W2011577679,"The plant VTC2 gene encodes GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in plant vitamin C biosynthesis. Genes encoding apparent orthologs of VTC2 exist in both mammals, which produce vitamin C by a distinct metabolic pathway, and in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans where vitamin C biosynthesis has not been demonstrated. We have now expressed cDNAs of the human and worm VTC2 homolog genes (C15orf58 and C10F3.4, respectively) and found that the purified proteins also display GDP-hexose phosphorylase activity. However, as opposed to the plant enzyme, the major reaction catalyzed by these enzymes is the phosphorolysis of GDP-D-glucose to GDP and D-glucose 1-phosphate. We detected activities with similar substrate specificity in worm and mouse tissue extracts. The highest expression of GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase was found in the nervous and male reproductive systems. A C. elegans C10F3.4 deletion strain was found to totally lack GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase activity; this activity was also found to be decreased in human HEK293T cells transfected with siRNAs against the human C15orf58 gene. These observations confirm the identification of the worm C10F3.4 and the human C15orf58 gene expression products as the GDP-D-glucose phosphorylases of these organisms. Significantly, we found an accumulation of GDP-D-glucose in the C10F3.4 mutant worms, suggesting that the GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase may function to remove GDP-D-glucose formed by GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase, an enzyme that has previously been shown to lack specificity for its physiological D-mannose 1-phosphate substrate. We propose that such removal may prevent the misincorporation of glucosyl residues for mannosyl residues into the glycoconjugates of worms and mammals."

FoxJ1−/− mice present with defects in odontogenesis, and we correlate these defects to hierarchical interactions between homeodomain factors Pitx2 and Dlx2 with FoxJ1 in regulating their expression through direct physical interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal endogenous Pitx2 and Dlx2 binding to the Dlx2 promoter and Dlx2 binding to the FoxJ1 promoter as well as Dlx2 and FoxJ1 binding to the amelogenin promoter. PITX2 activation of the Dlx2 promoter is attenuated by a direct Dlx2 physical interaction with PITX2. Dlx2 autoregulates its promoter, and Dlx2 transcriptionally activates the downstream gene FoxJ1.

These transcriptional mechanisms may contribute to other developmental processes such as neuronal, pituitary, and heart development. Tooth development provides an excellent model system to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating organogenesis. This process involves reciprocal interaction between the dental epithelium and the neural crest derived mesenchyme starting with the epithelial condensation and subsequent invagination into the mesenchyme (1Thesleff I. Sharpe P. Mech. Dev. 1997; 67: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Tooth morphogenesis is a complex process under a tight genetic control. The stages of tooth development and several epithelial-expressed transcription factors are shown in Fig. 1. A time line of selected epithelial transcription factors is also shown as a reference for the hierarchy of their expression. We previously demonstrated that FoxJ1 was expressed during tooth development at E14.5, 18.5, and post-natal day (P) 1 in both ameloblasts and odontoblasts (2Venugopalan S.R. Amen M.A. Wang J. Wong L.

FoxJ1 is a nuclear transcription factor, and it belongs to the winged-helix/fork-head family of transcription factors. It plays a fundamental role in embryonic development and differentiation (3Carlsson P. Mahlapuu M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In addition to the developing tooth germ, FoxJ1 is also expressed in the oral epithelium, salivary gland, airway epithelium, oviduct, spermatids, and choroid plexus (4Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G.

Pitx2 is specifically expressed in the stomatodeal ectoderm as early as day E8.5 and is the earliest transcription marker of tooth development (11Hjalt T.A. Semina E.V. Amendt B.A. Murray J.C. Dev.

With the expression of Pitx2, the stomatodeal ectoderm acquires the capacity to induce odontogenic properties in cranial neural crest. Pitx2 is specifically expressed in the dental epithelium throughout tooth development. Because Pitx2 is the earliest marker of tooth development, we hypothesize that Pitx2 regulates early signaling molecules and transcription factors required to regulate early and late stages of tooth development. Dlx2 is an orthologue of the Drosophila distal-less gene, which play a central role in patterning of jaws (18Thomas B.L. Porteus M.H. Rubenstein J.L. Sharpe P.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 32: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Thomas B.L. Tucker A.S. Qui M. Ferguson C.A. Hardcastle Z. Rubenstein J.L. Sharpe P.T.

During tooth development Dlx2 is expressed in the dental epithelial cells starting from the initiation, bud, cap, bell, and differentiation stages of tooth morphogenesis (20Thomas B.L. Liu J.K. Rubenstein J.L. Sharpe P.T. Development. 2000; 127: 217-224PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lézot F. Thomas B. Hotton D. Forest N. Orestes-Cardoso S. Robert B. Sharpe P. Berdal A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutants of Dlx2 exhibit abnormalities in the craniofacial and neuronal development (22Liu J.K. Ghattas I. Liu S. Chen S. Rubenstein J.L.R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 498-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Dlx1/Dlx2 mutants exhibit arrested maxillary molar development demonstrating their significance in tooth development (19Thomas B.L. Tucker A.S. Qui M. Ferguson C.A. Hardcastle Z. Rubenstein J.L. Sharpe P.T. Development. 1997; 124: 4811-4818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dlx2 expression occurs after Pitx2 and is a Pitx2 target gene. During late stages of tooth morphogenesis, the inner enamel epithelium-derived ameloblasts secrete the key enamel protein amelogenin (23Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Amelogenin lays down the enamel matrix, which later gets mineralized to form enamel. The promoter region of the amelogenin contained several binding sites for FoxJ1 and Dlx2. This led to our hypothesis that these two factors together regulate amelogenin gene expression. All these factors show a hierarchical expression pattern at specific time points during tooth development starting with Pitx2 and subsequently Dlx2, FoxJ1, and amelogenin. Interestingly, the DNA binding elements of these factors were found mutually in their own promoter regions and downstream genes. The aim of this study is to delineate the functional significance and identify how these genes are regulated in a hierarchical fashion. Our data reveal that PITX2 activates Dlx2, and Dlx2 physically interacts with PITX2 to repress PITX2 transcriptional activity. Interestingly, Dlx2 activates its own promoter and also activates the FoxJ1 promoter. Dlx2 and FoxJ1 physically interact and synergistically regulate the Dlx2 and FoxJ1 promoters. These two proteins also regulate amelogenin gene expression. The FoxJ1−/− mice show defects in ameloblast differentiation with decreased amelogenin expression. The FoxJ1 null mice reveal the biological role for FoxJ1 in regulating odontogenesis. These results provide new molecular mechanisms for the combinatorial activity of three major transcription factors in regulating gene expression through physical interactions and direct promoter activation. The ChIP assays were performed as previously described using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) with the following modifications (24Diamond E. Amen M. Hu Q. Espinoza H.M.

Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 m at 37 °C the next day. All PCR reactions were done under an annealing temperature of 58 °C. The sense primer (5′-GGAGGGAACCTCAGAATCAG-3′) and the antisense primer (5′-ACATCTCTTGTCCAACTTCGCC-3′) used to amplify the Dlx2 promoter are located at −716- and −326-bp regions of the distal promoter. Two primers for amplifying the Dlx2 binding site in the FoxJ1 promoter are as follows: sense (5′-GAGACCAAGAAGACTGAAGAGTTTG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGTATCTTCCTAACTGTGGACACC-3′). All the PCR products were evaluated on a 2% agarose gel in 1× Tris borate EDTA for appropriate size (267 bp) and confirmed by sequencing. The primers amplifying the FoxJ1 and Dlx2 binding site in the amelogenin promoter are as follows: sense (5′-GAGACGTCGACAATGGCATA-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTTGATCCGATGGTTTCTTC-3′) and sense (5′-GAATCTGGCATTGGTATGGTC-3′) and antisense (5′-ATCCAGTCGTTCCCAAACTG-3′), respectively. As controls the FoxJ1 primers were used without chromatin; normal goat IgG was used replacing the Dlx2 and FoxJ1 antibodies to reveal nonspecific immunoprecipitation of the chromatin. Primers upstream of the factor binding sites or to another gene promoter were used as controls. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or LS-8 (oral epithelial cells (26Chen L.S. Couwenhoven R.I. Hsu D. Luo W. Snead M.L. Arch. Oral Biol. 1992; 37: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin and transfected by electroporation. Cultures were fed 24 h before transfection, resuspended in PBS, and mixed with 2.5 μg of expression plasmids, 5 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of SV-40 β-galactosidase plasmid. Electroporation of CHO cells were performed at 380 V and 950 microfarads (Gene Pulser XL, Bio-Rad). Electroporation of LS-8 cells has been previously described (25Amen M. Liu X. Vadlamudi U. Elizondo G. Diamond E. Engelhardt J.F. Amendt B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7560-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h in 60-mm culture dishes and fed with 5% FBS and DMEM and then lysed and assayed for reporter activities and protein content by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase was measured using reagents from Promega. β-Galactosidase was measured using the Galacto-Light Plus reagents (Tropix Inc.). All luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Immobilized GST-PITX2, GST-PITX2 ΔN38, GST-PITX2 ΔC39, and GST-PITX2 C39 fusion proteins were suspended in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT with or without 1% milk and 400 μg/ml ethidium bromide). Purified bacteria expressed Dlx2 proteins (50–500 ng) were added to 10–30 μg of immobilized GST-PITX2 fusion proteins or GST in a total volume of 100 μl and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed 5 times with 200 μl of binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Approximately, 100 ng of purified Dlx2 proteins were analyzed in separate Western blots. After SDS gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to PVDF filters (Millipore), immunoblotted, and detected using PITX2 antibody (Capra Science) and ECL reagents from GE Healthcare. Approximately 24 h after cell transfection with Dlx2 and FoxJ1, CHO cells were rinsed with 1 ml of PBS and then incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. LS-8 oral epithelial cells were used to demonstrate endogenous Dlx2 and Pitx2 interaction. Cells were harvested and disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of lysate was saved for analysis as input control. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube on ice and precleared using the mouse IgG. Precleared lysate was incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Dlx2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The supernatant was incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C for overnight. Immunoprecipitates were collected by brief centrifugation and washed 2 times with PBS and resuspended in 15 μl of double-distilled H2O and 3 μl of 6× SDS loading dye. Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed with anti-FoxJ1 antibody and HRP-conjugated reagent to detect immunoprecipitated proteins. Steve Brody (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) kindly provided the FoxJ1−/− mice. All animals were housed in the Program of Animal Resources of the Institute of Biosciences and Technology and were handled in accordance with the principles and procedure of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the Texas A&M Health Science Center, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice carrying lacZ-PGKNeo cassette in FoxJ1 exon-1were mated to generate null alleles. Embryos were collected at various time points considering the day of observation of a vaginal plug to be embryonic day (E) 0.5. The primers used for genotyping were HGT 6F (5′-GCAGATGGAGAGAGGTGGAG-3′), HGT 7R (5′-TGGCGTTGAGAATGGAGAAT-3′), and HGT LacZ3 (5′-GACAGTATCGGCCTCAGGAA-3′). PCR, allele-specific amplification of genomic DNA isolated from mouse-tail, would generate a 470-bp wild-type (WT) or 524-bp mutant knock-out DNA product (27Brody S.L. Yan X.H. Wuerffel M.K. Song S.K. Shapiro S.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Embryos were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde and dehydrated with sequential concentration of alcohol and finally with xylene. The embryos were embedded in paraffin, and sections were made at 7-μm thickness. To examine tissue morphology, standard hematoxylin and eosin were used. For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized and treated with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer for 7.5 min at 100% power in a revolving 800-watt microwave and an additional 2 cycles of 5 min at 50% power. Subsequently, sections were treated with 4% hydrogen peroxide to block the endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were incubated with 5% goat serum for 30 min followed by overnight incubation with anti-amelogenin antibody at 1:500 dilution (Santa Cruz). After antibody incubation, the slides were treated with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) at a concentration of 1:200 for 30 min. Avidin biotin complex and DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories) were used as our reporting system. FoxJ1 shRNA was commercially purchased from S. A. BiosciencesA (SureSilencing shRNA Plasmid for FOXJ1, catalog #KH02286). The shRNA sequence was 5′-GCTACTGACAGCCTGGACTTT-3′. Endogenous Dlx2 activation was measured using sense (5′-GTAGCCTCATTTCTTGTTTTCCTCT-3′) and antisense (5′-ACTGTCAAAGACTCCAGTCATCCT-3′) primers. RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen. RT-PCRs were performed using iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit from Bio-Rad. Real-time PCRs were performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix kit, and all Ct values were normalized by β-actin level. All PCR products were examined by melt curves and sequenced. We have previously shown that PITX2 activates the Dlx2 promoter (28Green P.D. Hjalt T.A. Kirk D.E. Sutherland L.B. Thomas B.L. Sharpe P.T. Snead M.L. Murray J.C. Russo A.F. Amendt B.A. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we now demonstrate endogenous Pitx2 binding to the Dlx2 chromatin. ChIP were performed in LS-8 cells (an oral epithelial cell line (26Chen L.S. Couwenhoven R.I. Hsu D. Luo W. Snead M.L. Arch. Oral Biol. 1992; 37: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) as they endogenously express both Pitx2 and Dlx2. Pitx2 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the Pitx2/Dlx2 chromatin complex, and primers specifically flanking the Pitx2 binding site were used to amplify the chromatin (Fig. 2A). Normal rabbit IgG and nonspecific Msx2 promoter primers (−702 to −429) were used as negative controls in the Pitx2 immunoprecipitated chromatin complex. Dlx2 primers specific for Pitx2-binding site amplified the Pitx2-immunoprecipitated chromatin complex, demonstrating that Pitx2 binds to the Dlx2 promoter (Fig. 2B, lane 2). No amplification was detected in the Dlx2 primer-only and nonspecific control primers showing the specificity of the experiment (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 6). Also, the normal rabbit IgG immunoprecipitated chromatin did not yield a PCR product (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Chromatin input collected before the immunoprecipitation with Pitx2 antibody was amplified with Dlx2 primers and produced a PCR product showing the presence of chromatin in the starting material (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Preliminary data indicated that Dlx2 potentially autoregulated its promoter. Bioinformatic screens revealed several Dlx2 binding elements in the Dlx2 promoter, and a ChIP assay was performed using a Dlx2 antibody (Fig. 2, A and C). The Dlx2 antibody immunoprecipitated chromatin containing the Dlx2 binding site in the Dlx2 promoter (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Multiple controls were performed as in Fig. 2B and demonstrate the specificity of the ChIP assay. All PCR products were sequenced to confirm their identity. These results confirm that endogenous Pitx2 and Dlx2 bind to the Dlx2 promoter. Pitx2 and Dlx2 are homeodomain transcription factors and show an overlapping expression during craniofacial and brain development. To test the significance of Pitx2 and Dlx2 binding to the Dlx2 promoter, transient transfection assays were performed in CHO cells. PITX2A is a full-length construct, and PITX2A ΔN38 is a N-terminal deletion construct, whereas the PITX2A ΔT1261 is an Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome mutation and has a stop codon in the C-terminal OAR domain (29Espinoza H.M. Ganga M. Vadlamudi U. Martin D.M. Brooks B.P. Semina E.V. Murray J.C. Amendt B.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3942-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). PITX2A activated the Dlx2 promoter at ∼30-fold, and the PITX2A ΔN38 activated at ∼25-fold (Fig. 3B). Interestingly the PITX2A ΔT1261 activated the Dlx2 promoter at only ∼5-fold (Fig. 3B). Thus, the PITX2A N terminus had no effect on activation of the Dlx2 promoter; however, deletion of the PITX2 C-terminal tail OAR domain in the PITX2A ΔT1261 mutant had reduced activation. We have previously shown that the OAR domain is essential for PITX2 transcriptional activity and as a protein interaction domain (30Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Russo A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Dlx2 activates the Dlx2 promoter at 20-fold, demonstrating that Dlx2 can autoregulate its promoter (Fig. 3B). We asked if PITX2 and Dlx2 could work together to synergistically activate the Dlx2 promoter. Surprisingly, Dlx2 attenuated PITX2A activation from ∼30 to ∼14-fold (Fig. 3B). Dlx2 also reduced the activity of PITX2A ΔN38 from ∼25- to ∼10-fold (Fig. 3B). However, Dlx2 and PITX2A ΔT1261 activated the promoter at ∼30-fold, revealing no effect of Dlx2 attenuation with this construct (Fig. 3B). These experiments suggested that Dlx2 physically interacted with the PITX2A OAR domain to regulate transcription. To demonstrate endogenous activation of Dlx2 expression, CHO cells were transfected with PITX2 or Dlx2, and endogenous Dlx2 expression was measured by real time PCR. PITX2 activated Dlx2 expression ∼10-fold, and Dlx2 activated Dlx2 at ∼6-fold (Fig. 3C). To further demonstrate the PITX2 Dlx2 interaction, co-transfections were performed with the TK-Bic luciferase promoter (contains four PITX2 binding sites upstream of the TK 3The abbreviations used are: TKthymidine kinaseAmelxamelogeninAbameloblastOARotp, aristaless, and Rx. minimal promoter (30Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Russo A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) and PITX2 and/or Dlx2. PITX2 activated this promoter at 14-fold, whereas Dlx2 did not activate the promoter (Fig. 3D). However, Dlx2 attenuated PITX2 activation of this minimal promoter, demonstrating a direct repression of PITX2 transcriptional activity by Dlx2 (Fig. 3D). thymidine kinase amelogenin ameloblast otp, aristaless, and Rx. A GST pulldown assay was performed to determine whether Dlx2 directly interacted with PITX2A. Dlx2 (300 ng) was incubated with immobilized GST-PITX2, GST-PITX2 ΔN38 (N-terminal deletion of PITX2), GST-PITX2 ΔC39 (C-terminal 39 amino acids deletion), and GST-PITX2 C39 (C-terminal 39 amino acids) in one reaction (Fig. 4A). After incubation, each aliquot was extensively washed and resolved separately on a polyacrylamide gel probing for Dlx2 (Fig. 4B). Dlx2 bound to PITX2, PITX2 ΔN38, and PITX2 C39, but it did not interact with PITX2 ΔC39 (Fig. 4B). Dlx2 interacts specifically with the last 39 amino acids of the PITX2 C-terminal tail containing the OAR domain. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using a Dlx2 antibody to immunoprecipitate the Dlx2-PITX2A complex in transfected CHO cell lysates confirmed the interaction of Dlx2 and PITX2 (Fig. 4C). Endogenous Dlx2 and Pitx2 interactions are shown using LS-8 cells without transfected factors (Fig. 4D). We have previously identified FoxJ1 as a new factor in craniofacial and tooth development (2Venugopalan S.R. Amen M.A. Wang J. Wong L. Cavender A.C. D'Souza R.N. Akerlund M. Brody S.L. Hjalt T.A. Amendt B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3643-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); however, the factors regulating FoxJ1 expression during the late stages of tooth development are not known. Sequence analysis revealed a Dlx2 consensus binding site (CAATTA) in the FoxJ1 promoter (Fig. 5A). ChIP assays were performed in LS-8 cells, as both factors are endogenously expressed in these cells. Dlx2 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the Dlx2-FoxJ1 chromatin complex. FoxJ1 primers designed specifically for the region flanking the Dlx2 binding site located at −1779 and −1774 bp were used to amplify the chromatin (Fig. 5A). Dlx2 immunoprecipitated the FoxJ1 chromatin complex, and the primers yielded a PCR product of 262 bp (Fig. 5B, lane 3). However, the FoxJ1 primers only and chromatin-immunoprecipitated with goat immunoglobulin (IgG control) did not yield a PCR product (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). All PCR products were sequenced to confirm their identity. Because the ChIP assays demonstrated that endogenous Dlx2 bound to the FoxJ1 promoter, we asked if Dlx2 could transcriptionally regulate the promoter. We co-transfected the FoxJ1 2.6-kb promoter with Dlx2 and/or FoxJ1 plasmids into CHO cells. Dlx2 by itself activated the FoxJ1 promoter at ∼12-fold, and FoxJ1 activated its promoter at low levels (Fig. 5C). However, co-expression of FoxJ1 with Dlx2 synergistically activated the FoxJ1 promoter at ∼45-fold (Fig. 5C). Lef-1 transfection was used as a control. To demonstrate that the Dlx2 synergistic interaction with FoxJ1 was due to protein interactions and not independent DNA binding activities, transfection experiments were repeated using a TK-Luc reporter with three Fox binding sites cloned upstream of the TK minimal promoter. FoxJ1 activated the TK-Fox promoter at ∼13-fold, whereas Dlx2 did not activate the reporter (Fig. 5D). Co-transfection of FoxJ1 with Dlx2 increased FoxJ1 activation of TK-Fox to ∼25-fold (Fig. 5D). As controls, the Fox binding sites were mutated in the TK-Fox reporter (TK-MutFox), which abolished activation by FoxJ1 (Fig. 5D). Because Dlx2 and FoxJ1 synergistically activated the FoxJ1 promoter, we asked if these proteins would also synergistically regulate the Dlx2 promoter in a similar fashion. We co-transfected the Dlx2 promoter with Dlx2 and/or the FoxJ1 plasmids into CHO cells (Fig. 6A). Dlx2 by itself activated the Dlx-2 promoter at ∼20-fold, whereas FoxJ1 activated the promoter minimally at ∼5-fold (Fig. 6A). As expected, Dlx2 and FoxJ1 synergistically activated the Dlx2 promoter at ∼40-fold, confirming their synergistic activity with another promoter construct (Fig. 6A). These data reveal that Dlx2 not only autoregulates its activity; it can also synergize with FoxJ1 to increase activation of the Dlx2 and FoxJ1 promoters. Lef-1 transfection was used as a control. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to determine whether Dlx2 and FoxJ1 physically interact. CHO cells were transfected with an empty vector, Dlx2, and/or FoxJ1 plasmids. Dlx2 antibody did not immunoprecipitate the Dlx2-FoxJ1 complex in the transfected empty vector (mock), Dlx2 plasmid only, or the FoxJ1 plasmid only cell lysates (Fig. 6B, lanes 2–4). However, when Dlx2 and FoxJ1 were co-transfected, Dlx2 formed a complex with FoxJ1 and was immunoprecipitated by Dlx2 antibody (Fig. 6B, lane 5). To demonstrate the expression of FoxJ1, the cell lysates were directly analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 6B, lanes 6 and 7, Input). 100 ng of FoxJ1 pure protein was used as Western blot control (Fig. 6B, lane 1). This co-immunoprecipitation data corroborates the transfection data, demonstrating that these two proteins can physically interact to form a complex and regulate gene expression. It has been previously reported that Dlx2 may regulate amelogenin and control enamel formation during tooth development (31Lézot F. Thomas B. Greene S.R. Hotton D. Yuan Z.A. Castaneda B. Bolaños A. Depew M. Sharpe P. Gibson C.W. Berdal A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 216: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We asked if FoxJ1 and Dlx2 directly regulated the Amelx promoter. ChIP assays were performed in LS-8 cells and demonstrated that both endogenous FoxJ1 and Dlx2 bound to the Amelx promoter. FoxJ1 bound to a FoxJ1 element in the Amelx promoter at −189 to −196 bp (Fig. 7, A and B). The FoxJ1 antibody immunoprecipitated chromatin corresponding to the Amelx promoter and FoxJ1 binding site (Fig. 7B, left panel). Controls included the IgG control and primers to an upstream region of the Amelx promoter that does not contain a FoxJ1 DNA binding site, −6473 to −6735 (Fig. 7B, right panel). A Dlx2 antibody immunoprecipitated chromatin containing the FoxJ1 binding site, demonstrating that Dlx2 interacts with FoxJ1 bound to chromatin (Fig. 7B, middle panel). ChIP assays demon"
https://openalex.org/W2015205925,"The antibiotic microcin C7 (McC) acts as a bacteriocide by inhibiting aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and stalling the protein translation machinery. McC is synthesized as a heptapeptide-nucleotide conjugate, which is processed by cellular peptidases within target strains to yield the biologically active compound. As unwanted processing of intact McC can result in self-toxicity, producing strains utilize multiple mechanisms for autoimmunity against processed McC. We have shown previously that the mccE gene within the biosynthetic cluster can inactivate processed McC by acetylating the antibiotic. Here, we present the characterization of this acetylation mechanism through biochemical and structural biological studies of the MccE acetyltransferase domain (MccE(AcTase)). We have also determined five crystal structures of the MccE-acetyl-CoA complex with bound substrates, inhibitor, and reaction product. The structural data reveal an unexpected mode of substrate recognition through π-stacking interactions similar to those found in cap-binding proteins and nucleotidyltransferases. These studies provide a rationale for the observation that MccE(AcTase) can detoxify a range of aminoacylnucleotides, including those that are structurally distinct from microcin C7."

Consequently, the enzymes involved in MSH biosynthesis are targets for drug development. The metal-dependent enzyme N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside deacetylase (MshB) catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside to form 1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside and acetate, the fourth overall step in MSH biosynthesis. Inhibitors of metalloenzymes typically contain a group that binds to the active site metal ion; thus, a comprehensive understanding of the native cofactor(s) of metalloenzymes is critical for the development of biologically effective inhibitors. Herein, we examined the effect of metal ions on the overall activity of MshB and probed the identity of the native cofactor. We found that the activity of MshB follows the trend Fe2+ > Co2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+ and Ni2+. Additionally, our results show that the identity of the cofactor bound to purified MshB is highly dependent on the purification conditions used (aerobic versus anaerobic), as well as the metal ion content of the medium during protein expression. MshB prefers Fe2+ under anaerobic conditions regardless of the metal ion content of the medium and switches between Fe2+ and Zn2+ under aerobic conditions as the metal content of the medium is altered. These results indicate that the cofactor bound to MshB under biological conditions is dependent on environmental conditions, suggesting that MshB may be a cambialistic metallohydrolase that contains a dynamic cofactor.

MshB is an attractive drug target because it is a metalloenzyme; there are past successes in targeting metalloenzymes, including inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, matrix metalloproteases, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (12Supuran C.T.

Inhibitors of metalloenzymes typically contain a group that binds to the catalytic metal ion. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of metalloenzyme cofactor preferences is necessary for the development of potent and specific metalloenzyme inhibitors. MshB was previously identified as a Zn2+-dependent enzyme based on the observations that the enzyme copurifies with Zn2+ (Fig. 1B) and that the enzyme activity is reversibly inhibited by treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline (16Newton G.L. Ko M. Ta P. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Steffek M. Newton G.L. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C.

On the basis of the structure of the enzyme active site, MshB is thought to catalyze the hydrolysis of GlcNAc-Ins via one of two potential chemical mechanisms using general acid-base catalysis (GABC) (19Hernick M. Fierke C.A. Mander L.N. Lui H.-W.B. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Oxford, UK2010: 547-581Google Scholar). One possible mechanism uses a single bifunctional GABC to facilitate the hydrolysis of GlcNAc-Ins, whereas the other uses a GABC pair to carry out this reaction. However, Fe2+ was not examined as a potential cofactor in these experiments. Furthermore, MshB was purified using zinc immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) under aerobic conditions, which is biased toward zinc incorporation into metalloenzymes (16Newton G.L. Ko M. Ta P. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified MshB contains nickel (0.82 eq) when purified using nickel IMAC (aerobic conditions) (16Newton G.L. Ko M. Ta P. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Protein Expr.

There have been several examples over the last decade of Fe2+-enzymes being misidentified as exclusive Zn2+-enzymes, including peptide deformylase, S-ribosylhomocysteinase (LuxS), UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC), and possibly histone deacetylase-8 (HDAC8) (20Groche D.

In all these enzymes, the Fe2+ cofactor is either exclusively preferred or is preferred over Zn2+ under certain environmental conditions. The incorporation of Zn2+ into these enzymes that led to the initial characterizations as zinc-enzymes is attributed to purification of the enzymes under aerobic conditions, which leads to oxidation of Fe2+, dissociation of Fe3+ from the enzyme, and replacement with Zn2+. The finding that the zinc ion observed in the crystal structure of MshB is a 5-coordinate metal ion (28Maynes J.T. Garen C. Cherney M.M. Newton G. Arad D. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47166-47170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) suggests that Fe2+ could also possibly serve as a cofactor for MshB because Fe2+ prefers coordination numbers of 5–6 (19Hernick M. Fierke C.A. Mander L.N. Lui H.-W.B. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Oxford, UK2010: 547-581Google Scholar). Consequently, we have examined whether Fe2+ can serve as an efficient cofactor for MshB. Herein, we demonstrate that the activity of MshB is ∼3-fold higher with Fe2+ as a cofactor compared with Zn2+. The activity of Fe2+-MshB is air-sensitive, whereas the activity of Zn2+-MshB is stable under aerobic conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate that MshB preferentially binds Fe2+ over Zn2+ when purified under anaerobic conditions and when purified under aerobic conditions in the absence of added Zn2+. Although MshB exhibits a higher affinity for Zn2+ over Fe2+, it is likely that higher free [Fe2+] accounts for the cofactor preferences that are observed in these experiments. These results suggest that MshB likely uses Fe2+ and Zn2+ as biological cofactors under different environmental conditions. These results may have important biological implications in light of the dynamic changes in zinc and iron concentrations that occur during the course of infection and suggest that biologically effective inhibitors will need to dually target Fe2+-MshB and Zn2+-MshB. All solutions were prepared using Milli-Q water. Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Genomic DNA was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. DNA sequencing was performed at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute DNA Sequencing Facility (Virginia Tech). Plasmids and PCR products were purified using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification system and Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up kits (Promega), respectively. All chemicals were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sigma, and Gold Biotechnology. For all kinetic and thermodynamic experiments, solutions were prepared with reagents that did not contain extraneous metal ions and/or were treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad), and solutions were stored in “metal-free” plasticware. For Fe2+ experiments, a 400 mm FeCl2 stock was prepared in 10 mm dithionite and diluted to 100 mm with 1× assay buffer prior to incubation with apo-MshB. Similarly, a 100 mm ZnSO4 solution was prepared in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and diluted to 100 mm with 1× assay buffer prior to incubation with apo-MshB. To maintain anaerobic conditions, experiments were carried out either in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI) and/or using assay buffers containing 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and completed in <2 h to ensure that MshB was maximally active during the course of the assays. The concentrations of metal ions were measured by ion chromatography on a Dionex ICS-3000 system. The mshB genes from Mycobacterium smegmatis (Ms) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) were cloned into expression vectors using Flexi® technology (Promega). The expression plasmids used in these studies yield recombinant proteins containing an N-terminal affinity tag linked to MshB via a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site: pVP55A (His tag) (29Sobrado P. Goren M.A. James D. Amundson C.K. Fox B.G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 58: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), pVP56K (His-maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag) (30Blommel P.G. Fox B.G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 55: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and pFN18K (HaloTag, Promega). The mshB genes were amplified from genomic DNA with PmeI and SgfI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. PCR products were digested with Flexi enzyme blend (PmeI and SgfI) and ligated into Flexi-digested expression plasmids with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). For MtMshB, which contains an internal SgfI site, the PCR product was first ligated into a pZeroBlunt vector (Stratagene), the internal restriction site was removed by introducing a silent mutation using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mshB gene was liberated by Flexi digest prior to ligation into the Flexi-digested pVP55A, pVP56K, and pFN18K vectors. The plasmid sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. For large-scale production of recombinant proteins, the pHis-MsMshB or pHisMBP-MtMshB plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm) until an A600 of ∼0.6 was reached. Protein expression was induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the temperature was decreased to 25 °C, and the cells were incubated with shaking overnight. After 4–14 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in Buffer A (30 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm imidazole (pH 7.5)), and stored at −80 °C. Cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C3 high-pressure homogenizer (Avestin). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (18,000 rpm, 4 °C) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (Buffer A) cobalt or nickel IMAC column (50 ml of chelating Sepharose (GE Healthcare) charged with NiCl2 or CoCl2). MshB was purified at 4 °C. The column was washed with 150 ml of Buffer A, and His-MshB or His-MBP-MshB was eluted using an imidazole step gradient (200 ml each of Buffer A + 10 mm imidazole, Buffer A + 25 mm imidazole, and Buffer A + 300 mm imidazole). Fractions containing His-MshB or His-MBP-MshB (via SDS-PAGE) were combined, concentrated (Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal devices, Millipore), and dialyzed (SnakeSkin tubing, Mr cutoff of 10,000, Pierce) versus 2 × 4 liters of Buffer A overnight in the presence of His-TEV protease (300 μg/ml) to remove the His or His-MBP tag. The resulting TEV-cleaved protein was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (Buffer A + 25 mm imidazole) cobalt or nickel IMAC column. His-MBP and His-TEV remain bound to the cobalt IMAC column, whereas MshB eluted in the flow-through fraction. Fractions containing MshB (via 12% SDS-PAGE) were combined, concentrated, and dialyzed versus 2 × 4 liters of 25 mm HEPES and 1.5 mm TCEP (pH 7.5) (Slide-A-Lyzer, Mr cutoff of 10,000, Pierce). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Assay (Pierce or Sigma). Protein aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein identity was confirmed via mass spectroscopy (by Keith Ray and Rich Helm, Virginia Tech) following digest with trypsin and peptide sequencing (MALDI-TOF/TOF). The resulting peptide sequences were analyzed using Matrix Science Mascot and confirmed the identity of MshB from M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, respectively, with peptide sequence coverage of 33% (MsMshB) and 44% (MtMshB). Sequences are provided in supplemental Fig. S1. The solution molecular weight of MshB was examined using size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S2) (31Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (3069) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The elution volumes were used to calculate the Kav values (Kav = (Ve − V0)/(Vt − V0), where V0 is the void volume of the column, Vt is the total volume of the column, and Ve is the elution volume of the protein). A standard curve was prepared by plotting log Mr versus Kav using the following protein standards (GE Healthcare): aprotinin (6.5 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and conalbumin (75 kDa). As purified, MshB contains bound metal ions, and the metal ion content of purified MshB varies depending on the nature of the purification used (supplemental Table S1). Consequently, for our studies, we prepared apo-MshB and then selectively reconstituted the enzyme with the desired metal ions. For the preparation of apo-MshB, purified protein (≤100 μm) was incubated with 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm dipicolinic acid, and 250 μm EDTA (pH 7.5) on ice. After 1 h, the protein solution was concentrated, washed (diluted with buffer and then concentrated) with 3 × 15 ml of 25 mm HEPES and 1.5 mm TCEP (pH 7.5), and run over a desalting column to remove residual dipicolinic acid/EDTA. Metal ion concentrations were determined using the ICS-3000 system. Apo-MshB samples contained ≤10% metal/protein (supplemental Table S2). Prior to activity measurements, apo-MshB (≤10 μm) was incubated with a stoichiometric concentration of the desired metal ion (CoCl2, FeCl2, FeCl3, MnCl2, NiCl2, or ZnSO4) and incubated on ice for 30 min. For experiments examining the optimal metal/protein ratio, apo-MshB was incubated with various concentrations of the desired metal ion (0–20 μm) for 30 min on ice prior to activity assay. MshB deacetylase activity was measured with the substrate GlcNAc (Sigma) using a fluorescamine-based assay (32Huang X. Hernick M. Anal. Biochem. 2011; 414: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In general, assay mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), and 0–150 mm GlcNAc were pre-equilibrated at 30 °C, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (1 μm). For pH dependence experiments, the following buffers (all 50 mm containing 1 mm TCEP) were used: MES (pH 6–6.8), MOPS (pH 6.5–7.5), HEPES (pH 7.3–8.8), N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (pH 8–9), borate (pH 9–10), and carbonate (pH 10–11). After incubation for various times, reactions aliquots (30 μl) were quenched by the addition of 20% TCA (10 μl), and the cleared supernatant (25 μl) was transferred into a 96-well plate, diluted with 75 μl of 1 m borate (pH 9), and reacted with fluorescamine (30 μl in CH3CN, Invitrogen). After 10 min, the fluorescence was measured (excitation, 395 nm; emission, 485 nm) using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). The initial rates of product formation (<10%) were determined from these data. Equation 1 was fit to the pH-rate profile, where k1 represents V/K at the pH optimum, and Ka1 and Ka2 represent the dissociation constants describing the two ionizations.V/Kobs=k1(1+[H+]Ka1+Ka2[H+])Eq. 1 For determination of the steady-state parameters, deacetylase activity was measured at six to eight different concentrations of GlcNAc (0–150 mm), and the parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were obtained by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the initial linear velocities using the curve-fitting program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software), which also calculates the asymptotic standard errors. Apo-MsMshB (1 μm) was incubated with 1 μm FeCl2 or ZnSO4 in an anaerobic glove box in 50 mm HEPES and 10 mm TCEP (pH 7.5) for 30 min on ice to reconstitute the holoenzyme. The enzyme solutions were transferred to sealed anaerobic cuvettes (Precision Cells), and the UV-visible spectrum was recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The spectrum of the Zn2+-MshB sample was subtracted from Fe2+-MshB to account for background absorbance attributed to the protein. The absorbance difference spectrum for Fe2+-MshB is shown in supplemental Fig. S4. BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pHalo-MshB and grown in chemically defined medium (100 ml) (33Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm) until an A600 of ∼0.6 was reached. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside along with the addition of no added metals, 20 μm ZnSO4, 20 μm ferric ammonium citrate, or both metal supplements, and the cells were incubated overnight (12–14 h) with shaking (250 rpm) at 25 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 1 × 10 ml of 5 mm CaCl2 and 2 × 10 ml of 10 mm MOPS (pH 7). Cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of pulldown buffer (40 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm TCEP (pH 7.5)) and lysed by incubation with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) at room temperature for 15–30 min. For anaerobic experiments, washed cell pellets were transferred into an anaerobic chamber prior to resuspension in pulldown buffer. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 25–30 min) and then incubated with 150 μl of HaloLinkTM resin (pre-equilibrated in pulldown buffer, Promega) for 30 min. HaloLinkTM resin was washed with pulldown buffer (5 × 500 μl), resuspended in 250 μl of pulldown buffer containing TEV protease (5 units/μl), and incubated at 37 °C for 45–60 min. The TEV protease expressed and purified in our laboratory was dialyzed against an EDTA-containing buffer and therefore has a low metal content (<0.001 metal ion/protein). Cleaved MshB was separated from the resin by centrifugation (13,200 rpm, 2 min). The concentrations of metal ions were determined using the ICS-3000 system, and the concentration of MshB was determined using the Bradford assay. The affinity of MshB for Zn(II) was determined using ultrafiltration as described for LpxC deacetylase (27Gattis S.G. Hernick M. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33788-33796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, apo-MshB (1 μm) was incubated in a metal ion and pH buffer containing 1 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 5 mm MOPS (pH 7), and 0–0.5 mm total zinc (0–3.3 nm free zinc) at 30 °C for ≥25 min. Free and bound metal ions were separated by centrifugation (1500 relative centrifugal force, 5 min), and the concentration of metal ions (filtrate and retentate) was determined using ion chromatography. The KDZn(II) value was determined by fitting a binding isotherm to these data. The affinity of MshB for Fe(II) was determined by measuring the catalytic activity of MshB in the presence of varying concentrations of free Fe(II). Apo-MshB (1 μm) was incubated in a metal ion and pH buffer containing 1 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 5 mm MOPS (pH 7), and 0–950 μm total Fe(II) (0–2.6 μm free Fe(II)) at 30 °C for ≥30 min in an anaerobic chamber. Activity assays were carried out as described above using 50 mm GlcNAc and 1 μm MshB. The KDFe(II) value was determined by fitting a binding isotherm to these data. The first-order rate constant for metal ion dissociation from MshB was measured by determining the time-dependent loss of activity upon incubation of MshB with the chelator EDTA. Zn2+-MshB or Fe2+-MshB (50 μm) was diluted into assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP (pH 7.5)) containing 1 mm EDTA and incubated at 30 °C. After various times (0–200 min), an aliquot of enzyme was diluted 100-fold into assay buffer containing 20 mm GlcNAc, and the activity was measured as described above. A single exponential decay was fit to the initial rates as a function of time to obtain the koff value. MshB was previously shown to undergo reversible inhibition by treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline, demonstrating that MshB is a metalloenzyme (16Newton G.L. Ko M. Ta P. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Maynes J.T. Garen C. Cherney M.M. Newton G. Arad D. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47166-47170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, determination of whether MshB is a mononuclear or binuclear metalloenzyme was not examined. Because Zn2+ is proposed to be the native cofactor for MshB, we examined the effect of varying the Zn2+/MshB ratio on catalytic activity (Fig. 2A). The results from these experiments demonstrate that MshB was maximally active with ∼1 Zn2+ ion/MshB, indicating that MshB is a mononuclear metalloenzyme. This finding is consistent with the crystal structure of MshB that reveals a single bound zinc ion in the active site (Fig. 1B) (28Maynes J.T. Garen C. Cherney M.M. Newton G. Arad D. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47166-47170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Experiments on the titration of Fe2+ and Co2+ with MshB are also consistent with a mononuclear metalloenzyme (supplemental Fig. S3). The MshB-catalyzed reaction (V/K conditions) exhibits a bell-shaped dependence on pH, indicating that there are two ionizations that are important for maximal catalytic activity (Fig. 2B) with observed pKa values of 7.3 and 10.4 for Zn2+-MshB. These results are consistent with MshB proceeding through either a single bifunctional GABC or a GABC pair mechanism, as observed for other metal-dependent deacetylases (19Hernick M. Fierke C.A. Mander L.N. Lui H.-W.B. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Oxford, UK2010: 547-581Google Scholar). In previous experiments, the steady-state parameters for Zn2+-MshB were determined using the substrates GlcNAc-Ins, monobromobimane S-conjugated MSH, and bimane S-conjugated Cys-GlcN-Ins (16Newton G.L. Ko M. Ta P. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although it was stated that the activity of apo-MshB could be restored with Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, or Co2+, no specific values for the rate enhancements observed were reported, and the steady-state parameters for MshB activity were provided only for Zn2+-MshB. Because information about the chemical mechanism can be gained from the relative changes in activity upon reconstitution with different metal ions and Fe2+ had not been previously examined as a potential cofactor, we determined the steady-state parameters for MshB substituted with different metal ions (Fig. 2C and Table 1). We chose to use the commercially available substrate GlcNAc in these experiments. GlcNAc has a weakened affinity for MshB compared with GlcNAc-Ins; however, the group that undergoes hydrolysis in these two substrates is the same (16Newton G.L. Ko M. Ta P. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C.

https://openalex.org/W1968595448,"The lipocalin mouse 24p3 has been implicated in diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis, iron trafficking, development and innate immunity. Studies from our laboratory as well as others demonstrated the proapoptotic activity of 24p3 in a variety of cultured models. However, a general role for the lipocalin 24p3 in the hematopoietic system has not been tested in vivo. To study the role of 24p3, we derived 24p3 null mice and back-crossed them onto C57BL/6 and 129/SVE backgrounds. Homozygous 24p3−/− mice developed a progressive accumulation of lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid cells, which was not due to enhanced hematopoiesis because competitive repopulation and recovery from myelosuppression were the same as for wild type. Instead, apoptotic defects were unique to many mature hematopoietic cell types, including neutrophils, cytokine-dependent mast cells, thymocytes, and erythroid cells. Thymocytes isolated from 24p3 null mice also displayed resistance to apoptosis-induced by dexamethasone. Bim response to various apoptotic stimuli was attenuated in 24p3−/− cells, thus explaining their resistance to the ensuing cell death. The results of these studies, in conjunction with those of previous studies, reveal 24p3 as a regulator of the hematopoietic compartment with important roles in normal physiology and disease progression. Interestingly, these functions are limited to relatively mature blood cell compartments.

The results of these studies, in conjunction with those of previous studies, reveal 24p3 as a regulator of the hematopoietic compartment with important roles in normal physiology and disease progression. Interestingly, these functions are limited to relatively mature blood cell compartments. Lipocalins are a family of secreted proteins that can bind small molecular weight ligands (1Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 2Akerstrom B. Flower D.R. Salier J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and have diverse molecular recognition properties and functions (reviewed in Ref. 1Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). The lipocalin mouse 24p3 (also called lipocalin 2 (LCN2)) can mediate either apoptosis or iron uptake in cells expressing the 24p3 cell surface receptor, 24p3R (also called SLC22A17) (3Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The ability of 24p3 to induce either apoptosis or iron uptake depends upon its iron status. Iron-loaded 24p3 binds to 24p3R, is internalized, and releases its bound iron, thereby increasing intracellular iron concentration without promoting apoptosis. By contrast, following association with an intracellular siderophore, iron-lacking 24p3 chelates iron and transfers it to the extracellular medium, thereby reducing intracellular iron concentration, which induces expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim, resulting in apoptosis (3Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In addition, agents that reduce intracellular iron levels increase Bim expression. Most importantly, intracellular iron delivery blocks induction of Bim expression and apoptosis resulting from the loss of IL-3, the addition of 24p3, or an iron chelator. Therefore, induction of Bim in response to decreased intracellular iron levels is an important aspect of 24p3-induced cell death, and it is required for apoptosis resulting from the addition of 24p3 (3Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the withdrawal of interleukin-3 (IL-3) induces expression of 24p3 in IL-3-dependent murine pro-B lymphocytic FL5.12 cells and that conditioned medium (CM) from IL-3-deprived FL5.12 cells contains 24p3 and induces apoptosis in naive FL5.12 cells (4Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Moreover, 24p3 induces apoptosis in a variety of hematopoietic cells. Based upon these results, we have proposed that IL-3 withdrawal results in 24p3 transcription, leading to synthesis and secretion of 24p3, which induces apoptosis in cells expressing 24p3R through an autocrine/paracrine pathway. To study the biological functions of 24p3 in a more physiological context, we have generated mutant mice bearing a homozygous deletion in the 24p3 gene. Our data demonstrate a critical role for 24p3 in diverse apoptotic pathways that are relevant to hematopoietic cells. Remarkably, 24p3 was uniquely required for maintenance of survival in committed hematopoietic cells and was not essential for early hematopoiesis. 129/SVE embryonic stem cells were electroporated with a linearized targeting construct in which exons 1–5 of the 24p3 gene were replaced with a phosphoglycerol kinase-neomycin cassette; the construct contained 1.8 kb of 5′-flanking and 3.5 kb of 3′-flanking sequence homology. Following transfection, embryonic stem cells were selected with G418 (Invitrogen) and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil for 14 days. Recombinants were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis with BamHI-digested genomic DNA hybridized to an external probe. Positive clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Germ line-transmitting male chimeric mice were intercrossed with female C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygous F1 progeny, which were then intercrossed to derive 24p3−/− mice. The resulting hybrids were successively back-crossed for at least six generations to either 129/SVE or C57BL/6 wild type mice (Jackson Laboratories). Routine genotype analysis of offspring was carried out by multiplex PCR analysis of genomic DNA obtained from tail snips using primers P1 (5′-TGTACTGGCAATTACTTCATGGCTTCC-3′), P2 (5′-CAGGGATCAAGTTCTGAGTTGAGTCC-3′), and P3 (5′-TATGGCTTCTGAGGCGGAAAGAACC-3′). Immunoblot analysis of proteins extracted from concentrated urine samples of 24p3+/+, 24p3+/−, and 24p3−/− mice was performed using an anti-24p3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Bone marrow cells were flushed from femora and tibia of 8–12-week-old mice, and total cellularity was enumerated by hemocytometer. To assess cell composition, bone marrow cells were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies against Gr-1, Mac-1, B220, or Ter-119 (BD Biosciences or eBioscience) or matching isotype control antibodies (BD Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% bovine serum albumin for 20 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice and fixed in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde (Sigma). Labeled cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur or FACScan cytometer at the UMMS Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory or Case Flow Cytometry Core Facility and analyzed using CellQuest and FlowJo software. For peripheral blood analysis, total leukocyte counts were performed using the Unopette system (BD Biosciences), and differential leukocyte counts were determined by staining with Diff-Quick (Dade-Behring). Hematological parameters were determined using a Hemavet 950FS apparatus (Drew Scientific). Single cell suspensions of spleen were made by mincing the spleen tissue and straining the minced tissue through a 40-μm sieve (BD Biosciences). The spleen total cellularity was enumerated by hemocytometer. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. In some experiments, mice were treated with 200 mg/kg 5-FU to induce myelosuppression. On day 7 following treatment, blood counts were analyzed by a hematology analyzer, bone marrow total cellularity was counted by a hematocytometer, and the c-kit-positive, lineage-negative, and sca-1-positive (KLS) fraction of cells was determined by flow cytometry. Bone marrow cells were isolated as described above and cultured in the presence of a cytokine mixture comprising 20 ng/ml IL-3 and 50 ng/ml each IL-6, IL-7, and stem cell factor (all from Peprotech), and at various time points the total cell counts and cell subset composition were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. For spontaneous apoptosis assays, cultured Gr-1+ bone marrow cells were stained with annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by FACS. 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 9% casein (Sigma), and 8 h later, mice were sacrificed, and the blood was drawn from the retro-orbital plexus into heparinized tubes. Peritoneal cells were harvested into 5 ml of PBS plus 1% BSA, washed, layered onto a three-step Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient (1.07, 1.06, and 1.05 g/ml), and centrifuged at 400 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C (5Dong X. Mo Z. Bokoch G. Guo C. Li Z. Wu D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1874-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The neutrophil band was aspirated, the total number was determined by hemocytometer, and the neutrophil purity was determined by FACS analysis using a Gr-1 antibody. Cells were suspended at 106 cells/ml in PBS plus 1% BSA. Elicited polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) 4The abbreviations used are: PMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyteG-CSFgranulocyte colony-stimulating factorBMMCbone marrow-derived mast cellGCglucocorticoidDexdexamethasone5-FU5-fluorouracil. from mice (n = 5) were pooled for further analysis. Unelicited bone marrow PMNs were obtained by flushing cells from femora of 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice (n = 5) and centrifugation through Percoll as described above. PMNs in peripheral blood were separated by lysing RBC with a lysis buffer (Gentra Systems). The percentage of PMNs in peripheral blood was determined by Gr-1 staining. To determine neutrophil apoptosis, elicited PMNs from 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (25 ng/ml, Peprotech) for the indicated time periods. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V-FITC staining. polymorphonuclear leukocyte granulocyte colony-stimulating factor bone marrow-derived mast cell glucocorticoid dexamethasone 5-fluorouracil. Bone marrow cells (4 × 105) were isolated as described above and cultured in medium containing 0.9% methylcellulose (Methocult M3234, Stem Cell Technology) in IMDM supplemented with 1% BSA, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 15% FBS, 10 mg/ml bovine pancreatic insulin, 200 mg/ml holotransferrin (all from Invitrogen), and 10 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-3 or 100 ng/ml G-CSF (Peprotech). Colonies were counted 7–10 days postculture. IL-3-responsive primary cells were derived from bone marrow as described previously (6Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. López-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Mekori Y.A. Oh C.K. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3775-3784PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were aseptically flushed from femora of 8–12-week-old 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− mice (n = 3) into RPMI medium containing 10% FBS. Red blood cells were lysed with a lysis solution (Gentra Systems), and unlysed cells were washed three times with RPMI plus 10% FBS. Cells were then suspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 3 ng/ml IL-3 (Peprotech), 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Two days later, the non-adherent cells were collected and cultured for an additional 14 days in the above medium with periodic changes of medium. The culture was then enriched in IL-3-responsive mast cells as judged by toluidine blue staining (>90% positive) and surface staining with CD34, Fc∈RI, and c-Kit antibodies coupled to fluorochromes (BD Biosciences). To determine apoptosis, cells were washed three times with RPMI and 10% FBS (lacking IL-3) and recultured in the wash medium. Cell death was then determined by annexin V-FITC staining (BD Biosciences). Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in CD34-gated or ungated cells. Cells were supplemented with exogenous iron by the addition of 50 μm FeCl3 (Sigma). CM was prepared as described previously (4Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated thymocytes from 6–8-week-old 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− mice were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma). The percentage of apoptosis was determined by annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences) staining. For in vivo experiments, 8–12-week-old 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with 125 mg of dexamethasone dissolved in normal saline containing 20 mg/ml propylene glycol (EMD Sciences) or with normal saline as control. Thymi, spleens, and bone marrow samples were harvested 20 h postinjection, and the total cellularity was enumerated by hemocytometer. Single cell suspensions from bone marrow, spleen, and thymus were surface-stained with CD4 or CD8 antibodies conjugated to FITC or PE (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Bone marrow was flushed from femora and tibia of 8–12-week-old male donor mice. Bone marrow cells were enumerated by hemocytometer, and 2 × 106 cells were injected via the tail vein into female recipient mice that had been lethally irradiated (1100 rads in two split doses). Recipient mice were analyzed at time points beginning 4 weeks and up to 12 months after transplantation. The success of transplantation was confirmed by PCR analysis for the presence of a Y chromosome-specific gene, Smcy, using primers SMC4-1 (5′-CTGAAGCCTTTGGCTTTGAGCAAGCTAC-3′) and SMCX-1 (5′-CAAAGAATTTGGCAGCGGTTTCCCT-3′) (8Agulnik A.I. Longepied G. Ty M.T. Bishop C.E. Mitchell M. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For competitive repopulation studies, donor engraftment was measured using the CD4.1/CD45.2 ratio as described (9Bunting K.D. Bradley H.L. Hawley T.S. Moriggl R. Sorrentino B.P. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2002; 99: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Differential leukocyte and red blood cell counts were determined using a Hemavet 950FS counter (Drew Scientific). A rabbit polyclonal anti-Bim antibody that recognizes all splice variants was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-tubulin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Bim analysis in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and thymocytes was performed as described (3Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). To assess the proapoptotic role of 24p3 in vivo, we derived homozygous mice bearing a deletion in the 24p3 gene. The targeting vector was designed to replace exons 1–5 of the 24p3 coding sequences with a phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin cassette (Fig. 1A). The targeting construct was transfected into murine embryonic stem cells, and neomycin-resistant colonies were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and PCR to identify those that harbored the homologously targeted integrand. Three positive embryonic stem cell clones carrying the mutant 24p3 allele were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Heterozygous 24p3+/− mice originating from one of the clones were intercrossed to produce F2 progeny. Routine genotyping of the mice was carried out by PCR amplification of genomic tail DNA (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the targeted knock-out successfully abolished 24p3 expression, we performed immunoblot analysis on concentrated urine samples from wild type (24p3+/+), heterozygous (24p3+/−), and homozygous (24p3−/−) mice using an anti-24p3 antibody. As expected, 24p3 was present in the urine of 24p3+/+ mice, reduced in 24p3+/− mice, and absent in 24p3−/− mice (Fig. 1C). We derived congenic 24p3−/− mice on various genetic backgrounds by sequentially back-crossing F2 progeny to 129/SVE or C57BL/6 mice (see below). Mice deficient for 24p3 on 129/SVE, C57BL/6, or the mixed genetic background (129/SVE × C57BL/6) were analyzed in this report. In all three strains, 24p3−/− mice were normal in appearance and size, displayed no overt physical abnormalities, developed normally, exhibited normal growth, and were fertile. Based on the proapoptotic activity of 24p3 in a variety of hematopoietic cells (4Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that 24p3−/− mice would display an accumulation of bone marrow cells. To test this idea, we first determined the total cellularity of the bone marrow of 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice. The results, presented in Table 1, demonstrated that the total number of cells in the bone marrow of 24p3−/− mice was ∼1.6-fold higher than that of 24p3+/+ littermates.TABLE 1Hematological profile of bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen from 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice24p3+/+24p3−/−p valueBone marrowBone marrow (× 107)4.05 ± 0.706.36 ± 1.20<0.01Gr-1+/Mac-1+ cells (%)46.10 ± 1.1251.37 ± 1.230.0018B220+ cells (%)22.80 ± 2.0027.22 ± 1.100.028Ter-119+ cells (%)17 ± 1.0821 ± 2.480.017Peripheral bloodLeukocytesWhite blood cells (× 103)4.75 ± 0.929.32 ± 0.650.006Lymphocytes (× 103)3.23 ± 0.645.12 ± 0.940.05Neutrophils (× 103)1.19 ± 0.473.56 ± 0.340.002Eosinophils (× 103)0.03 ± 0.0250.19 ± 0.140.079Monocytes (× 103)0.28 ± 0.110.42 ± 0.10.176Basophils (× 103)0.007 ± 0.0090.005 ± 0.010.788ErythrocytesRed blood cells (106/μl)7.61 ± 2.648.94 ± 1.090.393Hematocrit (%)32.45 ± 1.7239.06 ± 4.660.343Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg)12.17 ± 1.3914.28 ± 0.280.073Platelets1733 ± 7501092 ± 63.690.102SpleenSplenocytes (× 107)12.00 ± 0.7013.50 ± 3.20<0.01B220+ cells (%)46.00 ± 1.0053.00 ± 2.00<0.05Ter-119+ cells (%)5.70 ± 1.8216.42 ± 2.323.26 × 10−5 Open table in a new tab To assess the cell composition of the bone marrow, we performed flow cytometry with various lineage-specific markers, including Gr-1/Mac-1 (a myeloid marker), B220 (a B cell marker), and Ter-119 (an erythroid marker). The results revealed that the increase in bone marrow cell number in 24p3−/− mice was due to an abnormal accumulation of Gr-1+/Mac-1+ myeloid cells, as well as Ter-119+ and B220+ cells (Table 1). Immature B cells that have passed checkpoints in the bone marrow emigrate to the spleen, where they undergo further transitional stages to become mature B cells. These transitional B cells express the surface marker B220 among others. Consistent with the findings of BM, the proportion of B220+ splenic cells in 24p3−/− mice was ∼1.5-fold higher when compared with control splenic samples (Table 1). The Ter119+ cells in the spleen of 24p3−/− mice was also higher (∼3-fold increase), and these results are consistent with the fact that 24p3 regulates mouse erythropoiesis (Table 1) (10Miharada K. Hiroyama T. Sudo K. Danjo I. Nagasawa T. Nakamura Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 215: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Next we compared the hematological profile of peripheral blood in 24p3−/− and 24p3+/+ mice (Table 1). Analysis of total leukocyte counts showed that the number of white blood cells was elevated ∼1.96-fold in 24p3−/− mice. Analysis of differential leukocyte counts revealed that, with the exception of basophils, all leukocyte cell types were increased in 24p3−/− mice. Furthermore, compared with 24p3+/+ mice, the peripheral blood of 24p3−/− mice contained an increased number of mature red blood cells, resulting in an elevated hematocrit. By contrast, the number of platelets in the peripheral blood of 24p3−/− and 24p3+/+ mice was similar. To determine whether the hematological abnormalities were cell-intrinsic, bone marrow from 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− male mice was transplanted into either 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− female mice (Fig. 2A), and the hematological profile of recipient mice was analyzed 12 months after transplantation. PCR analysis using a Y chromosome-specific marker confirmed the success of transplantation (Fig. 2B). We found that 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− mice transplanted with bone marrow from 24p3−/− mice developed severe leukocytosis with increased numbers of both neutrophils and lymphocytes, whereas mice transplanted with bone marrow from 24p3+/+ mice retained a relatively normal hematological profile (Table 2). Interestingly, we have also noticed a milder monocytosis in mice transplanted with bone marrow from 24p3−/− mice (∼2.5-fold increase in group 3 when compared with group 1). These results are consistent with the previous findings that 24p3 is a regulator of monocyte/macrophage growth (10Miharada K. Hiroyama T. Sudo K. Danjo I. Nagasawa T. Nakamura Y. J. Cell.

Thus, the hematological abnormalities of 24p3−/− mice are cell-intrinsic.TABLE 2Hematological profile of 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice following bone marrow transplantationDonor 24p3+/+Donor 24p3−/−p value (Group 1 versus Group 3)Recipient 24p3+/+ (Group 1) (n = 3)Recipient 24p3−/− (Group 2) (n = 6)Recipient 24p3+/+ (Group 3) (n = 6)Recipient 24p3−/− (Group 4) (n = 4)White blood cells (× 103)3.63 ± 0.353.70 ± 1.3110.64 ± 0.711.52 ± 0.670.05Lymphocytes (× 103)2.46 ± 0.352.60 ± 0.434.64 ± 0.265.45 ± 0.530.0126Neutrophils (× 103)1.52 ± 0.190.82 ± 0.654.94 ± 0.655.39 ± 0.350.05Monocytes (× 103)0.29 ± 0.070.28 ± 0.020.73 ± 0.070.83 ± 0.170.04Red blood cells (× 106)7.78 ± 0.85.60 ± 0.507.92 ± 0.168.75 ± 0.700.807 Open table in a new tab Given the potential role of 24p3 in regulating hematopoietic system homeostasis, we aged 24p3−/− mice on the 129/SVE background up to 18 months and compared their hematological profiles with age-matched control 24p3+/+ mice. We did not observe any differences in the mortality rates of 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice during this period (n = 30). After 18 months, there was pronounced leukocytosis in 24p3−/− mice (Table 3). In particular, the number of circulating neutrophils was ∼4.3-fold higher in 24p3−/− mice compared with 24p3+/+ mice. In addition, these mice also displayed a moderate increase in the number of circulating monocytes (∼1.75-fold increase in 24p3−/− mice), thus further confirming the two previous reports that 24p3 suppresses the growth of monocytes/macrophages (10Miharada K.

Kim I.K. Suk K. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3231-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These results further demonstrate that 24p3 regulates homeostasis of the myeloid compartment.TABLE 3Hematological profile of aged 24p3+/+ and 24p3−/− mice24p3+/+24p3−/−p valueWhite blood cells (× 103)9.18 ± 1.0123.6 ± 0.250.039Lymphocytes (× 103)5.32 ± 0.516.15 ± 0.510.45Neutrophils (× 103)3.8 ± 0.1916.28 ± 1.130.04Monocytes (× 103)0.42 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.010.01Red blood cells (× 106)8.41 ± 0.075.93 ± 0.580.09Hematocrit (%)50.75 ± 4.3145.5 ± 4.380.55Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg)16.35 ± 1.0018.8 ± 4.10.58 Open table in a new tab Because defects were observed in the myeloid compartment, we next examined whether the increase in neutrophils was due to increased hematopoiesis along the myeloid lineage. This was measured in two ways. First, bone marrow cells were isolated from 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− mice (CD45.2) and were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with BoyJ competitor cells (CD45.1), followed by competitive repopulation in lethally irradiated recipient mice. Analysis of the transplanted mice 9 weeks later showed normal reconstitution of the total white blood cells, and multilineage analysis (performed 6 months post-transplantation) did not show any bias toward the myeloid lineage when comparing 24p3−/− with 24p3+/+ groups (Figs. 3, A and B). Similarly, 5-FU treatment of 24p3+/+ or 24p3−/− mice resulted in comparable declines in bone marrow cells (Fig. 3C). Although the impact of 5-FU was mild on the Sca-1+Lin− fraction (Fig. 3D), there was clearly no increased recovery in the 24p3−/− group; rather, these cells were modestly lower (p = 0.033). Therefore, 24p3 does not promote myelopoiesis through an affect on early hematopoietic progenitor cells. To determine whether the abnormal hematological profiles observed in 24p3−/− mice resulted from an apoptotic defect, we performed a series of in vitro experiments. Bone marrow cells from 24p3−/− and 24p3+/+ mice were cultured in the presence of a cytokine mixture comprising IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, and stem cell factor, and at various time points, the total cell counts and cell subset composition were analyzed by flow cytometry. Consistent with the in vivo results (Table 1), we observed an increase in the total number of cells (Fig. 4A) and the percentage of Gr-1+/Mac-1+ cells (Fig. 4B) in bone marrow cultures derived from 24p3−/− mice. To determine whether the increased number of Gr-1+ cells was due to resistance of 24p3−/− cells to apoptosis, we first analyzed spontaneous apoptosis of cultured Gr-1+ bone marrow cells by annexin V-FITC staining. The results of Fig. 4C show that Gr-1+ 24p3−/− cells had a reduced rate of spontaneous apoptosis compared with Gr-1+ 24p3+/+ cells. We also analyzed apoptosis induction following cytokine deprivation in peritoneal neutrophils. Fig. 4D shows, as expected, that removal of G-CSF resulted in a substantial induction of apoptosis in 24p3+/+ Gr-1+ cells. By contrast, 24p3−/− Gr-1+ cells were largely resistant to apoptosis resulting from G-CSF deprivation. Finally, we measured granulocyte precursor frequencies by colony formation in bone marrow cell cultures supported by cytokines. The results of Fig. 4E indicate that the number of colony-forming units from bone marrow cells from 24p3−/− mice was substantially higher than that from 24p3+/+ mice. In addition, the size of the G-CSF-dependent colony was much larger in 24p3−/− mice than that from 24p3+/+ mice. Prolonged culture of bone marrow cells in IL-3-containing medium results in a uniform population of bone mucosal mast cells, which are commonly referred to as BMMCs (6Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. López-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Tsuji K. Zsebo K.M. Ogawa M. J. Cell.

When IL-3 is removed from the culture medium, BMMCs undergo apoptosis. Therefore, these cells serve as model to study IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis in primary cells (7Mekori Y.A. Oh C.K. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3775-3784PubMed Google Scholar, 14Metcalfe D.D. Mekori J.A. Rottem M. Exp. Dermatol. 1995; 4: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the 24p3/24p3R pathway has a role in inducing apoptosis in IL-3-dependent cell lines and primary cells following cytokine deprivation (4Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows that following cytokine deprivation, BMMCs from 24p3+/+ mice underwent efficient apoptosis, as expected. Significantly, in 24p3−/− BMMCs, apoptosis following cytokine deprivation was substantially reduced. We have previously shown that 24p3 induces apoptosis through a pathway culminating in decreased intracellular iron levels (3Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). If 24p3 is responsible for apoptosis induction in cytokine-deprived 24p3+/+ BMMCs, then supplementation with exogenous iron should prevent cell death. In support of this possibility, Fig. 5A shows that, following IL-3 deprivation, the addition of FeCl3 substantially reduced apoptosis in 24p3+/+ BMMCs. 24p3 is a secreted protein, and CM from cytokine-deprived IL-3-dependent cell lines, such as FL5.12 cells, induces apoptosis following the addition to naive cells (4Devireddy L.R.

https://openalex.org/W2002763682,"A novel double deletion in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) of two highly conserved amino acids (Asn-100 and Glu-101) was found in a restrictive cardiomyopathic (RCM) pediatric patient. Clinical evaluation revealed the presence of left atrial enlargement and marked left ventricle diastolic dysfunction. The explanted heart examined by electron microscopy revealed myofibrillar disarray and mild fibrosis. Pedigree analysis established that this mutation arose de novo. The patient tested negative for six other sarcomeric genes. The single and double recombinant cTnT mutants were generated, and their functional consequences were analyzed in porcine skinned cardiac muscle. In the adult Tn environment (cTnT3 + cardiac troponin I), the single cTnT3-ΔN100 and cTnT3-ΔE101 mutations had opposing effects on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development compared with WT, whereas the double deletion cTnT3-ΔN100/ΔE101 increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity + 0.19 pCa units. In addition, cTnT3-ΔN100/ΔE101 decreased the cooperativity of force development, suggesting alterations in intrafilament protein-protein interactions. In the fetal Tn environment, (cTnT1 + slow skeletal troponin I), the single (cTnT1-ΔN110) and double (cTnT1-ΔN110/ΔE111) deletions did not change the Ca(2+) sensitivity compared with control. To recreate the patient's heterozygous genotype, we performed a reconstituted ATPase activity assay. Thin filaments containing 50:50 cTnT3-ΔN100/ΔE101:cTnT3-WT also increased the myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity compared with WT. Co-sedimentation of thin filament proteins indicated that no significant changes occurred in the binding of Tn containing the RCM cTnT mutation to actin-Tm. This report reveals the protective role of Tn fetal isoforms as they rescue the increased Ca(2+) sensitivity produced by a cTnT-RCM mutation and may account for the lack of lethality during gestation."
https://openalex.org/W1998029371,"An elevated level of homocysteine, a thiol amino acid, is associated with various complex disorders. The cellular effects of homocysteine and its precursors S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) are, however, poorly understood. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to understand the basis of pathogenicity induced by homocysteine and its precursors. Both homocysteine and AdoHcy but not AdoMet inhibited the growth of the str4Δ strain (which lacks the enzyme that converts homocysteine to cystathionine-mimicking vascular cells). Addition of AdoMet abrogated the inhibitory effect of AdoHcy but not that of homocysteine indicating that an increase in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio is sufficient to overcome the AdoHcy-mediated growth defect but not that of homocysteine. Also, the transcriptomic profile of AdoHcy and homocysteine showed gross dissimilarity based on gene enrichment analysis. Furthermore, compared with homocysteine, AdoHcy treatment caused a higher level of oxidative stress in the cells. However, unlike a previously reported response in wild type (Kumar, A., John, L., Alam, M. M., Gupta, A., Sharma, G., Pillai, B., and Sengupta, S. (2006) Biochem. J. 396, 61-69), the str4Δ strain did not exhibit an endoplasmic reticulum stress response. This suggests that homocysteine induces varied response depending on the flux of homocysteine metabolism. We also observed altered expression of mitochondrial genes, defective membrane potential, and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network together with the increased expression of fission genes indicating that the imbalance in homocysteine metabolism has a major effect on mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, treatment of cells with homocysteine or AdoHcy resulted in apoptosis as revealed by annexin V staining and TUNEL assay. Cumulatively, our results suggest that elevated levels of homocysteine lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which could potentially initiate pro-apoptotic pathways, and this could be one of the mechanisms underlying homocysteine-induced pathogenicity."

https://openalex.org/W2074137152,"Phosphorylation of rhodopsin by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1, or rhodopsin kinase) is critical for the deactivation of the phototransduction cascade in vertebrate photoreceptors. Based on our previous studies in vitro, we predicted that Ser21 in GRK1 would be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in vivo. Here, we report that dark-adapted, wild-type mice demonstrate significantly elevated levels of phosphorylated GRK1 compared with light-adapted animals. Based on comparatively slow half-times for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, phosphorylation of GRK1 by PKA is likely to be involved in light and dark adaptation. In mice missing the gene for adenylyl cyclase type 1, levels of phosphorylated GRK1 were low in retinas from both dark- and light-adapted animals. These data are consistent with reports that cAMP levels are high in the dark and low in the light and also indicate that cAMP generated by adenylyl cyclase type 1 is required for phosphorylation of GRK1 on Ser21. Surprisingly, dephosphorylation was induced by light in mice missing the rod transducin α-subunit. This result indicates that phototransduction does not play a direct role in the light-dependent dephosphorylation of GRK1. Phosphorylation of rhodopsin by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1, or rhodopsin kinase) is critical for the deactivation of the phototransduction cascade in vertebrate photoreceptors. Based on our previous studies in vitro, we predicted that Ser21 in GRK1 would be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in vivo. Here, we report that dark-adapted, wild-type mice demonstrate significantly elevated levels of phosphorylated GRK1 compared with light-adapted animals. Based on comparatively slow half-times for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, phosphorylation of GRK1 by PKA is likely to be involved in light and dark adaptation. In mice missing the gene for adenylyl cyclase type 1, levels of phosphorylated GRK1 were low in retinas from both dark- and light-adapted animals. These data are consistent with reports that cAMP levels are high in the dark and low in the light and also indicate that cAMP generated by adenylyl cyclase type 1 is required for phosphorylation of GRK1 on Ser21. Surprisingly, dephosphorylation was induced by light in mice missing the rod transducin α-subunit. This result indicates that phototransduction does not play a direct role in the light-dependent dephosphorylation of GRK1. The ability of rod and cone photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina to adjust the speed and sensitivity of their responses to changing intensities of light is essential for normal visual function. Photoreceptors respond to light stimuli within milliseconds and rapidly terminate signaling to recover and maintain their sensitivity under constantly changing ambient light. In rods, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) 3The abbreviations used are: GRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseAC1adenylyl cyclase type 1. contributes to signal turnoff via phosphorylation of rhodopsin, the G protein-coupled receptor that initiates the phototransduction cascade. Phosphorylation is followed by the binding of arrestin to rhodopsin, which sterically blocks the interaction of rhodopsin with its G protein, transducin (1Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2Wilden U. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). GRK1 is expressed in rods of all vertebrates and in cones in several vertebrates (3Weiss E.R. Ducceschi M.H. Horner T.J. Li A. Craft C.M. Osawa S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9175-9184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, GRK1 is expressed in both rods and cones in mice, where it phosphorylates rhodopsin and the cone opsins, respectively (4Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B.

In humans, inactivating mutations in GRK1 result in severe defects in rod phototransduction, causing stationary night blindness as well as mild defects in cone phototransduction (7Cideciyan A.V.

GRK1 is regulated allosterically by its substrate so that it only phosphorylates light-activated rhodopsin as part of a precisely timed mechanism of deactivation in response to light (10Fowles C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have proposed a novel mechanism for regulating GRK1 activity via phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), based on the reduced ability of phosphorylated GRK1 to phosphorylate rhodopsin in vitro (12Horner T.J. Osawa S. Schaller M.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28241-28250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate that GRK1 is a substrate for PKA in vivo. We show that phosphorylation of GRK1 is high in the dark and low in the light. The rate of change in the phosphorylation state of GRK1 is comparatively slow, possibly contributing to the ability of photoreceptors to adapt to continuously changing levels of light. Our findings introduce the exciting possibility that cAMP plays a role in regulating the lifetime of rhodopsin by altering the activity of GRK1 during dark and light adaptation. Unexpectedly, light-dependent dephosphorylation of GRK1 in mice missing the transducin α subunit was normal, indicating that a pathway other than phototransduction may be involved in the regulation of GRK1 dephosphorylation. A monoclonal antibody directed against GRK1 (D11) was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Rockford, IL). An antibody directed against GRK1 phosphorylated at Ser21 (anti-pGRK1) was generated against a phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acids 16–28 of mouse GRK1 (IAARG[pS]FDGSSTP) by 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). Secondary antibodies for immunoblot analysis (Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG and IRDye800 goat anti-mouse IgG) and immunocytochemistry (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG) were purchased from Invitrogen or Fisher Scientific. All mice were in a C57BL/6 background, except for the Trα−/− mice, which were in a 129SV background. Therefore, in experiments using the Trα−/− mice, wild-type mice in the 129SV background were used as controls. Mice were raised under a normal 12-h light/12-h dark cycle except for the Arr−/− mice, which were raised in the dark to prevent light-dependent retinal degeneration (13Chen J. Simon M.I. Matthes M.T. Yasumura D. LaVail M.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2978-2982PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were dark- or light-adapted for the indicated times, followed by euthanasia using procedures in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For immunoblot analysis, eyes were enucleated and the retinas removed under infrared light or under a light intensity of ∼1,500 lux in HEPES-Ringer buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm potassium chloride, 0.2 mm calcium chloride, 0.2 mm magnesium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm DTT (14Lee B.Y. Thulin C.D. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54008-54017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Each retina was placed in 100 μl of HEPES-Ringer buffer, followed by the addition of 150 μl of heated (95 °C) buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 100 mm NaF for homogenization using a motorized pestle. The homogenates were heated for 3 min at 95 °C and sheared with a 25-gauge needle. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C and the supernatant collected for protein determination. After adding bromphenol blue and β-mercaptoethanol, 25 μg of sample protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes were preincubated in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NB) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-pGRK1, 1:1,000; anti-GRK1, 1:10,000. After incubation with secondary antibodies at 1:10,000, the blots were analyzed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor Biosciences). For experiments in Fig. 6, retinas were removed as described above and incubated ex vivo in 100 μl of HEPES-Ringer solution containing the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, as described in the legend to Fig. 6. For immunocytochemistry, enucleation was followed by incubation overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C and washing three times in PBS. Eyes were cryoprotected and sectioned as described (15Osawa S. Jo R. Weiss E.R. J. Neurochem. 2008; 107: 1314-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Sections were rehydrated for 5 min in PBS, followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature in 1% SDS in PBS, washed three times for 5 min each in PBS, and incubated with antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-pGRK1, 1:100; anti-GRK1, 1:10,000. Additional washes and incubation with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG at 1;1,000) were performed as described (15Osawa S. Jo R. Weiss E.R. J. Neurochem. 2008; 107: 1314-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Images were collecting using a Nikon Eclipse 400 Epifluorescent microscope (see Fig. 3A) or a Nikon Eclipse 90i confocal microscope (see Fig. 3B). The photoreceptor layer from a flat-mounted frozen retina was isolated in a series of 10-mm tangential sections, and the peptide composition of each section was analyzed by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (16Reidel B.

Briefly, two 60-day-old pigmented Long-Evans rats (Rattus norwegicus) were dark-adapted for at least 12 h and sacrificed under dim red light either immediately or following a 1-h exposure to bright light producing 15,000 lux on the cornea surface as described (17Lobanova E.S.

Serial tangential sectioning was performed as described by Sokolov et al. (18Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) with modifications described by Strissel et al. (19Strissel K.J. Sokolov M. Trieu L.H. Arshavsky V.Y. J.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Each retina section was dissolved in 50 μl of 0.5% v/v AALS II (Anionic Acid-Liable Surfactant; Protea Biosciences, Morgantown, WV), followed by sonication and boiling for 5 min. Cysteine residues were reduced with 10 mm DTT and alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested with trypsin (15 ng/μl) overnight at 37 °C. Peptide digests obtained from each of the 24 sections (12 from each retina) were analyzed using a nanoAcquity UPLC system coupled to a Synapt HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Tandem MS data including phosphorylation as a variable modification were obtained in the data-dependent acquisition mode and searched against the NCBInr protein data base. These data are available online in the form of a Scaffold 3 file (.sf3, Proteome Software, Inc.). 4For access to the database, please send a message to V. Y. Arshavsky ([email protected]). The total intensities (calculated as a sum of ion chromatogram peak areas for a given peptide obtained by LC/MS analyses added across the first five sections, which represent outer segments, based on rhodopsin content) of the phosphorylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 20–31 of rat GRK1 (GS[p]FDGSSTPSSR, 1,263.499 Da) and the unphosphorylated peptide (GSFDGSSTPSSR, 1,183.499 Da) were measured in duplicate. The raw intensity data for each peptide can be found in lines 1464 and 1466 of supplemental Table 1 in Ref. 16. Statistical comparison of multiple groups was performed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test. Comparisons in Fig. 8B were performed using a Student's t test. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of GRK1 on Ser21 by PKA in vitro reduces its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin, suggesting a role for this posttranslational modification in phototransduction (12Horner T.J. Osawa S. Schaller M.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28241-28250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This potential phosphorylation site is conserved from fish to mammals (with the interesting exception of chicken GRK1) (Fig. 1), an evolutionary time scale of ∼400 million years (20Futuyama D.J. Evolutionary Biology. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1998: 130Google Scholar). Evolutionary conservation of PKA phosphorylation sites often predicts phosphorylation in vivo and strongly correlates with the physiological significance of phosphorylation (21Budovskaya Y.V. Stephan J.S. Deminoff S.J. Herman P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13933-13938Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Structural and mutagenesis studies also predict that the amino terminus of GRK1 is positioned to play a role in the interaction of the kinase with rhodopsin (22Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Singh P. Wang B. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14053-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Gan X.Q. Bao G.B. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) Thus, the fact that Ser21 is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and is highly conserved in vertebrate evolution suggests that it is phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation has an important physiological role in GRK function. To determine whether GRK1 is phosphorylated in vivo, wild-type mice were dark-adapted overnight, euthanized under infrared light, or exposed to bright light for 1 h prior to euthanasia. Using an antibody specific for mouse GRK1 phosphorylated on Ser21 (anti-pGRK1), immunoblot analysis of the retinas demonstrate that phosphorylation is high in dark-adapted mice and low in mice exposed to light (Fig. 2). In contrast, the levels of total GRK1 are unchanged. Immunocytochemical analysis shown in Fig. 3A reveal an elevated level of phosphorylated GRK1 in rod outer segments of dark-adapted mice compared with light-adapted animals. The merged images display colocalization of phosphorylated and total GRK1 in rod outer segments, consistent with previously published work indicating that GRK1 is primarily located in rod outer segments (25Strissel K.J. Lishko P.V. Trieu L.H. Kennedy M.J. Hurley J.B. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29250-29255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A comparison of retinas from light-adapted wild-type mice with those from light- and dark-adapted GRK1 knock-out (RK−/−) mice stained with anti-pGRK1 demonstrates that the weak staining observed in the inner segment is nonspecific (Fig. 3B). Using an entirely independent method to identify phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GRK1, we separated the outer segment layer from dark- and light-adapted rat retinas by freezing and tangential sectioning and identified the phosphorylation status of Ser21 by mass spectrometry as described previously (16Reidel B. Thompson J.W. Farsiu S. Moseley M.A. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.002469)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two peptides were identified by tandem MS analysis corresponding to amino acids 20–31 of rat GRK1: the unphosphorylated peptide (GSFDGSSTPSSR) and a peptide phosphorylated at a serine corresponding to Ser21 (GS[p]FDGSSTPSSR) (Fig. 4). The relative amount of phosphorylated peptide, determined from the peak areas of the corresponding ion chromatograms, was elevated in the dark-adapted rats. Conversely, the unphosphorylated peptide was present in greater quantities in light-adapted animals. Taken together, the immunoblot, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometry data indicate that Ser21 is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in vivo in a light-dependent manner, strengthening our hypothesis that this phosphorylation contributes to the function of GRK1. A time course analysis was performed to determine how rapidly light exposure results in the loss of phosphorylated GRK1. When dark-adapted mice were placed in the light, GRK1 was dephosphorylated in vivo with a half-time of ∼4 min (Fig. 5A). Similarly, mice that were light-adapted for 2 h then dark-adapted for various times, exhibited an increase in phosphorylated GRK1 with a half-time of ∼5 min (Fig. 5B). These relatively slow changes in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are consistent with an influence on dark and light adaptation. Although phototransduction has been studied extensively, there are still unknown factors that influence the timing and amplification of signaling under conditions of sustained illumination (26Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. Makino C.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that recombinant GRK1 can be phosphorylated in retina extracts by an endogenous kinase (12Horner T.J. Osawa S. Schaller M.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28241-28250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To establish the identity of this kinase, we incubated retinas removed from light-adapted mice with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, which raises cyclic nucleotide levels by inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity. The data in Fig. 6 indicate that stimulation of cAMP synthesis and/or inhibition of its breakdown indeed results in phosphorylation of GRK1. Adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive isoform of adenylyl cyclase that is selectively expressed in the brain and the neural retina (28Xia Z. Choi E.J. Wang F. Blazynski C. Storm D.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). AC1 was previously identified as the primary enzyme for synthesis of cAMP in photoreceptor cells (29Jackson C.R. Chaurasia S.S. Zhou H. Haque R. Storm D.R. Iuvone P.M. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine whether AC1 contributes to the phosphorylation of GRK1, AC1 knock-out (Adcy1−/−) mice (30Wu Z.L. Thomas S.A. Villacres E.C. Xia Z. Simmons M.L. Chavkin C. Palmiter R.D. Storm D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) were evaluated. Compared with wild-type mice, retinas from Adcyl−/− mice displayed very little phosphorylation of GRK1 under either light- or dark-adapted conditions (Fig. 7). These data indicate that phosphorylation of GRK1 by PKA requires AC1. Because AC1 is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin, we speculated that its activity is influenced by the reduction in intracellular Ca2+ that occurs during the photoresponse (31Burns M.E. Pugh Jr., E.N. Physiology. 2010; 25: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that mice null for Gαt (Trα−/− mice) would not exhibit light-dependent dephosphorylation of PKA-phosphorylated substrates because Ca2+ levels in these mice do not change in the absence of phototransduction (32Woodruff M.L. Sampath A.P. Matthews H.R. Krasnoperova N.V. Lem J. Fain G.L. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, phosphorylation of GRK1 on Ser21 was high in the dark and low in the light in Trα−/− mice (Fig. 8A), indicating that GRK1 dephosphorylation is independent of phototransduction. Because the binding of visual arrestin to light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin is independent of Gtα1, it is possible that arrestin could signal via an unknown pathway to mediate dephosphorylation of GRK1 in rods, as observed for arrestin2 and arrestin3 in different cell types (e.g. 33Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the phosphorylation of GRK1 in arrestin knock-out (Arr−/−) mice. The results show that dephosphorylation of GRK1 occurs in the absence of arrestin (Fig. 8B). Therefore, neither transducin nor arrestin is necessary for the light-dependent dephosphorylation of GRK1. The present report describes the phosphorylation of GRK1 on Ser21 by PKA in mouse photoreceptor cells. The level of phosphorylation is high in the dark and low in the light. Ser21 is part of an α-helical domain in the amino terminus that is structurally conserved across the GRK family of proteins. Biochemical and structural studies indicate that this region generally plays a role in receptor interaction, leading to allosteric activation of the kinase (22Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Gan X.Q. Bao G.B. Li L. Pei G. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47466-47476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), possibly through interaction with the hinge region of the RGS homology domain and a region of the kinase domain of the carboxyl terminus (23Singh P. Wang B. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14053-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Huang C.C. Orban T. Jastrzebska B. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although Ser21 is visualized in the crystal structure of GRK1, its potential interactions with rhodopsin or regions of the kinase have not been defined. Previously, we reported that the cone-specific GRK, GRK7, is similarly phosphorylated on Ser36 in cones of dark-adapted animals (15Osawa S. Jo R. Weiss E.R. J. Neurochem. 2008; 107: 1314-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mice do not have the gene for GRK7 and, instead, express only GRK1 in both rods and cones (3Weiss E.R. Ducceschi M.H. Horner T.J. Li A. Craft C.M. Osawa S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9175-9184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our prior studies in vitro indicate that phosphorylation of rhodopsin is reduced when GRK1 is phosphorylated by PKA (12Horner T.J. Osawa S. Schaller M.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28241-28250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because cAMP levels in photoreceptor cells are elevated in the dark and decline upon light exposure (36Cohen A.I. Blazynski C. Vis. Neurosci. 1990; 4: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37Farber D.B. Souza D.W. Chase D.G. Lolley R.N. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1981; 20: 24-31PubMed Google Scholar), our data suggest a novel mechanism whereby the lifetime of rod and cone opsins may be influenced by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the GRKs. There are a number of potential mechanisms that may contribute to light adaptation in rods, including changes in the catalytic gain and lifetime of rhodopsin (38Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The lifetime of rhodopsin is limited by the rate of its phosphorylation by GRK1 followed by arrestin binding, which both take place within 40–54 ms from onset of the light response (39Chen C.K. Woodruff M.L. Chen F.S. Chen D. Fain G.L. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Gross O.P. Burns M.E. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3450-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of GRK1 by PKA in the dark and dephosphorylation in the light are much slower processes, with t½ values of ∼5 and 4 min, respectively. Therefore, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GRK1 may serve as a novel mechanism that contributes to long term adaptation of rod photoreceptors to the continually changing light environment by modifying the activity of GRK1 toward its substrate, rhodopsin; that is, rhodopsin phosphorylation may be slower in dark-adapted rods characterized by larger and longer electrical responses and faster in light-adapted rods, where photoresponses are smaller and shorter. Several groups have attempted to characterize the various factors responsible for light adaptation and determined that different mechanisms might be functioning during distinct phases of adaptation. For example, Calvert et al. (26Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. Makino C.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) noted two phases of adaptation: the better characterized fast phase with a time constant of 1–2 s, and a slower phase observed only at high light intensities. Burns and co-workers also identified a novel mechanism of adaptation, known as adaptive acceleration, which accelerates recovery and persists for many seconds (27Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other contributions to long term adaptation include translocation of transducin, arrestin, and recoverin (but not GRK1) (25Strissel K.J. Lishko P.V. Trieu L.H. Kennedy M.J. Hurley J.B. Arshavsky V.Y.

Future studies using transgenic mice with mutations at Ser21 are aimed at addressing the role of phosphorylation by PKA. Our studies also raise questions regarding the signaling pathway whereby cAMP is generated and how that pathway is regulated by light. As described above, cAMP in mouse photoreceptor cells is synthesized by Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive AC1 (29Jackson C.R. Chaurasia S.S. Zhou H. Haque R. Storm D.R. Iuvone P.M. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The authors observed a dramatic reduction in cAMP levels and the loss of light-dependent regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in Adcy1−/− mice. Consistent with our hypothesis that PKA, activated by cAMP, phosphorylates GRK1 on Ser21, we also observed an absence of GRK1 phosphorylation in the dark in the Adcy1−/− mice. It is known that AC1 is synergistically activated by Gs and Ca2+/calmodulin (42Ferguson G.D. Storm D.R. Physiology. 2004; 19: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although it has not been proven that AC1 is controlled by Ca2+/calmodulin in photoreceptor cells, it seems reasonable that Ca2+ plays a prominent role, given that the EC50 for AC1 is ∼100–150 nm (30Wu Z.L. Thomas S.A. Villacres E.C. Xia Z. Simmons M.L. Chavkin C. Palmiter R.D. Storm D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and that Ca2+ concentrations vary from 250 nm to 23 nm in dark- and light-adapted rod outer segments, respectively (32Woodruff M.L. Sampath A.P. Matthews H.R. Krasnoperova N.V. Lem J. Fain G.L. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the Trα−/− mice displayed normal, light-dependent dephosphorylation of GRK1, despite maintaining elevated levels of Ca2+. Previously, Rajala et al. (43Rajala A. Anderson R.E. Ma J.X. Lem J. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Rajala R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9865-9873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of the insulin receptor on tyrosine is high in the light and low in the dark, even in Trα−/− mice and speculated that arrestin may activate a signaling pathway that is independent of transducin. However, we found that the light-dependence of GRK1 dephosphorylation in Arr1−/− mice was also normal. Although feedback from cones or other cells in the retina could explain our results, it is also possible that there are unknown binding partners for rhodopsin. For example, rhodopsin may couple to other members of the Gi/Go family, as has been shown by us and others in cultured cells (44Weiss E.R. Heller-Harrison R.A. Diez E. Crasnier M. Malbon C.C. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 45Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. Exp.

It is also not clear whether the light-dependent decline in phosphorylation is mediated entirely by changes in adenylyl cyclase and kinase activity or whether changes in phosphodiesterase and phosphatase activities may be more important in determining the dephosphorylated state of GRK1. Phosphorylation of GRK family members by a variety of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases has been shown to play a significant role in localization, stability, and (in the case of GRK2 and GRK3) interaction with βγ in cultured cells (47Penela P. Ribas C. Mayor Jr., F. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The present report is, to our knowledge, the first example of phosphorylation demonstrated in native tissue. Other substrates for PKA in dark-adapted photoreceptor cells include phosducin (48Bauer P.H. Müller S. Puzicha M. Pippig S. Obermaier B. Helmreich E.J. Lohse M.J.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 15178-15186Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These proteins are located in different compartments in photoreceptor cells, suggesting that cAMP has a broad influence on multiple aspects of photoreceptor cell function, ranging from circadian-induced shedding of photoreceptor outer segments to rod-cone coupling. Cyclic AMP has been localized primarily to the inner segment and outer nuclear layer in dark-adapted rats (52Traverso V. Bush R.A. Sieving P.A. Deretic D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1655-1661PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ability of cAMP to diffuse rapidly throughout the cell suggests that it could be active in numerous compartments. Analysis of the major components of the cAMP signaling pathway, including the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA, will lead to a better understanding of its contribution to the function of GRK1 and its role in the response of photoreceptor cells to light.

The heterotrimeric G protein Gα13 stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of RH-RhoGEFs, leading to activation of RhoA. The mechanism by which Gα13 stimulates the GEF activity of RH-RhoGEFs, such as p115RhoGEF, has not yet been fully elucidated.

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins), composed of α, β, and γ subunits, act as molecular switches that cycle between an inactive, GDP-bound state and an active, GTP-bound state upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (1Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 117-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Once activated, the GTP-bound Gα subunit dissociates from the Gβγ dimer, both of which regulate the activity of multiple intracellular effectors to elicit cellular responses. The duration of signaling mediated by Gα is dictated by the lifetime of bound GTP. All Gα subunits have intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, and this rate of hydrolysis is enhanced by GAPs, 2The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinDHDbl homologyGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateLARGleukemia-associated RhoGEFPDZpost-synaptic density protein 95, discs large, zonula occludensPHpleckstrin homologyRGSregulator of G protein signalingRHRGS homologySf9Spodoptera frugiperdaSREserum response elementTEVtobacco etch virusTLCKNα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketoneTPCKN-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. such as RGS proteins (2Hollinger S.

U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in regulating multiple cellular processes that depend on activation of the monomeric GTPase RhoA, including gene transcription, embryogenesis, and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (6Mao J.

A direct link between Gα13 and RhoA was established with the discovery of p115RhoGEF, the founding member of a family of RhoA-specific GEFs containing an RH domain in their N termini (RH-RhoGEFs) (9Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Together with p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG constitute the RH-RhoGEF family in mammals (10Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Bloomfield C.D. Caligiuri M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2145-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The RH domain of p115RhoGEF has low sequence similarity to canonical RGS proteins but nevertheless functions as a GAP for Gα13 (12Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the RH domain of p115RhoGEF is similar to that of other RGS proteins (13Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), additional elements flanking the RGS box are required for GAP activity (14Chen Z. Singer W.D. Wells C.D. Sprang S.R. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9912-9919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and stability of the isolated domain (15Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition to its RH domain, p115RhoGEF also contains the tandem DH/PH domains characteristic of Dbl family RhoGEFs. The nucleotide exchange activity of p115RhoGEF can be directly stimulated by Gα13 in vitro (9Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and Gα13 acts synergistically with p115RhoGEF to activate Rho-dependent signaling in cells (16Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, p115RhoGEF functions as both an effector and a GAP for Gα13. Although the relationship between p115RhoGEF and Gα13 has been well established, the precise mechanism by which Gα13 regulates the activity of p115RhoGEF remains to be fully elucidated. The molecular mechanisms regulating p115RhoGEF activity are likely to be complex and may involve multiple intermolecular interfaces with Gα13. It has been clearly demonstrated that Gα13 binds directly to the RH domain of p115RhoGEF (12Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C.

Furthermore, this domain is required for both basal and Gα13-stimulated nucleotide exchange activity, suggesting that it plays a critical role in the activation mechanism (15Wells C.D. Liu M.Y.

A structure of the RH domain of p115RhoGEF bound to an AlF4−-activated Gα13-Gαi1 chimera has been solved by x-ray crystallography and revealed that the α subunit engages this domain through two distinct interfaces (17Chen Z. Singer W.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with switch regions I and II of Gα13/i1 through an N-terminal extension of the RGS box, the RH domain also docks into the hydrophobic groove between the α2 and α3 helices of Gα13/i1, a highly conserved effector interface among other Gα-effector pairs (18Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 19Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B.

However, many of the residues in the α3 helix of this chimera are derived from Gαi1, and its ability to activate p115RhoGEF has not been clearly demonstrated. Thus, the role of residues in the α3 helix in regulating p115RhoGEF activity is unknown. Gα13 has also been reported to bind to the isolated DH/PH domains of p115RhoGEF in vitro (15Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); however, it has no capacity to directly stimulate the GEF activity of this fragment. Therefore, the role of additional binding sites outside of the RH domain is also unclear. Here, specific residues in Gα13 that mediate activation of p115RhoGEF are identified. We demonstrate that mutation of these residues, which bind to the RH domain of p115RhoGEF, significantly impairs binding of Gα13 to p115RhoGEF as well as stimulation of GEF activity in cells and in vitro. Our results suggest that the initial step in stimulation of exchange activity by Gα13 involves allosteric regulation through interaction with the RH domain of p115RhoGEF. We also present a crystal structure of Gα13 bound to the RH domain of p115RhoGEF, which differs in several respects from the previously crystallized complex using the Gα13/i1 chimera (17Chen Z. Singer W.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and reinforces the results of our biochemical analysis. This structure provides a more accurate picture of the Gα13-p115RhoGEF RH interface, whereas the biochemical data provide new insight into the mechanism by which p115RhoGEF is activated by Gα13. Single point mutations were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 harboring murine Gα13 Q226L for use in SRE-luciferase assays or the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac HTa (Invitrogen) encoding Gαi/13 for protein expression using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The T274E/N278A double mutant was generated using either pCMV5-Gα13 Q226L T274E or pFastBac HTa-Gαi/13 T274E as the template. Sense and antisense primer pairs used to introduce each mutation were as follows: N270A, 5′-CGCCTTACAGAATCTCTGGCCATTTTTGAAACAATTG and 5′-CAATTGTTTCAAAAATGGCCAGAGATTCTGTAAGGCG; T274E, 5′-CTGAACATTTTTGAAGAGATTGTCAACAATCGGGTTTTCAGC and 5′-GCTGAAAACCCGATTGTTGACAATCTCTTCAAAAATGTTCAG; N278A, 5′-GAAACAATTGTCAACGCTCGGGTTTTCAGCAACG and 5′-CGTTGCTGAAAACCCGAGCGTTGACAATTGTTTC; T274E/N278A, 5′-GAAGAGATTGTCAACGCTCGGGTTTTCAGCAACG and 5′-CGTTGCTGAAAACCCGAGCGTTGACAATCTCTTC. Mutated bases are underlined. Introduction of the desired mutation was verified by automated dideoxy sequencing of each construct. Full-length Gα13 (Gα13 FL) was generated by first introducing a silent mutation into pCMV5-Gα13 by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis that eliminates an internal HindIII site using the primers 5′-GCCCGAGAGAAGCTCCATATTCCCTGGGG and 5′-CCCCAGGGAATATGGAGCTTCTCTCGGGC. Mutated bases are underlined. KpnI and HindIII sites were then introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of Gα13 by PCR using pCMV5-Gα13 lacking the internal HindIII site as the template and the primers 5′-GGTACCGCGGACTTCCTGCCGTC and 5′-GACCAAGCTTTCACTGCAGCATGAGCTG. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and HindIII and ligated into the pFastBac HT(−) vector containing the N-terminal α1 helix of Gαi1 such that the construct contains, from the N terminus, a His6 tag, residues 1–28 of Gαi1, a TEV protease site, and residues 2–377 of Gα13. Tyr763 of p115RhoGEF was mutated to a stop codon using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis using pFastBac HTc-p115RhoGEF as the template and the primers 5′-CACTGAGACTGCCGGATAACTGAAAGTCCCTGCCC and 5′-GGGCAGGGACTTTCAGTTATCCGGCAGTCTCAGTG. Mutated bases are underlined. His6-Gαi/13 and His6-Gαi/13 harboring the N270A, T274E, N278A, or T274E/N278A mutation(s) were purified from the soluble fraction of Sf9 cells as described previously (22Kreutz B. Yau D.M. Nance M.R. Tanabe S. Tesmer J.J. Kozasa T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The His6 tag was removed for crystallography by incubating His6-Gαi/13 with 2% (w/w) His6-TEV protease overnight at 4 °C. Uncut His6-Gαi/13 and His6-TEV protease were removed using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Gαi/13 was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, and 10% glycerol. The protein was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. His6-Gαi/13 FL was purified from Sf9 cells in the same fashion as His6-Gαi/13. After elution from nickel-NTA resin (Qiagen), fractions containing His6-Gαi/13 FL were pooled and incubated with 2% (w/w) His6-TEV protease overnight at 4 °C to remove the His6 tag and α1 helix of Gαi1. The protein was concentrated and buffer-exchanged to imidazole-free buffer using an Amicon Ultra 30k centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.). The protein was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Sf9 cells expressing His6-p115RhoGEF were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 16 μg/ml TPCK, TLCK, and PMSF, and 3.2 μg/ml leupeptin and lima bean trypsin inhibitor) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble portion of the lysate was diluted 2-fold with lysis buffer and applied to a nickel-NTA column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 20 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 16 μg/ml TPCK, TLCK, and PMSF, and 3.2 μg/ml leupeptin and lima bean trypsin inhibitor), and bound protein was eluted from the column using elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 16 μg/ml TPCK, TLCK, and PMSF, and 3.2 μg/ml leupeptin and lima bean trypsin inhibitor). Peak fractions containing His6-p115RhoGEF were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) in the presence of 2% (w/w) His6-TEV protease. The solution was supplemented with 10% glycerol and applied to a HisTrap HP column to remove remaining His6-p115RhoGEF and His6-TEV protease. Flow-through fractions were collected and applied to a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). Fractions containing p115RhoGEF were pooled and subjected to further purification on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer. Fractions containing p115RhoGEF were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 30k centrifugal filter device. The protein was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. His6-p115RhoGEFΔC(1–762) was purified from Sf9 cells in the same fashion as full-length p115RhoGEF except that the final round of size exclusion chromatography utilized a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/60 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT. The protein was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. The GST-tagged RH domain of p115RhoGEF was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (22Kreutz B. Yau D.M. Nance M.R. Tanabe S. Tesmer J.J. Kozasa T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GST-RhoA lacking the C-terminal CAAX motif (RhoA(1–181)) was expressed from the plasmid pGEX-6P (GE Healthcare) in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8, and protein expression was induced with 200 μm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 10% glycerol) and lysed with lysozyme and sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble portion of the lysate was applied to a column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer, followed by 20 bed volumes of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP). On-column cleavage of the GST tag was achieved using PreScission protease according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). Cleaved RhoA was eluted from the column using lysis buffer. Fractions containing RhoA were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 15k centrifugal filter device. The protein was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. To form nucleotide-free RhoA for crystallography, the protein was incubated with an excess of EDTA on ice. Assays were performed as described (23Kreutz B. Hajicek N. Yau D.M. Nakamura S. Kozasa T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with the following modification. Each well was co-transfected with 200 ng of pGL3-SRE.L, 100 ng of pCMV5-LacZ, and 10 ng of empty pCMV5 vector or the indicated Gα13 construct using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). For immunoblotting of cell lysates, samples were harvested directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled. Cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE, and Gα13 was detected by Western blotting with the B860 antibody (24Singer W.D. Miller R.T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAPDH was detected using a monoclonal antibody (clone 6C5, Ambion). 3 μg of Gαi/13 protein (wild type or mutant) was diluted into reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GDP) and incubated on ice for 45 min in the presence or absence of AlF4− (10 mm NaF, 30 μm AlCl3). Trypsin was added to a final concentration of 13.3% (w/w), and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Assays were preformed as described previously (22Kreutz B. Yau D.M. Nance M.R. Tanabe S. Tesmer J.J. Kozasa T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with the exception that bound proteins were released from the beads by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. GTPase assays were performed as described previously (12Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), except that reactions were incubated on ice. [γ-32P]GTP (specific activity = 6,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 2.8 nmol of full-length p115RhoGEF were incubated with 5.6 nmol of His6-Gαi/13 (wild type or mutant) for 30 min on ice in gel filtration buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP) in the presence or absence of AlF4− (10 mm NaF, 20 μm AlCl3). The total volume of each sample was 200 μl. The proteins were fractionated at 4 °C on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column equilibrated in the same buffer as the sample. Assays were performed as described previously (25Tanabe S. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS (specific activity = 1,250 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. To form the Gαi/13-p115ΔC-RhoA complex, Gαi/13 was activated with 8× AlF4− (80 mm NaF, 160 μm AlCl3) on ice for 15 min and mixed with an equimolar amount of p115RhoGEFΔC and nucleotide-free RhoA. The complex was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 10/16 gel filtration column, and fractions containing the stoichiometric complex were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon4 10k centrifugal filter device. Screening of the Gαi/13-p115RhoGEFΔC-RhoA complex was carried out using vapor diffusion at 20 °C. Diffraction quality crystals of the Gαi/13-p115RhoGEF RH domain complex were grown against a reservoir solution containing 15% PEG 4000 and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0). Single crystals were coated with the reservoir solution containing 20% PEG 400 as a cryoprotectant, mounted using a nylon loop, and flash-cooled in the cold stream of the goniometer. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K with a wavelength of 1.0 Å at SPring-8 beam line BL41XU (Harima, Japan). Data were processed with the HKL2000 program (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The structure of the Gαi/13-p115RhoGEF RH domain complex was determined by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (CCP4), using the RH domain of p115RhoGEF (Protein Data Bank entry 1IAP, chain A) and Gαi/13 (Protein Data Bank entry 1ZCB) as search models. The model was corrected iteratively using O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), and structure refinement was carried out using CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Open table in a new tab Previous studies have suggested that the region of Gα13 responsible for stimulating the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of p115RhoGEF is located C-terminal to the three switch regions (23Kreutz B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54283-54290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results are supported by crystallographic data, which demonstrate that the α3 helix and α3-β5 loop in Gα13 form a putative effector binding site with the RH domain of p115RhoGEF (17Chen Z. Singer W.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the capacity of residues in this region to stimulate GEF activity has not been directly demonstrated. We utilized these data along with the interaction between Gαq and its effectors PLC-β and GRK2 as models in order to identify specific amino acid residues responsible for activating p115RhoGEF. Recent work has identified several residues that are critical for the interaction between Gαq and these effectors, namely Ala253, Thr257, and Tyr261 (20Tesmer V.M. Kawano T. Shankaranarayanan A. Kozasa T. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2005; 310: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Waldo G.L. Ricks T.K. Hicks S.N. Cheever M.L. Kawano T. Tsuboi K. Wang X. Montell C. Kozasa T.

The Gαq-PLC-β interaction was selected as a model because, like RH-RhoGEFs, PLC-β functions both as a GAP (34Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and effector (35Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) for Gαq. Based on these data, Asn270, Thr274, and Asn278 in Gα13, which correspond to Ala253, Thr257, and Tyr261 in Gαq (Fig. 1A), were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis, and the effects of these mutations on the ability of Gα13 to regulate p115RhoGEF activity were examined. A constitutively active mutant of Gα13, Gα13 Q226L (hereafter referred to as Gα13 QL), has been shown to stimulate transcription from the SRE in a Rho-dependent manner when overexpressed in cells (6Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the ability of the N270A, T274E, N278A, and T274E/N278A mutants to stimulate Rho activation, HeLa cells, which endogenously express RH-RhoGEFs and RhoA, were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding each mutant in the background of Gα13 QL and a construct encoding the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the SRE. The activation status of Rho in cells was indirectly measured as luciferase activity of cell lysates. In this system, the N270A mutation in Gα13 QL did not affect Rho activation compared with Gα13 QL (Fig. 1B). However, both the T274E and N278A mutations decreased Rho activation by ∼50%, and Rho activity could be reduced to nearly basal levels by the T274E/N278A double mutation. Immunoblotting of cell lysates demonstrated equal expression levels of the constructs. These data suggested that residues Thr274 and Asn278, but not Asn270, are important for the ability of Gα13 to stimulate Rho activation in cells. To analyze these mutants in more detail, each mutation was introduced into a construct harboring amino acid residues 1–28 of Gαi1 and 47–377 of Gα13 (hereafter referred to as Gαi/13). The resulting protein was expressed and purified from Sf9 cells for biochemical reconstitution assays. The use of this Gαi/13 chimera facilitates the production of recombinant protein by increasing the yield from Sf9 cells, and it retains all of the biochemical properties characteristic of na"
https://openalex.org/W2150796710,"Single amino acid deletions in the β3-β4 hairpin loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been identified in heavily treated patients. The deletion of Asp-67 together with mutations T69G and K70R (Δ67 complex) are usually associated with thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs) (e.g. M41L, T215Y, etc.) while the deletion of Thr-69 (Δ69) is rarely found in isolates containing TAMs. Here, we show that the complex Δ67/T69G/K70R enhances ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity on primers terminated with 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT) or 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T) both in the presence or absence of TAMs (i.e. M41L/T215Y), while Δ69 (or the complex S68G/Δ69/K70G) antagonize the effects of TAMs in ATP-mediated excision. These effects are consistent with AZT susceptibility data obtained with recombinant HIV-1 bearing the relevant RTs. Molecular dynamics studies based on models of wild-type HIV-1 RT and mutant Δ69, Δ67/T69G/K70R, and D67N/K70R RTs support a relevant role for Lys/Arg-70 in the excision reaction. In Δ69 RT, the side chain of Lys-70 locates away from the putative pyrophosphate binding site. Therefore, its participation in interactions required for the excision reaction is unlikely. Our theoretical studies also suggest a role for Lys-219 in thymidine analog excision/discrimination. However, pre-steady-state kinetics revealed only minor differences in selectivity of AZT-triphosphate versus dTTP between deletion-containing RTs and their homologous enzymes having the K219E mutation. K219E reduced both ATP- and pyrophosphate-mediated excision of primers terminated with thymidine analogues, only when introduced in RTs bearing Δ69 or S68G/Δ69/K70G, providing further biochemical evidence that explains the lack of association of Δ69 and TAMs in HIV-1 isolates.

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimeric enzyme that converts the single-stranded viral genomic RNA into double-stranded DNA, which is integrated into the host genome (1Sarafianos S.G. Marchand B. Das K. Himmel D.M. Parniak M.A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 693-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Herschhorn A. Hizi A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 2717-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is composed of subunits of 560 and 440 residues, designated as p66 and p51, respectively. Both subunits have identical amino acid sequence, but p51 lacks residues 441–560 of p66, because they are removed by the HIV-1 protease during virus maturation. The DNA polymerase active site resides within the palm subdomain of p66, which contains the essential catalytic aspartic acid residues 110, 185, and 186. HIV-1 RT is a major target for chemotherapeutic intervention in the control of AIDS. Drugs targeting this viral enzyme include nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitors (NRTIs) 3The abbreviations used are: NRTIsnucleoside RT inhibitorsPPipyrophosphateTAMthymidine analogue resistance mutationAZT3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidined4T2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine3TCβ-L-(−)-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidineTPtriphosphatedsDNAdouble-stranded DNAMPmonophosphate. and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) (3De Clercq E.

NRTIs (e.g. zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine, etc.) have to be converted to their triphosphate derivatives to be incorporated into the nascent DNA by the viral RT. Because NRTIs lack a 3′-OH group their incorporation results in chain termination. nucleoside RT inhibitors pyrophosphate thymidine analogue resistance mutation 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine β-L-(−)-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine triphosphate double-stranded DNA monophosphate. There are two major mechanisms of HIV resistance to NRTIs (reviewed in Refs. 1Sarafianos S.G. Marchand B. Das K. Himmel D.M. Parniak M.A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol.

One of them is based on nucleotide selectivity, and is exemplified by lamivudine-resistance mutations M184V and M184I, and by the Q151M complex (A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M) that confers resistance to multiple NRTIs (6Sarafianos S.G.

These amino acid substitutions affect residues of the dNTP binding site of the RT (8Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), while reducing the enzyme's ability to incorporate the triphosphorylated NRTIs. The second mechanism involves enhanced excision of the chain-terminating NRTI from the 3′-end of the blocked primer, using ATP as pyrophosphate (PPi) donor (9Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Unblocking the primer allows RT to continue DNA synthesis. Available data indicate that thymidine analogues (i.e. zidovudine or stavudine) and tenofovir are the best substrates of the reaction (9Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol.

These mutations are usually known as thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs) and emerge after long-term therapy with β-d-(+)-3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine) and/or β-d-(+)-2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T, stavudine). The accumulation of three or more TAMs confers resistance to all clinically approved RT inhibitors. Insertions of one or two amino acids, as well as single amino acid deletions in the β3-β4 hairpin loop (residues 64–72), are frequently found in heavily mutated multidrug-resistant HIV-1 isolates from patients that do not respond to the available therapies (19Menéndez-Arias L.

Antiviral Res. 2007; 75: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The prevalence of β3-β4 hairpin loop deletions has been estimated to be less than 0.2% among patients failing antiretroviral treatment including NRTIs (21Winters M.A. Coolley K.L. Cheng P.

These deletions may appear together with mutations of the Q151M complex or with TAMs. The deletion of RT codon 69 (encoding for Thr-69) has been observed in combination with one or more mutations of the Q151M complex in viral isolates resistant to multiple NRTIs (21Winters M.A. Coolley K.L.

The 69 deletion (Δ69) alone confers AZT hypersusceptibility and resistance to β-l-(−)-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC, lamivudine) in phenotypic assays (23Villena C. Prado J.G. Puertas M.C.

Biochemical studies have shown that in the absence of TAMs, Δ69 decreases ATP-mediated excision of primers terminated with AZT as well as the catalytic efficiency of incorporation of 3TC triphosphate (3TCTP) relative to dCTP by the HIV-1 RT (24Kisic M.

Viral isolates lacking the RT codon 67 (Asp-67) showed high level resistance to AZT in phenotypic assays, although their decreased susceptibility could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of TAMs (25Imamichi T.

Recombinant HIV-1 RTs with complex mutational patterns including Δ67 (e.g. M41L/Δ67/T69G/K70R/L74I/K103N/T215Y/K219Q) showed high-level excision activity on primers terminated with AZT, d4T or tenofovir, particularly in the presence of PPi (27Boyer P.L. Imamichi T. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9987-9997Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of excision and nucleotide discrimination mechanisms to resistance mediated by Δ67 has not been studied in detail. In this work, a genotypic analysis of HIV-1 pol sequences of isolates from treated patients shows that there are two major mutational complexes associated with single amino acid deletions at codons 67 or 69 in the β3-β4 hairpin loop of the RT. The Δ67 complex (i.e. Δ67/T69G/K70R) is usually found together with TAMs, while these mutations are rare when Δ69 is present, as for example, in the case of the S68G/Δ69/K70G complex. In previous studies we showed the selection of this mutational complex in a heavily treated patient, infected with drug-resistant HIV-1 bearing mutations A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M in the RT (23Villena C. Prado J.G. Puertas M.C. Martínez M.A. Clotet B. Ruiz L. Parkin N.T. Menéndez-Arias L. Martinez-Picado J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 4713-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Now, we have analyzed the contribution to NRTI excision of such mutational complexes in the presence or absence of TAMs, as well as their role in discriminating against AZT triphosphate (AZTTP).

In the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with dsDNA and dNTP (8Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), the side chain of Lys-219 interacts with the side chain of Asp-67, but this interaction is predicted to be lost in the presence of Δ69 (24Kisic M.

Biol. 2008; 382: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this residue in NRTI excision/incorporation. Recombinant RTs bearing K219E showed altered nucleotide selectivity in the presence of any of both deletion complexes, but decreased ATP-mediated excision only when Δ69 was present. Wild-type (WT) HIV-1NL4–3 and HIV-1BH10 RTs, and mutant derivatives Δ69 (HIV-1NL4–3 RT lacking Thr-69) and M41L/T215Y (in an HIV-1BH10 RT background) were obtained as previously described, using modified versions of plasmid p66RTB (24Kisic M.

Other mutants were obtained by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. Template and primers used in the mutagenesis reaction are given in the supplemental Table S1. Mutant RTs Δ67/T69G/K70R/K219E and S68G/Δ69/K70G/K219E were obtained by introducing the substitution K219E, in previously generated plasmids containing Δ67/T69G/K70R and S68G/Δ69/K70G, respectively. The Δ67 mutant was obtained by reverting to WT sequence the mutations found at positions 69 and 70 in Δ67/T69G/K70R. All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, South Korea). Recombinant heterodimeric RTs were expressed and purified as previously described (30Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal.

Biol. 2005; 349: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RT p66 subunits carrying a His6 tag at their C terminus were co-expressed with HIV-1 protease in Escherichia coli XL1 Blue to obtain p66/p51 heterodimers, which were later purified by ionic exchange followed by affinity chromatography. Enzymes were quantified by active site titration (31Matamoros T. Deval J. Guerreiro C. Mulard L. Canard B. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol.

AZTTP and d4T triphosphate (d4TTP) were obtained from Trilink BioTechnologies (San Diego, CA) and Sierra Bioresearch (Tucson, AZ), respectively. Before use, nucleoside-TPs were treated with inorganic pyrophosphatase to remove traces of PPi (13Mas A. Vázquez-Álvarez B.M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides 21P (3′-CCTATGTATACCAATTTCATA-5′), 31T (3′-TATGAAATTGGTATACATAGGATTTTTTTTT-5′), 25PGA (3′-GGACGTTCTTACATATCGGGATGGT-5′), and D38 (3′-ACCATCCCGATATGTAAGAACGTCCATTCTTTCCTGGG-5′) were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides 21P and 25PGA were labeled at their 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP (Perkin Elmer) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Annealing of template/primers 31T/21P and D38/25PGA was carried out as described (33Martín-Hernández A.M. Gutiérrez-Rivas M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Mendieta J. Cases-González C.E. Matamoros T. Ramírez G. Menéndez-Arias L. Proteins. 2008; 71: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transient kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation were determined with a rapid quench instrument (model QFM-400, Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) with reaction times ranging from 10 ms to 6 s (35Matamoros T. Nevot M. Martínez M.A. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32792-32802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the incorporation of dTTP, reactions were performed at 37 °C by mixing 16 μl of a solution containing 100 nm (active sites) of the corresponding RT and 200 nm of the template/primer 31T/21P in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50 mm KCl) with 16 μl of RT buffer containing variable amounts of dNTP in 25 mm MgCl2. Reactions involving AZTTP were conducted under the same conditions with excess concentrations of enzyme (200 nm) over the template/primer duplex (100 nm). All reactions were stopped with 0.3 m EDTA (final concentration). Aliquots of the reaction products were mixed with equal amounts of a solution containing 10 mm EDTA in 90% (v/v) formamide containing 3 mg/ml of xylene cyanol FF and 3 mg/ml of bromophenol blue. Products were analyzed by sequencing gel electrophoresis (20% (w/v) polyacrylamide/8 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA buffer) and quantified by phosphorimaging with a BAS 1500 scanner (Fuji), using the program Tina version 2.09 (Raytest Isotopenmessgerate Gmbh, Staubenhardt, Germany). The formation of product [P] over time was fitted with burst Equation 1,[P]=A×[1-exp(-kobs×t)]+kSS×tEq. 1 where A is the amplitude of the burst, kobs is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond, and kss is the enzyme turnover rate (i.e. the kinetic constant of the steady-state linear phase). The dependence of kobs on dNTP concentration is described by the hyperbolic Equation 2,kobs=kpol×[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])Eq. 2 where Kd and kpol are the equilibrium and the catalytic rate constants of the dNTP for RT, respectively. Kd and kpol were determined from curve fitting using Sigma Plot. RT-catalyzed DNA rescue reactions were performed with template/primer D38/25PGA as described (24Kisic M. Mendieta J. Puertas M.C. Parera M. Martínez M.A. Martinez-Picado J. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Cases-González C.E. Franco S. Martínez M.A. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA duplex containing the phosphorylated primer (30 nm) and the corresponding RT were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 20 μl of 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) containing 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 130 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. Reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of preincubation buffer containing 50 μm AZTTP or d4TTP, depending on the assay. After incubating the samples at 37 °C for 30 min, the rescue reactions were carried out by adding 40 μl to a mixture of all dNTPs, and the corresponding PPi donor, in the buffer indicated above. PPi donors used were sodium PPi (at 200 μm), ATP (at 3.2 mm) or GTP (at 9.6 mm). In these assays, all dNTPs except dATP were supplied at a final concentration of 100 μm. Because the next complementary dNTP (dATP in our assay conditions) has an inhibitory effect on the reaction, time course experiments of the unblocking and extension reactions were carried out with 1 μm dATP. Active RT concentrations in these assays were in the range of 24 to 72 nm. Rescue reactions were incubated for up to 150 min, and aliquots of 4 μl were removed at appropriate times and added to 12 μl of EDTA/formamide stop solution. Products were then resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels and primer rescue was quantified by phosphorimaging. Structural models of mutant RTs Δ67/T69G/K70R and D67N/K70R were constructed by standard homology modeling techniques (24Kisic M. Mendieta J. Puertas M.C. Parera M. Martínez M.A. Martinez-Picado J. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations, based on the model, were performed as previously described for the WT HIV-1 RT (34Mendieta J. Cases-González C.E. Matamoros T. Ramírez G. Menéndez-Arias L. Proteins. 2008; 71: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The system included the DNA polymerase domain (residues 1–389) of the 66 kDa subunit of the RT, a 15/12-mer DNA/DNA template/primer and residues 3–82 of the 51-kDa subunit of the RT. Two Mg2+ ions and the incoming dNTP were also included in the system. The total simulation length was around 10 ns, and the analysis of trajectories was performed as described (34Mendieta J. Cases-González C.E. Matamoros T. Ramírez G. Menéndez-Arias L. Proteins. 2008; 71: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Resistance to RT inhibitors was determined with a drug susceptibility assay involving the generation of recombinant HIV-1 variants after co-transfecting MT-4 cells with a PCR product containing the RT coding sequence DNA and an RT-deleted HXB2-D clone previously linearized with BstEII (37Kellam P. Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The MT-4 cells and the deleted HXB2-D clone were obtained from the AIDS Reagent Program (Medical Research Council). RT inhibitors and ritonavir were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. After virus propagation and titration, HIV-1 drug susceptibility data were obtained in MT-4 cells as previously described (29Betancor G. Puertas M.C. Nevot M. Garriga C. Martínez M.A. Martinez-Picado J. Menéndez-Arias L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 4799-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The prevalence of deletions in the RT fingers subdomain has been estimated to be less than 0.2% in HIV-infected patients, treated with nucleoside inhibitors (21Winters M.A. Coolley K.L. Cheng P.

Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After searching the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance database, we identified 68 RT sequences containing three-nucleotide deletions in the β3-β4 hairpin loop. Amino acid sequence alignments of the region comprising RT residues 41–220 showed that about one-third of the sequences lacked Asp-67 (or any other acidic residue at positions 64–72) (supplemental Fig. S1). Most of them shared a consensus sequence KKKSGRWR (Δ67/T69G/K70R) for positions 64–72 at the tip of the β3-β4 hairpin loop. On the other hand, sixty percent of the deletion-containing RTs contained Asp-67, and had a consensus sequence KKKDGKWR (S68G/Δ69) at positions 64–72. TAMs were commonly found in the sequences lacking Asp-67. Thus, 69.6% of these sequences contained M41L and 87% contained T215Y. Mutations of the Q151M complex were rarely identified in RTs lacking Asp-67, but K219E or K219Q were found in 22 out of the 23 sequences analyzed. In contrast, 40% of the RTs with the consensus sequence KKKDGKWR (S68G/Δ69) contained Q151M, while TAMs were rarely observed in this group of sequences. The ability of RTs to rescue AZT monophosphate (AZTMP)- and d4T monophosphate (d4TMP)-terminated primers was assessed by using the template/primer shown in Fig. 1A. These experiments were carried out in two steps. First, the enzyme and the template/primer were incubated in the presence of the inhibitor to generate a terminated 26-nucleotide primer. Then, unblocking and extension reactions were carried out by adding a mixture of dNTPs and a PPi donor (ATP or PPi). A mutant RT lacking Asp-67 and having the β3-β4 hairpin loop consensus sequence KKKSGRWR (i.e. mutant Δ67/T69G/K70R) showed relatively high ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity on primers terminated with AZTMP (Fig. 1B). In contrast, WT (NL4–3) RT and mutant RTs Δ67, Δ69, and S68G/Δ69/K70G showed almost negligible activity. Similar results were obtained with primers terminated with d4TMP, although the efficiency of the reaction was reduced (Fig. 1C). After incubating for 30 min under our assay conditions and in the presence of ATP, Δ67/T69G/K70R RT rescued 60% of the AZTMP-terminated primer, but less than 20% of the primer blocked with d4TMP (Fig. 1). A double mutant containing the deletion of codon 67 and K70R also showed detectable ATP-mediated excision activity on both types of hybrids, but its catalytic efficiency was reduced >2-fold in comparison with the Δ67/T69G/K70R RT (data not shown). In the presence of 200 μm PPi all RTs were able to unblock and extend primers blocked with AZTMP or d4TMP, although efficiencies were lower for mutant RTs Δ67 and S68G/Δ69/K70G (rescue rates are given in the supplemental Table S2). Both mutants containing Δ69 produced a small but significant reduction of the ATP-mediated excision activity in comparison with the WT enzyme. The effects of Δ67 and Δ69 on the ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity were also tested in the presence of TAMs M41L and T215Y. The introduction of the Δ67 complex of mutations (Δ67/T69G/K70R) produced a 2-fold increase in the ATP-mediated excision activity on AZTMP- and d4TMP-terminated primers (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the Δ69 complex (i.e. S68G/Δ69/K70G) had an antagonistic effect on the ATP-mediated excision activity of M41L/T215Y RT. These effects were also observed with AZTMP-terminated primers in the presence of PPi, although differences were less pronounced (Fig. 2A). In contrast, all tested enzymes showed similar rescue efficiencies on d4TMP-terminated primers in the presence of PPi (Fig. 2B). These results were consistent with phenotypic susceptibility data showing that mutations S68G/Δ69/K70G resensitize HIV-1 to AZT, while Δ67/T69G/K70R produced a slight increase in AZT resistance (Fig. 3). The effects of the deletions in the viral susceptibility to d4T were relatively small due to inhibition of the excision reaction by the relatively high dNTP levels found in MT-4 cells used in phenotypic assays (38Smith A.J. Scott W.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 1827-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Drug susceptibility measurements obtained with recombinant HIV-1 clones containing RTs M41L/Δ67/T69G/K70R/T215Y, M41L/S68G/Δ69/K70G/T215Y, and M41L/T215Y.

https://openalex.org/W2007029070,"The localization of the platelet glycoprotein GP Ib-IX complex (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX) to membrane lipid domain, also known as glycosphingolipid-enriched membranes (GEMs or raft) lipid domain, is essential for the GP Ib-IX complex mediated platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor (vWf) and subsequent platelet activation. To date, the mechanism for the complex association with the GEMs remains unclear. Although the palmitate modifications of GP Ibβ and GP IX were thought to be critical for the complex presence in the GEMs, we found that the removal of the putative palmitoylation sites of GP Ibβ and GP IX had no effects on the localization of the GP Ib-IX complex to the GEMs. Instead, the disruption of GP Ibα disulfide linkage with GP Ibβ markedly decreased the amount of the GEM-associated GP Ibα without altering the GEM association of GP Ibβ and GP IX. Furthermore, partial dissociation with the GEMs greatly inhibited GP Ibα interaction with vWf at high shear instead of in static condition or under low shear stress. Thus, for the first time, we demonstrated that GP Ibβ/GP IX mediates the disulfide-linked GP Ibα localization to the GEMs, which is critical for vWf interaction at high shear."
