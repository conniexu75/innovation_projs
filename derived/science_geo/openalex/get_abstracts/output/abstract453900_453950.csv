https://openalex.org/W2060484997,"Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy, but it is unclear why inhibition of these ubiquitous regulators should have gene-specific effects in tumor cells. Here, we investigate how inhibition of the widely expressed transcriptional coactivator BRD4 leads to selective inhibition of the MYC oncogene in multiple myeloma (MM). BRD4 and Mediator were found to co-occupy thousands of enhancers associated with active genes. They also co-occupied a small set of exceptionally large super-enhancers associated with genes that feature prominently in MM biology, including the MYC oncogene. Treatment of MM tumor cells with the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 led to preferential loss of BRD4 at super-enhancers and consequent transcription elongation defects that preferentially impacted genes with super-enhancers, including MYC. Super-enhancers were found at key oncogenic drivers in many other tumor cells. These observations have implications for the discovery of cancer therapeutics directed at components of super-enhancers in diverse tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W2108516575,"Gene-expression profiles from over 1,000 colorectal tumors define six subtypes with specific phenotypical features, responses to therapy and clinical progression. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer mortality. Whereas some patients respond well to therapy, others do not, and thus more precise, individualized treatment strategies are needed. To that end, we analyzed gene expression profiles from 1,290 CRC tumors using consensus-based unsupervised clustering. The resultant clusters were then associated with therapeutic response data to the epidermal growth factor receptor–targeted drug cetuximab in 80 patients. The results of these studies define six clinically relevant CRC subtypes. Each subtype shares similarities to distinct cell types within the normal colon crypt and shows differing degrees of 'stemness' and Wnt signaling. Subtype-specific gene signatures are proposed to identify these subtypes. Three subtypes have markedly better disease-free survival (DFS) after surgical resection, suggesting these patients might be spared from the adverse effects of chemotherapy when they have localized disease. One of these three subtypes, identified by filamin A expression, does not respond to cetuximab but may respond to cMET receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the metastatic setting. Two other subtypes, with poor and intermediate DFS, associate with improved response to the chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI1 in adjuvant or metastatic settings. Development of clinically deployable assays for these subtypes and of subtype-specific therapies may contribute to more effective management of this challenging disease."

The creation of a transplantable graft to permanently replace kidney function would address donor organ shortage and the morbidity associated with immunosuppression. Such a bioengineered graft must have the kidney's architecture and function and permit perfusion, filtration, secretion, absorption and drainage of urine. We decellularized rat, porcine and human kidneys by detergent perfusion, yielding acellular scaffolds with vascular, cortical and medullary architecture, a collecting system and ureters. To regenerate functional tissue, we seeded rat kidney scaffolds with epithelial and endothelial cells and perfused these cell-seeded constructs in a whole-organ bioreactor. The resulting grafts produced rudimentary urine in vitro when perfused through their intrinsic vascular bed. When transplanted in an orthotopic position in rat, the grafts were perfused by the recipient's circulation and produced urine through the ureteral conduit in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2035346960,"The most common pediatric brain tumors are low-grade gliomas (LGGs). We used whole-genome sequencing to identify multiple new genetic alterations involving BRAF, RAF1, FGFR1, MYB, MYBL1 and genes with histone-related functions, including H3F3A and ATRX, in 39 LGGs and low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). Only a single non-silent somatic alteration was detected in 24 of 39 (62%) tumors. Intragenic duplications of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB were recurrent and mutually exclusive in 53% of grade II diffuse LGGs. Transplantation of Trp53-null neonatal astrocytes expressing FGFR1 with the duplication involving the TKD into the brains of nude mice generated high-grade astrocytomas with short latency and 100% penetrance. FGFR1 with the duplication induced FGFR1 autophosphorylation and upregulation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways, which could be blocked by specific inhibitors. Focusing on the therapeutically challenging diffuse LGGs, our study of 151 tumors has discovered genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets across the entire range of pediatric LGGs and LGGNTs."
https://openalex.org/W2163016920,"Brain rhythms regulate information processing in different states to enable learning and memory formation. The <1 Hz sleep slow oscillation hallmarks slow-wave sleep and is critical to memory consolidation. Here we show in sleeping humans that auditory stimulation in phase with the ongoing rhythmic occurrence of slow oscillation up states profoundly enhances the slow oscillation rhythm, phase-coupled spindle activity, and, consequently, the consolidation of declarative memory. Stimulation out of phase with the ongoing slow oscillation rhythm remained ineffective. Closed-loop in-phase stimulation provides a straight-forward tool to enhance sleep rhythms and their functional efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1999353686,"In vertebrates, activation of innate immunity is an early response to injury, implicating it in the regenerative process. However, the mechanisms by which innate signals might regulate stem cell functionality are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that type 2 innate immunity is required for regeneration of skeletal muscle after injury. Muscle damage results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, which secrete IL-4 to activate the regenerative actions of muscle resident fibro/adipocyte progenitors (FAPs). In FAPs, IL-4/IL-13 signaling serves as a key switch to control their fate and functions. Activation of IL-4/IL-13 signaling promotes proliferation of FAPs to support myogenesis while inhibiting their differentiation into adipocytes. Surprisingly, type 2 cytokine signaling is also required in FAPs, but not in myeloid cells, for rapid clearance of necrotic debris, a process that is necessary for timely and complete regeneration of tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2080844075,"The functions of Nr4a1-dependent Ly6Clow monocytes remain enigmatic. We show that they are enriched within capillaries and scavenge microparticles from their lumenal side in a steady state. In the kidney cortex, perturbation of homeostasis by a TLR7-dependent nucleic acid “danger” signal, which may signify viral infection or local cell death, triggers Gαi-dependent intravascular retention of Ly6Clow monocytes by the endothelium. Then, monocytes recruit neutrophils in a TLR7-dependent manner to mediate focal necrosis of endothelial cells, whereas the monocytes remove cellular debris. Prevention of Ly6Clow monocyte development, crawling, or retention in Nr4a1−/−, Itgal−/−, and Tlr7host−/−BM+/+ and Cx3cr1−/− mice, respectively, abolished neutrophil recruitment and endothelial killing. Prevention of neutrophil recruitment in Tlr7host+/+BM−/− mice or by neutrophil depletion also abolished endothelial cell necrosis. Therefore, Ly6Clow monocytes are intravascular housekeepers that orchestrate the necrosis by neutrophils of endothelial cells that signal a local threat sensed via TLR7 followed by the in situ phagocytosis of cellular debris.

Inflammatory signals, such as chemokines, promote leucocyte diapedesis into damaged and infected tissues in order to recruit neutrophils within a few hours and “inflammatory” lymphocyte antigen 6c (Ly6C)+ monocytes 1 day later, herein initiating a cellular immune response (Auffray et al., 2009bAuffray C.

Ly6C+ monocytes exit the bone marrow and extravasate into peripheral inflamed tissues, partly in response to chemokines that signal via C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) (Serbina and Pamer, 2006Serbina N.V.

Ly6C+ monocytes are also directly recruited to draining lymph nodes via the high endothelial venules (Palframan et al., 2001Palframan R.T. Jung S. Cheng G. Weninger W. Luo Y. Dorf M. Littman D.R. Rollins B.J. Zweerink H. Rot A. von Andrian U.H. Inflammatory chemokine transport and presentation in HEV: a remote control mechanism for monocyte recruitment to lymph nodes in inflamed tissues.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). They can produce type 1 interferons in response to viruses via a toll-like receptor 2-dependent pathway (Barbalat et al., 2009Barbalat R. Lau L. Locksley R.M. Barton G.M.

It is also believed that Ly6C+ monocytes play a role in chronic inflammation, such as the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque, because Ccr2-deficient mice on low density lipoprotein receptor- or apolipoprotein E-deficient backgrounds and a high-fat diet have decreased atherosclerosis (Boring et al., 1998Boring L.

A second population of blood major histocompatability complex (MHC) class IInegative myeloid cells, which lack the Ly6C antigen (and, thus, are termed Ly6Clow or Gr1low monocytes), represents a distinct monocyte subset. They develop normally in Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− mice, which lack lymphoid cells (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A. Lauvau G. Geissmann F. Monitoring of blood vessels and tissues by a population of monocytes with patrolling behavior.Science. 2007; 317: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). They are characterized by high expression of the C-X3-C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and require the transcription factor Nr4a1 for their development from proliferating bone marrow precursors (Geissmann et al., 2003Geissmann F.

They crawl along the endothelium of blood vessels in a steady state, express a full set of Fcγ receptors, and mediate IgG-dependent effector functions in mice (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C. Fogg D.

Immunol. 2010; 185: 7057-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These Ly6Clow “patrolling” monocytes do not appear to share the functional properties of Ly6C+ monocytes. They do not differentiate into inflammatory macrophages or DCs following Listeria infection, and their extravasation is a rare event in comparison to Ly6C+ monocytes (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A. Lauvau G. Geissmann F. Monitoring of blood vessels and tissues by a population of monocytes with patrolling behavior.Science. 2007; 317: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Ly6Clow monocytes were suggested to contribute to tissue repair in the myocardium (Nahrendorf et al., 2007Nahrendorf M. Swirski F.K. Aikawa E. Stangenberg L. Wurdinger T. Figueiredo J.L. Libby P. Weissleder R. Pittet M.J. The healing myocardium sequentially mobilizes two monocyte subsets with divergent and complementary functions.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 3037-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar), and, in contrast to Ccr2-deficient mice, Nr4a1-deficient mice showed increased atherosclerosis (Hamers et al., 2012Hamers A.A. Vos M. Rassam F. Marinković G. Kurakula K. van Gorp P.J. de Winther M.P. Gijbels M.J. de Waard V. de Vries C.J.

Hubbeling H.G. Punt J.A. Wu R. Herrley E. Zaugg C. Pei H. Geissmann F. Ley K. Hedrick C.C. NR4A1 (Nur77) deletion polarizes macrophages toward an inflammatory phenotype and increases atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2012; 110: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, initial data suggested that Ly6Clow monocytes may represent an “anti-inflammatory” subset. However, this hypothesis failed to explain a large number of observations. For example, limiting the recruitment of Ly6Clow monocytes after traumatic spinal cord injury was proposed to contribute decreasing inflammation in this model (Donnelly et al., 2011Donnelly D.J. Longbrake E.E. Shawler T.M. Kigerl K.A. Lai W. Tovar C.A. Ransohoff R.M. Popovich P.G. Deficient CX3CR1 signaling promotes recovery after mouse spinal cord injury by limiting the recruitment and activation of Ly6Clo/iNOS+ macrophages.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9910-9922Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Several studies on mouse models of lupus nephritis also suggested a proinflammatory role of Ly6Clow monocytes, in part via their activation by immune complexes containing nucleic acids (Amano et al., 2005Amano H. Amano E. Santiago-Raber M.L. Moll T. Martinez-Soria E. Fossati-Jimack L. Iwamoto M. Rozzo S.J. Kotzin B.L. Izui S.

Takasaki Y. et al.Fcgamma receptor-dependent expansion of a hyperactive monocyte subset in lupus-prone mice.Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize, in several of its key molecular mechanisms, the role of Ly6Clow Nr4a1-dependent monocytes in vivo as “accessory cells” of the endothelium. Ly6Clow monocytes scan capillaries and scavenge micrometric particles from their lumenal side in a steady state. A local nucleic-acid-mediated TLR7 “danger” signal increases their dwell time on the endothelium, a site at which they orchestrate the focal necrosis of endothelial cells that have recruited them, by recruiting neutrophils. TLR7-dependent necrosis is rapid, performed without extravasation, and leaves the basal lamina, tubular epithelium, and glomerular structures intact, at least initially. Phagocytosis of cellular debris suggests that Ly6Clow monocytes promote the safe disposal of endothelial cells at the site of recruitment. Therefore, Ly6Clow monocytes behave as “housekeepers” of the vasculature, although it is easy to conceive that their action might cause damage itself if the danger signal persists. Monocytes that adhere to the lumenal side of the endothelium of dermal and heart capillaries, cremaster, mesenteric vessels, and glomeruli in the steady state have been identified by intravital microscopy as CX3CR1high CD11b (αM integrin)+ F4/80+ leucocytes (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C.

Crawling CD11b+ CX3CR1high monocytes are also present in the vascular network that ramifies around renal tubules in the kidney cortex (Figures 1A and 1B ; Movie S1 available online). Analysis of monocyte tethering and adhesion in vivo indicated that crawling Ly6Clow monocytes are in constant exchange between the bloodstream and the endothelium, having an average dwell time of 9 min in the kidney microvasculature (Figure 1C; Movies S2 and S3; also see Figure 3). Intravital imaging combined with intravenous (i.v.) immunolabeling of monocytes confirmed that all monocytes that crawled on the endothelium in a steady state expressed CD11b and CX3CR1 and lacked detectable Ly6C staining (Figure 1D; Movies S2, S4, and S5). To investigate the extent of the association of monocytes with the endothelium of the microvasculature in a steady state, we compared the number of monocytes per μl volume in the peripheral blood, the vasculature of the mesentery, and the capillaries of the dermis (ear) and kidney cortex. The number of crawling of Ly6Clow CD11b+ CX3CR1high monocytes/μl was at least one order of magnitude higher in the dermal and kidney cortex capillaries (103 to 104 monocytes/μl) than the number of Ly6Clow CD11b+ CX3CR1high monocytes in the peripheral blood (102 monocytes/μl) (Figure 1A). Antibody blockade of αL integrin (CD11a) detached monocytes from the vessel wall in vivo (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A.

The characteristic slow motion (10–16 μm/min) and complex tracks, which include U-turns and spirals, of Ly6Clow monocytes crawling along the endothelium suggested that they survey the endothelium (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A. Lauvau G. Geissmann F. Monitoring of blood vessels and tissues by a population of monocytes with patrolling behavior.Science. 2007; 317: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Intravital microscopy, image deconvolution, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that the crawling monocytes extended numerous and mobile filopodia-like structures in contact with the endothelium in the dermal and kidney cortex blood vessels of Cx3cr1gfp/+;Rag2−/−;Il2rg−/− mice (Figures 1E, 1H, and 1I; Movies S1 and S6). These filopodia or “dendrites” were also observed on human CD14dim monocytes spreading in vitro and stained positively for LFA1 and filamentous actin (Figure S1). Crawling monocytes scavenged 0.2 μm and 2 μm beads that attach to the capillary endothelium in the kidney cortex following i.v. injection, as well as high-molecular-weight dextran (2 MDa; Figures 1F and 1G; Movie S7). Uptake was not followed by their immediate detachment or extravasation. Rather, they can be seen crawling, or patrolling, on the endothelium while carrying their cargo for an extended period of time (e.g., >25 min in Movie S7). Consistently, mononuclear cells with the round or bean-shaped nuclei and granule-poor cytoplasm typical of Ly6Clow monocytes (Geissmann et al., 2003Geissmann F. Jung S. Littman D.R. Blood monocytes consist of two principal subsets with distinct migratory properties.Immunity. 2003; 19: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar) were observed in steady-state kidney capillaries by TEM. These cells were monocytic, not lymphoid, given that they were present in Rag2−/−;Il2rg−/− mice. Pseudopodia that attached to the endothelium, and large endosomes that contained endogenous debris/microparticles were evident (Figures 1H and 1I). Thus, Ly6Clow monocytes scan the lumenal side of “resting” endothelial cells and uptake submicrometric and micrometric particles. Consistent with antibody blockade of LFA1 (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A. Lauvau G. Geissmann F. Monitoring of blood vessels and tissues by a population of monocytes with patrolling behavior.Science. 2007; 317: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), monocyte attachment to the endothelium was reduced to 1% of wild-type (WT) in Itgal−/− mice, whereas monocyte subsets were normally present in the peripheral blood (Figures 2A and 2B ). Track analysis of intravital imaging experiments (Figure 2B; Movie S4) comparing Itgal−/− mice and their WT littermates demonstrated that αL integrin was absolutely required for monocyte crawling. The few remaining Itgal−/− monocytes that attached to the endothelium passively followed the blood flow (Figure 2B). LFA1 (αLβ2 integrin) accepts several ligands, including ICAM1, ICAM2, ICAM3, and JAM-A (de Fougerolles et al., 1993de Fougerolles A.R. Klickstein L.B. Springer T.A.

Crawling monocytes were still present in Icam1−/− mice, though they were reduced by 50%, and were normally present in Icam2−/− mice (Figure 2C). However, monocyte attachment to the endothelium was reduced to 2% of control in Icam1/2−/− double mutant mice, and the remaining adherent monocytes passively followed the blood flow, a phenocopy of the Itgal−/− mutant (Figure 2C). Thus, LFA1 and its ligand ICAM1—or ICAM2 in ICAM1-deficient mice—mediate adhesion and crawling of Ly6Clow monocytes to the endothelium. Chemokine receptor Ccr2 deficiency decreased by half the number of circulating Ly6C+ monocytes (Serbina and Pamer, 2006Serbina N.V. Pamer E.G. Monocyte emigration from bone marrow during bacterial infection requires signals mediated by chemokine receptor CCR2.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), which are proposed to represent a precursor for Ly6Clow monocytes (Varol et al., 2007Varol C. Landsman L. Fogg D.K.

Med. 2007; 204: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ccr2, Ly6C+ monocytes were decreased by ∼50%, as described, but the numbers of Ly6Clow monocytes in the bloodstream and crawling on the endothelium were unaffected in comparison to control monocytes (Figures 2D and 2E). Cx3cr1 deficiency was reported to moderately decrease the numbers of circulating and crawling Ly6Clow monocytes (Auffray et al., 2007Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S.

Jung S. CX3CR1 is required for monocyte homeostasis and atherogenesis by promoting cell survival.Blood. 2009; 113: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cx3cr1-deficient crawling monocytes displayed a normal patrolling motility and filopodia formation in vivo (Figure 2F), despite their number being reduced. Therefore, monocyte crawling on the endothelium does not require Cx3cr1 or Ccr2. To test whether another chemokine, or a combination of chemokines, may be responsible for LFA1 activation and binding to ICAM1 and/or ICAM2, we performed intravital imaging experiments in mice after i.v. injection of pertussis toxin (PT), a potent inhibitor of Gαi signaling. PT treatment (up to 100 μg/mouse) did not affect the adhesion and crawling of monocytes on the endothelium (Figure 2G). Thus, it is unlikely that PT-sensitive chemokine receptor signaling controls the adhesion of Ly6Clow monocytes to the endothelium in a steady state. A positive control for the effect of PT is shown in Figure 4. The transcription factor Nr4a1 is important for the development of Ly6Clow monocytes from their bone marrow precursors in mice; circulating and crawling Ly6Clow monocytes being reduced by 90% in Nr4a1-deficient mice (Hanna et al., 2011Hanna R.N. Carlin L.M. Hubbeling H.G. Nackiewicz D. Green A.M. Punt J.A. Geissmann F. Hedrick C.C. The transcription factor NR4A1 (Nur77) controls bone marrow differentiation and the survival of Ly6C- monocytes.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Additional analysis indicated that CX3CR1high Ly6Clow CD11b+ I-A− (MHCII−) monocytes were, in fact, virtually absent from the blood and from the endothelium of Nr4a1−/− mice (Figures 2H and 2I). The remaining 5%–10% of Ly6Clow CD11b+ cells in the blood have a distinct phenotype in addition to being Nr4a1 independent; they express I-A and intermediate levels of CX3CR1 and may represent a previously unrecognized subset of blood myeloid cells independent of both Ccr2 and Nr4a1 (Figure 2J, also see Figure S1), which will not be discussed further in this report. Thus, Nr4a1-dependent monocytes scavenge the lumenal side of the endothelium in a steady state via a process that requires LFA1 with ICAM1 or ICAM2 interaction but not chemokine-receptor signaling. To evaluate the response of the patrolling monocytes to TLR-mediated signal in vivo, we painted the kidney capsule of Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice with R848 (Resiquimod, a selective ligand for TLR7 in mouse), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or PBS as a control (Figure S2). After R848 painting, the tracks of crawling monocytes inside capillaries increased in length, and their velocity decreased slightly (Figures 3A and 3B ; Movie S8). The duration of their attachment to the endothelium, or dwell time, increased 2- to 3-fold (Figure 3C). This resulted in a rapid, sustained, time- and TLR7-dependent increase in their number within the peritubular capillaries, which was very significantly different from the slight increase observed 3 hr after PBS painting (the latter possibly being due to phototoxicity) (Figure 3D). Retention of crawling monocytes inside capillaries was dependent on local TLR7 signaling, because there was no monocyte retention in Cx3cr1gfp/+;Tlr7−/− mice in comparison to Cx3cr1gfp/+;Tlr7+/+ controls (Figures 3A–3D), although steady-state crawling itself was TLR7-independent (Figures 3A–3D; Movie S8), and because there was no significant monocyte retention in kidney capillaries after i.v. injection of R848 (Figure 3D). In addition, LPS painting did not increase the number of crawling monocytes, in comparison to PBS control (R848-positive control is also shown for clarity; Figure 3D). I.v. injection of labeled antibodies against CD11b 4.5 hr after R848 painting indicated that crawling GFP+ CD11b+ cells were located inside capillaries (Figure 3E; Movie S9). Moreover, the increase in GFP+ cells during the 4.5 hr of the experiment could be wholly accounted for by CD11b-labeled cells, indicating that the crawling monocytes had remained within the vascular lumen (Figure 3F).Figure 3Retention of Crawling Monocytes in the Kidney Vasculature in Response to TLR7 AgonistShow full caption(A) Representative monocyte tracks and vectors in the kidney cortex after painting with PBS or R848 in Tlr7+/+ and Tlr7−/− mice over 5 hr. n = 3 or 4 mice per condition The scale bar represents 40 μm.(B) Track length and speed for monocytes from the experiments described in (A)"
https://openalex.org/W1997572777,"NLRP3 is a key component of the macromolecular signaling complex called the inflammasome that promotes caspase 1-dependent production of IL-1β. The adaptor ASC is necessary for NLRP3-dependent inflammasome function, but it is not known whether ASC is a sufficient partner and whether inflammasome formation occurs in the cytosol or in association with mitochondria is controversial. Here, we show that the mitochondria-associated adaptor molecule, MAVS, is required for optimal NLRP3 inflammasome activity. MAVS mediates recruitment of NLRP3 to mitochondria, promoting production of IL-1β and the pathophysiologic activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo. Our data support a more complex model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation than previously appreciated, with at least two adapters required for maximal function. Because MAVS is a mitochondria-associated molecule previously considered to be uniquely involved in type 1 interferon production, these findings also reveal unexpected polygamous involvement of PYD/CARD-domain-containing adapters in innate immune signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W2129443010,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) constitutes a critical host defense against tuberculosis, but its excess is also implicated in tuberculosis pathogenesis in zebrafish and humans. Using the zebrafish, we elucidate the pathways by which TNF mediates tuberculosis pathogenesis. TNF excess induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected macrophages through RIP1-RIP3-dependent pathways. While initially increasing macrophage microbicidal activity, ROS rapidly induce programmed necrosis (necroptosis) and release mycobacteria into the growth-permissive extracellular milieu. TNF-induced necroptosis occurs through two pathways: modulation of mitochondrial cyclophilin D, implicated in mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation, and acid sphingomyelinase-mediated ceramide production. Combined genetic blockade of cyclophilin D and acid sphingomyelinase renders the high TNF state hyperresistant by preventing macrophage necrosis while preserving increased microbicidal activity. Similarly, the cyclophilin D-inhibiting drug alisporivir and the acid sphingomyelinase-inactivating drug, desipramine, synergize to reverse susceptibility, suggesting the therapeutic potential of these orally active drugs against tuberculosis and possibly other TNF-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2009502003,"The fair-sampling loophole is closed in a Bell inequality violation experiment with entangled photons, making the photon the first physical system for which all the main loopholes have been closed. So-called Bell experiments are used to discriminate between classical ('local realistic') and quantum models of measurable phenomena. In practice, they are subject to various loopholes (arising from non-ideal experimental conditions) that can render the results inconclusive. These authors used a highly efficient source of photon pairs and superconducting transition-edge sensors in a Bell inequality experiment that closes the 'fair-sampling' loophole for entangled photons. The results conflict with local realism, while making the photon the first physical system for which each of the main loopholes has been closed, albeit in different experiments. The violation of a Bell inequality is an experimental observation that forces the abandonment of a local realistic viewpoint—namely, one in which physical properties are (probabilistically) defined before and independently of measurement, and in which no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light1,2. All such experimental violations require additional assumptions depending on their specific construction, making them vulnerable to so-called loopholes. Here we use entangled photons to violate a Bell inequality while closing the fair-sampling loophole, that is, without assuming that the sample of measured photons accurately represents the entire ensemble3. To do this, we use the Eberhard form of Bell’s inequality, which is not vulnerable to the fair-sampling assumption and which allows a lower collection efficiency than other forms4. Technical improvements of the photon source5,6 and high-efficiency transition-edge sensors7 were crucial for achieving a sufficiently high collection efficiency. Our experiment makes the photon the first physical system for which each of the main loopholes has been closed, albeit in different experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2009576434,"CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) systems are a bacterial defence against invading foreign nucleic acids derived from bacteriophages or exogenous plasmids. These systems use an array of small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) consisting of repetitive sequences flanking unique spacers to recognize their targets, and conserved Cas proteins to mediate target degradation. Recent studies have suggested that these systems may have broader functions in bacterial physiology, and it is unknown if they regulate expression of endogenous genes. Here we demonstrate that the Cas protein Cas9 of Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein. As bacterial lipoproteins trigger a proinflammatory innate immune response aimed at combating pathogens, CRISPR/Cas-mediated repression of bacterial lipoprotein expression is critical for F. novicida to dampen this host response and promote virulence. Because Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria, our work indicates that CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may broadly contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during the interaction of such bacteria with eukaryotic hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2030513330,"To gain insight into the cellular readout of DNA methylation, we established a strategy for systematically profiling the genome-wide distribution of chromatin-interacting factors. This enabled us to create genomic maps for the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins, including disease-relevant mutants, deletions, and isoforms. In vivo binding of MBD proteins occurs predominantly as a linear function of local methylation density, requiring functional MBD domains and methyl-CPGs. This interaction directs specificity of MBD proteins to methylated, CpG-dense, and inactive regulatory regions. In contrast, binding to unmethylated sites varies between MBD proteins and is mediated via alternative domains or protein-protein interactions. Such targeting is exemplified by NuRD-complex-mediated tethering of MBD2 to a subset of unmethylated, active regulatory regions. Interestingly, MBD3 also occupies these sites, but like MBD2, binding is independent of the presence of hydroxymethylation. These functional binding maps reveal methylation-dependent and -independent binding modes and revise current models of DNA methylation readout through MBD proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2138035159,"Factors that sustain self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are well described. In contrast, the machinery regulating exit from pluripotency is ill defined. In a large-scale small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen, we found that knockdown of the tumor suppressors Folliculin (Flcn) and Tsc2 prevent ESC commitment. Tsc2 lies upstream of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas Flcn acts downstream and in parallel. Flcn with its interaction partners Fnip1 and Fnip2 drives differentiation by restricting nuclear localization and activity of the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3. Conversely, enforced nuclear Tfe3 enables ESCs to withstand differentiation conditions. Genome-wide location and functional analyses showed that Tfe3 directly integrates into the pluripotency circuitry through transcriptional regulation of Esrrb. These findings identify a cell-intrinsic rheostat for destabilizing ground-state pluripotency to allow lineage commitment. Congruently, stage-specific subcellular relocalization of Tfe3 suggests that Flcn-Fnip1/2 contributes to developmental progression of the pluripotent epiblast in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2088148170,"Amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ42) oligomers are synaptotoxic for excitatory cortical and hippocampal neurons and might play a role in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Recent results suggested that Aβ42 oligomers trigger activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), and its activation is increased in the brain of patients with AD. We show that increased intracellular calcium [Ca²⁺](i) induced by NMDA receptor activation or membrane depolarization activates AMPK in a CAMKK2-dependent manner. CAMKK2 or AMPK overactivation is sufficient to induce dendritic spine loss. Conversely, inhibiting their activity protects hippocampal neurons against synaptotoxic effects of Aβ42 oligomers in vitro and against the loss of dendritic spines observed in the human APP(SWE,IND)-expressing transgenic mouse model in vivo. AMPK phosphorylates Tau on KxGS motif S262, and expression of Tau S262A inhibits the synaptotoxic effects of Aβ42 oligomers. Our results identify a CAMKK2-AMPK-Tau pathway as a critical mediator of the synaptotoxic effects of Aβ42 oligomers."

Forced expression of the three transcription factors Sox10, Olig2 and Zfp536 was sufficient to reprogram mouse and rat fibroblasts into iOPCs with morphologies and gene expression signatures resembling primary OPCs. More importantly, iOPCs gave rise to mature oligodendrocytes that could ensheath multiple host axons when co-cultured with primary dorsal root ganglion cells and formed myelin after transplantation into shiverer mice. We propose direct lineage reprogramming as a viable alternative approach for the generation of OPCs for use in disease modeling and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2142679888,"Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that interact with presynaptic neurexins. Rare mutations in neuroligins and neurexins predispose to autism, including a neuroligin-3 amino acid substitution (R451C) and a neuroligin-3 deletion. Previous analyses showed that neuroligin-3 R451C-knockin mice exhibit robust synaptic phenotypes but failed to uncover major changes in neuroligin-3 knockout mice, questioning the notion that a common synaptic mechanism mediates autism pathogenesis in patients with these mutations. Here, we used paired recordings in mice carrying these mutations to measure synaptic transmission at GABAergic synapses formed by hippocampal parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells onto pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that in addition to unique gain-of-function effects produced by the neuroligin-3 R451C-knockin but not the neuroligin-3 knockout mutation, both mutations dramatically impaired tonic but not phasic endocannabinoid signaling. Our data thus suggest that neuroligin-3 is specifically required for tonic endocannabinoid signaling, raising the possibility that alterations in endocannabinoid signaling may contribute to autism pathophysiology."

They can be expanded in vitro for at least five passages while retaining the ability to differentiate into multiprocessed oligodendrocytes. When transplanted to hypomyelinated mice, iOPCs are capable of ensheathing host axons and generating compact myelin. Lineage conversion of somatic cells to expandable iOPCs provides a strategy to study the molecular control of oligodendrocyte lineage identity and may facilitate neurological disease modeling and autologous remyelinating therapies."

By integrating data from chromatin state maps, custom microarrays, and FACS purification of the subventricular zone lineage, we stringently identify lncRNAs with potential roles in adult neurogenesis. shRNA-mediated knockdown of two such lncRNAs, Six3os and Dlx1as, indicate roles for lncRNAs in the glial-neuronal lineage specification of multipotent adult stem cells.

Here, we seek to address this by searching for evidence of evolutionary selection for ordered protein complex assembly. First, we experimentally characterize the assembly pathways of several heteromeric complexes and show that they can be simply predicted from their three-dimensional structures. Then, by mapping gene fusion events identified from fully sequenced genomes onto protein complex assembly pathways, we demonstrate evolutionary selection for conservation of assembly order. Furthermore, using structural and high-throughput interaction data, we show that fusion tends to optimize assembly by simplifying protein complex topologies. Finally, we observe protein structural constraints on the gene order of fusion that impact the potential for fusion to affect assembly. Together, these results reveal the intimate relationships among protein assembly, quaternary structure, and evolution and demonstrate on a genome-wide scale the biological importance of ordered assembly pathways."

We show that the glucose-6-P-responsive small RNA SgrS activates YigL synthesis in a translation-independent fashion by the selective stabilization of a decay intermediate of the dicistronic pldB-yigL messenger RNA (mRNA). Intriguingly, the major endoribonuclease RNase E, previously known to function together with small RNAs to degrade mRNA targets, is also essential for this process of mRNA activation. The exploitation of and targeted interference with regular RNA turnover described here may constitute a general route for small RNAs to rapidly activate both coding and noncoding genes."
https://openalex.org/W2044237166,"Neuronal microtubules support intracellular transport, facilitate axon growth, and form a basis for neuronal morphology. While microtubules in nonneuronal cells are depolymerized by cold, Ca(2+), or antimitotic drugs, neuronal microtubules are unusually stable. Such stability is important for normal axon growth and maintenance, while hyperstability may compromise neuronal function in aging and degeneration. Though mechanisms for stability are unclear, studies suggest that stable microtubules contain biochemically distinct tubulins that are more basic than conventional tubulins. Transglutaminase-catalyzed posttranslational incorporation of polyamines is one of the few modifications of intracellular proteins that add positive charges. Here we show that neuronal tubulin can be polyaminated by transglutaminase. Endogenous brain transglutaminase-catalyzed polyaminated tubulins have the biochemical characteristics of neuronal stable microtubules. Inhibiting polyamine synthesis or transglutaminase activity significantly decreases microtubule stability in vitro and in vivo.

A decrease in CMA activity occurs in aging and in age-related disorders (for example, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes). Although prevention of this age-dependent decline through genetic manipulation in mice has proven beneficial, chemical modulation of CMA is not currently possible, owing in part to the lack of information on the signaling mechanisms that modulate this pathway. In this work, we report that signaling through retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) inhibits CMA and apply structure-based chemical design to develop synthetic derivatives of all-trans-retinoic acid to specifically neutralize this inhibitory effect. We demonstrate that chemical enhancement of CMA protects cells from oxidative stress and from proteotoxicity, supporting a potential therapeutic opportunity when reduced CMA contributes to cellular dysfunction and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2050173346,"Nan Wang and colleagues uncover a new function for HDL that may contribute to its anti-atherosclerotic effects. In the bone marrow, HDL removes cholesterol from megakaryocyte progenitor cells in a process requiring the cholesterol transporter ABCG4, thereby dampening megakaryocyte and platelet production. Platelets have a key role in atherogenesis and its complications. Both hypercholesterolemia and increased platelet production promote atherothrombosis; however, a potential link between altered cholesterol homeostasis and platelet production has not been explored. Here we show that transplantation of bone marrow deficient in ABCG4, a transporter of unknown function, into Ldlr−/− mice resulted in thrombocytosis, accelerated thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Although not detected in atherosclerotic lesions, Abcg4 was highly expressed in bone marrow megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs). Abcg4−/− MkPs had defective cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), increased cell surface expression of the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (c-MPL) and enhanced proliferation. These consequences of ABCG4 deficiency seemed to reflect disruption of negative feedback regulation of c-MPL signaling by the E3 ligase c-CBL and the cholesterol-sensing LYN kinase. HDL infusion reduced platelet counts in Ldlr−/− mice and in a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasm in an ABCG4-dependent fashion. HDL infusions may offer a new approach to reducing atherothrombotic events associated with increased platelet production."

Our studies identify the dual-specific kinase MKK4 as a master regulator of liver regeneration. MKK4 silencing robustly increased the regenerative capacity of hepatocytes in mouse models of liver regeneration and acute and chronic liver failure.

https://openalex.org/W1965673611,"Here, we demonstrate that the fractalkine (FKN)/CX3CR1 system represents a regulatory mechanism for pancreatic islet β cell function and insulin secretion. CX3CR1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited a marked defect in glucose and GLP1-stimulated insulin secretion, and this defect was also observed in vitro in isolated islets from CX3CR1 KO mice. In vivo administration of FKN improved glucose tolerance with an increase in insulin secretion. In vitro treatment of islets with FKN increased intracellular Ca(2+) and potentiated insulin secretion in both mouse and human islets. The KO islets exhibited reduced expression of a set of genes necessary for the fully functional, differentiated β cell state, whereas treatment of wild-type (WT) islets with FKN led to increased expression of these genes. Lastly, expression of FKN in islets was decreased by aging and high-fat diet/obesity, suggesting that decreased FKN/CX3CR1 signaling could be a mechanism underlying β cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes."

Hand grasp is a skilled motor behavior known to require cutaneous sensory feedback, but spinal microcircuits that process and relay this feedback to the motor system have not been defined. We sought to define classes of spinal interneurons involved in the cutaneous control of hand grasp in mice and to show that dI3 interneurons, a class of dorsal spinal interneurons marked by the expression of Isl1, convey input from low threshold cutaneous afferents to motoneurons. Mice in which the output of dI3 interneurons has been inactivated exhibit deficits in motor tasks that rely on cutaneous afferent input. Most strikingly, the ability to maintain grip strength in response to increasing load is lost following genetic silencing of dI3 interneuron output. Thus, spinal microcircuits that integrate cutaneous feedback crucial for paw grip rely on the intermediary role of dI3 interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2034330475,"Mutant p53 proteins are expressed at high frequency in human tumors and are associated with poor clinical prognosis and resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments. Here we show that mutant p53 proteins downregulate micro-RNA (miR)-223 expression in breast and colon cancer cell lines. Mutant p53 binds the miR-223 promoter and reduces its transcriptional activity. This requires the transcriptional repressor ZEB-1. We found that miR-223 exogenous expression sensitizes breast and colon cancer cell lines expressing mutant p53 to treatment with DNA-damaging drugs. Among the putative miR-223 targets, we focused on stathmin-1 (STMN-1), an oncoprotein known to confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs associated with poor clinical prognosis. Mutant p53 silencing or miR-223 exogenous expression lowers the levels of STMN-1 and knockdown of STMN-1 by small interfering RNA increases cell death of mutant p53-expressing cell lines. On the basis of these findings, we propose that one of the pathways affected by mutant p53 to increase cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic agents involves miR-223 downregulation and the consequent upregulation of STMN-1."

Current research and models have largely focused on the former problem of how actions are directed while overlooking the latter problem of how they are energized. Here we designed a self-paced decision-making paradigm, which showed that rats' performance vigor globally fluctuates with the net value of their options, suggesting that they maintain long-term estimates of the value of their current state. Lesions of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and, to a lesser degree, in the ventral striatum impaired such state-dependent modulation of vigor, rendering vigor to depend more exclusively on the outcomes of immediately preceding trials. The lesions, however, spared choice biases. Neuronal recordings showed that the DMS is enriched in net value-coding neurons. In sum, the DMS encodes one's net expected return, which drives the general motivation to perform."
https://openalex.org/W2135109255,"The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is activated in cancer cells by ZEB1, a member of the zinc finger/homeodomain family of transcriptional repressors. The mucin 1 (MUC1) heterodimeric protein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinoma cells. The present studies in breast cancer cells demonstrate that the oncogenic MUC1-C subunit induces expression of ZEB1 by a NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) p65-dependent mechanism. MUC1-C occupies the ZEB1 promoter with NF-κB p65 and thereby promotes ZEB1 transcription. In turn, ZEB1 associates with MUC1-C and the ZEB1/MUC1-C complex contributes to the transcriptional suppression of miR-200c, an inducer of epithelial differentiation. The co-ordinate upregulation of ZEB1 and suppression of miR-200c has been linked to the induction of EMT. In concert with the effects of MUC1-C on ZEB1 and miR-200c, we show that MUC1-C induces EMT and cellular invasion by a ZEB1-mediated mechanism. These findings indicate that (i) MUC1-C activates ZEB1 and suppresses miR-200c with the induction of EMT and (ii) targeting MUC1-C could be an effective approach for the treatment of breast and possibly other types of cancers that develop EMT properties."

Here, we found that the expression of ET-1 and VEGF were correlated with tumor stage and were significantly higher than that in the normal cartilage. Exogenous ET-1 with chondrosarcoma cells promoted VEGF expression and subsequently increased migration and tube formation in endothelial progenitor cells. ET-1 increased VEGF expression and angiogenesis through ETAR, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), Akt and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling cascades. Knockdown of ET-1 decreased VEGF expression and also abolished chondrosarcoma conditional medium-mediated angiogenesis in vitro as well as angiogenesis effects in the chick chorioallantoic membrane and Matrigel plug nude mice model in vivo. In addition, in the xenograft tumor angiogenesis model, knockdown of ET-1 significantly reduced tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis. Taken together, these results indicate that ET-1 occurs through ETAR, ILK and Akt, which in turn activates HIF-1α, resulting in the activation of VEGF expression and contributing to the angiogenesis and tumor growth of human chondrosarcoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2016046687,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly implicated in regulating tumor malignance through their capacity to coordinately repress expression of tumor-related genes. Here, we show that overexpression of miR-194 in lung cancer cell lines, results in suppressing metastasis of lung cancer cells, while inhibiting its expression through ‘miRNA sponge’ promotes the cancer cells to metastasize. miR-194 expression is also found to be in strongly negative association with metastasis in clinical specimens of non-small cell lung cancer. We demonstrate that miR-194 directly targets both BMP1 and p27kip1. The resulting downregulation of BMP1 leads to suppression of TGFβ activity and, thus, to downregulation of the expression of key oncogenic genes (matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9). This leads, in turn, to decreased tumor invasion. In addition, the miRNA-194-induced suppression of p27kip1 activates the RhoA pathway, producing enhanced development of actin stress fibers and impaired migration of cancer cells. These findings reveal two structurally independent but functionally linked branches of the regulatory and signaling pathway that together provide a bridge between the metastasis-depressing miRNA and the key genes that govern the malignancy of lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2000324903,"Protein synthesis has a key role in the control of cell proliferation, and its deregulation is associated with pathological conditions, notably cancer. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), was known to inhibit protein synthesis. However, it does not substantially inhibit protein synthesis and cell proliferation in many cancer types. We were interested in finding a novel target in rapamycin-resistant cancer. The rate-limiting factor for translation is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is negatively regulated by eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Here, we provide evidence that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β promotes cell proliferation through positive regulation of protein synthesis. We found that GSK-3β phosphorylates and inactivates 4E-BP1, thereby increasing eIF4E-dependent protein synthesis. Considering the clinical relevance of pathways regulating protein synthesis, our study provides a promising new strategy and target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2029520352,"Cancer stem cell (CSC) biology and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are thought to be mechanistically linked and may be key components of cancer development and progression. However, stimuli that induce EMT and CSC-like features ('stemness') are poorly defined. We and others have shown that the inflammatory cytokine oncostatin-M (OSM) mediates phenotypic changes in breast cancer that are consistent with EMT and dedifferentiation, including enhanced migration and loss of hormone receptors. In this study, we have expanded on these prior observations to determine whether OSM is a cell-extrinsic driver of EMT and/or stemness. OSM stimulation of the luminal breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D induced EMT features including loss of membranous E-cadherin and induction of snail and slug expression. OSM treatment markedly enhanced the formation of mammospheres (up to 20-fold, P<0.001), which displayed high expression of the pluripotency factor SOX2. The proportion of cells with a CD44(high)CD24(-/low) phenotype was similarly increased by OSM (P<0.001). OSM-induced mammosphere formation and CD44(high)CD24(-/low) induction was dependent on PI3K signalling. In silico analysis of human breast tumours (from a publicly available data set, n=322) confirmed that co-expression of a PI3K transcriptional signature, but not MAPK or STAT3 signatures, was necessary to detect an association between OSMR and poor prognosis. Assessment of a second in silico data set (n=241 breast tumours) confirmed a significant relationship between OSMR, markers of EMT and CSCs, and chemotherapy resistance. Direct analysis of mRNA expression by RT-PCR in a third cohort (n=72 breast tumours) demonstrated that high expression of OSM is associated positively with indicators of EMT (SNAI1, P<0.001) and stemness (SOX2, P<0.05). Our data suggest for the first time that OSM may promote a clinically relevant EMT/CSC-like phenotype in human breast cancer via a PI3K-dependent mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1972333858,"P53 inactivation by p53 mutation and E6 oncoprotein has a crucial role in human carcinogenesis. DDX3 has been shown to be a target of p53. In this study, we hypothesized that DDX3 loss by p53 inactivation may promote tumor malignancy and poor patients’ outcome. Mechanically, DDX3 loss by p53 knockdown and E6 overexpression was observed in A549 lung cancer cells. Conversely, DDX3 expression was markedly elevated by wild-type (WT) p53 ectopic expression in p53-null H1299 cells, E6-knockdown TL-1 lung cancer and SiHa cervical cancer cells. Interestingly, DDX3 loss promotes soft-agar growth and invasive capability; however, both capabilities were suppressed by DDX3 overexpression. We next expected that DDX3 loss might result in Slug-suppressed E-cadherin expression via decreased MDM2-mediated Slug degradation. As expected, MDM2 transcription is suppressed by DDX3 loss via decreased SP1 binding activity to the MDM2 promoter. Consequently, Slug expression was elevated by the reduction of MDM2 because of DDX3 loss, and E-cadherin expression was suppressed by Slug. Consistent observations in the correlation of DDX3 loss with MDM2, Slug and E-cadherin were seen in lung tumors from lung cancer patients. In addition, patients with low-DDX3 tumors had poorer survival and relapse than patients with high-DDX3 tumors. In conclusion, we suggest that DDX3 loss by p53 inactivation via MDM2/Slug/E-cadherin pathway promotes tumor malignancy and poor patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1979982555,"PreQ1, a metabolic precursor of the modified tRNA nucleotide queuosine, regulates expression of queuosine biosynthetic genes via two distinct classes of preQ1 riboswitch. Biochemical studies and the first X-ray crystal structure of a class II preQ1 riboswitch reveal how preQ1 recognizes this RNA motif and how it may regulate translation of downstream genes. PreQ1 riboswitches regulate genes by binding the pyrrolopyrimidine intermediate preQ1 during the biosynthesis of the essential tRNA base queuosine. We report what is to our knowledge the first preQ1-II riboswitch structure at 2.3-Å resolution, which uses a previously uncharacterized fold to achieve effector recognition at the confluence of a three-way helical junction flanking a pseudoknotted ribosome-binding site. The results account for translational control mediated by the preQ1-II riboswitch class and expand the known repertoire of ligand-binding modes used by regulatory RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2018622616,"The ribosome is a complex molecular machine that, in order to synthesize proteins, has to decode mRNAs by pairing their codons with matching tRNAs. Decoding is a major determinant of fitness and requires accurate and fast selection of correct tRNAs among many similar competitors. However, it is unclear whether the modern ribosome, and in particular its large conformational changes during decoding, are the outcome of adaptation to its task as a decoder or the result of other constraints. Here, we derive the energy landscape that provides optimal discrimination between competing substrates and thereby optimal tRNA decoding. We show that the measured landscape of the prokaryotic ribosome is sculpted in this way. This model suggests that conformational changes of the ribosome and tRNA during decoding are means to obtain an optimal decoder. Our analysis puts forward a generic mechanism that may be utilized broadly by molecular recognition systems."
https://openalex.org/W2115261275,"Many brain circuits control behavior by integrating information arising from separate inputs onto a common target neuron. Neurons in the ventral striatum (VS) receive converging excitatory afferents from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HP), and thalamus, among other structures, and the integration of these inputs is critical for goal-directed behaviors. Although HP inputs have been described as gating PFC throughput in the VS, recent data reveal that the VS desynchronizes from the HP during epochs of burst-like PFC activity related to decision making. It is therefore possible that PFC inputs locally attenuate responses to other glutamatergic inputs to the VS. Here, we found that delivering trains of stimuli to the PFC suppresses HP- and thalamus-evoked synaptic responses in the VS, in part through activation of inhibitory processes. This interaction may enable the PFC to exert influence on basal ganglia loops during decision-making instances with minimal disturbance from ongoing contextual inputs."

https://openalex.org/W1999908375,"The neuropeptide PDF is crucial for Drosophila circadian behavior: it keeps circadian neurons synchronized. Here, we identify GW182 as a key regulator of PDF signaling. Indeed, GW182 downregulation results in phenotypes similar to those of Pdf and Pdf-receptor (Pdfr) mutants. gw182 genetically interacts with Pdfr and cAMP signaling, which is essential for PDFR function. GW182 mediates miRNA-dependent gene silencing through its interaction with AGO1. Consistently, GW182’s AGO1 interaction domain is required for GW182's circadian function. Moreover, our results indicate that GW182 modulates PDFR signaling by silencing the expression of the cAMP phosphodiesterase DUNCE. Importantly, this repression is under photic control, and GW182 activity level—which is limiting in circadian neurons—influences the responses of the circadian neural network to light. We propose that GW182’s gene silencing activity functions as a rheostat for PDFR signaling and thus profoundly impacts the circadian neural network and its response to environmental inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2006382865,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are a promising class of anticancer epigenetic drugs, however, molecular factors influencing the responses of individual tumors to HDACi therapies remain obscure. Here, we sought to identify genes associated with HDACi resistance in gastric cancer. Treating a panel of 17 gastric cancer cell lines with multiple HDACi compounds (trichostatin A, SAHA and MS275), we identified two distinct classes of lines exhibiting either HDACi sensitivity or resistance. Genomic comparisons between the sensitive and resistant classes using two independent microarray platforms identified RNH1, encoding a ribonuclease inhibitor, as a gene highly expressed in HDACi-resistant lines. Using genetic knockdown and overexpression assays, we show that RNH1 is both necessary and sufficient to induce HDACi resistance, and that RNH1 is likely to mediate this resistance through the dampening of HDACi-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells. The discovery of RNH1 as a regulator of HDACi resistance in gastric cancer highlights a functional role for ROS induction in the cellular effects of this important drug class."
https://openalex.org/W2021628043,"LKB1/STK11 is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an inherited cancer disorder associated with genome instability. The LKB1 protein functions in the regulation of cell proliferation, polarization and differentiation. Here, we suggest a role of LKB1 in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. LKB1 localized to DNA ends upon the generation of micro-irradiation and I-SceI endonuclease-induced DSBs. LKB1 inactivation either by RNA interference or by kinase-dead mutation compromised NHEJ-mediated DNA repair by suppressing the accumulation of BRM, a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, at DSB sites, which promotes the recruitment of an essential NHEJ factor, KU70. AMPK2, a major substrate of LKB1 and a histone H2B kinase, was recruited to DSBs in an LKB1-dependent manner. AMPK2 depletion and a mutation of H2B that disrupted the AMPK2 phoshorylation site impaired KU70 and BRM recruitment to DSB sites. LKB1 depletion induced the formation of chromosome breaks and radials. These results suggest that LKB1-AMPK signaling controls NHEJ and contributes to genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2045037360,"The orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 regulates diverse cellular activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have a dual role in controlling the function of Nur77. While JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Nur77 positively regulates its translocation to the mitochondria to induce apoptosis, it negatively regulates the stability of Nur77. The underlying mechanism for the dual role of JNK in regulating Nur77, however, is unclear. Here, we report that E3 ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) prevents Nur77 degradation through mediating its unconventional ubiquitination, thereby mitigating the JNK-mediated downregulating effect, which leads to Nur77 accumulation and subsequent translocation to mitochondria to trigger apoptosis. In this process, protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Smurf1 at Thr306 is a prerequisite step. Accordingly, cyclic AMP/PKA signaling switches the fate of Nur77 from degradation to triggering apoptosis in chemotherapy drug cisplatin-treated cells. Hence, our study revealed a novel mechanism, by which PKA/Smurf1 antagonizes the downregulating effect of JNK on Nur77, leading to the accumulation of Nur77 for apoptosis induction triggered by cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W1984704180,"Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) contain KIT or PDGFRA kinase gain-of-function mutations, and therefore respond clinically to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. However, clinical progression subsequently results from selection of TKI-resistant clones, typically containing secondary mutations in the KIT kinase domain, which can be heterogeneous between and within GIST metastases in a given patient. TKI-resistant KIT oncoproteins require HSP90 chaperoning and are potently inactivated by HSP90 inhibitors, but clinical applications in GIST patients are constrained by the toxicity resulting from concomitant inactivation of various other HSP90 client proteins, beyond KIT and PDGFRA. To identify novel targets responsible for KIT oncoprotein function, we performed parallel genome-scale short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene knockdowns in KIT-mutant GIST-T1 and GIST882. GIST cells were infected with a lentiviral shRNA pooled library targeting 11 194 human genes, and allowed to proliferate for 5-7 weeks, at which point assessment of relative hairpin abundance identified the HSP90 cofactor, CDC37, as one of the top six GIST-specific essential genes. Validations in treatment-naive (GIST-T1, GIST882) vs imatinib-resistant GISTs (GIST48, GIST430) demonstrated that: (1) CDC37 interacts with oncogenic KIT; (2) CDC37 regulates expression and activation of KIT and downstream signaling intermediates in GIST; and (3) unlike direct HSP90 inhibition, CDC37 knockdown accomplishes prolonged KIT inhibition (>20 days) in GIST. These studies highlight CDC37 as a key biologic vulnerability in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST. CDC37 targeting is expected to be selective for KIT/PDGFRA and a subset of other HSP90 clients, and thereby represents a promising strategy for inactivating the myriad KIT/PDGFRA oncoproteins in TKI-resistant GIST patients."
https://openalex.org/W2079451809,"Presynaptic inhibition onto axons regulates neuronal output, but how such inhibitory synapses develop and are maintained in vivo remains unclear. Axon terminals of glutamatergic retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs) receive GABAA and GABAC receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition. We found that perturbing GABAergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission does not prevent GABAergic synaptogenesis onto RBC axons. But, GABA release is necessary for maintaining axonal GABA receptors. This activity-dependent process is receptor subtype specific: GABAC receptors are maintained, whereas GABAA receptors containing α1, but not α3, subunits decrease over time in mice with deficient GABA synthesis. GABAA receptor distribution on RBC axons is unaffected in GABAC receptor knockout mice. Thus, GABAA and GABAC receptor maintenance are regulated separately. Although immature RBCs elevate their glutamate release when GABA synthesis is impaired, homeostatic mechanisms ensure that the RBC output operates within its normal range after eye opening, perhaps to regain proper visual processing within the scotopic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1966810365,"Mechanical factors such as strain, pressure, and shear stress are key regulators of cell function, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the detection and responses to such stimuli are poorly understood. Whether the angiotensin II (AngII) AT1 receptor (AT1R) transduces shear stress in endothelial cells (ECs) is unknown. We exposed human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) to a shear stress of 0 (control) or 15 dyn/cm2 for 5 or 10 min. The colocalization of AT1R with caveolin-1 (Cav1), endosomal markers Rab5, EEA1, and Rab7, and lysosomal marker Lamp-1 increased in shear stimulated cells, detected by immunocytochemistry. Shear stress reduced labeling of wild-type mouse ECs (18±3% of unsheared control, P<0.01) but not Cav1-/- ECs (90±10%) with fluorescent AngII, confirming that internalization of AT1R requires Cav1. Shear stress activated ERK1/2 2-fold (P<0.01), which was prevented by the AT1R blocker losartan. NADPH oxidase inhibition with apocynin prevented both the colocalization of AT1R with Cav1 and the induction of ERK1/2 by shear stress. Moreover, shear-dependent ERK1/2 activation was minimal in CHO cells expressing an AT1Ra mutant that does not internalize, compared with cells expressing wild-type AT1Ra (P<0.05). Hence, AT1R may be an important transducer of shear stress-dependent activation of ERK1/2.—Ramkhelawon, B., Rivas, D., Lehoux, S., Shear stress activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor.
