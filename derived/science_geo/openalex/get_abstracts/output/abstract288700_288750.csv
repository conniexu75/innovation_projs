With three different subcultures from joint fluid, iritis has been induced in rabbits; and following intranasal inoculation with the same cultures there has developed in mice a pneumonia similar to that found in mice inoculated with rheumatic exudates and with suspensions of chorioallantoic membranes infected with rheumatic exudates. Therefore it seems probable that in all instances the pathogenic agent was derived from similar sources, viz., patients with rheumatic fever. Further work will be required to demonstrate the etiologic significance of these pathogenic agents in rheumatic fever."

https://openalex.org/W89879940,"Congress must decide in the coming weeks whether it should try to revive the civil nuclear waste program or yield to politics and apply an anesthetic for a couple of years. The program is in such poor shape that Congress may have to do something. Thirty proposals have been introduced; most would derail or postpone the present plan for disposing of nuclear waste. About 50 members of Congress would like to call a moratorium on field research at potential waste repository sites. They see this as the best way out of the present impasse-if a moratorium is a way out. But this decision would come as a blow to the nuclear utilities, already hard-pressed on several fronts. The last thing they want is a general review of the waste program. The options available for dispersing of nuclear wastes are discussed."

Belfort (10 July, p.182), two sentences were incorrectly printed. On page 182, the sentence beginning at the bottom of the second column should have read, ""The td intron is indeed homologous throughout the T-even phages, as demonstrated by hybridization and dideoxy primer-extension analysis of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and splice site products (11)."" On page 183, in the legend to figure 2, the next-to-last sentence should have read, ""Oligonucleotide probes (1 to 4) indicated by arrows are as described (21)."""
