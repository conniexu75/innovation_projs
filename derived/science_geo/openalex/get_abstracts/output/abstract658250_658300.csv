https://openalex.org/W3053604026,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) links innate immunity to biological processes ranging from antitumor immunity to microbiome homeostasis. Mechanistic understanding of the anticancer potential for STING receptor activation is currently limited by metabolic instability of the natural cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) ligands. From a pathway-targeted cell-based screen, we identified a non-nucleotide, small-molecule STING agonist, termed SR-717, that demonstrates broad interspecies and interallelic specificity. A 1.8-angstrom cocrystal structure revealed that SR-717 functions as a direct cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) mimetic that induces the same “closed” conformation of STING. SR-717 displayed antitumor activity; promoted the activation of CD8+ T, natural killer, and dendritic cells in relevant tissues; and facilitated antigen cross-priming. SR-717 also induced the expression of clinically relevant targets, including programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), in a STING-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3058279579,"Electronic dynamics in liquids are of fundamental importance, but time-resolved experiments have so far remained limited to the femtosecond time scale. We report the extension of attosecond spectroscopy to the liquid phase. We measured time delays of 50 to 70 attoseconds between the photoemission from liquid water and that from gaseous water at photon energies of 21.7 to 31.0 electron volts. These photoemission delays can be decomposed into a photoionization delay sensitive to the local environment and a delay originating from electron transport. In our experiments, the latter contribution is shown to be negligible. By referencing liquid water to gaseous water, we isolated the effect of solvation on the attosecond photoionization dynamics of water molecules. Our methods define an approach to separating bound and unbound electron dynamics from the structural response of the solvent."
https://openalex.org/W3078705653,"Abrupt climate changes during the last glacial period have been detected in a global array of palaeoclimate records, but our understanding of their absolute timing and regional synchrony is incomplete. Our compilation of 63 published, independently dated speleothem records shows that abrupt warmings in Greenland were associated with synchronous climate changes across the Asian Monsoon, South American Monsoon, and European-Mediterranean regions that occurred within decades. Together with the demonstration of bipolar synchrony in atmospheric response, this provides independent evidence of synchronous high-latitude-to-tropical coupling of climate changes during these abrupt warmings. Our results provide a globally coherent framework with which to validate model simulations of abrupt climate change and to constrain ice-core chronologies."

https://openalex.org/W3081495325,"Pulse-like carbon dioxide release to the atmosphere on centennial time scales has only been identified for the most recent glacial and deglacial periods and is thought to be absent during warmer climate conditions. Here, we present a high-resolution carbon dioxide record from 330,000 to 450,000 years before present, revealing pronounced carbon dioxide jumps (CDJ) under cold and warm climate conditions. CDJ come in two varieties that we attribute to invigoration or weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and associated northward and southward shifts of the intertropical convergence zone, respectively. We find that CDJ are pervasive features of the carbon cycle that can occur during interglacial climate conditions if land ice masses are sufficiently extended to be able to disturb the AMOC by freshwater input."
https://openalex.org/W3074057893,"Germinal center (GC) responses potentiate the generation of follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells. However, the molecular cues driving TFR cell formation remain unknown. Here, we show that sclerostin domain-containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1), secreted by a subpopulation of follicular helper T (TFH) cells and T–B cell border–enriched fibroblastic reticular cells, is developmentally required for TFR cell generation. Fate tracking and transcriptome assessment in reporter mice establishes SOSTDC1-expressing TFH cells as a distinct T cell population that develops after SOSTDC1– TFH cells and loses the ability to help B cells for antibody production. Notably, Sostdc1 ablation in TFH cells results in substantially reduced TFR cell numbers and consequently elevated GC responses. Mechanistically, SOSTDC1 blocks the WNT–β-catenin axis and facilitates TFR cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3080104603,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly widespread with an overall global estimated prevalence of 25%. Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a key contributor to NAFLD progression and predicts moderate-severe liver fibrosis and mortality. However, there is currently no uniform consensus on routine NAFLD screening among T2DM patients, and the risk factors of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis among T2DM patients remain to be clarified fully. Aim We explored the prevalence, clinical spectrum, and risk factors of NAFLD and liver fibrosis among T2DM patients. Methods This is a cross-sectional study that enrolled subjects from a primary care clinic and a diabetes centre in Singapore. Subjects aged 21 to 70 years of all ethnic groups with an established T2DM diagnosis were included. Subjects with chronic liver diseases of other aetiologies were excluded. All subjects underwent transient elastography for hepatic steatosis and fibrosis assessment. Their demographics, anthropometric measurements and clinical parameters were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA/SE16.0 software. Results Among 449 enrolled T2DM subjects, 436 with complete data and valid transient elastography results were analysed. Overall, 78.72% (344/436) of the T2DM subjects had NAFLD, of which 13.08% (45/344) had increased liver stiffness. Higher ALT level (OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.14; p = 0.004), obesity (BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2, OR = 2.64; 95% CI: 1.28–5.44; p = 0.008) and metabolic syndrome (OR = 4.36; 95% CI 1.40–13.58; p = 0.011) were independent factors associated with increased CAP (NAFLD). Higher AST level (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02–1.11; p = 0.008), CAP value (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00–1.03; p = 0.003), lower platelet count (OR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98–1.00; p = 0.009) and concomitant hypertension (OR = 4.56; 95% CI: 1.18–17.62; p = 0.028) were independent factors associated with increased liver stiffness. Conclusions Our study demonstrated a considerably high prevalence of NAFLD among T2DM patients, with the proportion of advanced liver fibrosis among T2DM NAFLD patients much higher than the general population. Given that NAFLD is largely asymptomatic, increased awareness and vigilance for identifying NAFLD and increased liver stiffness among T2DM patients should be advocated."
https://openalex.org/W3080878823,"Illegal hunting is a persistent problem in many protected areas, but an overview of the extent of this problem and its impact on wildlife is lacking. We reviewed 40 years (1980–2020) of global research to examine the spatial distribution of research and socio-ecological factors influencing population decline within protected areas under illegal hunting pressure. From 81 papers reporting 988 species/site combinations, 294 mammal species were reported to have been illegally hunted from 155 protected areas across 48 countries. Research in illegal hunting has increased substantially during the review period and showed biases towards strictly protected areas and the African continent. Population declines were most frequent in countries with a low human development index, particularly in strict protected areas and for species with a body mass over 100 kg. Our results provide evidence that illegal hunting is most likely to cause declines of large-bodied species in protected areas of resource-poor countries regardless of protected area conservation status. Given the growing pressures of illegal hunting, increased investments in people’s development and additional conservation efforts such as improving anti-poaching strategies and conservation resources in terms of improving funding and personnel directed at this problem are a growing priority."
https://openalex.org/W3080656438,"China's rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to poor air quality, and air pollution has caused great concern among the Chinese public. Most analyses of air pollution trends in China are based on model simulations or satellite data. Studies using field observation data and focusing on the latest data from environmental monitoring stations covering the whole country to assess the latest trends of different pollutants in different regions are relatively rare. The State Council of China promulgated the toughest-ever Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (Action Plan) in 2013. This led to a major improvement in air quality. We use the hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) and mass concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, and SO2 in 362 cities from 2015 to 2019, obtained from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, to study their temporal and spatial changes and assess the effectiveness of the policy on the atmospheric environment since its promulgation and implementation. We found that the national and regional air quality in China continues to improve, with PM2.5, PM10, AQI, CO, and SO2 exhibiting negative trends. However, O3 and NO2 pollution is an urgent problem that needs to be solved and the current control strategy for PM2.5 will only partially reduce the PM2.5 pollution in the western region. Although the implementation of ""Action Plan"" measures has effectively improved air quality, China's air pollution is still serious and far from the WHO standard. Implementing measures for continuous and effective emissions control is still a top priority."
https://openalex.org/W3052573235,"Abstract Androgen receptor (AR), is a transcription factor and a member of a hormone receptor superfamily. AR plays a vital role in the progression of prostate cancer and is a crucial target for therapeutic interventions. While the majority of advanced-stage prostate cancer patients will initially respond to the androgen deprivation, the disease often progresses to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Interestingly, CRPC tumors continue to depend on hyperactive AR signaling and will respond to potent second-line antiandrogen therapies, including bicalutamide (CASODEX ® ) and enzalutamide (XTANDI ® ). However, the progression-free survival rate for the CRPC patients on antiandrogen therapies is only 8–19 months. Hence, there is a need to understand the mechanisms underlying CRPC progression and eventual treatment resistance. Here, we have leveraged next-generation sequencing and newly developed analytical methodologies to evaluate the role of AR signaling in regulating the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells. The genomic and pharmacologic stimulation and inhibition of AR activity demonstrates that AR regulates alternative splicing within cancer-relevant genes. Furthermore, by integrating transcriptomic data from in vitro experiments and in prostate cancer patients, we found that a significant number of AR-regulated splicing events are associated with tumor progression. For example, we found evidence for an inadvertent AR-antagonist-mediated switch in IDH1 and PL2G2A isoform expression, which is associated with a decrease in overall survival of patients. Mechanistically, we discovered that the epithelial-specific splicing regulators (ESRP1 and ESRP2), flank many AR-regulated alternatively spliced exons. And, using 2D invasion assays, we show that the inhibition of ESRPs can suppress AR-antagonist-driven tumor invasion. Our work provides evidence for a new mechanism by which AR alters the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells by modulating alternative splicing. As such, our work has important implications for CRPC progression and development of resistance to treatment with bicalutamide and enzalutamide."
https://openalex.org/W3057775383,"Abstract Glioma reported to be refractory to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor is the most common malignant tumor in central nervous system. Our research showed the low expression of miR-450a-5p and high expression of EGFR in glioma tissues. MiR-450a-5p was also observed to synergize with gefitinib to inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion and induce the apoptosis and autophagy of glioma cells. Furthermore, miR-450a-5p was demonstrated to target 3′UTR of EGFR, and regulated EGFR-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, the above effects induced by miR-450a-5p in glioma cells were reversed by WIPI1 silencing. The inhibition role of miR-450a-5p on glioma growth was also confirmed in vivo by subcutaneous and intracranial tumor xenografts. Therefore, we conclude that miR-450a-5p synergizes with gefitinib to inhibit the glioma tumorigenesis through inducing autophagy by regulating the EGFR-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby enhancing the drug sensitivity of gefitinib."
https://openalex.org/W3080312331,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impaired social cognition and communication. In addition to social impairment, individuals with ASD often have intellectual disability. Intelligence is known to influence the phenotypic presentation of ASD. Nevertheless, the relation between intelligence and social reciprocity in people with ASD remains unclear, especially in childhood. To elucidate this relation, we analyzed 56 typically developing children (35 male, 21 female, aged 60-91 months) and 46 children with ASD (35 male, 11 female, aged 60-98 months) from university and affiliated hospitals. Their cognitive function was evaluated using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. Their social cognition was assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale. We used linear regression models to ascertain whether the associations between intelligence and social cognition of typically developing children and children with ASD are significantly different. Among the children with ASD, scores on the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children correlated significantly with social cognition, indicating that higher intelligence is associated with better social cognition. For typically developing children, however, no significant correlation was found. One explanation might be that children with ASD fully use general intelligence for successful learning in social cognition, although extensive use of intelligence might not be necessary for TD children. Alternatively, autistic impairment in social cognition can be compensated by intelligence despite a persistent deficit in social cognition. In either case, when using the SRS as a quantitative phenotype measure for ASD, the influence of intelligence must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3080480643,"Background Diabetes often coexists with other medical conditions and is a contributing cause of death in 88% of people who have it. The study aimed at evaluating medication adherence, self-care behaviours and diabetes knowledge among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Ghana. Methods A total of 330 participants were recruited into the study from three public hospitals in the Tamale metropolis. A validated medication adherence questionnaire and the Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities tool were used to assess medication adherence and self-care activities respectively. Logistic and linear regressions were used to determine factors positively associated with non-adherence to medication and self-care behaviours respectively. Results Of the 330 participants whose data were analysed, the mean (SD) age was 57.5 (11.8) years. The majority (84.5%) were adherent to anti-diabetes medication. Participant’s age, educational level, and practice of self-care behaviours influenced adherence to anti-diabetes medication. Participants aged 70 years and above were 79% less likely to be non-adherent to medication as compared to those below 50 years [OR = 0.21 (95%CI: 0.06–0.74), p = 0.016]. Participants with senior high school education were 3.7 times more likely to be non-adherent to medication than those with tertiary education [OR = 3.68 (95%CI: 1.01–13.44), p = 0.049]. Participants with tertiary education had an increase in the level of practice of self-management by 1.14 (p = 0.041). A unit increase in knowledge score also increased the level of practice of self-management by 3.02 (p<0.001). Conclusion The majority of participants were adherent to anti-diabetes medication. Non-adherence to medication was associated with younger age and low level of education. Interventions to improve adherence should target younger and newly diagnosed patients through aggressive counselling to address healthy self-management behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3080263026,"Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) are a public health concern in Ethiopia. However, the relationship between menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) factors to RTIs have not been well addressed. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2019 among 602 systematically selected reproductive-age women aged 15–49 years in Dessie City. Data were collected using a questionnaire and a direct observation checklist. RTIs were identified by the presence during one year before data collection of one or more signs of vaginal discharge, itching/irritation or ulcers/lesions around the vulva, pain during urination and sexual intercourse, and lower abdominal pain and lower back pain. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95%CI (confidence interval). The self-reported prevalence of RTIs was 11.0%(95%CI:8.5–13.7%) during one year prior to the survey. The most commonly reported symptoms of RTI were burning micturition (9.1%) and vaginal discharge (6.1%). Three-fourths 443(75.0%) of households used traditional pit latrines and the majority of the study participants 527(89.2%) did not meet the basic access requirement of 20 liters of water per capita per day. The majority 562(95.1%) of the study participants did not have multiple sexual partners during the last year and 97.8% did not practiced sexual intercourse during menstruation. The most common type of blood-absorbent material used was a sanitary pad 497(84.8%) followed by cloth 89(15.2%). Factors significantly associated with RTIs were using unclean latrines (AOR: 4.20; 95%CI:2.00–8.80), not washing hands with soap before touching the genital area (AOR: 3.94; 95%CI:1.49–10.45), history of symptoms of RTIs in the past year (AOR: 5.88; 95%CI:2.30–14.98), having multiple sexual partners in the past year (AOR: 4.46; 95%CI:1.59–12.53), changing absorbent material only once per day (AOR: 8.99; 95%CI:4.51–17.92), and washing the genital area only once per day during menstruation (AOR: 5.76; 95%CI:2.07–16.05). The self-reported prevalence of RTI showed that one women experienced RTI among ten reproductive-age women. Designing a women’s health policy that focuses on ensuring availability of WASH facilities and improving MHM at the community level is key for sustainably preventing RTIs."
https://openalex.org/W3080535073,"The research was conducted in the “logical series” of seven ligands: chromone, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, 3,7-dihydroxyflavone, galangin, kaempferol and quercetin. Each subsequent ligand differs from the previous one, among others by an additional hydroxyl group. The studied chromone derivatives are plant secondary metabolites which play an important role in growth, reproduction, and resistance to pathogens. They are important food ingredients with valuable pro-health properties. The studies of the relationships between their molecular structure and biological activity facilitate searching for new chemical compounds with important biological properties not by trial and error, but concerning the impact of specific changes in their structure on the compound properties. Therefore several pectroscopic methods (FT-IR, FT-Raman, 1H and 13C NMR) were applied to study the molecular structure of the compounds in the series. Moreover the quantum-chemical calculations at B3LYP/6-311++G** were performed to obtained the theoretical NMR spectra, NBO atomic charge, global reactivity descriptors and thermodynamic parameters. The antioxidant activity of the compounds was tested in the DPPH and FRAP assays and the mechanism of antioxidant activity was discussed based on the results on theoretical calculations. The cytotoxicity of the ligands toward human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco2 cells was estimated and correlated with the lipophilicity of the compounds. The principal component analyses (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to study the dependency between the molecular structure of ligands and their biological activity. The experimental data were related to the theoretical ones. The found regular changes in physicochemical properties correlated well with the systematic changes in antioxidant and biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W3081131580,"Although the suicide rate in China has decreased over the past 20 years, there have been reports that the younger age group has been experiencing an increased incidence of completed suicide. Given that undergraduate groups are at higher risks of suicidality, it is important to monitor and screen for risk factors for suicidal ideation and behaviors to ensure their well-being.To examine the risk and protective factors contributing to suicidality among undergraduate college students in seven provinces in China.We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 13,387 college students from seven universities in Ningxia, Shandong, Shanghai, Jilin, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires.Higher scores in the psychological strain, depression, anxiety, stress, and psychache (psychological risk factors for suicidality) and lower scores in self-esteem and purpose in life (psychological protective factors against suicidality) were associated with increased suicidality among undergraduate students in China. Demographic factors which were associated with higher risks of suicidality were female gender, younger age, bad academic results, were an only child, non-participation in school associations, and had an urban household registration. Perceived good health was protective against suicidality.Knowing the common risk and protective factors for suicidality among Chinese undergraduate students is useful in developing interventions targeted at this population and to guide public health policies on suicide in China."
https://openalex.org/W3080829324,"According to present guidelines, active exercise is one key component in the comprehensive treatment of nonspecific chronic back pain (NSCBP). Whole body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) is a safe, and time-effective training method, that may be effective in NSCBP-patients.In this prospective and controlled nonrandomized clinical study, two therapeutic approaches were compared. One group received 20 minutes WB-EMS per week. An active control group (ACG) received a multimodal therapy program. A third group included subjects without back pain. To all groups, the following measurement instruments were applied: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), North American Spine Society Instrument (NASS); SF 36 survey and measurements for muscular function and postural stability. In the EMS-group: T0: baseline; T1: at 6 weeks; T2: at 12 weeks and T3: at 24 weeks. In the ACG: T0 baseline and T1 after 4 weeks.In the intervention group, 128 patients with low back pain were enrolled, 85 in the WB-EMS group and 43 in the ACG. 34 subjects were allocated to the passive control group. The average age was 58.6 years (18-86 years). In the EMS group, the NRS (1-10) improved statistically and clinically significantly by 2 points. The ODI was reduced by 19.7 points. The NASS and most of the SF 36 items improved significantly. In the multimodal treatment group, only the muscular function improved slightly.Our data support the hypothesis that WB-EMS is at least as effective as a multimodal treatment, which is often referred to as being the golden standard. Therefore WB-EMS may be an effective and, with 20 min./week training time, very time-efficient alternative to established multimodal treatment models."
https://openalex.org/W3081107298,"Models designed to detect abnormalities that reflect disease from facial structures are an emerging area of research for automated facial analysis, which has important potential value in smart healthcare applications. However, most of the proposed models directly analyze the whole face image containing the background information, and rarely consider the effects of the background and different face regions on the analysis results. Therefore, in view of these effects, we propose an end-to-end attention network with spatial transformation to estimate different pain intensities. In the proposed method, the face image is first provided as input to a spatial transformation network for solving the problem of background interference; then, the attention mechanism is used to adaptively adjust the weights of different face regions of the transformed face image; finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) containing a Softmax function is utilized to classify the pain levels. The extensive experiments and analysis are conducted on the benchmarking and publicly available database, namely the UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain. More specifically, in order to verify the superiority of our proposed method, the comparisons with the basic CNNs and the-state-of-the-arts are performed, respectively. The experiments show that the introduced spatial transformation and attention mechanism in our method can significantly improve the estimation performances and outperform the-state-of-the-arts."
https://openalex.org/W3080502379,"The present study aims to develop and validate an Italian version of the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS). A large sample of Italian-speaking participants (N = 1139) completed the BSCS and measures of personality and individual dispositions. A clinical sample (N = 217) was administered the Italian version and an English-speaking sample (N = 274) completed the original version to test measurement invariance. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the best fit was observed for a shortened two-factor model (i.e., impulse control and self-discipline). Metric invariance across languages and partial strong invariance across genders, ages, and clinical status were demonstrated. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability for the total scale were adequate, and validity was established based on its correlations with related constructs and confirming that males and young individuals are more likely to have lower self-control. Results support the use of the shortened BSCS version to assess self-control in Italian-speaking individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3080731340,"This study aimed to test whether or not where people come from and move to impacts their method for dealing with stress. We investigated this research question among newcomers crossing between the rice and wheat farming regions in China—south and north China, respectively. New evidence suggests wheat-farming agriculture fosters a coping strategy of changing the environment (primary coping), while rice-farming regions foster the converse strategy of fitting into the environment (secondary coping). Using two longitudinal studies on newcomers at universities located in both the rice and wheat farming regions, we hypothesized that students from south China (rice region) at a university in north China (wheat region) would use more primary coping and it would lead to better adaptation (Study 1). In contrast, students from wheat-farming regions moving to a rice university would benefit from secondary coping as an effective strategy for buffering stress (Study 2). Results indicated that for students from rice-farming regions who were studying universities in wheat-farming regions, secondary coping was damaging and attenuated the stress-adaptation relationship. However, in study 2, the reverse was found, as secondary coping was found to buffer the negative effects of stress on sociocultural adaptation for students from wheat-farming regions who were studying at universities in rice-farming regions. This study lends further support to the theory that ecological factors impact how individuals cope with the acculturative stress of moving to a new environment."

It was shown that BBH has the genotoxic effect causing bacterial SOS response however no alkylating effect has been revealed. In addition to DNA damage, there is an oxidative effect causing the response of OxyR/S and SoxR/S regulons. The most sensitive to BBH lux-biosensor was E. coli pSoxS-lux which reacts to the appearance of superoxide anion radicals in the cell. It is assumed that the oxidation of BBH leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which provide the main contribution to the genotoxicity of this substance."
https://openalex.org/W3081303307,"Before fertilization, sperm bind to epithelial cells of the oviduct isthmus to form a reservoir that regulates sperm viability and capacitation. The sperm reservoir maintains optimum fertility in species, like swine, in which semen deposition and ovulation may not be well synchronized. We demonstrated previously that porcine sperm bind to two oviductal glycan motifs, a biantennary 6-sialylated N-acetyllactosamine (bi-SiaLN) oligosaccharide and 3-O-sulfated Lewis X trisaccharide (suLeX). Here, we assessed the ability of these glycans to regulate sperm Ca2+ influx, capacitation and affect sperm lifespan. After 24 h, the viability of sperm bound to immobilized bi-SiaLN and suLeX was higher (46% and 41% respectively) compared to viability of free-swimming sperm (10–12%). Ca2+ is a central regulator of sperm function so we assessed whether oviduct glycans could affect the Ca2+ influx that occurs during capacitation. Using a fluorescent intracellular Ca2+ probe, we observed that both oviduct glycans suppressed the Ca2+ increase that occurs during capacitation. Thus, specific oviduct glycans can regulate intracellular Ca2+. Because the increase in intracellular Ca2+ was suppressed by oviduct glycans, we examined whether glycans affected capacitation, as determined by protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the ability to undergo a Ca2+ ionophore-induced acrosome reaction. We found no discernable suppression of capacitation in sperm bound to oviduct glycans. We also detected no effect of oviduct glycans on sperm motility during capacitation. In summary, LeX and bi-SiaLN glycan motifs found on oviduct oligosaccharides suppress the Ca2+ influx that occurs during capacitation and extend sperm lifespan but do not affect sperm capacitation or motility."
https://openalex.org/W3080800513,"The dehydroshikimate dehydratase (DSD) from Corynebacterium glutamicum encoded by the qsuB gene is related to the previously described QuiC1 protein (39.9% identity) from Pseudomonas putida. Both QuiC1 and QsuB are two-domain bacterial DSDs. The N-terminal domain provides dehydratase activity, while the C-terminal domain has sequence identity with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. Here, the QsuB protein and its N-terminal domain (N-QsuB) were expressed in the T7 system, purified and characterized. QsuB was present mainly in octameric form (60%), while N-QsuB had a predominantly monomeric structure (80%) in aqueous buffer. Both proteins possessed DSD activity with one of the following cofactors (listed in the order of decreasing activity): Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+. The Km and kcat values for the QsuB enzyme (Km ~ 1 mM, kcat ~ 61 s-1) were two and three times higher than those for N-QsuB. 3,4-DHBA inhibited QsuB (Ki ~ 0.38 mM, Ki’ ~ 0.96 mM) and N-QsuB (Ki ~ 0.69 mM) enzymes via mixed and noncompetitive inhibition mechanism, respectively. E. coli MG1655ΔaroEPlac‒qsuB strain produced three times more 3,4-DHBA from glucose in test tube fermentation than the MG1655ΔaroEPlac‒n-qsuB strain. The C-terminal domain activity towards 3,4-DHBA was not established in vitro. This domain was proposed to promote protein oligomerization for maintaining structural stability of the enzyme. The dimer formation of QsuB protein was more predictable (ΔG = ‒15.8 kcal/mol) than the dimerization of its truncated version N-QsuB (ΔG = ‒0.4 kcal/mol)."
https://openalex.org/W3080146845,"Patient portals are creating new opportunities for youth to disclose high-fidelity sexually transmitted infection (STI) laboratory test result histories to sex partners. Among an online survey sample, we describe latent constructs and other variables associated with perceived behavioral intentions to disclose STI test history using patient portals. Participants were co-ed students aged 18 to 25 years (N = 354) attending a southern United States Historically Black College and University in 2015. Three reliable latent constructs were identified by conducting psychometric analyses on 27 survey items. Latent constructs represent, a) STI test disclosure valuation beliefs, b) communication practices, and c) performance expectancy beliefs for disclosing with patient portals. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship of latent constructs to perceived behavioral intentions to disclose STI test history using patient portals. Approximately 14% (48/354) reported patient portal use prior to study and 59% (208/354) endorsed behavioral intentions to use patient portals to disclose STI test history. The latent construct reflecting performance expectancies of patient portals to improve communication and accuracy of disclosed test information was associated with behavioral intentions to disclose STI test histories using patient portals [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.22; p<0.001]. Latent constructs representing communication valuation beliefs and practices were not associated with intentions. Self-reporting prior STI diagnosis was also associated with intentions to disclose using patient portals (AOR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.15 to 6.96; p = 0.02). Point of care messages focused on improvements to validating test results, communication, and empowerment, may be an effective strategy to support the adoption of patient portals for STI prevention among populations of college-aged Black youth."
https://openalex.org/W3080680234,"Introduction Afghanistan is affected by one of the world’s longest protracted armed conflicts, frequent natural disasters, disease outbreaks and large population movements and it suffers from a high burden of tuberculosis (TB), including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB). The study shows Médecins Sans Frontières’ experiences with care for patients with RR-TB in Kandahar Province. We describe the uptake of RR-TB treatment, how World Health Organisation criteria for the choice between the short and an individualized regimen were implemented, and treatment outcomes. Methods This is a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected data from RR-TB patients enrolled in care from 2016 until 2019. Descriptive analysis was performed to present characteristics of patients and treatment outcomes. Multivariable Cox analysis was performed to identify risk factors for having an unfavourable treatment outcome. Results Out of 146 enrolled RR-TB patients, 112 (76.7%) started treatment: 41 (36.6%) and 71 (63.4%) with the short and individualized treatment regimen, respectively. Of 82 with results for fluoroquinolone susceptibility, 39 (47.6%) had fluoroquinolone-resistant TB. Seven patients with initially fluoroquinolone-resistant TB and three pregnant women started the short regimen and 18 patients eligible for the short regimen started the injectable-free individualized regimen. Overall, six-month smear and culture conversion were 98.7% and 97.1%, respectively; treatment success was 70.1%. Known initial fluoroquinolone resistance (aHR 3.77, 95%CI:1.53–9.27) but not choice of regimen predicted having an unfavourable outcome. Conclusion Even though criteria for the choice of treatment regimen were not applied strictly, we have achieved acceptable outcomes in this cohort. To expand RR-TB care, treatment regimens should fit provision at primary health care level and take patient preferences into account."
https://openalex.org/W3080947518,"The universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) component of the multi-center EUSCREEN project is being piloted in Albania since January 1st 2018. The aim of this study was to explore mothers' perceptions about various elements of UNHS in Albania. A cross-sectional study was carried out in the three sites of UNHS in Albania, namely in Tirana, Kukës and Pogradec during May-June 2019. During this period 512 consecutively approached mothers giving birth to included maternity hospitals were interviewed face-to-face about different aspects of UNHS. Basic socio-demographic and socioeconomic information was also collected. Mean age of participating mothers was 28.6 years ± 5.5 years. The overwhelming majority (93%) of mothers knew what their baby was being tested for, 33% were aware that hearing screening was offered in maternity hospital, 94% were very satisfied/satisfied with UNHS and about 62% were very stressed/stressed waiting for screening results, with significant sociodemographic and socioeconomic differences. The main information source about UNHS was screening staff in the maternity hospitals where mothers gave birth, reported in 67% of cases. All mothers (100%) agreed on the importance of early detection of newborn hearing problems, all mothers were willing to be informed early if their newborn baby had a hearing problem and all mothers were willing to contribute financially for testing the hearing of their newborn baby. These findings should guide information and education campaigns about UNHS in Albania. The public willingness to financially support neonatal hearing testing should be considered as an opportunity to achieve universal newborn hearing screening in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3080195127,"Previous work demonstrates that the hearing loss in Alport mice is caused by defects in the stria vascularis. As the animals age, progressive thickening of strial capillary basement membranes (SCBMs) occurs associated with elevated levels of extracellular matrix expression and hypoxia-related gene and protein expression. These conditions render the animals susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss. In an effort to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how the underlying mutation in the COL4A3 gene influences homeostasis in the stria vascularis, we performed vascular permeability studies combined with RNA-seq analysis using isolated stria vascularis from 7-week old wild-type and Alport mice on the 129 Sv background. Alport SCBMs were found to be less permeable than wild-type littermates. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis revealed 68 genes were induced and 61 genes suppressed in the stria from Alport mice relative to wild-type using a cut-off of 2-fold. These included pathways involving transcription factors associated with the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses as well as cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors that are up- or down-regulated. Canonical pathways included modulation of genes associated with glucose and glucose-1-PO4 degradation, NAD biosynthesis, histidine degradation, calcium signaling, and glutamate receptor signaling (among others). In all, the data point to the Alport stria being in an inflammatory state with disruption in numerous metabolic pathways indicative of metabolic stress, a likely cause for the susceptibility of Alport mice to noise-induced hearing loss under conditions that do not cause permanent hearing loss in age/strain-matched wild-type mice. The work lays the foundation for studies aimed at understanding the nature of strial pathology in Alport mice. The modulation of these genes under conditions of therapeutic intervention may provide important pre-clinical data to justify trials in humans afflicted with the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3080487344,"Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria since 2005 in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a regular surveillance of the ACT efficacy is required to ensure the treatment effectiveness. Mutations in the propeller domain of the pfk13 gene were identified as molecular markers of artemisinin resistance (ART-R). This study investigated the pfk13-propeller gene polymorphism in clinical isolates of P. falciparum collected in the DRC. In 2017, ten geographical sites across DRC were selected for a cross-sectional study that was conducted first in Kinshasa from January to March, then in the nine other sites from September to December. Dried blood samples were collected from patients attending health centers for fever where diagnosis of Malaria was first made by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) available on site (SD Bioline malaria Ag Pf or CareStart Malaria Pf) or by thick blood smear and then confirmed by a P. falciparum real-time PCR assay. A pfk13-propeller segment containing a fragment that codes for amino acids at positions 427–595 was amplified by conventional PCR before sequencing. In total, 1070 patients were enrolled in the study. Real-time PCR performed confirmed the initial diagnosis of P. falciparum infection in 806 samples (75.3%; 95% CI: 72.6%– 77.9%). Of the 717 successfully sequenced P. falciparum isolates, 710 (99.0%; 95% CI: 97.9% - 99.6) were wild-type genotypes and 7 (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.4% - 2.1%) carried non-synonymous (NS) mutations in pfk13-propeller including 2 mutations (A578S and V534A) previously detected and 2 other (M472I and A569T) not yet detected in the DRC. Mutations associated with ART-R in Southeast Asia were not observed in DRC. However, the presence of other mutations in pfk13-propeller gene calls for further investigations to assess their implication in drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3080601133,"Background Influenza viruses remain a global threat with the potential to trigger outbreaks and pandemics. Globally, seasonal influenza viruses’ mortality range from 291 243–645 832 annually, of which 17% occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa. We sought to estimate the overall prevalence of influenza infections in Kenya, identifying factors influencing the distribution of these infections, and describe trends in occurrence from 2007 to 2013. Methods Surveillance was conducted at eight district hospital sites countrywide. Participants who met the case definition for influenza-like illness were enrolled in the surveillance program. The nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from all participants. We tested all specimens for influenza viruses with quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. Bivariate and multivariate log-binomial regression was performed with a statistically significant level of p<0.005. An administrative map of Kenya was used to locate the geographical distribution of surveillance sites in counties. We visualized the monthly trend of influenza viruses with a graph and chart using exponential smoothing at a damping factor of 0.5 over the study period (2007–2013). Results A total of 17446 participants enrolled in the program. The overall prevalence of influenza viruses was 19% (n = 3230), of which 76% (n = 2449) were type A, 21% (n = 669) type B and 3% (n = 112) A/ B coinfection. Of those with type A, 59% (n = 1451) were not subtyped. Seasonal influenza A/H3N2 was found in 48% (n = 475), influenza A/H1N1/pdm 2009 in 43% (n = 434), and seasonal influenza A/ H1N1 in 9% (n = 88) participants. Both genders were represented, whereas a large proportion of participants 55% were ≤1year age. Influenza prevalence was high, 2 times more in other age categories compared to ≤1year age. Category of occupation other than children and school attendees had a high prevalence of influenza virus (p< <0.001). The monthly trends of influenza viruses’ positivity showed no seasonal pattern. Influenza types A and B co-circulated throughout the annual calendar during seven years of the surveillance. Conclusions Influenza viruses circulate year-round and occur among children as well as the adult population in Kenya. Occupational and school-based settings showed a higher prevalence of influenza viruses. There were no regular seasonal patterns for influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3080733662,"Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) comprises both natural and unnatural causes of death. However, few epidemiological surveys have investigated SUDI in Japan.This retrospective study was conducted to investigate the latest trends of circumstances and risk factors of SUDI cases in which collapse occurred during sleep.Forensic pathology sections from eight universities participated in the selection of subjects from 2013 to 2018. Data obtained from the checklist form were analyzed based on information at postmortem.There were 259 SUDI cases consisting of 145 male infants and 114 female infants with a mean birth weight of 2888 ± 553 and 2750 ± 370 g, respectively. Deaths most frequently occurred among infants at 1 month of age (18%). According to population data as the control, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of mother's age ≤19 years was 11.1 (6.9-17.7) compared with ages 30-39. The odds ratio for the fourth- and later born infants was 5.2 (3.4-7.9) compared with the frequency of first-born infants. The most frequent time of day for discovery was between 7 and 8 o'clock, and the time difference from the last seen alive was a mean of 4.1 h. Co-sleeping was recorded for 61%, and the prone position was found for 40% of cases at discovery. Mother's smoking habit exhibited an odds ratio of 4.5 (2.9-5.8).This study confirmed the trends that have been observed for sudden infant death syndrome; particularly, very high odds ratios were evident for teenage mothers and later birth order in comparison with those in other developed countries. Neglect was suspected in some cases of the prolonged time to discovery of unreactive infants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an extensive survey of SUDI during sleep in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W3080352668,"Transcriptomic responses of plants to weed presence gives insight on the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in the stress response. This study evaluated transcriptomic and morphological responses of two teosinte (Zea mays ssp parviglumis) (an ancestor of domesticated maize) lines (Ames 21812 and Ames 21789) to weed presence and absence during two growing seasons. Responses were compared after 6 weeks of growth in Aurora, South Dakota, USA. Plant heights between treatments were similar in Ames 21812, whereas branch number decreased when weeds were present. Ames 21789 was 45% shorter in weedy vs weed-free plots, but branch numbers were similar between treatments. Season-long biomass was reduced in response to weed stress in both lines. Common down-regulated subnetworks in weed-stressed plants were related to light, photosynthesis, and carbon cycles. Several unique response networks (e.g. aging, response to chitin) and gene sets were present in each line. Comparing transcriptomic responses of maize (determined in an adjacent study) and teosinte lines indicated three common gene ontologies up-regulated when weed-stressed: jasmonic acid response/signaling, UDP-glucosyl and glucuronyltransferases, and quercetin glucosyltransferase (3-O and 7-O). Overall, morphologic and transcriptomic differences suggest a greater varietal (rather than a conserved) response to weed stress, and implies multiple responses are possible. These findings offer insights into opportunities to define and manipulate gene expression of several different pathways of modern maize varieties to improve performance under weedy conditions."

However, there is a paucity of evidence on the delay in new adult pulmonary Tuberculosis patients to initiate treatment in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia.To assess the factors associated with treatment initiation delay among new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia.The study design was cross-sectional. A total of 875 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients were recruited from 21 health facilities from October 2018 to October 2019. Health facilities were selected by simple random sampling technique and tuberculosis cases from the health facilities were consecutively enrolled. Data were collected using structured questionnaire within the first 2 weeks of treatment initiation. Delay was categorized as patient, health system and total delays. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the odds of delays to initiate treatment. A p-value of less than 0.05 was reported as statistically significant.The median patient, health system and total delays were 30, 18 and 62 days, respectively. Rural residence, being poor, visiting non-formal medication sources, being primary health care and the private clinic had higher odds of patient delay whereas being HIV positive had lower odds of patient delay. Illiteracy, first visit to primary health care and private clinic had higher odds of health system delay whereas a visit to health facility one time and have no patient delay had lower odds of health system delay.The median patient delay was higher than the median health system delay before initiating treatment. Hence, improved awareness of the community and involving the informal medication sources in the tuberculosis pathways would reduce patient delay. Similarly, improved cough screening and diagnostic efficiency of the lower health facilities would shorten health system delay."
https://openalex.org/W3080814578,"This study aimed to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) and self-rated health (SRH) in Korean adults.The study included 214,997 adults who participated in the 2016 Korean Community Health Survey. Participants were categorized into four groups according to WHO Asian classification based on their BMI: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal-weight (18.5-22.9 kg/m2), overweight (23.0‒24.9 kg/m2), obese (25.0‒29.9 kg/m2), and severely obese (≥30.0 kg/m2). Multivariate Poisson regression analysis with sampling weights and robust variance estimators was performed to evaluate the relationship between BMI categories and poor SRH.A J-shaped association was observed between BMI and poor SRH in both sexes. Compared to normal-weight subjects, the age, lifestyle, and comorbidities adjusted prevalence rate ratios (PRRs) in men for poor SRH were 1.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-1.88) for underweight, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.92) for overweight, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.93-1.03) for obese, and 1.79 (95% CI, 1.63-1.97) for severely obese. In women, compared to normal-weight subjects, the age, lifestyle, and comorbidities adjusted PRRs for poor SRH were 1.33 (95% CI, 1.26-1.41) for underweight, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.98-1.06) for overweight, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.10-1.19) for obese, and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.31-1.53) for severely obese. Associations between underweight and SRH were stronger at older ages than at younger ages, whereas those between high BMI and SRH were stronger at younger ages than at older ages.This cross-sectional study using a nationally representative survey observed a J-shaped relationship between BMI and poor SRH. This association differed depending on age and presence or absence of comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3081359726,"Objectives Incentivising vaccine consent form return may improve vaccine uptake and be seen as less coercive than incentivising vaccination itself. We assessed the acceptability of financial incentives in this context among adolescent females and explored potential mechanisms by which incentives might change behaviour. Design Focus groups and analysis of free-text questionnaire responses. Methods Study 1: 36 female secondary students in London (age 13–14) participated in six focus groups exploring the use of incentives in the context of vaccination. Data were analysed thematically. Study 2: was conducted to triangulate the findings of Study 1, by analysing free-text questionnaire responses from 181 female secondary students in London (age 12–13) reporting their opinion of incentivising consent form return. Data from Study 1 was also used to explore perceived potential mechanisms of action by which incentives might encourage consent form return. Results Focus group participants had positive attitudes towards incentives, with 61% of free-text responses also expressing this. Most focus group participants thought that incentives would encourage consent form return (18% of free-text respondents spontaneously also mentioned this). While incentivising consent form return was seen as ethical, focus group participants who incorrectly thought that vaccine receipt was being incentivised raised concerns about bribery, although only 4% of free text respondents reported these concerns. Frequently raised mechanisms of action included incentives increasing engagement with, and the perceived value of consent form return. Conclusions Adolescents had positive views of financially incentivising consent form return to promote vaccine uptake, although care must be taken to reduce misconceptions regarding what is being incentivised. Incentivising vaccination was seen as coercive, but incentivising actions that increase the likelihood of vaccination (i.e. consent form return) were not. Incentives may encourage adolescents to return consent forms by helping them engage with this behaviour or increasing its’ perceived value."
https://openalex.org/W3035103284,"With the great significance of biomolecular flexibility in biomolecular dynamics and functional analysis, various experimental and theoretical models are developed. Experimentally, Debye-Waller factor, also known as B-factor, measures atomic mean-square displacement and is usually considered as an important measurement for flexibility. Theoretically, elastic network models, Gaussian network model, flexibility-rigidity model, and other computational models have been proposed for flexibility analysis by shedding light on the biomolecular inner topological structures. Recently, a topology-based machine learning model has been proposed. By using the features from persistent homology, this model achieves a remarkable high Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) in protein B-factor prediction. Motivated by its success, we propose weighted-persistent-homology (WPH)-based machine learning (WPHML) models for RNA flexibility analysis. Our WPH is a newly-proposed model, which incorporate physical, chemical and biological information into topological measurements using a weight function. In particular, we use local persistent homology (LPH) to focus on the topological information of local regions. Our WPHML model is validated on a well-established RNA dataset, and numerical experiments show that our model can achieve a PCC of up to 0.5822. The comparison with the previous sequence-information-based learning models shows that a consistent improvement in performance by at least 10% is achieved in our current model."

https://openalex.org/W3080731104,"The main goal of the present study was to explore the latent structure of extended psychosis phenotypes in a representative sample of adolescents. Moreover, associations with socio-emotional adjustment, academic achievement, and neurocognition performance across the latent profiles were compared. Participants were 1506 students, 667 males (44.3%), derived from random cluster sampling. Various tools were used to measure psychosis risk, subjective well-being, academic performance, and neurocognition. Based on three psychometric indicators of psychosis risk (schizotypal traits, psychotic-like experiences, and bipolar-like experiences), four latent classes were found: non-risk, low-risk, high reality distortion experiences, and high psychosis liability. The high-risk latent groups scored significantly higher on mental health difficulties, and negative affect, and lower on positive affect and well-being, compared to the two non-risk groups. Moreover, these high-risk groups had a significantly higher number of failed academic subjects compared to the non-risk groups. In addition, no statistically significant differences in efficiency performance were found in the neurocognitive domains across the four latent profiles. This study allows us to improve the early identification of adolescents at risk of serious mental disorder in school settings in order to prevent the incidence and burden associated with these kinds of mental health problems."

Information obtained by questionnaire included: demographic and socioeconomic status, knowledge about DR, and ocular and medical history. The primary outcome was whether the participant knew that DM can affect the eyes, defined according to the question: ""Do you know diabetes mellitus (DM) can affect eyes? (yes or no)"". A knowledge score was calculated based on the responses to seven questions, with 1 point awarded for a correct response and 0 points for an incorrect or uncertain answer.A total of 1972 diabetic patients were included in the study with an average age of 65.2±10.8 years, 45.7% were male. One thousand two hundred and nineteen patients (61.8%) knew that DM can affect the eyes. Significant differences in age, education, income status, insurance covering eye care, fasting blood glucose, duration of DM, history of hypertension existed between subjects who knew and those who did not know that DM can affect the eyes (P<0.05 for all). The proportion of correct answers to the DR knowledge questions ranged from 33.3% to 61.8%, with an average score of 3.65±2.47. In the multiple regression analysis, the knowledge score was significantly associated with age, education, income, history of hypertension, duration of DM, being told that regular examinations should be performed and concern about vision loss (P <0.01 for all).The knowledge toward DR among DM patients were still low within the chronic disease management system in eastern China. Routine ophthalmic screening, health care promotions, and educational programs should be emphasized and implemented for better DR prevention and management."
https://openalex.org/W3081457493,"Complex social-ecological systems can be difficult to study and manage. Simulation models can facilitate exploration of system behavior under novel conditions, and participatory modeling can involve stakeholders in developing appropriate management processes. Participatory modeling already typically involves qualitative structural validation of models with stakeholders, but with increased data and more sophisticated models, quantitative behavioral validation may be possible as well. In this study, we created a novel agent-based-model applied to a specific context: Zimbabwean non-governmental organization the Muonde Trust has been collecting data on their agro-pastoral system for the last 35 years and had concerns about land-use planning and the effectiveness of management interventions in the face of climate change. We collaboratively created an agent-based model of their system using their data archive, qualitatively calibrating it to the observed behavior of the real system without tuning any parameters to match specific quantitative outputs. We then behaviorally validated the model using quantitative community-based data and conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the relative impact of underlying parameter assumptions, Indigenous management interventions, and different rainfall variation scenarios. We found that our process resulted in a model which was successfully structurally validated and sufficiently realistic to be useful for Muonde researchers as a discussion tool. The model was inconsistently behaviorally validated, however, with some model variables matching field data better than others. We observed increased model system instability due to increasing variability in underlying drivers (rainfall), and also due to management interventions that broke feedbacks between the components of the system. Interventions that smoothed year-to-year variation rather than exaggerating it tended to improve sustainability. The Muonde trust has used the model to successfully advocate to local leaders for changes in land-use planning policy that will increase the sustainability of their system."
https://openalex.org/W3080221471,"The main objective of the study was to analyze deviations in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements caused by the displacement of circular optic disc optical coherence tomography scans. High-density radial scans of the optic nerve heads of cynomolgus monkeys were acquired. The retinal nerve fiber layer was manually segmented, and a surface plot of the discrete coordinates was generated. From this plot, the RNFL thicknesses were calculated and compared between accurately centered and intentionally displaced circle scans. Circle scan displacement caused circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness deviations of increasing magnitude with increasing center offset. As opposed to the human eye, horizontal displacement resulted in larger RNFL thickness deviations than vertical displacement in cynomolgus monkeys. Acquisition of high-density radial scans allowed for the mathematical reconstruction and modelling of the nerve fiber layer and extrapolation of its thickness. Accurate and strictly repeatable circle scan placement is critical to obtain reproducible values, which is essential for longitudinal studies."
https://openalex.org/W3080461003,"Individual growth rates are intrinsically related to survival and lifetime reproductive success and hence, are key determinants of population growth. Efforts to quantify age-size relationships are hampered by difficulties in aging individuals in wild populations. In addition, species with complex life-histories often show distinct shifts in growth that cannot be readily accommodated by traditional modelling techniques. Amphibians are often characterized by rapid larval growth, cessation of growth prior to metamorphosis, and resumption of growth in the adult stage. Compounding issues of non-linear growth, amphibian monitoring programs typically sample larval and adult populations using dissimilar methods. Here we present the first multistage growth model that combines disparate data collected across life-history stages. We model the growth of the endangered Reticulated Flatwoods Salamander, Ambystoma bishopi, in a Bayesian framework, that accounts for unknown ages, individual heterogeneity, and reconciles dip-net and drift fence sampling designs. Flatwoods salamanders achieve 60% of growth in the first 3 months of life but can survive for up to 13 years as a terrestrial adult. We find evidence for marked variability in growth rate, the timing and age at metamorphosis, and maximum size, within populations. Average size of metamorphs in a given year appeared strongly dependent on hydroperiod, and differed by >10mm across years with successful recruitment. In contrast, variation in the sizes of emerging metamorphs appeared relatively constant across years. An understanding of growth will contribute to the development of population viability analyses for flatwoods salamanders, will guide management actions, and will ultimately aid the recovery of the species. Our model formulation has broad applicability to amphibians, and likely any stage-structured organism in which homogenous data cannot be collected across life-stages. The tendency to ignore stage-structure or omit non-conforming data in growth analyses can no longer be afforded given the high stakes of management decisions, particularly for endangered or at-risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W3080781049,"The larvae of Drosophila melanogaster grow rapidly through use of a highly truncated cell cycle in which mitosis is entirely eliminated. The Drosophila homolog of the protooncogene transcription factor Myc plays a major role in promoting this endopolyploid (EP) growth. We have previously determined that the gene jim lovell (lov), which encodes a member of the BTB/POZ (Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, Broad/Pox virus zinc finger) domain family of transcription factors, is also required for EP growth in one larval tissue, the trachea. Here we show that lov promotes EP growth in three further tissues indicating a fundamental role in this process. However, epistasis experiments revealed heterogeneity in lov's action in these tissues. Whereas in the tracheae and salivary glands lov acts downstream of Myc, in the fat body, reduced expression of lov does not impede the action of Myc, indicating an upstream action for the gene. We show here that lov's regulation of the gene uninflatable (uif) in the tracheae is a component of this difference. uif is required for tracheal EP growth downstream of Myc and lov but has no equivalent role in the fat body. Although Uif is a transmembrane component of the plasma membrane in the tracheae, its action downstream of Myc suggests an intracellular role for the protein in the tracheae. In addition to regulating uif expression in some tissues we also show that lov locates to the nucleolus, indicating it can function in both polymerase I and polymerase II transcriptional events. Our major finding is that tissue-specific mechanisms can interact with universal growth promotion by Myc to generate the individual endopolyploid organs of the larvae."
https://openalex.org/W3080891649,"Introduction Complete follow-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed infants (HEI) is crucial for a successful prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. This study analyzed the HEI follow-up and factors associated with loss to follow-up (LTFU) in southern Mozambique. Methods This retrospective cohort study used the data of HEI enrolled between June 2017 and June 2018, followed-up for 18 months. The outcomes were the proportion of infants with completed follow-up and a definitive diagnosis, and the presence of clinical events. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative probability of LTFU and of clinical events. Factors associated with LTFU and clinical events were analyzed using Cox regression to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and adjusted HR (AHR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a significance cutoff of p<0.05. Results 1413 infants were enrolled (49% males) at a median age of 32 days (IQR 31–41); the median follow-up time was 12 months (IQR 8.2–14.2); 1129 (80%) completed follow-up and had a definitive diagnosis, 58 (4%) were HIV-positive, 225 (16%) were LTFU; 266 (19%) presented a clinical event. Factors associated with LTFU were: age >2 months at entry (AHR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.12–2.23), non-exclusive breastfeeding (AHR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01–2.06), poor cotrimoxazole adherence (AHR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.59–7.35), and clinical events (AHR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34–0.77). Factors associated with clinical events were: malnutrition (AHR, 10.06; 95% CI, 5.92–17.09), non-exclusive breastfeeding (AHR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.34–2.93), no nevirapine prophylaxis (AHR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.18–2.36), and poor cotrimoxazole adherence (AHR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.10–6.22). Conclusion The high rate of HEI LTFU, associated with delayed linkage to postnatal care, poor prophylaxis adherence, non-exclusive breastfeeding, indicates the need to design a differentiated service delivery model that is tailored to the mothers’ and infants’ specific needs."

For somatic cell nuclear transfer applications, it is essential to know whether clone(s) produced from semen-derived epithelial cells (SedECs) are healthy and reproductively competent. In this study, the semen and fertility profile of a cloned bull (C1) that was produced from a SedEC were compared with its donor (D1) and with two cloned bulls (C2, C3) that were produced from commonly used skin-derived fibroblast cells (SkdFCs). We observed variations in some fresh semen parameters (ejaculated volume and mass motility), frozen-thawed sperm parameters (plasma membrane integrity, and computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) indices), but values are within the normal expected range. There was no difference in sperm concentration of ejaculated semen and frozen-thawed semen parameters which include sperm motility, percentage of live and normal morphology sperm, and distance traveled through oestrus mucus. Following in vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments, zygotes from C1 had higher (P < 0.05) cleavage rates (81%) than C2, C3, and D1 (71%, 67%, and 75%, respectively); however, blastocyst development per cleaved embryo and quality of produced blastocysts did not differ. The conception rate of C1 was 46% (7/15) and C2 was 50% (8/15) following artificial insemination with frozen-thawed semen. Established pregnancies resulted in births of 7 and 6 progenies sired by C1 and C2, respectively, and all calves show no signs of phenotypical abnormalities. These results showed that semen from a cloned bull derived from SedECs is equivalent to semen from its donor bull and bulls cloned from SkdFCs."

Treatment with the protease inhibitor E64 followed by filtration through a 1.2 μm filter is being used to purify merozoites for immunologic assays. However, there have been no studies to determine the effect of these treatments on the susceptibility of merozoites to complement or antibodies. To address this gap, we purified merozoites with or without E64 followed by filtration through either a 1.2 or 2.7 μm filter, or no filtration. Merozoites were then incubated in either 10% fresh or heat-inactivated serum followed by surface staining and flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies against the complement effector molecules C3b or C5b9. To determine the effect of anti-merozoite antibodies, we incubated merozoites with MAb5.2, a mouse monoclonal antibody that targets the merozoite surface protein 1. We used an amine-reactive fluorescent dye to measure membrane integrity. Treatment with E64 resulted in an insignificant increase in the proportion of merozoites that were C3b positive but in a significant increase in the proportion that were C5b9 positive. Filtration increased the proportion of merozoites that were either C3b or C5b9-positive. The combination of filtration and E64 treatment resulted in marked deposition of C3b and C5b9. MAb5.2 induced greater complement deposition than serum alone or an IgG2b isotype control. The combination of E64 treatment, filtration, and MAb5.2 resulted in very rapid and significant deposition of C5b9. Filtration through the 1.2 μm filter selected a population of merozoites with greater membrane integrity, but their integrity deteriorated rapidly upon exposure to serum. We conclude that E64 treatment and filtration increase the susceptibility of merozoites to complement and antibody. Filtered or E64-treated merozoites are not suitable for immunologic studies that address the efficacy of antibodies in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3080923981,"Rape is the most demoralizing type of crime violating human rights worldwide. Research has primarily focused on children and women’s experiences of rape, even though victims include men and little documentation available concerning their experiences of reporting these incidents. The study aimed to investigate men’s experiences when reporting rape to the police. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to collect and analyze qualitative data from a purposive sample of eleven men who were rape victims. The findings of the study revealed three superordinate and twenty-two subordinate themes. First, motivation for reporting rape to the police included self-protection from re-victimization, being killed, and prevalent prison cultural practice, seeking justice and answers for rape, moral duty, family support, and encouraging reports of the crime. Second, perceived barriers for reporting rape included fear of stigmatization and ridicule, unknown perpetrators, internalized homophobia, men’s preconceived prejudices, perceived justice system delays, fear of being killed, and protecting their reputation. Third, negative experiences when reporting rape included a long waiting period at the reception before opening a case file and the delayed responses of police investigating the rape scene. Also, there was discouragement from the police, disparaging behavior of police, victim-blaming, lack of communication with the victim about case progress and experiences of police homosexual intolerance. The findings show that most men were motivated to report rape to the police despite the perceived barriers and negative experiences they had with the police. Thus, this provides baseline evidence for strategies to be developed to encourage the reporting of rape. Each police station must provide dedicated personnel for professional and sensitive handling of all rape victims, including men. Furthermore, future studies should be conducted to evaluate rape victims’ satisfaction with the services provided by the police."
https://openalex.org/W3081119867,"Objective Mental health is an essential issue during adolescence. The number of students who use counseling services is increasing in universities. We attempted to confirm the characteristics of the students who access counseling services using both psychological tests and pulse rate variability (PRV) for better support for students’ academic success. Methods We recruited the participants for this study from the students who had counseling sessions at Kanazawa University (Group S). As a control group, we also recruited students who had no experience in counseling services (Group H). We obtained health information from the database of annual health checkups. Participants received the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Sukemune-Hiew (S-H) Resilience Test, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-JYZ (STAI). We also studied the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12v2) for testing Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). As a physiological test, we examined the spectral analyses of pulse rate variability (PRV) by accelerating plethysmography. We performed a linear analysis of PRV for low-frequency power (LF: 0.02–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency power (HF: 0.15–0.50 Hz). We also conducted a non-linear analysis of PRV for the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). Additionally, we examined participants’ blood for autoantibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65. Results A total of 105 students participated in this study. Group S had 37 participants (Male: 26, Female: 11), and Group H had 68 participants (Male: 27, Female 41). There were five males and one female in Group S who had diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and three males in Group S were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by medical institutes. Additionally, four males and two females in Group S had diagnoses of ASD with ADHD by medical institutes. A male with ASD in Group S had epilepsy. The students of Group S had characteristics as follows: 1) lower power of Working Memory Index (WMI) despite high Full-Scale Intelligent Quotient (FSIQ), 2) higher ASD traits especially in Male, 3) lower resilience powers, 4) higher anxiety trait, 5) lower Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in Role/social component in both Male and Female, 6) lower HRQOL in Mental component in Male 7) shifting of autonomic nervous balance toward higher sympathetic activity. Conclusion We could confirm the characteristics of students who visited counseling rooms for mental support (Group S). We also found gender differences in specificities of Group S. The educational system is changing rapidly to adjust social requests. These changes make conflict with the features of students of Group S. We should think about appropriate supports for the students who would pioneer the future of humanity."
https://openalex.org/W3081426709,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition due to a dysregulated immunological response to infection. Apart from source control and broad-spectrum antibiotics, management is based on fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drugs. Fluid resuscitation implicates the risk of volume overload, which in turn is associated with longer stay in intensive care, prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and increased mortality. Antisecretory factor (AF), an endogenous protein, is detectable in most tissues and in plasma. The biologically active site of the protein is located in an 8-peptide sequence, contained in a synthetic 16-peptide fragment, named AF-16. The protein as well as the peptide AF-16 has multiple modulatory effects on abnormal fluid transport and edema formation/resolution as well as in a variety of inflammatory conditions. Apart from its' anti-secretory and anti-inflammatory characteristics, AF is an inhibitor of capillary leakage in intestine. It is not known whether the protein AF or the peptide AF-16 can ameliorate symptoms in sepsis. We hypothesized that AF-16 decreases the degree of hemodynamic instability, the need of fluid resuscitation, vasopressor dose and tissue edema in fecal peritonitis. To test the hypothesis, we induced peritonitis and sepsis by injecting autologous fecal solution into abdominal cavity of anesthetized pigs, and randomized (in a blind manner) the animals to intervention (AF-16, n = 8) or control (saline, n = 8) group. After the onset of hemodynamic instability (defined as mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg maintained for > 5 minutes), intervention with AF-16 (20 mg/kg (50 mg/ml) in 0.9% saline) intravenously (only the vehicle in the control group) and a protocolized resuscitation was started. We recorded respiratory and hemodynamic parameters hourly for twenty hours or until the animal died and collected post mortem tissue samples at the end of the experiment. No differences between the groups were observed regarding hemodynamics, overall fluid balance, lung mechanics, gas exchange or histology. However, liver wet-to-dry ratio remained lower in AF-16 treated animals as compared to controls, 3.1 ± 0.4, (2.7-3.5, 95% CI, n = 8) vs 4.0 ± 0.6 (3.4-4.5, 95% CI, n = 8), p = 0.006, respectively. Bearing in mind the limited sample size, this experimental pilot study suggests that AF-16 may inhibit sepsis induced liver edema in peritonitis-sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3067684911,"The clock read 11 p.m. and I was still in the lab, staring at my poster abstract for what felt like the millionth time. I couldn't focus. But going home wasn't an option. My adviser had required me, and the rest of my labmates, to stay in the lab until she had time to read all of our abstracts. The submission deadline wasn't for a few days, but she had decided she wanted to meet early with each of us to discuss the single-paragraph descriptions of our work. We waited dutifully as each lab member took their turn. None of us dared to leave—or to challenge our boss. I didn't get home until 1:30 a.m.



> “The last thing you want is an adviser who brings you down.” 

It was one more reminder that I should have been more careful when selecting a graduate adviser. Unfortunately, I was foolish enough not to give mentoring style a second thought. I was simply happy to have received an offer.

Part of the problem was that I had limited options. I had moved to the United States with my husband, who had a good job in a particular city. It had only one university, with only one department that really interested me. So I started to volunteer in a research lab there.

I was a regular attendee at departmental seminars, and that's where I met my future adviser. After she presented a seminar, I approached her and we set up a time to chat. We had a productive discussion about her research. Later, I went to dinner with her lab group.

I didn't pick up any signs of trouble, although one person who worked in a lab that shared space with hers did tell me about coming across one of her lab members crying in the breakroom. Naively, I ignored that warning sign. Within a few weeks, the faculty member offered me a position in her lab as a master's student. The opportunity seemed too good to pass up. I hoped it would work out.

It wasn't long before reality set in. Group meetings were dreadful. Our adviser was often angry and verbally abusive. She persistently micromanaged her lab members and pitted us against one another. Once, she sent an irate email on a federal holiday, asking us why we weren't working. “The only lab that is empty is ours,” she wrote. “How is this possible? Don't you have experiments or data to analyze?”

The situation wore me down, and I lost motivation to do my work. I wondered whether I should quit, but as an international student, I felt trapped. If I dropped out of my program, I'd not only be out of a job, but I'd also lose my student visa status. So I stuck it out and waited for the right moment to jump ship.

I applied to upgrade from the master's program to the Ph.D. program. That option wasn't available until I'd completed 1 year of graduate school, but it ultimately gave me a ticket out of her lab.

As I looked for a new adviser, I was careful not to repeat the mistakes I had made in the past. I approached another faculty member whose research interested me. But when I visited his lab, I paid attention to how he interacted with others, and I spoke with people who worked with him, specifically asking about his mentoring style. I was amazed how friendly everyone was. His students had great regard for him, and I immediately sensed that his lab was an environment where I could thrive.

He took me on as a Ph.D. student, rescuing me from the misery I'd felt in graduate school up to that point. In my new lab, I arrived eager to work each day, and I didn't go home mentally exhausted by interpersonal disputes. That helped me be much more determined and efficient with my work.

Grad school is a tough, long road that requires patience and perseverance. Finding a lab that is a good match for you is critical. I encourage prospective students to learn from my mistakes and to do your due diligence before joining a lab. Ask a lot of questions and seek a lot of diverse opinions—because the last thing you want is an adviser who brings you down."
